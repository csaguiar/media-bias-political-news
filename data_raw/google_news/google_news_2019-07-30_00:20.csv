Trump Makes Tone-Deaf Joke About Stage Collapsing Under First Responders During 9/11 Bill Signing,https://www.thedailybeast.com,['Justin Baragona'],07-29-2019,2019,7,https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-makes-tone-deaf-joke-about-stage-collapsing-under-first-responders-during-911-bill-signing,"Just before signing into law a permanent extension of the 9/11 victims compensation fund on Monday, President Donald Trump jokingly told the 9/11 first responders in attendance that they shouldn’t worry if the Rose Garden stage collapsed underneath them because they wouldn’t fall “very far.”

After suggesting that he was directly involved with the cleanup efforts at Ground Zero immediately after the Sept. 11 terror attacks—a claim that has been disputed by those at the scene at the time—the president wrapped up the signing ceremony by inviting a group of first responders and their families to join him.

“Now I am going to sign this bill into law, and I don’t know if this stage will hold it, but if it doesn’t, we are not falling very far,” Trump declared, motioning down towards the structure.

He continued: “I would like to ask the families, and I would also like to ask the First Responders to stand up. And we’ll give this stage a shot. Let’s see how well built—Made in America, let’s see how well-built it is. OK?”

The jokey remark was especially tone-deaf considering how thousands of people died when the World Trade Center’s Twin Towers collapsed. And it didn’t take long for people to express outrage and disbelief over the inappropriate quip.

“You still got it, Donny,” comedian Patton Oswalt sarcastically noted on Twitter.

“What kind of person ‘jokes’ about a structure collapsing and people falling while signing a bill to compensate victims from a horrific traumatic event in which a structure collapsed and people fell to their death?” political scientist Brian Klaas wondered.

“Get it? Because they might be nervous about structures collapsing, ha ha!” Vox’s David Roberts tweeted.

Muslim-Americans, meanwhile, contrasted the president’s remarks with his recent condemnation of Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) for supposedly downplaying the 9/11 terror attacks, asking how folks would react if Omar, or any Muslim woman, would have made this joke."

Republican Senators Are Cool to Trump’s Choice for Top Intelligence Post,https://www.nytimes.com,"['Julian E. Barnes', 'Nicholas Fandos', 'Adam Goldman']",07-29-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/29/us/politics/trump-ratcliffe-national-intelligence.html,"WASHINGTON — Republicans hesitated on Monday to embrace President Trump’s choice for the director of national intelligence, and some privately expressed doubts about his potential confirmation, echoing concerns of experts and Democrats that he was too inexperienced and too partisan.

Mr. Trump’s pick, Representative John Ratcliffe of Texas, could face an uphill battle, Senate Republicans said in private conversations. Several said they wanted to keep the intelligence post apolitical, and Mr. Ratcliffe will need to show he can move beyond the die-hard conservative persona that has made him a star in the House and on Fox News but less well known among senators who will decide whether to confirm him.

Republicans on the Senate Intelligence Committee, including its chairman, Richard M. Burr of North Carolina, said they were unfamiliar with the congressman. “I don’t know John Ratcliffe,” Mr. Burr said. “I talked to him on the phone last night — it’s the first contact I’ve ever had with him. I look forward to getting to know him, and if I get an official nomination, I’ll process it through the committee.”

Another Republican committee member, Senator Susan Collins of Maine, who helped craft the 2004 law that created the position of director of national intelligence, said the job should be filled by someone “with the integrity and skill and ability to bring all the members of the intelligence community together.”"
"Trump aide submitted drafts of 2016 'America First' energy speech to UAE for edits, emails show",https://abcnews.go.com,['Abc News'],,,,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-aide-submitted-drafts-2016-america-energy-speech/story?id=64634140,"When candidate Donald Trump prepared to give a major energy speech during the 2016 campaign, one of his closest advisers provided a pre-speech review to senior United Arab Emirates officials, an unorthodox move that caught the attention of federal investigators, according to emails and text messages uncovered by a House Oversight Committee investigation.

“The Trump Administration has virtually obliterated the lines normally separating government policy making from corporate and foreign interests,” according to a report overseen by House Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings, a Maryland Democrat, who commissioned the investigation into back channel business dealings between certain Trump aides and Middle Eastern countries.

Two weeks before Trump was scheduled to deliver the energy policy speech, Thomas Barrack, a California investment tycoon with extensive contacts in the Middle East and who later helped oversee Trump’s inauguration, provided a former business associate inside the United Arab Emirates with an advance copy of the candidate’s planned remarks. The associate then told Barrack he shared them with UAE and Saudi government officials, after which Barrack arranged for language requested by the UAE officials to be added to the speech with the help of Trump’s campaign manager at the time, Paul Manafort.

“This is the most likely final version of the speech. It has the language you want,” Manafort confirmed in an email to Barrack on the day of the speech, according to the report. Manafort has since gone to prison for financial crimes unrelated to his campaign work.

The White House declined to comment.

House investigators note in their report that none of the documents they gathered indicate “whether Trump was aware that drafts of his speech were circulated to foreign officials in the Middle East or that feedback had been provided through Mr. Barrack and Mr. Manafort.”

Attorneys for Manafort declined to comment when reached Monday.

The back-channel exchange caught the attention not only of House investigators but also of federal prosecutors, according to a report late Sunday in The New York Times, which first reported on the dealings.

ABC News has obtained copies of more detailed emails and texts from House investigators, who gathered more than 60,000 documents showing what they say are the intermingling of private interests and public policy decision by Trump aides both before and after he took office. The resulting investigative report, made public Monday, presents events surrounding the 2016 energy speech as a prime example of how Trump’s close aides were granting their foreign business contacts access to campaign policy decisions.

A source close to Barrack confirmed the basic details to ABC News. A statement from Barrack’s spokesman, first published by The Times, said prosecutors had confirmed to Barrack’s attorney that “they have no further questions for Mr. Barrack.” His aides told The Times he never worked on behalf of foreign states or entities and he was ultimately disappointed that more of the language sought by his contacts in the Middle East did not wind up in Trump’s speech.

Trump traveled to North Dakota in May of 2016, having just clinched the Republican nomination for president. He intended to give a policy speech that would solidify his position on oil, gas and coal – an energy speech that would make clear he would prioritize American energy jobs over grand multi-national environmental pacts like the Paris climate agreement.

Trump called his approach an “America First” energy plan that would “make America wealthy again.”

“Under my presidency, we will accomplish complete American energy independence,” he told the crowd. “Imagine a world in which our foes, and the oil cartels, can no longer use energy as a weapon.”

Play

In the midst of the muscular, America-first approach that became a hallmark of his campaign, he added a phrase intended to placate an audience far away in the United Arab Emirates, telling the crowd “we will work with our Gulf allies to develop a positive energy relationship as part of our anti-terrorism strategy.”

The language was modest when compared to what was requested by officials in the oil-rich emirates, according to the text messages exchanged between Barrack and Rashid al-Malik, a former business associate in UAE. Al-Malik had secretly worked as an intelligence asset for the UAE government, “tasked to report to his Emirati intelligence handlers on topics of consequence to the UAE,” the House report said, citing an Intercept news report.

William F. Coffield, an attorney for al-Malik, told ABC News his client “was never a conduit to the Trump organization for anyone. He has never been a paid intelligence source for anyone.”

“Mr. al-Malik is from the UAE and has a home in the U.S. He loves the UAE and the USA,” said Coffield. “He was a business associate of Mr Barrack’s, and they shared a personal desire to build bridges between the citizens of both. It’s really that simple.”

Barrack and al-Malik began the text message exchanges two weeks before Trump’s energy speech was set to be delivered, according to the House report. Barrack sent a draft of the candidate’s energy remarks to al-Malik and a message that said, “What do you think of his energy message given to American executives with a pro Middle East point of view -- for you and Saeed to rebiew [sic] for me quickly. I need a few pro Middle East aspects.” The report does not identify “Saeed.”

An hour later, al-Malik responded, “This is what I got from them,” according to the report.

The text does not identify “them,” but House investigators say they believe it is a reference to Saudi and Emirati officials. In that text, al-Malik requests that new language add references to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman and UAE Crown Prince Abudhabi Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, as well as a line that states: “We can and should support reform in the Middle East, in the process thereby reducing the appeal of Islamic terrorism, and support our allies who are fighting our enemies.”

The following day, Barrack proposes the additional language to Manafort, suggesting references to the two Arab leaders and language that loosely mirrors the sentiments that had been requested. He adds in his email, “This is probably as close as I can get without crossing a lot of lines,” according to the report.

The language that winds up in Trump’s speech ultimately does not include the direct references to the Gulf leaders but does include a nod to the requested sentiment – expressing his desire to “work with our Gulf allies to develop a positive energy relationship as part of our anti-terrorism strategy.”"
DOJ restricts asylum claims based on family relations,https://www.politico.com,['Ted Hesson'],07-29-2019,2019,7,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/07/29/doj-asylum-claims-family-relations-1624028,"Attorney General William Barr said that being part of a nuclear family targeted for persecution doesn’t qualify as a “particular social group” eligible for asylum in the United States. | Drew Angerer/Getty Images immigration DOJ restricts asylum claims based on family relations

A decision issued Monday by Attorney General William Barr will restrict the ability of migrants to claim asylum based on their family relations.

In a precedent-setting immigration court opinion, Barr said that simply being part of a nuclear family targeted for persecution doesn’t qualify as a “particular social group” eligible for asylum in the United States.

Story Continued Below

“The fact that a criminal group — such as a drug cartel, gang, or guerrilla force — targets a group of people does not, standing alone, transform those people into a particular social group,” the attorney general wrote.

President Donald Trump has sought to restrict access to asylum, which his administration views as a magnet that draws migrants north from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. Former Attorney General Jeff Sessionsissued a similar immigration court decision in June 2018 that blocked asylum for victims of domestic violence and gang violence, a move that drew condemnation from pro-migrant advocates. A federal judge based in Washington, D.C., blocked key parts of a policy related to the decision six months later.

Barr’s ruling will guide future decisions in the immigration courts, which are not part of the federal judiciary and fall under the purview of the Justice Department. Barr highlighted that authority in the ruling Monday, saying “the attorney general has primary responsibility for construing and applying provisions in the immigration laws.”

To receive asylum in the U.S., applicants must prove they faced persecution in their home countries based on race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership in a particular social group.

Barr’s decision Monday will limit the ability of a familial relationship to qualify as “membership in a particular social group.“ The number of asylum seekers who could be affected each year was not immediately clear.

The attorney general issued the decision in a case that involved a deported Mexican immigrant who claimed drug cartel members had targeted him because they wanted to sell drugs in his father’s Mexico City store.

The Board of Immigration Appeals found that the man’s relationship with his father qualified as a “particular social group,” but ultimately denied the asylum request because the man could not prove he was persecuted over the relationship.

Barr found that being part of a family meets the standard for asylum only when the family is “socially distinct in the eyes of its society.”

Immigration law advocates said the decision defied the precedents of at least two federal appeals courts, which have held that targeting based on family membership can qualify an immigrant for asylum.

“The family provides ‘a prototypical example of a particular social group,’” the Richmond-based 4th Circuitwrote in 2011, quoting an earlier case from the San Francisco-based 9th Circuit.

“It's a significant declaration of power from the A.G. and one that will hopefully take a beating in court,” Aaron Reichlin-Melnick of the American Immigration Council said on Twitter.

The DOJ asylum move is only the latest policy change to limit asylum.

Trump announced Friday that his administration had struck a deal with Guatemala that would require asylum seekers passing through that nation to first seek protections there.

The asylum agreement came after a San Francisco-based federal judge temporarily blocked a Trump regulation that barred asylum seekers who passed through other nations en route to the southwest border.

Acting DHS boss McAleenan praises Supreme Court 'victory' sanctioning use of Pentagon funds for border wall,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Frank Miles', 'Frank Miles Is A Reporter', 'Editor Covering Geopolitics', 'Military', 'Crime', 'Technology', 'Sports For Foxnews.Com. His Email Is Frank.Miles Foxnews.Com.']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/kevin-mcaleenan-dhs-supreme-court-victory-pentagon-funds-border-wall,"Kevin McAleenan, the acting Homeland Security secretary, told Fox News on Sunday it's a “big victory” that the Supreme Court cleared the way for the Trump administration to tap billions of dollars in Pentagon funds to build sections of a border wall with Mexico.

“There was a big victory at the Supreme Court to allow the Department of Defense to move forward with that $2.5 billion to really accelerate the progress on the wall, and kind of double what we're doing with the congressionally appropriated funding, which is going well, as you noted up to 54 miles since we talked,” he told Maria Bartiromo on “Sunday Morning Futures.”

The court’s five conservative justices gave the administration the green light on Friday to begin work on four contracts it has awarded using Defense Department money. Lower courts had frozen funding for the projects while a lawsuit over the money proceeded. The court’s four liberal justices wouldn’t have allowed construction to start.

The Supreme Court’s action reversed the decision of a trial court, which initially froze the funds in May, and an appeals court, which kept that freeze in place earlier this month. The freeze had prevented the government from tapping approximately $2.5 billion in Pentagon money to replace existing sections of barrier in Arizona, California and New Mexico with more robust fencing.

The case in which the Supreme Court ruled began after the 35-day partial government shutdown that started in December of last year. The shutdown ended in February after Congress approved approximately $1.4 billion in border wall funding, but the amount was far less than the $5.7 billion Presiden Trump was seeking. The president then declared a national emergency to take cash from other government accounts to use to construct sections of wall.

KIDNAPPED AUSTRIAN TRIATHLETE SWEET-TALKS CAPTOR INTO LETTING HER GO: REPORT

The money Trump identified included $3.6 billion from military construction funds, $2.5 billion in Defense Department money and $600 million from the Treasury Department’s asset forfeiture fund.

The case before the Supreme Court involved just the $2.5 billion in Defense Department funds, which the administration said would be used to build more than 100 miles of fencing.

One project would replace 46 miles of barrier in New Mexico for $789 million. Another would replace 63 miles in Arizona for $646 million. The other two projects in California and Arizona were smaller.

The other funds were not at issue in the case. The Treasury Department funds so far have survived legal challenges, and Customs and Border Protection has earmarked the money for work in Texas’ Rio Grande Valley but has not yet awarded contracts. Transfer of the $3.6 billion in military construction funds was awaiting approval from the defense secretary.

McAleenan told Bartiromo that “building every day down there in the border … that's already providing significant new operational capability, and helping us control some high traffic areas of the border.”

He said that he did believe the situation at the border has been improving by “almost every measure,” but the only way to eradicate the immigration crisis completely would be through congressional action.

Papadopoulos wants DOJ to examine $10K given to him by CIA or FBI,https://nypost.com,['July'],07-28-2019,2019,7,https://nypost.com/2019/07/28/papadopoulos-wants-doj-to-examine-10k-given-to-him-by-cia-or-fbi/,"Former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos on Sunday said he is returning to Greece to get $10,000 given to him as part of a CIA or FBI setup to entrap him – and he now wants the Department of Justice to examine the cash.

Papadopoulos said he was given the money in Israel during the summer of 2017 from a guy he believes was a spy but turned the moolah over to his attorney for safekeeping in Greece.

“A man named Charles Tawil gave me this money under very suspicious circumstances. A simple Google search about this individual will reveal he was a CIA or State Department asset in South Africa during the ’90s and 2000s. I think around the time when Bob Mueller was the director of the FBI,” he told “Sunday Morning Futures” on Fox News.

Papadopoulos, who served 12 days in federal prison for lying to investigators about contacts with Russian-connected officials during the 2016 campaign, said he has a theory about why he was given the cash.

“The money, I gave it to my attorney in Greece because I felt it was given to me under very suspicious circumstances. And upon coming back to the United States I had about seven or eight FBI agents rummaging through my luggage looking for money,” he told Mario Bartiromo.

He believes it was part of a setup by the FBI or the special counsel Robert Mueller’s office to “bring a [Foreign Agent Registration Act] violation against me.”

He wants Attorney General William Barr and DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz to take a close look at the paper trail.

“Because I still have the bills and I think they are marked,” Papadopoulos said. “These bills that are still in Athens right now must be examined by the investigators because I think they are marked and they’re going to go all the way back to DOJ, under the previous FBI under Comey, and even the Mueller team.”

“If the Mueller team is going around entrapping campaign associates and Trump associates, the way they did to me — I am sure it wasn’t just me they did it to — it’s going to open up a massive can of worms,” he added.

Papadopoulos met with Joseph Misfud, a Maltese professor in London in early 2016 in London.

Misfud told him months before the Wikileaks published Hillary Clinton and Democratic National Committee emails that the Russians had dirt on the Democratic candidates.

Papadopoulos told Australian diplomat John Downer about Misfud’s assertions, and Downer forwarded the information to the FBI."
Former public defender: DOJ plan to resume federal executions a 'recipe for problems',https://thehill.com,[],07-29-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/hilltv/rising/455140-former-public-defender-trumps-plan-to-resume-federal-executions-is-recipe-for-problems,"Former public defender Robert Dunham on Monday said that the Trump administration’s plan to resume federal executions after nearly two decades is a “recipe for problems,” saying that such a move could catch some authorities unprepared if anything goes wrong.

“What we’ve seen is that there’s been 15 years of no executions,” Dunham, now the executive director of the nonprofit Death Penalty Information Center, said in an appearance on Hill.TV.

“Now you’re going to carry out five executions in the span of five weeks, three executions in the span of five days with personnel that have not carried out any executions at all,” he continued. “That particular compressed schedule if it goes forward is a recipe for problems.”

Dunham explained that federal authorities carrying out the executions need to be properly trained.

“These are going to be the first executions, so you know they’re going to be legal challenges — they frequently go on until the last minute and so you’ve got potentially unprepared personnel facing a situation that none of them has faced in a period of 15 years,” he told Hill.TV.

The Justice Department announced last week that it plans to reinstate the federal death penalty, beginning with the executions of death-row inmates later this year. All five of the inmates that Attorney General William Barr William Pelham BarrFormer public defender: DOJ plan to resume federal executions a 'recipe for problems' The death penalty is racially biased, fiscally irresponsible and very inaccurate Trump starts another day with Cummings attack: '25 years of all talk, no action!' MORE named in his release were convicted for the murders of children.

“The Justice Department upholds the rule of law — and we owe it to the victims and their families to carry forward the sentence imposed by our justice system,” Barr’s statement read in part.

Dunham, meanwhile, cast doubt over whether the executions, which are scheduled for December 2019 and January 2020, will actually move forward.

“In the statement last week, Attorney General Barr said he was directing the bureau of prisons to adopt a new protocol, which is going to be a single drug — pentobarbital — the same drug that’s used in Texas and Georgia and Missouri,” he said.

“But the difficulty as a legal matter is you can’t say this is our new protocol, you have to go through the rule-making process,” he added.

Dunham said this compressed system doesn’t allow for “meaningful consideration” for ensuring whether the drugs were obtained legally by a drug company with the appropriate health and safety records.

“If you’re going to have a death penalty — the ultimate in the law — I think it’s critical that we follow the law,” he told Hill.TV.

Barr's announcement comes as the number of executions in the U.S. has declined over the last decade.

According to a report by the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics, the number of death-row inmates had fallen for the 17th consecutive year in 2017.

It also comes amid concerns about whether capital punishment disproportionately impacts African Americans. Dunham said there is still a disproportionate number of people of color who are on death rows around the country, saying this discrimination generally happens in two stages.

“The first is who gets capitally prosecuted — what kind of case and there we see a ‘victim preference if you will’ and that’s where you get the argument that black lives don’t matter because you are much more likely to be capitally prosecuted if you’ve committed an offense against a white person and particularly against a white woman.”

"For Two Weeks, Soybean Crop Shows No Progress, USDA Says",https://www.agriculture.com,[],07-29-2019,2019,7,https://www.agriculture.com/news/crops/for-two-weeks-soybean-crop-shows-no-progress-usda-says,"DES MOINES, Iowa -- The U.S. corn and soybean crops conditions barely changed from a week ago, according to the USDA’s weekly Crop Progress Report released Monday.

The data came in about the same as the trade expected.

Corn

In 2019, the U.S. farmers planted 91.7 million acres of corn, according to the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS). That equates to roughly 69 million football fields of corn and 3% above last year's acreage, according to NASS estimates.

The overall condition of the corn crop is rated at 58% good to excellent in the top 18 corn producing states, compared to 57% a week ago.

The USDA pegged 58% of the corn crop was in the silk stage, compared with a 83% five-year average.

Also, 13% of the corn has entered the dough stage vs. a 23% five-year average.



Soybeans

The nation’s crop is rated 54% good/excellent, equal to a week ago.

Also, 57% of the soybean crop is blooming vs. a 79% five-year average.

The USDA pegged the amount of soybeans setting pods at 21%, well below a five-year average of 45%.



Wheat

The U.S. winter wheat harvest is 75% complete vs. a 79% five-year average.

Meanwhile, the U.S. spring wheat crop is rated as 76% good to excellent, equal to last week’s rating."

The $100 million civil suit, which the Department of Justice filed in the Northern District of California, targets BTC-e for offering services to US residents without abiding by US financial regulations, including declining to register with FinCEN as a Money Services Business, failing to establish anti-money laundering procedures as stipulated under the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), and failing to report suspicious activities.

From the complaint:

“At no point in time did BTC-e have any AML policies or procedures, let alone an effective program for detecting and preventing suspicious transactions. To the contrary, BTC-e’s lax policies encouraged persons engaged in criminal activity to use its services, and BTC-e became the virtual currency exchange of choice for criminals looking to launder their illegal proceeds.”

FinCEN had levied $88.6 million in penalties against BTC-e and $12 million in penalties against Vinnik, and the DOJ says that the lawsuit intends to “enforce” those fines.

The sources also said the review is taking a closer look at the actual start date of the original FBI investigation into potential collusion between members of the Trump campaign and the Russians, as some allege the probe began earlier than thought. Both components are considered key in the review currently being led by Attorney General Bill Barr and U.S. Attorney from Connecticut John Durham -- an effort sure to draw more attention in the coming weeks and months now that Robert Mueller's testimony is in the rearview.

REPUBLICANS CONFRONT MUELLER WITH ALLEGATIONS OF DOUBLE STANDARD IN RUSSIA PROBE

The recordings in question pertain to conversations between government sources and Papadopoulos, which were memorialized in transcripts. One source told Fox News that Barr and Durham are reviewing why the material was left out of applications to surveil another former Trump campaign aide, Carter Page.

“I think it’s the smoking gun,” the source said.

“These recordings have exculpatory evidence,” the other source added. “It is standard tradecraft to record conversations with someone like Papadopoulos—especially when they are overseas and there are no restrictions.”

Prior to the 2016 presidential election, Papadopoulos met with Maltese professor Joseph Mifsud in London, who told him that the Russians had dirt in the form of emails that could damage Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign. Papadopoulos then told Australian diplomat Alexander Downer of the new information. Downer reported Papadopoulos’ comments to him to the FBI.

A source told Fox News that the ""exculpatory evidence"" included in the transcripts is Papadopoulos denying having any contact with the Russians to obtain the supposed ""dirt"" on Clinton.

But Papadopoulos did not only meet with Mifsud and Downer while overseas. He met with Cambridge professor and longtime FBI informant Stefan Halper and his female associate, who went under the alias Azra Turk. Papadopoulos told Fox News that he saw Turk three times in London: once over drinks, once over dinner and once with Halper. He also told Fox News back in May that he always suspected he was being recorded. Further, he tweeted during the Mueller testimony about ""recordings"" of his meeting with Downer.

It is unclear, at this point, which of these individuals may have recorded conversations with Papadopoulos.

Former Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., now a Fox News contributor, first signaled the existence of transcripts of secretly recorded conversations between FBI informants and Papadopoulos earlier this year.

“If the bureau’s going to send in an informant, the informant’s going to be wired, and if the bureau is monitoring telephone calls, there’s going to be a transcript of that,” Gowdy said in May on Fox News' “Sunday Morning Futures,” acknowledging he was aware of the files and suggesting they included exculpatory information.

TREY GOWDY: SECRET FBI TRANSCRIPTS FROM RUSSIA PROBE COULD BE 'GAME-CHANGER'

“Some of us have been fortunate enough to know whether or not those transcripts exist. But they haven’t been made public, and I think one, in particular ... has the potential to actually persuade people,"" he continued. “Very little in this Russia probe I’m afraid is going to persuade people who hate Trump or love Trump. But there is some information in these transcripts that has the potential to be a game-changer if it’s ever made public.”

The transcripts are currently classified, according to sources, but under President Trump’s move in May to approve declassification of documents related to the surveillance of his campaign during the 2016 election, Barr will likely have access to those documents in a declassified format.

A source told Fox News that without the declassification order signed by Trump, Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats was not going to give anyone access to the files—over concerns for protecting sources and methods. But another source told Fox News in May that Coats, along with CIA Director Gina Haspel and FBI Director Chris Wray, are all working “collaboratively” with Barr and Durham on the review.

Barr and Durham are also trying to pinpoint the actual “start date” of the investigation, according to a source.

It has been widely reported, at this point, that the investigation was officially opened by former FBI senior counterintelligence agent Peter Strzok on July 31, 2016, after Downer shared the information that Papadopoulos was told the Russians had “dirt” on Clinton. But some suggest the probe began before that date.

On Wednesday, House Intelligence Committee Ranking Member Devin Nunes, R-Calif., challenged former Special Counsel Mueller over when the investigation started.

""The FBI claims the counterintelligence investigation of the Trump campaign began on July 31, 2016, but in fact, it began before that,"" Nunes said. ""In June 2016, before the investigation was officially opened, Trump campaign associates Carter Page and Stephen Miller were invited to attend a symposium at Cambridge University in July 2016. Your office, however, did not investigate who was responsible for inviting these Trump associates to the symposium.""

Mueller replied: ""Those areas...I'm going to stay away from.""

Meanwhile, Papadopoulos said that in May 2016, he was approached by two U.S. military officials based in the U.S. Embassy in London—Gregory Baker and Terrence Dudley. He told Fox News they were questioning him about his ties in the Middle East and Trump's relationship with Russia.

“Both wanted to ingratiate themselves in campaign via myself,” Papadopoulos tweeted last year.

It is unclear at this point what, if any, involvement Baker and Dudley had in collecting intelligence related to the Trump campaign. Both Baker and Dudley disputed Papadopoulos’ tweet, and reportedly said they reached out to him out of curiosity.

The president, his surrogates and Republicans on Capitol Hill since the start of the Mueller investigation have called for a separate probe into the Russia investigation's beginnings. Barr earlier this year assigned Durham to probe “all intelligence collection activities” related to the Trump campaign during the 2016 presidential election.

The Barr-Durham review is likely to draw more attention following Mueller’s highly anticipated testimony on Capitol Hill. Republicans sought to focus their questioning on the origins of the Russia investigation under then-Director James Comey's FBI—a topic Mueller repeatedly said was “out of his purview” due to the ongoing investigation being led by the Justice Department. Another review is being conducted by the DOJ inspector general.

“Maybe a better course of action is to figure out how the false accusations started,” Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, said Wednesday. “Here’s the good news—that’s exactly what Bill Barr is doing and thank goodness for that.”"
How can $2 million in U.S. EPA Trash-Free grants curb the Great Lakes plastic problem?,https://www.cleveland.com,"['Laura Johnston', 'Ljohnston Cleveland.Com']",07-29-2019,2019,7,https://www.cleveland.com/news/2019/07/how-can-2-million-in-us-epa-trash-free-grants-curb-the-great-lakes-plastic-problem.html,"CLEVELAND, Ohio – How can $2 million in U.S. EPA grants clean up the plastic-plagued Great Lakes?

Local environmental groups – including Surfrider, Alliance for the Great Lakes and Drink Local. Drink Tap – are interested in applying for grants, announced this month as part of the annual $300 million Great Lakes Restoration Initiative.

But some experts say the money will do little to solve the problem of 22 million pounds of plastic dumped into the Great Lakes each year.

The only real solution is to stop making more plastic, said Sherri A. Mason, sustainability coordinator at Penn State University’s Behrend campus.

“It’s money and I appreciate money being put toward anything,” Mason said. “If you really want to solve this problem, you don’t focus on removing the trash... That’s a Band-aid on a gaping wound when really what we need are stitches.”

The EPA plans to release details in October. A spokeswoman said the cleanup and preventing of all marine and shoreline trash will be eligible for grants up to $500,000 and that plastics will likely be an important component of many applications.

“This first-of-its-kind trash-focused grant program is yet another example of progress being made under the GLRI,” said EPA Region 5 Administrator Cathy Stepp. “Thanks to this funding, a number of Great Lakes communities can receive a meaningful assist in removing trash and litter from beaches, shorelines and waterways where cleanup projects are sorely needed.”

Erin Huber, director of Drink Local. Drink Tap, hopes the grants reward efforts to “stop creating the trash in the first place.”

Since 2010, Drink Local volunteers have picked up 6,681 pounds of trash from Cleveland beaches.

“Clean ups, though we do them, are a last resort,” Huber said. “I worry that this grant might be a shiny thing to take our attention away from real issues - unsustainable consumption, unsustainable plastic (aka fossil fuel) use.”

How big is the problem?

Lake Erie has 46,000 pieces of plastic per square kilometer, rivaling the dirtiest part of the world’s oceans, Mason said in the 2018 State of the Great Lakes speech at the City Club of Cleveland.

The earth adds about 300 million tons of plastic every year.

Nearly half of it is packaging.

About 10 percent is recycled -- a number that won’t likely increase since plastic is so cheap to manufacture.

About 10 percent ends up in waterways.

Much of it -- including fast-food straws, cigar tips and plastic bottle caps -- comes flushed from city streets throughout the watershed, down storm drains and into the lake, according to a Rochester Institute of Technology study. The trash washes up on shore, making up about 80 percent of the litter on beaches.

Winds and currents usually push the trash to the east and southern shores of each Great Lake.

In 2018, more than 14,300 volunteers worked with the Alliance for the Great Lakes at 900 beach clean ups, over all five Great Lakes, collecting 35,600 pounds of trash. About 87 percent of that trash was plastic.

“We see a litter issue on a lot of beaches,” Alliance spokeswoman Jennifer Caddick said. “It’s going to have to be a bigger solution than just beach clean ups.”

What are people doing already?

Local governments and businesses have taken their own actions.

In May, Cuyahoga County Council voted 8-3 to enact a plastic bag ban, the first in Ohio, in part to keep plastic out of the lake. County Councilwoman Sunny Simon, who pushed for years for the ban, said county residents use 320 million plastic bags each year. The Republican-dominated state legislature, though, may ban the bag ban.

Many Northeast Ohio restaurants have eliminated plastic straws and have switched Styrofoam take-out containers for biodegradable options.

What else could we do?

Grants could pay for all sorts of projects and programs.

Take the invention of Thomas Zung, a distinguished senior fellow at Stanford University, who won Cleveland Water Alliance’s ErieHack competition in June with a geodesic dome that collects trash from storm sewer outflows. A crane then empties and dumps the trash.

Zung and his team of Cleveland college students, won $40,000 for the idea from Erie Hack. He plans to apply for a Trash-Free grant, too.

Tim Hoellein, an assistant professor of biology at Loyola University Chicago, who studies trash in the Great Lakes, plans to apply for a grant to boost his research, which includes analyzing data from Alliance for the Great Lakes clean ups. The number of cigarette butts, one of the top items found on beaches, has dropped over the last 15 years.

“There’s some room for optimism,” Hoellein said. “A suite of public policies can have a positive outcome over the long term.”

Hoellein appreciates the Trump administration’s spotlight on the trash problem. So far, he said, garbage is not a political issue. Everyone, regardless of party, can see it.

(That said, the Trump campaign is selling packs of plastic straws labeled “Make straws great again.” Plastic straws account for about 1 percent of the plastic in the oceans, according to Stanford Center for Ocean Solutions.)

What’s the problem with trash?

Cleaning it up costs cities money. Its ugliness may detour tourism. There are public health concerns with people exposed to diapers, needles or tampons, plus wildlife problems for fish and birds who eat it or get entangled in it.

Hoellein’s team has analyzed 250 fish, 95 percent of which have plastic in their stomach. The plastic may be as small as a microfiber from a fleece jacket that washed off in the laundry. “But it’s almost universally there,” he said.

Lake lovers hope the federal focus on trash will help reverse the trash flow.

Said the Alliance’s Cleveland office outreach coordinator, Destinee Henton: “I applaud the EPA for their commitment to cleaning up our most precious natural resource.”

Daycare Owner’s Son Arrested By Feds In Homeland Security Raid,https://miami.cbslocal.com,[],07-29-2019,2019,7,https://miami.cbslocal.com/2019/07/29/homeland-security-raid-miami-daycare-center/,"SOUTHWEST MIAMI-DADE (CBSMiami) – The son of a Southwest Miami-Dade day care center owner is under arrest, however, his name and the charges have not been released.

The Department of Homeland Security served a warrant around 4:30 a.m. at the Little Seeds Academy Child Care and Learning Center at 10470 Bird Road.

Once inside, cyber agents were looking at computers. H-S-I said computers and telephones were being removed from the home early Monday afternoon. A CBS4 crew captured a computer tower being loaded in to a federal vehicle.

HSI says it can neither confirm nor deny reports that they were looking into whether there was child pornography that had been downloaded onto at least one of the computers in the home.

That is what worried parents heard.

“You see these people every day you just don’t expect these things to happen especially here in a facility where children are,” said parent Zaira Perez. “I have three kids here. I have my baby, a 4-year-old and another who used to go to school here so our main concern is that they are all okay and none are involved in this situation. This is the worst nightmare for any parent.”

Perez told CBS4’S Peter D’Oench “My heart aches for what happened. We just don’t know. These are my little babies. Just to know that that person had contact with the kids. It is disgusting.”

Another parent, Ana Hernandez, said, “We just want to know what happened to our kids. We want to know if any of the pictures on the computers are of our kids. My want to clear up the situation.”

Sophia Ramirez, another parent, was near tears when she said, “How do you take this news? There are no answers at all. I don’t have words for this. You put your trust in people here with the kids.”

Another parent, Mirna Gomez, another parent, said, “My daughter is the last one out of the day care every day and she leaves when the man who was arrested is there. She was there when no one else was there and I worry about her being in contact with him.”

Gomez also said he had spoken with the daughter of the owner and said, “She said these allegations are not true, what’s being reported. She said it only has to do with something personal and not something with the day care.”

Gomez said she was told the daycare was going to voluntarily shut down for a week.

“They’d don’t have to,” said Gomez. “They are going to do this on their own.”

D’Oench also caught up with the daughter of the daycare owner, who was identified as Julietta. She was speaking with the concerned parents.

“What are you telling them about the day care?” Julietta was asked.

“I am telling them that I am like them, that I just don’t know what is going on,” he said.

“Are you telling them if they were impacted?” Julietta was asked.

“They haven’t been,” she said. “This was just something to do with computers and something personal and not the day care.”

DCF, the Department of Children and Families, is investigating.

A neighbor named Carmen is also concerned.

“They should be arrested and put in jail for the rest of their life. I have kids and I’m against child pornography all kinds, but when it’s about children I’m 100% against it. ”

Another neighbor, Yulio Lledias, said “I am sorry about this. This is so close to home. This is really bad. I mean I have a 7 year old daughter.”

Homeland Security says the man taken into custody Monday is expected to appear in federal magistrate’s court Tuesday."
New timeline emerges for DOJ inspector general report on FISA abuse,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-27-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/new-timeline-emerges-for-doj-inspector-general-report-on-fisa-abuse,"A new timeline has emerged in recent days for Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz's investigation into alleged surveillance abuses by the DOJ and the FBI.

Whereas Attorney General William Barr predicted earlier this year that the watchdog's investigation would be finished by May or early June, now lawmakers are pointing to the early fall.

Rep. Doug Collins, the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, told Maria Bartiromo on Fox News' Sunday Morning Futures that he “expects that report later this fall.”

His colleague John Ratcliffe, who has spoken to Horowitz, gave a more specific target. The Texas congressman told Fox News' Bret Baier on Wednesday, ""I think that we will get the IG's report probably sometime right after Labor Day."" Labor Day is Sept. 2.

Further solidifying the prediction was a RealClearInvestigations report about former FBI Director James Comey having an inside man at the White House, feeding the bureau information about President Trump and his aides in 2017. That report also set a release date sometime in September.

The delay in Horowitz's work was reportedly due to his team's two-day meeting with Steele in person in London in early June, during President Trump’s state visit to the United Kingdom. Investigators found Steele's information credible enough to warrant extending their investigation.

Horowitz launched an investigation in March 2018 into whether the FBI and the Justice Department filing of four Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act applications and renewals beginning in October 2016 to surveil former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page was an abuse of the FISA process. The applications relied heavily upon the unverified dossier compiled by Steele, who was hired by Fusion GPS. The opposition research firm was hired by Marc Elias of the Perkins Coie law firm at the behest of the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign. Steele's Democratic benefactors were not revealed to the FISA Court.

Meanwhile Barr's ""investigation into the investigators"" is underway, and the attorney general has said he is working very closely with Horowitz. The inspector general can recommend prosecutions, and U.S. Attorney John Durham, whom Barr tasked to lead the review, has the ability to convene a grand jury and subpoena people outside of the government. Beyond that, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, a close Trump ally, has promised a ""deep dive"" into the origins of the Trump-Russia investigation after Horowitz completes his work.

Stay tuned to the Washington Examiner this weekend for closer look at what to expect from Horowitz's report."
DOJ approves T-Mobile-Sprint deal with conditions,https://www.axios.com,[],07-26-2019,2019,7,https://www.axios.com/doj-approves-t-mobile-sprint-deal-with-conditions-5025138d-4f25-4103-82ef-8e6ce0dce21a.html,"The Justice Department and five states reached the settlement with Sprint and T-Mobile, which calls on the companies to:

Sell Sprint's prepaid brands (Boost, Virgin and Sprint Prepaid) to Dish Network.

Make available at least 20,000 cell sites to Dish

Divest some spectrum in the 800MHz range to Dish

Provide Dish with ""robust access"" to the T-Mobile network for at least 7 years while Dish builds out its 5G network

engage in ""good faith"" negotiations about leasing some of Dish's existing 600MHz spectrum

Yes, but: Dish already has been sitting on a bunch of spectrum that it has yet to use and many wireless industry experts doubt its ability to emerge as a serious fourth player in the market.

What they're saying:

Assistant Attorney General Makin Delrahim said that the merger ""would be anti-competitive” if not for the remedies the agency includes in its settlement.

Former FCC official Gigi Sohn: ""The state AGs who sued to block the merger shouldn’t be fooled by this weak attempt to maintain competition in the mobile wireless market.... A new mobile wireless entrant that starts with zero postpaid subscribers and that must rely on its much bigger rival, the new T-Mobile, just to operate is not a competitor. It's a mobile Frankenstein.""

T-Mobile CEO John Legere noted in a statement that the Dish deal won't change ""previously announced target synergies, profitability and long-term cash generation"" projections.

Dish Chairman Charlie Ergen said the deal will help fulfill two decades of work and more than $21 billion in spectrum investments. Dish also notes in a press release that the deal requires it to ""use its spectrum to deploy a nationwide 5G broadband network covering at least 70 percent of the U.S. population by June 14, 2023"" or else ""make voluntary contributions to the U.S. Treasury of up to $2.2 billion.”

What's next: A court will have to approve the deal, and 10 other states have separately sued to block it. Those states have asked the court for more time in the event of a DoJ settlement that changed the terms of the deal, as is now the case."
Textile Waste Has Surged 811% Since the '60s According to the EPA,https://www.highsnobiety.com,"['Isabelle Hore-Thorburn', 'Weekend Staff Writer']",07-29-2019,2019,7,https://www.highsnobiety.com/p/textile-waste-increase-epa-report/,"According to data from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), textile waste has increased by 811 percent between 1960 and 2015. The majority of this waste is made up of municipal solid waste (MSW). MSW encompasses discarded clothing, as well as small furniture, carpets, tires, and footwear.

The EPA calculated that in 2015, clothing and footwear produced 11.9 million tons of waste and 4.5 percent of total MSW. Decades of data gathering evidence a dramatic increase in textile waste, which grew from 1.76 million tons in 1960 to more than 16 million tons in 2015.

Jackie King, executive director of Secondary Materials and Recycled Textiles (SMART), told Supply Chain Dive that the problem has worsened significantly in the last decade. She explained that “a lot of the ‘fast fashion’ clothing is not very well made and might not last through more than a few washes before ending up in the landfill.”

Attorney General William Barr orders first federal executions in nearly two decades,https://www.cnbc.com,['Tucker Higgins'],07-25-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/25/william-barr-orders-first-federal-executions-in-nearly-two-decades.html,"The federal government will resume executing death row inmates after nearly two decades without doing so, the Department of Justice announced Thursday.

Attorney General William Barr directed the Bureau of Prisons to schedule the executions of five inmates convicted of murder and other crimes. The executions have been scheduled for December 2019 and January 2020.

The department also announced a new execution protocol, replacing the three-drug cocktail previously used in federal executions with the single drug, pentobarbital.

The last federal execution was carried out in 2003. There are 62 individuals on federal death row, according to a tracker maintained by the Death Penalty Information Center.

The Supreme Court outlawed state and federal death penalty laws in the 1972 decision Furman v. Georgia. The ruling invalidated the laws then on the books, but did not outlaw the death penalty under all circumstances, leading states and the federal government to draft new legislation.

The federal death penalty was reinstated in 1988, and expanded by Congress in 1994. No federal executions took place, however, until 2001, according to to the Bureau of Prisons website.

""Congress has expressly authorized the death penalty through legislation adopted by the people's representatives in both houses of Congress and signed by the President,"" Barr said in a statement. ""Under Administrations of both parties, the Department of Justice has sought the death penalty against the worst criminals, including these five murderers, each of whom was convicted by a jury of his peers after a full and fair proceeding."""

CBP processing centers have been scrutinized as migrants, including children, have been held in sub par conditions far longer than the 72-hour limit with reports of abuse and mistreatment.

The senators are asking acting Secretary of Homeland Security Kevin McAleenan and acting Commissioner of CBP, Mark Morgan, to respond to their request by Thursday and provide a telephone briefing by Aug. 10 with an update on if the requests are being addressed.

Among the senators' requests: improve the water quality at the McAllen Border Patrol Station; provide schedules to Congress indicating that migrants can make phone calls, eat, take showers and brush their teeth; darken rooms so children can sleep.

The letter notes that the senators want to know if the migrants can report claims of abuse and what type of medical and psychological care the migrants have access to, and if DHW will support additional independent monitoring of facilities.

Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., is the highest ranking member of Congress to visit the border. He and 12 other Democratic senators visited the Border Patrol processing facility in McAllen, as well as processing centers Donna and Ursula, also in Texas.

""The searing accounts about the conditions endured by migrant families are true. We saw overcrowding. We heard migrants tell us that they were unable to brush their teeth, shower, call their families, or access feminine hygiene products,"" Schumer said on the Senate floor earlier this week. ""We saw children in soiled clothing, caged and expressionless — heartbreaking, thousand-mile stares on the faces of toddlers…where smiles and laughter should have been.""

The letter notes that a July inspector general report instructed DHS to ""take immediate steps to alleviate dangerous overcrowding and prolonged detention of children and adults.""

Aaron Hull, head of the Border Patrol's El Paso Sector, will be reassigned to Detroit on Monday, according to documents obtained by NBC News.

U.S. Satellite Operators Urge Commerce Department to Revise Proposed Commercial Remote Sensing Regulations,https://finance.yahoo.com,[],07-29-2019,2019,7,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-satellite-operators-urge-commerce-090000762.html,"WESTMINSTER, Colo.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--

Proposed regulations would be a step backward for U.S. industry, giving foreign firms a competitive advantage

U.S. satellite operators Maxar Technologies (MAXR) (MAXR.TO), Planet Labs, HawkEye 360, BlackSky Global and Spire Global today urged the U.S. Department of Commerce to revise its proposed commercial remote sensing regulations, which as drafted would put U.S. firms at a significant disadvantage in the global marketplace.

Maxar, Planet, HawkEye 360, BlackSky Global and Spire Global recently submitted a joint response to the Commerce Department’s Notice of Proposed Rulemaking objecting to the newly proposed rules. While U.S. satellite operators appreciate the Department’s recognition of the risk to American leadership in space that comes from overly burdensome regulation, the proposed regulations would undermine U.S. competitiveness, impair U.S. innovation and deter investment in the U.S. commercial space industry. Commenters urged the Commerce Department to significantly revise the proposed regulations to take a more narrowly tailored approach to ensure the pressing need for continued U.S. leadership in commercial space is more appropriately balanced with other regulatory interests.

The U.S. commercial space industry provides critical products and services that support disaster and humanitarian crisis response, national and global security interests and enhance the location-enabled services that billions of people around the world use every day. Addressing the lack of transparency, operational uncertainty and institutionalized delays that impair the ability of the U.S. industry to bring innovative products and services to market should be the primary focus of the Commerce Department’s efforts. For example, license requests to bring new commercial satellite imagery capabilities to market can take years to approve, operators have little visibility into the decision-making process and operating licenses are subject to retroactive modifications after investment has already been made and systems are operating. By failing to address these issues, the proposed regulations put at risk continued U.S. leadership in the global commercial space industry, including the satellite imagery market, which is alone projected to reach $3 billion by 2020.

“The U.S. commercial space industry needs smart regulations that promote innovation, encourage competitiveness and bolster national security, and unfortunately the Commerce Department’s draft regulations fall far short of these goals,” said Dr. Walter Scott, Maxar CTO. “Maxar, Planet, HawkEye 360, BlackSky Global and Spire Global urge U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and the National Space Council to intervene and ensure that new regulations allow American space firms to continue to lead in this dynamic global industry.”

“The draft regulations represent a three-decade step backward,” said Robbie Schingler, Planet’s Co-founder. “This is cold water thrown onto a thriving ecosystem with rapidly changing space architectures, many new entrants and novel business models. We strongly urge regulators to take a strategic view and create a forward-leaning environment that opens up near-Earth space to efficient, secure and trusted commercial enterprise. Building new industries bolsters American competitiveness and grows the economy, which fuels national security. Should this rule progress without significant modification, it will represent a direct threat to 21st century U.S. national security.”

MORE said in a statement Thursday.

“Under Administrations of both parties, the Department of Justice has sought the death penalty against the worst criminals, including these five murderers, each of whom was convicted by a jury of his peers after a full and fair proceeding. The Justice Department upholds the rule of law—and we owe it to the victims and their families to carry forward the sentence imposed by our justice system.”

Several states currently have a moratorium on the death penalty or have suspended the practice due to recent past wrongful convictions brought to light by groups such as the Innocence Project, which have secured the release of a number of death-row inmates in recent years. The total number of executions has declined over the last decade, in part, due to concerns that capital punishment disproportionately affects African Americans.

The death penalty has been abolished in about 70 percent of countries, including many democratic, industrialized nations similar to the U.S."

Treasury pick Monica Crowley spread Obama smears: 'Can he be both loyal to Islam and loyal to the United States?',https://www.cnn.com,"['Andrew Kaczynski', 'Nathan Mcdermott']",07-25-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/25/politics/kfile-monica-crowley/index.html,"(CNN) President Donald Trump's pick for the top spokeswoman job at the Treasury Department repeatedly spread conspiracy theories that suggested then-President Barack Obama was secretly a Muslim who was sympathetic to America's enemies.

Crowley also endorsed a story claiming Obama was an ""Islamic community organizer"" trying to conform the United States to Sharia law and claimed conspiracy theories about Obama's birth certificate were ""legitimate concerns."" During Obama's presidency, Trump was one of the most prominent voices pushing the so-called birther conspiracy theories questioning Obama's birthplace. When he was seeking the presidency himself and under continual questioning, Trump finally admitted that Obama was born in the US but offered no apologies or explanation for the years he spent sowing doubt about Obama's origins.

Crowley, formerly a syndicated radio host, columnist and Fox News contributor, was originally chosen by Trump in December 2016 to be the senior director of strategic communications for the National Security Council. She withdrew herself from consideration for that position after CNN's KFile team uncovered extensive plagiarism in her book and doctoral thesis.

Crowley did not respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson for the Treasury Department also did not respond to a request for comment.

Suggested Obama was a Muslim

Writing on her blog in August 2010 , Crowley blasted Obama for supporting the right to build an Islamic community center and mosque in lower Manhattan. Some conservatives seized on the issue making it a flash-point and objecting to, at times using highly inflammatory rhetoric, building a mosque so close to the site of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.

Crowley wrote that Obama had loyalties to Islam and questioned if he could support both Islam and the United States.

""Maybe politics didn't have anything to do with it, but Islam certainly did. And does. Obama was born to a Muslim father, which under Islam automatically made him a Muslim. He says he converted to Christianity as an adult, which under Islam makes him an apostate,"" wrote Crowley. ""He grew up in Indonesia, which is the most populous Muslim nation on earth. His stepfather was also a Muslim. He was steeped in Islam throughout his formative years, so it should come as no surprise that he has loyalties to Islam. During the 2008 campaign, he even slipped and claimed that the United States has '57' states, instead of 50. The number of Muslim states in the Organization of the Islamic Conference is 57.""

""It may not come as a shock that he appears loyal to Islam. The question is: can he be both loyal to Islam and loyal to the United States?"" she added.

Crowley added, ""How could he....support the enemy?""

Called birther conspiracy theories legitimate

Writing in a blog post in April 2011 after the release of Obama's long-form birth certificate, Crowley praised Donald Trump for questioning Obama's citizenship and called concerns about the birth certificate legitimate.

""If the birth certificate were never a big deal, why did No Drama Obama wait nearly 3 years before releasing it? Why endure and stoke all of the drama? To make those raising legitimate concerns about his origins and policies look like kooks? Maybe,"" wrote Crowley.

""For over 2 1/2 years, questions have been raised about Obama's origins and background,"" she added. ""He was never properly vetted by an adoring press corps, so outstanding concerns existed about his birth certificate (the long-form of which he had never released), where he grew up, his family's religious background, his parents' political beliefs, how he got into top schools such as Columbia and Harvard Law, how he paid for his education, what his grades were, etc. The questions were and are legitimate, and yet were never fully answered. In fact, anyone daring to ask them was painted as a fringe moron at best and racist at worst.""

In 2011, Hawaiian officials, at Obama's request, released the long form of his birth certificate. It indicated that he had, indeed, been born in Hawaii. Conspiracy theorists continue to allege the document was a forgery.

Said Obama was on the side of terrorists

Writing a bout the Obama administration in June 2013 , Crowley said it looked the Muslim Brotherhood was dictating American foreign policy.

""The Muslim Brotherhood is a sworn enemy of the United States. In Obama, they have found an ally. What does that say about Obama? I'm sure you can figure that one out,"" she wrote. ""What it says about America's national security is that it looks increasingly like it's being dictated BY that sworn enemy.""

Writing in a January 2009 blog post, Crowley singled out Obama for using his full name at his swearing in (presidents typically are sworn in using their full names) and decisions related to banning the use of torture and closing of the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, detention center as actions that raised questions about the president's sympathies.

""Barack Obama insisted on being sworn in as president with his full name, Barack Hussein Obama. One of his very first things he did as president was to order the closure of the terrorist detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba,"" she wrote, without noting that Obama had campaigned on this issue, the facility had been a top concern for human rights defenders. ""The two things he did along with that was to order a halt to the prosecutions of terrorist suspects there, including the mastermind of the September 11th attacks, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, and other top al Qaeda terrorists, like Ramzi Binalshibh. He also issued an order against the use of enhanced interrogation tactics on such terrorists, including waterboarding.

""Now comes word that he is granting his first formal television interview as president to Al-Arabiya,"" she added. ""Tells you where his head is, and possibly, his sympathies. Just sayin'.""

""The administration, with Obama as Islamic community organizer, is not only placating Muslims and, in particular, our Islamic enemies; it is conforming US policy to Islam and Sharia,"" reads the column.

""Obama's actions may, however, actually betray a more nefarious strategy: do as little as politically possible so as to foment chaos across the region, all to the benefit of his seeming policy ""companions"" dedicated to promoting Sharia and Islamic statehood- the Muslim Brotherhood and the Islamic Republic of Iran- while defanging the US's best ally in the region, Israel. Despite public pressure, resist confronting ISIS/ISIL and Bashar Assad in any truly meaningful way and turn his back on the Christian genocide exploding across the region. In addition, flood the US with Muslim immigrants while keeping it bound to foreign oil despite remarkable innovations at home that can render it virtually energy independent."""
DOJ’s tech probe needs to be mindful of corporate harassment,https://nypost.com,"['Jonathon Trugman', 'July']",07-28-2019,2019,7,https://nypost.com/2019/07/28/dojs-tech-probe-needs-to-be-mindful-of-corporate-harassment/,"The Department of Justice last week launched a wide-ranging antitrust review to determine if the largest technology companies are, or have been, stifling competition.

The four that are reported to be most focused on — Facebook, Amazon, Apple and Google — account for almost a million high-paying jobs with good benefits, and are massive contributors to this year’s strong projected 2.5 percent-plus GDP growth rate.

Facebook, Google, Amazon and Snap all reported earnings last week. Aside from Amazon’s — affected by a big investment in faster delivery — they were pretty impressive. (Apple reports this week.) So people clearly are using these platforms to conduct commerce and communication.

There are always unintended consequences of big government trying to wrestle with an industry. The DOJ needs to be mindful of that, and not return to the Obama days of excess corporate harassment.

While the privacy issues are real and absolutely need to continue to be addressed, the anticompetitive aspect seems to me rather nonsensical.

Silicon Valley’s growth machine is one of the bright lights of the economy, not only in the US, but globally.

So I like the way the FTC handled the Facebook settlement announced on Wednesday. Facebook agreed to pay a $5 billion penalty due to the privacy issues and the use of people’s data, as happened in the Cambridge Analytica fiasco.

Those who say that’s not enough money don’t get it. It’s not about the money, it’s about the behavior. The FTC, by requiring Zuckerberg’s certification that its newly-agreed-to privacy rules are adhered to, found a great way to truly address any issues going forward without inhibiting growth and innovation.

These companies don’t stifle competition; they finance and foster it!

Let’s not give China or any other advanced economies a technological advantage by hampering our own geniuses and shooting ourselves in the foot."

The full House vote came after the House Oversight and Reform Committee subpoenaed the Commerce and Justice departments earlier this year for documents relating to since-abandoned efforts to put a citizenship question on the 2020 census.

The matter was challenged in several federal courts, and the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 last month that the question couldn’t be added to the census under the administration's rationale that it would help to enforce the Voting Rights Act, reasoning the high court called ""contrived.""

While Trump initially signaled that he would still try to get the question on next year’s census, he ultimately gave up the effort. He instead announced an executive order directing federal agencies to provide information on citizenship to the Commerce Department."
Haaland pushes EPA for a national recycling strategy,https://www.abqjournal.com,"['Scott Turner', 'Journal Staff Writer']",,,,https://www.abqjournal.com/1346154/haaland-pushes-epa-for-a-national-recycling-strategy.html,".......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... ..........

Copyright © 2019 Albuquerque Journal

U.S. Rep. Deb Haaland is among several lawmakers on Capitol Hill requesting the Environmental Protection Agency develop a national recycling strategy in response to a change in policy in China that has sharply reduced the import of foreign scrap materials, which they said has created a crisis for local recycling programs.

The New Mexico Democrat and other members of Congress sent EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler a letter earlier this month asking if the agency is developing a strategy to address the needs of municipalities where recycled items have been piling up that were once shipped overseas.

ADVERTISEMENTSkip

................................................................

“This change in policy, and after three decades of reliance on China to accept American domestic recyclables, has created a crisis for states and municipalities across the country,” the letter said.

The lawmakers told Wheeler the U.S. lacked the infrastructure to meet current needs.

“Our reliance on China and the lack of local investment has resulted in the rapid decline of recycling programs across the country, with recyclable waste piling up in U.S. landfills, or worse yet, being incinerated and releasing harmful chemicals into the environment,” they said.

China’s decision to reduce the amount of recycled items it took in has caused the cost of running recycling programs in Albuquerque and Santa Fe to rise, according to a Journal story earlier this year. Both cities saw a rise in programs costing a few hundred thousands of dollars a year to $1 million or more in the past couple of years.

“Albuquerque is taking the lead and implementing recycling programs and finding effective workarounds for this challenge, but recycling programs across the country are struggling,” Haaland told the Journal. “If we’re going to get serious about empowering our communities to reduce waste – we need to invest in local recycling infrastructure.”

The lawmakers’ letter to Wheeler said the change in China’s policy presented the U.S. with an opportunity to be a leader in the recycling industry “and stop the wasteful practice of throwing valuable materials away.”

The letter said the EPA reported in 2015 over $9 billion worth of recyclable materials were thrown away each year, and that was before China changed its policy.

It suggested that the EPA was best equipped to assist in developing a national strategy.

“We need a comprehensive solution that focuses on targeted investments in local recycling programs to enhance recycling infrastructures and promotes new technologies for sorting, reusing and converting waste into valuable goods,” the lawmakers said."
US Department of Justice Accuses Crypto Exec of $7 Million Fraud Scheme,https://cointelegraph.com,"['Max Boddy', 'Masao Akimoto']",07-25-2019,2019,7,https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-department-of-justice-accuses-crypto-exec-of-7-million-fraud-scheme,"Federal authorities in the state of New York have unsealed fraud charges against the principal of a purported cryptocurrency escrow company Volantis in the amount of over $7 million.

According to an announcement by the Department of Justice (DoJ), the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York and the Assistant Director-in-Charge of the New York Field Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) unsealed a filing with the allegations on July 25. The defendant, Volantis principal Jon Barry Thompson, was also arrested on the same day.

Thompson allegedly made false representations about Volantis’ purported Bitcoin transaction service in order to fraudulently secure over $7 million from two different companies. In the filing, the complainants say that Thompson offered a service for low-risk crypto settlements by acting as a mutual custodian for two transacting parties.

Defendant allegedly used firm as a front for theft

However, Manhattan U.S. Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman claims that Thompson used this service as a front to steal the “custodied” money:

“Jon Thompson induced investors to engage in cryptocurrency transactions through his company, Volantis Market Making, by touting a transaction structure that would eliminate any risk of loss during the purchase. As his clients soon realized, however, Thompson’s representations were false, and these cryptocurrency investors ultimately lost all of the money they had entrusted with him because of his lies.”

The FBI Assistant Director-in-Charge, William F. Sweeney Jr., further specified that he believes Thompson used confusing jargon to exploit companies less familiar with the crypto space:

“Using phrases and terminology that the victim companies didn't understand, he allegedly preyed on their ignorance of the emerging cryptocurrency. Our job at the FBI is to investigate fraud and follow the money wherever it leads.”

The filing itself was signed on July 18, and contains the specifics of the fraud charges. According to the filing, the defendant is being charged with two counts of commodities fraud as well as two counts of wire fraud.

As previously reported by Cointelegraph, the DoJ indicted an individual on July 24 for failing to register himself or his company with the Secretary of the U.S. Treasury. The defendant, William Green, allegedly ran a fiat-to-Bitcoin (BTC) conversion service on “Destination Bitcoin” out of New Jersey without registering as a money transmission business."

John Ratcliffe: Mueller could not testify about Obama-Russia question because DOJ is investigating,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-25-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/john-ratcliffe-mueller-could-not-testify-about-obama-russia-question-because-doj-is-investigating,"A leading Republican investigator surmised that Robert Mueller was restrained from speaking about whether the Obama administration was influenced by the Russians because of an ongoing Justice Department investigation.

After the former special counsel testified about his Russia investigation Wednesday, Rep. John Ratcliffe told Fox News' Bret Baier that British ex-spy Christopher Steele's dossier was off-limits because U.S. Attorney John Durham and Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz are looking into how it was used by federal agents.

""What we don’t know, what he didn’t answer today was whether or not that’s sweeping and systematic effort influenced the Obama administration,"" the Texas congressman said. ""Did they use a false dossier to surveil an American citizen and thereby influence the election? That was something that Bob Mueller wasn’t willing to address today and I think John Durham and the folks at the Justice Department will be looking into that.""

Baier asked Ratcliffe what his expectation for a timeline regarding Horowitz's investigation on alleged surveillance abuses by the Justice Department and FBI and Durham's inquiry into the origins of the Russia investigation. The congressman, who is on the House Intelligence and Judiciary committees and has spoken to Horowitz, said progress is being made.

""I think that we will get the IG's report probably sometime right after Labor Day. I think John Durham just got started, but I think there’s a lot to look at there. I think there’s a lot that you saw the special counsel wouldn’t answer today because it was in the purview and under the investigation of John Durham as the new special counsel,"" he said.

Labor Day is Sept. 2 this year.

Durham was tasked by Attorney General William Barr, who said he is working closely with Horowitz, to lead a review of the origins of the Russia investigation. Trump also gave Barr “full and complete authority to declassify information” in the Justice Department inquiry.

In his opening statements to the House Judiciary and Intelligence Committees on Wednesday, Mueller said he would not speak about the Steele dossier in his testimony, nor about the FBI's opening of the Russia investigation that preceded his appointment, citing his consultation with the Justice Department about restrictions. At one point, Rep. Matt Gaetz grilled Mueller about Steele's dossier, which contained salacious and unverified claims about Trump's ties to Russia. He also asked about Fusion GPS, the opposition research firm that hired Steele, but the former FBI director dodged by repeatedly asserting it was beyond his purview.

The FBI says the counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign began July 2016 after Australian diplomat Alexander Downer told the U.S. that Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos claimed the Russians had some sort of incriminating evidence against Hillary Clinton, Trump's 2016 presidential rival. This effort was later wrapped into Mueller's investigation.

In spite of this, Trump and congressional Republicans have cited the dossier as evidence that the genesis of the FBI's original investigation into Russia interference in the 2016 election was possibly based on the compromising material from Steele. They have also raised concerned about how the FBI relied on the dossier to obtain Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrants to gather information on former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser Carter Page between October 2016 and June 2017. The dossier was funded by the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign was not revealed to the FISA Court.

Mueller, who was appointed to take over the investigation after the president fired ex-FBI Director James Comey in May 2017, testified that he was not involved in the approval chain for the final FISA renewal."

"EPA targets Bergen, Passaic counties for Passaic River dioxin cleanup. But is it enough?",https://www.northjersey.com,"['Scott Fallon', 'Published A.M. Et July']",07-29-2019,2019,7,https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/environment/2019/07/29/epa-targets-bergen-passaic-counties-massive-passaic-river-cleanup-dioxin-occidental-ypf/1836670001/,"CLOSE EPA officials Michael Sivak, left, and Pete Lopez, right, discuss cleanup plans for the upper nine miles of the contaminated Passaic River. North Jersey Record

Pockets of highly contaminated Passaic River sediment in Bergen and Passaic counties would be partially excavated and capped with a barrier under plans being considered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, officials said.

Cleaning up 9 miles of the Passaic — from North Arlington to the Dundee Dam in Clifton and Garfield — would not be as massive as the still-pending $1.4 billion plan to partially dredge the river's lower 8 miles from bank to bank in Newark and Hudson County.

Instead, contractors are targeting hot spots contaminated with cancer-causing dioxin, PCBs and other industrial pollution that have made the Passaic one of the most polluted waterways in the U.S.

But the EPA's proposal to leave a portion of the pollution under a barrier — a strategy that it has often been used at other contaminated sites — has drawn criticism for both portions of the Passaic cleanup.

""These hot spots need to be totally dredged,"" said David Yennior, a longtime member of a community group that advises the EPA on the Passaic cleanup. ""EPA seems to have an unwritten policy to cap everything and not do a total cleanup.""

Other members of the community group, along with EPA officials and some elected officials, have praised the plan. It is one of the largest, most expensive cleanups in the 40-year history of the federal Superfund program.

The pollution dates to the 1960s, when workers at the former Diamond Alkali plant in Newark routinely dumped dioxin — a byproduct of Agent Orange, the infamous Vietnam-era herbicide — into the adjacent Passaic River.

After decades marked by studies, pushback by polluters and smaller cleanups, the EPA announced a $1.4 billion plan in 2016 to remove 3.5 million cubic yards of polluted sediment from the Passaic's lower 8 miles.

Legal agreements with the polluters are still needed. But EPA Region 2 Administrator Pete Lopez and his staff are targeting 2021 as the start of cleanup work in the lower 8 miles, a project that would last seven years.

In the meantime, Lopez wants to start planning cleanup options for the next 9 miles of the river in Bergen and Passaic counties. The idea is to have work done concurrently with the lower 8-mile project to minimize disruptions such as the opening of bridges, barge traffic and use of heavy machinery like excavators.

“Capping is going to make our children and grandchildren pay for another cleanup.” David Yennior, community advocate

""Our goal is to have the upper section catch up to the lower section so you're doing the work simultaneously,"" Lopez said.

The investigation of the Bergen and Passaic portion of the river was completed in late June, and a report outlining the cleanup options is expected to be made public in October.

Towns along the upper portion include Garfield, Wallington, East Rutherford, Rutherford, Lyndhurst and North Arlington on the Bergen County side of the river, Clifton and the city of Passaic in Passaic County, and Nutley and Belleville in Essex County.

EPA officials are already leaning toward an option to clean up only targeted spots for several reasons. Among them:

The dioxin contamination isn't as extensive as it is in the lower 8 miles, where the Diamond Alkali plant sits.

The river sediment in the upper portion is more coarse and grain-like, so dioxin doesn't cling as stubbornly as it does to the lower portion's fine silt.

But unlike the lower portion of the Passaic, the next nine 9 miles is used extensively for recreation. That means more people have a greater chance to come into direct contact with dioxin, including high school and college crew teams using that part of the river for training and competition.

The EPA already oversaw a smaller dredge-and-cap project in 2013 in the upper 9-mile portion in exposed mudflats near where rowers race. That project saw the first 2 feet of dioxin-laden mud next to Riverside County Park in Lyndhurst excavated, and then the riverbed was lined with layers of rocks, sand and a synthetic covering.

Michael Sivak, chief of the EPA's Passaic River team, said the dioxin levels found elsewhere in the upper 9 miles are not as high as those in the Lyndhurst mudflats. But he said the proposed work would be similar.

Dredging and capping ""is something that is a very common way to deal with this kind of contamination,"" Sivak said.

Many environmentalists, however, have sarcastically dubbed the practice ""pave and wave"" as a means for polluters to get a cheaper cleanup that leaves the public more at risk.

The EPA has approved such controversial plans across North Jersey in recent years, leaving at least a portion of pollution in place at Superfund sites from densely populated Edgewater to the forests of Ringwood.

ENVIRONMENT: NJ budget: Meadowlands Conservation Trust gets $1.5 million

At the meeting in Clifton, Yennior stood and told the 40 people gathered in a building near City Hall that all of the polluted sediment should be dredged from the Passaic because a cap will eventually erode in a tidal river, where water constantly sloshes back and forth.

""Capping is going to make our children and grandchildren pay for another cleanup,"" said Yennior, a Belleville resident who lives a quarter-mile from the river.

Work on the 9 miles of the river in Bergen and Passaic counties would not begin until the second half of 2024, although EPA timelines are often delayed.

Meanwhile, the river's No. 1 threat to human health remains eating fish caught south of the Dundee Dam. Assemblywoman Britnee Timberlake, D-East Orange, said at the meeting that the EPA should consider bolstering its efforts to spread the word to anglers, many of whom are recent arrivals to the U.S. and may not know the dangers.

""We have to get the word out to people,"" Timberlake said. ""I know there are still people who fish this river.""

The Justice Department will not bring charges against Attorney General William Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross after the House voted last week to hold them in criminal contempt.

The DOJ had not been expected to pursue charges against Barr, who oversees the department, or Ross.

""The Department of Justice's long-standing position is that we will not prosecute an official for contempt of Congress for declining to provide information subject to a presidential assertion of executive privilege,"" Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen said in a letter to Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi on Wednesday.

The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee had authorized subpoenas to the Justice and Commerce departments in April demanding information about the administration's attempt to put a citizenship question on the 2020 census.

Barr and Ross had refused to comply with the subpoenas, after Trump asserted executive privilege over the documents. The refusal to comply prompted the Oversight Committee to vote along party lines to hold the officials in contempt. That vote was sent to the entire Democrat-led House, which voted last month to hold the men in contempt.

After a defeat at the Supreme Court, Trump abandoned his fight to add the citizenship question to the census, opting instead to sign an executive order to collect citizenship information from government agencies.

Rosen contended in the letter that the Justice Department has ""consistently adhered to the position that 'the contempt of Congress statute was not intended to apply and could not constitutionally be applied to an Executive Branch official who asserts the President's claim of executive privilege.'""

He cited multiple examples of the department taking the same stance during the Bush and Obama administrations.

""The Department has determined that the responses by the Attorney General and the Secretary of Commerce to the subpoenas issued by the Committee on Oversight and Reform did not constitute a crime,"" Rosen wrote.

A spokeswoman for the Oversight Committee did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment."
Same-sex couple sues State Department for denying daughter's citizenship,https://www.cnn.com,"['Rebekah Riess', 'Jay Croft']",07-24-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/24/us/gay-couple-daughter-citizenship-lawsuit/index.html,"(CNN) A same-sex married couple in Georgia sued the US State Department on Wednesday for refusing to recognize their daughter as a citizen.

Derek Mize and Jonathan Gregg, who married in New York in 2015, had their daughter Simone Mize-Gregg via surrogacy in England in 2018, their lawyer said in a statement. Both fathers are listed on the birth certificate.

When they applied for Simone's US citizenship, the US consulate in London rejected their application, the release said. ""The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) states that children of married U.S. citizens born abroad are U.S. citizens from birth so long as one of their parents has lived in the U.S. at some point, but the State Department routinely denies that right to same-sex couples and their children,"" the statement says.

""The State Department's policy is not only cruel, it is unconstitutional. The government refuses to recognize Jonathan and Derek's marriage and all of Simone's rights as a U.S. citizen,"" Aaron C. Morris, one of the couple's attorneys and executive director of Immigration Equality , said.

A State Department spokesperson declined to comment on the lawsuit, saying it does not comment on pending litigation.

Michael Drobot, who operated Pacific Hospital Long Beach, has agreed to plead guilty to charges of wire fraud, engaging in monetary transactions in property derived from unlawful activity and criminal contempt of court.

Drobot, 74, formerly of Corona del Mar, is serving a five-year sentence at Taft Correctional Institution in Kern County. He faces a maximum sentence of 50 years in federal prison on the new charges, and will be arraigned in coming weeks in U.S. District Court in Santa Ana, according to the Department of Justice.

Drobot’s attorney did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Drobot, 74, pleaded guilty in 2014 to orchestrating a scheme authorities dubbed Operation Spinal Cap, which paid more than $50 million in bribes to doctors and other health professionals in exchange for steering spinal surgeries and other procedures to his hospital. Former state Sen. Ron Calderon also was convicted of taking bribes from Drobot.

As part of his plea, Drobot was ordered by the court to forfeit $10 million to the United States government. So the Aston Martin on the auction block in August 2018 — along with his 1958 Porsche and his 1971 Mercedes-Benz — was a penance of sorts, helping to fulfill that obligation and provide restitution to victims.

The Aston alone was valued by RM Sotheby’s auctioneers at $1.2 million to $1.4 million, and ultimately sold for $1.5 million.

But rather than forwarding sale proceeds to the government, as promised, Drobot disobeyed the court order and illegally kept the proceeds for himself, the U.S. Department of Justice said in court filings this week. (Drobot No. 1, Drobot No. 2).

Drobot conveyed an interest in the Aston Martin to the classic car auction company in exchange for a $1 million advance on the sale proceeds on June 22, 2018, the DOJ said. That $1 million was wired to Drobot’s bank account and used “for personal expenses and not to satisfy the court’s forfeiture order. Drobot further admitted to laundering the money via transfers to third parties,” the DOJ said.

In February, the DOJ seized Drobot’s interest in his Newport Beach home and Perris business property to help satisfy the order, said spokesman Ciaran McEvoy.

Prosecutors have charged 17 people, and won 10 convictions, as part of Operation Spinal Cap, the $1 billion health care fraud scheme Drobot spearheaded. The accused hail from Manhattan Beach, Newport Beach, Redondo Beach, Palos Verdes Estates, Santa Ana, San Clemente and many other cities.

Patients wait

Thousands of patients received surgeries at Pacific Hospital not knowing that Drobot had bribed their physician to perform their surgery at Pacific Hospital, prosecutors said in court documents.

“The patients believed that they were receiving conflict-free medical advice when, in fact, (Drobot) illegally incentivized their physician to perform the surgery at Pacific Hospital,” they wrote.

Waiting not so patiently in the wings now, as the government’s mammoth probe proceeds, are those patients, who seek redress.

In an avalanche of lawsuits, more than 160 patients contend that cheap, nonsurgical-grade hardware may have been drilled into their bones during operations that might not have been necessary to begin with, leaving them in excruciating pain.

Their suits, in civil court, target doctors and hospitals allegedly involved in the scheme — but those suits are in a deep freeze so as not to interfere with the DOJ’s criminal probe.

Doctors and hospitals targeted by those lawsuits — who have not been charged in the federal criminal probe — deny wrongdoing, including knowingly using inferior product in surgeries. Drobot has said his companies never bought or used any knock-off screws or parts for spinal surgeries.

How much of that $10 million might patients see?

Drobot’s forfeited money goes into a government forfeiture fund, and there’s a process called remission where victims can request their share, said DOJ spokesman McEvoy.

“It would be fair and just — and seems to me the only right answer — for the bulk of whatever’s recovered from Drobot and his co-defendants to go to the actual patients who are suffering,” said attorney Justin Berger, who represents whistleblowers in the case.

Attorneys have asked the court to allow some of the patients’ civil lawsuits to move forward, and that will be considered on Tuesday, July 30.

“We’re hopeful that — given the passage of time, that patients continue to live in pain and that patients continue to die — some or all of these suits will be set for trial soon,” Berger said. “There are doctors still walking around as free men without any indictments — I hope this means there will be continued cooperation and the government will go after all the wrongdoers.”"
