Ivanka’s North Korea Photobombs Perplex White House Officials,https://www.thedailybeast.com,"['Erin Banco', 'Asawin Suebsaeng', 'National Security Reporter', 'White House Reporter']",07-02-2019,2019,7,https://www.thedailybeast.com/ivanka-trumps-north-korea-photobombs-perplex-white-house-officials,"When Donald Trump and his advisers crossed over from South Korea into the heavily fortified demilitarized zone between North and South Korea over the weekend, the cameras were ready. Images of the president greeting North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un as “my friend” in a last-minute meet-up streamed across televisions worldwide.

Trump wasn’t alone. After a few snapshots, Ivanka Trump, along with her husband, Jared Kushner, followed the president into what’s known as the Freedom House—a building on the South Korean side of the zone. That’s when the cameras stopped. The media was reportedly blocked from entering and covering the historic event.

It wasn’t until later that reporters learned Ivanka and Kushner did more than accompany the president into the Freedom House. They were reportedly present at a closed-door meeting between the two leaders, who ended up speaking about one of the most sensitive topics on the planet—North Korea’s nuclear weapons program.

“ She matters because the president says she matters. Who in their right mind would cross her knowing that? ” — former administration official

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. After this story was published, an official reached out and said: “Although they met Kim, Jared and Ivanka did not participate in the closed-door meeting.” The official did not clarify which meeting Ivanka and Jared participated in or how many meetings were held on the border. But two other officials told The Daily Beast that Ivanka and Kushner were in the room for conversations that pertained to nuclear weapons and sanctions.

President Trump has long used his family, particularly his son-in-law, to run various foreign policy projects, leading to investigations on Capitol Hill over security clearances and the administration’s circumvention of traditional foreign policy procedure. Former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said in a recent congressional interview that he was often left in the dark about various high-stakes foreign policy decisions because Kushner at times ran his own shadow State Department, meeting secretly with world leaders from countries such as Mexico and Saudi Arabia.

The meeting in the DMZ seemed to spur a new sense of frustration in Washington on Monday, this time directed in particular at the first daughter, who was also present—front and center—at the G20 summit in Hamburg. She provided a video readout about the conversations Trump had with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and took photo-ops with attendees.

“Ivanka has participated in previous bilateral meetings, and on behalf of the White House at past G20 summits,” said Garrett Marquis, a spokesperson for the National Security Council. “Issues of women’s empowerment are central to the president’s national security and women’s peace and security strategies.”

Photos and video footage from the conference emerged over the weekend, showing Ivanka mingling with some of the top world leaders, inserting herself into conversations with veterans of the foreign policy world. The internet erupted, and lawmakers took to social media.

“It may be shocking to some, but being someone’s daughter actually isn’t a career qualification,” Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) said on Twitter. “It hurts our diplomatic standing when the President phones it in & the world moves on.”

One senior administration official told The Daily Beast that the Trump team often tries to find roles for Ivanka on travels overseas because she is a talented spokesperson. But it is unclear what Ivanka was doing in North Korea beyond the purely ceremonial. Two senior administration officials and one former one said they do not consider the president’s daughter a significant player on major foreign policy initiatives, including on the Koreas, though they all acknowledged that President Trump will at least solicit her advice for gut checks on any manner of foreign policy and national security decision: striking other countries, climate agreements, and so on.

“She matters because the president says she matters,” the former official said. “Who in their right mind would cross her knowing that?”

A current official noted that she is often in the room during important policy discussions and read-into those matters specifically, and at times exclusively, because her father demanded it.

It’s not only Trump’s aides and advisers who have taken note of that; foreign leaders have factored it into their diplomacy and flattery of Trump, as well. Prime Minister Abe is known to go out of his way to ask the president how Ivanka is doing and ask about her interest in global women’s empowerment projects, another one of the current senior Trump administration officials said.

Still, Ivanka’s protected status in the Trump orbit has frustrated several high-ranking aides over the years, including the president’s one-time chief strategist Steve Bannon and former White House chief of staff John Kelly, the latter of whom reportedly complained in private that Ivanka is merely “playing government,” according to a CNN report early last year.

That report came at a time when Ivanka’s trip to South Korea, as leader of a U.S. delegation at the closing ceremony of the Winter Olympics, perplexed, if not outright aggravated, several of her fellow senior colleagues, chief among them Kelly, a former White House official said.

Lawmakers on Capitol Hill have looked into how and why the administration’s foreign policy has shifted at the hands of Trump’s family. The House Foreign Affairs Committee, in particular, has scrutinized Kushner’s relationship with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman. Tillerson, in his interview with the committee in May, said the inclusion of Ivanka and Kushner in the national security process made his job more difficult.

“One of the challenges I think that everyone had… to learn to deal with was the role, the unique situation with the president’s son-in-law [Kushner] and daughter [Ivanka] being part of the White House advisory team,” Tillerson said. “There was not a real clear understanding of the role, responsibilities, authorities… which made it challenging for everyone.”"
Exclusive: Trump shares plans to combat homelessness and mental illness in interview with Tucker Carlson,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Nick Givas', 'Nick Givas Is A Reporter With Fox News. You Can Find Him On Twitter At']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-tucker-exclusive-interview-homelessness,"President Trump sat down with Fox News host Tucker Carlson for an exclusive interview during his visit to Japan for the G20 summit and shared his plans to combat rising homelessness and mental illness in America.

During the interview, Trump told Carlson he is ""looking at it very seriously"" and said some people forced to live on the streets are ""living in hell.""

""It's disgraceful. I'm going to maybe and I'm looking at it very seriously,"" Trump said. ""We're doing some other things that you probably noticed like some of the very important things that we're doing now. But we're looking at it very seriously because you can't do that.

""You can't have what's happening -- where police officers are getting sick just by walking the beat. I mean, they're getting actually very sick, where people are getting sick, where the people living there living in hell, too.""

TUCKER CARLSON SAYS TRUMP 'DOMINATED' KIM AS 'WHEEZING' NORTH KOREAN DICTATOR STRUGGLED

Trump continued, saying most people suffering from homelessness have an accompanying mental illness and sometimes don't realize they're living in their own filth. He also said the issue needs to be addressed before it starts affecting healthy working people as well.

""Some of them have mental problems where they don't even know they're living that way,"" he said. ""In fact, perhaps they like living that way. They can't do that. We cannot ruin our cities. And you have people that work in those cities. They work in office buildings and to get into the building, they have to walk through a scene that nobody would have believed possible three years ago.""

Trump blamed the liberal politicians for exacerbating the problem and said he's been fighting them on all fronts, including within the city limits of Washington, D.C.

""And this is the liberal establishment. This is what I'm fighting,"" he added. ""They -- I don't know if they're afraid of votes. I don't know if they really believe that this should be taking place. But it's a terrible thing that's taking place. And we may be -- you know, I had a situation when I first became president, we had certain areas of Washington, D.C. where that was starting to happen, and I ended it very quickly.

TRUMP SAYS HE'S OPTIMISTIC ABOUT TRADE DEAL WITH CHINESE PRESIDENT XI, IN INTERVIEW WITH TUCKER CARLSON

""When we have leaders of the world coming in to see the President of the United States and they're riding down a highway, they can't be looking at that. I really believe that it hurts our country.

""They can't be looking at scenes like you see in Los Angeles and San Francisco. San Francisco... so we're looking at it very seriously. We may intercede. We may do something to get that whole thing cleaned up. It's inappropriate.""

Trump also said it shouldn't fall on the federal government to address the issue, but didn't give any indication that it would deter his administration from getting involved.

""We're really not very equipped as a government to be doing that kind of work,"" he told Carlson. ""That's not really the kind of work that the government probably should be doing. We've never had this in our lives before in our country. And it's not only those few cities, it's a couple of other ones.""

The president's comments came after figures released last month stated the number of homeless people in Los Angeles County jumped 12 percent over the past year, officials announced Tuesday, despite $619 million in government spending to help alleviate the problem.

The annual point-in-time count recorded nearly 59,000 homeless people countywide, with the largest number -- 36,000 -- coming from the city of Los Angeles. The Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority, a county agency which conducted the count, delivered its report to the Board of Supervisors at its Tuesday meeting.

The 2018 tally found a slight decrease in the homeless population at just over 53,000 people. Supervisor Janice Hahn called the new numbers ""disheartening.""

The count found a 24 percent increase in homeless youth, defined as people under 25, and a 7 percent jump in people 62 or older. An estimated 29 percent of people experiencing homelessness are mentally ill or have substance abuse issues, officials said."
Opinion | The Welcome Humiliation of John Bolton,https://www.nytimes.com,['Michelle Goldberg'],07-01-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/01/opinion/john-bolton-trump.html,"Bolton is sometimes described as a neoconservative, but that’s not really right. Neoconservatives purported to champion the expansion of American values, while Bolton just wants to impose American might. On the surface, he seems an excellent fit with Trump, who is also uninterested in human rights and contemptuous of multilateral institutions. Both are bellicose nationalists, dismissive of climate change, eager to empower the Israeli right, hostile to Islam but solicitous of Saudi Arabia.

But the uber-hawk Bolton, who still refuses to admit that the Iraq war was a mistake, has long believed that America’s most implacable enemies include North Korea, Russia and Iran. One multilateral organization he appears to value is NATO, a counterweight to Russia that he once called “the most successful political-military alliance in human history.” Now, at the summit of his career, he’s part of an administration that makes a mockery of his longtime foreign policy philosophy.

When the George W. Bush administration, in which Bolton also served, lifted some sanctions on North Korea in 2008, Bolton seemed almost heartsick. “Nothing can erase the ineffable sadness of an American presidency, like this one, in total intellectual collapse,” he wrote in The Wall Street Journal.

So one can only imagine the ineffable sadness he felt over the weekend, when Trump stepped into North Korea to shake the hand of his friend Kim Jong-un, North Korea’s totalitarian leader. On Sunday, The New York Times reported that the Trump administration was considering putting aside the goal of getting North Korea to surrender the nuclear weapons it already has, instead trying to get the country to stop making new nuclear material.

Given Trump’s limitations as a statesman, that’s probably the best that can be hoped for. But it’s almost certainly not what Bolton, who was calling for pre-emptive strikes on North Korea just before Trump appointed him, thought he was signing up for. In response to the Times article, Bolton tweeted angrily that he’d heard of no such plan, though he might have simply been out of the loop. After all, while Trump was flattering Kim, Bolton was in Mongolia."
Lurching left: Are Democrats blowing their chance to beat Trump?,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Howard Kurtz', 'Howard Kurtz Is A Fox News Analyst', 'The Host Of']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/lurching-left-are-democrats-blowing-their-chance-to-beat-trump,"It's standard practice in presidential politics: Candidates move to the left (or right) to win the nomination, then tack toward the center in the general election.

But the Democrats are in danger of marching so far left that they go over a cliff.

That's not just my view. Mainstream reporters, who tend to be less sensitive to liberal positions that match their personal views, are openly acknowledging and debating the dramatic shift. It was even on the front page of The New York Times.

For those whose most fervent desire is to evict Donald Trump from the White House, there's growing concern that the Democrats are blowing it.

GUTFELD: IT'S ALL DOWNHILL FOR BIDEN, HARRIS LIKELY TO BE DEM NOMINEE

The two debates in Miami last week crystallized how most of the candidates are taking stances that would antagonize many millions of Americans once you get out of the liberal bubble.

And the few contenders who are positioning themselves as left-of-center moderates are muting those views in the face of palpable progressive pressure. So with Trump already signaling that he plans to run against a socialist party, they — including Joe Biden and Amy Klobuchar — are being lumped in with the left-wingers.

We're talking here about big, fundamental stuff, especially on health insurance and immigration. And in some instances, these are positions that no presidential candidate other than Bernie would have dared take in 2016. But now, the aspirants are torn between the burning desire to beat Trump and the overwhelming urge to be in lockstep with a ""woke"" party. And those two imperatives are coming into direct conflict.

GUY BENSON: HARRIS' ATTACK ON BIDEN SHOWS HE ISN'T 'PREORDAINED FRONT-RUNNER'

The Democrats are now a party where all 10 candidates on stage raised their hands to support health services for illegal immigrants. As recently as 2016, Hillary Clinton drew flak for not having fully embraced a New York plan to give driver's licenses to illegal immigrants. And no one aggressively challenged Julian Castro when he called for decriminalizing illegal border crossings.

The Democrats are now a party where several top contenders (including Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris, despite the latter's subsequent attempt to fudge the issue) support government-run health care that would abolish private medical insurance for more than 150 million Americans.

The Democrats are now a party calling for free college tuition or free community college, which would be hugely expensive.

The Times news story flat-out declares the debates showed that ""many of the leading presidential candidates are breaking with the incremental politics of the Clinton and Obama eras, and are embracing sweeping liberal policy changes on some of the most charged public issues in American life, even at the risk of political backlash.""

And: ""With moderate Democrats repeatedly drowned out or on the defensive in the debates, the sprint to the left has deeply unnerved establishment Democrats, who have largely picked the party nominees in recent decades.""

Two leading Clintonites, James Carville and Rahm Emanuel, are on the record as ripping the leftward march. Says Carville: ""This is an election that Trump can’t win but Democrats can lose.""

Even more biting are pieces by two moderately conservative but anti-Trump columnists for the Times.

David Brooks, who says he couldn't vote for Trump in a million years, writes under the headline ""Dems, Please Don't Drive Me Away"":

DONNA BRAZILE: BIDEN'S ADVISERS SHOULD HAVE BETTER PREPARED HIM FOR HARRIS CHALLENGE

""The party is moving toward all sorts of positions that drive away moderates and make it more likely the nominee will be unelectable. And it's doing it without too much dissent.""

Brooks says, for instance, that ""Democrats are wandering into dangerous territory on immigration. They properly trumpet the glories immigrants bring to this country. But the candidates can't let anybody get to the left of them on this issue. So now you've got a lot of candidates who sound operationally open borders. Progressive parties all over the world are getting decimated because they have fallen into this pattern.""

Bret Stephens says the Dems are becoming ""a party that makes too many Americans feel like strangers in their own country.""

He goes into an us-versus-them riff:

""They speak Spanish. We don't. They are not U.S. citizens or legal residents. We are. They broke the rules to get into this country. We didn't. They pay few or no taxes. We already pay most of those taxes. They willingly got themselves into debt. We're asked to write it off. They don't pay the premiums for private health insurance. We're supposed to give up ours in exchange for some V.A.-type nightmare. They didn't start enterprises that create employment and drive innovation.""

And when a candidate like Biden offers more incremental change, essentially a return to the Obama era, he is mocked and dismissed for living in the past.

It's not like the hard-left proposals will be magically forgotten in the fall of 2020. The Democrats sure are giving Trump plenty of ammunition."
Defense Department to ban beer and pizza? Mandatory keto diet may enhance military performance,https://www.militarytimes.com,"['Kristine Froeba', 'Mark D. Faram']",07-01-2019,2019,7,https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-military/2019/07/01/defense-department-to-ban-beer-and-pizza-mandatory-keto-diet-may-enhance-military-performance/,"The controversial ketogenic or “keto” diet may be the future of the military, some defense officials say.

Service members, and Navy SEALS especially, may have to forgo beer and burritos for skinny cocktails and avocado salad (forget the tortilla chips) if a proposal from Special Operations Command gains momentum.

While a nutritionally enhanced future could eventually be put into effect for all branches, the SEALS and other underwater dive-mission specialists might be the first groups targeted for the change in nutritional guidelines.

Lisa Sanders, the director of science and technology at U.S. Special Operations Command, presented an Ohio State University study that recommends the nutritional change based on the keto diet, which is high in fat and low in carbohydrates. The diet works to deprive the body of glucose needed for energy and forces it to burn stored fats instead. The study was conducted on the university’s Army ROTC cadet population.

“One of the effects of truly being in ketosis is that it changes the way your body handles oxygen deprivation, so you can actually stay underwater at depths for longer periods of time and not go into oxygen seizures,” Sanders said at the Special Operations Forces Industry Conference last month.

Discussion of new dietary guidelines for service members comes at a time of growing concern about obesity in the military and its potential threat to readiness.

The possibly controversial change for the military is not without problems, not the least of which are questions about whether the military has the legal and ethical authority to control and monitor a service member’s diet 24/7.

Daily ketosis testing?

Service members are familiar with physical training in boot camp and their routine Physical Fitness Tests, but are they ready for daily dietary ketosis testing?

For the keto nutritional plan to be successful, it has to be followed strictly, and that includes after-hours and weekends. Even a service member on leave would possibly face a restricted diet because it simply takes too long for the body to readjust and function in the ketosis stage after a weekend of dietary backsliding and binging on pizza, burritos, and beers.

The keto diet requires the body to be in a constant state of ketosis. Daily urine or blood tests using strips are necessary to measure glucose or ketone levels.

Revamping MREs?

For the diet to be implemented laterally across the military, produce choices and meat quality at military dining facilities across the world would have to change significantly, not to mention the high-carb and sugar content of MRE’s. The popular pepperoni pizza MRE would be a thing of the past.

Although one benefit of formulating a new high-fat food ration is that it would be a lighter weight for service members to carry.

“You can carry even more calories because fats weigh less, which is an advantage,” said Kinesiologist Jeff Volek, a professor at Ohio State University’s Department of Human Sciences and author of the study.

On military bases, the dietary change could result in future dining facilities serving Ezekiel bread, zucchini “pasta spirals” to replace pasta, mashed cauliflower as a substitute for potatoes and rice, and avocado-heavy salad bars replacing soft-serve ice cream machines and dessert bars.

No fries with that at the DFAC

In addition to the regulatory and privacy questions about the proposed dietary change, there are also economic questions. Not only would DFACS and the military have to change, military households would have to follow suit as the diet requires higher quantities and quality of vegetables, fats, and proteins throughout the day.

If a keto meal plan became the required diet of the military’s future, some say military budgets, salaries and allowances may also have to rise to meet the economic demands required to follow the dietary guidelines on duty and off. But Volek, author of the study, disagrees.

“The ketogenic diet is high in fat, which is less costly,"" Volek said. The majority of the diet is based on fat, and fat calories can be very cheap. “Meats, eggs, fish, chicken, cheese, butter, seeds, nuts, and non-starchy vegetables are the basis of the diet. Fat is the key or primary nutrient.”"
Exclusive: Democrats investigating whistleblower claims Pompeo's security picked up Chinese food and his dog,https://www.cnn.com,['Michelle Kosinski'],07-01-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/01/politics/pompeo-democrats-whistleblower-claims/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Democrats on a key House congressional committee are investigating allegations from a whistleblower within the State Department about Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and his family's use of taxpayer-funded Diplomatic Security -- prompting agents to lament they are at times viewed as ""UberEats with guns"".

Congressional investigators, who asked for the committee not to be named as they carry out their inquiries, tell CNN that a State Department whistleblower has raised multiple issues over a period of months, about special agents being asked to carry out some questionable tasks for the Pompeo family.

In April, for example, an agent was asked to pick up Chinese food—without Pompeo in the car. The whistleblower said this led agents to complain that they are now serving as ""UberEats with guns,"" which has created a buzz within the department, according to multiple Democratic congressional aides who cited the whistleblower.

On another occasion, the whistleblower told aides, a Diplomatic Security special agent was given the job of picking up the Pompeo family dog from a groomer.

And CNN has seen a document given to the committee aides by the whistleblower showing that in January, Diplomatic Security was asked by a person in Pompeo's office to pick up his adult son from Union Station in Washington and bring him to the family home.

Lon Fairchild, the special agent in Charge of the Diplomatic Security Service, did not deny that the specific trips, such as the dog or the takeout food, were carried out by agents, but said in a statement, ""I was head of Secretary Pompeo's security detail since his first day on the job. At no point during my service did he or any member of his family ask me or any member of my team to act in any way that would be inconsistent with our professional obligation to protect the Secretary 24-hours a day, 7-days a week.""

A former senior Diplomatic Security official told CNN such tasks would not be appropriate—especially without the Secretary himself in the car at the time—unless some specific threat was identified that necessitated those trips. For example, they said when former Secretary of State Warren Christopher started in the job, he had hoped his agents would go get groceries for him, but had to be told that that's not what they do.

The Diplomatic Security Service is the law enforcement and security arm of the State Department tasked with protecting US diplomacy and diplomats worldwide and securing the integrity of US travel documents.

While protecting the security of the secretary of state is an important task for the service, there are concerns that agents may have been asked to carry out inappropriate tasks while assigned to Pompeo.

According to the Code of Federal Regulations, a federal employee ""shall not encourage, direct, coerce, or request a subordinate to use official time to perform activities other than those required in the performance of official duties or authorized in accordance with law or regulation.""

It is unclear if Pompeo requested the allegedly improper arrangements or whether they were made by someone on his staff without his knowledge.

But the whistleblower said there is a culture within Diplomatic Security to try and please the secretary and avoid upsetting him.

Former government ethics czar Walter Shaub told CNN ""sending subordinates to run personal errands for you is the very definition of misuse of position.""

Concerns about Susan Pompeo's security arrangements

Those personal-seeming tasks might be eye-catching, but congressional investigators say the State Department whistleblower told them the bigger issue causing concern among some agents is the question of why Pompeo's wife, Susan, has her own security detail, assigned to her in 2018, even while she is at home in the United States.

""There is a lot of confusion among agents over this, over why this is justified,"" one aide told CNN. ""Because according to this source they have seen nothing to indicate it is justified. In fact just the opposite. It's their understanding there was no finding of a high-enough level threat to merit this detail."" The whistleblower told these investigators that multiple special agents and supervisors within Diplomatic Security understood that a formal threat assessment had not been carried out, under longtime standard operating procedure, and that there is no specific threat against Susan Pompeo

Furthermore, the whistleblower told aides that shortly after Susan Pompeo received her personal security detail, in July 2018, agents were verbally told not to use her callsign—which is ""Shocker""—over the radios or publicly. The reason, according to one aide, citing the whistleblower, was that ""they knew it wasn't kosher.""

CNN has viewed an email from within the State Department confirming that she has an agent assigned to her, along with her callsign. The assistant secretary overseeing Diplomatic Security, Michael Evanoff, was included in the correspondence. The subject line says ""Shocker Detail.""

The former senior Diplomatic Security official who asked not to be identified said that such a full-time detail for a spouse is unusual and would only be assigned once a formal process was followed, assessing the need for such security. They said that the risk investigation would be performed by Diplomatic Security's Protective Intelligence and Investigations Division, in the Office of Threat and Intelligence Analysis. The former official told CNN this protocol has existed within Diplomatic Security for decades. And that in this person's lengthy tenure at Diplomatic Security, no spouse was ever given a security detail for more than a short, specific period of time.

One congressional aide told CNN that under the current administration, ""We have a lot of concerns over how things are being conducted within Diplomatic Security. There is a lack of transparency.""

A State Department spokesperson insisted that a threat assessment for Susan Pompeo was carried out by the Protective Intelligence and Investigations Division, but would not tell CNN when that happened.

""The provision of a protective detail to Mrs. Pompeo is expressly authorized by federal law. In this case, Diplomatic Security determined that the threat warranted the provision of such a protective detail to Mrs. Pompeo and began providing it as of July 28, 2018.""

In a statement, Assistant Secretary of State for Diplomatic Security Michael Evanoff said, ""The Diplomatic Security Service has been protecting the spouse of the Secretary of State since the 1970s as the security threat dictates. We are a federal law enforcement agency, and this is an integral part of our core mission. Today the security threats against Secretary Pompeo and his family are unfortunately very real. The Diplomatic Security Service is proud to protect the Pompeo family from those who would harm the Secretary of State and the United States.""

Concerns about how Trump admin officials have used government resources

These questions about Pompeo are the latest in a slew of ethics allegations surrounding Trump administration Cabinet secretaries and their use of government resources.

Former Environmental Protection Agency administrator Scott Pruitt left his position after a series of ethical questions about his security team; the former head of Health and Human Services, Tom Price , resigned after a scandal over his use of private planes; Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson was assailed for extravagant taxpayer-funded furniture purchases . Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke stepped down amid probes of his real estate dealings and conduct in office. And Former Secretary of Veterans Affairs David Shulkin left that job under an ethics cloud after a damning inspector general report criticized him for improperly accepting gifts and misrepresenting travel plans.

The aides said another whistleblower has come forward, who worked on the State Department's executive seventh floor where the secretary of state and top aides are based—telling them that employees there have been told not to put information concerning Susan Pompeo into official emails, so that it would not be preserved in required recordkeeping.

The role Susan Pompeo has played within the State Department and when the secretary travels is another area of concern to congressional aides, Diplomatic Security officers and multiple sources within the State Department and the CIA, which Pompeo previously led.

Several sources told CNN when Susan Pompeo accompanies the secretary on certain trips she has not only had a dedicated special agent to tend to her, but also a State Department staffer.

They said that ahead of a recent trip to Kansas, during which she accompanied her husband, she had at times chaired meetings on trip logistics at the State Department, which raised eyebrows, including of senior State officials.

One person familiar with the situation called it ""the worst kept secret at State,"" telling CNN, ""[Secretary Pompeo] takes her on ... trips, has separate meetings, requiring control officers, motor pool assets, security, and time. It was especially brazen during the shutdown when people were actually called into the embassy while furloughed. Just one more thing killing morale at the department."""

18 senior Pentagon roles are currently filled by temporary officials or vacant,https://www.cnn.com,"['Barbara Starr', 'Cnn Pentagon Correspondent']",07-01-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/01/politics/pentagon-vacancies-list/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Eighteen of the most senior roles at the Pentagon lack permanent appointees, the Department of Defense confirmed to CNN on Monday, providing a complete list of positions currently being filled by temporary officials.

It is a reflection of the Department of Defense's ongoing struggle to establish an unprecedented transition plan aimed at ensuring continuity of leadership at the highest levels while there is still no confirmed secretary of defense.

The top priority is to get Mark Esper's nomination to the Senate Armed Services Committee so a confirmation hearing for the acting secretary of defense can be scheduled quickly. Esper stepped into the acting position following the dramatic implosion of Patrick Shanahan's nomination last month.

Due to federal regulations, Esper is expected to have to instantly step down as the acting secretary during that confirmation process, several officials have said. Government lawyers are looking to see if there are any loopholes that could keep him in the job through a confirmation vote, a defense official previously told CNN.

Still, it is now increasingly likely that Navy Secretary Richard Spencer will be named acting defense secretary for a brief period when Esper is formally nominated for the permanent role, making him the third acting defense secretary to serve under President Donald Trump.

While the ketogenic diet isn't praised for being the easiest to follow, stocking your pantry or your desk at work with store-bought keto snacks can make it easier.

If you're considering going keto or already riding the diet train, you know that the ketogenic diet calls for eating high-fat, low-carb foods to get your body to burn fat instead of carbs for fuel. Scientifically, this is a metabolic state of the body called ketosis. The list of keto-friendly foods includes meat, seafood, eggs, full-fat dairy products, above ground vegetables and oils. The do-not eat list is filled with foods higher in carbs like pasta, rice, starches (like potatoes), bread and high-carb fruits (like bananas).

AOC says migrants forced to drink toilet water after tense border visit,https://nypost.com,['July'],07-01-2019,2019,7,https://nypost.com/2019/07/01/aoc-says-migrants-forced-to-drink-toilet-water-after-tense-border-visit/,"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez claims Border Patrol agents are forcing migrants to drink out of toilets and live under other extreme conditions — while the officers sit back and laugh.

“I see why CBP officers were being so physically &sexually threatening towards me,” the congresswoman tweeted Monday after leaving a US Customs and Border Protection facility in Texas.

“Officers were keeping women in cells w/ no water & had told them to drink out of the toilets,” she said. “This was them on their GOOD behavior in front of members of Congress.”

The New York lawmaker was visiting a number of migrant detention centers scattered along the southern border on Monday with other congressional Democrats following reports of terrible conditions and repeated sexual assaults.

“Now I’ve seen the inside of these facilities,” Ocasio-Cortez tweeted. “It’s not just the kids. It’s everyone. People drinking out of toilets, officers laughing in front of members Congress.”

She added, “I brought it up to their superiors. They said ‘officers are under stress & act out sometimes.’ No accountability.”

Ocasio-Cortez claimed that she “forced” herself into a cell with a group of female migrants and began speaking to them.

“One of them described their treatment at the hands of officers as ‘psychological warfare’ – waking them at odd hours for no reason, calling them wh*res, etc,” she said. “Tell me what about that is due to a ‘lack of funding?'”

The freshman legislator was planning to visit detention facilities in Clint — where the Trump administration “was denying children toothpaste and soap,” she said.

“This has been horrifying so far,” Ocasio–Cortez concluded. “It is hard to understate the enormity of the problem. We’re talking systemic cruelty w/ a dehumanizing culture that treats them like animals.”

A CBP official denied the toilet accusations on Monday, insisting that the locations Ocasio-Cortez visited have standard-issue jail-type appliances with sinks that dispense safe drinking water attached to toilets in a single unit.

“‘No one is drinking toilet water,” the official said. “They’re drinking potable water from the sink attached to the toilet.” It’s what you would find in every municipal jail in the United States.”

Ocasio-Cortez has accused CBP agents of making threats to her life on social media — saying a “secret Facebook group” of 9,500 officers discussed making a GoFundMe to harm her and the other Dems during their visits Monday.

“This isn’t about ​’​a few bad eggs,'” Ocasio-Cortez tweeted early Monday afternoon. “This is a violent culture.​”​

Rep. Judy Chu, of California, was among the congressional leaders who visited the centers with Ocasio-Cortez and also recounted what she saw on Twitter.

“‘If you want water, just drink from a toilet.’ That’s what border patrol told one thirsty woman we met on today’s #DemsAtTheBorder trip,” Chu tweeted, along with a video in which she described the conditions.

“What we saw was appalling and disgusting,” the congresswoman said. “There seriously has to be some changes.”

Monday’s border visit was met with outrage from local Trump supporters, who were caught on video heckling the Democratic lawmakers in both English and Spanish as they attempted to hold a press conference.

“Go take care of your country!” shouted one man, who repeatedly yelled “Trump 2020” with several others.

“You guys are retarded!” he added. “Cry me a river!”

Ocasio-Cortez, who spoke at the presser, got told to “go back to New York City” at one point.

“Nobody wants you here!” a heckler screamed.

“Did you bring your onion?!” another asked, blasting Ocasio-Cortez for shedding “fake tears.”

Videos from the presser were posted online by the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. Attempts to reach the group were not immediately successful."
U.S. states sue EPA for stricter asbestos rules,https://www.reuters.com,"['Jonathan Stempel', 'Min Read']",07-01-2019,2019,7,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-asbestos-lawsuit/us-states-sue-epa-for-stricter-asbestos-rules-idUSKCN1TW3N6,"(Reuters) - Ten U.S. states and Washington, D.C. sued the Environmental Protection Agency to begin working on rules to tighten oversight of asbestos, and reduce the health risks that the substance poses to the public.

The attorneys general from California and Massachusetts, Xavier Becerra and Maura Healey, said on Monday they are leading the case, after the EPA denied the states’ petition that it collect more data on asbestos.

A spokesman for the EPA and its administrator, Andrew Wheeler, said the agency does not discuss pending litigation.

Asbestos is a carcinogen once used widely in fireproofing and insulation. Many companies stopped using it by the mid-1970s after it was linked to mesothelioma and other types of cancer.

Federal law still allows limited uses of asbestos, and Congress in 2016 amended the federal Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) to create a process for regulating the substance. Symptoms from asbestos exposure can take decades to surface.

“Asbestos is a known carcinogen that kills tens of thousands of people every year, yet the Trump administration is choosing to ignore the very serious health risks it poses,” Healey, a Democrat, said in a statement.

“There’s too much at stake to let the EPA ignore the danger that deadly asbestos poses to our communities, including to workers and children,” added Becerra, also a Democrat.

Connecticut, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, Oregon and Washington state joined the lawsuit.

The EPA has said protecting people from asbestos exposure is a priority, including through an April rule giving it power to review asbestos products that were no longer on the market before they could be sold again in the United States.

In denying the states’ petition, the EPA determined that it was already aware of all current uses of asbestos, and had the essential information needed to assess the risks, according to the Federal Register.

But the states believe this denial was arbitrary and capricious, and violated the EPA’s obligations under the TSCA.

The lawsuit was filed late on Friday in the federal court in Oakland, California.

It is one of many lawsuits by Democratic-controlled or Democratic-leaning states challenging policies by the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump, a Republican, including the rolling back of some environmental protections.

The case is California et al v Environmental Protection Agency et al, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 19-03807."
These USDA employees face a stark choice: Move to Kansas City or be fired,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Joe Davidson', 'Columnist Focusing On Federal Government Issues']",07-01-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/07/01/these-usda-employees-face-stark-choice-move-kansas-city-or-be-fired/,"

The Agriculture Department is offering employees a rare choice: accept a forced transfer to a post 1,000 miles away or be fired.

The Trump administration’s plan to move two agencies from the District to the Kansas City area includes a document with two blank boxes on it, sent to employees on June 13. Check one, it instructs: Accept the transfer by July 15 or “be separated by adverse action procedures.”

That means getting fired, with an opportunity to appeal the dismissal through what could be an expensive process. Getting fired could also make it more difficult to find another federal job in an area where the government dominates.

Although a limited number of buyouts and early retirement opportunities will be available for what union officials expect to be fewer than 15 percent of those affected, and while some USDA employees might find work in government positions elsewhere in the D.C. area, the disruption to employees generally will be substantial.

“Adverse action” can have another meaning that goes beyond the affected employees and more broadly hits taxpayers, organizations and businesses. In addition to the big hassle for workers, relocations could have an adverse impact — a major brain drain — on the work of the two agencies, the Economic Research Service and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture.

Union officials estimate a strong majority of employees will decline reassignment. If that happens, the work of the small but important agencies could be seriously upset. Even before Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue announced the Kansas City region as the new location, but after officials said the agencies would be moving out of the District, department employees quit in droves, my colleague Ben Guarino reported last month.

“The current and projected attrition will curtail research data products that encompass commodity estimates, agricultural sector forecasts, food and farm economic and statistical indicators for U.S. agriculture, conservation, and food policy and markets,” said Kevin Hunt, a 10-year USDA employee, speaking as acting vice president of the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) Local 3403 representing research service staff.

What the government calls “directed reassignments” to a different city are “very rare in the federal government. That's not something that is a common practice,” said Joanna Friedman, a federal employment lawyer with the Federal Practice Group. “This is unprecedented.”

When the Pentagon closed bases around the country starting in 2005, it forced many defense civilians to make a similar choice. “We lost a lot of talent in geographic moves,” said Jeffrey Neal, formerly the top personnel officer at the Defense Logistics Agency and the Department of Homeland Security. “A 20 percent take-up rate is typical.”

Not only are government transfers like the USDA’s uncommon, but the size makes this one especially unusual. Typically, they are much smaller, said Neal, now a senior vice president with the ICF consulting firm. “Years ago, people were more likely to move with their jobs,” he added. “With most people living in two-wage-earner households, it is far more difficult to just pack up and go.”

Many, perhaps most, affected USDA employees are considering a third option — quit and find new work.

“I will be unemployed beyond Sept. 30,” which is the deadline for the District-based workers to report to the new location, Hunt said, “unless I can find another job.”

Of the 547 employees the department wants to move for the two agencies combined, 253 are with the Economic Research Service, 77 percent of its 329-person workforce. An additional 294 are with the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, 93 percent of its 315-person staff. News of the move prompted a surge of support for the union. Employees at the National Institute voted 137-2 to join AFGE two weeks ago. Last month’s vote at the economic service was 138-4.

When Perdue announced the moves to the Kansas City area, he said, “We did not undertake these relocations lightly, and we are doing it to enhance long-term sustainability and success of these agencies. The considerable taxpayer savings will allow us to be more efficient and improve our ability to retain more employees in the long run.”

But the USDA estimate of nearly $300 million in savings over 15 years is way off, according to an analysis by the Milwaukee-based Agricultural and Applied Economics Association. Instead, it would cost taxpayers between $83 and $182 million, the analysis found. The USDA underestimated the true cost in part because it did not account for “the lost value of research from staffers who resign or retire rather than move,” the association reported.

A group of Democratic senators, including all four from Maryland and Virginia, has introduced legislation to keep the headquarters of the two agencies within the D.C. area.

Andrew Crane-Droesch, an economist with the research service, said he is not moving and is now looking for another job in the D.C. area. “Definitely the choice we face is move to Kansas City or lose our jobs,” he said. “I’m certainly not happy. I love my job, but I can’t move to Kansas City, and moreover, I don’t want to even if I could.”

Like Crane-Droesch, these staffers “have families, they are part of a community and they’ve been dedicated public servants,” said Rep. Gerald E. Connolly (D-Va.), chairman of the House Oversight and Reform subcommittee on government operations. “They deserve better than having such a radical and consequential do-or-die decision, which is hardly a fair choice, thrown at them at the last minute.”

Trump in Asia: ‘We’re the Hottest Show in Town’,https://www.nytimes.com,['Peter Baker'],07-01-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/01/us/politics/trump-asia-trip.html,"Using the initials for North Korea’s formal name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Mr. Carafano added: “If D.P.R.K. doesn’t come through, then his supporters will give him chips for trying, we are no worse off and D.P.R.K. is just as isolated, no matter how many selfies Kim has with Trump.”

The selfie with Mr. Kim was Mr. Trump’s most celebrated and criticized act during his trip, the one that put on display his flair for improvisation and spectacle. No other president would have posted a message on Twitter inviting North Korea’s dictator to meet him at the Demilitarized Zone barely 24 hours later and then step over the line to become the first sitting president to enter North Korea.

In another administration, such a move might have been deliberated for weeks, put through an interagency process and approved only as part of a comprehensive approach to pressuring North Korea into giving up its nuclear program — a reward for progress. Mr. Trump himself had previously been talked out of just such a move by cautious advisers. But this time he could not resist the idea of a showy “first,” whether it fit a long-term strategy or not.

In creating his preferred version of the story, Mr. Trump said he just came up with the idea when he woke up in Osaka on Saturday morning and spontaneously posted the message on Twitter. It was true that he caught his aides off guard, forcing them to scramble to see if a tweet could be turned into reality.

But it was not true that he just thought of it Saturday morning. He had talked about it at least five days earlier with journalists for The Hill news organization, which was then asked by the White House not to reveal that out of security concerns.

As with so many things, that reality did not fit neatly into the story line Mr. Trump was fashioning, so it was disregarded. The other part of his chronicle was how he was cleaning up the “fiery mess” he said was left by Mr. Obama.

He claimed that Mr. Obama wanted to meet with Mr. Kim only to be rebuffed and that had the last president stayed in office, he would have gone to war with North Korea — a pretty fanciful revision of history, according to advisers to the former president, but one that suited the heroic epic Mr. Trump was writing for himself."
DOJ issues plea to Congress in battle against fentanyl copycats,https://abcnews.go.com,['Abc News'],,,,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/doj-issues-plea-congress-battle-fentanyl-copycats/story?id=64068467,"Department of Justice officials on Monday expressed alarm over an approaching deadline that they argued could significantly roll back recent progress in combating the scourge of fentanyl copycats fueling the country's opioid crisis.

In a briefing with several reporters, the officials called on Congress to quickly pass legislation that would keep fentanyl knockoffs -- primarily produced by overseas distributors -- in a drug category on par with heroin, making it easier for the government to prosecute traffickers.

Joshua Lott/Reuters, FILE

Currently, the so-called ""fentanyl analogues"" are under an emergency ban that is set to expire in February without action by Congress.

""These potential adverse consequences of a lapse in scheduling of fentanyl-like substances goes beyond a simple return to the status quo,"" Amanda Liskamm, the director of Opioid Enforcement and Prevention Efforts in the Office of the Deputy Attorney General, told reporters. ""We expect prosecutions charging substances under the temporary order to be affected, resulting in confusion and even potential trial losses. We are running out of time and if a solution isn't found, prosecutors will undoubtedly be hindered and drug traffickers will undoubtedly be helped.""

According to John Martin, the assistant administrator for the Drug Enforcement Administration, 29,000 of the 72,000 reported U.S. overdose deaths in 2017 were attributed to fentanyl and fentanyl-related substances.

In 2017, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced plans to take aim at one of the leading sources of fentanyl abuse, the synthetic fentanyl that drug traffickers could import from overseas manufacturers either through the mail or in some cases transported across the U.S. southern border.

By making piecemeal chemical alterations to the overall structure of fentanyl, distributors were able to avoid some of the regulations that restricted other drugs listed under the Controlled Substances Act.

The emergency change assisted prosecutors in cases, such as an August 2018, 43-count indictment against two Chinese citizens who were charged with shipping fentanyl analogues to 37 U.S. states over a decade, linked to at least two deaths of Americans in Ohio.

""When a synthetic narcotic was banned, this criminal organization would use its chemical expertise to create an analogue of the drug with a slightly different chemical structure with the same or even more potent effect,"" Liskamm said, later adding that if the suspects were to be extradited to the U.S. to face charges, their prosecution could potentially be affected if the emergency scheduling lapses.

Lawmakers have, for the most part, been receptive to the idea of making the fentanyl-analogue scheduling permanent, under a bill sponsored by Republican Sen. Ron Johnson dubbed the ""Stopping Overdoses of Fentanyl Analogues Act,"" or SOFA Act.

But some Democrats have recently raised concerns with the idea of a blanket re-scheduling for fentanyl-related substances and whether it could result in barriers for researchers examining the potential medically-related uses of fentanyl.

But Martin said that based on his interactions with the DEA's own interagency researchers, he thinks those concerns are overblown.

""I don't think it's going to impact [researchers] greatly at all,"" Martin said. ""They have some concerns but from where I'm sitting I think we're trying to eliminate the perception out there in the research community that it's going to be a hindrance for them to conduct research.""

In a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee Monday, multiple criminal justice reform groups including the ACLU and Drug Policy Alliance also spelled out their objections to the legislation -- arguing the approach would result in harsher sentences and unfair targeting of communities of color, while having little to no effect on deaths from overdosing.

""We believe the Committee is right to be concerned about fentanyl-related deaths, but this approach merely repeats the mistakes of the past by exacerbating our incarceration problem,"" the groups said in the letter. ""The Committee should move away from the belief that increased enforcement powers for the DEA will translate into reduced overdose deaths."""
House Judiciary calls for DOJ inspector general investigation into discrimination claims at FBI Academy,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],06-29-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/house-judiciary-calls-for-doj-inspector-general-investigation-into-discrimination-claims-at-fbi-academy,"Bipartisan leaders of the House Judiciary Committee called for the Justice Department’s inspector general to open an investigation into allegations of discrimination against women at the FBI Academy earlier this week following a federal lawsuit alleging that Quantico is run like a “good old boy network.""

Sixteen former female trainees at the FBI filed a lawsuit in late May claiming that they and dozens of other women had been sexually harassed, subjected to a hostile work environment and outdated gender stereotypes, wrongly kicked out of the training program, unfairly forced to resign or made to think that the continuing the training would be futile, suffered retaliation, and more.

And top members of the congressional committee tasked with overseeing the FBI called the allegations “disturbing” and said that, if true, “such conduct cannot be tolerated.”

The letter, signed this week by two Democrats and two Republicans — Chairman Jerry Nadler of New York and ranking member Doug Collins of Georgia as well as Karen Bass of California and John Ratcliffe of Texas — said they believed America’s diversity should be reflected by the FBI’s agents, emphasized that the FBI’s selection process should be free from bias, and called on DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz to look into it.

“We must ensure potential agents not be deterred from applying because they fear the possibility of such treatment,” they wrote. “We believe these detailed allegations require an investigation into the FBI’s training and selection prices for new agents.”

A representative for the FBI told the Washington Examiner that the bureau is “unable to comment on litigation” but that “the FBI is committed to fostering a work environment where all of our employees are valued and respected.”

“Diversity is one of our core values, and to effectively accomplish our mission of protecting the American people we need people of different genders, backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives,” the representative said.

The federal lawsuit filed by female former trainees in May is directed at the training policies at the FBI and the conduct of its instructors at its agent training facility in Quantico, Virginia. The lawsuit claims FBI training guidelines are “highly subjective” and that “the uneven power dynamic at the FBI Academy puts female trainees at a distinct disadvantage.” And the lawsuit claims the subjective guidelines lets instructors misrepresent scenarios and fail women.

The complaint also alleges that when one of the women told former FBI Director James Comey of the allegations, Comey denied that discriminatory behavior was occurring and “instead suggested she use her ‘pain’ to reflect on her strengths and weaknesses.”

Mark Morgan, a former deputy assistant director at the FBI and the new acting chief of Customs and Border Protection, is also mentioned in the lawsuit.

David Shaffer, the attorney for the plaintiffs, told the Washington Examiner the FBI Academy relies upon “a completely subjective system that allows instructors to give rise to their own biases and beliefs with no accountability and oversight.”

Shaffer said that a common dynamic is that when a female trainee explains or defends her actions to an instructor, she is viewed being argumentative while when a male trainee does he is seen as standing up for himself.

Statistics provided by the FBI show that 20% of the special agents who are brought into the FBI are female. For the 2019 cycle, the FBI says that women made up 32% of those in the special agent basic field training course and 36% of those who had applied to be special agents. The FBI says that its 2019 target for female applications had been 33%, and the numbers reflect improvements from the 26% of special agent applications in the 2018 cycle and 22% in the 2017 cycle.

The FBI says that the total number of those who make it through the entire FBI special agent process — including application, training, and graduation — has held steady at just 6%.

If the DOJ inspector takes up the issue of discrimination at Quantico, it wouldn’t be the first time. A 2003 inspector general report which looked into allegations of disciplinary double standards at the FBI uncovered instances of instructors making inappropriate comments towards some trainees.

When asked by the Washington Examiner whether the DOJ inspector general would be launching an inquiry following the request from congressional leaders, the watchdog office declined to say.

Shaffer said that an inspector general investigation “should be done of course,” but he said that Congress needed to take action too.

“They need to be doing their oversight of the agency and asking the hard questions — and not relying on the FBI to investigate themselves,” Shaffer said.

A government investigation found that Homeland Security mistakenly admitted some 'potentially high-risk' travelers into the Global Entry program,https://www.businessinsider.com,['Graham Rapier'],07-01-2019,2019,7,https://www.businessinsider.com/global-entry-program-admitted-potentially-high-risk-travelers-investigation-finds-2019-7,"An internal investigation by the Department of Homeland Security has found potentially significant flaws the Global Entry program that expedites the customs process for some international travelers arriving in the United States

According to a report by the DHS inspector general published the last week of June, US Customs and Border Protection's policies ""do not always prevent ineligible and potentially high-risk Global Entry members from obtaining expedited entry.""

In four cases, the investigation found that applicants were mistakenly considered low-risk and were approved for the program.

""This occurred because CBP officers did not always comply with policies when reviewing Global Entry applications nor do CBP's policies sufficiently help officers determine an applicant's level of risk,"" the partially redacted report said.

Additionally, the report found that some officers did not verify the receipts that Global Entry users receive from the program's kiosks when arriving in the country.

""Unless CBP officers authenticate kiosk receipts, someone could use a fake receipt to enter the United States,"" the inspector general wrote.

The agency suggested six fixes to shore up the program's security

In response to its findings, the report made six suggestions to close the loopholes and help maintain the $89 million Global Entry program's continued security.

Those recommendations include a new oversight of CBP officers at enrollment centers as well as ports of entry, analyzing the flaws outlined in their findings, updating the program handbook, and adding more self-inspection sheets for employees to monitor the program.

""Strengthening controls will help ensure compliance with policies and procedures, as well as effective operations,"" the report said. ""Until CBP addresses the vulnerabilities we identified, individuals intending to do harm or carry out criminal activities may exploit Global Entry.""

Crop Conditions Still Lag,https://www.agriculture.com,[],07-01-2019,2019,7,https://www.agriculture.com/news/crops/crop-conditions-still-lag,"DES MOINES, Iowa -- Most of the corn and 92% of soybeans grown in the major producing states are now planted, with 94% of corn and 83% of soybeans emerged, according to the USDA’s weekly Crop Progress Report released Monday. But the condition of the corn crop varies widely.

Corn

The overall condition of the corn crop is about the same as last week—with 56% rated good to excellent in the top 18 corn producing states. Corn rated excellent jumped up by only one percentage point – to 9%. The trade expected an improvement in conditions from last week. One year ago, 76% of the corn crop was considered in good to excellent condition.

(Today’s U.S.-level report from the National Agricultural Statistics Service is no longer reporting corn planting progress, normally an indication that it’s nearly complete. But that’s not the case at the state level. Illinois reports 95% of corn planted as of June 30. Indiana reports corn planting “all but wrapped up for the season” but no number, and Ohio reports 91% of corn planted.)

Conditions in the eastern Corn Belt may have deteriorated. As of Sunday, Ohio’s corn was rated 31% good to excellent, down from 39% last week. Indiana corn is 39% good to excellent, down from 43%; Illinois is 42% good to excellent, down from 47%. Iowa’s crop improved slightly, from 62% good to excellent a week earlier to 64%. Nebraska corn is among the best, with 74% rated good to excellent, down slightly from 77% last week.

Soybeans

The nation’s crop is rated 54% good/excellent, unchanged from last week but below 71% at this time last year.

This crop, too, varies widely in condition. In Nebraska, it’s rated 74% good/excellent. Ohio’s bean crop is only 28% good to excellent; 23% (more than any other state) gets a poor rating.

Wheat

The winter wheat harvest is now 30% complete vs. a 48% five-year average for this time of year. As would be expected, Texas is nearing completion, with 81% harvested vs. an 82% average."
VA Secretary Robert Wilkie reflects on a year spent trying to fix his vital but troubled agency,https://www.wcpo.com,[],07-01-2019,2019,7,https://www.wcpo.com/news/our-community/homefront/va-secretary-robert-wilkie-reflects-on-a-year-spent-trying-to-fix-the-va-hows-it-going-so-far,"Listen to this episode of Homefront in the podcast player above

CINCINNATI — In the 11 months since Robert Wilkie became United States Secretary of Veterans Affairs, he’s booted medical directors from their roles, visited individual VA centers to assess their weaknesses and created history by requesting and receiving the largest-ever budget for his department: $220 billion.

The problems facing the VA as he entered it were numerous and well-documented — long wait times for appointments, allegations of misconduct, overprescription of opioids, a poor work environment and improperly kept records that led to delayed GI payments, to name a handful of the most prominent. Many still linger.

However, during a recent visit to Cincinnati, Wilkie said the agency’s approval ratings are rising as it takes a series of new approaches to fight its longtime bugbears.

“Most of the issues in the VA — not here in Cincinnati — have nothing to do with the technical competence of the employees,” he said. “It had everything to do with leadership walking the post.”

As the face of new leadership, Wilkie has overseen the implementation of the MISSION Act, which allows veterans to see pre-screened private practitioners if their local VA is more than a 30-minute drive from home or if the soonest available appointment time (for primary and mental health care) is more than 20 days away. For services falling under the umbrella of ""specialty care,"" veterans can see a community health care provider if their VA is over an hour away or the nearest available appointment is not within 28 days.

Wait times differ from need to need, but the average number of days elapsed between a request and appointment is 12 in Cincinnati, according to Wilkie. It’s 39 at the clinic in Hamilton.

“MISSION was designated to make sure those numbers did not affect the veteran’s health,” Wilkie said.

He also hopes to deal more effectively than his predecessors with issues such as mental illness and addiction, he added. Although Wilkie has in other interviews partially attributed the high rate of veteran suicide to veterans not being in contact with their local VA, he acknowledged the agency’s responsibility to provide better-quality services and outreach. He’s invested $9 billion this year — more than any year before — in improving those aspects of the agency.

“We are not even at the Sputnik stage in this country when it comes to getting our arms around mental health issues,"" he said at the National Coalition for Homeless Veterans conference in late May.

He echoed that statement during his trip to Cincinnati, noting that providing nuanced mental health care has practical benefits alongside humanitarian ones.

“This is not a draftee army anymore,” he said. “These are all volunteers, and you have to take better care of them than you did in the draftee days, where it didn’t matter what the individual soldiers did (because) there were 10 coming in to replace them on any day.”

Only comprehensive culture change can be the real answer, he added. That could take a significant amount of time, and it means focusing on more than suicide prevention. It means emphasizing wellness, exploring supplemental forms of treatment such as yoga and training veterans to look out for one another.

Mental health should be a significant element of veterans’ everyday care, he said. And everyone else’s, too.

If that $9 billion is spent wisely, Wilkie said he thinks it’s possible the VA could lead the conversation on effective psychiatric treatment in the United States.

“We have a community-based system here,” he said. “We have a culture that promotes communication, and what I see across the country — today, sadly, the fourth new York City policeman (in three weeks) has sadly taken his life. We’ve seen suicide among teenagers spiking. So it’s not just veterans. It’s the entire country that needs to be brought into this.”

Despite years of setbacks, many of which still weigh on his agency, Wilkie said he has generally witnessed encouraging progress since he assumed his post in June 2018.

He hopes to see much more ahead.

“Most of my professional and political career, the VA has always been 16 or 17 out of 17 in terms of best places in the government to work,” he said. “We’re No. 6 now and will likely be higher when the next ratings come out. So (those are) incredible steps forward, and I think it’s incumbent upon me, as someone who comes from the military — I was working for General Mattis when this offer came — to tell that story and encourage veterans to use the VA.

“This is a home for them with people who have served.”"
Fresh leadership churn at DHS agencies,https://thehill.com,[],06-30-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/policy/national-security/450970-fresh-leadership-churn-at-dhs-agencies,"The leadership carousel at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) took another spin this week as the agency underwent fresh changes among officials tasked with enforcing immigration law.

Roughly 10 weeks after a purge of DHS leaders that included former Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen Kirstjen Michele NielsenThe Hill's Morning Report - Trump touts handshake with Kim, tariff freeze with Xi Fresh leadership churn at DHS agencies Booker calls for hearings on reports of ICE using solitary confinement MORE, the acting head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) abruptly resigned and the agency announced a new head of Customs and Border Protection (CBP).

And there are rumblings that acting DHS Secretary Kevin McAleenan is not on solid ground. Some of President Trump Donald John TrumpThe billionaire exemption Former Bolton aide pushes back on report of nuclear freeze with North Korea US breaks record for longest economic expansion MORE’s allies and outside groups that favor stricter immigration laws are expressing frustration with McAleenan, suggesting further changes could be on the horizon as the president seeks to implement the right mix of loyalists and immigration hardliners to implement his agenda heading into 2020.

""I've made changes — very good changes,"" Trump told reporters this past week. ""We're moving some people around into different locations.""

McAleenan announced this week that Mark Morgan, previously the acting director of ICE, would move over to lead CBP in the wake of John Sanders's resignation.

Morgan, who led Border Patrol during the Obama administration, made clear in an interview with The Hill earlier this month that he intended to carry out Trump's policies.

Replacing Morgan at ICE is Matthew Albence, a 25-year law enforcement veteran who has held various roles in the Trump administration since 2017.

The president said he was aware there would be a change when Sanders announced his CBP resignation. But Trump did not say whether he asked Sanders to step down, and Sanders did not provide a reason for his resignation.

""I don’t know anything about it,"" Trump said Tuesday. ""I hear he's a very good man. I hear he's a good person. I don’t know him. I don’t think I ever spoke to him.""

Morgan and Albence's appointments follow Trump tapping Ken Cucinelli, an immigration hardliner and former Virginia attorney general, as the acting head of U.S. Customs and Immigration Services.

Trump also announced former ICE Director Tom Homan would return to the administration as ""border czar."" Homan has appeared regularly on Fox News to defend the president's policies, but it's unclear if or when he might return to government work or what his duties would entail.

Homan was sharply critical this week of McAleenan, suggesting he has not been supportive of Trump's agenda and has hindered ICE from doing its job.

The White House did not respond to questions about the recent shakeup at DHS, including whether Trump ordered the personnel changes.

The latest reshuffling came as House Democrats clashed over a bill to provide additional border funding and as Democratic presidential candidates made the treatment of migrants a central tenet of the party’s first two debates.

The president has often argued that congressional inaction is largely to blame for the surge in border apprehensions and poor humanitarian conditions for migrants. But the recent turnover atop DHS suggests growing impatience with that agency as well.

Any frustration by Trump with the agency’s performance could prove problematic for McAleenan.

Multiple advocates for Trump view McAleenan as a placeholder and have criticized him in recent weeks for failing to aggressively pursue the president's immigration priorities.

""He just basically has been a stumbling block for basically any enforcement that either CBP or ICE or USCIS wanted to do,"" said Rosemary Jenks, director of government relations for the immigration reduction group NumbersUSA.

DHS did not respond to a request for comment.

The Washington Post reported this month that McAleenan was uneasy with Trump's call for mass ICE raids to round up migrant families with deportation orders. McAleenan was said to have favored a more targeted approach.

Trump on June 22 postponed the raids for ""two weeks"" to give Congress time to attempt to pass legislation overhauling the country's asylum laws.

McAleenan denied in an interview with Fox News Radio on Thursday that he was the source of leaks to the media that jeopardized the raids, but wouldn’t say explicitly if there were any Trump policies that he disagreed with.

“That's not my role. I'm an operator, I'm a law enforcement professional, the president sets policy and we implement,” McAleenan said. “We implement in the best way we know how based on our operational experience.”

The White House did not respond to a request for comment about whether Trump planned to nominate the acting secretary for the role full-time.

Ur Jaddou, who was chief counsel to USCIS during the Obama administration, told The Hill that McAleenan's job has been complicated by the consistent turnover within his department.

""To have people at the top constantly changing and changing their direction on policy and how to approach things is completely disruptive which is why I call it chaos,"" she said in an interview.

Jaddou said she could not recall any comparable amount of turnover to what has taken place at DHS in recent months.

Andrew R. Arthur, who served in the former Immigration and Naturalization Service during the Clinton and George W. Bush administrations, was complimentary of McAleenan but was unsure of his long-term role. He described McAleenan as a ""very competent administrator"" and noted his wealth of experience from leading CBP.

McAleenan has been under additional scrutiny this past week as concerns over the administration's treatment of migrants gained a new sense of urgency.

Hundreds of children were moved from a detention facility in Texas after the Associated Press reported on poor conditions, including kids taking care of other kids and a lack of sanitation.

That same week, a photo went viral of a man and his daughter who drowned while trying to cross the Rio Grande River. Democrats seized on the image to decry the Trump administration's policies.

""In another administration an acting secretary would be out immediately,"" Jaddou said of the response to the photo. ""The person would not survive more than a day.""

McAleenan addressed the photo in a press conference Friday, calling the incident tragic and devastating, but deflected blame away from his own agency.

""This failure is not on the men and women of DHS, and definitely not on the outstanding border patrol agents, and CBP officers and ICE officers who have borne the brunt to the challenges and most of the criticism,"" he said.

McAleenan expressed appreciation for Congress for passing a funding package that includes $4.5 billion in resources for agencies responding to the influx of migrants.

Many Democrats panned the final version of the bill, saying it did not do enough to protect migrant children.

Still, McAleenan said the onus is on Congress to take further action, and he urged lawmakers to close immigration loopholes and approve changes to asylum laws.

""This situation should not be acceptable to any of us,"" McAleenan said. ""It should galvanize action and real debate based on what is actually happening on the border and why. And yet, here in Washington, we have collectively failed to act to address the drivers of the crisis."""

Mark Sersansie might be forgiven for often looking over his shoulder.

Derika Moses’ Los Angeles Superior Court case

It soon became apparent, Sersansie says, that unsavory things were happening.

Sersansie found his way to Bill Reynolds, an insurance fraud investigator who had been probing the scam since 2009. They worked with authorities and, in 2012, filed what’s known as a qui tam lawsuit — a type of whistleblower suit brought under the False Claims Act that rewards whistleblowers when the government recovers funds lost to fraud.

‘Lives at risk’

Originally filed under seal, the qui tam lawsuit was brought “to stop rampant insurance fraud achieved through the unlawful employment of ‘runners, cappers and steerers,’ overbilling, illegal kickbacks to doctors, and counterfeiting of medical implant hardware perpetrated by Defendant Hospitals and their surgeons, spinal surgery hardware distributors, and healthcare ‘marketers’ in the area of spinal fusion surgeries,” the suit says.

The unlawful scheme cheated the California Workers’ Compensation System, Medi-Cal and private insurers out of hundreds of millions of dollars, the suit alleges.

“This scheme has led to patients receiving dangerous medical implants that have a substantial likelihood of failure. Many patients received spinal fusion surgeries that utilized counterfeit screws and rods, placing patients’ lives at risk, and subjecting them to further surgeries to replace the counterfeit hardware.”

Sersansie and Reynolds provided a trove of nonpublic evidence, and say they are gratified that the Department of Justice pursued the insurance fraud angle so aggressively. Operation Spinal Cap targets a scheme that stretched over 15 years and generated nearly $1 billion in fraudulent claims to the federal and state governments, as well as to private insurers. The U.S. Department of Justice says it involved some $40 million in illegal kickbacks to doctors, chiropractors, marketers and other medical professionals.

But they are perplexed — and disturbed — that the counterfeit hardware assertions have been ignored.

“This stuff went all the way across the United States and, in my opinion, is a threat to public safety,” Reynolds said.

Reynolds found himself out of a job not long after he suggested that insurers should cover surgeries to have suspect hardware extracted, he said. And Sersansie said he and his family have suffered serious harassment and intimidation.

But neither has regrets. Many patients became addicted to pain pills after their operations, and many overdosed, they said.

“People are dying and no one’s doing anything,” Sersansie said. “Why aren’t these guys indicted? There are thousands of patients out there who aren’t getting help. The insurance carriers object to paying to reverse the surgery.

“I just want some justice for these people. They’re in pain. They deserve some relief.”

Follow-up

So whose job is it — if anyone’s — to tease out this piece of the puzzle?

The company accused in lawsuits of mixing genuine spinal hardware with cheap copies — Spinal Solutions in Murrieta — is now defunct.

A state inspection report of Spinal Solutions’ Murrieta office and stockroom from 2012 found disarray, including incomplete records and a failure “to properly maintain and document the device history of each spinal fixation system kit.” But officials with the California Department of Public Health say that the federal Department of Justice and the FBI took the lead in investigating the allegations.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said it acted on tips received. It inspected Spinal Solutions’ Murrieta office and warehouse 10 times in 2011, finding unlabeled products and disorganization, according to documents released under the Freedom of Information Act.

The FDA issued a warning letter to Roger Williams and Spinal Solutions in 2012 “regarding the adulteration of certain spinal implant systems,” and sent a list of “objectionable conditions” witnessed by FDA inspectors, including a lack of adequate quality control procedures and device history records, spokeswoman Alison Hunt said by email.

Spinal Solutions completed a low-severity recall of some product due to a lack of labeling and use instructions in 2013, records show. The company shut down, and owner Williams filed for bankruptcy that same year.

To many, that doesn’t seem like enough. “There were a couple of people who put the FDA on the scent early on,” said Berger, the attorney for Reynolds and Sersansie. “They did a couple of visits to the facility, they sent warning letters about the storage process not being up to par, but they didn’t drill down on the counterfeit aspect.

“Why? That’s been a huge question in my mind for many years.”

Reynolds, the fraud investigator, has a simple theory. “The U.S. attorney took the path of least resistance,” he said. “And now these people in Wisconsin, in Texas, are walking around with time bombs in their bodies and they don’t even know it.”

The DOJ said it has been doggedly pursuing the criminal threads in this case. Assertions about criminal counterfeiting of hardware, when the hardware is in people’s bodies and record-keeping is as haphazard as it’s apparently been, are difficult to prove beyond reasonable doubt in court — and are beyond the scope of the criminal proceedings, court filings assert.

A federal judge said that, because of the complexity of restitution, civil litigation may provide a more appropriate remedy for victims.

In recent weeks, a patient in Wisconsin said he was contacted by an FDA criminal investigator. But, as a matter of longstanding policy, the FDA said it does not confirm or deny the existence of criminal investigations.

A waiting game

And so, they wait. And wonder.

Donald Harland lives in Wisconsin. He worked as a caregiver for a man who was 6-foot-4 and about 400 pounds. Harland was trying to help the man to his feet back in 2008 when the man slipped; Harland had to use all his strength to ensure that the man didn’t fall.

“I held my ground, holding him up, and then I heard a pop in my back,” he said. “I knew something was terribly wrong.”

Excruciating pain followed. Harland was told that surgery could offer relief. And it has been agony ever since.

Harland’s surgeon went to prison on unrelated health care fraud charges in 2014. But several of the surgeon’s former patients received letters from the hospital where their surgeries were performed in 2015, informing them of the counterfeit hardware concerns.

Record-keeping issues, and the apparent mix of genuine and other product, make it hard for people to know exactly what’s inside them, giving them doubts about any reassuring news.

“Like you, through recent news reports, Aurora Health Care was made aware of a lawsuit involving former medical device distributor Spinal Solutions,” said the letter to Jean Morin of Racine. “The lawsuit alleges that from 2007 to 2012, Spinal Solutions produced ‘counterfeit’ implantable hardware that was mixed in with genuine product. …

“Although we are able to identify the patients, such as yourself, who had surgeries involving Spinal Solutions hardware, based on the documentation we have, it is not possible to determine if any of those parts might have been the hardware referenced in the lawsuit,” the letter said.

Patients of former surgeon Cully White have formed a Facebook group to share information. Harland has finally found a surgeon willing to extract his hardware — but it’s unclear if his spine would be strong enough to support his weight without it.

“I’m trying not to let fear stop me,” Harland said.

Meantime, in California, the U.S. Department of Justice persuaded the court to freeze action on the civil lawsuits, so as not to interfere with its criminal investigation. And people remain in pain.

“I’ve spent five years trying to identify my screws,” said Joshua Lash, a former Los Angeles deputy sheriff. “I can’t. I have no idea what’s going on inside me.”

Lash, of San Bernardino, said his career was crushed by spinal surgery he never wanted. He still has pain at the incision site. He’s always dropping things. The simple act of sneezing causes agony.

“Unfortunately, the U.S. Attorney’s Office only focused on the fraud, not on the patients,” he said. “The FDA has been quite quiet, and hasn’t done anything to support us.

“There is something wrong with me,” said Lash, gazing thin-lipped at the X-ray of the screws embedded into his bone. “I need to get this stuff out. But I no longer trust doctors.”"
"EPA's backward accounting protects polluters, not the people",https://thehill.com,[],07-01-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/opinion/energy-environment/451212-epas-backward-accounting-protects-polluters-not-the-people,"Cost-benefit analysis. It’s an idea originally promoted by industry lobbyists to push regulatory agencies to tot up the costs and benefits of safeguards for health, safety, and the environment, after first translating them into dollars-and-cents terms. Industry’s goal was to delay and weaken public protections while cloaking the effort in a veil of arithmetic precision.

In 1981, the Reagan administration was only too happy to take up the cost-benefit cause, enshrining the idea in an executive order. The tortured process of weighing Americans’ health and lives against industry profit routinely understated the benefits of environmental, health and safety protections and overstated the costs of industry compliance. As a result, regulatory safeguards were frequently watered down or squelched.

Then a funny thing started happening. Even when working within this industry-rigged system, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) found that the monetary benefits of some of our most important public health and environmental rules far exceeded their costs.

ADVERTISEMENT

How did this happen? The EPA has gotten better at accounting for the benefits of addressing two specific harms — particulate matter and climate disruption — because of significant advances in the relevant fields of science and environmental economics. We now know that particulate pollution — fine particles suspended in the air we breathe — kills people. Similarly, we’re already getting a taste of how bad unchecked climate disruption will be for everyone.

Because the harms of particulate matter and climate disruption are so great, the benefits of addressing them turn out to be worth a lot of money. Consequently, when proposed regulations have a positive effect on climate or particular matter, the calculable benefits go up, even for rules that aren’t aimed directly at either.

While industry has dressed its support of cost-benefit analysis in the garb of “sound policymaking,” its real motivation has always been evading the costs of cleaning up its pollution. Polluters banked on the EPA and other agencies never being able to measure the vast majority of benefits in dollar terms (things like saving human lives and preventing cancer). Now that science and more accurate accounting have disrupted their game, they’re demanding their friends at the Trump EPA change the rules — again.

In response, EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler Andrew WheelerOvernight Energy: Top EPA official stepping down amid ethics probe | Critics slam EPA for rolling back union protections | Trump officials open door to controversial Alaska mining project Top EPA official stepping down amid ethics probe Trump pick brings scrutiny to 'revolving door' between Pentagon, industry MORE and his departing air quality deputy Bill Wehrum — both former industry lobbyists — have commenced work on a “benefits-busting” project that would re-rig the cost-benefit game in industry’s favor. In May, Wheeler directed each of the agency’s program offices to launch formal rulemakings that would overhaul how they perform cost-benefit analyses on future rules. Before resigning, Wehrum set the agency’s air office to writing the first of these proposals. (This appears to be one of Wehrum’s last official acts before leaving the agency under an ethics cloud.)

Particulate matter and climate are likely to be the main targets of Wehrum’s swan song. The proposal will likely jettison particulate matter from many cost-benefit calculations by changing how the agency treats “co-benefits” — those that a rule produces even though they are not its principal objective. Since particulate matter is a byproduct of burning fossil fuels, any regulation that limits these activities saves lives by reducing particulate emissions. Barring co-benefits from the equation or establishing arbitrary limits on their consideration flies in the face of well-established economics, sound science and common sense.

ADVERTISEMENT

On climate, the proposal will likely formalize the Trump administration’s efforts to gut the Obama-era social cost of carbon (SCC), an attempt to put a value on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The Obama administration set the SCC at about $45 per ton of carbon dioxide (though some economists would put it much higher, at over $1,000). The Trump EPA has proposed using a SCC as low as $1 per ton by disregarding harms U.S. emissions cause to other countries and future generations.

The Trump EPA is already relying on these head-in-the-sand accounting tactics to justify rolling back some of the agency’s most important environmental and public health rules. By writing these tricks into a binding benefits-busting rule, EPA would hobble future efforts to protect public health and the environment. Indeed, this will be a powerful tool for polluters in defeating air pollution safeguards.

The American public deserves honest accounting. Congress should conduct vigorous oversight of the Trump EPA’s efforts to transform the implementation of bedrock laws like the Clean Air Act into a loaded dice game in which public health and the environment always lose.

Attorney General William Barr on Friday declared a public-safety emergency in Alaska so the Justice Department could allocate more than $10 million toward fighting violent crime in some of the state’s rural communities.

In many areas, getting timely law enforcement responses to sexual assaults, child abuse and other violent crimes can be difficult.

ALASKA SUPREME COURT RULES STATE SEX OFFENDER REGISTRY LAW CALLED UNCONSTITUTIONAL

A 2013 federal report said that at least 75 Alaska Native communities had no law enforcement officers. Tribes have lacked authority to establish police forces since the 1971 Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act took effect, Reuters reported.

Because of Alaska’s immense size (663,268 square miles) it can sometimes take hours for state troopers to reach a village from which a crime is reported.

Tribal leaders have told authorities that victims of sexual assault sometimes need to take boats or planes to reach medical facilities in more populated areas, the Associated Press reported.

Barr visited Alaska in late May to get a sense of the problems Alaskans have been dealing with.

“In May, when I visited Alaska, I witnessed firsthand the complex, unique, and dire law enforcement challenges the state of Alaska and its remote Alaska Native communities are facing,” Barr said in a Justice Department statement. “With this emergency declaration, I am directing resources where they are needed most and needed immediately, to support the local law enforcement response in Alaska Native communities, whose people are dealing with extremely high rates of violence.”

Barr and other officials visited the communities of Galena, Bethel and Napaskiak on May 31, the Anchorage Daily News reported.

Alaskan members of Congress said they were pleased by the attention Barr was directing toward their state.

Elizabeth Warren says no wealthy donors as ambassadors in State plan,https://www.vox.com,['Jun'],06-28-2019,2019,6,https://www.vox.com/2019/6/28/19102522/elizabeth-warren-state-department-plan-2020,"Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) just released her vision for how she would run the State Department from the Oval Office — and it’s a dramatic change from how President Donald Trump has handled America’s diplomatic corps.

In a Friday Medium post, Warren vowed to pursue a “diplomacy-first strategy” as president as opposed to conducting US foreign policy mostly through the better-funded Pentagon. To do that, she says, her administration would invest much more in the current and future diplomats that serve in roughly 270 posts around the world.

“American security and prosperity depend on robust diplomacy,” she wrote. “Our diplomats are the front line of our engagement with the world.”

Her piece details that she won’t allow wealthy campaign donors to become ambassadors, how she aims to double the size of the diplomatic corps while improving diversity in its ranks, and how she’d create a diplomatic equivalent of ROTC programs in universities, among other moves.

It makes sense for Warren to put out a vision like this. First, having a plan for every aspect of governance is kind of her thing. Second, her overall foreign policy views prioritize diplomacy over using the military. And third, the Trump administration has caused much heartburn at the State Department by proposing lower budgets and failing to nominate qualified people for key positions, although that’s starting to change.

But because it’s a relatively short Medium post, the senator’s State Department plan is lacking many details about how, exactly, she would turn her aspirations into reality. There’s no mention about how she’d fight a GOP-led Senate to spend more and confirm nominees, there’s no real connection (yet) with how these views intersect with her thoughts on defense and development, and no discussion of tradeoffs she might face while prioritizing the State Department’s revamp.

Still, offering a State Department plan makes her the leading candidate on the issue during the 2020 cycle (for now). And what she offers are some concrete proposals that would let Warren put her mark on one of America’s oldest governmental professions.

How Warren wants to fix the State Department

Warren’s plan comes down to three main proposals that, if enacted, would substantially change the way the State Department has been managed under Trump — and that represent something of a departure from how the department was run under President Barack Obama, too.

1) No wealthy donors become ambassadors

This is likely the part of Warren’s plan that will get the most attention. There’s a long tradition of presidents in both parties nominating some of their richest financial supporters to plum ambassadorial posts. In Obama’s second term, for example, he named 31 campaign “bundlers” — people who raised at least $50,000 for his campaign — as an embassy’s top diplomat.

“Nearly all of these bundlers ... serve in Western European nations or other highly developed and stable countries such as Canada and New Zealand,” the Center for Public Integrity reported in January 2017.

Trump continued the practice by nominating 14 inauguration donors — who gave on average about $350,000 — as ambassadors. What’s worse, the people he nominated for top embassy posts were less qualified than in administrations past, as the February chart from Axios below shows. (The nominated ambassadors also gave more money to his campaign, on average, than previous rich donors gave other presidents.)

Warren says that trend would end under her watch. “I’ll make my ambassadorial appointments based on only one thing: finding the most qualified person for the job,” she wrote. “I won’t give ambassadorial posts to wealthy donors or bundlers — period,” she continued, calling on other candidates to promise the same.

That said, it’s somewhat easy for Warren to make this pledge. She’s already not taking money from high rollers or speaking at big fundraisers, so her bench of wealthy supporters is already thin. Still, her vow, if enacted, would end a long-standing problem of pay-for-play at some of America’s most important embassies.

2) Revamp the diplomatic corps

Warren blames Trump for many diplomats recently leaving the government, but she also notes that’s been a problem for a while. “Years of hiring freezes and spending cuts have caused many talented diplomats to head for the doors,” she wrote.

So Warren proposes two ways to change that: double the size of the foreign service and improve the diversity in the diplomatic corps.

Those go hand in hand. Right now, America’s diplomats are mainly white and male. “[T]he Foreign Service is not sufficiently representative of the American people with respect to race, gender, socioeconomic background, and regional origin,” a May 2018 Congressional Research Service report noted.

That means there’s a vast, untapped pool of people around the country that may be interested in a diplomatic posting. To reach out to them, Warren says she’ll “dedicate recruiting resources to applicants from HBCUs [historically black colleges and universities] and other minority-serving institutions, women’s colleges, and community colleges. And I’ll double the size of fellowships designed to recruit minority and low-income diplomats.”

She’ll also push for universities to have a ROTC-like program for diplomats as well as double the size of the Peace Corps.

Trump, meanwhile, has consistently proposed cuts to the State Deparment budget and recruited secretaries of state that seem intent on lowering diplomatic ranks. Multiple diplomats I’ve talked to since the start of this administration have consistently noted the poor morale among the corps and just how understaffed — and therefore overworked — they all are.

Warren’s changes, then, will certainly require tons of effort and a decent chunk of money (although surely a lot, lot less than the Pentagon spends). It’s unlikely she could completely alter the face of the US diplomatic corps in four or even eight years. But she seems intent on making structural tweaks quickly in hopes of long-term change.

3) Improve the lives of diplomats

Diplomats have to deal with two big institutional challenges. First, they work for a large, impersonal bureaucracy that doesn’t always let the best talent rise to the top. Second, their service in major cities around the world makes it harder to raise a family and strike a normal work-life balance.

Warren wants to alter all that.

She proposes creating a “core professional development curriculum” which would help diplomats improve in their jobs and prepare for more senior roles. That will help her make at least one Deputy Secretary — a position right under the secretary of state — a career ambassador, one of the corps’ top designations.

The senator also aims to “enhance workplace flexibility to retain a diverse workforce.” She’d do that, in part, by “expanding parental leave and preferential postings for new parents.” That means new mothers and fathers wouldn’t be penalized as much for starting a family in the hyper-competitive State Department. What’s more, raising a kid in a more developed country could make an upbringing easier than, say, growing up in a warzone.

None of this is to say Warren’s plan is perfect; no plan is. But even in a short Medium post, Warren has given more thought about what to do with the State Deparment than many (if not all) of her Democratic opponents.

“It’s become clear that over the past three weeks since the administration reached a new agreement with Mexico that we’ve seen a substantial increase in the number of interdictions on the Mexican southern border, and a sincere effort to address the transportation networks coming through Mexico,” Acting Secretary Kevin McAleenan told reporters.

DEMS RUN LEFT ON IMMIGRATION: DEBATE FEATURES VOWS OF HEALTH CARE FOR UNDOCUMENTED, DEPORTATION CURBS

The U.S. and Mexico reached agreement this month on a deal that sees Mexico take “unprecedented steps to increase enforcement to curb irregular migration” in exchange for the U.S. dropping proposed sanctions on Mexican imports.

McAleenan said the U.S. was looking to see Mexico increase its deployment of National Guard members to the border, and for the expansion of the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) -- which allow for illegal immigrants to be returned to Mexico while their immigration proceedings are held.

""These initiatives are making an impact and we are now anticipating a significant reduction in border crossing numbers from June, as much as 25 percent when compared to the record level in May,” he said.

Customs and Border Protection said that it encountered more than 144,000 migrants at the border in May, a 30 percent increase from the prior month and double the influx recorded at the beginning of the year. NBC News reports that in 2018 there was a 17 percent decrease from May to June.

McAleenan also said the U.S. is working with Northern Triangle countries to deal with root causes of the migration crisis and increase efforts to tackle organized smuggling organizations in the region.

His remarks come a day after the House passed the Senate version of a $4.5 humanitarian aid bill. It passed after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi backed down from a push to include restrictions on immigration enforcement that could have scuttled the measure. Trump is expected to sign the bill early next week.

McAleenan thanked congressional leaders for getting the bill passed, and said that while it didn’t include everything DHS wanted in it -- specifically Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention beds for single adults -- it “substantially addresses” the request for funding.

He also took issue with media reports that children at detention centers were not being given vital supplies while in detention, leading to an outcry from lawmakers on Capitol Hill about alleged conditions at the centers. He said that while he has testified for months about concerns over the ability of DHS to handle the vast number of migrants crossing the border, those calls received little attention. But he said that some reports were ""missing the story.""

""Contrary to the reporting, children in CBP custody at the border are receiving access to key supplies, including toothbrushes, appropriate meals, blankets, showers as soon as they can be provided, and medical screening,"" McAleenan said."

Amid all the turmoil, some appropriators wonder whether the differences in the Democratic caucus are becoming too wide to bridge.

""I mean, you saw what happened in the border supplemental,” said Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-Texas), an appropriator on the Homeland Security subcommittee.

“There was no money for detention beds, there was no money for deportation, but people were afraid anytime they saw the word ICE,"" he said, referring to the position of progressives who remained dissatisfied with the bill.

On the other hand, Cuellar argued, moderates and red state Democrats did not want to seem soft on immigration, which could hurt their reelection chances.

Democrats would have an easier time passing the bill alongside other must-pass spending bills, Cuellar said, citing the strategy used to pass the Defense spending bill in the same group as the Labor, Health and Human Services, Education bill.

“My understanding is it's going to be difficult to go by itself. Not impossible, but difficult,” Cuellar said. “Because, you know, there's some extreme positions, so the best way is to pass it is to put it as part of a package.”

But Democrats have already passed 10 of the 12 appropriations bills, leaving only the largely non-controversial Legislative Branch bill as a possible partner. That measure was separated from an earlier package when controversy erupted over whether to increase congressional pay.

One potential option would be to tie the DHS bill to the defense authorization, but it’s unusual to pair spending bills with authorizing measures.

As of now, Democrats have no plans to put the DHS bill on the floor, according to a Democratic aide, but they are intent to keep trying to win over the caucus.

Unlike the border supplemental, however, Democrats do not yet have to worry about their bill being overshadowed by a Senate compromise. The Senate has not introduced a single appropriations bill for fiscal year 2020.

But when it does, the DHS measure is sure to become a serious point of contention. In December, disagreements over that bill, and President Trump’s requested border wall funding, led to a 35-day shutdown, the longest in the country’s history."

By John Roach, AccuWeather staff writer June 28, 2019, 2:12:42 PM EDT



There were surprising numbers in the annual U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)/National Agriculture Statistics Service (NASS) acreage estimates for corn and soybeans released Friday.

Corn-planted area for all purposes in 2019 is estimated at 91.7 million, a 3% increase from last year. Soybean-planted area is estimated at 80 million acres, down 10% from last year.

However, the average estimate from industry analysts in advance for U.S. corn was 86.66 million, which is significantly lower than the survey's figures. Those estimates took into consideration the rain and flooding that has affected U.S. farmers this year.

For soybeans, the industry analysts' average estimate was 84.36, a higher estimate than the survey's data for soybeans.

“There’s a difference of opinion on what reality is,” said AccuWeather senior meteorologist Jason Nicholls. “The USDA just put out their opinion, but that’s not the opinion a lot of others have.”

It’s also inconsistent from previous USDA estimates, although this USDA/NASS survey is separate and independent from the USDA’s own May and June estimates. The USDA estimated corn planted acreage at 92.8 and then 89.8 in May and June, respectively.

For soybean planted acreage, the USDA in both May and June estimated 84.6 million acres.

For comparison, in 2018 there were 89.1 million acres of corn planted and 89.2 million acres of soybean planted.

Trump campaign looks to gain support with Latino voters despite president’s harsh approach to immigration,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Josh Dawsey', 'Reporter Covering The White House']",06-29-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-campaign-looks-to-gain-support-with-latino-voters-despite-presidents-harsh-approach-to-immigration/2019/06/29/41aa413e-9776-11e9-a027-c571fd3d394d_story.html,"Vice President Pence speaks during the launching of the “Latinos for Trump” coalition in Miami on Tuesday. (Cristobal Herrera/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock)

In an effort to buttress President Trump’s reelection chances, the Trump campaign is reaching out to an unlikely group: Latino and Hispanic voters.

In recent weeks, the campaign has made several hires to court these voters and placed targeted ads in Florida. Meanwhile, Trump conducted his first presidential interview with Spanish-language media giant Telemundo, and Vice President Pence flew to Miami on Tuesday to officially launch the “Latinos for Trump” coalition.

“All Americans everywhere draw inspiration from the Latino Americans’ steadfast love of liberty,” Pence said, appearing in front of a ballroom crowd.

The president’s aides and advisers said the effort to target Latino voters reflects the need to expand the president’s base of support beyond his most fervent backers to prevail again in key swing states such as Florida as well as a belief that Trump can make a compelling case based on the performance of the economy.

“It’s absolutely critical to his reelection to win over some Hispanic voters, and he can do it by being a little more open on some of these immigration issues. He doesn’t need a majority. He just needs to move the needle,” said Chris Ruddy, a longtime Trump friend. “He has too many people around him telling him to stick to the base when he owns the base.”

But Trump faces an enormous challenge given his fraught relationship with the Latino community that began when he launched his campaign in 2015 by disparaging Mexican immigrants and continues through his frequent warnings about the dangers posed by Central American migrants trying to enter the United States across the southern border.

For many of the president’s opponents, the outreach efforts are viewed as a cruel joke amid the backdrop of the humanitarian crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border, his harsh attacks on immigrants and threats of deportation. Melissa Mark-Viverito, the interim president of the liberal Latino Victory Fund, said she expects a record number of Latino voters to show up at the polls to cast their ballots against Trump.



“Every day, it’s an onslaught against our community. We know we’re under attack. We know nothing good is going to come out of a second term of this administration,” she said. “It’s a slap in our face.”

Polling released this week by Telemundo underscored the challenge facing the campaign in attracting Latino and Hispanic voters. In the key swing state of Florida, 34 percent of Hispanic voters would like to see Trump reelected, while 56 percent would prefer to replace him with a Democrat, according to the survey conducted by Mason-Dixon Strategies.

The numbers were even less favorable to Trump in other states, although they are mostly solid Democratic territories.

In California, 26 percent of Hispanic voters would like to see Trump reelected, while 66 percent would prefer a Democrat. In Texas, 25 percent would like to see him returned to office, while 69 percent want a Democrat. And in the New York metro area, 19 percent want Trump reelected, while 73 percent prefer a Democrat.

Trump won 28 percent of the Latino vote in 2016, compared with more than 40 percent for George W. Bush in 2004 — though he essentially matched Mitt Romney’s 2012 total.

About 29 million Latino voters are now registered to vote, and almost 12 million voted in the 2018 midterm elections, according to the Pew Research Center.

Trump’s supporters say the president should frame his message around the economy and national security. Hispanic unemployment is at historic lows, and campaign officials say many Hispanic voters even appreciate the president’s tough immigration rhetoric. They declined to show data supporting that assertion, and some of the campaign’s early data indicates the president is in a disappointing spot among Latino voters, according to campaign officials who were granted anonymity to discuss the issue.

The campaign on Wednesday bought two full-page ads in the Miami Herald and the Nuevo Herald, making an economic argument for “Latinos for Trump.”

The ads also argued a point campaign officials often make. “President Trump is clear on immigration: Millions have followed the law to come to America, new immigrants should too,” the ad read.

But even some of the president’s supporters are skeptical about the campaign’s ability to attract more Latino voters.

Al Zapanta, who leads the U.S.-Mexico Chamber of Commerce, said he supported Trump in 2016 and is helping lobby for passage of the recent trade deal struck with Mexico and Canada. He has recently visited the White House for meetings with senior officials, he said, but not the president.

“The Republican Party has really missed the opportunity to bring in the Hispanic and Latino vote,” Zapanta said. “The party still hasn’t decided they really want to make that a reality.”

Zapanta said he believed Trump could secure more support and hoped he would. “I haven’t seen at this point that focus,” he said.

Officials have been trying to sell donors on the idea that Trump can be more competitive with Latino voters, with campaign manager Brad Parscale saying during a recent presentation at the Willard Hotel that the campaign expected to secure more support from the community, according to people familiar with his remarks.

The campaign recently hired a coalitions director to build support among Latino communities, and it has hired a national press secretary to handle Latino members of the media. Hannah Castillo, the coalitions director, is expected to hire at least a dozen people, campaign officials said. About two dozen community and political leaders in Arizona, California, Florida, Nevada and other states are on board, according to the campaign.

Also on board is Alex Garcia, the RNC’s Latino outreach director in Florida in 2018, to lead the Trump campaign in the state. Advisers are building advertisements to target voters in Spanish, and they have targeted particular communities in Florida for messaging.

In Venezuela, Trump and his aides see policies that are appreciated by Cuban Americans — even though the effort to oust President Nicolás Maduro has stalled, and Trump has grown frustrated.

Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law, has cast his legal immigration plan as a messaging device to the Latino community, White House officials said. But the plan has picked up scant support while the president continues to use incendiary rhetoric.

Still, campaign aides said they believe there have been heartening signs. At an El Paso event, much of the crowd was Hispanic and in from New Mexico, officials said, giving the campaign hope they could play in a state where Trump lost by a large margin in 2016.

Ruddy said the campaign must do more to convince Latino news outlets to change coverage of Trump. “Only a handful of media outlets really control news to the Latino population, and they are almost entirely nonstop, anti-him,” he said.

Doug Deason, a prominent Trump donor, said he recently spoke with the president about Hispanic voters at the Trump International Hotel in Washington. Deason said he encouraged the president to occasionally tweet about how much he loves Hispanic voters and what he has done for them.

“They’re just concerned. Does he like us? So he needs to make it really clear. I told him, you have to let them know you love them,” Deason said. “I know you love them, but you have to let them know.”

Trump seemed surprised, he said.

“He was shocked to hear that,” Deason said. Trump, according to Deason, then turned to Kellyanne Conway, his former campaign manager and now a senior White House adviser, and said “You got that, Kellyanne?”

“She said, ‘Yes sir, I got it,’ ” Deason said.

Correction: An earlier version of this story innaccurately stated that Trump conducted his first presidential interview with Spanish-language media outlet Univision.

TRUMP DELAYS PLANNED ICE RAIDS TO SEE IF CONGRESS CAN SOLVE BORDER CRISIS

""My primary responsibility is the safety of the men and women who go out there every day to protect the American people. And so it's just not true."" — Kevin McAleenan, acting DHS secretary

McAleenan was accused last week of leaking plans for raids scheduled by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), a unit of the DHS, after supposedly expressing fierce opposition to the plan and allegedly ordering top officials to “stand down” on the operation.

The source also said Homeland Security officials had been planning the raids since April and that McAleenan had been opposed to the plans from the start.

McAleenan also denied that anyone in his office leaked the information after host Laura Ingraham pressed further, saying that as the operation date nears ""you have to push information out into the field.""

""So tonight you're saying these rumors are wrong false and you did not do that?"" Ingraham asked.

""Absolutely not,"" McAleenan responded.

The acting secretary also commented on the Democratic presidential candidates advocating for decriminalizing illegal border crossings, saying it would ""further undermine our efforts at the border"" and increase the numbers of those crossing the U.S.-Mexico border.

""Decriminalizing crossing between ports of entry when we know it's associated with criminal smugglers ... when they know they bring drugs behind those people that are crossing, it would just add to the problem,"" McAleenan said.

Roger Stone’s lawyers punch back at DOJ over charges of violating gag order,https://www.politico.com,['Darren Samuelsohn'],06-27-2019,2019,6,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/27/roger-stone-lawyer-gag-order-1386122,"Former Trump adviser Roger Stone's lawyers argued he was within his First Amendment rights with his social media activity. | Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images legal Roger Stone’s lawyers punch back at DOJ over charges of violating gag order

Roger Stone’s lawyers swung back Thursday at federal prosecutors accusing the longtime Donald Trump adviser of violating a court-imposed gag order that could send him to jail.

In an 11-page reply, Stone’s attorneys argued their client was well within his First Amendment rights when he recently posted several times on social media his criticism of the press coverage surrounding his case.

Story Continued Below

A federal judge in Washington D.C. ordered Stone in February to cease commenting about the charges he’s fighting — which center around allegedly making false statements to Congress, obstruction and witness tampering — so as to not destroy the possibility of a fair trial in his case later this fall.

But the U.S. attorney’s office that took over the prosecution originally brought by former special counsel Robert Mueller last week flagged several Stone Instagram posts, including some questioning why the press wasn’t paying more attention to his lawyers' recent legal filings.

Responding on Thursday, Stone’s lawyers argue that he has indeed respected the court’s order and that the posts in dispute “are not ‘statements’, nor do they pose a danger to the fair trial concern which was (and is) the constitutional raison d’etre of the Order.”

Stone’s lawyers questioned the government’s focus on three specific social media posts, which they say “exhibits a willful blindness to the tens of thousands of hostile-to-Stone articles which have been authored by others about the ‘investigation’ and Stone’s ‘case;’ articles, animated cartoons, comments, editorials, television and radio programs, panels, celebrity ‘dark comedy’ readings of the Special Counsel Report, and even a comedic portrayal of Roger Stone by Steve Martin on Saturday Night Live which satirically portrayed Stone as a caricature of himself.” The SNL skit has tallied more than 4.4 million views on YouTube, the attorneys noted.

“The ‘prejudice’ to be concerned about is prejudice against Stone; his lonely voice presents no threat to a fair trial under this Court’s supervision. Of more concern should be the Washington Post’s unrelenting coverage of Roger Stone,” his lawyers argued.

The Stone lawyers’ combative response to the alleged gag order violations marks a far different tone than the one the defense took the last time Stone found himself in trouble on the same issue. In February, Judge Amy Berman Jackson restricted Stone’s public speech after he posted a photo of her on social media with what looked like gun-sight crosshairs.

During a hearing on the matter where he also faced the prospect of jail time, Stone apologized for the post. ""I let you down,” he told Jackson. “I let myself down. I let my family down. I let my attorneys down. I can only say I'm sorry. It was a momentary lapse in judgment. Perhaps I talk too much.""

Jackson ended that hearing by expanding the gag order on Stone — originally, he was allowed to discuss his case, so long as it wasn’t in the immediate vicinity of the Washington D.C. courthouse where he’ll go on trial Nov. 5 — to cover all speech about the case. The judge, an appointee of President Barack Obama, also gave him an ultimatum. ""No, Mr. Stone, I'm not giving you another chance,"" she said. ""I have serious doubts about whether you've learned any lesson at all. It is my job to make sure this trial does not devolve into a circus.""

The latest posts to potentially land Stone in trouble center around messages asking why several major news organizations didn't cover a recent filing his lawyers made arguing that the government did not independently verify that Russian operatives hacked the Democratic National Committee in 2016. Stone posted several more articles touting his attorneys' work, tagging one, ""Funny, No @nytimes or @washingtonpost coverage of this development.""

Prosecutors have since filed a separate document refuting Stone's claims that the government didn't independently confirm that Russia was behind the DNC hack.

The government has also flagged a Stone comment, written on Instagram, about a May report in POLITICO describing Jackson's order to see an unredacted version of any still-secret portions of the Mueller report related to his case.

""The Judge has ruled but @Politico gets most of the story wrong because they are biased elitist snot-nosed fake news shitheads who's [sic] specialty is distortion by omitting key facts to create a false narrative. #rogerstonedidnothingwrong #rogerstone #fakenews,"" Stone's post said.

The Stone reply on Thursday argued that the at-issue posts only included headlines from other media backing up his arguments, but he never posted a link to the actual story. They explained that a Stone post from April that the government flagged to Jackson — drawing attention to a CNN story about the FBI refusing a public records request for emails to CNN — only raises a “rhetorical question.” And his post about the POLITICO story is simply criticism of that media outlet.

“The government’s offer of this posting reveals the government’s desire to tarnish Stone, not to try him here on the facts,” his attorneys wrote. “Stone’s language may be indecorous at times, but that does not obscure the content’s non-culpability under the Order. Criticism of the media is not a violation of the Order.”

More broadly, Stone’s attorneys argue that their client “is the most minor of participants” who generates far less media attention to his case compared with Mueller himself, Attorney General William Barr or many others pulled into the wider Russia probe.

“The 2,402 ‘likes’ of the June 18- 19 Stone postings are but a speck compared to the torrent of publicity, commentary and commotion generated by persons, publications and politicians over which, and over whom, Stone has no control,” his attorneys wrote. “Even witnesses who will be called to testify in this case are contributing to the cacophony.”

Here, the Stone attorneys cited Randy Credico, a New York-based political satirist and radio host whose contacts with WikiLeaks’ founder Julian Assange make him a central figure in the Stone case. Credico, named in the Stone indictment as one of the witnesses he attempted to intimidate, has said he’s received a subpoena to appear at the upcoming Stone trial.

Despite the defense’s unapologetic tone and the insistence that none of the Instagram posts ran afoul of Jackson’s gag order, the new filing indicates Stone has deleted the post attacking POLITICO as well as two of the other seven posts to which the government recently objected. No explanation was given for the deletions.

Jackson has yet to signal what her next steps will be — including possibly holding a public hearing — on the Stone gag order issue. In an order last Friday, she gave Stone’s attorneys until Thursday to file any response in writing “why the Court should not find that the defendant has violated the Court's order dated February 21, 2019 and his conditions of release.”

KC VA hospital head Kathleen Fogarty’s cover-up allegations,https://www.kansascity.com,[],,,,https://www.kansascity.com/news/business/health-care/article231768708.html,"Director of Kansas City VA Hospital has history of cover-ups from her previous job at Florida VA hospital Kathleen Fogarty, director of the Kansas City VA Hospital, has withheld information of a Veterans Affairs Police altercation with patient Dale Farhner, who died two days later. Up Next × SHARE COPY LINK Kathleen Fogarty, director of the Kansas City VA Hospital, has withheld information of a Veterans Affairs Police altercation with patient Dale Farhner, who died two days later.

The leader of the Kansas City VA Medical Center has been under fire for withholding information about a patient’s death, allegedly at the hands of Veterans Affairs Police.





That secrecy seems to be a pattern.

Years earlier, that leader, Kathleen Fogarty, was also accused of cover-ups at her previous job as head of a Tampa, Florida, VA hospital.

A patient’s daughter there dubbed her “the VA queen of cover-ups” in 2014, after Fogarty authorized staff to install a hidden camera in the patient’s room. Fogarty was also accused of cutting veterans’ access to care outside the VA system to save money and denying she was doing it.

The incidents raise new questions about her administration’s handling of the death of Dale Farhner in Kansas City.





Farhner, a 66-year-old veteran from Kingston, Missouri, had hernia surgery at the Kansas City VA hospital in May 2018. The surgical wound became infected, and he was driving himself to the hospital’s emergency room three days later when a VA police officer confronted him for driving the wrong way in the parking lot. The ensuing altercation left Farhner nearly comatose, according to internal VA documents leaked to USA Today. He died two days later, but the documents reportedly made no determination about whether his death was due to injuries inflicted by VA Police.

The Star learned about Farhner’s death last year through an anonymous tip and filed a Freedom of Information Act request that revealed that the VA has documents, audio and video related to the incident. But the VA has repeatedly refused to provide them — or any other any information about the incident — to The Star, to members of Congress and even to Farhner’s family, which has since filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the agency.

Randall Barnett, the president of Vietnam Veterans of America’s Kansas City branch, has said it smacks of another cover-up.

“If they weren’t at fault or didn’t feel through their investigation they were somewhat at fault, why would they cover everything up?” Barnett asked. “Or try to cover everything up?”

The Star asked to talk to Fogarty this past week about her time in Tampa and the Farhner incident, but Kansas City VA spokesman Vernon Stewart provided only written responses via email.

“Federal law enforcement officials have already fully investigated this matter and determined that VA acted appropriately in its interaction with the veteran,” Stewart said. “VA will cooperate fully with any additional official investigations.”

Hidden camera

According to an interview she gave with a Florida public radio station in 2015, Fogarty started her career as a dietitian at the Kansas City VA in 1986.

She rose through the ranks over several decades and in 2011 became director of the James A. Haley VA Medical Center in Tampa — one of the nation’s largest VA hospitals.

The hidden camera controversy struck soon after.

The incident centered on Joseph Carnegie, a 79-year-old Korean War vet with severe brain damage.





According to an investigation by the VA’s inspector general — the agency’s internal watchdog — Carnegie’s nearly 400-day stay in the hospital was marked by tension. His family repeatedly accused the staff of poor care, and staff members increasingly suspected his relatives were sabotaging his care to set them up.

VA supervisors began discussing whether to hide a camera in the room — a question that eventually was elevated all the way to the executive level. According to meeting notes uncovered by the inspector general, there was disagreement among the hospital’s leaders, until Fogarty herself authorized it.

Carnegie’s relatives thought the new smoke detector in his room looked a little odd, and a maintenance man confirmed there was a camera in it. That set off a public controversy first reported by the Tampa Bay Times that drew the attention of then-U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson, who requested the inspector general’s investigation.

The inspector general determined that the use of a hidden camera outside of a formal law enforcement investigation was very unusual at the VA, but in this case it was done out of legitimate concerns for patient safety.

“VA’s inspector general thoroughly reviewed this nearly seven-year-old matter, determining that ‘the patient received extensive, even exhaustive, high-quality care at (the Tampa VA Medical Center) … the patient’s family was aware of the (camera) when it was activated and began to record video images,’ and that use of the camera was ‘reasonable,’” Stewart, the Kansas City VA spokesman, said.

The Tampa Bay Times, however, found that in the aftermath of the camera’s discovery, hospital staff working under Fogarty untruthfully said that the camera was never intended to be hidden (internal memos showed it was), it was not recording (the investigation turned up 43 days worth of video) and that the family knew about the camera and signed a release authorizing it (it hadn’t).

In an editorial, the newspaper said Fogarty was responsible for “the hospital’s culture of defiance and non-responsiveness to public concerns.”

When Fogarty was tapped to temporarily take over the VA’s troubled Southwest region in 2014 amid a crisis over falsified patient wait times, Carnegie’s daughter told The Arizona Republic she was “disgusted.”

“To send the VA queen of cover-ups to Phoenix — it’s just a spit in our face,” said Natalie Carnegie, who could not be reached for comment for this story.

Budget balancing

In the radio interview, Fogarty said she had no regrets about the hidden camera because “the decision was made for the safety of that patient.” But she also said that if faced with a similar situation she would use an overt camera, not a hidden one.

In 2015 Fogarty took the job as director of the Kansas City VA Medical Center, which she described as a homecoming and a chance to serve at a smaller, less hectic hospital. Her salary — about $190,000 a year — is roughly the same as what she was making in Tampa Bay.

The following year USA Today included her in a list of VA administrators “transferred to new jobs despite concerns about the care provided to veterans at the facilities they were previously managing.”

The news organization cited Tampa Bay Times reporting that showed Fogarty “cut veterans’ access to outside care to help overcome a multimillion-dollar deficit as director of the Tampa, Fla., VA, in 2011 and repeatedly denied publicly that she was doing it.”

Stewart said USA Today’s story was “flat-out false and repeating it to your readers would be irresponsible.”

“When Director Fogarty became director of the Tampa VA Medical Center in 2011, she inherited a nearly $48 million budget deficit,” Stewart said. “She balanced the budget by using commonsense management principles such as not filling unneeded positions and eliminating unnecessary overtime and travel. Under Fogarty’s leadership, the facility expanded its services to Veterans, and the blueprint she developed for managing the resources remains in place at the VAMC today.”

That’s not what she told the Arizona Republic.

“In her interview last week, Fogarty said she balanced the Tampa VA budget in three years by reducing the time veterans spent in non-VA hospitals,” the newspaper wrote in an article published Nov. 27, 2014.

At least one VA spokeswoman who worked under Fogarty at the Tampa VA denied in 2011 that there even was a deficit — a claim the St. Petersburg Times wrote was “contradicted by the facility’s own budget records.”

The Farhners’ lawsuit is still in its early stages. Their Kansas City attorney, James LaSalle, said the VA had not released any information to the family in response to an administrative complaint they had to file before they could sue.

The agency also has not provided information about what happened between Farhner and police to former U.S. Sen. Claire McCaskill and current U.S. Sen. Roy Blunt, who both requested it.

LaSalle said the VA could be forced to hand over the investigative documents revealed by The Star’s records request during the suit’s discovery phase, but he had no timeline for when that might happen.

“I know that once it moves to litigation,” LaSalle said, “that stuff is evidence at this point.”"
USDA reports large U.S. soybean sale to China ahead of Trump-Xi meeting,https://www.reuters.com,"['Karl Plume', 'Min Read']",06-28-2019,2019,6,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-china-soybeans/usda-reports-large-us-soybean-sale-to-china-ahead-of-trump-xi-meeting-idUSKCN1TT2ET,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) on Friday reported a large soybean sale to China, an apparent goodwill gesture a day before the first meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping in seven months.

The trade war has curbed exports of U.S. crops to China and looms over the Group of 20 (G20) summit in Japan. Expectations have dimmed that the world’s two biggest economies can ease tensions when Trump and Xi meet in Osaka on Saturday.

The USDA said Chinese importers bought 544,000 tonnes of U.S. soybeans for shipment in the 2018/19 marketing year which expires Aug. 31. It was the largest U.S. soybean sale to China since late March, USDA data showed.

The USDA said in a statement the sale was new and not a change of destination of a previously announced sale.

The deal surprised some traders as soybean export premiums for late-summer shipments were unchanged this week, showing little evidence that a large purchase was occurring, and because recent large purchases have come only after talks between the two countries.

A sharp drop in China’s hog herd, which consumes most of the soybeans processed by the world’s largest pork market, due to a deadly hog disease called African swine fever has also reduced demand for the oilseed.

“To me it looks like a good faith purchase, which we’ve seen before, although in the past they came after the two presidents shook hands. Today it’s coming before they do so it may be trying to influence talks,” said Arlan Suderman, chief commodities economist for INTL FCStone.

“All this comes against a backdrop of China having ample supplies of soybeans and talk of them delaying shipment of July beans into August because of the big supplies,” he said.

Beijing had agreed to buy nearly 14 million tonnes from American farmers over December to March during a temporary truce in the trade spat.

More than 8 million tonnes of those have already been shipped to China, but about 6 million tonnes, including Friday’s sale, still need to be delivered.

Trump said on Friday he hopes for productive talks but made no promises about a reprieve from escalating tariffs that have cast a shadow on global growth.

U.S. soybean exports to China have plunged by more than 80 percent since Beijing slapped steep tariffs on shipments last July. China, the world’s top soybean importer, is on pace for its smallest U.S. soybean imports in 11 years as importers there have increased purchases from South America, mainly from top exporter Brazil."

New leaders installed at top immigration agencies amid questions over DHS secretary’s future,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Brooke Singman', 'Brooke Singman Is A Politics Reporter For Fox News. Follow Her On Twitter At']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/new-leaders-installed-at-top-immigration-agencies-amid-questions-over-dhs-secretarys-future,"The Trump administration named new leaders Thursday to top immigration agencies amid a deepening crisis at the border -- and swirling speculation over the future of the Homeland Security secretary who oversees it all after he was accused of leaking a highly sensitive operation.

Homeland Security Acting Secretary Kevin McAleenan on Thursday announced that Mark Morgan, who was serving as the acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, would be shifted over to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to replace former Commissioner John Sanders, who abruptly resigned from his post this week. ICE Deputy Director Matthew Albence was tapped to replace Morgan at that agency.

But bigger questions now surround McAleenan himself.

Two senior administration officials told Fox News that high-level discussions were underway with top administration and White House officials regarding McAleenan’s future in light of the accusations against him -- which the secretary strongly denies. The officials said there is uncertainty as to how much longer the secretary could remain in his post.

A White House official declined to comment on these claims when asked by Fox News.

DHS BOSS MCALEENAN ACCUSED OF OPPOSING, LEAKING PLANNED ICE RAIDS

McAleenan had come under fire after officials and other sources publicly, and privately, accused him of leaking details of planned ICE deportation raids. The report in question, which was published by Washington Post immigration reporter Nick Miroff, said the raids would take place before dawn in major cities.

A source familiar with the matter told Fox News that McAleenan traveled on a government plane to the border with Miroff less than 24 hours before the story was published. The source also said that when the raids were in a planning phase, McAleenan was opposed and even ordered Morgan to call off the operation -- though Trump told him to proceed. The president, though, put the operation on hold after the leak amid talks with Congress.

One senior administration official told Fox News on Thursday that after the alleged leak, ""He’s lost the confidence and trust of both the workforce and his superiors, with no viable path to proceed with any confidence and credibility.""

The official lamented the state of morale at the department, saying: “DHS has devolved into chaos and employee morale is abysmal.”

Another senior administration official also told Fox News Thursday that McAleenan has “completely lost his credibility leading the Department.”

“I can’t imagine the White House has an interest in keeping him in place much longer when they know he opposes most of their immigration policies,” the official said.

McAleenan, though, has adamantly denied the leak claims. In an interview with Brian Kilmeade on Fox News Radio, he said: ""Categorically, I did not and would not leak details of a law enforcement operation.""

Meanwhile, one of the officials told Fox News that McAleenan spent several days in Guatemala this week for multilateral meetings with Central American allies, while other top administration officials negotiated on Capitol Hill for additional funding for the agencies as part of a major piece of legislation -- which has not yet cleared Congress.

The official told Fox News that “support for a spending package vital to the department coalesced, was debated, and voted on in his absence.” That official also said that McAleenan has been “cut out of the process.”

Another administration official noted that McAleenan was slated to host a press conference on Thursday afternoon on the supplemental spending bill. “It’s interesting that he is standing alone. This is him trying to save his job, and taking a victory lap on the supplemental bill when he has been absent for the last few days.”

The event, though, was later canceled."

Jacky Rosen is blocking two of President Donald Trump's Department of Homeland Security nominees, citing ""inhumane and substandard"" conditions for children at the department's facilities, according to her office.

Rosen said she will delay the nominations of Chad F. Wolf for DHS under secretary for strategy, policy, and plans and Troy D. Edgar for chief financial officer. Earlier this month, the two appeared before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.

The future of their nominations now remain on hold, ""until the inhumane and substandard conditions for children at DHS processing and detention facilities improve significantly,"" Rosen said in a statement.

""I will maintain these holds until a nongovernmental third party certifies that DHS has complied. I will use all tools available to hold this Administration accountable for their treatment of vulnerable children and families,"" she added.

The move is yet another setback for the Trump administration which has been occupying several roles in DHS with acting heads, particularly in leadership.

Asbestos can cause a number of lung diseases, including cancer. File Photo by John Angelillo/UPI | License Photo

July 1 (UPI) -- A group of 10 states and Washington, D.C., sued the Environmental Protection Agency on Monday seeking increased regulation of cancer-causing asbestos.

The Democratic attorneys general said the EPA ignored their previous petition to create a new rule collecting data on the importation and use of the toxic substance. Such reporting is necessary, they say, to provide the EPA with the information it needs to regulate asbestos under the Toxic Substances Control Act.

""It is widely acknowledged that asbestos is one of the most harmful and toxic chemicals known to mankind,"" California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said in a statement. ""While it's troubling that we must once again take the EPA to court to force the agency to do its job, we won't pull any punches. There's too much at stake to let the EPA ignore the danger that deadly asbestos poses to our communities, including to workers and children.""

In April, the EPA issued a new rule it said would allow the agency to ban or restrict the use of certain asbestos products. Critics questioned why the agency didn't outright ban the substance.

Monday's lawsuit said the EPA's denial of the states' petition for further rulemaking in April was ""arbitrary and capricious.""

Joining California in the lawsuit were Connecticut, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, Oregon, Washington and the District of Columbia.

Asbestos is a naturally occurring fibrous material that has historically been used in a number of manufacturing processes, including the creation of insulation, fireproofing materials, automotive brakes, cement and other textile products. The substance can break down into microscopic pieces that can float into the air and be breathed in by humans, causing life-threatening diseases like asbestosis, lung cancer and mesothelioma."
The FTC’s Qualcomm Case Reveals Concerning Divide with DOJ on Patent Hold-Up,https://www.ipwatchdog.com,['The Author'],06-28-2019,2019,6,https://www.ipwatchdog.com/2019/06/28/ftcs-qualcomm-case-reveals-concerning-divide-doj-patent-hold/id=110764/,"“For over a decade, the FTC and DOJ had worked both in parallel and together to address the potential competitive harms posed by patent hold-up. The recent divergence between the DOJ and FTC on this issue is a troubling development that creates uncertainty.”

On May 2, the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) took the unusual step of submitting a Statement of Interest in the Federal Trade Commission’s (FTC’s) case against Qualcomm to take a position contrary to the FTC. The DOJ argued that “[b]ecause an overly broad remedy could result in reduced innovation, with the potential to harm American consumers, this Court should hold a hearing and order additional briefing to determine a proper remedy that protects competition while working minimal harm to public and private interests.” In response, the FTC informed the court that it “did not participate in or request” the DOJ’s filing, that it “disagree[d] with a number of contentions” made by the DOJ, and that the DOJ “misconstrues applicable law and the record.” In the end, the court agreed with the FTC and issued injunctive relief against Qualcomm without conducting the further remedy proceedings the DOJ advocated.

Underscoring the Divide

The public feuding between the two federal antitrust enforcement agencies about how to resolve a case litigated by one them was a remarkable spectacle. It also brought into focus a broader divide between the FTC and DOJ on the role of antitrust law in addressing patents that are essential to industry standards (SEPs) and subject to commitments to license on fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory (FRAND) terms.

Since being confirmed as Assistant Attorney General for the Antitrust Division in September 2017, Makan Delrahim has shifted the DOJ’s longstanding focus on the risks of patent hold-up—where SEP owners take advantage of large investments by companies to develop products using a standard to extract unreasonable, non-FRAND licensing terms—to address what he views as the greater risk of patent hold-out—which he defines as potential licensees colluding on issues such as licensing terms for SEPs. In a March 16, 2018 speech, Delrahim said that “hold-up is fundamentally not an antitrust problem, and therefore antitrust law should not be used as a tool to police FRAND commitments that patent-holders make to standard setting organizations” and offered his view that “implementer hold-out poses a more serious threat to innovation than innovator hold-up.”

Joseph Simons, the FTC Chairman, addressed this divide in a September 25, 2018 speech. While he noted that “[c]onsistency across the two federal enforcement agencies is . . . beneficial,” he observed that treatment of SEPs may be an area for “some potential inconsistency” between the agencies. He elaborated that “we agree with the Division that hold-out in the standard-setting process can raise serious concerns under antitrust law when such hold-out is the result of collusion among potential adopters/licensees. But we also believe that hold-up raises potential antitrust issues, as well.” Simons committed that the FTC “will continue our economically grounded and fact-based enforcement of the antitrust laws in this area.” Consistent with that approach, the FTC contended in a December 2018 filing in the Qualcomm case that “Qualcomm’s refusal to make SEP licenses available to competitors in breach of its voluntary commitments to standard-setting organizations is anticompetitive conduct.”

Although the DOJ submission in the Qualcomm case did not take a position on the merits, it appears to have been motivated by, and is consistent with, Delrahim’s efforts to downplay the potential for harm from patent hold-up. (Delrahim, who lobbied for Qualcomm, is reportedly recused from matters involving Qualcomm and did not sign the DOJ’s Qualcomm filing.) The DOJ filing highlighted the divergence between the DOJ and FTC on this important issue. It was not always so. For over a decade, the FTC and DOJ had worked both in parallel and together to address the potential competitive harms posed by patent hold-up. The recent divergence between the DOJ and FTC on this issue is a troubling development that creates uncertainty regarding what had been a consensus area of concern for the agencies.

The Roles of the DOJ and FTC

Before turning to how the DOJ and FTC have previously addressed patent hold-up, it is worth briefly examining the dual roles of the DOJ and FTC in enforcing the antitrust laws.

Among other statutes, the DOJ Antitrust Division is charged with criminal and civil enforcement under the Sherman Act and civil enforcement under the Clayton Act. The DOJ also provides guidance on the application of antitrust laws, including by issuing business review letters advising on how it may respond to particular proposed joint ventures or other business conduct.

The FTC was created with the passage of the FTC Act, which directs the agency to prevent “unfair methods of competition in or affecting commerce and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce.” 15 U.S.C. § 45(a)(2). As interpreted by the FTC, Section 5 of the FTC Act “encompasses not only those acts and practices that violate the Sherman or Clayton Act but also those that contravene the spirit of the antitrust laws and those that, if allowed to mature or complete, could violate the Sherman or Clayton Act.” Unlike the DOJ, the FTC does not conduct criminal enforcement.

The jurisdictions and roles of the FTC and DOJ thus overlap, including in merger reviews, investigations of anticompetitive conduct, and offering guidance on the antitrust laws. The agencies employ a “clearance” process to ensure that they do not undertake duplicative investigations that would, among other problems, subject targets to competing demands from the agencies and potentially lead to conflicting outcomes.

When it comes to the intersection of antitrust and intellectual property, both agencies have oversight responsibilities and they have collaborated to issue guidance on their shared approach to enforcement. For example, in 1995, the agencies jointly issued Antitrust Guidelines for the Licensing of Intellectual Property setting forth their policy on antitrust treatment of licensing intellectual property.

The DOJ and FTC Have Traditionally Agreed on the Dangers of Patent Hold-Up

Over the course of more than a decade—across both the Republican Bush Administration and the Democratic Obama Administration—the DOJ and FTC both consistently recognized that SEPs present a danger of hold-up, and that this was a proper subject for antitrust agency enforcement.

As early as 2006, the DOJ warned of the dangers of patent hold-up in a business review letter to a standard-setting organization (SSO): “Once a particular technology is chosen and the standard is developed . . . it can be extremely expensive or even impossible to substitute one technology for another. . . . Thus, those seeking to implement a given standard may be willing to license a patented technology included in the standard on more onerous terms than they would have been prior to the standard’s adoption in order to avoid the expense and delay of developing a new standard around a different technology.”

In 2007, the DOJ and FTC partnered to issue a report called Antitrust Enforcement and Intellectual Property Rights: Promoting Innovation and Competition. The agencies described the “potential for ‘hold up’ by the owner of patented technology after its technology has been chosen by the SSO as a standard and others have incurred sunk costs which effectively increase the relative cost of switching to an alternative standard.” The agencies warned that this “power to extract higher royalties or other licensing terms” could harm consumers “if those higher royalties were passed on in the form of higher prices.”

In 2013, the DOJ partnered with the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office on a Policy Statement on Remedies for Standards-Essential Patents Subject to Voluntary F/RAND Commitments. The Policy warned of the risk that SEPs could be used “to pressure an implementer of a standard to accept more onerous licensing terms than the patent holder would be entitled to receive consistent with the F/RAND commitment.” A DOJ official explained that the Statement “was informed by over a decade of thinking by the [DOJ Antitrust Division], the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), and the PTO about standards-setting activities and the IP policies of standard-setting organizations (SSOs).” (Delrahim announced in December 2018 that the DOJ was withdrawing its assent to the Statement.)

Beyond issuing guidance, the DOJ also accounted for patent hold-up in enforcement. In 2012, when the DOJ closed its investigation of Google’s acquisition of Motorola Mobility Holdings and a consortium’s acquisition of Nortel Networks’ SEPs, it explained that it had “focused on whether the acquiring firms would have the incentive and ability to exploit ambiguities in the SSOs’ F/RAND licensing commitments to hold up rivals, thus preventing or inhibiting innovation and competition,” including by “seeking to prevent or exclude products from practicing those SEPs from the market altogether.”

For its part, the FTC has challenged hold-up through seven enforcement actions over two decades. Those include a 2005 consent order with Union Oil Company of California (Unocal) after the FTC accused it of monopolizing a market for low-emission gasoline by misrepresenting in state regulatory standard-setting proceedings that an approach to reducing emissions was in the public domain when Unocal was actively pursuing patents on the technology that would later allow it to charge hold-up royalties to its competitors.

A Cause for Concern

The DOJ’s turn away from its long-held position on the risks of patent hold-up is a cause for serious concern.

First, it is bad policy. In explaining the DOJ’s about-face, Delrahim has referred to a “so-called ‘hold-up’ problem in the context of SSOs” and contended that concerns with hold-up “rely on models devoid of economic or empirical evidence that hold-up is a real phenomenon.” But the DOJ’s prior recognition of the risks of patent hold-up was well supported.

U.S. courts have long recognized that SEPs pose a hold-up threat. In 2007, for example, the Third Circuit observed that “[t]o guard against anticompetitive patent hold-up, most [standards development organizations] require firms supplying essential technologies for inclusion in a prospective standard to commit to licensing their technologies on FRAND terms.” Broadcom Corp. v. Qualcomm Inc., 501 F.3d 297, 313 (3d Cir. 2007). More recently, the Ninth Circuit explained that “[t]he development of standards . . . creates an opportunity for companies to engage in anti-competitive behavior” and that “[u]sing that standard-development leverage, the SEP holders are in a position to demand more for a license than the patented technology, had it not been adopted by the SSO, would be worth.” Microsoft Corp. v. Motorola, Inc., 795 F.3d 1024, 1031 (9th Cir. 2015); see also, e.g., Ericsson, Inc. v. D-Link Sys., Inc., 773 F.3d 1201, 1209 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (“SEPs pose two potential problems that could inhibit widespread adoption of the standard: patent hold-up and royalty stacking”).

As to the economics of patent hold-up, the DOJ observed in a 2015 business review letter that the “economic bargaining model underlying claims of hold-up has been studied extensively and applied to the standard-setting context,” citing scholarship dating back decades. That conclusion echoed the views of the DOJ and FTC in their 2007 report that patent hold-up is simply a “variant of the classic ‘hold-up problem’.” The DOJ also noted in its 2015 letter that “litigated cases demonstrate the potential for hold up when owners of RAND-encumbered standards-essential patents make royalty demands significantly above the adjudicated RAND rate” and provided examples where licensors’ demands were on the order of about 170 to 230 times what courts determined were RAND rates.

Recognition of the dangers of hold-up is thus well supported as a matter of law and economics. To be sure, if competitors collude in an SSO to fix the terms on which they will license technology, antitrust enforcement would be appropriate. But simply because one can envision the possibility of an alternative form of anticompetitive conduct relating to standard setting does not mean that the DOJ should simply ignore the well-documented existence of another form of harm.

Second, the DOJ’s abrupt shift away from over a decade of guidance on hold-up creates uncertainty for the many industries that rely on standards. While the shift in policy has been cast as being motivated by a concern for fostering innovation, it threatens to have the opposite effect. Companies planning investments in standardized products now face greater uncertainty about whether they can count on established rules, particularly as articulated in the DOJ’s business review letters, to safeguard their ability to license SEPs on FRAND terms.

Third, that a change in administration has led the DOJ to turn away from a long-held, bipartisan approach plays into the perception that antitrust enforcement is increasingly a political tool. While there may be higher profile examples of the politicization of antitrust enforcement, any step that suggests that a change in administration, not law and economics, will lead to wholesale departure from existing antitrust policy is troubling."
The Census Case Shows Why We Need a Defender General,https://slate.com,['Matthew R.

Mark Wilson/Getty Images

It’s been a rough couple of weeks for Department of Justice lawyers representing the Trump administration. Last week, career DOJ attorney Sarah Fabian came under intense criticism for an argument in which she equivocated when federal appellate judges asked her whether it would be “safe and sanitary” for the government to deny detained migrant children access to toothbrushes, soap, and blankets. And on Thursday, citing evidence that the Trump administration “contrived” its explanations to courts, the Supreme Court largely upheld a district court’s decision to block a citizenship question on the 2020 census. This opinion is a powerful, though tacit, rebuke of the DOJ attorneys who failed to acknowledge that their clients’ proffered rationale for adding the citizenship question—enforcing the Voting Rights Act—was pretextual. Essentially, the government lied about why it was taking a certain action in the census case, and the government’s attorneys failed to acknowledge those lies to the Supreme Court. This is not what our country’s top government lawyers should be doing.

I’ve litigated against Fabian and respect her public service, so I share the dismay that so many have expressed about her “safe and sanitary” argument. But the crucial lesson of the DOJ’s recent actions isn’t that we should be disappointed in a particular DOJ lawyer, or even Solicitor General Noel Francisco, who argued the government’s position in the census case. It’s that DOJ lawyers aren’t going to save us. As the census case shows, there are serious and ongoing institutional problems with the DOJ’s defense of Trump administration policies. These problems demand an institutional solution—one that will empower government lawyers to stand up for what’s right.

Part of the solution should be to create a new legal office—a defender general—to represent the interests of people subjected to government incarceration and detention, and to push back against faulty legal arguments by government attorneys that advance the president’s political interests.

It’s the end of responsible government as we know it, and the DOJ feels fine.

Let’s start with the DOJ. It has spent two-plus years utterly failing to serve as a bulwark against the Trump administration’s wanton cruelty. Sadly, we now know that, no matter what cruel policies Trump undertakes, skilled lawyers will not only take prestigious political jobs like solicitor general and attorney general, but use those jobs to paper over the Trump administration’s discriminatory intent.

For example, although in theory the solicitor general’s office has a practice of “confessing error” when it believes the government should lose a case, Francisco has not seen fit to concede the illegality of any Trump administration policy. Not the Muslim ban. Not the ban on transgender service personnel. Not family separation (where an appeal has been held in abeyance following a district court ruling against the practice). And not the citizenship question, even when confronted with what the Supreme Court just called “an explanation for agency action that is incongruent with what the record reveals about the agency’s priorities and decisionmaking process.”

It’s the end of responsible government as we know it, and the DOJ feels fine.

Career DOJ lawyers like Fabian can’t be expected to fix what those in leadership are breaking. These lawyers are in a difficult situation because their political clients and bosses often direct the positions they take in court. If they stay in their jobs, their legal skills might be exploited to defend a cruel practice or launder Trump’s discriminatory intent. If they quit in protest, they will inevitably be replaced by lawyers who are less troubled by Trump’s actions.

Indeed, as a civil rights lawyer representing immigrants against the Trump administration, I’ve been frustrated by the tactics and arguments that some career DOJ lawyers have deployed to keep my clients from the justice they deserve. But I don’t think the career DOJ lawyers are calling the shots.

To protect the rule of law, and to save the legal profession from being debased by the next Trump, we need to look beyond individual attorneys and toward the health of our institutions.

Here’s where the Office of the Defender General would come in. The concept of a defender general has been floated in legal circles as a means of improving representation for indigent criminal defendants. Consistent with these aims, Valparaiso University Law School professor Andrea Lyon has proposed that a defender general could serve as a “voice at the policy table for the accused, incarcerated and paroled.” And Sen. Cory Booker has introduced legislation that would create a “Defender Office for Supreme Court Advocacy” to help criminal defendants in the U.S. Supreme Court and state courts of last resort.

The events of the Trump era point to another reason to create a defender general’s office: the need to counteract the DOJ during times of moral rot.

A defender general’s office could serve precisely this function if it were afforded some independence—Booker’s bill would make it a nonprofit corporation—and if its mission were understood to go beyond criminal defense. We need a government-sponsored institution whose lawyers will stand up in court, and stand athwart DOJ lawyers, to articulate our country’s interests in the liberty of people subjected to government incarceration and detention, from prisons and jails to immigration detention.

Properly empowered, a defender general could pressure the DOJ to make more responsible legal arguments, and then publicly and loudly call out the DOJ—within government and in court—when it falls short. Would DOJ leaders have sent a career lawyer to quibble with federal judges about soap and blankets for detained kids if they had understood that a prestigious government-funded law office was prepared to tell the court that the DOJ’s position was meritless?

Another virtue of creating a defender general office is that it would generate alumni who could speak out in public when the government oversteps. A weird feature of the Trump era has been that so many “resistance” heroes are former prosecutors. This is partly because media outlets favor people who have been powerful lawyers, and there are almost no powerful government law jobs devoted to criminal defense or civil rights. As a result, the voices of lawyers who have devoted their careers to freeing people, instead of advancing reasons to keep them locked up, tend to be disproportionately drowned out, not only in government but in the public square.

None of this means that a quasi-governmental defender general could easily halt the Department of Justice’s dismaying slide toward defending the indefensible. But it’s clear that the remedy for what ails the DOJ must include institutional reform of some kind.

Hard-liners inside and outside the Trump administration are pressing for the removal of President Donald Trump’s acting Homeland Security secretary amid a rolling leadership purge that began in April and shows no signs of ending, according to five people in the Trump administration and four former Department of Homeland Security officials.

Kevin McAleenan, who took over the post less than three months ago, is under heavy criticism from prominent Trump allies, including former Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Thomas Homan, who might become the administration’s immigration czar.

Following the purge of three other immigration officials since the April resignation of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, McAleenan stands accused of disloyalty to the Trump White House’s hard line on immigration because of a perception that he didn’t support ICE raids targeting migrant families scheduled to begin last weekend.

Acting Customs and Border Protection Commissioner John Sanders, a McAleenan ally, said Monday that he’ll resign effective July 5. Sanders did not offer a public explanation for his resignation.

Several critics of the administration, including former DHS officials, have characterized the latest shakeup as another instance of White House senior adviser Stephen Miller seizing an opportunity to fill key immigration posts with allies. But one senior administration official said the president also agrees with these stances.

“The two issues the president is driving the train on at all times are trade and immigration,” the official said. “There is disbelief inside the administration that we can’t enforce the law and people are trying to find the right personnel who will do it and not look for ways out of it.”

Miller and DHS did not respond to requests for comment. The White House press office also did not immediately respond to a request for comment on McAleenan.

The turmoil mirrors a chaotic situation along the southern border, where thousands of migrants are arriving each day and detained children are being denied basic necessities like toothbrushes and soap. Current and former DHS employees complain that the leadership turnover and attendant jostling for power have slowed the government’s ability to respond to what is now widely recognized to be a crisis.

“It’s awful for morale,” said one current CBP official. “Whoever’s going to be confirmed to acting [commissioner] next, we’re back to square one, getting a new person briefed. … It’s like starting all over in a transition.”

Homan suggested on “Fox & Friends” that this week’s planned ICE raids were delayed because McAleenan leaked information about them.

“You’ve got the acting secretary of Homeland Security resisting what ICE is trying to do,” Homan said. “In The Washington Post or in numerous media outlets, he does not support this operation, and I tell you what, if that’s his position, then he’s on the wrong side of this issue. You don’t tell the men and women of ICE, a day before they go out there and do this operation — ‘Look, this story was leaked.’ They gave the locations of the cities, the day it was supposed to start, how many targets.”

Homan spoke while sitting in front of a DHS seal, looking like a government official — something he has not been since June 2018. The seal was in a room set up in the basement of his Virginia home, according to two former DHS officials. Trump told Fox News on June 14 that Homan would be his new “border czar,” but Homan said a day later that the announcement was “kind of premature” and indicated that he hadn’t yet decided whether to take the job. An administration official said Wednesday that Homan has not yet been given a clear description of what the job would entail.

“Homan’s getting paid a lot better as border czar of Fox News than border czar of the White House,” said Ali Noorani, executive director of the pro-migrant National Immigration Forum. “And he kind of has the same job, to go on Fox News and carry the administration’s message.”

Several administration officials and hard-line immigration advocates have targeted McAleenan in recent days, arguing behind the scenes that he’s too liberal to run DHS because he served under President Barack Obama and has donated money in the past to Democratic candidates and organizations. Conservative media outlets, including the Washington Examiner, have run critical stories to amplify that narrative.

Brandon Judd, president of a union that represents Border Patrol agents and a Trump ally, also torched McAleenan in a Fox News op-ed over the weekend.

Judd — who has attacked McAleenan in the past for being insufficiently committed to Trump — said that if McAleenan did leak information about the raids, then he “was inexcusably willing to put the public at risk and law enforcement officers in harm’s way in order to further his own agenda.”

“There is no question that the president is sensitive to the lack of progress in resolving this crisis at the border and frustrated with the pace of changes, and it has become increasingly evident that one of the main reasons for the lack of progress is because Kevin McAleenan has been reluctant to take action that would more effective,” said Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the restrictionist Center for Immigration Studies. “A lot of ideas proposed have been bottled up by him and his front office.”

The Trump White House assumed McAleenan could work with Democrats on Capitol Hill to secure more funding and policy changes, since he’s worked under both Republican and Democratic administrations, Vaughan said. But “he has not been able to deliver on those things.”

Within the past month Trump installed a pair of vocal immigration hard-liners in key immigration positions, naming Mark Morgan acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Ken Cuccinelli acting director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Both had drawn the president’s attention by making provocative statements about immigration on Fox News; Morgan, for instance, said he could tell whether a migrant child would later join MS-13 merely by looking into that child’s eyes.

Morgan appears already on the move. POLITICO and other outlets reported Tuesday that he’s expected to be named the new acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, although the White House has not made an official announcement.

Cuccinelli, meanwhile, scored a coveted perk during his first month that his predecessor, Francis Cissna, never enjoyed. Trump designated him to be one of 10 officials to get a government-funded car to drive him from his Virginia home to USCIS headquarters.

A USCIS spokesperson confirmed that Cuccinelli had been granted the benefit, but said that he “is currently driving himself to the office.”

Both newly installed officials occupy new “principal deputy director” positions created at their respective agencies to allow them to serve in an acting capacity under the 1998 Federal Vacancies Reform Act — a bureaucratic sleight-of-hand that could circumvent the confirmation process.

Cuccinelli, a former Virginia attorney general and head of a conservative political action committee, would face a hard road to confirmation in the Senate because he backed challenges to mainstream Republicans in recent years, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Morgan would at the least face strong Democratic opposition.

“I think the White House is looking for a certain model,” said one current administration official. “Cuccinelli and Morgan have been on Fox every day. I don’t think you’ll ever see Sanders up there.”

The latest personnel shake-up happened just days after the administration caught flak for its treatment of roughly 300 migrant children at a Texas facility who were filthy, hungry, and largely unsupervised, according to lawyers who interviewed some of them.

Several conservative immigration advocates said the DHS shake-up was unrelated to the ensuing public outcry, and instead had been brewing for weeks. Moving Morgan to CBP sets the stage for the administration to now get rid of McAleenan, one advocate said.

“Things have not changed at DHS since Nielsen left,” said a top official at a restrictionist immigration organization. “I disagreed with them getting rid of Francis Cissna but right now, they are looking in the right place.”

But “having all of this churn and not having stable leadership makes it very difficult to address the problems,” said Leon Fresco, former deputy assistant attorney general for the Justice Department's Office of Immigration Litigation. “Whenever you change a leader, you automatically lose a month as the person gets acclimated.”
