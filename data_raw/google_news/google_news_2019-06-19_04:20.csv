"Trump launches re-election bid before jam-packed arena, vows to 'Keep America Great'",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'President Trump', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-launches-2020-re-election-campaign-orlando-arena,"President Trump formally launched his 2020 re-election campaign Tuesday night before a jam-packed crowd in Orlando's Amway Center arena, and quickly unloaded on the media organizations and government actors he said tried their hardest with ""everything they had"" to bring down both his candidacy and presidency.

To chants of ""USA,"" Trump took the stage after brief remarks by Vice President Mike Pence and first lady Melania Trump, and recalled his unlikely rise to power.

""We stared down the unholy alliance of lobbyists and donors and special interests who made a living bleeding our country dry,"" Trump said. ""The swamp is fighting back so viciously and violently. For the last two and a half years, we have been under siege.”

And after polling the boisterous crowd, Trump appeared to settle on a new campaign slogan: ""Keep America Great.""

He went on to tout the economy and the planned Space Force, celebrate the ""obliteration"" of ISIS, and declare that ""Republicans believe that every life is a sacred gift from God"" amid a newly energized national pro-life movement.

Just over four years ago, Trump descended through the pink marble and brass atrium of Trump Tower to announce his candidacy for president, the first step on a journey few analysts believed would take him all the way to the White House.

This time, thousands of Trump supporters arrived more than 40 hours in advance to secure a spot in the Amway Center, despite sweltering heat. Some had been camped in chairs for several nights.

Trump told attendees he had begun not only a ""great political campaign but a great movement"" committed to the idea that a government must ""care for its own citizens first.""

He called his election that year as a ""defining moment in American history"" -- and then directed the crowd to ""ask them, right there,"" referring to the media assembled in the back, which many in the crowd jeered.

In one of the most dramatic moments of the rally, Trump charged that Democrats want a ""do-over"" of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report -- and then, his voice approaching a shout, Trump blasted Democrats' apparent lack of interest in misconduct within their party.

""Our patriotic movement has been under assault from the very first day,"" Trump said. He specifically called out the ""phony"" dossier used by the FBI to secure a secret surveillance warrant to surveil one of his former aides, Carter Page.

After Trump noted that the dossier was funded by the Hillary Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee (DNC), the crowd again broke into a chant, this time cheering, ""Lock her up.""

""If you want to know how the system is rigged, just look at how they came at us for three years with everything they had, versus the free pass they gave to Hillary and her aides after they set up an illegal server, destroyed evidence, deleted and acid-washed 33,000 emails, exposed classified information, and turned the State Department into a pay-for-play cash machine,"" Trump said, his voice rising with the crowd's.

""Lock her up,"" the crowd responded again.

DOJ REACHED DEAL WITH CLINTON LAWYERS TO KEEP CLINTON FOUNDATION EMAILS FROM FBI

""33,000 emails deleted, think of it!"" Trump said. ""You know, there was a lot of corruption on the other side. But, you know, they get a subpoena from the United States Congress, and they decide they're not gonna give it, so, Lindsey Graham, they delete and they acid wash -- which is very expensive, nobody does it -- those emails, never to be seen again!

""But we may find them again somewhere deep in the State Department,"" Trump mused. ""Can you imagine if I got a subpoena? Think of this -- if I deleted one email, like a love note to Melania, it's the electric chair for Trump.""

STATE DEPT INVESTIGATION FINDS 'MULTIPLE' SECURITY VIOLATIONS UNDER CLINTON LEADERSHIP, AS PROBE CONTINUES

For the most part, the rally focused on Trump's policy successes, on a range of matters including criminal justice reform and the economy.

""Our country is soaring to incredible new heights,"" Trump asserted, to loud applause. ""Our economy is the envy of the world, perhaps the greatest economy we've had in the history of our country, and as long as you keep this team in place -- we have a tremendous way to go -- our future has never, ever looked brighter or sharper.""

Trump continued: ""The fact is, the American Dream is back. It's bigger, and better, and stronger than ever before.""

The president emphasized his success in appointing federal judges, and lamented Democrats' treatment of now-Justice Brett Kavanuagh, telling the crowd, ""They didnt just try to win, they tried to destroy him with false and malicious accusations"" in the name of ""political dominance and control.""

Trump called Kavanaugh a ""great gentleman"" who is ""highly respected"" throughout the judiciary, and said Democrats also targeted his family. Kavanuagh, speaking to Fox News last year, said his wife had received numerous death threats.

""Just imagine what this angry left-wing mob would do if they were in charge of this country,"" Trump said.

""We just finished [confirming judge] number 107, already approved, sitting on the bench -- how about that?"" Trump then asked. ""By the time we're finished with the rest, we will have record percentages [of judges appointed] -- our percentage will be a record, except for one person. One person has a higher percentage ... George Washington.""

At one point, outgoing Press Secretary Sarah Sanders took the stage, bringing the crowd to its feet.

""We want people to come into our country based on merit,"" Trump said, after praising Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials as underappreciated heroes securing the border.

He went on to condemn ""crazy"" Bernie Sanders, and vowed again that America would ""never"" become a socialist country.

The festive and lively environment was evident both outside and inside the arena. Caps and shirts and mugs and ponchos were being hawked in corners far and wide in Orlando, with slogans ranging from ""God, Guns and Trump"" to ""Trump’s Deplorables"" to ""Working to Defeat Liberals since 1854.""

""Think of this -- if I deleted one email, like a love note to Melania, it's the electric chair for Trump."" — President Trump

""Bikers For Trump"" volunteer security members managed traffic in and out of the rally areas as jubilant Trump devotees partied to a band while in line, occasionally breaking into ""USA, USA"" chants.

Others wandered the blocks around the venue urging people to sign a petition to ""prevent voter fraud.""

""Only U.S. citizens should be able to vote,"" explained Donny, a Jacksonville native. ""That’s what we want in Florida.""

Joe Biden, the frontrunner among Democrats in both polling and fundraising, sought to blunt the momentum from the Tuesday launch shortly before Trump took the stage.

ON THE GROUND BEFORE TRUMP'S BIG RALLY, A CARNIVAL-LIKE ATMOSPHERE

""Donald Trump is launching his campaign for re-election tonight and the American people face a choice -- we can make Trump an aberration or let him fundamentally and forever alter the character of this nation,"" Biden Deputy Campaign Manager Kate Bedingfield said in a statement.

""Our country cannot afford four more years of Trump diminishing America's role on the world stage, cutting access to health care, ignoring the climate emergency that is an unprecedented threat to our national security, tearing children from their parents at the border, giving enormous new tax breaks to big corporations and the wealthy at the expense of working families, and dividing our country by embracing toxic bigotry and racism that's antithetical to who we are,"" Bedingfield added.

Sanders, meanwhile, hosted an ""Ask Me Anything"" open forum on Reddit on Tuesday. The self-described democratic socialist condemned what he called Trump's ""rejection of science,"" and lamented the ""incredible attacks against working families that have taken place under unfettered capitalism.""

Sanders, in a video response to Trump's address later in the day, issued a series of personal insults. He called Trump a ""racist"" and ""sexist,"" among other attacks.

""The working class of this country has been decimated for decades by a coordinated attack from corporate America,"" Sanders told one Reddit user. ""Bad trade deals have allowed corporations to ship millions of jobs abroad, companies have bitterly resisted unionization and the minimum wage has not been raised for almost 10 years.""

Not all of the participants in Sanders' Reddit event gave him a warm welcome, however, with some pointing out Sanders' recent, dramatic rise to wealth.

""People like you have destroyed the working class by taking more of their taxes to fund a corporate-run utopia that never can exist,"" one user replied. ""Wealth is decided by the rarity of your skill set, not how hard you work, Mr. 3 mansions and an Audi R8.""

Trump is ahead of his Democrat rivals in key battleground states and ""voters overall"" support re-electing him, a Republican National Committee (RNC) memo obtained by Fox News claimed. The memo came amid reports of the president struggling in polls putting him up against potential 2020 opponents, including Biden. A Fox News poll showed similar numbers.

But, according to the RNC, its own massive data operation told a different story. According to the committee's numbers, Trump has a higher approval than disapproval rating in the battleground states of Ohio and Pennsylvania while a majority of Florida voters (53 percent) supported re-electing him.

Trump has an unprecedented $40.8 million in cash-on-hand, as of the start of the second quarter of fundraising on April 1. While that would be a massive war chest on its own, the Trump campaign, the Republican National Committee and their joint fundraising committees had a combined $82 million cash-on-hand going into the second quarter.

"The Evangelical, the ‘Pool Boy,’ the Comedian and Michael Cohen",https://www.nytimes.com,"['Frances Robles', 'Jim Rutenberg']",06-18-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/18/us/trump-falwell-endorsement-michael-cohen.html,"That attempt, Mr. Cohen says on the recording, came months before he brought Mr. Falwell “to the table” for Mr. Trump. Until then, he adds, “none of the evangelicals wanted to support Trump.”

There is no evidence that Mr. Falwell’s endorsement was part of a quid pro quo arranged by Mr. Cohen. Indeed, the relationship, if any, between the endorsement and the photo episode remains unclear. But the new details — some of which have been reported by news outlets including BuzzFeed and Reuters over the last year — show how deeply Mr. Falwell was enmeshed in Mr. Cohen’s and Mr. Trump’s world.

And they add another layer to one of the enduring curiosities of the Trump era: the support the president has received from evangelical Christians, who have traditionally demanded that their political leaders exhibit “family values” and moral “character.” Mr. Falwell’s father forged those words into weapons against the Democrats after he co-founded the Moral Majority political movement, which propelled Ronald Reagan into the White House and made religious conservatives a vital constituency for any Republican who would be president.

By the time Republicans cast their first votes in 2016, Mr. Trump was starting to show surprising strength among some white evangelicals. But with Mr. Falwell serving as the torchbearer of his father’s legacy, his endorsement became a permission slip for deeply religious conservatives who were attracted by Mr. Trump’s promises to make America great again but wary of his well-known history of infidelity, his previous support of abortion rights and his admission that he had never asked for God’s forgiveness.

“For those of the more fundamentalist variant of evangelicalism, the Falwell family, and the Falwell endorsements, are an important factor,” said Jim Guth, a political-science professor at Furman University who has long studied evangelical politics. Mr. Cruz still managed to win in Iowa. But Mr. Trump soon won South Carolina with strong evangelical support, sending him on a solid path toward the nomination.

Three years later, Mr. Falwell remains an unwavering Trump supporter. Last month he went so far as to suggest that the president deserved an extended term as “reparations” for time lost to the Mueller investigation. In turn, he has had entree to the White House, providing input on education policies that stand to benefit Liberty."
Donald Trump Won’t Apologize To Central Park Five: “They’ve Admitted Their Guilt”,https://deadline.com,['Denise Petski'],06-18-2019,2019,6,https://deadline.com/2019/06/donald-trump-wont-apologize-central-park-five-when-they-see-us-1202634547/,"Don’t expect an apology from President Donald Trump to the so-called Central Park Five, the five men who are the subject of Ava DuVernay’s When They See Us Netflix miniseries, which has brought renewed attention to the case.

When asked today by White House correspondent April Ryan if he would apologize to the five men who were falsely accused of a brutal rape, but were later completely exonerated, Trump asked Ryan, “Why do you bring that question up now? It’s an interesting time to bring it up.”

Trump continued, “You have people on both sides of that. They admitted their guilt. If you look at Linda Fairstein, and you look at some of the prosecutors, they think that the city should never have settled that case. So we’ll leave it at that.”

Trump in 1989 bought full page ads in New York City newspapers calling for the reinstatement of the death penalty in New York following the arrest of the five then-teens ― four of whom were black and one Hispanic ― in connection with the rape of a white jogger in Central Park.

The five were completely exonerated when another suspect was identified through DNA evidence, and a court found that the confessions to which Trump referred were coerced.

Trump has said as recently as 2016 that the five men were guilty.



When They See Us, released May 31 on Netflix, begins in the spring of 1989 when the teenagers were first questioned about the incident, through their 2002 exoneration and 2014 settlement reached with the city of New York."
Juan Williams: Anti-Trump protesters targeting Lawrence Jones with racist abuse an example of 'intolerance coming from the left',https://www.foxnews.com,['Charles Creitz'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/juan-williams-lawrence-jones-left-intolerance,"Anti-Trump protestors who targeted Fox News contributor Lawrence Jones with racist remarks during an impeachment rally in Manhattan exposed a level of intolerance on the left, according to Juan Williams.

Williams tackled the topic on ""The Five,"" after protesters at the rally told Jones to ""go back to Kenya"" and to go back to Fox News ""where there's more cotton for you to pick,"" according to a Fox News producer who was at the scene.

""Lawrence has a legitimate right to speak his truth,"" Williams said Tuesday, before saying the incident is proof there is intolerance on both sides of the political aisle.

""Why don't you want to hear it? To me, that's intolerance coming from the left.""

Williams continued by describing the behavior as ""damning"" and questioning why people ""go to that extent"".

""That kind of attitude toward Lawrence is not acceptable,"" he said. ""To me, it is so damning that they feel the need to go to that extent.""

Williams' comments came after Jones described the incident on ""Hannity"" on Monday night.

""This is who they are, Sean,"" the Campus Reform editor-in-chief claimed. ""So often those of us on the right are painted as the racist people, the hateful people,"" he said.

House Republicans demand hearing after State Dept. cites 'multiple security incidents' under Clinton leadership,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-republicans-demand-hearing-after-state-dept-cites-multiple-security-incidents-under-clinton-leadership,"House Oversight Committee Republicans on Tuesday formally called for an immediate hearing on security breaches at the State Department during Hillary Clinton's leadership, after the department said Monday it had uncovered ""multiple security incidents"" involving more than a dozen employees.

In a letter to Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings, D-Md., ranking committee Republicans Jim Jordan, Mark Meadows and Jody Hice said State Department officials conducting the ongoing security review into the matter should testify.

""We request a hearing to examine widespread security protocol breaches at the State Department concerning former Secretary Hillary Clinton’s private email server,"" the Republicans wrote. ""The unorthodox and unsecure arrangement she maintained exposed classified, national security and diplomatic-sensitive information to a myriad of risks and related issues.

'OMG': TOP HILLARY AIDE STUNNED BY APPARENT EMAIL HACK ATTEMPT IN MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT, FBI DOCS SHOW

""The wide-ranging fallout from these mishandling instances should not be minimized and obscured,"" they added.

On Monday, the State Department disclosed that it had identified ""multiple security incidents"" involving current or former employees' handling of Clinton's emails, and that 23 ""violations"" and seven ""infractions"" have been issued as part of the department's ongoing investigation.

The information came in a letter to Iowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley, who is responsible for overseeing the security review.

""To this point, the department has assessed culpability to 15 individuals, some of whom were culpable in multiple security incidents,"" Mary Elizabeth Taylor, the State Department's assistant secretary in the Bureau of Legislative Affairs, wrote to Grassley. ""DS has issued 23 violations and seven infractions. ... This number will likely change as the review progresses.""

President Trump highlighted the finding in a tweet overnight, questioning whether Democrats would investigate and saying, ""This is really big.""

Former House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz, now a Fox News contributor, said Tuesday that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo should personally handle the probe into departmental misconduct.

""I love Mike Pompeo as the secretary of state,"" Chaffetz said. ""I have the greatest respect for him, he's got his very full plate, but he has to personally get involved with this. Some people should be fired, they should lose their security clearances and they should be in jail.""

The State Department, dubbing the matter ""serious,"" said it expected to conclude its investigation by Sept. 1. The department acknowledged that the probe was unusually time-consuming.

""Given the volume of emails provided to the department from former Secretary Clinton's private email server, the department's process has been necessarily more complicated and complex requiring a significant dedication of time and resources,"" Taylor wrote.

Taylor also noted that disciplinary consequences were pending, and that internal referrals have been made to State Department Human Resources and security officials, even where employees involved no longer work with the department.

Clinton's private email use has remained in the spotlight, as the DOJ looks into potential misconduct in the handling of federal authorities' surveillance and intelligence operations in 2016. Then-FBI Director James Comey said in 2016 that Clinton's handling of classified information was ""extremely careless"" -- but that ""no reasonable prosecutor"" would bring charges.

Last month, a trove of partially redacted FBI documents from the agency's investigation into whether Clinton mishandled classified information -- a probe known as the ""Midyear Exam"" -- revealed that top Clinton aides were shocked at apparent attempts to hack her private email servers.

The document release revealed numerous episodes in which the Clinton team either suspected it had been hacked or seemingly acknowledged that security measures had come up short.

""omg,"" top Clinton aide Huma Abedin wrote to Justin Cooper, the technology pro overseeing Clinton's private home-based email servers, when he told her shortly after midnight on Jan. 9, 2011, that ""someone was trying to hack us.""

And this past March, it was revealed that the Justice Department ""negotiated"" an agreement with Clinton's legal team that ensured the FBI did not have access to emails on her private servers relating to the Clinton Foundation. Former FBI Agent Peter Strzok testified about the arrangement during a closed-door appearance before the House Judiciary Committee last summer, according to a transcript released this year.

The agreement was reached, Strzok said, because ""according to the attorneys, we lacked probable cause to get a search warrant for those servers and projected that either it would take a very long time and/or it would be impossible to get to the point where we could obtain probable cause to get a warrant.""

The DOJ's goal, Chaffetz said at the time, was to ""make sure they hear no evil, see no evil -- they had no interest in pursuing the truth."""
William Barr’s Justice Department Is Now Openly Running Legal Interference for Paul Manafort,https://slate.com,['Mark Joseph Stern'],06-18-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/06/paul-manafort-william-barr-new-york-prison.html,"President Donald Trump listens to Attorney General William Barr during a ceremony in the East Room of the White House on May 22 in Washington, D.C. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images

Donald Trump’s Department of Justice has decided to run interference for Paul Manafort, protecting him from harsh imprisonment and even questioning the validity of charges brought against him by state prosecutors. This effort to aid the president’s loyal associate behind bars is a startling escalation of Attorney General William Barr’s campaign to help Trump and his confederates evade consequences for their misdeeds.

Manafort, Trump’s former campaign chairman, was convicted of fraud and tax evasion in 2018 then pleaded guilty to illegal foreign lobbying and witness tampering. He was first prosecuted by special counsel Robert Mueller, who secured a 7.5-year federal prison sentence earlier this year. Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance then brought 16 additional charges under New York law. Manafort is currently housed in Loretto, a federal prison in southwest Pennsylvania, and Vance’s office requested his transfer to a New York facility. (Typically, federal prisoners awaiting trial in New York state court are held in the notoriously brutal Rikers Island jail.)

In May, Manafort attorney Todd Blanche wrote a letter to Vicky Moser, Loretto’s warden, protesting this transfer. Blanche asked that Manafort be allowed to remain in Loretto to address his “health challenges” and preserve his “reasonable access to counsel.” And Blanche had another reason his client deserved special treatment: Manafort, Blanche alleged, “is being prosecuted in New York for exactly the same conduct for which he has already been tried and sentenced” in federal court. The New York prosecution thus “appears to be a blatant violation” of the state’s “long-standing and highly protective” double jeopardy laws. Condemning Vance’s actions as “politics at its worst,” Blanche declared that Vance is “attempting to add insult to injury” by placing his client on Rikers Island. In other words, Manafort should not be moved to New York because the New York charges against him are invalid.

By itself, this letter would be unremarkable, a plea from his top-shelf lawyer that Manafort be treated better than virtually every other inmate in the United States. What is remarkable—indeed, shocking—is that the deputy attorney general, the second-highest law enforcement official in the country, seemed to implicitly endorse Blanche’s complaints. On June 11, Jeffrey Rosen forwarded the letter to Vance’s office and asked for a “response” before federal officials made “a decision” about moving Manafort to New York. Rosen even gave Vance a deadline, asking him to respond within a week.

Rosen’s letter creates the impression that the Justice Department is working to undermine state charges against Manafort.

On June 14, Vance responded to Rosen granting Blanche’s request. He also forwarded Rosen a separate letter written by Assistant District Attorney Christopher Conroy to Loretto’s warden. Conroy described the proposed arrangement as “a departure from usual practice” and “inconsistent” with the Interstate Agreement on Detainers. But the district attorney would allow it anyway, almost certainly because Rosen threw the weight of the Department of Justice behind the effort to protect Manafort and attack state charges that Trump would not be able to pardon.

Conroy further noted that the district attorney’s office never actually tried to put Manafort at Rikers Island; it merely sought “temporary custody” in any nearby facility so Manafort could be “made available for arraignment and subsequent proceedings in a timely manner.” Regardless, the district attorney would let Manafort remain at Loretto so long as the feds promised to make him available in New York court “without interruption or delay.”

Vance himself responded to Blanche’s accusations that the New York charges are an illegal violation of double jeopardy. These “gratuitous” arguments, Vance wrote, “have no place in a routine procedural analysis” of inmate relocation. Conroy’s letter also pointed out that if Manafort “believes he has valid statutory double jeopardy” defenses, he “will have a full opportunity to pursue” them in New York court.

For the record, Blanche is probably right that some charges in the New York indictment should fall under the state’s unusually strict double jeopardy regime. But Vance brought other charges under state laws with elements and purposes distinct from their federal counterparts that could to fall outside of double jeopardy protections. For instance, New York laws criminalizing the falsification of business records differ substantially from the federal fraud charges for which Manafort was convicted. While Blanche can mount a plausible argument that the New York indictment runs afoul of state double jeopardy charges, it is certainly not so clear-cut that the state charges should be treated as entirely illegitimate.

I happen to think that no one should be housed in Rikers Island, a hotbed of human rights abuses that ought to be permanently shuttered. I also think states should be prohibited from prosecuting an individual for a crime already punished by the federal government. But I do not believe that the United States Department of Justice should intervene on behalf of the president’s associate to secure benefits for him that no other prisoner receives. It is, in fact, an appalling perversion of the agency’s putative integrity, particularly in light of persistent speculation that Trump may pardon Manafort.

If he does, the task will fall to states to hold Manafort accountable for his crimes, since the president cannot pardon state offenses. Rosen’s letter creates two inescapable impressions: First, that the Department of Justice—so recently responsible for putting Manafort behind bars—is now attempting to keep him as comfortable as possible until Trump issues his pardon; and second, that the DOJ is working to undermine the validity of state charges against Manafort so that he would not languish in state prison if he receives a presidential pardon.

None of this is surprising with Barr in control of the DOJ. A chronic liar and smear artist, Barr has swiftly sullied the agency, turning it into an especially powerful arm of Trump’s PR machine. He and his deputies have all but announced that they have Manafort’s back. Even as the DOJ slow-walks and obstructs the implementation of the First Step Act, keeping rehabilitated prisoners incarcerated for no reason, it helps protect Manafort from the cruelties of the criminal justice system. This is a level of corruption usually only seen in kleptocratic nations. Now it’s right out in the open in these United States."
"Trump Admin Hid Acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan’s Dark Past, Senators Say",https://www.thedailybeast.com,"['Erin-Banco Sam-Brodey Lachlan-Markay Noah-Shachtman', 'Erin Banco', 'Sam Brodey', 'Lachlan Markay', 'Noah Shachtman', 'National Security Reporter', 'Congressional Reporter']",06-18-2019,2019,6,https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-admin-hid-acting-secretary-of-defense-patrick-shanahans-dark-past-senators-say,"The senators tasked with vetting Acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan say they were unaware of the accusations of domestic violence in his family that led to his resignation Tuesday. The altercations never came up during Shanahan’s 2017 confirmation hearing for the position of Deputy Secretary of Defense, lawmakers told The Daily Beast, nor did it arise as he was preparing to assume the role of Pentagon chief permanently.

“We’ve been wondering why we have not gotten an FBI report. It has seemed slow to us. And now we understand why,” said Sen. Tim Kaine (D-VA), a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, adding that he “didn’t know” about Shanahan's ex-wife’s arrest for punching Shanahan in the face, nor his son’s arrest for attacking his mother with a baseball bat, until reports surfaced in USA Today and the Washington Post about the alleged incidents.

President Donald Trump nominated Shanahan, a former Boeing executive, for defense secretary in March 2019. Since then, his confirmation process lingered, leaving the Pentagon without a confirmed leader for the longest stretch in history and raising concerns among lawmakers who were told that the postponement was partly because of a hold up by the FBI. At least one of those lawmakers called for an investigation on Tuesday as to why they had not been told by the administration about Shanahan’s past.

“I want to know what was known, and whether it was fully disclosed,” Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), who also sits on the armed services committee, told The Daily Beast. “It was material to this nomination when he was proposed for deputy secretary, as well as named his nominee as secretary, although the full paperwork was never sent to us.”

The administration is supposed to turn over all relevant docs pertaining to a nominee’s background check. But that didn’t happen, according to a former Senate Armed Services Committee staffer.

“This never came up the first time around [when Shanahan was nominated to be Deputy Defense Secretary in 2017]. Trust me, I’d remember. And the FBI vetting process is thorough. We would routinely get things like a nominee who had tried coke once in the 1980s,” the ex-staffer told The Daily Beast.

“If these domestic issues are as serious as being reported, SASC would have been told,” the ex-staffer added. “And I would know. Which leads me to conclude that this stuff was never reported to the committee. Not sure why that happened, but I see no other explanation.”

Shanahan announced Tuesday that he would no longer seek to be confirmed as Defense Secretary and would be resigning from his post at the Pentagon. The news came as reports surfaced that he had downplayed his son’s assault on his ex-wife, and that both he and his ex-wife had both claimed, back in 2010, that they had been punched in the face by the other after drinking. Part of the altercation reportedly took place in front of their home in Seattle. USA Today obtained recordings from the night of the incident.

“My husband is throwing punches at me,” Shanahan’s ex-wife Kimberly Jordinson told a 911 offcer, according to USA Today. “He’s been hitting me… I don’t need a medic, I need you guys to get him out of the house… He’s just swinging punches at me.”

Shanahan maintains that he never “laid a hand on” his former wife.

“After having been confirmed for Deputy Secretary less than two years ago, it is unfortunate that a painful and deeply personal family situation from long ago is being dredged up and painted in an incomplete and therefore misleading way,” Shanahan said in a statement Tuesday. “I believe my continuing in the confirmation process would force my three children to relive a traumatic chapter in our family's life.”

In the case of high level appointees like secretary of defense, FBI investigators are able to marshal more resources for a more detailed background check than most civil servants would normally get. “They do up to about 40 face-to-face interviews,” said John Berry, an attorney who represents clients in security clearance cases, said. “A normal person with a top secret clearance, they may come and talk to like five or ten folks.”

Attorneys say that, absent any more revelations about Shanahan, the domestic violence allegations against his wife and son would probably not have stopped most applicants from getting a clearance, assuming investigators knew about them.

“The reason this probably slipped through is because, as far as I can tell, Shanahan was never charged with anything. So nothing would’ve popped up in a national criminal database check,” said Brad Moss, a national security lawyer with extensive experience handling clearance cases.

Shanahan’s resignation comes at a particularly fraught time for the Defense Department. Officials there are in the midst of dealing with increasing escalations with Tehran, and on Monday the administration announced that it was prepared to send an additional 1,000 troops to the Middle East to counter Iran’s presence in the region. Amid the absence of a confirmed secretary, the State Department has lead the way on Iran policy, crafting the maximum pressure campaign along with Treasury that’s led to more than a thousand sanctions designations against the country. State has also held briefings with Congress about Iran over the last several weeks.

While Tuesday’s revelations caught many lawmakers by surprise, others said they had been made aware of them before they were reported publicly.

“I know he’s been accused of things for a long time… he also is, keep in mind, he went to confirmation as the deputy. So that’s a process,” said Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-OK), the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee.

A senior White House official told The Daily Beast that Shanahan’s withdrawal has been expected for “a couple weeks” in light of the incidents, reports of which had been circulating internally.

“One concern was it would turn into another Kavanaugh situation,” the official said, referring to the highly contentious confirmation fight over the Supreme Court Justice. The White House anticipated that Senate Democrats might seize on reports of domestic problems in Shanahan’s home to attempt to tie him to the larger problem of domestic violence in the military.

Of particular concern, the White House official said, was Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), a member of the Armed Services Committee, Democratic presidential candidate, and longtime critic of the Pentagon’s handling of sexual assault and abuse cases against female service members. Though not directly analogous to the litany of documented cases of such assaults, reports about Shanahan’s private life, the White House worried, might hand Gillibrand and like-minded committee Democrats a cudgel to wield against Shanahan’s nomination.

Shanahan’s replacement, Mark Esper, is currently the secretary of the Army and has a long history of working in top positions in the military and with government contractors, including Raytheon. Those who’ve known Esper over the years say he has the attitude of an entrenched bureaucrat who is eager to please his bosses.

“He was one of the top five guys in our class and he is highly regarded in the Trump administration,” said one former senior Pentagon official who attended school with Esper. Esper was also a classmate of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point in 1986.

“He is very good at figuring out what his superior wants and he delivers,” the former official said. “And Mark’s approach to his work is to focus on the core mission in front of him—to prevail against the U.S.’s competitors. And he knows in this case those rivals are Russia and China.”

Homeland Security: We've tested Windows BlueKeep attack and it works so patch now,https://www.zdnet.com,['Liam Tung'],,,,https://www.zdnet.com/article/homeland-security-weve-tested-windows-bluekeep-attack-and-it-works-so-patch-now/,"A single actor is scanning Windows systems vulnerable to the BlueKeep flaw A threat actor hidden behind Tor nodes is scanning for Windows systems vulnerable to BlueKeep flaw. Read more: https://zd.net/2JWjK73

The Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) cybercrime emergency response team is warning Windows admins to patch the wormable BlueKeep flaw, after confirming it can be used to remotely execute code on vulnerable PCs.

The US government's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has raised the official alert over a potentially devastating flaw that affects the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) service in multiple versions of Windows, from Windows 2000 to Windows 2008.

Microsoft considered CVE-2019-0708, now known as BlueKeep, so severe that it even released a patch for unsupported Windows XP – a measure it hadn't taken since WannaCry wreaked havoc across the globe in mid-2017.

The bug was reported to Microsoft ahead of its May Patch Tuesday update by the UK's National Cyber Security Centre, the organization under UK spy agency GCHQ tasked with improving the nation's cybersecurity defenses in the public and private sector.

Microsoft released patches for XP because it believed BlueKeep's worm capabilities – the ability to automatically spread from one vulnerable machine to another – could be exploited in an attack on the same global scale as WannaCry, whose worm capabilities were enabled by EternalBlue, the leaked NSA exploit for the SMBv1 file-sharing protocol.

The NSA is also worried about BlueKeep. Earlier this month it urged admins to patch the flaw and change configurations to prevent potential attacks. Its warning followed research that found that at least one million Windows computers were still vulnerable to BlueKeep. The NSA said it was ""likely only a matter of time"" before attacks emerged.

Currently there's no publicly available exploit code for BlueKeep. However, several organizations claim to have developed exploits for it, including Zerodium, McAfee, Kaspersky, Check Point, MalwareTech, and Valthek.

CISA on Monday confirmed it has successfully exploited BlueKeep on a Windows 2000 PC. The agency has not tested other affected versions of Windows.

""CISA tested BlueKeep against a Windows 2000 machine and achieved remote code execution. Windows OS versions prior to Windows 8 that are not mentioned in this Activity Alert may also be affected; however, CISA has not tested these systems,"" it said.

However, CISA has since stepped back from that claim and replaced its original statement with: ""CISA has coordinated with external stakeholders and determined that Windows 2000 is vulnerable to BlueKeep.""

Nonetheless, its advice, like the NSA's and Microsoft's, remains the same: apply Microsoft's May fixes for the RDP BlueKeep bug. Similarly, it recommends enabling Network Level Authentication (NLA), which would shield organizations from any forthcoming BlueKeep attacks. And it suggests blocking TCP port 3389, which is used to start an RDP session.

Should a public BlueKeep exploit emerge or nation-state hackers develop one privately and decide to use it, the potential impact could be very different to WannaCry.

That malware heavily damaged organizations in Europe, most notably the UK's National Health Service (NHS), which faced a $125m WannaCry bill, was forced to cancel 19,000 appointments, and then spent £500,000 on contractors to restore data in the wake of the attack.

Additionally, thanks to suspected Russian state-backed hacking group, ShadowBrokers, public exploit code was available just a month after Microsoft's patch.

Security firm BitSight ran an internet scan in mid-June for systems vulnerable to BlueKeep. It too found about a million vulnerable machines, but the exposure to BlueKeep is greatest in China, where less than 50 percent of machines have been patched.

China by far has the most machines in the world that are vulnerable to BlueKeep, amounting to about a third of the million vulnerable machines. It is followed by the US, but more than 75 percent of US machines have been patched.

It seems Europe has learned its lessons from WannaCry and the subsequent EternalBlue-powered NotPetya outbreak. The UK, Netherlands, Germany, France, have all patched over 75 percent of systems with exposed RDP hosts.

Countries in the same bracket as China, with less than 50 percent of machines patched, include South Korea and Hong Kong, while the patch rate in Russia, India, Brazil, and Italy sits between 50 percent and 75 percent.

"U.S. Justice Dept. keeps Manafort in federal custody, citing health, personal safety",https://www.reuters.com,"['Karen Freifeld', 'Min Read']",06-18-2019,2019,6,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-manafort/us-justice-department-keeps-manafort-in-federal-custody-citing-health-personal-safety-idUSKCN1TJ1N6,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Convicted felon Paul Manafort will remain in federal custody, a U.S. Justice Department official said on Tuesday, citing concerns about the “health and personal safety” of President Donald Trump’s former campaign chairman if he was transferred to a local facility in New York.

FILE PHOTO: U.S. President Trump's former campaign manager Paul Manafort arrives at a hearing at U.S. District Court in Washington, U.S., January 16, 2018. REUTERS/Yuri Gripas/File Photo

Manafort, serving a 7-1/2-year sentence for tax fraud, bank fraud and other charges stemming from Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia probe, faces New York state charges related to residential mortgage fraud, conspiracy and falsifying business records.

The veteran Republican political operative had been expected to be transferred any day from a federal prison in Pennsylvania to a New York City-operated jail to face the state charges.

But Manafort, 70, was transferred on Monday to the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC), a federal facility in Manhattan. On Tuesday, The Bureau of Prisons’ website showed Manafort was there.

In a statement, a senior Justice Department official said Manafort’s attorneys told the Bureau of Prisons they were concerned about “his health and personal safety” in local custody.

New York prosecutors did not object to the move, which would make Manafort available to the state when needed, according to letters obtained by Reuters.

“In light of New York’s position, and Mr. Manafort’s unique health and safety needs, the department determined to err on the side of caution by keeping Mr. Manafort in federal custody during the pendency of his state proceedings,” the official said. “This arrangement will not have any impact on his state proceedings.”

It is not clear if Manafort will remain at the MCC or return to Pennsylvania following his arraignment.

The MCC, which houses around 800 inmates, is where drug kingpin “El Chapo” is behind bars. Other criminals who have spent time there include Ponzi schemer Bernard Madoff, mob boss John Gotti, and “Blind Sheikh” militant Omar Abdel-Rahman.

In a May letter sent to the warden of FCI Loretto, the low-security federal prison in Pennsylvania where Manafort was housed before the transfer, Manafort’s lawyer said his client had suffered “health challenges” that would “best be addressed” by remaining at Loretto.

If transferred to New York, Manafort would likely be kept in solitary confinement at Rikers Island, a city jail that is “unsecure, unsanitary and dangerous,” attorney Todd Blanche wrote.

U.S. Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen, the Justice Department’s new No. 2 under Attorney General William Barr, sent a copy of the letter to Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance on June 11.

Vance replied that his office never said Manafort should be kept at Rikers or placed in solitary confinement, according to a copy of his letter.

Manafort should be turned over to New York state or kept in a federal facility in New York City, but Vance’s office said it would not object if he were housed in Pennsylvania.

The U.S. Bureau of Prisons did not respond to a request for comment.

Rudy Giuliani, a lawyer for Trump, said it was a “perfectly appropriate exercise of power by federal authorities” to keep Manafort in federal custody.

“Rikers Island sounds like a punitive measure,” Giuliani said. He declined to comment on whether Trump had any say in the decision.

Trump has not ruled out an eventual pardon for Manafort. However, any presidential pardon would apply only to federal crimes and not to any state convictions.

Former federal prosecutor Roland Riopelle said Manafort’s situation was unique because he is an “ally of the president.”

“The agreement to keep Manafort in federal custody while he is being prosecuted in the state is, in my experience, unusual,” Riopelle said, though he added that it also was unusual to have dual prosecutions like Manafort’s.

Riopelle cautioned that the MCC was no walk in the park.

“It’s a high-security federal prison with very little opportunity for outdoor exercise,” Riopelle said."
Microsoft launches four games that users can play with their eyes,https://www.neowin.net,['João Carrasqueira'],,,,https://www.neowin.net/news/microsoft-launches-four-games-that-users-can-play-with-their-eyes/,"Microsoft has been investing in accessibility for its products in a number of ways, including the Xbox Adaptive Controller last year. One notable accessibility improvement came to Windows 10 a couple of years ago, when Microsoft added native support for eye-tracking technology to the OS, enabling a whole new navigation experience built around the user's eyes.

It's been some time since we've heard of more news on this front, but today, Microsoft announced a range of new ""Eyes First"" games that are now available on the Microsoft Store. The games are essentially re-engineered versions of well-known games, built to be played exclusively with eye control.

The four titles are Tile Slide, in which players need to drag around tiles with numbers on them, reorganizing them to be in order; Match Two, which, as the name suggests, has the user try to find two matching pictures in a grid of hidden images; Double Up, based on the 2048 title that made waves a few years ago; and Maze, where the player simply needs to find the way through a labyrinth.

You can download the games from the Microsoft through the links above, and if you're interested, you can build your own games using Windows 10 eye-tracking APIs detailed here."

Bond yields bounce off multiyear lows after Trump tweets he'll meet with China's Xi,https://www.cnbc.com,['Thomas Franck'],06-18-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/18/us-bonds-treasury-yields-tick-lower-ahead-of-federal-reserve-meeting.html,"The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell to its lowest level since September 2017 on Tuesday as the Federal Reserve began its two-day policy meeting and European Central Bank President Mario Draghi promised further stimulus if inflation doesn't meet its target in the euro zone.

Yields moved off their lows later Tuesday morning after President Donald Trump tweeted that he will be meeting with China's Xi Jinping at the G-20 summit next week.

By 4:30 p.m. ET, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note had fallen to 2.056%, off a 20-month low of 2.016% hit earlier in the session. The yield on the 2-year Treasury note rose to 1.864% while the rate on the 3-month bill hovered at 2.226%.

While the Fed is expected to leave the key interest rates unchanged in its June meeting, many expect the Chair Jerome Powell to telegraph easier monetary policy ahead during Wednesday's press conference. His comments at 2:30 p.m. ET will follow the release of the central bank's decision at 2 p.m.

Softer economic gauges like May's anemic jobs report and a lackluster consumer pricing print convinced many economists and fixed-income traders earlier this month that the central bank will hint at its ability to lower borrowing costs if needed.

""I think they should cut rates, and I think the discussion should instead be whether to cut 25 basis points or 50 basis points,"" said Jim Bianco, head of the Chicago-based advisory firm Bianco Research. ""But they'll probably do what they usually do, which is wait until it's too late.""

""The market has been very vocal of its pricing of expected inflation,"" he added. ""The only thing transitory is Powell's use of the word 'transitory,'"" he said, referring to the Fed chair's characterization of sluggish inflation as a temporary blip.

""We say in our statement of longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy that the Committee would be concerned if inflation were running persistently above or below 2%,"" Powell said last month.

""And in this case, as we look at these readings in the first quarter for core, we do see good reasons to think that some were or all of the unexpected decrease may wind up being transient,"" he added.

Traders are now pricing in a more than 80% chance of a rate cut in July and 70% probability of another reduction in September, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool.

Meanwhile, ECB President Draghi said Tuesday that the central bank may need to ease monetary policy again over the coming months, possibly through new rate cuts or asset purchases, if inflation doesn't bounce back toward its target.

""In the absence of improvement, such that the sustained return of inflation to our aim is threatened, additional stimulus will be required,"" Draghi said.

The central bank foresees ""lingering softness"" on the horizon, exacerbated by geopolitical factors and trade disputes that have dampened exports and softened manufacturing."
"State Department cuts new funds to El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, pending immigration fixes",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/el-salvador-guatemala-honduras-funds-state-department-immigration-fixes,"The State Department announced Monday it will cut new foreign aid to the ""Northern Triangle"" countries -- Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador -- unless their governments take ""concrete action"" to stem the flow of migrants towards the United States.

The aggressive move came less than two weeks after the Trump administration reached a last-minute deal with Mexico, which called for the country's deployment of more troops to its own southern border and tighter asylum protocols. The U.S. and Mexico reached the accord shortly before the White House was set to impose a series of escalating tariffs on its southern neighbor.

President Trump previously pushed in March to cut $615 million in aid to the Northern Triangle, noting that the nations have been home to some of the migrant caravans that have marched through Mexico to the U.S. border to claim asylum, in some cases fraudulently.

On further review, the State Department said the administration has decided to continue to provide $432 million for anti-gang, education, and health initiatives. U.S. officials said the review looked at roughly 700 projects funded with fiscal 2017 money by the United States in the three countries and concluded that a significant number were too far advanced to end them.

MEXICO VOWS TO HELP CENTRAL AMERICAN MIGRANTS AMID CRACKDOWN

However, the latest plans showed roughly $370 million from the fiscal year 2018 budget will no longer be spent on the Northern Triangle and approximately $185 million in funding from the 2017 budget will be withheld, at least for now.

A State Department official told Fox News a re-evaluation would be concluded no later than April 2020.

""We will not provide new funds for programs in those countries until we are satisfied that the Northern Triangle governments are taking concrete actions to reduce the number of migrants coming to the U.S. border,"" State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said. ""This is consistent with the president’s direction and with the recognition that it is critical that there be sufficient political will in these countries to address the problem at its source.""

She added, ""Working with Congress, we will reprogram those funds to other priorities as appropriate.""

Ortagus noted that ""previously awarded grants and contracts will continue with current funding.""

Many Democrats called the decision callous and unproductive.

""As feared, a presidential tantrum will limit our nation’s ability to actually help address the challenges forcing people to flee to the U.S.,"" Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., tweeted.

The Northern Triangle's immigration policies have long rankled the Trump administration. Last December, the U.S. pledged more than $10 billion in aid to Central America and Mexico to help keep migrants put. Later that month, Trump tweeted: ""...Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador are doing nothing for the United States but taking our money.

""Word is that a new Caravan is forming in Honduras and they are doing nothing about it,"" Trump added. ""We will be cutting off all aid to these 3 countries -- taking advantage of U.S. for years!""

The State Department in March then notified Congress that it would look to suspend 2017 and 2018 payments to the trio of nations.

Meanwhile, Mexico has offered refuge to migrants with credible fears as thousands remain in the country while they await court dates for asylum petitions in the U.S. The understaffed and underfunded Mexican refugee commission has faced a backlog of cases.

But, in recent months, police and immigration have stepped up enforcement in southern Mexico, setting up highway checkpoints, raiding a caravan of mostly Central American migrants and trying to keep people off the northbound train known as ""the beast.""

At the same time, Mexicans have grown increasingly intolerant of the large numbers of migrants passing through their country in an attempt to reach the United States.

A June poll in Mexican newspaper El Universal showed that Mexicans are less receptive to allowing undocumented migrants to come in, or to stay on permanently as refugees, than they were in October, when caravans with thousands of Central American migrants were winding their way north.

First on CNN: Controversial political appointee expected to be named Customs and Border Protection press secretary,https://www.cnn.com,['Geneva Sands'],06-18-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/18/politics/katharine-gorka-customs-and-border-protection/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Katharine Gorka, a political appointee at the Department of Homeland Security who has stirred controversy for her views on terrorism and her role in the department's efforts to combat violent extremism in the US, is expected to be the new press secretary at Customs and Border Protection.

Acting CBP Commissioner John Sanders told CNN Tuesday that Gorka is expected to take the position and he advocated for her to join the agency.

The move comes as President Donald Trump continues his rhetoric against undocumented immigrants and the increasing number of migrants crossing the southern border and claiming asylum.

Customs and Border Protection is the agency responsible for policing the US borders and facilitating legal trade and travel. It is also the frontline agency dealing with the surge of migrants at the southern border. If Gorka steps into this new role, she will be taking on the public face of the agency at the center of the President's attention, which has been struggling with capacity and resource issues.

The Department of Homeland Security has also seen a major turnover in senior staff in the wake of Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen's forced departure in April. Several CBP officials joined Kevin McAleenan at DHS headquarters when he was named acting Homeland Security secretary.

In response to a request for comment on her new post, Gorka told CNN Tuesday, ""I am honored for this opportunity to serve at CBP.""

Gorka is married to Sebastian Gorka, the former deputy assistant to Trump, who was an outspoken and combative defender of the President's national security agenda, known for his dire warnings of Islamic terrorism while writing for Breitbart.

Sebastian Gorka left the White House in August 2017, in the wake of chief White House strategist Steve Bannon's forced departure.

Both Gorkas wrote for Breitbart, where Bannon served as an executive before and after his time at the White House.

In a 2014, Breitbart story, Katharine Gorka, under the name Katie Gorka, wrote that ""Presidents Bush and Obama both publicly declared Islam to be a religion of peace, which has struck a sour chord for many. ""

""To date, American and Western leaders have preemptively shut down any debate within Islam by declaring that Islam is the religion of peace and that terrorism has nothing to do with Islam,"" she wrote

In another 2014 article, she wrote that the Obama administration ""narrowly defined the enemy as only the most violent jihadists: first Al Qaeda and now ISIS.""

""This inaccurate assessment of the enemy has its roots in left-wing theories about social movements,"" she wrote in part.

Gorka has supporters within the administration and department and was recommended by various people for the DHS policy job. ""She was very good at her job and is very intelligent,"" said the senior official about her time at DHS.

Gorka, who has been with the Trump administration since its beginning, was under consideration to lead the new DHS terrorism prevention office, but was not offered the position, according to two sources. An administration official said DHS did not want her past controversies to be a distraction from the work of the department.

While at DHS, she worked in the policy office on what is known as ""countering violent extremism"" issues, according to the official. Countering violent extremism efforts have historically been associated with preventing individuals from radicalizing and joining or carrying out attacks on behalf of Islamic terror groups, but some activity has been focused on thwarting threats from domestic terror movements, like white nationalist extremists.

In August 2017, the Huffington Post reported that Gorka and other aides worked to eliminate a DHS grant for Life After Hate, which would have been used to expand its outreach and intervention services for former white supremacists and others in the ""criminal underground."" Earlier that summer, DHS, under the leadership of then-DHS Secretary John Kelly, cut some organizations out of grant money to counter violent extremism -- including nearly a dozen that the Obama administration considered worthy of receiving the funds.

A DHS official also previously told the Huffington Post that the department, and Gorka, ""has a productive relationship with (Life After Hate) and has recently met and participated in events with its new leadership.""

A DHS spokesperson told CNN, ""Katie has been a valuable member of the DHS team, helping to advance the department's mission of preventing targeted violence and countering terrorism, regardless of ideology. We look forward to her continued service with the department in her new position at CBP as we work to secure the border and enforce our nation's immigration laws.""

In March, the legal watchdog group Democracy Forward sued the department for records detailing Gorka's role as a senior adviser at DHS, after it was unsuccessful with a Freedom of Information Act request.

""The public deserves to know what Katharine Gorka is doing at DHS, but the Trump administration isn't saying,"" said Democracy Forward spokeswoman Charisma Troiano at the time. ""We're suing to find out whether her extreme and biased views are driving Homeland Security resources away from real threats.""

Troiano said that the organization has yet to receive records and the lawsuit is ongoing.

Earlier this year, American Oversight also requested records from the department for Gorka ""to shed light on DHS counterterrorism efforts.""

""Katharine Gorka, an advisor in DHS's policy office has a long history of working with far-right national security groups, and her writings have been described as anti-Muslim in sentiment,"" wrote Executive Director Austin Evers in a letter to DHS in January.

It is unclear if the press secretary role has been finalized or when Gorka will begin at CBP. The agency's last press secretary left in March to join the communications team at the Environmental Protection Agency."

Pete Buttigieg, a breakout 2020 Democratic candidate, said that it's ""statistically almost certain"" the US has had a gay president in the past.

Speaking to ""Axios on HBO"" on Sunday, Buttigieg defended himself against critics who say he would be too young, liberal, or gay to be elected commander-in-chief.

""People will elect the person who will make the best president,"" he said. ""And we have had excellent presidents who have been young. We have had excellent presidents who have been liberal. I would imagine we've probably had excellent presidents who were gay — we just didn't know which ones.""

""Statistically, it's almost certain,"" he added.

According to the Williams Institute at UCLA School of Law, 9.8% of Washington D.C. identifies as LGBT, the highest of any US state. Gallup estimated that 4.5% of the US population identifies as LGBT in 2017.

When asked whether he could point to historically which president may have been gay, Buttigieg said his ""gaydar"" was not well tuned.

"‘Human capital crisis’ at EPA, retirement for 40% of staff",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],06-18-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/washington-secrets/human-capital-crisis-at-epa-retirement-for-40-of-staff,"The Environmental Protection Agency is bleeding workers.

“I do have a concern absolutely. Forty percent of our workforce is eligible to retire over the next five years. While I don’t expect them all to retire in the next five years, I expect them to be gone in the next 10 years,” said Administrator Andrew Wheeler.

“I consider it a human capital crisis,” he added.

The issue is one being felt throughout government and business as baby boomers retire and younger workers come and go with much more regularity.

Wheeler, for example, said the EPA has always budgeted for workers to stay for decades. “We have a history at the agency of hiring people out of school and expecting them to stay 30, 40 years. We have 10 employees who have been here 49 years,” he said in an interview.

But that’s not happening anymore.

And, he added, government rules make it hard to start looking for a new employee before a retiring worker leaves the building. “You lose that institutional knowledge because they aren’t there to train their replacement.""

The White House, he said, is trying to give agencies more flexibility in hiring. But Wheeler said he is also taking charge, noting that he helped in the interviewing process of new EPA human resources director.

“Administrators don’t typically interview at that level,” he said, but added, “I want to meet who we’re going to hire before we hire them because on Day One I’m going to hit them with a dozen things and I want to make sure that they don’t get scared off.”"

Last week, it was at it again.

On Thursday, the Agriculture Department announced a decision to relocate two of its research agencies, the Economic Research Service and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, from Washington to the Kansas City region. The Economic Research Service, which investigates the economics of food, farming, natural resources and rural America, and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, which was established as part of the Food, Conservation and Energy Act of 2008, play a key role in providing the data essential for honest policy-making.

Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue initially declared an intention to move these sub-agencies 10 months ago but didn’t specify a location then. The USDA now says the move would put the agencies closer to the agricultural heartland while saving money both for taxpayers and for employees, because Washington is an expensive city. While the rationale may seem plausible , in reality the implications are worrying.

In theory, there’s no reason such agencies couldn’t function well in Kansas City or elsewhere. After all, as with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention headquarters in Atlanta, this would hardly be the first time a government agency operates from beyond Washington. But the way this operation has been managed, with insufficient warning and explanation, suggests an intention by the administration to encourage qualified analysts to leave government and stifle independent and objective research.

If carried out, the move will disrupt ongoing scientific research and displace several hundred federal employees with valuable experience. Since the abrupt announcement last August, many of the agencies’ top economists and scientists have quit.

The investigations carried out by these agencies have long underpinned decisions by Congress and by American farmers, much as research from the Bureau of Labor Statistics underpins decisions in others parts of the economy. And much of the information produced by the Economic Research Service has indeed been inconvenient for the administration, as it has illustrated the ills wrought by President Trump’s trade wars and how small farmers were helped only marginally by the 2017 Republican tax overhaul.

Democratic members of the House and Senate have introduced the Agriculture Research Integrity Act, which would bar the move. They are right to do so, but it would be best if the USDA took the hint and retreated from this abrupt and ill-considered relocation. The better way to get sunnier data would be to develop better policies."
Mississippi’s Mental-Illness Policies Are Working. DOJ Is Challenging Them.,https://www.nationalreview.com,"['John Hirschauer', 'John Fund', 'Alexandra Desanctis', 'Andrew C.

The state is leading a quiet revolt.

Despite having the highest poverty rate in the United States, Mississippi has the nation’s lowest rate of homelessness. But instead of heralding Mississippi’s success and imploring other states to follow its lead, the Department of Justice is taking formal legal action against the state’s highly effective method of delivering mental-health services.

Back in 2016, DOJ filed a formal complaint against the state, alleging that its approach to mental health “has resulted in [the] repeated, prolonged, and unnecessary institutionalization [of the mentally ill] in state-run psychiatric hospitals, and placed them at serious risk of such institutionalization, in violation of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.” The complaint and ensuing legal challenges brought both sides before U.S. District Judge Carlton Reeves early this month, and the judge rejected the state’s motion to dismiss the case. The case raises a series of questions about the limits of federal oversight and the jurisdictional authority of states and localities.

Mississippi is one of the few states in the country to retain a state mental-hospital network as an integral part of its mental-health system. While every state has public or private mental institutions, most have relegated their hospitals to ancillary roles, available only to treat a small handful of hard cases and forensic patients. As a result, the most seriously mentally ill, who often require institutional services, have been forced into inappropriate placements in the community. Many end up homeless, incarcerated, or as frequent patients in already-crowded emergency rooms. Mississippi has stood firm in its provision of a robust network of inpatient services for the mentally ill, much to the dismay of the Department of Justice. DOJ is apparently unsatisfied with the carnage deinstitutionalization has wrought on communities across the country and is attempting to force Mississippi to alter its approach to treating its most vulnerable citizens.

DOJ’s complaint letter accuses Mississippi of violating the terms of the landmark 1999 Supreme Court case Olmstead vs. L.C., which held that the state of Georgia had violated the Americans with Disabilities Act in its refusal to offer community-based services to two mentally ill complainants for whom the state’s experts deemed such a transfer clinically appropriate. In Mississippi, the DOJ isn’t bringing forth an analogous case; the complaint is not filed on behalf of a specific aggrieved party, but is instead directed at the entire statewide treatment apparatus for its alleged failure to protect “the rights of adults with mental illness to receive services in the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs.” DOJ is attempting to force Mississippi to restructure its entire mental-health system.

The original Olmstead decision, authored by Ruth Bader Ginsburg, was far more balanced than DOJ portends. The decision compelled states to offer individuals with mental disabilities access to community-based services, subject to three substantial qualifications.

First, the transfer of individuals from “institutions” to less structured environments must be formally approved by the state’s medical professionals, who are required to “have determined that community placement is appropriate” for the affected individual. Ginsburg drew explicit boundaries around the scope of the community mandate, quoting the American Psychiatric Association:

“Some individuals, whether mentally retarded or mentally ill, are not prepared at particular times — perhaps in the short run, perhaps in the long run — for the risks and exposure of the less protective environment of community settings”; for these persons, “institutional settings are needed and must remain available.”

Ginsburg also made clear that “nothing in the ADA or its implementing regulations condones termination of institutional settings for persons unable to handle or benefit from community settings.”

This last clause — “unable to handle or benefit from community settings” — has been occasionally inverted to assert that no one needs institutional services. Deena Fox, an attorney in DOJ’s Civil Rights Division, has not explicitly called for Mississippi to cease all institutional services, but she has promised that “evidence at trial will make clear that individuals with serious mental illness can be appropriately served in the community.” Some individuals with severe mental illness can be served in the community, of course, to different degrees and at different times. But the objection of the DOJ is principally much deeper than that.

Attorney Bill Choslovsky, who has fought similarly obstreperous Olmstead-based litigation in the state of Illinois, calls the logical terminus of DOJ’s argument a “leeches” hypothesis. Just as leeches are viewed as an intrinsically inappropriate medical device — it would be malpractice to use leeches to treat any conceivable disease — the DOJ is trying to impose its view that institutionalization is medically inappropriate per se by asserting medical authority that it doesn’t have. The analogy is wrong on the merits: According to Dr. E. Fuller Torrey in his book American Psychosis, 15 psychiatric experts were empaneled in 2008 to examine the minimum number of public psychiatric beds necessary to deal with those who inevitably fall through the cracks of the community system. This includes beds necessary for both the acutely ill (those suffering temporary suicidal or homicidal impulses, psychotic breaks, or other aggravated psychiatric phenomena) and the small but significant number of profoundly ill individuals who, in Olmstead’s phrasing, are not prepared “for the risks and exposure of the less protective environment of community settings” in the long run. The panel arrived at between 40–60 public psychiatric beds per 100,000 population, presuming adequate outpatient services.

The second qualifier that Olmstead made to its community-services mandate maintains that “the transfer from institutional care to a less restrictive setting” must not be “opposed by the affected individual.” Olmstead imparts no duty for patients to forgo services they are currently receiving, even if they are qualified to be in a less intensive care environment.

Finally — and this is the qualification most pertinent to Mississippi’s affirmative defense — the majority opinion insisted that for a community placement to occur, it must be “reasonably accommodated, taking into account the resources available to the State and the needs of others with mental disabilities.” This begets the “fundamental alteration” defense, which traces itself back to the original language of the ADA (emphasis mine):

A public entity shall make reasonable modifications in policies, practices, or procedures when the modifications are necessary to avoid discrimination on the basis of disability, unless the public entity can demonstrate that making the modifications would fundamentally alter the nature of the service, program, or activity.

Mississippi’s attorneys insist that the Department of Justice is demanding adherence to what amounts to a limitless and arbitrary standard. Mississippi already has community-based mental health services, though proportionately fewer than its peers. Every other state retains some degree of institutional services, and many of them have avoided DOJ litigation. The DOJ, then, is taking issue with the proportion of individuals who receive institutional services, which raises the question: How much is enough? In the absence of a specific claimant who can demonstrate harm under the Olmstead guidelines, how many hospitals must Mississippi close to meet the undefined and interminable demands of DOJ? And how does this not amount to a “fundamental alteration” of the balance of services that the state already provides?

Because of the nature of public finance and the budgetary strictures of state government, the state is making the laudable decision to orient their system towards treating the seriously mentally ill who require hospitalization; Mississippi has precisely nothing to apologize for.

Clarence Thomas’s dissent in Olmstead highlighted the imprecision with which the majority used the word “discrimination” to describe Georgia’s decision to treat patients in “an institutional setting after they became eligible for community placement.” He presciently noted that “by adopting such a broad view of discrimination, the majority drains the term of any meaning other than as a proxy for decisions disapproved of by this Court.” But even Ginsburg acknowledged an appellate court’s ruling that “the State’s duty to provide integrated services ‘is not absolute.’” States are allowed by Olmstead to preserve institutional settings necessary for the most severely ill, and the cost of preserving those settings may, in the fiscally limited world of state government, preclude those with less severe impairments from receiving commensurate services.

In his concurring opinion, Justice Kennedy warned that “it would be a tragic event . . . were the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 . . . to be interpreted so that States had some incentive, for fear of litigation, to drive those in need of medical care and treatment out of appropriate care and into settings with too little assistance and supervision.” This is precisely what the DOJ is doing. Mississippi is not a straggler to be dragged across deinstitutionalization’s finish line; the state is a necessary rebuke to policies that have relegated the severely mentally ill to lives of squalor and neglect on our nation’s streets and in our prisons."
House Homeland Security Republicans to introduce slew of cybersecurity bills,https://thehill.com,[],06-18-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/448971-house-homeland-security-republicans-to-introduce-slew-of-cybersecurity,"Republicans on the House Homeland Security Committee are gearing up to introduce a bevy of bills aimed at enhancing the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) cybersecurity capabilities.

The bills are the first glimpse into the new ""American Security Agenda"" that committee Republicans plan to pursue this Congress.

Rep. Mike Rogers Michael (Mike) Dennis RogersDem proposal to ban Pentagon funds for border wall survives House panel votes Dem proposal to ban Pentagon funds for border wall survives House panel votes House panel OKs space military branch MORE (R-Ala.), the ranking member of the Homeland Security Committee, will announce the agenda during remarks Tuesday afternoon at the International Summit on Borders in Washington, D.C.

Rogers will say that the goal of the agenda is to “take a hard look at the Department’s missions and act to ensure that DHS is prepared to tackle the emerging threats to our homeland,” including threats to social media, satellites and theft of intellectual property.

Republican members of the committee plan to introduce seven pieces of legislation in the coming weeks, with several specifically focused on cybersecurity.

Rep. Pete King Peter (Pete) Thomas KingGOP congressman: Trump should have been 'above' attacking Pelosi at Normandy Democratic lawmaker: Trump shouldn't be allowed to attend D-Day ceremony GOP lawmakers say Trump wrong to criticize Biden in Japan MORE (R-N.Y.) will reintroduce the Securing the Homeland Security Supply Chain Act, which would enable DHS to keep products from vendors that pose national security risks out of U.S. supply chains. This legislation was passed by the House during the last Congress, but stalled in the Senate. It had multiple bipartisan co-sponsors, including Homeland Security Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson Bennie Gordon ThompsonHillicon Valley: Lawmakers angered over Border Patrol breach | Senate Dems press FBI over Russian hacking response | Emails reportedly show Zuckerberg knew of Facebook's privacy issues | FCC looks to improve broadband mapping Hillicon Valley: Lawmakers angered over Border Patrol breach | Senate Dems press FBI over Russian hacking response | Emails reportedly show Zuckerberg knew of Facebook's privacy issues | FCC looks to improve broadband mapping Democrats grill FEMA over inflated payments for Hurricane Maria MORE (D-Miss.).

Rep. Debbie Lesko (R-Ariz.) will introduce the Pipeline Security Enhancement Act, which would give DHS’s Transportation Security Administration (TSA) the power to inspect and improve the physical security and cybersecurity of U.S. pipelines.

Three other bills set to be introduced by GOP Homeland Security committee members will include one to help TSA identify emerging threats to the transportation system, and others on reforming DHS’s structure and management.

Rogers will note in his speech that “these seven bills are just the start,” and that “we are working on other bills to address emerging threats that we hope to introduce soon as part of our agenda.”

A Homeland Security Committee aide told The Hill in a phone call that while timing for the formal reintroduction of these bills has not been set, some will be reintroduced “this week."" The aide emphasized that “we are not going to drop everything tomorrow,” and that the overall agenda outlined by Rogers will be “built out in the next 16 months.”

The aide said that Rogers and Thompson appear to be in agreement on most of the cybersecurity issues, noting that both congressmen are “very interested in making sure that DHS keeps up with nation states and hackers and making sure that our cyber infrastructure is secure.”

The Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee has also been consulted on the issues Rogers will outline, the aide confirmed to The Hill, noting that the chairmen and ranking members of both committees have met to discuss the agenda.

The aide said that both Rogers and Katko engage with DHS on a weekly basis, and that the committee’s job is “to make sure they [DHS] can do their job correctly.”

“Instead of changing the deck chairs on a sinking ship, we want to make sure that this a department that is fully engaged and prepared for the 21st century,” the aide said."
LI's congressional delegation calls on EPA to move faster on drinking water standards,https://www.newsday.com,['David M. Schwartz'],06-18-2019,2019,6,https://www.newsday.com/long-island/environment/drinking-water-standards-epa-1.32577711,"As the state prepares to recommend drinking water standards for emerging contaminants, Long Island’s congressional delegation called Tuesday for the federal government to set its own standards and help local governments pay for treatment.

“We ask the Environmental Protection Agency to act with urgency,” Rep. Kathleen Rice (D-Garden City) said at the Town of Hempstead's water department. “This situation requires increased technical support and financial support” for water providers.

Rice was joined by Reps. Peter King (R-Seaford), Lee Zeldin (R-Shirley) and Thomas Suozzi (D-Glen Cove); Nassau County Executive Laura Curran; Hempstead Supervisor Laura Gillen; environmental advocates and water providers.

The bipartisan turnout “shows this is a full-court press,” King said.

New York State has been developing drinking water standards for 1,4 dioxane; and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), which is found in firefighting foams, and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), which is used in manufacturing stain- and water-resistant materials.

Earlier this month, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo told Newsday it was a “matter of weeks” before the state Department of Health released its recommended drinking water standards. That would trigger a monthslong public comment period before the standard becomes enforceable.

Local water providers face massive cleanup costs to remove 1,4-dioxane, PFOS and PFOA, which scientists have linked to negative health effects, including cancer, and have been detected in drinking water.

Long Island water providers have estimated it will cost $1.5 billion to remove the three emerging contaminants.

An analysis last month of federal data by the New York Public Interest Group found that Long Island’s drinking water had the most emerging contaminants in New York State.

Ty Fuller, chairman of the Long Island Water Conference, said the federal testing requirement didn't include communities served by smaller water providers such as upstate Hoosick Falls, which has been dealing with PFAS contamination in its drinking water.

“It’s not the most contaminated, it’s the most tested,” said Fuller, who is also Suffolk County Water Authority's director of strategic initiatives and lead hydrogeologist of Long Island's drinking water. “A lack of testing does not mean a lack of contamination.”

Elizabeth Moran, environmental policy director for the New York Public Interest Research Group, said, “The simple truth is Long Island’s sole source aquifer is susceptible to contamination because of a lot of development and industrial legacy.”

Adrienne Esposito, executive director of Citizens Campaign for the Environment, said, “We’re not just testing more here. We’re finding more here.”

The EPA has said it's studying the health effects of PFAS to determine a national drinking water standard.

EPA spokesman Elías Rodríguez said in a statement, ""EPA appreciates the congressional delegation’s interest and commitment to the community. EPA shares that commitment to protect public health and the environment and we are working to develop a response to the members.""

Zeldin criticized the EPA for not yet responding to a letter from the delegation sent June 7, asking for the agency to provide greater assistance to Long Island water providers. A federal standard would help Long Island authorities when dealing with federal agencies like the Department of Defense on issues like cleanup around military sites, he said.

Moran said the standards recommended in December by a panel of experts convened by Cuomo are not as stringent as the latest science suggests is necessary to protect public health."
In our opinion: The Department of Agriculture is moving workers to Kansas City. Utahns should hope they can be next,https://www.deseretnews.com,[],06-18-2019,2019,6,https://www.deseretnews.com/article/900075743/in-our-opinion-the-department-of-agriculture-is-moving-workers-to-kanas-city-utahns-should-hope-they-can-be-next-blm-usda.html,"Utah is still waiting to see whether the Trump administration decides to move its Bureau of Land Management headquarters here from Washington — a move that makes sense considering how most BLM decisions affect the West much more than any property along the Potomac.

Continuing this trend, the administration announced last week that economists and scientists at the Department of Agriculture will be relocated to Kansas City. This is another move that makes great sense, considering that bureaucracy’s effect on farmers concentrated in the heartland.

The good sense seemed lost on angry employees of the Economic Research Service and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, however. Many of them stood and turned their backs on Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue as he made the announcement last Thursday.

Frankly, they need to get over it. Those affected by federal decisions have little need for bureaucrats who want to cling to the power structure in Washington.

"" Those affected by federal decisions have little need for bureaucrats who want to cling to the power structure in Washington. ""

CNN cited concerns by employees who don’t want to be separated from the government they serve. That is a perfect example of the problem. They are supposed to serve the people, not the government.

That said, we sympathize with workers who would need to uproot their families, sell houses, leave friends and move to an entirely different part of the country. Such moves are not easy. Millions of people each year face decisions whether to go where their employer wants them to go or to find other work that would allow them to stay. These can be difficult choices, and we acknowledge that, unlike the BLM, where many workers already reside in various states, these agencies operate mainly in Washington. However, we have no doubt that Department of Agriculture employees will weather these changes as well as have others in various industries.

Critics worry about the loss of institutional knowledge if these agencies need to hire new people. This may be a valid concern, but it should be weighed against the possible gains of having fresh eyes with fresh ideas looking at old problems. Stagnation, entrenchment and an attitude of entitlement are bigger concerns in bureaucracies.

These agencies are supposed to produce nonpartisan reports and analyses. That should be as easy to do in Kansas City as it is in Washington, where politics permeate every crevice.

Administrations will shift from conservative to liberal and back again through the years. But having these agencies close to the people they serve will add a new level of accountability.

Besides all this, the move makes great economic sense. The department estimates a savings of $300 million over 15 years. Kansas City has more modest living costs and lower salaries than does Washington.

In addition, the move will be a boon to the Kansas City economy, adding many good-paying jobs.

Perhaps only a Washington bureaucrat could find fault with such a move. Utahns, meanwhile, should hope they soon can host the headquarters of the BLM. Spreading the federal government among the people is a capital idea."
DOJ lost track of dozens of foreign nationals in US to help law enforcement,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],06-17-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/doj-lost-track-of-dozens-of-foreign-nationals-in-u-s-to-help-law-enforcement,"A government watchdog investigation revealed the Justice Department lost track of dozens of foreign nationals who were brought to the U.S. and allowed to stay in the country to assist law enforcement.

The audit conducted by the DOJ’s inspector general, which spanned the end of the Obama administration and the beginning of Trump’s presidency, found that 62 of these foreign nationals had “absconded from DOJ control” and hundreds more weren’t being monitored properly.

DOJ sponsors the immigration of thousands of foreign nationals who might otherwise be inadmissible to the U.S. “due to their association with criminal enterprises.”

The new report, which scrutinized these DOJ immigration sponsorship programs, said these foreign nationals are useful to law enforcement because of “their access to criminal enterprises and ability to provide testimony in support of prosecution.” But there are “significant risks” involved as well, the report said, because the people in question “may be associated with criminal activity and motivated by the ability to reside temporarily in the United States.”

In addition to losing track of 62 foreign nationals, the audit also uncovered 18 instances where DOJ either didn’t renew or terminate their sponsorship of a foreign national properly “and therefore let the foreign nationals fall into an illegal status while residing in the United States.” The report said mistakes like that could result in “unnecessary, unexpected, and costly deportation of foreign nationals for whom DOJ had a continued need” and that the screw-ups could have “serious consequences for the investigations they were assisting.”

The Justice Department is supposed to work closely with the Department of Homeland Security in these sponsorship efforts, but the report described the DOJ’s faulty reporting mechanisms and poor communication with the DHS on this issue. The DOJ reported sponsoring 5,496 foreign nationals between fiscal 2015 and 2017, but the inspector general “identified over 1,000 DOJ-sponsored foreign nationals for whom DHS did not have current information” as of February 2018. According to the report, “DHS was still seeking information regarding 665 sponsorships” in August.

The two most common tools the DOJ uses in its sponsorship are the significant public benefit parole and deferred action. That type of parole permits a foreign national to enter the U.S. and stay on temporarily while being sponsored by law enforcement, while deferred action delays the deportation of a foreign national who isn’t in the U.S. legally. Two other types of sponsorship are S Visas, which allow foreign nationals to reside in the U.S. for three years while they cooperate with authorities on complex cases, and PL-110 sponsorship, which gives permanent legal residency to foreign nationals assisting in matters of national security overseas. Both of these are relatively rare.

The Drug Enforcement Agency and the FBI, which sponsored 2,380 foreign nationals and 3,059 foreign nationals during this time frame, respectively, are the DOJ agencies most heavily involved in the programs working with foreign nationals.

The DEA used parole 1,331 times and deferred action 1,033 times during this period, while the FBI used SPBPs 1,552 times and deferred action 1,433 times. The report said that “both ATF and FBI had policies that require the sponsoring special agent to immediately notify headquarters when a foreign national absconds” but that “there were no redundant methods to ensure that an absconsion is addressed immediately.”

“DOJ components must be vigilant in exercising their responsibilities for overseeing sponsored foreign nationals to fulfill their obligations to DHS, to protect the public, and to achieve their objectives of furthering investigations and prosecutions,” the inspector general report declared. “Therefore, effective oversight of these programs is essential.”

DOJ spokesman Alexei Woltornist told the Washington Examiner that “the Department of Justice is aware of the findings of the IG report and is working on remedying the problem.”

This isn’t the first time that problems like this have been uncovered inside the DOJ. A separate Justice Department inspector general investigation into the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives back in March 2017 revealed that the ATF “could not provide an accurate total number of ATF-sponsored foreign national informants.”

EPA will allow use of pesticide harmful to bees,https://thehill.com,[],06-17-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/448970-epa-will-allow-use-of-pesticide-harmful-to-bees,"The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) said Monday it will allow states to use a pesticide that is harmful to bees.

The agency made an emergency exception for 11 states to use sulfoxaflor on cotton and sorghum crops.

ADVERTISEMENT

“The only emergency here is the Trump EPA’s reckless approval of this dangerous bee-killing pesticide,” Lori Ann Burd, environmental health director at the Center for Biological Diversity, said in a statement. “It’s sickening that even amid the current insect apocalypse, the EPA’s priority is protecting pesticide industry profits.”

A study published in Nature last year found sulfoxaflor inhibited bumblebee reproduction.

According to the Center for Biological Diversity, the emergency declaration has been used for four consecutive years in most of the states.

Sulfoxaflor’s use was temporarily barred after a lawsuit from beekeepers in 2015, but the EPA in 2016 changed its instructions for how to use the pesticide in a way designed to reduce the impact on bees. Cotton and sorghum were not included in the directive.

The EPA’s Office of Inspector General wrote in a report last year that the agency did not have processes in place to determine how its emergency measures impact human and environmental health.

An EPA spokesperson said the emergency exemption was granted with public safety in mind, as well as the needs of farmers.

""This decision is based in part on information from the states demonstrating an urgent need and a lack of available alternatives to address the pest pressures within their states. Mitigation measures will be put in place to minimize exposure and reduce the potential for unreasonable risks to the environment. The approvals include advisory guidance for protecting bees, and users must also follow all existing EPA guidance for pollinator protection,"" an EPA spokesperson said."
Advocates ask Justice Department to investigate Euclid police over controversial use-of-force incidents,https://www.cleveland.com,"['Evan Macdonald', 'Emacdonald Cleveland.Com']",06-18-2019,2019,6,https://www.cleveland.com/crime/2019/06/advocates-ask-justice-department-to-investigate-euclid-police-over-controversial-use-of-force-incidents.html,"EUCLID, Ohio – A legal advocacy group sent a letter to the U.S. Justice Department on Tuesday requesting an investigation into the Euclid Police Department over a series of controversies, including an officer’s 2017 beating of a motorist that made national headlines.

The Legal Advocacy and Writ Resources Foundation says in the letter that the request is due to a “pattern of excessive and deadly force, police brutality, and intimidation” that deprives citizens of their rights. The letter lists at least seven events since 2016 that the LAWRS Foundation describes as excessive uses of force by police officers.

The six-page letter is signed by LAWRS Foundation President Cassandra McDonald and addressed to Steven Rosenbaum, the chief of the special litigation section of the Justice Department’s Office of Civil Rights.

The Justice Department could not immediately be reached for comment about the letter late Tuesday afternoon.

McDonald said she has been considering the request for a Justice Department investigation for roughly three years, and sent the letter Tuesday morning. She acknowledged the Justice Department may decline to investigate Euclid police department, but said she is hoping the letter will help spur reform efforts.

“I’m not hostile toward [Euclid’s] mayor. I’m not hostile toward the [city] council or anyone there. My problem is this has been going on for too long,” she said in a phone interview with cleveland.com.

The city of Euclid and its police department released a joint statement Tuesday afternoon, saying they “welcome full review and will cooperate fully with any investigation.”

Mayor Kirsten Holzheimer Gail’s office did not respond to a request for additional comment. A Euclid police spokesman said the department would not have any further comment beyond the joint statement.

The Euclid Police Department has been at the center of several high-profile controversies in recent years, several of which are listed in the LAWRS Foundation’s letter.

Among those is Euclid patrolman Michael Amiott’s violent arrest of Richard L. Hubbard during an August 2017 traffic stop. Video of the arrest showed Amiott knee Hubbard, tackle him to the ground and punch him in the face and body several times.

The video went viral online, and the city of Euclid fired Amiott in the wake of the incident. But an arbitrator overturned the firing last year and ordered the city to give Amiott’s job back.

Euclid has hired a special prosecutor to review the case and determine whether Amiott should face misdemeanor charges. Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Michael O’Malley’s office, which declined to charge Amiott with a felony, is also working with U.S. Attorney Justin Herdman’s office to decide whether to pursue federal charges against Amiott.

Hubbard also filed a civil lawsuit against the city of Euclid and its police department, which is pending in federal court.

Also listed in the letter is Euclid officer Matthew Rhodes’ fatal shooting of Luke O. Stewart during a March 2017 incident. Rhodes and his partner found Stewart asleep in a parked car, and Rhodes jumped into the car when Stewart tried to drive away.

Rhodes shot Stewart several times, saying he feared for his life because he felt Stewart may crash. A Cuyahoga County grand jury subsequently declined to bring criminal charges against Rhodes.

A federal judge also determined the shooting was justified when he ruled in Euclid’s favor in a civil lawsuit filed by Stewart’s family. But the judge chastised the Euclid Police Department for its training protocol, saying it exhibited a lackadaisical attitude about use-of-force training.

McDonald said Tuesday that she believes an investigation could lead to changes within the Euclid police department. Among the changes she’s seeking are the formation of a commission, including citizens and government officials, that has subpoena power to conduct its own investigations into controversial incidents.

“It just had to be done,” she said about the letter she sent the Justice Department. “I don’t know what the outcome is going to be, but I think it will put them on further alert.”

The request represents a likely uphill climb since the Trump Administration all but abandoned the Obama-era U.S. Department of Justice Department’s focus on civil-rights issues at local police departments. The city of Cleveland’s police department entered into a federal agreement with the Justice Department in 2015 that mandated reforms throughout the department.

Housing authorities raise concerns about Trump plan to evict undocumented immigrants,https://thehill.com,[],06-18-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/regulation/other/449065-housing-authorities-raise-concerns-about-plans-to-evict-undocumented,"Landlords and local housing authorities are pushing back on a Trump administration plan to evict undocumented immigrants from subsidized housing, according to The New York Times.

The proposal from the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) would ban households with one or more undocumented member from living in such housing, but housing administrators and landlords say it would put the onus of immigration enforcement on them.

Under the proposal, released in April, they would have to evict up to 108,000 people receiving benefits, most of whom, they say, are some of their most reliable tenants when it comes to paying rent on time.

“The housing authority would bear the brunt of the expense of having to completely evict and go through the court action of having to evict these families,” Sylvia Blanco, the chief operating officer at the Housing Authority of the City of Austin, Texas, told the Times.

“We would be on the hook for having to pay for that,” she added.

The plan would also require public housing administrators to verify the immigration status of every resident every year, they told the Times, as well as issue eviction notices and potentially go through court battles with individual families, according to the Times.

In Austin, legal fees and staff expenses would cost about $1,000 per eviction, Blanco told the newspaper.

In Los Angeles, where at least 30 percent of public housing occupants are households that could be caught in the crosshairs of the policy, the enforcement cost would be nearly $10 million.

“You can imagine, if you’re forcing the eviction of nearly one-third of these very large public housing sites, the impact that has on households as well as the broader community,” Doug Guthrie, the president and chief executive of the Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles, told the Times.

Undocumented immigrants currently live with numerous families receiving housing subsidies, but the assistance is generally pro-rated according to how many members of the family are eligible, according to the Times.

“Most of our members are saying that’s a process that works,” Tim Kaiser, the executive director of the Public Housing Authorities Directors Association, told the newspaper.

HUD Secretary Ben Carson Benjamin (Ben) Solomon CarsonMoulton confirms he'll miss first Democratic debate Moulton confirms he'll miss first Democratic debate Lawmakers battle over HUD protections for homeless transgender people MORE also reportedly questioned the directive when the White House sent it, although he has since defended it at a congressional hearing, saying “this is common sense.

I-Team: U.S. Department of Education investigating Duke-UNC Consortium after complaints of anti-Semitism,https://abc11.com,['Jonah Kaplan'],06-18-2019,2019,6,https://abc11.com/i-team-us-dept-of-education-investigating-duke-unc-consortium/5350504/,"WASHINGTON, D.C. (WTVD) -- On Monday, U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos formally opened an investigation into the Duke-UNC Consortium for Middle East Studies which applied a federal grant to host a conference on Gaza tainted by accusations of anti-Semitism. In a letter obtained by the ABC11 I-Team , Secretary DeVos said she is ""troubled"" by the concerns raised by Rep. George Holding (R-North Carolina) who first requested an investigation earlier this spring ""In order for the department to learn more about this matter, I have directed the Office of Postsecondary Education to examine the use of funds under this program to determine if the Consortium violated the terms and conditions of its grant.""The Duke-UNC Consortium hosted the ""Conflict Over Gaza"" in March at UNC-Chapel Hill, and it was an event sponsored by more than two dozen university departments, plus the Rotary Club of Raleigh and other local organizations.A video taken by filmmaker Ami Horowitz captured an anti-Semitic song being performed by a Palestinian rapper - and met with applause.Many thought the conference would provide diverse perspectives on the conflict in the Middle East, but rapper Tamer Nafar tells the audience: ""Let's try it together. I need your help. I cannot be anti-Semitic alone."" That was before he sang a song with the lyrics: ""Don't think of Rihanna when you sing this, don't think of Beyonce - think of Mel Gibson. I'm in love with a Jew/Oh/I fell in love with a Jew/Oh/Her skin is white and my skin is brown, she was going up up and I was going down.""""I'd like to thank Secretary Devos for treating this matter with the seriousness and attention it deserves,"" Rep. Holding said in response to the new investigation. ""I hope we can all agree that it is irresponsible and immoral for taxpayer dollars to fund overtly biased advocacy under the guise of constructive academic discourse.""Many department heads and sponsors demanded their money back after the controversy erupted.In a scathing letter to leaders of the UNC Center for Middle East and Islamic Studies, which officially sponsored the event, UNC School of Law Dean Martin Brinkley said: ""Due to your inclusion of conference content over which I had no knowledge or control, I have been forced to spend most of the last two days responding to outraged members of my own community who are ashamed and embarrassed to see the law school shown as a sponsor of what they consider hate speech.""A statement released by UNC Interim Chancellor Kevin M. Guskiewicz called the performance ""disturbing"" and that he is ""heartbroken and deeply offended that this performance happened. I stand steadfast against Anti-Semitism and hate in all its forms.""UNC-Chapel Hill will continue to work with the U.S. Department of Education to directly answer any questions about the Duke-UNC Consortium for Middle East Studies, the university said."
EPA Union: Leaked email from MPCA suppressed EPA's PolyMet concerns,https://www.duluthnewstribune.com,['Jimmy Lovrien'],,,,https://www.duluthnewstribune.com/business/energy-and-mining/2719890-EPA-Union-Leaked-email-from-MPCA-suppressed-EPAs-PolyMet-concerns,"The union representing workers at the Environmental Protection Agency on Tuesday released an email which they say shows the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency tried to stifle concerns the EPA had on a permit for PolyMet’s proposed copper-nickel mine near Hoyt Lakes, set to be the first of its kind in Minnesota.

The American Federation of Government Employees Local 704, which represents the EPA’s Region 5 employees in Minnesota, sent news organizations a copy of an email sent by then-MPCA Assistant Commissioner Shannon Lotthammer to EPA Region Chief of Staff Kurt Thiede on May 13, 2018. In the email, Lotthammer asked Thiede and the EPA to wait on commenting on a PolyMet draft permit until the public comment period ended.

The union said it obtained the email through an anonymous leak.

“By asking EPA to submit its comments after the public comment period, in whatever form, MPCA was attempting to suppress those comments from public review,” Nicole Cantello, president of AFGE Local 70, said in a news release accompanying the leaked email. “This suppression is completely inappropriate and allowed those comments to remain secret.”

Cantello cited a section of the email where Lotthammer wrote, “We have asked that EPA Region 5 not send a written comment letter during the public comment period and instead follow the steps outlined in the (memorandum of agreement), and wait until we have reviewed and responded to public comments and made associated changes before sending comments from EPA.”

Lotthammer is now the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources’ assistant commissioner overseeing forestry, parks and trails and operations services.

Lotthammer declined to comment on the leaked email or the union’s response to it when reached via email by the News Tribune Tuesday afternoon. She directed inquiries to MPCA spokesperson Darin Broton.

In a statement, Broton said the MPCA made “substantive changes” to the permit based on numerous conversations between the MPCA and EPA and provided the memorandum of agreement between the MPCA and EPA that Lotthammer referenced in the email to the EPA.

“Today’s released email highlights the long-standing agreement between the EPA and MPCA that gives the state agency the authority to administer the federal permit program for water discharge,” Broton said.

In her email to the EPA, Lotthommer said the memorandum of agreement laid out steps for the EPA and MPCA to follow regarding comments made by both public and other agencies.

“The concern we have expressed to Region 5 staff/mgrs is the timing of EPA comments, not the ability for EPA to comment,” Lotthommer said. She reiterated later: “The question is about the timing of that review , and the importance of maintaining the approach laid out in the (memorandum of agreement) for the sake of clarity and efficiency, among other goals.”

The leaked email comes less than one week after the EPA released documents showing the agency was concerned a draft permit would not meet the Clean Water Act standards unless the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency made substantial changes to the permit and the EPA’s office of inspector general said it would audit the agency’s PolyMet permitting procedures.

EPA concerns over the permit have slowly come to light after Jeffry Fowley, a retired EPA attorney, said multiple people raised concerns with him that the EPA’s concerns and comments on PolyMet’s draft permit were told to the MPCA over the phone instead of in writing, leaving their concerns out of the public record.

“In all of my years of experience, I have never heard of a situation where EPA personnel have read written comments on a permit to state personnel over the phone,” Fowley wrote in a sworn declaration to Minnesota Court of Appeals. “There is no legitimate reason why written comments which could be sent would instead be read over the phone.”

For Paula Maccabee, counsel and advocacy director WaterLegacy, an environmental group opposed to the mine that has requested numerous EPA documents on PolyMet’s permit , the leaked email was confirmation of what Fowley had been saying for months.

“It was our hypothesis that the reason why the EPA political leaders suppressed what the career staff had to say was because Minnesota had put pressure on them. But we didn’t have proof, and now we do,” Maccabee said. “And that’s extremely troubling.”"
Justice Settles With More Broadcasters Over Spot Ad Info Exchanges,https://www.broadcastingcable.com,['John Eggerton'],06-17-2019,2019,6,https://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/justice-settles-with-more-broadcasters-over-spot-ad-info-exchanges,"The Justice Department has reached settlements with CBS, Cox, Scripps, Fox and Tegna in its ongoing investigation of the broadcast TV ad market and the exchange of competitively sensitive information.

That agreement settles a suit by Justice, which had alleged the broadcasters, and in the case of Cox its Cox Reps ad rep firms, illegally shared information that harmed the spot ad market.

Related: Delrahim Warns Against Ad Info Exchange

“The Antitrust Division’s efforts to protect competition in the television broadcast industry continue with today’s settlements that will stop the unlawful exchange of competitively sensitive information among rival broadcasters and their sales rep firms,” said Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim who heads up the antitrust division. “Vigorous competition among broadcast stations allows American businesses across the country to obtain competitive advertising rates. The unlawful sharing of information reduced that competition and thereby harmed businesses that rely on competitive rates to best serve their customers.”

Delrahim warned last fall that “agreements between competitors to exchange competitively sensitive information can violate the antitrust laws and lead to a civil enforcement action even if the conduct does not amount to the type of hard-core cartel conduct that the Antitrust Division prosecutes criminally.”

In essence the new settlement was an add-on to the one it had previously struck in U.S. v. Sinclair Et Al. (the et al. being Raycom, Tribune, Meredith, Griffin, Dreamcatcher, and Nexstar).

As with the previous settlement, there was no fine imposed.

Justice alleged that all of the broadcasters had agreed to exchange revenue pacing information, and also engaged in the exchange of other forms of non-public sales information in certain metropolitan areas. It alleged that the Cox Rep firms ""facilitated and participated in this exchange of pacing information by its broadcast-station clients that operated in the same metropolitan areas.""

Pacing compares the ads booked for a specific time period to the previous time period and ""indicates how each station is performing versus the rest of the market and provides insight into each station’s remaining spot advertising for the period,"" Justice said, helping the stations to know when their competitor might raise or lower spot ad prices.

""As a result, the information exchanges harmed the competitive price-setting process in markets for the sale of spot advertisements,"" Justice said Tuesday.

Justice commended all of the broadcasters for cooperating with the antitrust division to strike the settlement, with a special shout-out to Fox for its aid.

The settlement prevents the broadcasters from sharing that info, and Cox Reps has to erect firewalls in markets where it represents multiple stations. They must also adopt ""rigorous"" antitrust compliance and reporting regimes--whistleblower protection, compliance officers, newspaper announcements of settlement.

The terms of the settlement conditions are seven years and will apply to the stations even when and if they are sold to new owners, who must acknowledge that they inherit the terms of that settlement.

The investigation is not over, and the broadcasters have agreed to help with that ongoing review, suggesting more group broadcasters could be added to the list.

The investigation stemmed from Justice's review of the ultimately aborted Sinclair-Tribune deal.

DOJ's concerns about Sinclair's control of inventory in markets where it wanted to own two stations was one of the reasons Sinclair restructured its merger agreement, according to a source familiar with the DOJ review of that deal."
Buttigieg says Trump using Justice Department as 'his own personal law firm',https://www.foxnews.com,"[""Andrew O'Reilly""]",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/buttigieg-says-trump-using-justice-dept-his-own-personal-law-firm,"Pete Buttigieg, a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, on Sunday slammed President Trump’s recent move directing Attorney General William Barr to look into the origins of the Russia investigation and if U.S. officials improperly surveilled Trump's 2016 campaign.

Buttigieg, whose surprise move from the mayor of South Bend, Ind., to Democratic contender has been a major focus of the early campaign season, lambasted the president for using the Department of Justice as “his own personal law firm.”

“The independence of the DOJ is obviously not something this president respects,” Buttigieg said during an interview on NBC’s “Meet The Press.” “He’s treated it like it ought to be his own personal law firm.”

MAYOR PETE BUTTIGIEG CALLS OUT BIG TECH'S 'MONOPOLY POWER'

He added: “Prosecutorial decisions shouldn’t be made by politicians in that sense and what I will say is any attorney general that I would appoint is somebody who would faithfully apply the concept that no one is above the law that everybody ought to be held accountable.”

Last month, Trump directed the intelligence community to ""quickly and fully cooperate"" with Barr's probe. The directive marked an escalation in Trump's efforts to ""investigate the investigators,"" as he continues to try to undermine the findings of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's probe amid mounting Democratic calls for impeachment proceedings.

Barr has already asked John Durham, the U.S. attorney in Connecticut, to examine the origins of the Russia investigation to determine whether intelligence and surveillance methods used during the probe were lawful and appropriate. Still, Barr has been directly involved, according to a person familiar with the matter who was not authorized to discuss it publicly, and is also working with CIA Director Gina Haspel, Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and FBI Director Christopher Wray.

Despite Mueller finding no evidence to support criminal charges against Americans related to Russia's actions, his report documented extensive Russian efforts to interfere in the 2016 campaign and willingness on the part of some in Trump's orbit to accept their aid. Mueller left open a decision on whether or not Trump obstructed justice during the investigation.

Buttigieg told The Atlantic earlier in the week that a Justice Department in his administration might look at charging Trump with obstruction after his presidency.

“To the extent that there's an obstruction case, then, yes, DOJ's got to deal with it,"" he said.

Buttigieg cited President Gerald Ford's pardon of Richard Nixon following the Watergate scandal, but said he wouldn't be interested in pardoning Trump. ""I would want any credible allegation of criminal behavior to be investigated to the fullest,"" he said.

Cook County Homeland Security Command Van Moved Amid Complaints,https://patch.com,[],06-18-2019,2019,6,https://patch.com/illinois/evanston/cook-county-homeland-security-command-van-moved-amid-complaints,"EVANSTON, IL — A Cook County command van was moved away from a street festival Saturday in Evanston after the presence of the large Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Management vehicle at the Custer Street Fair prompted protests from residents.

The logo for the county emergency management agency, DHSEM, bears some similarity to that of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, commonly called ICE. Some residents complained that instead of increasing the sense of safety among fair attendees, the vehicle needlessly intimidated community members.

In social media posts, Evanston's police and fire departments announced they were working with the city's Office of Emergency Management and the Cook County homeland security department to provide security for the Custer Fair, including the command van and proactive barricades.

""This van is no way affiliated with ICE — Immigration and Customs Enforcement,"" police pointed out.

The mobile command center was subsequently replaced by a city-operated dump truck. Residents said it was relocated to a car dealership parking lot following complaints by neighbors.

Mayor Steve Hagerty responded with a message of support for the van.



""Public safety and being a welcoming city are not mutually exclusive. The City's priority is keeping people safe at the Custer Street Fair, not monitoring people for ICE,"" Hagerty responded on social media. ""I appreciate Cook County providing this Command Center.""



In October 2017, the mayor signed an updated ""Welcoming City Ordinance"" that protects people in the country illegally from being held by federal immigration authorities without a warrant signed by a federal judge. Hagerty has also operated an emergency management consulting company for the past 18 years.

""Should anything go wrong (e.g., weather, man made event, etc.), having a command center nearby is helpful for the emergency response. The Center can also be used proactively to monitor the weather at that specific location. The vehicle is not used in any way as part of immigration enforcement,"" Hagerty said, in an emailed response to concerned residents.

The mayor noted the command center had appeared in Evanston at previous occasions and said city officials would look to give the public the opportunity to check it out during a non-event in the future to see how it helps emergency responders.

""Nonetheless, we understand the size, location, and presence of this vehicle at Custer Street alarmed some people, particularly given the national focus on immigration,"" Hagerty said. ""To address these concerns, show more sensitivity towards our immigrant neighbors, and ensure strong economic activity for our vendors and businesses, in the future we will not use this type of vehicle as a barricade but instead, when we have it, place it nearby in a less public and prominent location.""



Over the past 18 months, the Unified Command Post, or UCP, has been used 41 times for events and festivals across 29 different municipalities in the past 18 months, according to information from county officials provided by Fire Chief Brian Scott. He said the post provides assistance monitoring weather and emergency medical services needs, as well as functioning as a unified emergency management center should something go seriously wrong.

""The mobile unified command center is an $830,000 asset with six on-board computer work stations and state of the art mobile communications suite that helps ensure interoperability. It also includes thermal imaging, a weather monitoring and incident management tools to assist fire and police officers,"" Scott said. Out of respect for some of the concerns raised by residents, he said, it was relocated Sunday to a block north of the fair.

""Given our most recent experience at the 2019 [Custer Street Fair], we will make sure to consider and be sensitive to the concerns raised by the immigrant community and their supporters,"" Scott said. ""Future steps could include pre-education opportunities for the entire Evanston community to see and visit the UCP to learn more about the vehicle as well as strategically placing the vehicle at future events in a less prominent location while still being able to utilize the UCP's full capability.""



(Evanston Fire Department)

Several residents commented in response that people left or did not attend the fair due to the presence of the Cook County vehicle, which could have been mistaken for one operated by federal immigration enforcement authorities.



""I am very disappointed the city decided to bring this command truck without thinking of the [trauma] it is putting our immigrant families through,"" one Evanston resident said. ""We have many resources in Evanston. Our city officials need to think of the decisions it makes if they expect our immigrant community to trust them.""

""My family won't be attending the fair because we feel unwelcome,"" said a Chicago resident. ""This is NOT normal and this is NOT ok. Don't try to normalize it with this lame post. This is totally tone deaf and damaging to the relationship the police force has with the community. Do better.""

Though dozens of commentators were critical of the presence of the vehicle, several people suggested those outraged by its presence were overreacting.



""Does anybody remember Nice France,"" 8th Ward Ald. Ann Rainey asked, a reference to a 2016 vehicular attack on a large outdoor Bastille Day celebration. She said the trailer had been misinterpreted. ""It was used at [Northwestern University's Dillo Day] without comment. Evanston is a wonderful caring City, and I know of no one who lives in fear here. I believe 99% of the population would back me up on that statement.""

""Stop being such a bunch of cry babies and get on with your lives and grow up,"" said a retired Evanston police officer. ""The van not going to hurt you, it's there for your protection. If you don't want to attend, then don't.""

President Donald Trump announced Monday night in a social media post that ICE would ""begin the process of removing the millions of illegal aliens who have illicitly found their way into the United States. They will be removed as fast as they come in.""

State Department says senior UN official’s visit to China 'highly inappropriate',https://www.foxnews.com,['Ben Evansky'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/state-department-says-senior-un-officials-visit-to-china-highly-inappropriate,"The State Department criticized an upcoming visit of the UN’s counter-terrorism Czar to China as, “highly inappropriate,” after it was revealed the official was going to a province that has witnessed persecution of ethnic Muslims for their religious beliefs by the Chinese government.

The U.N. has faced ongoing criticism of cozying up to China – adding fuel to the fire the U.N. has allowed Vladimir Voronkov, the United Nations Under-Secretary for the UN’s counter-terrorism office to visit Xinjiang, which is home to some one million persecuted Uighur and ethnic Muslims.

State Department spokesperson Morgan Ortagus said that Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan called UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, Friday, “to convey deep concerns,” regarding Vornonkov’s planned visit to Xinjiang, China.

“The Deputy Secretary expressed that such a visit is highly inappropriate in view of the unprecedented repression campaign underway in Xinjiang against Uighurs, ethnic Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, and other Muslims.”

US SPEAKS UP FOR MINORITY MUSLIM UIGHURS IN CHINA - WHILE ISLAMIC COUNTRIES STAY MOSTLY SILENT

Ortagus continued, “The Deputy Secretary noted that Beijing continues to paint its repressive campaign against Uighurs and other Muslims as legitimate counterterrorism efforts when it is not, and stressed that the UN’s topmost counterterrorism official is putting at risk the UN’s reputation and credibility on counterterrorism and human rights by lending credence to these false claims.”

Proposing a solution, “The Deputy Secretary advocated for unmonitored and unhindered access to all camps and detainees in Xinjiang by UN human rights officials.”

China has faced growing scrutiny over its internment camps that hold approximately 1 million Muslims in the Xinjiang region of Western China.

A recent State Department country report on human rights practices in China noted: “Members of the minority Uighur ethnic group reported systematic torture and other degrading treatment…survivors stated that authorities subjected individuals in custody to electrocution, waterboarding, stress positions, injection of unknown substances and cold cells.”

In April, Antonio Guterres the UN Secretary-General faced criticism for not raising the issue of the Uighurs directly with President Xi Jinping on a visit there. Instead, his spokesman told reporters that he had discussed the situation in Xinjiang with, “Chinese authorities.”

KEANU REEVES' PICTURE AMONG TOOLS IN CHINA'S CRACKDOWN ON UIGHUR MINORITY

China’s new ambassador to the UN in Geneva confirmed to reporters this week that China had invited Michelle Bachelet, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights to visit the camps in the region. Her spokesperson told the Associated Press that her office is in negotiations for “full access,” for the trip to take place.

Last month during a session of the UN Human Rights Council in Switzerland, the Executive Director of UN Watch, Hillel Neuer, took to the floor against the continuous objections of China and described the conditions ethnic Muslims were living under.

“Surveillance and repression in Xinjiang has increased dramatically,” he said. “Biometric data is collected from residents, passports confiscated, religious activity restricted. China bans long beards, public prayers and Muslim veils.”

Despite its human rights violations, China is a member of the U.N. Human Rights Council.

In what particular way it does that may be decided by our ability to keep data secure and out of the hands of cyberattackers.

There have been some recent stumbles on the part of government agencies. Earlier this year, the Homeland Security Department announced that FEMA had released the personal information of 2.3 million hurricane and wildfire survivors to a contractor. That information, in the wrong hands, could certainly be used for large-scale identity fraud.

This week, Customs and Border Protection issued a statement explaining that biometric information — photos of faces and license plates — had been exposed in a cyber attack. The information was sitting on a contractor’s server at the time.

A Customs spokesman indicated that the images involved fewer than 100,000 people, according to The Associated Press, but that number is not small and lives could be terribly affected.

Kade Crockford, director of the Technology for Liberty Program at the ACLU of Massachusetts, said the breach underscores the need for both federal and state moratoriums on government use of the technology.

“Once your face is leaked in a data breach like this, it can be weaponized against you for the rest of your life,” Crockford said. “If the attackers can mock up a fake image of you based on these leaked data, they can impersonate you and potentially break into your private accounts. If your password is hacked in a data breach, you can change it. But you can’t change your face.”

Sen. Ed Markey has called on DHS to halt the expansion of its biometric program until there were safeguards in place. Likewise, so has Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah).

Until the Department of Homeland Security can adequately prove that they can secure the personal information of Americans, the expansion of the biometric program should be halted."

DOJ asks Worcester judge to dismiss suit by asylum seekers in Westboro,https://www.telegram.com,"['Brad Petrishen', 'Brad Petrishen Telegram', 'Gazette Staff']",06-17-2019,2019,6,https://www.telegram.com/news/20190617/doj-asks-worcester-judge-to-dismiss-suit-by-asylum-seekers-in-westboro,"WORCESTER — Lawyers for the Department of Justice Monday asked a federal judge in Worcester to dismiss a lawsuit filed here on behalf of asylum seekers nationwide who were separated at the border last year.

“There’s simply not jurisdiction (here),” Mary H. Mason, one of three Washington, D.C., lawyers who traveled to Worcester for the hearing, told Judge Timothy S. Hillman, arguing the case was improperly filed in Massachusetts and would not pass legal muster anyhow.

Lawyers for the plaintiffs — two migrant families living in Westboro who seek the right to sue on behalf of separated families nationwide — disagreed, arguing that officials acted outside the bounds of the law and should be held personally responsible.

“This case is remarkable, because what the defendants did here is remarkable,” Howard M. Cooper said, raising his voice as he described actions by border patrol agents that in his mind constitute “psychological torture.”

Mr. Cooper is one of nine attorneys from six firms representing two Guatemalan families living in Westboro who were separated after illegally crossing the southern border. The families aspire to secure damages and a mental health fund for themselves and thousands of others similarly separated at the border.

At the heart of the case at this stage is whether the federal court in Worcester has “personal jurisdiction” over the government officials being sued, which include former Attorney General Jeff Sessions and former Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen.

Ms. Mason said the lawsuit should have been filed in Washington, D.C., where the policymakers worked, arguing none of them have sufficient enough ties to Massachusetts to allow them to be tried here.

Additionally, she and colleagues argued the plaintiffs’ attempt to sue government officials personally will not withstand prior rulings, including a Supreme Court ruling, that she said properly protect policymakers and prosecutors.

“They are attacking a government policy,” DOJ lawyer Thomas G. Ward told Judge Hillman, adding that the judge would be “(alone) at sea” to allow them to use one of their primary arguments.

The plaintiffs are seeking what is called a “Bivens remedy,"" a remedy carved out in a 1971 Supreme Court case that allows people to sue for unconstitutional conduct carried out by individual federal officers.

The Supreme Court has since restricted the situations in which such a remedy could be applied, reasoning that Congress — not the judiciary — should enact laws that establish a framework for suing federal agents personally.

Government lawyers Monday said that Congress has not done so, and argued this case is not similar enough to the prior “Bivens” cases to make such relief legally possible.

Mr. Cooper rebutted that Congress accomplishes little, especially when it comes to border reform, and argued that at least three of the lawsuit’s nine counts would be covered under Bivens.

“If there is no Bivens remedy, there will be no remedy,” Mr. Cooper said, averring that the government is trying to improperly protect policymakers who acted unconstitutionally.

“This (lawsuit) is about deterring discrimination,” Mr. Cooper said. “It’s about deterring outrageous violations of the Fourth and Fifth amendments.”

Mr. Cooper criticized the government’s framing of the lawsuit as an improper attack on the administration’s “zero tolerance” policy on illegal immigration.

The policy, publicly announced in April 2018, involves prosecuting everyone who enters the country illegally.

Whereas government lawyers argue the lawsuit is an attack on the policy, Mr. Cooper argues the policy itself was announced to justify an unconstitutional practice of separating families caught illegally crossing the border.

In court documents, Mr. Cooper’s team noted that Ms. Nielsen in June 2018 denied having a policy of separating families, and that President Donald J. Trump “echoed” that statement.

“The government has argued a motion to dismiss on a completely false premise denied by their own clients,” he argued Monday, adding the issue here is “the discriminatory animus that was top down ... against immigrants (from Latino countries) properly seeking political asylum.”

Mr. Ward, one of the DOJ lawyers, countered that the policy “applied to everybody who came in on the southern border.” He added that while Mr. Cooper may have offered a good “opening argument,” the law is on the government’s side.

Mr. Ward argued Mr. Sessions and other DOJ brass are entitled to “qualified immunity” from personal liability because there is no clearly established right of people illegally crossing the border to not be separated from their families.

Mr. Ward said there are debates among courts on when a minor is considered “unaccompanied” — a term that becomes important when evaluating whether family separation is constitutionally permissible.

Judge Hillman, speaking to one of the plaintiff’s lawyers, remarked, “I am a little hung up on whether this right is clearly established, because it sure doesn’t feel like it is.”

The lawyer, Joseph M. Cacace, noted that issues of qualified immunity are generally decided later in a case. And he noted that, in a similar case in California, a judge ruled it likely parents would prevail on a charge that the continued separation of migrant families violated the Fifth Amendment.

“There is no compelling interest in traumatizing children,” Mr. Cacace said, arguing that Mr. Sessions and others can and should be liable for emotional distress caused by the border separations.

Mr. Cooper dismissed an argument from the government’s lawyers that the lawsuit would run afoul of laws established to protect policymakers and prosecutors.

“The government was not supposed to do what it did,” he said, arguing that the separations violated a 1997 agreement that set standards for the government’s care of children within the immigration detention system.

Judge Hillman took the arguments under advisement. He did not request arguments about a separate motion before him in which the plaintiffs seek to also add the U.S. government as a defendant.

Mr. Cacace said after the hearing that the government was not initially named as a defendant because of a six-month statutory waiting period that expired in April.

Mr. Cacace said the lawyers representing the Westboro families would continue to press the case if it is moved to the nation's capital.

While his clients have not been identified in court papers, the initials and stories of one of the families is identical to those of a family who spoke to the Telegram & Gazette at a rally in Westboro in 2018.

Elmer Oliva told the T&G that, after fleeing violence in Guatemala, his wife and kids were separated for five weeks, during which time, he alleged, his kids were mistreated in a detention center.

"DOJ, major banks meet to address elder financial abuse",https://www.foxbusiness.com,['Megan Henney'],,,,https://www.foxbusiness.com/features/doj-major-banks-meet-to-address-elder-financial-abuse,"article

Attorney General William Barr met with the general counsel of several major banks on Friday to address elder financial exploitation – a type of abuse in which older Americans lose money to fraud.

Continue Reading Below

The meeting centered around what financial institutions can do to slow the growing problem; according to a Department of Justice news release, the banks agreed to “better collaborate” to apply successful programs and protocols to identify and prevent international criminals from targeting American seniors.

“The financial industry and the Department agreed to continue communication and increase collaboration efforts in order to fight this critically important issue ensnaring the most vulnerable in our society,” the DOJ said.

It’s unclear which banks were involved in the meeting. The DOJ did not immediately respond to a FOX Business request for comment.

Stopping elder fraud has become a top priority for the DOJ; only one in 44 cases is reported. When the elderly lose money, it’s likely to be a more significant loss than a younger person. On average, the median loss for someone over the age of 80 is $1,700. The median age for someone between the ages of 20 to 29 is $400.

Barr also announced the establishment of a new joint law enforcement effort -- the Transnational Elder Fraud Strike Force -- that combines the DOJ’s Consumer Protection branch, the U.S. Attorneys’ Offices for six federal offices, the FBI and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service.

“Fraud against the elderly is on the rise,” Barr said. “One of the most significant and pernicious causes for this increase is foreign-based fraud schemes.”

The news comes on the heels of a report, conducted and published by the Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, that found nursing homes failed to report about one in five potential cases of abuse of elders on Medicare to the appropriate state inspection agencies.

Federal investigators determined that health workers at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, known as CMS, routinely don't report possible incidents of abuse or neglect to local law enforcement and other agencies to be tracked and recorded, in accordance with federal requirements.

However, a CMS spokesperson told FOX Business that the federal agency -- a part of the Department of Health and Human Services -- requires nursing homes to report allegations of abuse, neglect and mistreatment ""promptly"" to state survey agencies and other authorities."

Secretary of State Pompeo Wants to 'Unite' the World Over Alleged Iran Attacks,https://time.com,['Ellen Knickmeyer'],,,,https://time.com/5608030/mike-pompeo-iran-attacks/,"(WASHINGTON) — Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is reaching out to wary foreign leaders to frame alleged Iranian attacks in a Middle East oil shipping route as a problem for the world at large, especially for Asian countries vitally dependent on that oil.

Pompeo, in a series of Sunday television interviews, emphasized the U.S. international outreach in the wake of what the U.S. says were Iranian attacks Thursday on two oil tankers near the Strait of Hormuz.

“I made a bunch of phone calls yesterday. I’ll make a whole bunch more calls today. The world needs to unite,” Pompeo said. He did not say what kind of action the Trump administration envisioned.

“We are going to work to build out a set of countries that have deep vested interest in keeping that strait open to help us do that,” Pompeo said.

That echoed comments from acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan this past week when he said the U.S. goal is to “build international consensus to this international problem.”

Iran has denied being involved in the attacks and accused America of promoting an “Iranophobic” campaign against it.

Pressed on whether any new U.S. military deployment to the region was possible, Pompeo said that “of course” remained among the options that President Donald Trump may consider to keep shipping safe through the narrow strait, a strategic choke point for oil shipments from the Middle East.

Trump last year withdrew the U.S. from an international agreement, signed in 2015 by President Barack Obama, to limit Iran’s nuclear program. Trump has reinstated economic sanctions and recently ended waivers that allowed some countries to continue buying Iranian oil. That has deprived Iran of oil income and has coincided with what U.S. officials said was a surge in intelligence pointing to Iranian preparations for attacks against U.S. forces and interests in the Gulf region.

The U.S. has accelerated the deployment of the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier battle group to the region, sent four nuclear-capable B-52 bombers to Qatar and bolstered its defenses in the region by deploying more Patriot air defense systems.

Some European allies have called for a careful investigation of responsibility, worried that Trump was escalating tensions with a country he has long called a top U.S. enemy.

Pompeo stressed that the U.S. gets relatively little of its energy supplies through the strait, which lies between the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman. The U.S. Energy Information Administration says 16 percent of U.S. petroleum imports came from the Persian Gulf countries in 2018.

By contrast, about 80% of oil through the shipping passage supplies energy-hungry countries in Asia, including China, Japan, India and South Korea. Those countries have skin in the game, he said.

“I’m confident that when they see the risk — the risk of their own economies and their own people and outrageous behavior of the Islamic Republic of Iran, they will join us in this,” Pompeo said.

Pompeo said intelligence officials had “lots of data, lots of evidence” that Iran was responsible. Pressed for specifics, Pompeo pointed to grainy black-and-white footage already released by the U.S.

American officials say the footage shows Iranian Revolutionary Guard troops removing an unexploded mine from a Japanese tanker. The tanker’s crew gave an apparently different account, saying “flying objects” targeted the vessel.

Pompeo said the administration had shared the video and other unspecified evidence with Germany and other nations.

Asked if the U.S. had a credibility problem with allies worried Trump could be seeking a pretext to move against Iran, the secretary of state said, “We’re not selling anything. These- these are simple facts.”

Pompeo spoke on “Fox News Sunday” and CBS’s “Face the Nation.”

"For U.S. presidents, poker is a main event",https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Norman Chad', 'Norman Chad Writes A Syndicated Sports Humor Column.']",06-16-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/for-us-presidents-poker-is-a-main-event/2019/06/16/7a1a5e54-8fb1-11e9-b08e-cfd89bd36d4e_story.html,"Columnist

We are in the midst of the World Series of Poker in Las Vegas, with the world championship $10,000 buy-in Main Event beginning July 3, and in its 50th year this annual festival dwarfs the World Series of Baseball in one very unmistakable manner:

The World Series of Poker is a true world series.

Baseball’s alleged World Series is the championship of the United States and Toronto. The WSOP Main Event is the championship of the world — last year, 83 nations were represented, with 2,116 of the 7,874 entrants from outside the U.S.

Frankly, I would argue — and I am arguing — that in addition to having a great international presence, poker is more of an American game than baseball.

You need look no further than the White House.

Many, many presidents played poker as adults before, during and after their administrations. Of course, no presidents have played adult baseball — though George W. Bush was part-owner of the Texas Rangers for a while — and the only MLB presidential activity is the occasional “throwing out the first pitch” at a game after sometimes getting booed.

Let’s kick-start this column by listing four presidential poker facts — well, three facts and one falsehood. You have to pick the imposter!

(a) Richard Nixon loved playing in the Navy, winning enough to help finance his first congressional campaign.

(b) Rutherford B. Hayes built a “man cave” of sorts on the South Lawn, where he played a Friday night game when Congress was in session.

(c) Dwight Eisenhower loved playing in the Army, winning enough to pay for an engagement ring for Mamie.

(d) Warren Harding liked playing twice a week in office and reputedly once lost an entire set of White House china on a poker bet.

The falsehood? It is (b) — Hayes didn’t even own a deck of cards; well, his wife did.

(Usual disclosure: I have been the “color commentator” for ESPN’s World Series of Poker telecasts since 2003 despite knowing very little about poker or broadcasting, joined by my partner Lon McEachern, who also knows very little about cards or TV. We are proof you can fail upward in America, or get elected.)

Among the other presidents who played poker were Ulysses S. Grant, Abraham Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harry Truman and Barack Obama.

Harding’s advisers played so often with the boss, they were known as the “Poker Cabinet.”

FDR played a regular nickel-ante game in the White House study. His favorite stud games were one-eyed jacks wild and “Woolworth’s,” in which fives and tens were wild.

(Note to readers — or to my reader — under the age of 30: Woolworth’s was a “five-and-dime” department store in the 20th century.)

Truman’s motto, “The buck stops here,” was actually a poker expression; in the 19th century, hunting knives with buckhorn handles were used as the dealer button.

On March 4, 1946, Truman and Winston Churchill played poker on the presidential train en route to Fulton, Mo. Churchill had five Scotches before the game even began, lost $250 and gave up at 2:30 a.m. — he needed to sober up for his famous Iron Curtain speech the next day and needed to sober up for the Cold War.

Which reminds me — in 1271, Kublai Khan’s chief of staff check-raised the emperor at a home game, and the poor sap was working port authority at the Black Sea within a week.*

(*This is probably a falsehood.)

Our current POTUS, Donald Trump, does not play poker. But he created the U.S. Poker Championship for his Trump Taj Mahal casino in 1998, another one of his myriad business failures, held annually until 2010.

As part of ESPN’s coverage of the event in 2006, Trump offered “Trump’s Power Tips” coming out of commercial breaks.

Here was one of them:

“When somebody challenges you, fight back. Don’t let them push you around. Don’t be a sucker. Fight back 10 times harder than they ever thought. Guess what? They’ll never play games with you again.”

I guess he wasn’t bluffing.
