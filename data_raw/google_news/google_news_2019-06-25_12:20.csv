Opinion | The Travel Ban Shows What Happens When the Supreme Court Trusts Trump,https://www.nytimes.com,"['Neal K. Katyal', 'Joshua A. Geltzer']",06-25-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/25/opinion/supreme-court-travel-ban-trump.html,"Second, the opinion emphasized a year ago that, even with the ban in place, there was a requirement for periodic review of the countries subject to it. The majority’s opinion stressed that the presidential proclamation carrying out the ban requires the Department of Homeland Security to assess on a continuing basis whether entry restrictions against particular countries should be altered — and to provide a report to the president every 180 days. Indeed, the majority justices seemed quite taken by the convenient fact that, just 15 days before the case was argued at the Supreme Court, the White House had removed Chad from the list of countries subject to the ban as a result of the 180-day review.

Well, it’s been 14 months since Chad was removed from a ban to which it never should’ve been subject in the first place, and no other country has shared its good fortune. Indeed, not only has no country come off the list since the court upheld the ban, but there’s been no public indication we have found that the required 180-day review is even occurring. If it is, it’s happening entirely in secret — and yielding no alterations. The regular reviews emphasized a year ago by the court’s majority now look even more like something more fictional than a robust evaluation process.

Third, the court’s decision noted that, even while the ban remained in place and even for countries still subject to it, “case-by-case waivers” were available for individuals to allow them to travel to the United States if they could show “undue hardship.” The chief justice’s majority opinion emphasized that the availability of waivers made Mr. Trump’s travel ban more similar to actions of earlier presidents. It also underscored the direction given to consular officers to assess waiver applications while addressing any public safety concerns and broader implications for the national interest.

The waiver program looked like a sham a year ago, as a consular officer made clear in a sworn affidavit in another matter and as Justice Stephen Breyer emphasized in his powerful dissent. It looks like even more of a sham now. According to the Trump administration’s own data, between December 2017 and May 2018 approximately 98 percent of those who applied for a visa to travel to the United States did not receive a waiver. More recent reporting still shows only 6 percent of those subject to the travel ban receiving waivers. What’s more, the process even for seeking a waiver has remained opaque to the point of being inscrutable. So have the criteria by which consular officers evaluate the waiver applications they do receive. The waiver process held up by the court’s majority a year ago continues to let down applicants today.

Reasonable people can differ about whether these three points were obvious to the court a year ago, and the court’s defenders are right to suggest that it doesn’t usually second-guess presidential determinations or try to foresee the future. But the point isn’t just that the court’s decision a year ago has aged poorly — it’s that key foundations for that decision have crumbled. The court’s majority embraced Mr. Trump’s representations that his travel ban was temporary, subject to regular reassessment and softened by the availability of waivers. Those premises looked arguably faulty then but are now downright far-fetched."
Trump tiring of Mulvaney,https://www.politico.com,['Nancy Cook'],06-25-2019,2019,6,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/25/trump-mick-mulvaney-white-house-1379594,"Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney has been increasingly the subject of President Donald Trump's irritation, revealing a slow deterioration of their relationship. | Win McNamee/Getty Images White House Trump tiring of Mulvaney But the president is unlikely to replace his acting chief of staff for the foreseeable future, because finding a fourth chief of staff would be a heavy lift.

President Donald Trump’s honeymoon period with Mick Mulvaney is coming to an end.

In recent weeks, Trump has been snapping at his acting chief of staff with some frequency, and expressing greater frustration with him than usual, according to four current and former senior administration officials.

Story Continued Below

Trump has long said that he prefers the flexibility offered by temporary titles, but Mulvaney’s ongoing “acting” status underscores the uphill battle he faces as Trump’s third chief of staff in less than two-and-a-half years. While Mulvaney is not in danger of losing his job any time soon, officials stressed, Trump’s treatment of him still signals to aides the slow deterioration of their relationship has begun.

One White House official called it “inevitable since any chief of staff has to deliver both the good and bad news,” and this president does not like hearing the latter. Other senior administration officials said Trump gets annoyed with almost everyone apart from family members, so measuring someone’s internal standing by how often Trump speaks sharply to him or her is futile.

But speculation about Mulvaney’s standing with Trump jumped into the public eye earlier this month when the president called out his acting chief of staff for coughing during an interview with ABC News. Even though some saw the incident as reflective of Trump’s general disdain for germs, others viewed it as Trump’s private vexation spilling over.

“The president doesn’t have any good reason to dislike Mulvaney in terms of him being disloyal,” said one Republican close to the White House. Still, the Republican added that the president has asked people in recent months what kind of leadership they think Mulvaney is offering in the West Wing and the value he is adding, often a sign the president is souring on a staffer.

More broadly, several staffers have begun to murmur about Mulvaney’s approach to the job, arguing he’s grown too accustomed to the trappings of White House power. Mulvaney and his top aides have stacked the West Wing so far with 11 loyal staffers from the Office of Management and Budget, where he previously worked. Additionally, he has used Camp David — typically a respite for presidents, not staffers — to host three different retreats with White House senior staff, top health care officials and congressional lawmakers. This, combined with his tendency to load up Air Force One trips with favored administration aides, has made him a target of criticism among some West Wing staff.

Mulvaney’s public criticism of his predecessors like John Kelly has also grated on some staffers. Kelly was not popular among West Wing aides by the end, but staffers still consider Mulvaney’s recent barbs unnecessary.

White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders did not respond to calls and an email request for comment. Mulvaney, through a top aide, also did not respond to a request for comment.

Despite the frustrations with Mulvaney, Trump is unlikely to replace him for the foreseeable future, several aides said. Ultimately, the president likes the hands-off approach Mulvaney has taken to his schedule, whims and decision-making style. More importantly, Trump is wary to embark on another chief of staff search after the last one played out in the press over several days with two top candidates turning down offers and a raft of negative headlines.

And the conflict-averse president would never tell Mulvaney to his face that he is annoyed, aides said. Instead, Trump shows his frustration by polling staffers and friends about the person, or by making little digs at them. Trump does this either to signal his waning affection, or to assert his dominance over an ally or staffer who Trump feels has gotten too big for his britches, according to two former senior administration officials.

Some staffers thought the verbal reprimand Trump delivered to Mulvaney for coughing was an example of this type of behavior.

Labeled “Coughgate” by some in the Trump orbit, the TV clip showed the president asking his acting chief of staff to leave the room if he needed to cough again. “You just can’t, you just can’t cough,” Trump said toward Mulvaney as he shook his head.

Some Trump allies felt the tone represented the public airing of Trump’s newfound irritation with his acting chief, while others saw it as common practice for the president and germaphobe who does not like shaking hands or being around sick staffers. He doesn’t even like it if people sneeze around him, said one White House aide.

Adding to the percolating Mulvaney backlash are his mixed reviews in steering the White House on policy matters.

Although Mulvaney has long cultivated a reputation as a policy wonk in Washington, Senate Republicans have not enjoyed negotiating directly with him to try and reach a deal on a looming budget showdown. With deadlines rapidly approaching this fall, the two sides have yet to make significant progress toward an agreement to raise the debt ceiling and lift stiff spending caps.

And Mulvaney’s guidance to Trump during the federal government shutdown in late December and January to win border wall funding was widely seen as politically harmful to the White House and Republicans — as was Mulvaney’s eventual move to declare a national emergency to try and bypass Congress for wall funds.

Republicans similarly did not like it when Trump pivoted back to trying to repeal Obamacare this spring after the Republicans’ ill-fated efforts during repeal and replace the law during the president’s first year in office. GOP lawmakers, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, were irked that Mulvaney had allowed Trump to steer into an issue they felt had damaged the party ahead of the 2018 midterms.

Being Trump’s chief of staff has always been viewed as a semi-thankless job, no matter how one approaches it. Trump demands loyalty from everyone around him but never really returns it, staffers say, and he’s churned through three chiefs of staff in under three years — along with a long list of other top officials like national security adviser, communications director and deputy chief of staff."
"Murdoch lieutenant ordered removal of New York Post story on Trump sexual assault allegation, sources say",https://www.cnn.com,"['Oliver Darcy', 'Marianne Garvey', 'Cnn Business']",06-24-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/24/media/new-york-post-col-allan-trump/index.html,"New York (CNN) The New York Post's former top editor, a supporter of President Trump and an old lieutenant of Rupert Murdoch who returned to the conservative tabloid as an adviser in early 2019, ordered the removal of a story about writer Jean Carroll's sexual assault allegations against President Trump, two people familiar with the matter told CNN Business.

The Post's story about Carroll's sexual assault allegations was mysteriously scrubbed from the tabloid's website on Friday afternoon. The link to the story, which had been written by reporter Joe Tacopino, directed readers to a dead or 404 page.

A wire story by the Associated Press which had been published on the Post's website was also removed.

Carroll accused Trump of sexually assaulting her in an excerpt of her forthcoming book published by New York magazine on Friday. She said Trump penetrated her against her will in the fitting room of Bergdorf Goodman in the 1990s after asking her to try on a piece of lingerie. Trump denied the claim in a Friday statement.

A spokeswoman for the Post declined to comment. The spokeswoman did not dispute the account of events CNN Business provided to her, nor did she provide an explanation for the removal of the stories about Carroll's accusations.

CNN's Fareed Zakaria: 'Thousands' could die because of Trump's sanctions on Iran,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Joseph Wulfsohn', 'Joseph A. Wulfsohn Is A Media Reporter For Fox News. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/cnns-fareed-zakaria-thousands-could-die-because-of-trumps-sanctions-on-iran,"CNN host Fareed Zakaria warned President Trump on Monday night that ""thousands"" could potentially die due to the new sanctions his administration has placed on Iran.

Following the president's last-minute decision last week to call off a military strike that he claimed would have killed about 150 people, the White House announced that Iran will face additional ""hard-hitting"" sanctions that will specifically target Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and his associates.

TRUMP SIGNS EXECUTIVE ORDER DELIVERING 'HARD-HITTING' SANCTIONS AGAINST IRAN

Appearing on ""CNN Tonight,"" Zakaria struggled to answer whether President Trump did the right thing by calling off the strike because of the apparent dangers of the sanctions.

""The sanctions that are in place in Iran probably- I haven't done the calculations, but I think it's fair to say almost certainly will kill several hundred, maybe thousands of people over the next few months in terms of depriving people of medical supplies, food, nutrition,"" Zakaria said. ""And when you do a military strike, the people you are killing will tend to be Iranian soldiers, military officers who are volunteering to take park in Iran's military struggle. The people you kill when you impose sanctions are the most vulnerable in society. These are the poorest people, the sickest people.""

He continued, ""So if that's his concern, he seems almost gleeful about the idea of imposing more and more sanctions on Iran. Has he thought about the human cost of this? I don't think so.""

The CNN host went on to blast the ""weird, impulse-driven policy"" on Iran and questioned whether there were ""any grownups in the White House"" for naming the wrong ayatollah in their announcement of the new sanctions."
FedEx sues the Department of Commerce after incident involving misrouted Huawei packages – TechCrunch,https://techcrunch.com,[],06-24-2019,2019,6,https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/24/fedex-sues-the-department-of-commerce-after-incident-involving-misrouted-huawei-packages/,"FedEx is suing the United States Department of Commerce, claiming that it has been “essentially deputize[d]” to enforce its trade blacklist. The lawsuit comes a month after Huawei said it is reassessing its relationship with the delivery giant after several packages meant for shipment within Asia were instead diverted, or erroneously marked for delivery, to the U.S. FedEx claimed the packages (which Huawei said did not contain any technology covered by the trade ban imposed against it by the Trump administration) had been misrouted by accident.

In a statement today about the lawsuit, FedEx said that the current export ban “places an unreasonable burden on FedEx to police the millions of shipments that transit our network every day.” Filed on Monday, the lawsuit asks the U.S. District Court in the District of Columbia to stop the Department of Commerce from enforcing prohibitions in the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) against FedEx.

FedEx said in its court filing that it has “developed a sophisticated proprietary risk-based compliance system” to adhere to U.S. export laws by screening for senders or recipients on the list of entities believed to pose a national security risk. Huawei, which was not mentioned by name in either FedEx’s announcement or its complaint against the U.S. government, was added to that list last month. But FedEx says the U.S. government expects it to perform a “virtually impossible task, logistically, economically, and in many cases, legally” since it handles million of packages each day and most of them are sealed by customers before being given to the company. Therefore, the company argues that EAR violates its rights to due process under the Fifth Amendment.

China is an important growth market for FedEx, but earlier this month its future there was put in jeopardy when the Chinese government said it was under investigation for violating laws and regulations after the incident involving Huawei’s packages. Last year the company was forced to cut its 2019 earnings guidance. FedEx’s chairman and CEO Frederick Smith blamed “bad political choices” around the world, including Brexit, state-owned enterprises and China and U.S. tariffs, for hurting its business."
Treasury Department Launches Investigation Into Delays Behind Harriet Tubman $20 Bill,https://www.npr.org,['Vanessa Romo'],06-24-2019,2019,6,https://www.npr.org/2019/06/24/735525569/treasury-department-launches-investigation-into-delays-behind-harriet-tubman-20-,"Treasury Department Launches Investigation Into Delays Behind Harriet Tubman $20 Bill

Enlarge this image toggle caption Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images

The Treasury Department will conduct an investigation into the circumstances leading to a delay in the production of a new $20 bill featuring a portrait of slave-turned-slave-emancipator Harriet Tubman.

In a letter to Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., released Monday, acting Inspector General Rich Delmar explained the inquiry will be folded into a larger examination of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing's project management processes for new note design that was already in the works.

""As part of this work, we will interview the stakeholders involved in the new note design process,"" Delmar wrote.

In 2016, the Treasury Department announced it would replace President Andrew Jackson's face with that of the famed abolitionist by 2020. As NPR reported, the update would have made Tubman the first woman since Martha Washington to appear on an American currency note and the first ever African American. But last month, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin announced the redesign will be delayed until 2028.

Schumer called on the department to launch an investigation last week, specifically asking for a review of ""the involvement of other participants in the interagency process related to the redesign – including the Secret Service, Federal Reserve, and the White House – to ensure that political considerations have not been allowed to infect the process for designing American currency.""

Delmar noted the review will seek interviews with officials, including senior executives from Treasury, BEP, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board), United States Secret Service and the Board's Currency Technology Office.

He added it will take approximately 10 months.

""If, in the course of our audit work, we discover indications of the employee misconduct or other matters that warrant a referral to our Office of Investigations, we will do so expeditiously,"" Delmar said.

Before he was elected, President Trump was critical of a redesign that would eliminate Jackson's image, saying the move was motivated by ""pure political correctness.""

Jackson ""represented somebody that really was very important to this country,"" Trump said in a Today show interview. He suggested it would be ""more appropriate"" to put Tubman's image on a note of different denomination."
Acting Defense Secretary Mark Esper sends first memo to troops as Pentagon boss,https://www.foxnews.com,['Talia Kaplan'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/acting-defense-secretary-mark-esper-memo-troops-pentagon,"On his first day on the job as the new acting secretary of defense, Mark Esper on Monday sent a memorandum to all Pentagon employees, laying out the Defense Department’s “path forward.”

In the memo, titled “Initial Message to the Department,” Esper wrote, “As we continue to advance the Nation’s security, let me reaffirm our path forward. The National Defense Strategy remains our guiding document and everything we do should support its stated objectives.”

Esper was named the new acting secretary of defense by President Trump last Tuesday after Patrick Shanahan withdrew his nomination.

WHO IS MARK ESPER, TRUMP'S NEW ACTING SECRETARY OF DEFENSE PICK?

Esper, 56, has served as the 23rd secretary of the United States Army since Nov. 17, 2017. His duties included the recruitment, organization, training, equipping and care of 1.4 million active duty, National Guard, Reserve Soldiers, Department of the Army Civilians and their families, according to his Pentagon biography.

Esper said Monday the department’s priorities would “remain unchanged” and everything the department did “should support its stated objectives.”

He then went on to explain “three mutually reinforcing lines of effort” used to continue to expand the competitive space. They included building ""a more lethal force,"" strengthening alliances and attracting new partners, as well as reforming the department ""for greater performance and affordability.""

In his memo, Esper explained that building a more lethal force would be the “surest way to deter adversary aggression” and included fully preparing for war. He wrote that it’s important to “continue to build readiness to fight” while “modernizing key capabilities for future conflict.”

Esper explained that U.S. allies and partners “play an essential role in helping us deter conflict and defend freedom around the world.” He added that through continued engagement the country will “grow these relationships and deepen our interoperability.”

TRUMP PUTS ARMY SECRETARY IN CHARGE OF PENTAGON AS SHANAHAN DROPS OUT OF CONTENTION FOR SECDEF

Esper graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1986. He received his commission in the infantry and completed Ranger and Pathfinder training.

He served on active duty for over a decade. In the early '90s, he served with the 101st Airborne Division in the Gulf War. He later commanded an airborne rifle company in Europe.

Following his service on active duty, he served in both the Virginia and District of Columbia National Guard and Army Reserve. He retired in 2007.

“Having previously served in the Regular Army, National Guard, and Reserve, I understand well the sacrifices our Service Members, Civilians, and their Families make to protect this great country,” Esper wrote in the memo. “This is why I am committed to taking care of Families and ensuring they have the resources they need to thrive.”

He encouraged soldiers, sailors, airmen marines and civilians to stay focused on their mission and “always do the right thing.”

“Together, we will remain the most ready and capable military force in the world, which is what our nation expects and deserves,” Esper said.

Justice Department Border Video: More to Do with Obama than Trump,https://www.nationalreview.com,"['A. G. Hamilton', 'Kevin D. Williamson', 'Andrew C. Mccarthy', 'Victor Davis Hanson', 'David French', 'Jason Epstein', 'Kathryn Jean Lopez', 'Jack Crowe', 'Kyle Smith', 'Read More']",06-24-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/06/what-the-viral-border-patrol-video-leaves-out/,"(Joshua Roberts/Reuters)

News outlets seized on the video as evidence of the Trump administration’s cruelty, but they omitted the crucial context.

In an attempt to justify Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s absurd comparison of American detention facilities to Holocaust-era concentration camps, many figures within the media have shared a viral video clip of a legal hearing in which a Department of Justice attorney debates a panel of judges as to what constitutes “sanitary conditions.” The majority of the shares were of a version put out by NowThis News, which claimed that the video shows a Trump administration official arguing that “children don’t need soap, toothbrushes, or beds to be ‘safe and sanitary’ while in Border Patrol custody.” The claim has led to several days of outrage, and has been used repeatedly as evidence that the current administration is being intentionally cruel to migrant children. Countless journalists, along with clickbait outlets such as The Hill and the Huffington Post , have highlighted the video inside this framing.

Unsurprisingly, it is not that simple. Indeed, the hearing in the video was related not to actions taken by the Trump administration, but to a challenge of a 2017 ruling that the CBP under the Obama administration had violated the Flores Settlement agreement with its treatment of children in custody. The judge in that case cited specific infractions that she felt were in violation of the “safe and sanitary” requirement under the Flores agreement and recommended a special monitor be appointed to ensure these facilities were complying with the original standard. The DOJ attorney in the video, Sarah Fabian, was not arguing that the United States should decline to provide those items to children, but rather that the Flores Settlement agreement didn’t specifically require those items. The notoriously liberal Ninth Circuit judges disagreed with this argument, preferring to read Flores narrowly. Fabian has been arguing similar cases on behalf of the Justice Department for years; that is her job. Some of her legal arguments have upset immigration advocates before. But they have never led to this type of media coverage, or to the claim that her fulfilling her legal role is indicative of a moral shortcoming.

Predictably, the vast majority of the people and the outlets that shared this exchange failed to note that the violations being discussed had occurred during the previous administration, while those who did know failed to ask themselves (and others) why the violations didn’t receive similar coverage when they were first exposed. Instead, they jumped straight to the conclusion that the federal government, headed up by President Trump, was deliberately inflicting pain on babies. This isn’t true.

It wasn’t true during the Obama administration either. Then, as now, the violations weren’t part of an intentional or evil ploy, but were the product of the system’s being overloaded. Then, as now, the intended care at these facilities was humane, and consistent within the requirement under Flores. In 2014, the Obama administration was dealing with a serious crisis: a large influx of unaccompanied minors that strained the facilities. In 2019, the Trump administration is dealing with a serious crisis: a large influx of unaccompanied minors that strains the facilities. In consequence, across multiple years and multiple administrations, the DOJ has repeatedly argued in court that the Flores Settlement agreement should be read narrowly, or allow for exceptions in difficult times. Certainly, governments make mistakes. Certainly, some facilities have taken shortcuts, as the result of either bureaucratic incompetence or limited resources. But those infractions will be fixed by additional funding, additional facilities, better oversight, and quicker processing, not by pretending that the president is a tyrant. The situation at the border is a difficult one, but selective outrage based on misleading facts won’t do much to address it.

This incident has been reminiscent of the recent outrage over pictures of “kids in cages” at detention facilities that, after a period, were revealed to date from the Obama administration. And, like that one, it has done a great deal of damage to our institutions, not only because it seems to neutral observers that the media gauges newsworthiness based on who is in the White House, but because the selective coverage and focus on imagined motives rather than real structural problems permits members of Congress to deflect from their own inaction, and thereby to ensure that the issues will continue ad nauseam."
"DHS boss McAleenan accused of opposing, leaking planned ICE raids",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Brooke Singman', 'Brooke Singman Is A Politics Reporter For Fox News. Follow Her On Twitter At']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/mcaleenan-accused-leaking-ice-raids,"Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan is being accused of leaking plans last week for scheduled Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids, after expressing fierce opposition and allegedly ordering top officials to “stand down” on the operation.

A source familiar with the matter told Fox News that when the operation was in its planning phase two weeks ago, McAleenan ordered ICE Acting Director Mark Morgan to call off the deportation operation that was expected to target 2,000 families in up to 10 cities across the country. President Trump, however, ordered that Morgan continue as planned -- until he abruptly announced Saturday he was delaying the raids to see if Congress could work out a solution to the ""Asylum and Loophole problems at the Southern Border.""

TRUMP DELAYS PLANNED ICE RAIDS TO SEE IF CONGRESS CAN SOLVE BORDER CRISIS

The source told Fox News that Homeland Security officials had been planning the raids since April—prior to former acting ICE director Ron Vitiello’s departure from the administration amid a DHS staffing shake-up—and that McAleenan had been opposed to the plans from the start.

“He is the one that wanted to make sure this operation did not go forward,” the source told Fox News. “He has been fighting this operation since its inception.”

On Friday, The Washington Post published a story with explicit details of the planned raids, citing U.S. officials familiar with the operation. The story, written by Post immigration reporter Nick Miroff, said the raids would take place before dawn, in major cities including Houston, Chicago, Miami and Los Angeles. Miroff also reported that the planned raids would begin on Sunday.

Tom Homan, the former head of ICE, first suggested in an interview Saturday on ""Fox & Friends"" that McAleenan was behind that story as he accused the DHS leader of working against the ICE operation.

“You’ve got the acting secretary of Homeland Security resisting what ICE is trying to do,” Homan said. “He does not support this operation, and I tell you what, if that’s his position, then he’s on the wrong side of this issue.”

He noted that the leaked story ""gave the location of the cities, the day this was supposed to start, how many targets"" and added: ""This leak -- which I know where the leak came from, I think we all know where the leak came from, that story only benefits one person -- put these officers at greater risk of harm.""

The source familiar with the matter also told Fox News that McAleenan traveled on a government plane to the border with Miroff, just 48 hours before the story was published.

“To have somebody within DHS leak this information that would have put the general public, as well as our officers in danger—that is one of the most egregious leaks I have ever seen in my life,” the source told Fox News, noting that “you can’t go forward with an operation once everyone knows the time, the place, the details. ICE officers and other law enforcement would have been put directly in harm's way.”

Sources also told The Washington Examiner that McAleenan was behind the leak.

Representatives for DHS and ICE have not responded to Fox News’ request for comment on the allegations against McAleenan.

Following the publication of the Post story, ICE said in a statement that “due to law-enforcement sensitivities and the safety and security of U.S. Immigrants and Customs Enforcement personnel, the agency will not offer specific details related to enforcement operations.”

ICE did say, however, that it prioritizes arresting and removing those illegal immigrants “who pose a threat to national security, public safety, and border security.”

TRUMP DOUBLES DOWN ON EXPECTED ICE RAID AMID PUSHBACK FROM LOCAL DEM POLITICIANS

By Saturday morning, the president announced that the plan would be delayed for two weeks to give congressional Democrats and Republicans time to come to a bipartisan solution on the border crisis. Trump warned, though, that if an agreement could not be reached, deportations would begin.

The change of plans came after Trump, earlier in the week, said that ICE would “begin the process of removing millions of illegal aliens who have illicitly found their way into the United States.”

On Saturday night, in an interview with Jeanine Pirro on Fox News' “Justice with Judge Jeanine,” Morgan said the postponement of the raids would “give Congress another chance on a bipartisan method to actually get together, pass this supplement, so that we can enforce the rule of law, positively impact this crisis and maintain the integrity of this system.”

He added: “I’ve got the green light to, anyone that’s here in violation of federal immigration law, I have the authority and the support to go after them, apply consequences, and remove them.”

(Lucy Nicholson/Reuters)

The Department of Justice official pictured in a viral video clip debating what specifically constitutes “sanitary conditions” under a court decision governing the detention of minors has received “several” death threats since the clip’s contents were reported by a number of news outlets last week, DOJ spokeswoman Kerri Kupec told National Review on Monday.

An edited version of Sarah Fabian’s Tuesday testimony before a panel of Ninth Circuit judges was published on Twitter by NowThis News on Friday under the headline: “A Trump official tried to argue that detained children don’t need soap, toothbrushes, or beds to be ‘safe and sanitary’ while in Border Patrol custody.”

A number of media outlets, including the The Hill and the Huffington Post, then highlighted the videos as evidence of the Trump administration’s willful mistreatment of migrants.

Fabian did not argue that children held in federal custody should not be given basic toiletries — as the viral headlines suggest — but rather suggested that the Flores Settlement agreement, a 1997 court ruling which governs the conditions under which minors can be held in federal custody, does not explicitly require the provision of those specific items.

Furthermore, Fabian’s testimony was related to a challenge of a 2017 ruling that U.S. Customs and Border Patrol, under President Obama, violated Flores by failing to provide children with basic sanitary products. The judge presiding over that case found that those items should be provided under Flores and recommended the appointment of a special monitor to ensure CPB provided the items going forward.

The treatment of migrants at CPB holding facilities has received greater scrutiny in recent weeks amid reports that CPB and the Department of Health and Human Services, which assumes custody of the migrants after they are processed by CPB, are unequipped to safely house and provide medical care for the overwhelming number of asylum-seekers arriving at the border each day.

Administration officials have asked Congress for additional funding to address what they claim has become a crisis at the southern border. They have also pleaded for legislative reforms that would grant CPB agents greater latitude to immediately deny entry to asylum seekers if their claims are clearly illegitimate.

By John Roach, AccuWeather staff writer June 25, 2019, 8:15:16 AM EDT



The rain and flooding that has affected Corn Belt farmers continues to be reflected in the poor Crop Progress numbers, according to Monday's latest update from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). The percentage of corn considered ""good"" or ""excellent"" in 18 key corn-producing states dropped from the previous week from 59% to 56%. The five-year average for the condition of corn rated ""good"" or ""excellent"" is 77%.

""The percentage is going down -- and that's a bad direction,"" said AccuWeather senior meteorologist Jason Nicholls. ""It's not that it dropped all that much, it's just the fact that it has dropped at all is surprising ... The heavy rains in southern Illinois and parts of Missouri that got 3 to 5 inches contributed to the deterioration.""

Missouri had just 28% of its corn rated ""good"" or ""excellent,"" while Ohio had 39%, Michigan had 40% and Illinois was at 47%.

Some good news for Corn Belt farmers: ""This week, the weather will turn and get drier,"" Nicholls said.

Soybean planting, as AccuWeather predicted, rose in 18 key U.S. soybean-producing states, according to the Crop Progress. The report showed 85% of soybeans were planted as of June 23, after the percentage was at 77% the previous week. The five-year average for the date is 97%.

North Dakota (65%), Missouri (66%) and Michigan (69%) continue to show the worst percentages, while Louisiana (99%), Minnesota (98%) and North Dakota (98%) lead the way.

""Those three states still in the 60s, especially Missouri, are going to end up losing some soybean acres because of the wet weather,"" Nicholls said.

For the year, AccuWeather predicts 2019 U.S. corn and soybean production will be below 2017 and 2018 and even below the USDA 2019 estimates.

There were 14.61 and 14.41 billion bushels of corn produced in the U.S. in 2017 and 2018, respectively. AccuWeather initially predicted 13.60 billion bushels but revised that number to 13.26 on June 10. The initial USDA estimate for 2019 was 15.03 billion bushels, but that number was revised June 11 to 13.68.

For soybeans, there were 4.412 and 4.5444 billion bushels produced in the U.S. in 2017 and 2018, respectively. AccuWeather initially estimated U.S. soybean production at 4.001 billion bushels and revised the estimate to 3.952 billion bushels on June 10. The initial USDA estimate for 2019 was 4.15 billion bushels, which was unchanged when the USDA produced its June 11 estimate.

Reporter

In March, I published a post about a report detailing up to $1 billion in federal funds wasted on charter schools that never opened, or opened and then closed because of mismanagement and other reasons. The report — titled “Asleep at the Wheel” and published by the Network for Public Education, a group that advocates for public schools — also said that the U.S. Education Department does not adequately monitor how money it uses for grants in its Charter Schools Program is spent.

A few days later, the report was raised at a House subcommittee hearing by Rep. Rosa L. DeLauro (D-Conn.), who asked Education Secretary Betsy DeVos about it. DeVos, a big supporter of charter schools, said that schools that don’t “make it” should be closed. The full House recently passed a spending bill that would provide more funding than ever for the Education Department, though charter school funding would be cut by nearly 10 percent.

Now, one of the authors of “Asleep at the Wheel,” Carol Burris, is back with an update. Her conclusion: The waste and fraud may be worse than the original report stated, as she explains in the following piece. Burris is executive director of the Network for Public Education and a former award-winning principal in New York.

[How does a $50 million charter scam work? Here’s what happened in California (before 11 people were indicted).]

It is worth noting that the original report said that the Education Department in Republican and Democratic administrations has “largely ignored or not sufficiently addressed” recommendations to improve the Charter Schools Programs made by the department’s own inspector general.

By Carol Burris

A few weeks ago, 11 people connected to online charter schools in California were indicted on criminal charges of grand theft, conspiracy, personal use of public money and financial conflict of interest. More than $50 million was stolen by the alleged conspirators. The nonprofit charter management company at the center of the scandal is known as Academic, Arts and Action Charter Academies, popularly known as A3 Education.

The Voice of San Diego news organization reported that the A3 charter empire extended throughout the state of California — a “nonprofit” that was very profitable indeed: 2016 tax returns show the principals collected $14.2 million in taxpayer dollars while spending only $3.6 million.

According to those returns, $855,796 of that $3.6 million financed the salaries of Chief Executive Sean McManus and President Jason Schrock. McManus and Schrock also allegedly steered about $8 million into onshore and offshore bank accounts, a personal charity, and the $1.6 million home in San Juan Capistrano that they shared. Among the 11 indicted were former superintendent Steve Van Zant and charter school broker, Eli Johnson. Readers of The Answer Sheet might recognize their names from my 2016 blog about the schemes of Steve Van Zant, Sean McManus and Eli Johnson reported here and here.

[Why California’s charter school sector is called ‘the Wild West’]

Voice of San Diego details a clear and comprehensive account of how, through the deliberate and fraudulent manipulation of enrollment, A3 was able to fleece millions of dollars from California taxpayers. But the story begins long before the founding of A3 Education.

[In California’s charter world, a tangled web of for-profit companies and nonprofit schools]

From 2009-2015, McManus was the CEO of the Academy of Arts and Science Charter Schools for which he served as CEO from 2009-2016, developing his model of using cash-strapped, small districts as authorizers of online charter schools that draw students from all over adjoining counties in exchange for fees.

And who gave the seed money to start this adventure?

The U.S. Department of Education’s Charter Schools Program (CSP) did.

Eleven Academy of Arts and Sciences charter schools that used the for-profit K-12 curriculum received a total of $2,825,000 from the CSP state grant to California. Today, all 11 schools are closed.

Back in March, the advocacy group Network for Public Education released its report on the Department of Education’s Charter Schools Program — a federal grants program supporting charter expansions and start-ups. The report, “Asleep at the Wheel,” charged that the program is rife with misspent and poorly vetted grants. At the time, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos scoffed at the report, saying “I’m not sure you can even call it a report,” and dismissed it as the work of those with a “political agenda.”

The Network for Public Education, however, continued investigations, going state by state, documenting the failed and never opened charter schools that received grants. To date, we have analyzed the lists of grants given from 2009 to 2014 in 15 of the 40 recipient states. Some of the 15 states received multiple grants, others few.

We have found 1,203 charter schools in those 15 states alone that either never opened or have closed. This represents 40 percent of the total grantees.

The federal CSP funding given to these failed and nonexistent schools totals $326,518,634 — a sum that does not include state grants or other sources of taxpayer funding.

Here, following the report, we provide summaries for each state, as well as the list of closed charter schools and the amounts they received in federal start-up and or expansion funds. In the months ahead, we will add the additional 25 states, Guam and Washington, D.C., which all received CSP grants.

It appears we underestimated the waste in the report — the percentage of failed schools is higher than the 30 percent that we reported and given the limited number of states and years analyzed so far, it is likely that waste will exceed our estimate of $1 billion.

Charter schools that never opened or failed

In Michigan, we found 63 charter schools, nearly all of which received grants of $100,000 or more, that never opened. Just this spring, based on the history of failed grants, the Michigan Board of Education voted to stop the disbursement of funds from a new federal $47 million dollar grant while it investigates what happened to the funds given to charter schools that never opened or quickly failed.

Board President Casandra Ulbrich cited the “Asleep at the Wheel” report as the board’s motivation for slowing down new grants.

“The report raised legitimate concerns about the oversight and accountability associated with this grant,” she said. “As such, a majority of the State Board of Education attempted to slow down the process until we could ensure that taxpayer dollars were being used appropriately. I have requested final reports and financials for the entities that received funds but never opened a charter school to review.”

Michigan’s attorney general, Dana Nessel, stepped in and told the board that the State Education Department was obligated to disburse the funds. Ulbrich, however, will continue to investigate what happened to the substantial sums that went to the state’s “ghost” charter schools. Eighty percent of Michigan charter schools are run by for-profit companies.

Michigan is not alone. The small state of Maryland had 54 schools in the 2009-2014 federal data set that never opened. Overall, the percentage of Maryland charters that received federal grants but never opened or failed is an astounding 55 percent. Those schools, together, had received $7,901,164 in federal taxpayer dollars.

Forty-two percent of the Pennsylvania charter schools that received grants either never opened, closed or may not have ever been a charter school at all (an example is given below). Of those, the overwhelming majority (39 of 49) either never opened or were non-charters. Many received grants that exceeded $50,000.

Other states with grantee failure rates above 50 percent are Delaware (57 percent), Arkansas (52 percent) and Georgia (57 percent).

No-name charter schools get federal grants

The National Center for Education Statistics assigns a 12-digit code to all public and charter schools. Its school locator tool is current up to the 2017-2018 school year. Most of the time, the charter schools that received grants but never opened had not been assigned an NCES number in the database.

However, we found numerous cases in two states where the school not only did not have a NCES number, it did not even have a name.

Tennessee which has a 49 percent grantee failure rate, gave 38 grants of $10,000 each to schools that not only did not have a NCES number, they also did not have a listed name. Where did that $380,000 go? Apparently, the Department of Education has no idea. Nor do they (or taxpayers) know where 18 grants to Arkansas “no name and no NCES ID” charter schools went. Two of those grants were for $50,000.

Non-charter school recipients of CSP grants

The NCES school identifier provides not only school addresses but also school type. After not finding numerous Texas and Georgia schools on their state’s charter school list, we searched for the schools using the given NCES number. We discovered that the grantee was not a charter school but rather a neighborhood public school or magnet school. In some cases, the name was the same as the charter listed by the U.S. Department of Education, but in other cases it was not. There were 27 such grantees in Texas, and 38 in the state of Georgia.

Although we are happy that public schools benefited, it is additional evidence of the lack of supervision that the Education Department provides to a program designed to finance “high-quality charter schools” as either start-ups or expansions. As mentioned earlier, we also found nonschool organizations in Pennsylvania that received grants as well. One of those organizations was Three Cord Youth Services. Its story follows.

Fraud, corruption and self-dealing by grantees

Three Cord Youth Services, in York, Pa., was not a charter school. Nevertheless, it received a $45,000 state pass-through grant from the CSP. Three Cord Youth Services was one of several companies owned by the for-profit Three Cord LLC. The company and all of its subsidiaries, including a real estate firm, were operated by former basketball coach, Isiah Anderson who was the sole owner and stockholder.

Three Cord was also the charter management company that operated the charter school that Anderson founded in 2007. That charter school, New Hope, had also received a start-up grant of $93,660 from the federal Charter Schools Program.

Not only did Anderson own the management company, he also owned the building leased to New Hope Charter School. That was not the only way that he profited, however. According to the contract between the charter school and its management company, Three Cord was to receive 50 percent of all of the profits generated by the supposedly nonprofit charter school.

From 2009-2012, years in which the school’s student truancy rates were high and test scores were abysmally low, New Hope paid Anderson’s three companies — Three Cord Inc., Three Cord Youth Services LLC and I Anderson Real Estate a total of $5.24 million. When the charter school was shut down in 2012, it was revealed that its officials had violated the public officials and employees ethics law, nonprofit corporation law and the school’s own conflict-of-interest policy.

Another Pennsylvania Charter Schools Program grant recipient, Pocono Mountain Charter School was shut down in 2014. The school’s former chief executive was cited for improper dealings with the Shawnee Tabernacle Church where he served as pastor. After pleading guilty to tax evasion, the Rev. Dennis Bloom was sentenced to 10 months “for funneling more than $1.5 million in taxpayer money to himself, his family, his businesses, and his church.”

Cases of self-dealing between federal grant recipient charter school CEOs and their companies (and sometimes churches) are not infrequent among Charter Schools Program grant recipients.

The now-defunct Shekinah Radiance Academy of San Antonio, Tex., was part of a small chain of schools run by a highly paid superintendent who was also the pastor of the Shadrach Temple International. The dealings of the school and the church were so intertwined that they prompted not only a 2012 audit finding that the charter operator violated state law, but also complaints from Americans United for Separation of Church and State.

Like the CSP-subsidized Florida SLAM Academies founded by rap star Pit Bull, Texas also had its own celebrity charter, Prime Prep Charter School. Prime Prep was founded in 2012 by football and reality television star Deion Sanders and his partner D.L. Wallace. It received a $600,000 state pass-through grant from the Charter Schools Program to get it going.

Prime Prep was controversial from the start. Even before it opened, the Dallas Observer ran a long investigative piece on prior alleged for-profit charter dealings of D.L. Wallace and questionable real estate dealings between a Prime Prep charter school and the church in which it was to be housed. That church, Charity Church, whose founder had business dealings with Wallace, would later sue the charter school for nonpayment of rent.

During its tumultuous 2 ½ years in operation, it was the subject of multiple lawsuits. By 2014, the Texas Education Agency would be looking into conflict of interest allegations, violations of the National School Lunch Program and a failure to conduct employee criminal background checks.

It closed abruptly in 2015 giving students and teachers only one hour notice, owing money to the IRS, employees and vendors.

Even after the school closed, it was the subject of a federal and state investigation due to the disappearance of 100 laptop computers purchased with, you guessed it, federal CSP charter start-up funds.

It appears that Sean McManus of the California online A3 charter scam has left the country. But the multimillion-dollar heist of federal and California taxpayers’ funds for which he allegedly is responsible pales in comparison to the hundreds of millions of dollars in waste we are finding in our investigation of the U.S. Department of Education’s Charter Schools Program."

Nunes, R-Calif., said Monday on ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"" that Steele also must be interviewed by U.S. Attorney for Connecticut John Durham, whom Attorney General William Barr selected in April to examine the origins of the Russia investigation.

""The Clinton campaign and Democrats were paying Christopher Steele to do this,"" he said, noting how the Clinton campaign and DNC, through the opposition research firm Fusion GPS, funded the dossier's creation.

""We were never able to interview Christopher Steele. I think he needs to be interviewed by the Department of Justice and the U.S. Attorney in Connecticut.""

Regarding Steele's work, host Tucker Carlson pointed out that Nunes sent a letter to the FBI requesting information about a 2016 meeting between the ex-MI6 spy and State Department official Kathleen Kavalec.

Kavalec had met with Steele and documented his political motivations in writing -- particularly that Steele's client was ""keen"" to see his anti-Trump materials ""come to light"" prior to the election. Kavalec forwarded her written notes, in which she also pointed out that some of Steele's claims apparently were false, to a senior FBI executive.

On that front, Nunes said he would give the FBI until Friday before he sends a criminal referral to the Justice Department, remarking that the bureau's failure to respond would be ""clearly obstructing our investigation.""

Nunes added that the British government also should reach out to the U.S. to assist in the matter.

Agriculture Department buries studies showing dangers of climate change,https://www.politico.com,['Helena Bottemiller Evich'],06-23-2019,2019,6,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/23/agriculture-department-climate-change-1376413,"President Donald Trump and Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue have both expressed skepticism about climate change and appear to have suppressed research efforts on the topic. | Andrew Harnik/AP Photo POLITICO Investigation Agriculture Department buries studies showing dangers of climate change The Trump administration has stopped promoting government-funded research into how higher temperatures can damage crops and pose health risks.

The Trump administration has refused to publicize dozens of government-funded studies that carry warnings about the effects of climate change, defying a longstanding practice of touting such findings by the Agriculture Department’s acclaimed in-house scientists.

The studies range from a groundbreaking discovery that rice loses vitamins in a carbon-rich environment — a potentially serious health concern for the 600 million people world-wide whose diet consists mostly of rice — to a finding that climate change could exacerbate allergy seasons to a warning to farmers about the reduction in quality of grasses important for raising cattle.

Story Continued Below

All of these studies were peer-reviewed by scientists and cleared through the non-partisan Agricultural Research Service, one of the world’s leading sources of scientific information for farmers and consumers.

None of the studies were focused on the causes of global warming – an often politically charged issue. Rather, the research examined the wide-ranging effects of rising carbon dioxide, increasing temperatures and volatile weather.

The administration, researchers said, appears to be trying to limit the circulation of evidence of climate change and avoid press coverage that may raise questions about the administration’s stance on the issue.

“The intent is to try to suppress a message — in this case, the increasing danger of human-caused climate change,” said Michael Mann, a leading climate scientist at Pennsylvania State University. “Who loses out? The people, who are already suffering the impacts of sea level rise and unprecedented super storms, droughts, wildfires and heat waves.”

Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue, who has expressed skepticism about climate science in the past and allegedly retaliated against in-house economists whose findings contradicted administration policies, declined to comment. A spokesperson for USDA said there have been no directives within the department that discouraged the dissemination of climate-related science.

“Research continues on these subjects and we promote the research once researchers are ready to announce the findings, after going through the appropriate reviews and clearances,” the spokesperson said in an email.

“USDA has several thousand scientists and over 100,000 employees who work on myriad topics and issues; not every single finding or piece of work solicits a government press release,” the spokesperson added.

However, a POLITICO investigation revealed a persistent pattern in which the Trump administration refused to draw attention to findings that show the potential dangers and consequences of climate change, covering dozens of separate studies. The administration’s moves flout decades of department practice of promoting its research in the spirit of educating farmers and consumers around the world, according to an analysis of USDA communications under previous administrations.

The lack of promotion means research from scores of government scientists receives less public attention. Climate-related studies are still being published without fanfare in scientific journals, but they can be very difficult to find. The USDA doesn’t post all its studies in one place.

Since Trump took office in January 2017, the Agricultural Research Service has issued releases for just two climate-related studies, both of which had findings that were favorable to the politically powerful meat industry. One found that beef production makes a relatively small contribution to greenhouse gas emissions and another that removing animal products from the diet for environmental reasons would likely cause widespread nutritional problems. The agency issued a third press release about soy processing that briefly mentioned greenhouse gas emissions, noting that reducing fossil fuel use or emissions was “a personal consideration” for farmers.

By contrast, POLITICO found that in the case of the groundbreaking rice study USDA officials not only withheld their own prepared release, but actively sought to prevent dissemination of the findings by the agency’s research partners.

Researchers at the University of Washington had collaborated with scientists at USDA, as well as others in Japan, China and Australia, for more than two years to study how rising carbon dioxide in the atmosphere could affect rice — humanity’s most important crop. They found that it not only loses protein and minerals, but is also likely to lose key vitamins as plants adapt to a changing environment.

The study had undergone intensive review, addressing questions from academic peers and within USDA itself. But after having prepared an announcement of the findings, the department abruptly decided not to publicize the study and urged the University of Washington to hold back its own release on the findings, which two of their researchers had co-authored.

In an email to staffers dated May 7, 2018, an incredulous Jeff Hodson, a UW communications director, advised his colleagues that the USDA communications office was “adamant that there was not enough data to be able to say what the paper is saying, and that others may question the science.”

""It was so unusual to have an agency basically say: ‘Don't do a press release,’ "" Hodson recalled in an interview. ""We stand for spreading the word about the science we do, especially when it has a potential impact on millions and millions of people.""

Researchers say the failure to publicize their work damages the credibility of the Agriculture Department and represents an unwarranted political intrusion into science.

“Why the hell is the U.S., which is ostensibly the leader in science research, ignoring this?” said one USDA scientist, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid the possibility of retaliation. “It’s not like we’re working on something that’s esoteric … we’re working on something that has dire consequences for the entire planet.”

“You can only postpone reality for so long,” the researcher added.

With a budget of just over $1 billion, the USDA’s Agricultural Research Service — known as ARS — is often referred to as “one of the best kept secrets” in the sprawling department because of its outsize impact on society. The agency has pioneered a variety of major breakthroughs, from figuring out how to mass produce penicillin so it could be widely used during World War II to coming up with creative ways to keep sliced apples from browning, and has for decades been at the forefront of understanding how a changing climate will affect agriculture.

The agency has stringent guidelines to prevent political meddling in research projects themselves. The Trump administration, researchers say, is not directly censoring scientific findings or black-balling research on climate change. Instead, they say, officials are essentially choosing to ignore or downplay findings that don’t line up with the administration’s agenda.

Some scientists see the fact that the administration has targeted another research arm of USDA, the Economic Research Service, as a warning shot. Perdue is moving ERS out of Washington, which some economists see as retribution for issuing reports that countered the administration’s agenda, as POLITICO recently reported.

“There’s a sense that you should watch what you say,” said Ricardo Salvador, director of the food and environment program at the Union of Concerned Scientists. “It’s going to result in some pretty big gaps in practical knowledge. … it will take years to undo the damage.”

Among the ARS studies that did not receive publicity from the Agriculture Department are:



A 2017 finding that climate change was likely to increase agricultural pollution and nutrient runoff in the Lower Mississippi River Delta, but that certain conservation practices, including not tilling soil and planting cover crops, would help farmers more than compensate and bring down pollutant loads regardless of the impacts of climate change.

A January 2018 finding that the Southern Plains — the agriculture-rich region that stretches from Kansas to Texas — is increasingly vulnerable to the effects of climate change, from the crops that rely on the waning Ogallala aquifer to the cattle that graze the grasslands.

An April 2018 finding that elevated CO2 levels lead to “substantial and persistent” declines in the quality of certain prairie grasses that are important for raising cattle. The protein content in the grass drops as photosynthesis kicks into high gear due to more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere — a trend that could pose health problems for the animals and cost ranchers money.

A July 2018 finding that coffee, which is already being affected by climate change, can potentially help scientists figure out how to evaluate and respond to the complex interactions between plants, pests and a changing environment. Rising CO2 in the atmosphere is projected to alter pest biology, such as by making weeds proliferate or temperatures more hospitable to damaging insects.

An October 2018 finding, in conjunction with the USDA Forest Service, that climate change would likely lead to more runoff in the Chesapeake Bay watershed during certain seasons.

A March 2019 finding that increased temperature swings might already be boosting pollen to the point that it’s contributing to longer and more intense allergy seasons across the northern hemisphere. “This study, done across multiple continents, highlights an important link between ongoing global warming and public health—one that could be exacerbated as temperatures continue to increase,” the researchers wrote.

Those were among at least 45 ARS studies related to climate change since the beginning of the Trump administration that did not receive any promotion, according to POLITICO’s review. The total number of studies that have published on climate-related issues is likely to be larger, because ARS studies appear across a broad range of narrowly focused journals and can be difficult to locate.

Five days after POLITICO presented its findings to the department and asked for a response, ARS issued a press release on wheat genetics that used the term “climate change.” It marked the third time the agency had used the term in a press release touting scientific findings in two and a half years.

While spokespeople say Perdue, the former Georgia governor who has been agriculture secretary since April 2017, has not interfered with ARS or the dissemination of its studies, the secretary has recently suggested that he’s at times been frustrated with USDA research.

“We know that research, some has been found in the past to not have been adequately peer-reviewed in a way that created wrong information, and we’re very serious when we say we’re fact-based, data-driven decision makers,” he said in April, responding to a question from POLITICO. “That relies on sound, replicable science rather than opinion. What I see unfortunately happening many times is that we tried to make policy decisions based on political science rather than on sound science.”

President Donald Trump, for his part, has been clear about his views on climate science and agricultural research generally: He doesn’t think much of either.

In each of his budgets, Trump has proposed deep cuts to agricultural research, requests that ignore a broad, bipartisan coalition urging more funding for such science as China and other competitors accelerate their spending. Congress has so far kept funding mostly flat.

The president has also repeatedly questioned the scientific consensus on climate change. After the government released its latest national climate assessment in November, a sweeping document based on science, Trump bluntly told reporters: ""I don't believe it.""

Officials at USDA apparently took the hint and the department did not promote the report, despite the fact that it was drafted in part by its own scientists and included serious warnings about how a changing climate poses a threat to farmers and ranchers across the country.

The USDA’s failure to publicize climate-related research does more than just quell media coverage: It can also prompt universities, fearful of antagonizing a potential source of funding, to reconsider their own plans to publicize studies.

The saga of the rice study last spring shows how a snub from USDA can create spillover effects throughout the academic world.

Emails obtained by POLITICO from one of the study’s co-authors show that ARS communications staff actually wrote a release on the study, but then decided not to send it out. The Agriculture Department and UW in Seattle had initially planned to coordinate their releases, which would both be included in a press packet prepared by the journal Science Advances, which published the study in May.

The journal had anticipated there would be significant media interest in the paper. Several earlier studies had already shown that rice loses protein, zinc and iron under the elevated CO2 levels that scientists predict for later this century, raising potentially serious concerns for hundreds of millions of people who are highly dependent on rice and already at risk of food insecurity. This latest study by ARS and its academic partners around the world had confirmed those previous findings and — for the first time — found that vitamins can also drop out of rice in these conditions.

Several days before the paper was slated to be published, Hodson, the UW communications official, sent ARS communications staff a draft of the press release the university was planning to send out. ARS officials returned the favor, sending UW their own draft press release. The headline on USDA’s draft was clear: “Rising Carbon Dioxide Levels Can Reduce Vitamin Content in Rice,” though the body of the release did not mention the word “climate.”

All seemed to be on track for the rollout. A few days later, however, Hodson got a phone call from an ARS communications staffer. She told him that the agency had decided not to issue a press release after all and suggested UW reconsider its plans, noting that senior leaders at ARS now had serious concerns about the paper, according to the emails.

The staffer explained that officials were “adamant that there was not enough data to be able to say what the paper is saying, and that others may question the science,” Hodson wrote in his email to his colleagues shortly after the call.

Having the Agriculture Department question the data just days before its publication struck many of the co-authors as inappropriate. The paper had already gone through a technical and policy review within ARS, both of which are standard procedure, and it had gone through a stringent peer-review process.

Kristie Ebi, one of the co-authors from UW, replied to Hodson: “Interesting — USDA is really trying to keep the press release from coming out.”

Nonetheless, senior leaders at UW took USDA’s concerns about the paper seriously, Hodson said. (It also wasn’t lost on anyone, he said, that other parts of the university receive substantial grant funding from the Agriculture Department.) The university conducted an internal review and determined that the science was sound. It went ahead with its press release.

The USDA’s attempt to quash the release had ripple effects as far as Nebraska. After catching wind of USDA’s call to the University of Washington, Bryan College of Health Sciences, in Lincoln, Neb., delayed and ultimately shortened its own release to avoid potentially offending the Agriculture Department.

“I’m disappointed,” said Irakli Loladze, a mathematical biologist at Bryan who co-authored the rice paper. “I do not even work at the USDA, but a potential call from the government agency was enough of a threat for my school to skip participating in the press-package arranged by the journal. Instead, our college issued a local and abbreviated release.""

A spokesperson for Bryan College said that the institution supports Loladze’s work and noted that the college ultimately issued its own press release and covered the study in its own publications.

“There was no omission or intentional delay based on what others were saying or doing,” the spokesperson said.

Despite the efforts of the Agriculture Department, the rice paper attracted substantial international press coverage, largely because many of the outside institutions that collaborated on the study, including the University of Tokyo, promoted it.

Kazuhiko Kobayashi, an agricultural scientist at the University of Tokyo and co-author on the paper, said he couldn’t understand why the U.S. government wouldn’t publicize such findings.

“It’s not necessarily bad for USDA,” he said in an interview. “Actually, it’s kind of neutral.”

“In Japan we have an expression: sontaku,” he said, offering his own speculation about the political dynamic in the United States. “It means that you don’t want to stimulate your boss … you feel you cannot predict your boss’s reaction.”

A USDA spokesperson said the decision to spike the press release on the rice study was driven by a scientific disagreement, not by the fact that it was climate-related.

“The concern was about nutritional claims, not anything relating to climate change or C02 levels,” the spokesperson said in an email. “The nutrition program leaders at ARS disagreed with the implication in the paper that 600 million people are at risk of vitamin deficiency. They felt that the data do not support this.”

The spokesperson said no political appointees were involved in the decision.

Authors of the rice study strongly disagreed with the concerns USDA raised about their paper. In an email leading up to publication, Loladze, the Bryan College researcher, accused the department of essentially “cherry picking” data to raise issues that weren’t scientifically valid, according to the emails.

When the Agriculture Department chooses to promote a study, the impact can be significant, particularly for the agriculture-focused news outlets that are widely read by farmers and ranchers.

Earlier this year, when the agency decided to issue its release about the study finding that producing beef — often criticized for having an outsize carbon and water footprint — actually makes up a very small fraction of greenhouse gas emissions, the agricultural trade press cranked out several stories, much to the delight of the beef industry. The study had also been supported by the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association.

The USDA’s efforts to hide climate work aren’t limited to ARS. A review of department press releases, blog posts and social media shows a clear pattern of avoiding the topic. These platforms largely eschew the term “climate change” and also steer clear of climate-related terms. Even the word “climate” itself appears to have now fallen out of favor, along with phrases like carbon, greenhouse gas emissions, adaptation and sequestration.

In April, for example, USDA sent out a press release noting that USDA officials had signed on to a communique on the sidelines of a G-20 agricultural scientists' meeting that reaffirmed their commitment to “science-based decision making.” The release made no mention of the fact that most of the principles USDA had agreed to were actually related to “climate-smart” agriculture.

Scott Hutchins, USDA’s deputy undersecretary for research, education and economics, told POLITICO at the time that he emphasized science-based decision-making in the release — not climate — because that was the strength the participants brought to these international dialogues. He added that there was “no intent whatsoever” to avoid including the words “climate smart” in the release.

A spokesperson for USDA said that department leadership “has not discouraged ARS or any USDA agency from using terms such as climate change, climate, or carbon sequestration, or from highlighting work on these topics.”

But David Festa, senior vice president of ecosystems at the Environmental Defense Fund, which works with farmers and ranchers on climate mitigation, said tensions within the USDA over climate issues are preventing a more robust discussion of the effects of climate change on American agriculture.

“USDA really could and should be leading … and they’re not,” Festa said.

Aaron Lehman, an Iowa farmer whose operation is roughly half conventional, half organic grain, said farmers are simply not getting much information from USDA related to how to adapt to or mitigate climate change.

“My farmers tell me this is frustrating,” said Lehman, who serves as Iowa Farmers Union President.

The gap in the conversation is particularly pronounced right now, he said, as an unprecedented percentage of growers across the Midwest have had difficulty planting their crops because fields are either too wet or flooded — an extreme weather scenario that’s been disastrous for agriculture this year.

“Farmers have a sense that the volatility is getting worse,” he said.

“You get the sense that it’s very sensitive,” Lehman said of the current dynamic around climate science at USDA. “But if you can’t have an open conversation about it, if you feel like you’re being shunned, how are we going to make progress?”

Even during the George W. Bush administration, when climate change was first deemed a “sensitive” topic within ARS — a designation that means science and other documents related to it require an extra layer of managerial clearance — the department still routinely highlighted climate-related research for the public.

In the first three years of Bush’s second term, for example, USDA promoted research on how farmers can change their tilling practices to reduce carbon being released into the atmosphere, a look at how various farm practices help capture carbon into soil, and a forecast on how rising CO2 levels would likely affect key crops. The communications office highlighted work showing that using switchgrass as a biofuel in lieu of ethanol could store more carbon in soil, which would not only mitigate greenhouse gas emissions but also boost soil health. There was also a release on a study simulating how climate change would pose challenges to groundwater.

Under Bush, the department publicly launched a five-year project on “Climate Friendly Farming” and touted a sweeping initiative aimed at better understanding and reducing agriculture’s greenhouse emissions.

“Even a small increase in the amount of carbon stored per acre of farmland would have a large effect on offsetting U.S. greenhouse gas emissions,” an ARS release noted in 2005.

Jim Connaughton, who served as chairman of the White House Council on Environmental Quality and director of the White House Office of Environmental Policy during the Bush administration, said he was encouraged that USDA and other agencies have so far been able to continue conducting climate science even as the issue has become more politically sensitive within the current administration. However, he noted it was “really unusual” for research agencies to systematically hold back scientific communication.

During the Bush era, he said, “The agencies were unfettered in their own decisions about publicizing their own science.”

“The tone from the top matters,” he added. “The political appointees are taking signals about their own communication products.”

During the Obama years, USDA became increasingly outspoken about climate change and the need to involve agriculture, both in terms of mitigation and adaptation.

The department came up with sweeping action plans on climate change and climate science and highlighted its work on a number of different platforms, including press releases, blog posts and social media blasts. In 2014, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack also launched Climate Hubs in 10 regions across the country aimed at helping farmers and ranchers cope with an increasingly unpredictable climate.

“We were trying to take science and make it real and actionable for farmers,” said Robert Bonnie, who served as undersecretary for natural resources and the environment at USDA during the Obama administration. “If you’re taking a certain block of research and not communicating it, it defeats the purpose of why USDA does the research in the first place.”"

His LinkedIn profile lists “June 2019” as the end of his Treasury job, without providing a specific date. Bloomberg wrote last week about Phillips’ departure.

Phillips’ LinkedIn profile now says: “He supported Secretary Mnuchin in the development of policy for comprehensive housing finance reform.”

What it doesn't say: Oversaw the privatization of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

Phillips, the ultimate Wall Street insider, was seen by some as the great hope for reforming and releasing the government-sponsored enterprises, or GSEs, from government conservatorship. In a New York Times story last month saying he planned to leave, Phillips said he would return to Wall Street but didn’t have a job lined up yet. His LinkedIn profile doesn’t list a current position.

Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Mark Calabria said earlier this month that he hoped Treasury’s plan to release Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac would come by the end of June. The White House is reviewing a draft of the proposal, Bloomberg reported last week, citing people familiar with the matter. The two mortgage giants guarantee more than half of the outstanding residential mortgages in the U.S., according to Federal Reserve data.

The departure of Phillips “matters” to the prospects of getting Fannie and Freddie back to anything resembling the footing they had before the housing crisis a decade ago, Jaret Seiberg, Managing Director at Cowen Group, said in a note to clients on Friday.

“Phillips was one of the few senior folks at Treasury with the clout to negotiate on GSE reform,” Seiberg wrote in the note. “While we believe he finished the Treasury white paper on GSE reform before he left, his departure means that Phillips cannot push the National Economic Council to approve the document. More broadly, Mnuchin has few other senior advisers and he devotes much of his time to trade disputes. The argument is that Mnuchin simply lacks the time and energy needed to advance a housing finance reform plan given the controversy that will surround any plan to recap and release Fannie and Freddie.”

After more than three decades at Wall Street firms, some of it spent as a mortgage trader, Phillips joined the Trump administration in 2017. He left a position as managing director at BlackRock to become Mnuchin’s top housing advisor. Prior to BlackRock, he held managing director positions at both Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse, according to LinkedIn.

Last year, Phillips said in a speech at the Mortgage Bankers Association’s annual conference in Washington D.C. that the Trump administration wants to end the government takeover of Fannie and Freddie that began in July 2008 during the financial crisis.

“The administration advocates ending the conservatorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and returning them to private ownership,” Phillips said. “Their charters should be removed from statute and their operations should be overseen by the primary regulator that has the authority to approve additional guarantors to introduce competition into the secondary mortgage market.”"
Why weak leadership at the Defense Department could lead us to war in Iran,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Michael J. Stricof', 'Michael J.

Michael J. Stricof is a doctoral candidate studying American history at Aix-Marseille Université.

Tensions are escalating between the United States and Iran. After Iranians shot down an American drone, President Trump weighed the option of a retaliatory strike, which he then called off because of potential casualties. Yet as bellicose rhetoric builds, the prospect of war continues to loom.

The possibility of war with Iran has sent commentators scrambling for comparisons to the second Iraq War. Destroyed ships in the Gulf of Oman also call up memories of the Gulf of Tonkin incident, which led to open American involvement in Vietnam in 1964. However, there is another historical comparison that may better capture the state of the current leadership in Washington and the risk of a different, dangerous path to war.

In December 1992, lame duck President George H.W. Bush committed U.S. troops to a U.N.-sanctioned humanitarian relief operation in Somalia. Operation Restore Hope was supposed to be a relatively simple mission: Deliver food and medical supplies to a war-torn country, but stay out of the fighting. It was the sort of operation that many were rallying behind in the immediate post-Cold War era; President-elect Bill Clinton publicly supported the move.

Ten months later, however, on Oct. 3, 1993, two Black Hawk helicopters carrying elite Delta Force soldiers, assigned to capture the Somali warlord Mohamed Farrah Aidid, were shot down over Mogadishu. This incident, infamous for images of mutilated bodies dragged through the streets, ended with 13 Americans killed and one captured. A mission designed to offer peaceful aid had slid, almost unnoticed, into a Special Forces operation and ended with a firefight in the streets and an American defeat.

While in many ways a very different situation than the current tensions building around Iran, the Somalia example reveals that weak leadership at the Defense Department, which we have again today, can be catastrophic in a period of potential conflict.

How did a humanitarian assistance mission lead to a Special Operations debacle? After all, American soldiers weren’t supposed to be looking for firefights; they were supposed to be distributing food. While a considerable amount of the shifting mission had to do with changing U.N. missions, on the American side the problem was due to a lack of leadership, notably in the Defense Department itself.

When Bush committed troops, he knew he would be leaving an ongoing military operation in the hands of his successor. This meant near-immediate turnover at every level of management except for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, where Colin Powell would remain chairman until September 1993.

In addition to the usual changeover at the beginning of an administration, Clinton’s team got off to a rocky start because Defense Secretary Les Aspin was largely ineffective. He had no major management experience. While he had been chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, his collegial style did not mesh well with the tightly run Pentagon. Aspin also spent much of his first six months in office distracted by social issues, forced to handle the firestorm over Clinton’s attempt to allow gays to serve openly in the military, leading to the mixed “Don’t ask, don’t tell” policy, and addressing women in combat roles and sexual assault in the military following the 1991 Tailhook aviators conference scandal.

Aspin wasn’t the only one distracted. In the first half of 1993, no one in Washington was really paying attention. Clinton was focused on his domestic agenda, including his struggles to implement new deficit reduction measures. National security adviser Tony Lake meanwhile was preoccupied with elaborating a broader strategy of “Engagement and Enlargement,” which encouraged new post-Cold War deployments. That left the Defense Department to resist the “mission creep” that eventually led to disaster.

In traditional circumstances, this would have been fine. The Defense Department is historically conservative about the use of American military power. Institutional concerns with maintaining resources and a ready force for real threats to American security make it resistant to other missions, often leading it to push back against political or diplomatic leaders hoping to bring U.S. force to bear as a solution to less-than-existential threats.

Some of this traditional dynamic played out in the early months of the Clinton administration. Famously, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Madeleine Albright, who supported more direct U.S. involvement in Bosnia, frustratedly asked Powell, “What’s the point of having this superb military that you’re always talking about if we can’t use it?” In his memoir, Powell described his reaction: “I thought I would have an aneurysm. American GIs were not toy soldiers to be moved around on some sort of global game board.”

But in the fall of 1993, Powell was on his way out. He had finished his time as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and was preparing to retire at the end of September, just a few days before the Black Hawk incident.

Aspin meanwhile was focused on rolling out a major policy review. He would later be blamed for not approving additional backup for the Army Rangers and Delta Force before the mission to capture Aidid began. Although there is debate among historians about the importance of Aspin’s decision, it gave the Clinton administration somewhere to lay the blame.

In reality, however, as journalist David Halberstam put it, it was “the vagueness and drift in the administration’s policy” that deserved more of the blame for the Battle of Mogadishu. The lack of leadership in the Pentagon, while the president and the national security adviser focused on other things, allowed the mission to creep toward outright combat without any real debate over the potential risks.

The debacle, which outraged Americans, cost Aspin his job. The Clinton administration eventually found its footing in defense, although not before overlooking genocide in Rwanda and retreating from Haiti while the shock of defeat in Somalia wore off.

Today, circumstances are in some ways very different from 1993. It’s not the first year of the president’s term, and an experienced national security adviser, John Bolton, is in place. But there is again weak leadership at the Defense Department at a precarious moment. The well-respected secretary Jim Mattis departed in December over policy disagreements with the president. Acting secretary of defense Patrick Shanahan proved weak, uncomfortably trying to please Trump by justifying the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Syria, which Mattis had refused to do, prompting his resignation. Now Shanahan, too, is out, and a new acting secretary, Army Secretary Mark T. Esper, is in.

Trump has said he doesn’t want to start a war with Iran, but he has also been sending mixed messages. And the weakness at the Defense Department could prove especially significant in the bureaucratic negotiations that shape the president’s agenda.

Bolton has long been an unabashed hawk, and the fear in policymaking circles is that he will push toward war. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, another hawk on Iran, is also sounding threats. Normally, the defense secretary could be counted on to argue against committing U.S. troops. However, a Defense Department lacking leadership leaves a power vacuum that makes it possible that these other voices will win out.

Inattention in the Pentagon also can lead to poorly managed situations that may lead to unplanned, explosive moments of conflict, as the retaliatory strike Trump called off Thursday illustrated. One Gulf of Tonkin-like incident with few voices arguing for caution could very possibly lead to open war, and a poorly managed war at that. Iran is not the only concern; the administration has practiced brinkmanship with North Korea, Venezuela and, via trade policy, China. Although the 1993 Somalia case ended with American withdrawal, history is full of examples that went the other way."

Trump’s Feud With Federal Reserve Is Rooted in Presidential History,https://www.nytimes.com,['Jeanna Smialek'],06-24-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/24/business/economy/federal-reserve-trump.html,"December 2018

Chatter about a firing

“I think he put out a tweet last night specifically saying he now realizes he does not have the authority to fire.” — Mick Mulvaney, who had recently been named the acting White House chief of staff, on ABC

That fourth rate increase fueled Mr. Trump’s ire and the president privately talked about firing Mr. Powell, telling advisers that the Fed chair would “turn me into Hoover,” a reference to the Great Depression-era president.

Spring 2019

Envisioning a ‘rocket ship’

“China will be pumping money into their system and probably reducing interest rates, as always, in order to make up for the business they are, and will be, losing. If the Federal Reserve ever did a ‘match,’ it would be game over, we win!” — Mr. Trump, on Twitter

With his re-election campaign looming, Mr. Trump has increasingly focused on the strength of the economy and portrayed the Fed as the skunk at a garden party. Mr. Trump has repeatedly said that the economy would take off like a “rocket ship” if not for Mr. Powell and that the stock market could be 5,000 to 10,000 points higher if the Fed had done its job “properly.” He has urged the Fed to start cutting rates, saying it is putting America at a disadvantage relative to its trading partners, like China and Europe.

June 2019

A potential demotion

“We’ll see what happens; they’re going to be making an announcement pretty soon, so we’ll see what happens.”— Mr. Trump, speaking to reporters about whether he would try to demote Mr. Powell

On the eve of a major Fed meeting, Bloomberg reported that the White House had looked into the legality of stripping Mr. Powell of his chair title and demoting him to a governor. The president himself seemed to imply that it was a possibility while talking with reporters on June 18. After the Fed’s June 19 meeting, at which the central bank signaled that rate cuts could be coming soon, Mr. Trump repeated in a television interview that he was unhappy with the Fed but said he had never suggested demoting Mr. Powell — though he said he believes he has the authority to do so.

The Past

A legacy of Fed bashing

“I was stunned. Not only was the president clearly overstepping his authority by giving an order to the Fed, but also it was disconcerting because I wasn’t planning tighter monetary policy at the time.” — Paul A. Volcker, former Fed chair, in his memoir “Keeping at It”

Other presidents have also seen the Fed as their nemesis.

By lifting rates, the central bank restrains economic growth in hopes of making it more sustainable into the future. Politicians, focused on their legacies and re-elections, do not like it when that happens on their watch.

Lyndon B. Johnson famously warred with his Fed chair, William McChesney Martin Jr. By some accounts, he pushed Mr. Martin against a wall at his Texas ranch and dressed him down over monetary policy at one contentious meeting in 1965.

Richard M. Nixon also pressured Mr. Martin’s successor, Arthur Burns, to keep rates low. The White House had its way, and many economists partly blame the Fed’s capitulation for the runaway inflation of the 1970s.

Mr. Volcker, who was the Fed chair from 1979 to 1987, said in his recent memoir that during a 1984 White House meeting with Ronald Reagan and James A. Baker III, then the chief of staff, Mr. Baker declared that “the president is ordering you not to raise interest rates before the election.” Mr. Volcker, who had not planned on raising rates and found the attack to be an overstep, walked out without replying."

Jeff Alson was sitting in his apartment in Ann Arbor, Mich., when he felt like he was going to explode.

The retired environmental engineer, who worked at the Environmental Protection Agency for 40 years, had just read a letter written by one of his old bosses, agency chief Andrew Wheeler.

In it, Wheeler told Congress that EPA career experts had not been cut out of the process of crafting one of the Trump administration's most controversial environmental proposals to date — one that would abandon one of President Barack Obama's signature climate policies.

Alson was one of those EPA experts before retiring in April 2018. He was fuming, he later said, because he believed what Wheeler was saying was wrong.

“I gave myself five minutes,” the 63-year-old retiree said in an interview Friday. “I sat there and tried to calm down. But I said, 'You know what? Enough is enough.' ""

Alson is speaking out at a moment of rising tension between Trump officials and California regulators as the federal government prepares to freeze in place pollution rules for new cars and light trucks for the next six years — rather than ratchet them up to rein in carbon emissions as the Obama administration wanted to do.

Wheeler and Mary Nichols, chairwoman of the California Air Resources Board, spent Thursday trading barbs after failed negotiations to allow California to keep its waiver allowing the state to set its own rules under the Clean Air Act, a practice the federal government has sanctioned for decades.

In prepared testimony, Nichols told lawmakers on the House Energy and Commerce Committee that in more than a dozen meetings with federal officials, “the Trump Administration has been unwilling to find a way” toward a resolution between with California.

She also said that “U.S. EPA’s professional staff and California’s engineers were cut out of this proposal’s development.”

Responding in his own letter to lawmakers, Wheeler said Nichols never offered a counterproposal and accused Nichols of not being “a good faith actor in this rulemaking.” He added that ""[h]er testimony that EPA professional staff were cut out of this proposal's development is false.”

It was that last statement that got Alson's blood boiling.

“I can speak from direct experience that Mary Nichols is telling the truth and Administrator Wheeler is lying,” he said.

According to Alson, under previous administrations technical staff at the EPA and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, part of the Transportation Department, would spend hours ironing out details of how fuel-efficiency standards should work before the agencies jointly rolled out the tailpipe rules for new cars.

But Alson said before the Trump administration's proposal was rolled out, there were no such technical meetings between the technical staffs of NHTSA and the National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory, the EPA's state-of-the-art facility in Michigan where investigators helped uncover the Volkswagen emissions scandal and where Alson worked for decades.

Instead, he said, there were only a few what he calls “check-the-box"" meetings between the agencies in early 2018.

“NHTSA was unwilling to tell EPA what they were doing,” Alson said. “At the end of the day, they completely controlled every piece of analysis.”

During a joint hearing of two House Energy and Commerce subcommittees Thursday, Democrats grilled the EPA’s air policy chief, Bill Wehrum, about his office's involvement in the proposal.

“Was it accurate that they had little involvement in the process?” said Rep. Paul Tonko (D-N.Y.), referring to the Office of Air and Radiation.

“Through the course of this rulemaking, EPA has had a substantial amount of involvement,” Wehrum responded.

EPA spokesman Michael Abboud reiterated the points made in Wheeler's letter. “The letter speaks for itself,” Abboud said. “Career, professional staff within the Office of Air and Radiation were involved in the development of the proposal and continue to be involved in the final stages as we work with NHTSA to finalize this rule.”

But documents released in the rulemaking process last year show bitter disagreement between the two agencies over the logic of the move.

The Transportation Department agency said that upping car mileage per gallon make new cars more expensive and lead to consumers putting off purchases. That, in turn, would mean more older cars on the road that would not perform well in accidents and more auto fatalities.

An internal EPA analysis at the time, however, found that not going through with the Obama-era rules would lead to slightly more fatalities. At one point, the disagreement became so pronounced that an EPA staffer asked for the agency's name and logo to be removed from a key regulatory report.

California and other states have vowed to challenge the freezing of the fuel-efficiency standards in court once they are finalized. If the EPA's technical staff were cut out of the process, as Alson contends, that may provide fodder for a lawsuit.

“The Clean Air Act requires EPA to be 'the decider' for its own rules, so IF it could be clearly shown in the record that EPA relinquished decision-making authority to NHTSA, that could be a problem for EPA in the courts,” Jody Freeman, director of Harvard Law School's Environmental and Energy Law Program, wrote by email.

Alson said he is going public now because most of his former colleagues still work at the agency and can't “set the record straight” without fear of reprimand.

“I felt a responsibility to do that because I'm the only person who could stand up and do that,” he said. “Everybody else who still works there can't say that.”

— White House unveils draft guidance on how agencies must account for climate change: The White House Council on Environmental Quality issued draft guidance Friday telling federal agencies they no longer have to take long-term climate impacts into account when reviewing how projects affect the environment.. The proposal means agencies “no longer have to take a project’s long-term climate impacts into account when assessing how they will affect the environment,” The Post’s Juliet Eilperin reports. The guidance reverses an April 2016 directive that agencies must quantify their long-term contribution to climate change.

But: Legal experts warn the new guidance: ""could cause further problems for the administration in court, where judges have suggested officials need to do a better job of assessing the climate impact of their decisions,"" Eilperin writes.

— Standoff continues in Oregon: After Republican senators walked out of the state capitol last week to avoid a vote on a climate change bill, the GOP members were absent again on Sunday.

One Republican state senator, Cliff Bentz, told the Oregonian in a phone interview from somewhere in Idaho that he’s glad there is increased attention around “one of the biggest issues of our time,” meaning climate change, and the party’s concern with the Democratic-backed cap-and-trade bill. The Post’s Reis Thebault and Michael Brice-Saddler reported Friday the state capitol was shut down because of credible threats from militia groups. “Friday night’s menacing escalation was the latest in a bizarre feud between the state’s Democrats and Republicans, who have clashed repeatedly during this year’s legislative session,” they write.

Why this is happening now: “Democrats have a supermajority in Oregon, allowing them the rare opportunity to pass the legislation of their dreams — but without Republicans, they can’t achieve a quorum,” Thebault and Brice-Saddler report. “No quorum, no vote. GOP senators said they had two options: allow a bill that they said would devastate their constituents to pass, or make a run for it.”

— Court strikes down federal approval for Cadiz pipeline: A federal judge has thrown out approval that the Bureau of Land Management under President Trump granted to Cadiz Inc. to build a water pipeline across public land in California. The agency under Trump reversed a 2015 decision by the Obama administration to say Cadiz could not use the existing railroad right of way across federal land, the Los Angeles Times reports.

— Climate-related studies blocked: The Trump administration has blocked the release of dozens of government-funded studies that warn about various climate-related dangers — all peer-reviewed and cleared by scientists at the non-partisan Agriculture Research Service, Politico reports.

A spokesperson for the Agriculture Department said there have been no such orders within the agency to stop the promotion of climate science. “The studies range from a groundbreaking discovery that rice loses vitamins in a carbon-rich environment … to a finding that climate change could exacerbate allergy seasons to a warning to farmers about the reduction in quality of grasses important for raising cattle,” per the report. “None of the studies were focused on the causes of global warming – an often politically charged issue. Rather, the research examined the wide-ranging effects of rising carbon dioxide, increasing temperatures and volatile weather.”

— Supreme Court sides with property owners: The high court sided in a 5-to-4 decision with a Pennsylvania woman in a case involving land-use regulations, overturning a precedent that required landowners to bring claims against local governments in state court before going to federal court. The ruling is “likely to have ripple effects on land use and environmental regulations,” E&E News reports. “[Chief Justice John Roberts] reasoned that landowners have a claim under the Fifth Amendment — which bars the government from taking property without compensation — as soon as the taking occurs and therefore have access to federal court right away.”

THERMOMETER

— A proposed wildfire fund in California: In an effort to assist utilities in the state and protect ratepayers from the rising costs associated with liability claims after catastrophic wildfires, California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) has proposed a new wildfire fund. The money for the $21 billion fund would be generated by $10.5 billion from extending an existing charge on utility customer bills, the Los Angeles Times reports, as well as $10.5 billion matched by investor-owned utilities. “The proposal stops short of meeting investor demands that the state change its doctrine of inverse condemnation, which holds utilities responsible for wildfire damage linked to their equipment,” per the report. “But Newsom’s advisors said they were confident that a fund coupled with a new safety certification process would stabilize the industry’s finances, ensure that wildfire victims can recoup losses and reduce fire risks.”

— What goes up must come down, as litter: According to the environmental nonprofit group Alliance for the Great Lakers, there were 18,000 balloons or balloon debris, including strings, found along the shorelines of the Great Lakes between 2016 and 2018, the Detroit Free Press reports. “Heightened understanding of problems associated with balloon litter has led five states to limit or ban intentional releases. At least eight others are considering restrictions,” per the report.

— Philadelphia refinery fire extinguished: The fire that erupted at a crude oil refinery in Philadelphia on Friday morning was extinguished over the weekend, as an investigation into the cause began. “Officials said the gas valve that had been fueling the blaze has been shut off and the tank involved in the explosion has been isolated,” the Associated Press reports. “Officials say the fire department’s hazmat unit and the public health department are still monitoring air quality. No threat to public health has been reported.”

— A bump in the road for the energy storage boom: Energy storage researchers and advocates are closely monitoring the ongoing investigation over an April fire and explosion of a massive battery in Phoenix. The incident underlined some of the concerns and risks associated with the burgeoning technology that will be key to the growth of renewable energy, the Associated Press reports. “Nearly all of the utility-scale batteries now on the grid or in development are massive versions of the same lithium ion technology that powers cellphones and laptops. If the batteries get too hot, a fire can start and trigger a phenomenon known as thermal runaway, in which the fire feeds on itself and is nearly impossible to stop until it consumes all the available fuel,” per the report. George Crabtree, director of the Joint Center for Energy Storage Research, told the AP the probe is “getting attention, and I think everyone realizes that too many safety incidents . . . will be detrimental going forward.”

I have my doubts about how much the commission can accomplish, but the criticisms of it from the Left are misplaced. My latest column examines the controversy.

There are two principal complaints, as related in the New York Times and The New Republic. The Trump administration is inconsistent on human rights, giving a pass to allies such as Saudi Arabia while coming down hard on adversaries such as Iran. And the commission will try to push a narrow theocratic conception of human rights, one that scants gay rights and the right to abortion.

The first complaint is correct, but not distinctive to President Trump. No administration is or can be entirely consistent on human rights. . . . The U.S. has a lot of interests and they cannot always be simultaneously pursued. The Barack Obama administration was softer than Trump on Iran and harder on Saudi Arabia, in keeping with its own larger foreign-policy aims. (Homosexual acts are punishable by death in both countries.) If the choice before our government were to advance human rights at all times and places or not to advance them at all, then the latter course would prevail."

Several Democrats criticized Monday the Trump administration after POLITICO reported the Agriculture Department has largely stopped promoting its own climate science.

Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who's also running for president, sent a letter to Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue expressing ""deep concern and alarm"" over the report. The Minnesota Democrat asked the department to explain its justification for not publicizing certain studies and to immediately release ""any [Agricultural Research Service] study related to climate science that was ignored, downplayed, or its findings held back.""

""When federally-funded scientific research is curtailed or withheld because of its attention to the consequences of climate change, farmers are cut out of participating in climate solutions and, at worst, unable to effectively mitigate and adapt their operations and infrastructure to its effects,"" she wrote.

Senate Agriculture Committee ranking member Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) tweeted the story, calling it ""outrageous.""

""Climate change is an urgent threat to our farmers,"" she said. ""The Administration should not be burying vital research that will help us understand and combat the effects of climate change.""

Sen. Patrick Leahy, ranking member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, also took to Twitter to criticize the department. The Vermont Democrat said USDA scientists lead the world in studying the effects of climate change.

""While our farmers fight against #ClimateChange, #USDA is shamefully fighting against #science,"" he wrote.

In addition to Klobuchar, two other 2020 contenders logged their disapproval. Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) tweeted about the story twice today and issued a statement.

For the rest of the people in St. John and the other places facing high cancer risks, there is still hope.

VA employees say agency is actively retaliating against whistleblowers,https://thehill.com,[],06-22-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/449882-va-employees-say-agency-is-actively-retaliating-against-whistleblowers,"Three employees at the Department of Veterans Affairs said in new interviews that they were sidelined at their jobs and stripped of responsibilities after they raised alarms about improper treatment of patients.

In interviews with USA Today the three staffers, physician Katherine Mitchell, CT technologist Jeffrey Dettbarn, and psychologist Minu Aghevli, Ph.D., said that they were removed from patient care positions to prevent them from learning of future or ongoing abuses at the agency.

The three are set to testify before Congress on a wide range of patient mistreatment this week.

""The VA is two-faced: What it says it does and what it actually does are two entirely different things,"" Mitchell told USA Today. ""Whistleblowers who are brave enough to report problems serve as a vital safety net for veterans. If people can’t identify problems, veterans will suffer and die. That’s what it boils down to.""

""As a physician, nurse, and basically as a human being, I will not back down if someone’s health or safety is being threatened,"" she added in the interview.

Dettbarn, who said he hoped to return to patient care, added that a culture of fear at the agency had led to few staffers advocating on behalf of patients.

""There's nobody there to watch out for the veterans,"" he told the newspaper. ""They've got everybody else scared to say anything. Who's taking care of those patients?""

Sidelining those who speak out, she added, ""jeopardizes the health and safety of every veteran in the system.""

A spokesman for the agency declined to comment to USA Today on the assertions from Mitchell and the others. In a statement to The Hill, an agency spokesperson stressed that the agency was working on implementing new improvements to protect whistleblowers.

""These include providing timelier resolutions, more responsive recommendations and enhancing communications with whistleblowers,"" the spokesperson said.

""VA does not tolerate retaliation against employees who have made a protected disclosure,"" the spokesperson continued. ""Any employee who feels they have been retaliated against for making a protected disclosure is encouraged to contact VA’s Office of Accountability and Whistleblower Protection (OAWP).""

Former Art Institute students in Phoenix may get loan relief following Republic report,https://www.azcentral.com,"['Rachel Leingang', 'Published P.M. Mt June']",06-24-2019,2019,6,https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona-education/2019/06/24/u-s-department-education-aid-former-art-institute-students-phoenix/1548210001/,"CLOSE

The U.S. Department of Education is stepping in to help former Art Institute of Phoenix students who were denied relief for their college debt.

The department said it is ""re-examining"" the cases of two students who were denied Closed School Discharge and notifying approximately 200 former Art Institute of Phoenix students of their eligibility to the program.

The department's move comes after reporting by The Arizona Republic showed multiple students who attended the Art Institute of Phoenix were denied help from a program that cancels federal student loans if a college closes.

A student loan servicer had told the students they weren't eligible for Closed School Discharge because they attended the campus in Las Vegas, not Phoenix.

One problem: They didn't.

The Phoenix campus closed in December, but the Las Vegas campus is still open. Regardless, that should not affect the Phoenix students' ability to get their loans discharged, according to federal rules.

In a statement on Friday, the department said it was ""re-examining"" the applications for Closed School Discharge for two students.

Brandie Lane and Christine Anderson both told The Republic last week that their student loan servicer, CornerStone, had denied their applications.

The department said it will also be reaching out to the 200 other students who attended the Art Institute of Phoenix.

""In an abundance of caution, we also will notify approximately 200 other students who attended Ai Phoenix that they may be eligible for a closed school loan discharge, and if they have already applied and been denied, they should contact their student loan servicer immediately,"" a department spokesperson said in an email.

Closed School Discharge allows students who attended campuses that shut down to get their student loans deleted if they were enrolled when the school closed or within 120 days of closure. (If they completed their degree before closure, participated in a teach-out or transferred credits to another school, they aren’t eligible for discharge.)

But it's not always straightforward to get loans canceled after a closure, as the situation with the Las Vegas-Phoenix confusion illustrates.

In recent years, Arizona has had several high-profile closures, affecting hundreds of students.

Often, students are left on their own to navigate complex bureaucracies. In this case, students said they could not get answers or assistance from anyone — the loan servicer, the school or the Department of Education.

Why were students denied?

Brandie Lane, a 22-year-old former Art Institute of Phoenix student, has about $40,000 in federal loans. She was on forbearance, a temporary stop to payments, for the Phoenix loans, but was taken off of it. Her account shows a payment of $360 is due July 4.

Christine Anderson, a 46-year-old who was pursuing an interior design degree in Phoenix,has about $30,000 in federal student loans for her time at Art Institute of Phoenix.

Lane and Anderson aren't the only students who were denied because the Las Vegas campus is open.

Thomas Gokey, organizer and co-founder of the Debt Collective, a group of borrowers who have banded together to share information and advocate for each other, said he’s heard from a dozen students with loans held by three different servicers. Many more may be affected, given the number of students who attended the school, he said.

For more stories that matter, subscribe to azcentral.com.

After The Republic article published, several other former Phoenix students reached out, saying they had been denied for the same reason.

Lane and Anderson also heard back from the ombudsman's office at their loan servicer after the story published, though now the company's reason for denying discharge has changed, Gokey said.

The ombudsman's office acknowledged the location error, but now the loan company is denying the discharge because the students could have transferred to another school to complete their programs, letters to the students state.

Students get to decide whether to transfer credits and continue their education, or seek Closed School Discharge if their campus shuts down. They are not required to transfer and continue at another school.

Anderson said she’s frustrated to now be getting denied for an entirely different reason than the Las Vegas campus being open.

“It’s an every day battle, it’s stressful. I think about it when I wake up, I think about it throughout the day. … I feel like I’m being harassed and bullied,” Anderson said.

If there's any solace in the situation, at least now other students are aware of the problem and know they can reapply, she said.

How did this happen?

The confusion over which campus Phoenix students attended relates to an identification number campuses use to access federal funds.

Typically, if the main location of a school closes, like Art Institute of Phoenix did, the other locations associated with it also would lose their eligibility for federal funds, even if they stay open, the department said in an email. The Vegas campus was once considered an additional location of the Phoenix campus.

A screenshot from The Art Institute of Phoenix's website shows a message stating that the school is no longer accepting new students. (Photo: Via The Art Institute of Phoenix)

But the Phoenix-Las Vegas situation is unusual: the Las Vegas campus had become an independent institution and had separate accreditation at the time Phoenix closed.

And the Las Vegas campus kept the school identifier — officially known as the Office of Postsecondary Education Identification number — that the Phoenix campus had in the federal system. Schools get assigned these numbers for the purposes of receiving federal funds.

That meant students' federal loans appeared to be associated with the Las Vegas campus instead of Phoenix because the identification number was the same.

Horrors! USDA moved a few bureaucrats out of D.C. to improve service,https://www.azcentral.com,"['Jon Gabriel', 'Opinion Contributor', 'Published A.M.

Opinion: Ignore the protests from bureaucrats. More federal agencies would be smart to move their operations away from Washington.

Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue wants to move a few D.C. employees closer to the farmers they regulate. (Photo: Jacquelyn Martin, AP)

It was a dramatic scene. As Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue spoke to his employees at an all-hands meeting in D.C. last week, several of them stood up and turned their backs to Perdue in silent protest.

I’ve never seen a similar protest at a private company’s staff meeting, although a few of my co-workers were known to silently nod off. Since I had grown accustomed to regular paychecks, I feigned rapt attention while elbowing my sleepy comrades.

What hideous scandal provoked so many loyal public servants to publicly oppose their boss and disrupt America’s beloved agricultural bureaucracy? The $22 trillion national debt? Creeping fascism? The inclusion of kale in Caesar salads?

No, agriculture workers were mad that the secretary is moving a few of them nearer the agriculture they’re regulating.

Work with those you regulate? Eww

“Following a rigorous site selection process, the Kansas City Region provides a win win – maximizing our mission function by putting taxpayer savings into programmatic outputs and providing affordability, easy commutes, and extraordinary living for our employees,” Secretary Perdue said in a press release.

“The considerable taxpayer savings will allow us to be more efficient and improve our ability to retain more employees in the long run. We will be placing important USDA resources closer to many stakeholders, most of whom live and work far from Washington, D.C.”

Don’t get too excited about the money saved, taxpayers. Perdue is only moving 547 employees out of nearly 100,000 employed by the USDA, or about half of 1%.

Still, this minor relocation, utterly common among the private sector, provoked protest and internal demands to unionize the two small sub-agencies affected.

Just imagine, agricultural regulators might be forced to associate with farmers. Eww.

Most agencies should move out of D.C.

This is a tiny step in the right direction, but most of our federal agencies should be moved out of the Beltway. Leave the departments of State, Defense and Treasury in Washington; those are the only three outlined in the Constitution to begin with. If we aren’t going to consolidate or eliminate the other agencies, at least move them closer to their mission.

The Department of the Interior should be, well, in the interior. As an Arizonan, I’m biased, but relocate it to the Grand Canyon State. After all, the federal government already owns nearly 39% of our state. Gila Bend is nice this time of year.

Shouldn’t Housing and Urban Development focus on a city that needs some help? Downtown Detroit is a perfect fit.

The U.S. News and World Report lists Alabama as the worst state for education. Why doesn’t Betsy DeVos move her thousands of employees to Birmingham? Perhaps they could expand their impact by volunteering for a few hours to tutor in local schools.

Maybe they'd serve people better

Six of America’s wealthiest counties surround Washington, D.C. Not only would these moves save taxpayers millions, but they would alleviate income inequality by spreading the government’s borrowed wealth. Why should the perpetual economic boom be limited to our capital?

Better yet, it would help bureaucrats to better serve and understand those whom they are supposedly helping.

If the cabinet secretaries need to commute every few weeks to the White House or Capitol Hill, that’s easy enough to accommodate. Or they could avoid the hassle by video conferencing like the rest of us.

Relocate the Department of Labor to the Rust Belt, the Department of Energy to the oil fields of North Dakota, and the Department of Transportation to the intersection of Interstates 80 and 25 in Cheyenne, Wyo.

And if the president ever needs an energetic Secretary of Veterans Affairs, I’m willing to relocate to any of our fine military bases in Hawaii. I’m not about to turn my back on that move.

White House says US is prepared to negotiate with Iran without preconditions,https://www.cnbc.com,['Spencer Kimball'],06-23-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/23/secretary-of-state-pompeo-us-ready-negotiate-with-iran-with-no-preconditions.html,"The Trump administration said over the weekend that the United States is prepared to negotiate with Iran without preconditions, days after the two countries nearly came to blows over a downed American surveillance drone.



President Donald Trump, when asked whether he had conditions for talking with Iran, said ""not as far as I'm concerned, no preconditions,"" though he reiterated that his administration expected Iran to discuss its nuclear program.

The president made his comments in a wide-ranging interview with NBC's ""Meet The Press.""



Trump's position was reiterated by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo as he prepared to depart for the Middle East.

""We're prepared to negotiate with no preconditions,"" Pompeo told reporters Sunday. ""I am confident that at the very moment they are ready to engage with us, we will be able to begin these conversations.""



But Vice President Mike Pence, in an interview with CNN's ""State of The Union,"" said ""Iran needs to understand we'll never allow them to obtain a nuclear weapon and we will not allow them to continue to sow violence across this region.""



Pence said he was not aware of any outreach from Iran.

Pompeo said he would travel to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to make sure that the U.S. is ""strategically aligned"" with its allies.

""We'll be talking with them about how to make sure that we are all strategically aligned and how we can build out a global coalition,"" Pompeo said.

Internal DHS and ICE immigration detention practices are broken,https://thehill.com,[],06-23-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/opinion/immigration/449937-internal-dhs-and-ice-immigration-detention-practices-are-broken,"This month’s damning report from the agency’s own inspector general, which rebuked ICE’s detention practices, including placing immigrants in solitary confinement, is an accountability decoy. In fact, the report only scratches the surface of their unlawful actions.

Our organization, Government Accountability Project, represents numerous whistleblowers within the DHS who have made multiple disclosures to the agency’s inspector general.

These whistleblowers saw egregious violations of laws, rules and regulations in practices that substantially threaten immigrants’ health and safety and reported those wrongdoings inside the system — to the people with the authority to investigate and address misconduct.

ADVERTISEMENT

One whistleblower we represent, Ellen Gallagher, was a senior policy analyst at the Department’s Office of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties (CRCL). After reading dozens of ICE segregation reports, she discovered that ICE regularly used solitary confinement practices against mentally ill and medically vulnerable detainees in violation of federal detention standards.

The abuses she discovered were graphic — detainees were denied proper medical care and attention; others were stripped bare and placed in “suicide smocks” in complete isolation, with some detainees choosing to not disclose suicidal ideation out of fear that they would be subjected to such treatment; and mentally-ill detainees were put in solitary confinement and de-scheduled from appearing before immigration judges despite having been determined to have a credible fear of returning to their home country. These abuses were systemic, not just one-time occurrences, with examples spanning from over 200 adult detention sites.

Gallagher first alerted her own colleagues of these abuses, since she understood the civil rights office’s mandate included both reviewing individual cases of misconduct as well as recommending policy changes to protect the rights and interests of immigrants in detention. When they declined to investigate, Gallagher brought the evidence of the misuse of solitary confinement at ICE detention facilities to the inspector general.

The inspector general promised to investigate whether ICE facilities use segregation properly and follow applicable detention standards. However, in two reports prior to the one issued last week, the watchdog failed to release any meaningful, site-wide data or conclusions regarding the use and impact of segregation for civil detainees in immigration custody. Even in this most recent report, the Inspector General only spot-checked four detention centers, none of which were mentioned in Gallagher’s whistleblowing disclosures. The report barely looked at mentally ill detainees. The recommendations suggested that the field offices that oversee the specific detention centers they investigated “ensure compliance” with existing federal detention standards, completely failing to address these same problems that exist across the entire ICE detention system.

Two other clients of ours, Drs. Scott Allen and Pamela McPherson, are medical and mental health subject matter experts working for the Department’s Office of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties. They too tried to raise concerns about risks of harm to immigrants, especially children, to both CRCL and the Inspector General’s investigative team. Their concerns have also fallen on deaf ears.

ADVERTISEMENT

Their disclosures detailed systemic weakness at Family Residential Centers that would exponentiate with expanded detention implemented under the zero-tolerance immigration policy and create imminent harm to migrant children. Last summer, we sent these disclosures to the Inspector General via fax and email.

We followed up with the watchdog throughout the fall by peppering them with emails. But the doctors’ disclosures went unanswered. As they wrote in the Washington Post last December, “We warned DHS that a migrant child could die in custody. Now one has.”

One watchdog’s non-response was echoed by the civil rights office, which, despite heightened outcry about harms posed by detention and the warnings of their own medical experts, has not conducted a single onsite investigation at family detention centers since September 2017. And perhaps even worse than non-action, DHS recently released a controversial new report in April 2019 that recommends confinement and detention of migrant children and overturning the Flores standards to allow for indefinite, prolonged detention.

This position is completely at odds with these whistleblowers’ disclosures, as well as the overwhelming medical research and consensus that detention of children, even with families, poses harm and indefinite detention exponentiates that harm.

Meanwhile, the abuses reported by these whistleblowers continue unabated, with no oversight or accountability by the agency watchdogs charged with promoting legal compliance and protecting the health, welfare and rights of immigrants held in civil detention. Because of the futility of internal oversight mechanisms, Gallagher and Drs. Allen and McPherson felt duty-bound to go to Congress and the press to raise the alarm and prevent foreseeable, ongoing risk of harm.

Twenty-four immigrants have died in ICE custody during the Trump administration.

Something is broken when the internal accountability mechanisms in the executive branch refuse to listen to whistleblowers, yet still claim to have held their agency accountable.

Yes, the recent Inspector General’s report did identify problems at four spot-checked sites exposed and recommend reforms for serious ICE abuses. But the striking contrast between the scope of the report and the scope of the problems we know have been raised by whistleblowers demonstrates that the OIG is not able, or willing, to meaningfully address ongoing and prevent future harms.

DHS’s watchdog mechanisms are broken and have consistently failed to prevent egregious harm to the thousands of vulnerable immigrants in DHS care. The concerns exposed by whistleblowers and reported in the press must not only be acknowledged, but fully investigated and addressed without any further delay. Congress must assert its oversight authority and exercise its oversight duty, immediately. The consequences of Congress failing to act are literally life and death.

At the time, the river was one of the most polluted in the US. Journalists filled glasses with pitch-black river water, while politicians dipped cloth into the waves that came up oil-soaked.

The river fire lasted roughly 20 minutes, but it sparked public outrage that in part led to the creation of the US Environmental Protection Agency, the federal office tasked with making sure ""Americans have clean air, land, and water.""

(Erin Scott/Reuters)

On Monday morning, Florida senator Marco Rubio sent a letter to the Trump administration calling on the United States to render aid to a woman in the United Kingdom who was ordered by a judge to undergo a forced late-term abortion.

“I write with grave concern about the case of a 22-week pregnant Catholic woman with developmental disabilities in the United Kingdom who — against the wishes of her and her Nigerian-origin mother — is being required by a British court to undergo a forced late-term abortion, in what I believe to be a clear human rights violation,” Rubio wrote in a letter addressed to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and DHS acting secretary Kevin McAleneen. “I urge your Departments to quickly investigate this case and, within all applicable laws and regulations, to offer assistance to her and her mother in seeking alternative medical care either in the United States through a temporary non-immigrant visa or through humanitarian parole for a temporary period due to this urgent humanitarian emergency, or at medical facilities in a third country that will not compel her to undergo a forced late-term abortion.”

On Friday, the Press Association and the Catholic News Agency first reported that an unidentified woman was being ordered by British judge Nathalie Lieven to undergo a forced late-term abortion because the pregnant woman, who is mentally disabled, could suffer from mental distress if the child were put up for adoption.

“’I think [the pregnant woman] would suffer greater trauma from having a baby removed [from her care],’ Lieven said, because ‘it would at that stage be a real baby.’” (Premature infants born at 22 weeks — the age of the child marked for death by Lieven — are capable of surviving outside the womb and living normal lives.) The New York Times reported that “a spokesman for the court confirmed public details of the case by email on Sunday, including the court proceeding and the judge’s comments.”

Trump's tax returns — DOJ trying to put off the inevitable?,https://thehill.com,[],06-23-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/449848-trumps-tax-returns-doj-trying-to-put-off-the-inevitable,"The Department of Justice (DOJ) finally submitted its brief explaining why the secretary of the Treasury and IRS commissioner are not complying with a Congressional subpoena issued to them from House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Nea for Donald Trump’s personal tax returns as well as business-related tax returns and return information from the IRS.

Essentially, the DOJ explained that it viewed the Congressional subpoena to be a pretext to obtain and then publicly disclose the President’s tax returns when he had made it clear that it was not his intention to do so.

The DOJ acknowledged that a plain-language reading of Section 6103(f) of the Internal Revenue Code required compliance and an obligation on the part of the IRS to turn over the requested tax returns — but then the DOJ divined and opined that Chairman Neal’s request had no legislative justification and was a pretextual means to a public disclosure end result that was ultimately motivated by politics.

GOP lawmakers want Mulvaney sidelined in budget talks MORE. Mnuchin also demurred compliance with the Congressional subpoena, explaining that his rejection of the subpoena was upon the advice of the DOJ, whose above referenced written opinion would be forthcoming.

The DOJ opinion asserted that the executive function of government, which the IRS and Treasury Department fall under, has an obligation to protect the confidentiality of tax returns and would not accept the authority of a written request under Section 6103(f) from Congress unless there was an acceptable legislative intent behind the tax return request.

It is here that the rubber meets the road, and it is here that the courts will make their analysis and ultimately their decision.

In anticipation of the coming legal battle over disclosure of Trump’s tax returns, the IRS Office of Chief Counsel drafted a legal opinion titled “Congressional Access to Returns and Return Information.”

IRS Counsel deals with requests for tax returns from authorized agencies every day in each of its offices around the country. There is no more experienced legal authority when it comes to discerning the nuances of IRS disclosure authority than IRS Counsel. It also should be noted that the draft disclosure opinion by IRS Counsel was formulated prior to the placement of current IRS Chief Counsel Michael Desmond, who took office in February 2019.

So President Trump Donald John TrumpConway defends herself against Hatch Act allegations amid threat of subpoena How to defuse Gulf tensions and avoid war with Iran Trump says 'stubborn child' Fed 'blew it' by not cutting rates MORE had in place both his hand-picked IRS commissioner, Rettig, as well as Chief Counsel Desmond to advise the Treasury secretary and past Trump business partner, Mnuchin, as to the best legal course to take with regard to the tax return disclosure issue. Yet Mnuchin chose to punt and to rely upon the DOJ for legal advice and ignore that of the best legal experts in the field on the matter.

We can only speculate that the DOJ was brought into this matter in conjunction with the current White House's stonewalling of all written requests and subpoenas from congressional oversight committees. Whatever the reason for the DOJ's entry into the tax disclosure matter, it would appear that the president is being ill served. It is highly likely that an appellate opinion will come down that will mirror that of the draft IRS Counsel opinion in this matter.

A couple of quotes from the IRS draft opinion are dispositive:

“In general, the statutes provide that the Secretary (Treasury) shall furnish returns and return information upon a specific written request from the Chair of the respective Committees... Unlike some other provisions of section 6103, the language in subsection 6103(f)(1) and (2) is mandatory , requiring the Secretary to disclose returns and return information requested from the tax-writing Chairs.”

furnish returns and return information upon a specific written request from the Chair of the respective Committees... Unlike some other provisions of section 6103, the language in subsection 6103(f)(1) and (2) is mandatory requiring the Secretary to disclose returns and return information requested from the tax-writing Chairs.” “Subsection (f)(1) and (2) do not require the Ways and Means and Finance Chair or JCT Chief of Staff to include a reason or purpose for the request. Therefore the Secretary’s obligation to disclose return and return information would not be affected by the failure of a tax-writing committee or the JCT to state a reason for the request.”

It should be noted that Chairman's Neal request did, in fact, include a reference to a need for the House Ways and Means committee to review Presidential audits: ""The Committee is considering legislative proposals and conducting oversight related to our Federal tax laws including but not limited to, the extent to which the IRS audits and enforces the Federal tax laws against a President.""

In a nutshell, what we have here is the Treasury secretary ignoring the advice of his most experienced legal minds with regard to IRS disclosure law and punting the issue to the DOJ and hoping that the creation — some would call a concoction — of an alternate legal issue over the plain-language reading of the IRS disclosure statute will ignite a constitutional issue worthy of a favorable appellate ruling.

Absent that, the only real accomplishment is kicking the can down the political road.

Trump's close brush with Iran: Not the first time a President has pulled back from brink of an attack,https://www.cnn.com,['Analysis Zachary B. Wolf'],06-21-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/21/politics/trump-nixon-presidential-threats/index.html,"(CNN) President Donald Trump said Friday that the US military had been 10 minutes away from a strike that could have killed 150 Iranians when he pulled the plug on the operation.

Bravo, said anyone nervous about the US launching military attacks on Iran, while wondering how Trump got that close to ordering a strike without realizing it would cost human life.

This is not the first time a US President pulled back from the brink of an attack.

Richard Nixon did it in 1969 after North Koreans shot down an unarmed US spy plane. Nixon was not worried about human life, but politics. According to The New York Times report at the time, he was concerned that Americans wouldn't back the move, which bore some similarities to bombings years earlier in the Gulf of Tonkin that presaged war in Vietnam."
"Huawei reportedly sued US Commerce Department over seized equipment, ramping up trade war tensions",https://www.businessinsider.com,['Mark Matousek'],06-22-2019,2019,6,https://www.businessinsider.com/huawei-sues-us-department-of-commerce-over-seized-equipment-2019-6,"The Chinese tech company Huawei filed a lawsuit against the US Department of Commerce on Friday alleging that it has ""unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed agency action"" on unspecified telecommunications equipment that it seized in 2017, Bloomberg reported.

In the lawsuit, Huawei reportedly said that it had sent the equipment to be tested in a California lab in July 2017. The tech giant said the equipment was taken by the US government as it was being returned to China due to uncertainty over whether the equipment required an export license, according to Bloomberg.

Huawei reportedly argued that the equipment didn't need an export license and that it had given the US all of the information it asked for. The company said in the lawsuit that the US has not yet come to a decision on whether the equipment can be returned to China, according to Bloomberg.

Huawei and the Department of Commerce did not immediately respond to Business Insider's requests for comment.

The lawsuit adds another layer to the increasing tension between Huawei and the US government.

In December, Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou was arrested in Canada on charges of violating US trade sanctions against Iran.

The arrest came months before Commerce Department effectively banned American companies from working with Huawei, saying the company's operations posed a threat to US national security and foreign policy, though comments from President Donald Trump and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin have suggested the ban is related to the trade war between the US and China.

The tension seems to be taking its toll on the tech giant, as Huawei has since delayed product releases and cut revenue expectations for this year."
"DHS cancels some Global Entry appointments as summer travel heats up, citing border crush",https://www.cnn.com,['Geneva Sands'],06-20-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/20/politics/global-entry-canceled-appointments-resources-border/index.html,"Washington (CNN) The Department of Homeland Security has had to cancel some Global Entry appointments as the summer travel season heats up as it transfers people to help at the southern border, a department official tells CNN.

Global Entry is a Customs and Border Protection program that ""allows expedited clearance for pre-approved, low-risk travelers upon arrival"" in the US. The Trusted Traveler Programs website , which includes Global Entry, already has an alert warning applicants that the ""extended partial government shutdown has resulted in a backlog,"" of applications and renewals.

The personnel shift comes amid a swell of migrant families and children that have arrived at the US border this year. The influx has strained DHS immigration resources and caused concerns about overcrowding and delayed US Border Patrol processing.

In response to efforts at the border, ""CBP is temporarily reducing staff at Global Entry Enrollment Centers nationwide and reassigning them to support frontline traveler processing during the busy summer months,"" Customs and Border Protection said in a statement.

""Regrettably, this situation has forced the cancellation of some scheduled appointments and may make it difficult to schedule an immediate interview,"" the statement said.

"As EPA heads toward emissions rollback, Americans are driving more",https://www.greencarreports.com,"['Bengt Halvorson', 'Bengt Halvorson - Senior Editor', 'Aaron Cole - Managing Editor']",,,,https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1123740_as-epa-heads-toward-emissions-rollback-americans-are-driving-more,"Policymakers have long pointed to two straightforward paths for cutting carbon emissions: cleaning up the vehicle fleet itself, by making it more efficient (and electrified), and reducing the total number of vehicle miles traveled (VMT).

While the new-vehicle front is affecting serious progress—likely soon slowed by pending changes to federal fuel economy standards—we’re undoing much of that with this continued trend: Americans are driving more.

The latest U.S. Department of Transportation update released last week, which uses data on hand through June 10, 2019, finds that in terms of vehicle miles traveled, Americans drove 2.5 percent more in April 2019, versus April 2018. Even seasonally adjusted—taking into account some larger trends, and adjusting for things like where weekends fall—there’s a 2.0 percent increase.

Traffic was up in all regions of the U.S., with a peak 3.0-percent rise in the West, which includes everything including and west of Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, and New Mexico.

Cumulative travel so far for this year is up, too―at 1.0 percent, to a 2019 running total of 1,020.8 billion miles of travel.

A rise in VMT relates to greenhouse gas emissions and criteria pollutants. It’s also been linked to more highway deaths and various public health issues, as more people spend time in their vehicles.

Overall VMT has been climbing steadily in the U.S. over the past 25 years—with the one exception being a period from 2008 through 2012 (the recession and period immediately following), when miles traveled fell and then flattened for a few years.

Driving is trending higher especially on what the federal government calls Urban Highway environments. To our knowledge there isn’t an existing analysis of why this trend exists, although it could be an indication of people leaving mass transit for car-sharing or ride-hailing options. Or it could be part of a continued trend requiring those with lower-paying jobs in many U.S. big cities to commute from outlying suburbs because of a lack of affordable housing near urban cores.

Update: New York State blocks congestion charge

According to the EPA, the average carbon dioxide emissions from a passenger vehicle in today’s fleet (2017 data) is 404 grams per mile. Model year 2017 vehicles averaged 348 grams per mile across the fleet. Electric vehicles get cleaner each year due to the greening of the grid. According to the Union of Concerned Scientists, the average electric car in the U.S. emits just 129 grams of CO2 per mile.

EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler has said that choosing an electric car is ""not grounds for concerns for the EPA.""

If there’s a bright spot, it’s that that market share of plug-in vehicles—including electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids, which hopefully don’t involve tailpipe pollution in urban driving—rose from 1.16 percent in 2017 to 2.08 percent in 2018 (citing InsideEVs data).

Admittedly, that added up to just 361,000 vehicles nationally. With about 272 million vehicles registered in the U.S. as of 2017, it’s going to take a long time for those vehicles to make up a majority of traffic. If more Americans go electric and think a little bit more about why they’re driving so much, however, those seemingly minor changes could go a long way."
Dominican Republic official pushes back as US State Department hikes number of American tourist deaths to 10,https://wtop.com,['News Traffic Weather'],06-22-2019,2019,6,https://wtop.com/world/2019/06/dominican-republic-official-pushes-back-as-us-state-department-hikes-number-of-american-tourist-deaths-to-10/,"Dominican Republic Tourism Minister Francisco Javier Garcia pushed back on reports of a pattern of suspicious deaths of American citizens Friday, as the U.S. State Department hiked the official number of Americans who have died there in the last year to 10.

(SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic) — Dominican Republic Tourism Minister Francisco Javier Garcia pushed back on reports of a pattern of suspicious deaths of American citizens Friday, as the U.S. State Department hiked the official number of Americans who have died there in the last year to 10.

The tourism minister said the number of Americans who have died in the Dominican Republic has actually decreased this year, and that over the last three years there was a 56% reduction in the number of U.S. tourist deaths in the DR.

On Friday, the U.S. State Department confirmed the death of Mark Hurlbut in the Dominican Republic in June 2018.

State Department officials also recently announced that Thomas Jerome “Jerry” Curran of Bedford, Ohio, died on Jan. 26, 2019, while traveling in the Dominican Republic with his wife, Janet.

Curran, a retired police officer, and Hurlbut join a list of eight other people who have died in the Dominican Republic in the last year, including Yvette Monique Sport, who died in June 2018; David Harrison, who died in July 2018; and Robert Wallace, Miranda Schaupp-Werner, Cynthia Day, Nathaniel Holmes and Joseph Allen, who all died this year.

“To say that an exaggerated number of Americans have died in the Dominican Republic, what some media have characterized as an avalanche of deaths, does not correspond with the reality that we are seeing today in the Dominican Republic,” Garcia said.

No link between the deaths has been established, and U.S. State Department officials say there has been no “uptick” in American deaths in the Caribbean country.

The attorney for Holmes and Day, the couple who was found dead in their Dominican Republic hotel room in May, responded to Garcia’s press conference, saying, “We will let the facts and medical reports tell the story. The family continues to mourn the death of their love ones.”

Dominican authorities have asked for the FBI’s help in conducting toxicology analyses in the investigation into the deaths of Schaupp-Werner, Day and Holmes. Garcia did not release any new information about the cases, including toxicology reports that might shed light on the tourists’ cause of death.

FBI officials have informed Dominican authorities that getting the results of the toxicology analyses could take up to 30 days, and it could be an additional two weeks until the results are released. Garcia said the reports so far have not been shared due to privacy concerns.

Speaking specifically about the case of Holmes and Day, Garcia said that because the Dominican Republic has “nothing to hide,” they asked the FBI to participate and to conduct an additional toxicity report.

Garcia said the Dominican Republic’s tourism industry has been a “model” for the world because of its standards.
