Donald Trump's July 4 spectacle just keeps getting more and more absurd,https://www.cnn.com,"['Analysis Chris Cillizza', 'Cnn Editor-At-Large']",07-02-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/02/politics/donald-trump-july-4/index.html,"(CNN) When President Donald Trump initially announced his plan to take over the usually non-partisan July 4 celebration in Washington way back in February, I wrote a piece with this headline "" The utter absurdity of Trump's July Fourth bash .""

Boy if I had only known!

In each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe!

""Big 4th of July in D.C. 'Salute to America.'"" Trump tweeted on Tuesday morning. ""The Pentagon & our great Military Leaders are thrilled to be doing this & showing to the American people, among other things, the strongest and most advanced Military anywhere in the World. Incredible Flyovers & biggest ever Fireworks!""

With the festivities now only days away, the full picture of what Trump has planned is coming into focus. And boy, oh boy, is it over the top. Among the plans:

* There will be tanks (M1 Abrams) other armored vehicles. ""You've got to be pretty careful with the tanks because the roads have a tendency not to like to carry heavy tanks so we have to put them in certain areas but we have the brand new Sherman tanks and we have the brand new Abrams tanks,"" Trump said on Monday. ( Sherman tanks haven't been produced since 195 7 .)

* There will be a flyover by the plane that is Air Force One. (It is only technically called ""Air Force One"" when the President is on board, which he won't be.) The Navy's ""Blue Angels"" will also be performing a flyover.

* There will a ground stop at Washington Reagan National Airport from 6:15 p.m. to 7:45 p.m. and then again from 9 p.m. to 9:45 p.m. to accommodate the flyovers and fireworks, according to the Federal Aviation Administration.

* Trump will deliver a speech from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial.

The argument for this sort of over-the-top display with an exorbitant but indeterminate (as of yet) cost is simple: America is great. July 4 is when we celebrate our breaking free from British oppression. Why wouldn't we make a big to-do over it?

""Do you know the Fourth of July is a celebration of this country's independence, are you aware of that?"" White House senior counselor Kellyanne Conway asked a reporter on Tuesday morning in response to his question about the planned celebration. When the reporter replied in the affirmative, Conway said this: ""You are? You know what happened July 4, 1776? OK. Because it doesn't sound like you're even talking about the patriotism that undergirds it.""

The dynamic, as Conway and the White House see it, is simple: If you are questioning why Trump is using July 4 to put on a show of military might, you simply don't either understand what it means to be an American or you don't love your country properly.

Which is, uh, well, problematic.

There's a reason that no president before Trump has turned July 4 into, well, what Trump is turning it into. And that reason isn't that they didn't love America enough or understand what makes this country great.

Instead, they understood that there is a very fine line between patriotism and nationalism. (FWIW: Patriotism is, according to Merriam Webster , a ""love for or devotion to one's country."" Nationalism is a ""sense of national consciousness exalting one nation above all others and placing primary emphasis on promotion of its culture and interests as opposed to those of other nations or supranational groups."")

Everyone draws that line differently. But I return to the fact that lots of past presidents -- Republicans and Democrats -- have had the chance to do something like Trump is planning on July 4 and taken a pass, choosing instead to keep the day entirely devoid of any sort of political statement. Was that unpatriotic? Or was it a recognition that putting tanks and other military equipment in and around Washington, DC sends the wrong sort of message to both our allies and our enemies?

The parading of military has long been the stuff of dictators and authoritarian regimes -- from Iran to North Korea to Russia. The leaders -- military and civilian -- in the United States have avoided that sort of thing because, well, the strongest guy in the gym doesn't need to go around telling everyone how strong he is. It's understood. Yes, we have massive military might. But we also believe in diplomacy, avoiding military conflicts at all costs and using force as only a last resort.

Trump doesn't seem to grasp that nuance. Or he grasps it and either doesn't care or doesn't agree.

Either way, the images coming out of Washington, DC, on Thursday night will send a very different message to the country and the world than ever before on July 4. Trump knows that -- and is thrilled about it. I'm not so sure the rest of us should be."
This is ALWAYS how the fight for Donald Trump's tax returns was going to end,https://www.cnn.com,"['Analysis Chris Cillizza', 'Cnn Editor-At-Large']",07-02-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/02/politics/donald-trump-tax-returns-congress-sue/index.html,"""Despite its mandatory obligation, the Treasury Department failed to comply with the law and denied the Committee's request,"" said House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal, D-Mass., in announcing the move. ""The Administration also refused to comply with the subpoenas I subsequently issued in an effort to obtain the materials. Due to that noncompliance, the Committee is now pursuing this matter in the federal courts.""

The decision to sue comes a full three months after Neal first requested Trump's tax returns from Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, citing an IRS statute that states that the treasury secretary ""shall"" turn over the tax return of any American if the chair of the House Ways and Means Committee requests it. In his initial request, Neil asked for personal tax returns from 2013 to 2018 as well as returns for eight business entities affiliated with Trump.

Mnuchin denied that request, insisting that Neal didn't have any credible reason to ask for Trump's returns -- other than to score political points. And that decision led us to today.

In truth, everything from April 3 (when Neal first requested Trump's returns) until today has been predictable prelude.

There is -- and was -- a 0% chance that Trump (or his proxy Mnuchin) was ever going to voluntarily turn over the President's tax returns. Why? Because, at some point in the relatively early days of the 2016 campaign, Trump and his advisers made the decision that whatever was in his returns would be far more damaging to his chances of being president than the bad press he would get by not releasing them. (Trump is the first major-party presidential nominee to release no tax returns and the first US president since Watergate to refuse to release any returns.)

That initial decision has been justified in all sorts of different ways by Trump and his top aides.

The longest-running excuse -- er -- explanation is that Trump is currently under audit and that you don't release your returns while under audit.

""You don't learn anything from a tax return,"" Trump said at a GOP debate in February 2016. ""I will say this. Mitt Romney looked like a fool when he delayed and delayed and delayed and Harry Reid baited him and Mitt Romney didn't file until a month and a half before the election and it cost him bigly. ... As far as my return, I want to file it except for many years, I've been audited every year. Twelve years or something like that. Every year they audit me, audit me, audit me. ... I will absolutely give my return but I'm being audited now for two or three [years' worth] now so I can't.""

He's repeated that same basic line for years now -- although it's not, strictly speaking, accurate. There is no law that bars Trump from releasing his returns. In fact, there is precedent for a president -- say that 10 times fast! -- to do so. Seeking to knock down the idea that he was a crook, Richard Nixon released his tax returns , while in office, in 1973. So it's not that Trump can't release his returns under audit. It's that he doesn't want to.

The other main reason offered by Trump's allies for his refusal to turn over his returns is that no one cares to see them. The most outspoken advocate of this position is White House counselor Kellyanne Conway. ""We litigated this all through the election. People didn't care,"" she said way back in early 2017 . ""They voted for him, and let me make this very clear: Most Americans are very focused on what their tax returns will look like while President Trump is in office, not what his look like.""

That is, also, not strictly accurate. There's no way of Conway knowing whether people voting for Trump did so knowing (and not caring) that he hadn't released his tax returns because there was no question on the 2016 exit poll that remotely dealt with that issue. And subsequent polling suggests the opposite is true: In a late April CNN-SSRS national poll, 66% of respondents said Trump should release his taxes publicly, while 32% said he should not.

The point here is that -- whatever the reason Trump and his supporters offered in the moment -- this was always the endgame. Refuse to cooperate at all turns. Force the issue into the courts. Hope for a favorable ruling but, short of that, root for a drawn-out process whereby any sort of ruling isn't offered until either a) Trump has already secured a second term or b) Trump has lost reelection and the state of his tax returns is no longer of such interest.

We've been heading in this direction for the past four years. Now the real fight -- the legal one -- begins. Trump hopes it won't end anytime soon."
"Trump Administration Hits Some Immigrants In U.S. Illegally With Fines Up To $500,000",https://www.npr.org,['Franco Ordoñez'],07-02-2019,2019,7,https://www.npr.org/2019/07/02/738059913/trump-administration-sends-out-notices-of-500-000-fines-for-those-in-u-s-illegal,"Trump Administration Hits Some Immigrants In U.S. Illegally With Fines Up To $500,000

Enlarge this image toggle caption Emilio Espejel/AP Emilio Espejel/AP

The Trump administration is seeking to fine some immigrants, who are in the United States illegally, hundreds of thousands of dollars for failing to take steps to leave after being ordered to do so, according to government documents obtained by NPR.

The Department of Homeland Security sent out a batch of notices across the country to targeted individuals ordering them to pay fines of up to nearly $500,000 for ""failing to depart the U.S. as previously agreed,"" among other factors.

It's the latest hard-line effort by the administration as it clamps down on illegal immigration at the border and increases interior enforcement.

""It is the intention of ICE to order you pay a fine in the amount of $497,777,"" Lisa Hoechst, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer, wrote to Edith Espinal Moreno in a letter dated June 25, 2019, obtained by NPR from lawyers for Moreno.

The letters come as the Trump administration prepares to carry out delayed immigration sweeps of migrant families who have received deportation orders. President Trump said Monday, while signing legislation providing $4.6 billion in funding to address the influx of migrants from Central America, that the immigration raids will begin after the July 4 holiday if Congress can't pass new restrictions on asylum laws.

At the beginning of his term, Trump signed an executive order promising, ""as soon as practicable, and by no later than one year after the date of this order,"" that the administration would begin collection of ""all fines and penalties that the Secretary is authorized under the law to assess and collect from aliens unlawfully present in the United States.""

ICE said the Immigration and Nationality Act grants the agency the right to impose ""civil fines on aliens who have been ordered removed or granted voluntary departure and fail to depart the United States.""

It states fines of no more than $500 for each day the person is in violation of this section. But immigration lawyers say they've never heard of it used in this manner.

An ICE official said undocumented immigrants who willfully refuse to meet the obligations of an order issued by the Justice Department's Executive Office for Immigration Review may receive a ""Notice of Intention to Fine"" and then are subsequently provided a 30-day period to respond before a formal decision whether to issue a fine is made.

ICE officials said the agency began issuing these notices in December 2018 on a case-by-case basis, taking into account steps the individual has taken to fulfill the court's orders.

""ICE is committed to using various enforcement methods — including arrest, detention, technological monitoring and financial penalties — to enforce U.S. immigration law and maintain the integrity of legal orders issued by judges,"" ICE spokesman Matthew Bourke told NPR.

Pro-immigrant advocates argue the Trump administration is trying to instill fear and confusion in immigrant communities, expecting the immigrants will leave. They report similar letters being received by immigrants in similar situations in North Carolina, Utah, Virginia and Texas.

Espinal, 42, said she could not believe the U.S. government thought she would have almost half a million dollars. She has been living in sanctuary at an Ohio church since an immigration judge ordered her removed two years ago. The church, its congregation and the community have largely supported her and her family.

""They want to scare me,"" Espinal said, adding, ""because they know I am in sanctuary. And they know I don't have this amount of money.""

Espinal said she came to the United States from Mexico with her father when she was 16. She now has three children of her own, including two who are U.S. citizens. She said her whole life is in the United States and she cannot return to Mexico.

Leon Fresco, who served as deputy assistant attorney general for the Office of Immigration Litigation in the Obama administration, said he could not recall a time when such high fines were used during the previous administration.

""It's a vivid illustration of the lengths the Trump administration will go to use any available authority to try to enforce immigration law,"" Fresco said. ""I have not seen a $300,000 fine for failing to facilitate one's own removal.""

Espinal's attorney, Lizbeth Mateo, said she started laughing when she first saw the letter. She fears the administration is laying the groundwork for criminal penalties and could use fees in other ways to increase pressure on immigrants to leave.

""It's almost half a million dollars. Are they for real? Do they really think that she's going to pay this?"" Mateo said. ""I laughed, because there has to be someone in some basement in D.C. thinking, 'Oh, what else can I do to mess with immigrants? What else can I do to hurt them?' ""

DC airport to halt flights during Trump Fourth of July event,https://www.cnn.com,['Gregory Wallace'],07-02-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/02/politics/dca-july-4-runway-closure/index.html,"(CNN) Runways at the busy airport serving the nation's capital will be closed Thursday during President Donald Trump's Independence Day event, federal authorities said.

The Federal Aviation Administration announced Tuesday that operations at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport would be suspended between 6:15 p.m. and 7:45 p.m. ET to allow a ceremonial flyover of military aircraft

The runways will also be closed from 9 p.m. to 9:45 p.m. ET for the annual fireworks display, which is not connected to Trump's ""Salute to America.""

Such a closure is unprecedented for July 4 events, an official said. The launch point for the fireworks has been moved from the National Mall to a nearby park to accommodate Trump's Lincoln Memorial display.

The last such runway closure was in 2015 for a commemorative flight of World War II-era planes.

DOJ says citizenship question being dropped from 2020 Census: NY attorney general's office,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/doj-says-citizenship-question-being-dropped-from-2020-census-ny-attorney-generals-office,"The New York attorney general’s office said Tuesday the Justice Department has decided to print the 2020 Census without the citizenship question sought by the Trump administration, ending a contentious legal dispute over an issue that could soon affect the makeup of Congress and the Electoral College.

The Supreme Court ruled last week that the question couldn't be added for now, but left open the possibility that additional arguments could change its mind. Civil rights groups argued that the Trump administration's reasons for including the question were merely pretextual efforts to discourage illegal immigrants from responding to the Census.

Population counts from the Census are used to apportion House seats among the 50 states, and a new electoral map based on the Census will be in effect for the 2024 presidential election. States receive votes in the Electoral College equal to the number of members in their congressional delegation, counting both House and Senate seats.

In a tweet on Monday, Daniel Jacobson, who worked in the White House Counsel’s Office under President Obama, said a trial attorney at the Justice Department told him that ""the printer has been instructed to begin the printing process"" without the citizenship question.

""We won,"" Jacobson wrote.

In a statement to Fox News, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross tied the decision to the Supreme Court's ruling.

“I respect the Supreme Court but strongly disagree with its ruling regarding my decision to reinstate a citizenship question on the 2020 Census,"" Ross said. ""The Census Bureau has started the process of printing the decennial questionnaires without the question. My focus, and that of the Bureau and the entire Department is to conduct a complete and accurate census.”

For his part, House Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings, D-Md., issued a less-than-celebratory statement calling for answers, even as he praised the decision to scrap the citizenship question.

""I am encouraged that Administration officials dropped President Trump’s unconstitutional plan to postpone the Census just because he lost the Supreme Court case,"" Cummings said. ""The Trump Administration put our country through more than a year of wasted time and squandered resources—all in the service of an illegal attempt to add a discriminatory question based on a pretext.""

Cummings continued: ""The Attorney General and the Secretary of Commerce must now turn over all of the documents our Committee has subpoenaed on a bipartisan basis.""

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y, added, ""The exclusion of the citizenship question from the census is a victory for our democracy and for fair representation of all communities in this country.""

President Trump had tweeted that he had asked lawyers if the count can be delayed until the Supreme Court can reevaluate the matter, based on additional evidence supporting the administration's justifications for adding the citizenship question.

The Supreme Court, in its ruling last week, did not prohibit a citizenship question out of hand but dismissed the administration's provided rationale as insufficient.

However, Kristen Clarke, president and executive director of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, told Fox News on Tuesday that the Supreme Court was unlikely to change its mind. Clarke's team successfully challenged the Trump administration on the use of the citizenship question in federal court in California, and was one of several groups to bring such lawsuits.

“The Supreme Court’s ruling left little opportunity for the administration to cure the defects with its decision to add a citizenship question and, most importantly, they were simply out of time given the impending deadline for printing forms,"" Clarke said.

Experts agreed that any delay could gum up the U.S. Census Bureau's finely calibrated timetable for the 10-year count. Monday was the deadline to start printing the 600 million documents that will be mailed to 130 million households for next April's census count.

CAL THOMAS: CENSORING THE CENSUS IS ABOUT POLITICS, NOT THE LAW

For months, the Trump administration had argued that the courts needed to decide quickly whether the citizenship question could be added to the 2020 census because of the looming deadline.

""I think it's very important to find out if somebody is a citizen as opposed to an illegal,"" Trump told reporters Monday. ""There's a big difference to me between being a citizen of the United States and being an illegal.""

Former President Barack Obama's administration didn't ask the citizenship question in the 2010 census. The citizenship question was last asked on the census in 1950, but beginning in 1970, a citizenship question was asked in a long-form questionnaire sent to a relatively small number of households, alongside the main census. In 2010, there was no long-form questionnaire.

""There is no credible argument to be made that asking about citizenship subverts the Constitution and federal law,"" Chapman University law professor and constitutional law expert John Eastman told Fox News.

From a logistical standpoint, any delay ""would be a nightmare,"" said John Thompson, who served as Census Bureau director during Obama's second term.

The bureau already has been in the process of signing almost 250 office leases across the U.S. and has hired 1,500 specialists partnering with community organizations to encourage people to participate in the census. More than 170,000 recruits already have filled out applications for the almost half-million positions being created for the count. The bureau has helped set up more than 1,500 committees nationwide working to get everyone to respond.

Furthermore, Congress would have to change the law for the count to be delayed because Title 13 of the U.S. Code mandates that it take place on April 1, 2020, Thompson said.

""I don't think there's any ambiguity, but I'm not a lawyer,"" Thompson said.

Fewer people are expected to fill out the questionnaires using paper than in years past because the bureau for the first time is relying on most respondents to use the Internet to answer questions. Still, printed postcards and letters are to be sent out next March reminding residents it's time to answer the questionnaire, and those who don't respond digitally are expected to be mailed paper questionnaires.

As recently as last week, the Trump administration's solicitor general wrote in court papers that the Census Bureau needed to finalize the questions by June. Any changes to the paper questionnaire after June would impair the bureau's ability to conduct the count in a timely manner, wrote the solicitor general, Noel Francisco.

More than two dozen Democrats in the U.S. Senate last week sent a letter urging Ross to drop any further pursuit of the citizenship question because it would delay the bureau's ability to conduct the count.

""The 2020 Census is less than half a year away, and any unnecessary delay in operations would impact the ability of the Census Bureau to count every person in our country,"" the letter read.

This past May, Montana Republican Sen. Steve Daines introduced legislation that would require the census to include a citizenship question.

""This is America,"" Daines told Fox News at the time. ""We are a sovereign nation. It's absurd that we don't know how many citizens and non-citizens are living in this country. That's why I'm introducing this bill to require a citizenship question on the census - and ensure that states harboring millions of illegal immigrants are not rewarded with additional taxpayer dollars.""

House Democrats file lawsuit to obtain Trump tax returns,https://www.cnn.com,"['Lauren Fox', 'Katelyn Polantz', 'Clare Foran', 'Ellie Kaufman']",07-02-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/02/politics/tax-return-lawsuit/index.html,"(CNN) The Democrat-led House Ways and Means Committee filed a lawsuit on Tuesday to enforce subpoenas and obtain President Donald Trump's tax returns, an escalation in a fight for the President's personal financial information.

The lawsuit was filed in D.C. District Court against Treasury and the IRS and their respective leaders, Steve Mnuchin and Charles Rettig.

House Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal is seeking the President's tax returns using a little-known IRS provision known as 6103 , which allows the Chairmen of the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee to request and obtain an individual's tax information for a legitimate legislative purpose.

The move comes months after Neal made his initial request for the President's tax information and as outside groups and other liberals on the Ways and Means Committee grew impatient with the pace of Neal's efforts. Neal initially made his request for Trump's tax returns on April 3. After a series of follow-up letters, the Treasury Department formally denied the request at the beginning of May, and Neal issued subpoenas to the IRS and Treasury Department on May 10.

""In refusing to comply with the statute, Defendants have mounted an extraordinary attack on the authority of Congress to obtain information needed to conduct oversight of Treasury, the IRS, and the tax laws on behalf of the American people who participate in the Nation's voluntary tax system,"" House attorneys wrote in the complaint.

Federal Inspectors Release Photos to Blast DHS for ‘Dangerous’ Overcrowding at Border Facilities,https://www.thedailybeast.com,"['Scott Bixby', 'National Reporter']",07-02-2019,2019,7,https://www.thedailybeast.com/shocking-new-photos-hundreds-of-migrants-crammed-into-border-facility,"A Republican congressman dismissed a constituent’s concerns about the migrant detention crisis during a heated town hall meeting over the weekend, telling her that children being held in squalid conditions in U.S. Customs and Border Protection facilities are free to leave whenever they want.

“The people that are there, they can leave,” said Rep. Jim Hagedorn (R-MN), a first-term congressman. “Nobody is holding them against their will—they can leave.”

The remark, which is factually incorrect, was made in response to an impassioned question from a female constituent who said she was “very concerned about family separation at the border,” which she feared was “causing emotional damage” for the thousands of migrant children currently in the custody of U.S. immigration enforcement.

“It’s not ‘government-sponsored child abuse,’” Hagedorn said in response to the question, prompting boos and hisses from the audience at Rochester Community and Technical College on June 28. “These are not concentration camps—no, they’re not.”

Unlike concentration camps in Nazi Germany, Hagedorn elaborated, those in ICE and Border Patrol custody “can leave.”

In most cases, children and adults alike cannot leave immigration detention centers or Border Patrol holding facilities unless they are eligible for—and can pay—bond while their removal proceedings wind through immigration court. Increasingly indiscriminate enforcement by U.S. immigration authorities, a steadily increasing number of migrants seeking refuge and asylum due to political instability in Central America, and a massive backlog in the immigration court system have all contributed to massive overcrowding in detention centers and Border Patrol stations along the U.S.-Mexico border, to the point that children are often being held in such facilities far longer than allowed by federal law.

On Tuesday afternoon, the Department of Homeland Security’s Office of the Inspector General illustrated the dire conditions in such facilities with the release of a report warning that inspections of Border Patrol facilities along the U.S. southern border have revealed “serious overcrowding and prolonged detention” of unaccompanied migrant children.

The “dangerous overcrowding,” the OIG wrote, requires “immediate attention”—as do the conditions in the facilities, where children have been held for days without access to showers, laundry facilities, and functioning toilets.

“While all facilities had infant formula, diapers, baby wipes, and juice and snacks for children, we observed that two facilities had not provided children access to hot meals… until the week we arrived,” the OIG report states. Some detainees had become so constipated on a diet composed solely of bologna sandwiches that they required medical attention.

According to the report, nearly half of detainees held at facilities inspected by the OIG had been held longer than the 72 hours permitted under Border Patrol’s standards, with nearly half of those having been held for more than 10 days.

Hagedorn attempted to sidestep the issue of child detention, as well as the conditions in the facilities, telling the audience in Rochester that he favored an “orderly, systemic process” for removal and deportation of undocumented immigrants from the United States. He then asked the woman who posed the question whether she thought there should be limits on entry into the United States.

The woman responded that she was more concerned about “little children that are being held against their will, against their will, on their own, without their parents.”

“They cannot get up leave anytime they want!” the woman said angrily. “How is a three-month-old baby, or a four-year-old, gonna leave a facility like that?”

“Fair enough,” Hagedorn responded."

How many migrants show up for immigration court hearings?,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Salvador Rizzo', 'Reporter For The Fact Checker']",06-26-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/06/26/how-many-migrants-show-up-immigration-court-hearings/,"“The vast majority never show up for their hearing, you know, a year, 18 months, down the road.”

— Vice President Pence, in an interview on CBS’s “Face the Nation,” June 23, 2019

Pence: “What we want: To end the days where people believe they can come into the country, make a claim of asylum from oppression or deprivation or violence in Central America or elsewhere, and then be released into the country on their own recognizance only to vanish into the nation.”

Jake Tapper, CNN: “Well, most of them do show up to their hearings.”

Pence: “Ninety percent of the people never show up for their hearing in the months ahead. ... The overwhelming majority, plus-90 percent, don’t show up.”

— Exchange on CNN’s “State of the Union,” June 23, 2019

As the Trump administration calls for tighter immigration laws, officials from the president on down claim almost all migrants are gaming the system because they fail to show up for court.

The nation’s nearly 400 immigration judges are under a mountain of backlogged cases, and hundreds of thousands of Central Americans continue to arrive at the border each year. Because of a lack of holding capacity and a court settlement requiring the release of children, U.S. immigration authorities allow many migrant families into the country while they wait for hearings.

On CBS, Pence claimed that “the vast majority” never show up. On CNN, he said the rate of no-shows was “plus-90 percent.”

The rate of no-shows is far below 90 percent, according to the Department of Justice’s most recent annual figures. When using the Justice Department’s preferred metric, 44 percent of migrants who were not in custody failed to show up for their court proceedings.

That’s half the rate Pence claimed. And some researchers say that the Justice Department numbers don’t tell the whole story and that the real rate is less than 44 percent.

The Facts

A migrant either attends a court hearing or doesn’t attend. It’s a yes-or-no question that lends itself to simple math. Yet the numbers vary widely.

Because immigration court records are secret, the government’s statistics are difficult to verify. Some of them measure a subset of immigration cases and tell one story. Some numbers crunched by researchers tell another story. The picture can be blurry because an immigration case may involve several hearings over more than one year.

We reviewed statistics from the Justice Department (which runs the immigration courts), the Department of Homeland Security (which oversees the border) and independent researchers analyzing court records.

The Justice Department reports no-show statistics based on “initial case completions,” a metric that doesn’t count some migrants who show up for court but have their cases postponed or who don’t get a resolution. Completed cases sometimes are reopened and result in different outcomes.

Pence’s claim distorts what acting Homeland Security secretary Kevin McAleenan told the Senate Judiciary Committee in a June 11 hearing. The panel chairman, Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), asked “what percentage of the people show up for the asylum hearing?”

“So, it depends on the demographic, the court, but we do see too many cases where people are not showing up,” McAleenan said. “We did an expedited pilot with family units this year with ICE [U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement] and the immigration courts. Out of those 7,000 cases, 90 [percent] received final orders of removal in absentia, 90 percent.”

He added, “That is a recent sample from families crossing the border.”

Notice how McAleenan framed his answer. The 90 percent rate he gave was based on a sample of 7,000 cases being fast-tracked through the immigration courts, not all cases.

A representative for Pence told us he “was referring to a pilot program launched under DHS,” the same one McAleenan brought up to the Senate Judiciary Committee.

But Pence did not hedge his comments as McAleenan did and instead indicated that 90 percent of all migrants never show up for court. When CNN anchor Jake Tapper challenged him, Pence dug in. “The overwhelming majority, plus-90 percent, don’t show up,” he said.

Graham’s question was about asylum hearings, not about all immigration cases. From fiscal 2013 through 2017, asylum applicants received deportation orders “in absentia” in 6 percent to 11 percent of cases per year, according to the most recent statistics yearbook from the Justice Department’s Executive Office for Immigration Review. The term “in absentia” is used when someone didn’t show up to court.

Let’s take a look at the different statistics measuring court appearance rates for migrants.

McAleenan

In September, the Justice Department began to prioritize immigration cases for family units “with the goal of completing these cases within a year of initiation,” a DHS official told us. This fast-track initiative is sometimes called the “rocket docket.”

“As of April 2019, out of approximately 7,700 total removal orders for rocket docket cases, over 6,700 were in absentia,” the DHS official told us. That’s 87 percent.

When Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) challenged these numbers at the June 11 hearing, McAleenan said, “I gave you the recent numbers of over 7,000 families that we put through a process to try to get court results more quickly: 90 percent of them did not show up for their hearings.”

McAleenan didn’t claim that this no-show rate of 90 percent applies broadly to all migrants. He was talking strictly about the rocket docket.

These figures come from the Justice Department, which reports court appearance rates on the basis of initial case completions, as we’ve noted. That measure will not count migrants who show up for court but whose hearings are postponed or whose cases remain pending.

“Early numbers from a ‘rocket docket’ is a really horrible place to get in absentia rates, since those who are fighting their cases have not had sufficient time to be resolved and rocket dockets tend to cause more in absentia orders,” Sarah Pierce, an analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, wrote in an email.

“Since the docket is brand-new, pretty much the only cases which had ended [as of April] were the ones where the person missed court, so that number ignored the huge number of pending cases where the family had appeared but the case was ongoing,” Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, an analyst at the American Immigration Council, wrote in an email.

“As we’ve seen, many migrants who claim asylum and are permitted into the U.S. often disappear before a judge decides the case in court,” the DHS official said. “This act directly undermines legal immigration procedures. We have and continue to take unprecedented action to ensure the integrity of the immigration process.”

Justice Department

The Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) publishes yearly statistics detailing the number of migrants who were issued deportation orders after failing to show up for court. These numbers are based on initial case completions. Pierce said “these rates only count final decisions, not pending cases in which people are attending their hearings.”

“I usually try to use older FYs [fiscal years] to talk about in absentia rates, because for the older numbers there’s been more time for the slower-moving cases in which people are attending to resolve,” she added.

The EOIR statistics include four categories: “never detained,” “released,” “unaccompanied alien children” and “asylum.” They also include a total for all cases.



(Executive Office for Immigration Review/Department of Justice)

Judges ordered in absentia removals in 14 percent of all cases in fiscal 2013, a rate that grew to 28 percent in fiscal 2017.

An EOIR fact sheet from May highlights that 44 percent of non-detained migrants were ordered out of the country after missing their court dates. That means 56 percent, a majority, did show up.

When we previously asked EOIR about this, a spokeswoman for the office told us the asylum category includes some migrants who are in custody and thus are unable to skip their court dates.

Focusing on migrants who aren’t detained is a reasonable way to assess the data when trying to determine how many skip their hearings, though we note that the asylum category includes a mix of people who are both detained or released (there’s no breakdown in the EOIR yearbook).

The Justice Department for this fact-check highlighted other data points. Spokesman Alexei Woltornist said “only 13 out of every 100 credible fear claims are granted asylum” and sent us this flow chart. (That’s notable, but asylum grant rates don’t indicate how many migrants attend their court hearings.)

Back to the rocket docket. It’s a pilot program in 10 cities. Woltornist said the rate of in absentia deportation orders for family units had decreased to 82 percent as of June 14. An EOIR table shows that 56,286 cases had been opened on the rocket docket, 13,313 of them had been initially completed, and judges had issued 10,877 in absentia removal orders. (A footnote says that EOIR relies on DHS officials to identify family units and that these numbers don’t include all the families currently in immigration court proceedings nationwide.)

TRAC

Researchers at the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC) at Syracuse University in a June 18 report found that 81 percent of migrant families attended all their court hearings, measuring from September through May.

“Thus, court records directly contradict the widely quoted claim that ’90 Percent of Recent Asylum Seekers Skipped Their Hearings,’” the report says, linking to an article about McAleenan’s testimony on June 11.

How is it possible that 81 percent of families attend all their hearings, when the Justice Department says the attendance rates are much lower? (And not just the Justice Department — an older data set from TRAC covering 2014 to 2018 shows that 49 percent of families attended their hearings.)

Susan B. Long, the co-director of TRAC and a managerial statistics professor at Syracuse University, said the difference is in counting all ongoing cases instead of only completed cases. “We didn’t remove anything,” she said. “It’s exactly how the data is recorded.”

Of 46,743 families, 85.5 percent attended their initial hearing and 81 percent attended all their hearings, according to TRAC. “Most have had only one scheduled hearing,” Long said. For those families with legal representation, the attendance rate was 99.9 percent at the first hearing and 99 percent for all hearings, the TRAC report says.

Woltornist, the Justice Department spokesman, said, “I don’t know exactly where they got the numbers.” The TRAC report says researchers obtained records from the nation’s immigration courts by filing requests to EOIR under the Freedom of Information Act.

The Pinocchio Test

This game of telephone went badly awry.

McAleenan gave flawed statistics in response to Graham’s question. They were not about asylum hearings and they covered only those families with cases on the rocket docket. That’s a pilot program in 10 cities, so it doesn’t represent what’s happening nationwide.

The numbers McAleenan gave ran from September to April. A small share of the rocket docket cases had been completed in that period. Because of the way the Justice Department reports court appearance rates for migrants — based on completed cases — the numbers from McAleenan presented an inflated picture of how many skip their hearings. In absentia cases are closed right away; ongoing cases in which families initially show up for court are not factored into the statistics.

But this is a fact-check of the vice president, who went on national television and claimed “plus-90 percent” of migrants skip their court hearings. It’s a Four Pinocchio claim relying only on the Justice Department’s figures.

We noted flaws in McAleenan’s numbers, but he disclosed that he was talking about a pilot program limited to 7,000 cases. Pence did not make the same distinction on CBS or CNN. He spoke in terms of all immigration cases nationwide.

The Justice Department’s preferred metric shows that 44 percent of migrants who are not in custody miss their court hearings. That’s half the rate Pence claimed.

TRAC’s analysis shows that when counting court appearances instead of completed cases, and when counting all family units instead of only those on the rocket docket, the vast majority of migrant families attended their hearings from September through May.

‘A Constant Game of Musical Chairs’ Amid Another Homeland Security Shake-Up,https://www.nytimes.com,"['Zolan Kanno-Youngs', 'Maggie Haberman']",06-25-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/25/us/politics/mark-morgan-ice-cbp.html,"In an interview on Tuesday for a coming book about the president’s immigration policies, Mr. Trump acknowledged the tumult among his top immigration officials.

“I do burn out on people, I do. If somebody’s not really great, I do,” the president said during the interview in the Oval Office. He did not directly address the turnover at Customs and Border Protection, but said he had made “good changes” in the people who run his immigration agencies.

“I understand what I want,” he said. “And we’re starting to get there.”

The White House directed Kevin McAleenan, the acting secretary of homeland security, to replace Mr. Sanders with Mr. Morgan after multiple White House officials expressed displeasure that Mr. Sanders was not being aggressive enough at the southwestern border, administration officials said. Mr. McAleenan complied, hoping to diminish friction with the White House, officials said.

Mr. McAleenan resisted an earlier push by Stephen Miller, the architect behind Mr. Trump’s immigration policy, to appoint Mr. Morgan as the head of Customs and Border Protection, according to current and former homeland security officials.

In 2017, shortly after he took office, Mr. Trump forced out Mr. Morgan as Border Patrol chief. But Mr. Morgan won the approval of the White House after backing the president’s aggressive policies on television. In one appearance on Fox News, Mr. Morgan said that when he looked into the eyes of detained migrant children, he saw a “soon-to-be MS-13 gang member.”

In a letter to Customs and Border Protection employees on Tuesday, Mr. Sanders confirmed his departure.

“Although I will leave it to you to determine whether I was successful,” Mr. Sanders, a former chief technology officer at the Transportation Security Administration who helped spearhead the agency’s PreCheck program, wrote, “I can unequivocally say that helping support the amazing men and women of C.B.P. has been the most fulfilling and satisfying opportunity of my career.”"
Judge rules Democrats’ emoluments lawsuit against Trump can proceed,https://www.marketwatch.com,['Associated Press'],06-25-2019,2019,6,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/judge-rules-democrats-emoluments-lawsuit-against-trump-can-proceed-2019-06-25,"WASHINGTON — A federal judge ruled Tuesday that a lawsuit that accuses President Donald Trump of profiting off the presidency in violation of the Constitution’s emoluments clause can move forward.

U.S. District Judge Emmett G. Sullivan of the District of Columbia ruled against Justice Department lawyers who sought a mid-case appeal to a higher court and a stay on proceedings in the meantime.

The case brought by nearly 200 congressional Democrats argues that Trump has been accepting gifts from foreign governments without congressional approval. Trump, unlike modern presidents before him, has declined to fully divest from his businesses.

The lawmakers say Trump’s unwillingness to ask permission is akin to denying lawmakers the right to do their jobs.

The judge’s decision clears the way for the lawmakers to begin issuing subpoenas for information as early as Friday.

Tuesday’s ruling came as Trump was heading to a roundtable event and fundraiser with supporters at his namesake hotel in Washington, just steps from the White House.

“This case should have been dismissed,” said Justice Department spokeswoman Kelly Laco. “It presents important questions that warrant immediate appellate review and is another impractical attempt to disrupt and distract the President from his official duties. The Department of Justice will appeal the court’s decision.”

The Trump Organization did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi welcomed the ruling. As the Trump administration largely stonewalls congressional investigations, House Democrats have increasingly turned to the courts for relief. It’s the latest of several recent court rulings in their favor.

“No one is above the law — not even the president,” Pelosi said in a statement. “Once again, the courts have resoundingly reaffirmed our efforts to hold the President accountable for corruption, and ensure that the President acts in the public interest, not his own interest.”

One of the lead lawmakers in the suit, Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., tweeted, “This tremendous victory assures that President Trump will be held accountable to the Constitution & the American people — a historic triumph for legally mandated transparency.”

The case argues that the president has received foreign government favors, such as Chinese government trademarks for his companies, payments for hotel room stays and event-space rentals by representatives of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, and proceeds from Chinese or Emirati-linked government purchases of office space in Trump Tower.

Ethics experts say the Revolutionary War-era Emolument Clause was written into the U.S. Constitution to ensure that government officials act with the interests of the American public in mind instead of their own pocketbooks.

Unlike prior presidents, Trump chose not to divest from his assets and he remains the owner of the Trump Organization, a sprawling business empire with 550 entities in more than 20 countries that include branded hotels, golf courses, licensing deals and other interests. His Washington, D.C., hotel is near the White House and has become a magnet for foreign governments, previously hosting groups tied to Kuwait, Bahrain, Turkey, Malaysia and Saudi Arabia."
Judge Rejects Government’s Request to Halt Emoluments Suit Against Trump,https://www.nytimes.com,['Sharon Lafraniere'],06-25-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/25/us/politics/trump-emoluments-lawsuit.html,"WASHINGTON — A federal judge refused on Tuesday to halt a lawsuit by congressional Democrats alleging that President Trump has illegally profited from his business while in office, and ordered evidence gathering to begin on Friday.

The Justice Department said it would appeal the ruling by Judge Emmet G. Sullivan of United States District Court for the District of Columbia. Many legal experts predict that the extraordinary contest over whether Mr. Trump has violated the so-called emoluments clauses of the Constitution will eventually reach the Supreme Court.

The president’s lawyers had asked Judge Sullivan to delay the lawsuit, which was filed by nearly 200 congressional Democrats, while they appealed his earlier rulings to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. But in a 12-page opinion, Judge Sullivan said the president had failed to meet the high standard required to put aside the usual procedure of appealing a judicial decision at the end of a case."
Mueller to Testify on Russia Probe Before Congress,https://www.thedailybeast.com,"['Erin Banco', 'National Security Reporter']",06-26-2019,2019,6,https://www.thedailybeast.com/mueller-to-testify-on-russia-probe-before-congress,"Special Counsel Robert Mueller has agreed to testify before Congress on July 17 on his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, the House Judiciary Committee and House Intelligence Committee announced Tuesday night.

In a joint statement, House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler and House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff said that Mueller had agreed to testify in an open session.

“Americans have demanded to hear directly from the Special Counsel so they can understand what he and his team examined, uncovered, and determined about Russia’s attack on our democracy, the Trump campaign’s acceptance and use of that help, and President Trump and his associates' obstruction of the investigation into that attack,” they said.

The committees issued subpoenas Tuesday to compel Mueller’s testimony, according to the joint statement. The decision to compel Mueller to testify is a landmark move that will put an end to a months-long saga on Capitol Hill, where lawmakers have for weeks fought to get access to information about whether President Trump obstructed justice.

Part of the congressional efforts, which took place over the last several months, have consisted of suing for documents related to the president and subpoenaing former Trump officials to testify about their time working with the president. But the White House has put forward a strategy of stonewalling Congress at every move, exerting executive privilege and preventing former officials and staffers from testifying.

Mueller’s appearance will mark the first time that anyone from the special counsel’s office has appeared before Congress to testify about the Russia investigation. Throughout the past two years the office has remained steadfast in its silence—only once commenting on a news report. And Congress will be able to question the man at the helm of that investigation about why he and his team said in their report that they could not absolve the president.

Members of both committees are likely to pepper Mueller with questions about what evidence they collected in considering whether President Trump obstructed justice. Lawmakers may also ask why the special counsel’s office decided to allow the president to prepare written answers to interview questions and how Mueller worked with Attorney General Bill Barr in preparing the release of the report. But the former special counsel is not likely to answer questions from Congress about anything outside of the scope of what is written in the report.

Still, Democrats view Mueller’s mere presence in front of Congress, on national television, as a win.

Democratic aides have told The Daily Beast over the last several months that if all else failed, they would at least be able to get Mueller to testify publicly about the report. “That’s all we need,” one aide said earlier this month, adding that the Democrats could win simply by having the former special counsel answer questions in a public setting about the report. “Most Americans haven’t read the Mueller report,” another aide said.

But the negotiations to get Mueller into Congress proved to be more difficult than some lawmakers anticipated. On Tuesday, the committees wrote Mueller a letter, saying they had “consistently communicated” their intention to issue subpoenas, if necessary. “We now understand it is necessary to do so,” the letter said, at the same time acknowledging the former special counsel’s preference of not testifying in front of Congress.

“Nevertheless, the American public deserves to hear directly from you about your investigation and conclusions,” the letter said.

The committee has been working with the Department of Justice on negotiating terms for Mueller’s appearance over the last several weeks. The negotiations have been prolonged in part because of Mueller’s announcement that he would leave the Department of Justice and retire to private life. In his press conference last month in which he announced his resignation, Mueller said he did not wish to appear in front of Congress.

“I hope and expect this to be the only time that I will speak to you in this manner. I am making that decision myself. No one has told me whether I can or should testify or speak further about this matter,” Mueller said in a prepared statement at the time. “There has been discussion about an appearance before Congress. Any testimony from this office would not go beyond our report. It contains our findings and analysis and the reasons for the decisions we made. We chose those words carefully and the work speaks for itself. And the report is my testimony.”

But Mueller’s press conference left lawmakers on Capitol Hill wanting more. In his statement, Mueller also said: “If we had had confidence that the President clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so.”

That remark set off a firestorm of requests from Democrats on the Hill demanding that the House move to impeachment proceedings, saying Mueller’s non-exoneration of Trump was what they needed to move forward. (Mueller and his team had also written in the report that they could not clear the president of wrongdoing.)

Negotiations about Mueller’s potential appearance initially were conducted between the Judiciary Committee and representatives of DOJ. Several weeks into that process, the committee began working with Mueller directly. The negotiations included extensive conversations about how Mueller would testify, including the possibility of him appearing behind closed doors."
"Mueller to Testify to Congress, Setting Up a Political Spectacle",https://www.nytimes.com,['Nicholas Fandos'],06-25-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/25/us/politics/robert-mueller-testify.html,"The hearings will most likely be aired live and in full on network and cable television. With other potential witnesses off limits for now, Mr. Mueller possesses perhaps the singular authority to shift the dynamic in Washington and change the minds of Americans across the country who long since cast their lot with Mr. Trump or his critics.

“Americans have demanded to hear directly from the special counsel so they can understand what he and his team examined, uncovered, and determined about Russia’s attack on our democracy, the Trump campaign’s acceptance and use of that help, and President Trump and his associates’ obstruction of the investigation into that attack,” Mr. Nadler and Mr. Schiff said in a joint statement.

The question is what Mr. Mueller will be willing to say.

From the time he took over the F.B.I.’s investigation of Russia’s election meddling and possible ties to the Trump campaign in May 2017, Mr. Mueller, 74, has been one of the most vexing figures in American public life. He conducted his work in absolute private, despite incessant attacks by Mr. Trump in public and from within the White House, and ultimately issued a lengthy report that raised as many questions as it answered.

In the report, Mr. Mueller detailed Russia’s disinformation and hacking campaigns to sow chaos in the American political system, harm Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign and eventually bolster Mr. Trump. Though he detailed more than 100 contacts between Trump associates and various Russian figures and painted a picture of a campaign that welcomed the foreign assistance, the special counsel ultimately concluded that there was insufficient evidence to charge anyone with conspiring with the Russians to undermine the 2016 election.

Mr. Mueller’s team also extensively investigated whether Mr. Trump’s attempts to thwart its work amounted to obstruction of justice. The special counsel’s report documented 10 such episodes — including orders by Mr. Trump to fire Mr. Mueller, to constrain his investigation and to alter records about what he had done.

Ultimately, the members of Mr. Mueller’s team concluded that because Justice Department policy prohibits indicting a sitting president, they could not determine whether Mr. Trump’s actions had been criminal. But they also clearly stated that they could not exonerate the president of wrongdoing, either, and that the Constitution provides another means of adjudicating possible presidential wrongdoing: Congress."
"Trump Protocol Chief Carried Whip Around the Office, Intimidated Staff: Report",https://www.thedailybeast.com,['Julia Arciga'],06-25-2019,2019,6,https://www.thedailybeast.com/sean-lawler-trump-protocol-chief-carried-whip-around-office-intimidated-staff-report,"A State Department official in charge of diplomatic protocol won’t be attending the G-20 summit in Japan this week amid a potential probe into him toting a whip around the office.

Chief of Protocol Sean Lawler has been “suspended indefinitely” pending the conclusion of an investigation and now plans on resigning from his post, according to Bloomberg and NBC News.

A source told Bloomberg that Lawler faces a potential inspector general investigation into his behavior, which includes “intimidating staff and carrying a whip in the office.” NBC reports that a number of personnel in Lawler’s office had “resigned in protest” due to his “management and behavior.”

Lawler declined to comment to Bloomberg and NBC. The White House and State Department did not respond to Bloomberg’s requests, and the State Department OIG had not yet responded to The Daily Beast’s requests for comment at the time of publication.

In his role, Lawler serves as President Trump’s liaison to the State Department diplomatic corps and handles diplomatic details—including where to stage meetings and in what order dignitaries and leaders should enter a room. NBC reports that assistant chief of protocol Mary-Kate Fisher will attend the G-20 in Lawler’s place.

Lawler was appointed by Trump in 2017, though Bloomberg reports that the president had “little fondness” for him. According to his State Department bio, he’s worked in government for 30 years and is a Navy veteran. He served in similar diplomatically-facing roles for the National Security Council and U.S. Cyber Command."

The judge's decision clears the way for the lawmakers to begin subpoenas for information.

Tuesday's ruling came as Mr Trump was heading to a roundtable event and fundraiser with supporters at his namesake hotel in Washington.

House speaker Nancy Pelosi welcomed the ruling. As the Trump administration largely stonewalls congressional investigations, House Democrats have increasingly turned to the courts for relief. It is the latest of several recent court rulings in their favour.

""No one is above the law - not even the president,"" Ms Pelosi said in a statement. ""Once again, the courts have resoundingly reaffirmed our efforts to hold the president accountable for corruption, and ensure that the president acts in the public interest, not his own interest.""

One of the lead lawmakers in the suit, senator Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn, tweeted, ""This tremendous victory assures that President Trump will be held accountable to the Constitution & the American people — a historic triumph for legally mandated transparency.""

The case argues that the president has received foreign government favours, such as Chinese government trademarks for his companies, payments for hotel room stays and event-space rentals by representatives of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, and proceeds from Chinese or Emirati-linked government purchases of office space in Trump Tower.

Ethics experts say the constitutional emoluments clause was created by the Founding Fathers to ensure that government officials act with the interests of the American public in mind instead of their own pocketbooks.

Unlike prior presidents, Mr Trump chose not to divest from his assets and he remains the owner of the Trump Organisation, a sprawling business empire with 550 entities in more than 20 countries that include branded hotels, golf courses, licensing deals and other interests.

His Washington, DC, hotel is near the White House and has become a magnet for foreign governments, previously hosting groups tied to Kuwait, Bahrain, Turkey, Malaysia and Saudi Arabia.

Robert Mueller agrees to publicly testify in back-to-back House hearings July 17,https://www.marketwatch.com,['Associated Press'],06-25-2019,2019,6,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/robert-mueller-agrees-to-publicly-testify-in-back-to-back-house-hearings-july-17-2019-06-25,"WASHINGTON — Special counsel Robert Mueller has agreed to testify publicly before two House committees after Democrats issued subpoenas to compel him to appear, the chairmen of the two committees announced Tuesday.

The testimony from the former FBI director before the House Judiciary and Intelligence committees is likely to be the most highly anticipated congressional hearing in years, particularly given Mueller’s resolute silence throughout his two-year investigation into Russian contacts with President Donald Trump’s campaign. Mueller never responded to angry, public attacks from Trump, nor did he ever personally join his prosecutors in court or make announcements of criminal charges from the team.

His sole public statement came from the Justice Department podium last month as he announced his departure, when he sought to explain his decision to not indict Trump or to accuse him of criminal conduct. He also put lawmakers on notice that he did not ever intend to say more than what he put in the 448-page report.

“We chose those words carefully and the work speaks for itself,” Mueller said May 29. “I would not provide information beyond what is already public in any appearance before Congress.”

Those remarks did little to settle the demands for his testimony. The two committees continued negotiations that had already been going on for weeks, saying they still wanted to hear from Mueller no matter how reluctant he was.

“When you accept the role of special counsel in one of the most significant investigations in modern history you’re going to have to expect that you’re going to be asked to come and testify before Congress,” House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., told reporters shortly after the announcement.

In the report issued in April, Mueller concluded there was not enough evidence to establish a conspiracy between Trump’s presidential campaign and Russia, which was the original question that started the investigation. But he also said he could not exonerate Trump on obstruction of justice. The report examined several episodes in which Trump attempted to influence the investigation.

Democrats say it is now the job of Congress to assess the report’s findings. Lawmakers are likely to confront Mueller on why he did not come to a firm conclusion on obstruction of justice. They are also likely to seek his reaction to a drumbeat of incessant criticism from the president and ask for his personal opinion about whether Trump would have been charged were he not the commander-in-chief.

Schiff and House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler said they issued the subpoenas Tuesday, and Mueller agreed to testify pursuant to those subpoenas. In a letter to Mueller accompanying the subpoenas, the committee chairmen said “the American public deserves to hear directly from you about your investigation and conclusions.”

Schiff said there will be two hearings “back to back,” one for each committee, and they will also meet with Mueller’s staff in closed session afterward.

The Justice Department declined to comment.

Republicans have criticized Democrats for their robust investigations of the president. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., questioned why they would still want to hear from Mueller after the lengthy report was issued. “He said he didn’t want to talk to us anymore, didn’t he?”

But Georgia Rep. Doug Collins, the top Republican on the Judiciary panel, has said he has no objections to Mueller’s testimony.

“May this testimony bring to House Democrats the closure that the rest of America has enjoyed for months, and may it enable them to return to the business of legislating,” Collins said."
Trump-Kim meeting was 'amazing event' says North Korean media,https://www.theguardian.com,[],07-01-2019,2019,7,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/01/trump-kim-meeting-was-amazing-event-says-north-korean-media,"Pyongyang official news agency says leaders ‘agreed to keep in close touch in future’

North Korea has described the weekend meeting between its leader Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump as “historic” and “amazing”.

Trump became the first sitting US president to set foot in North Korea on Sunday when he met Kim in the demilitarised zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas and agreed to resume stalled nuclear talks.

“The top leaders of the DPRK and the US exchanging historic handshakes at Panmunjom” was an “amazing event”, North Korea’s official KCNA news agency said, describing the truce village as a “place that had been known as the symbol of division”.

KCNA said Kim and Trump discussed “issues of mutual concern and interest which become a stumbling block in solving those issues”.

“The top leaders of the two countries agreed to keep in close touch in the future, too, and resume and push forward productive dialogues for making a new breakthrough in the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula and in the bilateral relations,” said KCNA.

The meeting, initiated by a tweet by Trump on Saturday from the G20, that Kim said took him by surprise, displayed the rapport between the two, but analysts said they were no closer to narrowing the gap between their positions since they walked away from their summit in February in Vietnam.

The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, told reporters shortly before departing South Korea that a new round of talks would likely happen “sometime in July” and the North’s negotiators would be foreign ministry diplomats.

In a photo released by KCNA on Monday, North Korea’s foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, and Pompeo are shown sitting next to Kim and Trump respectively in Freedom House, the building in which the two leaders had their one-on-one talks.

KCNA said that during the chat between Trump and Kim, the two leaders explained “issues of easing tensions on the Korean peninsula” as well as “issues of mutual concern and interest which become a stumbling block in solving those issues,” and “voiced full understanding and sympathy.”

Kim said it was the good personal relationship he had with Trump that made such a dramatic meeting possible at just one day’s notice and that the relationship with Trump would continue to produce good results, according to KCNA.

The two leaders’ “bold, brave decision” that led to the historic meeting “created unprecedented trust between the two countries” that had been tangled in deeply rooted animosity, KCNA said.

Democratic politicians in the US, including presidential frontrunners, said there was little in Trump’s diplomatic track to convince them that his meeting with Kim Jong-un may lead to a nuclear breakthrough.

Trump has come under criticism for what Democrats see as his affinity for authoritarian leaders such as Kim and they are skeptical that the Trump-Kim sit-down would amount to anything more than a photo opportunity.

Senator Chuck Schumer said “dictators seem to get elevated and people who believe in democracy not”. The former housing secretary Julian Castro, a presidential candidate, wondered why Trump was keen to raise Kim’s profile when, according to Castro, Kim has not abided by past commitments on weapons programmes.

Bernie Sanders said he is not opposed to sitting down with America’s adversaries, but he told ABC’s “This Week” that “we need real diplomacy” and he hasn’t seen that under Trump."
Trump’s Solution for Migrant Kid Horrors: Blame Obama,https://www.thedailybeast.com,"['Asawin Suebsaeng', 'Scott Bixby', 'Erin Banco', 'White House Reporter', 'National Reporter', 'National Security Reporter']",06-26-2019,2019,6,https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-sees-dire-migrant-detention-conditions-as-messaging-problem,"As news broke on the reportedly horrific conditions at a Texas detention center holding migrant children, President Trump did what he normally does in times of crisis and public-relations hellscapes: He monitored the media and political reactions via his White House TV and the DVR device he dubs his “super TiVo.”

And in the days since the treatment of small children at this detention facility became major national news, the president wanted to make one thing clear to his subordinates, though his focus was not at all about ameliorating appalling conditions. Trump has repeatedly told advisers and senior aides that, no matter how great the public outrage toward his administration, his lieutenants were to stick to a simple strategy of blaming Democrats and Trump’s predecessor, Barack Obama, according to two people with knowledge of the exchanges.

In the end for Trump, the dire situation was a mere messaging problem.

The strategy was a practical Xerox of the president’s approach to other immigration scandals of the Trump era, such as the brutal, widely condemned family-separation policy. When the president and his team don’t want to own the negative coverage and political backlash to the treatment of migrants, asylum-seekers, or undocumented immigrants—but also want to continue draconian policies nonetheless—they frequently revert to trashing the Democrats as the real culprits.

“Well, they’re better than, much better than Obama… The conditions are much better than they were under President Obama,” Trump alleged during an interview with The Hill on Monday, when asked about Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s characterization that he was presiding over an American “concentration camp.”

On Sunday, Vice President Mike Pence told CNN host Jake Tapper that it was the “Democrats in Congress” who had “refused to expand the bed space and the capacity for us to detain people at our borders,” when pressed on detention-center conditions. “It is one of the reasons why we continue to call on Congress to give [the Department of Homeland Security], Customs and Border Protection additional resources at the border.” This led to a somewhat tense back-and-forth, with Tapper arguing that funds already exist to provide these children with blankets and hygiene products.

The Department of Homeland Security has for more than a year at times relied on its advisory council for suggestions on how to better serve the children and families detained in border facilities. A subcommittee of the council traveled to the border facilities in Texas over the last five months and drew up a report for former Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, reiterating the dire need for resources handling children. One council member said the visits illuminated the overcrowding of facilities and the need for better transportation services for individuals crossing the border and being placed in more permanent shelters.

“[Customs and Border Patrol] personnel are... tending to the daily needs of thousands of illegal migrants who CBP has already processed but is left holding for days and sometimes weeks in confinement space that was built decades ago and designed to confine only a fraction of these illegal migrants for hours, not days or weeks, and certainly not intended to confine tender age children,” the report said.

“ The head of the subcommittee that focuses on children and families has been on vacation, according to sources affiliated with the council. ”

The advisory council has not been in contact with the DHS secretary’s office over the last week, according to council members, and the head of the subcommittee that focuses on children and families has been on vacation, according to sources affiliated with the council, which consists of professional volunteers.

And the conditions in the detention centers are often abysmal. Nearly 300 children were temporarily removed from the Clint detention facility in Texas after media reports alleged horrifying conditions within: sick children whose clothes were covered in mucus, children who had only brushed their teeth a single time since being detained, and children sleeping on concrete floors. Many of those children have since been returned to the Clint facility.

The increasingly dire conditions in detention facilities across the U.S. southern border are part and parcel of the Trump administration’s immigration agenda. The increasing scarcity of resources at Border Patrol stations and ICE detention facilities, from access to adequate medical care to beds and bathrooms with potable water, are the consequences of an immigration system straining to accommodate an increasing number of detainees—as well as, advocates posit, a purposeful warning to would-be migrants in Central America thinking of heading north.

“The Trump administration’s focus, almost since its inception, has been deterrence of asylum-seekers,” said Melissa Crow, a senior supervising attorney at the Southern Poverty Law Center. According to Crow, members of the Trump administration have determined that if detention facilities were better staffed and better maintained, “then more people would come.”

“The constraints are sort of artificial,” Crow said.

Instability at the Department of Homeland Security—due in no small part to pressure from the White House to enact an unpopular, occasionally contradictory agenda—has likely played a part in bureaucratic difficulties.

Within the past two two months, the Department of Homeland Security has seen the resignations of Nielsen, Acting ICE Director Ron Vitiello, Acting Deputy Secretary Claire Grady, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Director Lee Francis Cissna, and, as of Tuesday morning, Acting Commissioner of Customs and Border Protection John Sanders. Later on Tuesday, it was announced that Mark Morgan, acting director of ICE, would be named as Sanders’ successor.

But at the heart of the worsening conditions in detention centers, advocates for immigrants in the legal system said, is a lack of concern for the children and families being held within them.

“We have billions of dollars in appropriations meant to address the humanitarian crisis on the border,” said Angelica Salas, executive director of the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles. “Why do we still have children who are sleeping on floors?”"

A month after the former FBI director said he did not intend to appear before legislators, it was announced he would be a witness to two committees of the House of Representatives – the judiciary committee, and the intelligence committee. He is scheduled to appear on July 17.

When he delivered a rare public statement last month, his first in connection with the investigation into Moscow’s alleged interference and possible contacts between Russia and members of Mr Trump’s campaign, the 74-year-old said he would rather his work speak for itself.

His decision was a major blow to Democrats who had hoped to press Mr Mueller, both on his probe and his conclusion. In his 448-page report, special counsel said while found no evidence of collusion, he was not able to exonerate the president on the question of possible obstruction of justice.

Expanding on another point he made in the report when he spoke last month, Mr Mueller said department of justice guidelines had made it impossible for him to consider indicting a sitting president.

Rather, he suggested it was the job of politicians to pick up the probe, leading many to believe the special counsel was suggesting Democrats should pursue an impeachment inquiry.

“The constitution requires a process other than the criminal justice system to formally accuse a sitting president of wrongdoing,” Mr Mueller said.

Attorney general William Barr took the decision not to charge the president.

It emerged on Tuesday that Democrats had never give up on their hope to have Mr Mueller appear before them. The president has told the White House not to cooperate with requests for information or testimonies.

But congressmen Jerry Nadler and Adam Schiff, the Democratic chairs of the judiciary committee and intelligence committee respectively, said in a joint statement that Mr Mueller had agreed to testify after the two committees issued subpoenas.

“Americans have demanded to hear directly from the special counsel so they can understand what he and his team examined, uncovered, and determined about Russia’s attack on our democracy, the Trump campaign’s acceptance and use of that help, and President Trump and his associates’ obstruction of the investigation into that attack,” they said in a statement.

Doug Collins, the top Republican on the judiciary Committee, said in a statement: “I hope the special counsel’s testimony marks an end to the political gamesmanship that judiciary Democrats have pursued at great cost to taxpayers.”

Speaking on MSNBC, Mr Schiff said: “We never felt it was sufficient to rely simply on a written report or a 10-minute statement without the ability to follow up with questions.”

There was no immediate word whether Mr Trump or the White House would attempt to prevent Mr Mueller testifying.

READ: The Mueller report makes a damning case that Trump obstructed justice

Mueller has resisted testifying publicly and declined to express an opinion on the interpretation of his report offered up by Trump’s handpicked attorney general, William Barr.

But his testimony before Congress could reignite Democratic efforts to keep the report in the news and advance the cause of impeachment.

Mueller has already said his public comments won’t go beyond what’s in his report. But Democrats and legal observers have argued that the facts in the report are bad enough — and that even a public recitation of those details could help raise awareness of Mueller’s findings.

Read: Democrats’ grand plan to contain Iran? Just beat Trump

Certainly he’s bellicose. In a Tuesday-morning tweet, he threatened Iran with “obliteration.” Yet he has largely drawn from a predictable set of tools to deter and punish adversaries: economic—not military—warfare. When Iran shot down a U.S. drone last week, Trump said he would not “stand for it.” But after preparing a military strike against Iranian targets, he abruptly pulled back. Instead, he levied yet another round of sanctions on Iran, targeting the country’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

Are the sanctions working? Since withdrawing from the nuclear deal last year, Trump has imposed round after round of sanctions on Iran—including one meant to drive oil exports, the lifeblood of Iran’s economy, to zero. There’s little evidence that the sanctions have cowed Iran’s leadership. Iran’s behavior, if anything, has grown more belligerent on Trump’s watch—and additional sanctions could squeeze the country to the point where it feels compelled to escalate tensions even further, experts said. After Trump signed an executive order approving the latest round of sanctions, Iranian officials said they would not agree to negotiations with the U.S.

“There’s a pattern where his [Trump’s] rhetoric is far tougher than his actions, where he’s much more willing to threaten the use of force than to actually use it,” Richard Haass, the president of the Council on Foreign Relations and a former State Department official under President George W. Bush, told me. “Sanctions and tariffs have become the instruments of this administration. We see very little in the way of diplomacy and very little in the way of military force. In almost every situation, we see economic instruments.”

Underpinning Trump’s foreign policy is a vow that, when threatened, the U.S. won’t bluff. He ridiculed his predecessor, Barack Obama, for letting the Syrian regime mount a chemical attack in 2013 with impunity, even though Obama once called the use of such weapons an unacceptable “red line.”

Read: Trump goes after Iran’s supreme leader

“Our friends and enemies must know that if I draw a line in the sand, I will enforce that line in the sand, believe me,” Trump said in the same 2016 foreign-policy speech. Trump has drawn plenty of red lines in the past few weeks, only to erase and reposition them when it suits him. Talking to reporters last week about the downed drone, he suggested that his red line for a military counterattack would be American casualties. Had the aircraft been manned, he said, “it would have made a big difference, let me tell you.”"

Trump opponents turn the Mueller report into an art form,https://www.apnews.com,['Hillel Italie'],06-25-2019,2019,6,https://www.apnews.com/8418af735a1847ac8ef62f929893af01,"FILE - In this April 18, 2019, file photo, special counsel Robert Mueller's redacted report on Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election is photographed in Washington.

NEW YORK (AP) — Liz Zito is a multimedia artist so immersed in the Mueller Report that she wrote fan fiction to fill in the parts that were redacted by the Justice Department. When she worried that other Americans didn’t know about the findings of special counsel Robert Mueller, she found her own way to make them accessible: A “performative reading” in downtown Manhattan.

“When you deliver a comedic performance, you want people to laugh at all the jokes, but a lot of positive feedback from that night came from people learning what was actually in the report and how manipulated we all were-are as world citizens,” Zito says of her June 13 show at the gallery 601 Artspace.

First made public in April, the Mueller report detailing the results of the two-year investigation into whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia is no longer just a book or a document to read online. It is a work of theater and other art forms, and a touchstone for Donald Trump opponents seeking to highlight his alleged misconduct, including possible attempts by the president to impede or halt the investigation.

Over the past month, there have been readings in New York, Washington and elsewhere. A San Diego-based publisher, IDW, is planning a graphic novel and at least one musical act, Electric Parrot, has named a song after it.

On Monday night, an all-star reading from New York City’s Riverside Church featured John Lithgow, Annette Bening and others. The event was presented and livestreamed by Law Works, which identifies itself as a bipartisan organization that advocates for the rule of law.

“If Americans aren’t going to read the report, we wanted to help them watch it,” says Law Works executive director David Wade. “We’ve found that once Americans learn the facts, their concerns skyrocket.”

The 448-page report has sold hundreds of thousands of copies in book form even though it can be downloaded for free from the Justice Department’s web site (https://www.justice.gov/storage/report.pdf). But according to a CNN poll released in May, three-quarters of the respondents said they had not read it.

From the start, the Mueller Report has been treated like a work of interpretative art. As Mueller and his team were reviewing documents and interviewing Trump’s associates, Trump and his supporters repeatedly called it a “WITCH HUNT.” Opponents, meanwhile, speculated that the report’s findings would prove so devastating that the president would be forced out of office.

Ultimately, Mueller found the Russians had interfered with the 2016 election, but decided there was no evidence that the Trump campaign had conspired with Russia. In reviewing whether Trump obstructed justice, however, Mueller wrote that while “this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.” He also noted that a sitting president cannot be charged.

Mueller’s refusal to reach a conclusion on criminal obstruction opened the door for Attorney General William Barr to clear Trump, who in turn has cited the attorney general’s finding as proof of his innocence. Last month, Mueller declared publicly that his Russia report did not exonerate Trump, and reiterated that charging the sitting president was not an option because of federal rules.

One of the first Mueller readings happened early this month, the 24-hour “Filibustered and Unfiltered: America Reads the Mueller Report,” at the New York City venue The Arc. The idea was spontaneous, director Jackson Gay said. Soon after the report came out, she jokingly posted on Facebook that maybe she should stage a reading. The response was so enthusiastic that she found it “impossible not to go ahead.” Gay says she has since heard from organizations all around the country, from Richmond, Virginia, to Seattle. She’s even putting together a how-to booklet, with advice ranging from securing rights to film the actors to renting chairs.

“What’s beautiful about all of the readings is that you’re allowing people to come and make up their own minds,” she says. “We encourage the performers to read the report as straightforwardly as possible. If somebody gets up there and comments on it than they’re really no better than the talking heads on TV.”"
Feel smug about western democracy? The G20 summit should make us reconsider | Nesrine Malik,https://www.theguardian.com,['Nesrine Malik'],06-30-2019,2019,6,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/30/western-democracy-putin-g20,"Next year, an Arab country will host the G20 summit for the first time. Which country has earned this honour? Such recognition as a player in this powerful global club? Its impressive climb in this regard is even more remarkable given that only a few short months ago, this Arab state was supposedly on its way to pariah status.

That’s right. Saudi Arabia is hosting the 2020 summit, managing to not only overcome the reputational damage of the murder of Jamal Khashoggi in the country’s consulate in Turkey less than a year ago, but also doing so just weeks after more grisly details of the killing were revealed. Saudi officials were reported to have referred to Khashoggi as “the sacrificial animal” while discussing how he was to be dismembered. Saudi’s moment of coming in from the (relative) cold even had an official photo at last week’s G20 summit. All the world leaders lined up, looked at the camera and waved, apart from Donald Trump and Mohammed bin Salman – lost in mutual adoration – who only had eyes for each other.

To drive Putin’s point home even more brutally, Trump exchanged some friendly badinage with the Russian president

Vladimir Putin’s comments to the Financial Times at the G20 about the death of liberalism (an idea that has “outlived its purpose”) could not have come at a more appropriate moment. It felt like a eulogy to the memory of Khashoggi’s murder. Putin’s just a troll, some said, best ignored. He wants attention, it’s a diversion, have you seen the state of Russia’s economy? And how do you define liberalism anyway? All this is true. Putin might not be the best qualified political scientist to define what liberalism is and when it is in decline, but I think it is fair to say that liberalism is not in the greatest of health.

Before we get lost in definitional defensiveness, I don’t mean the everyday sort of liberalism, one that is probably better described as cosmopolitanism. The kind that makes you look around your diverse locality, the quiet tolerance of the majority and think that all is well. Not the kind of liberalism that is borne out by polls showing that there is increased acceptance of immigration or LGBT people. Or the liberalism of technical democracy, where we still elect leaders in free and fair(ish) elections. This is corporate campaign liberalism, new Arsenal kit launch, urban fist-bumping liberalism.

What is in trouble is the liberalism that underscores political process, legislation and mobilisation. We live in a time where individual liberty and the spoils of freedom are meted out based on a racial and economic hierarchy, where political victories are won by promising that rights and privileges will be taken away from those who haven’t “earned it” – the poor, the undocumented and the simply different – a divide between the deserving and the undeserving. It is more than rhetoric; lives are directly affected by this, further disenfranchised by the loss of benefits, the impossibility of full and legal settlement in a new country, and the everyday stigmatisation of Muslims. “Plain speaking” and being “done with political correctness” is cover for this segregation of rights.

Play Video 1:11 Trump tells Putin: don't meddle in the US presidential election - video

That was the most chilling aspect of Putin’s comments – it is not hard to imagine them being spoken by a supposedly more genteel western politician. Criticism of multiculturalism, scaremongering on trans identity (“They claim now that children can play five or six gender roles,” said Putin) and the rhetoric of the elite abandoning the “real people” is all too common. As much as we try to put clear daylight between the state of Anglo-American liberalism and Putin’s shambolic dictatorship, the more the facts confound us.

Donald Tusk, presumably imagining himself in a sort of West Wing version of the EU, disagreed so much with Putin that, unfortunately, in his indignation he ended up reinforcing the point. What Tusk finds “really obsolete is authoritarianism, personality cults and the rule of oligarchs”. Authoritarianism, personality cults and the rule of oligarchs? We certainly could not see that in the UK, where the Conservative party is on its way to self-destruction while it drags the country with it for the sake of power sought through appealing to an authoritarian populist streak. And where a man such as Boris Johnson is about to become prime minister on the back of a personality cult worshipped by a narrow Conservative electorate, and billionaires (we don’t call them oligarchs here, that’s reserved for foreigners) are investigated for breaking the law in funding political campaigns.

Just to drive Putin’s point home even more brutally, Trump exchanged some friendly badinage with the Russian president at the beginning of their first formal meeting at the summit. Referring to journalists, Trump said, “Get rid of them. Fake news is a great term, isn’t it? You don’t have this problem in Russia but we do.” Putin responded, in English: “We also have. It’s the same.” A warm chuckle followed. A few days later, Trump became the first sitting US president to set foot in North Korea after making overtures to Kim Jong-un. Trump looks no longer like an anomaly – more like a member of the demagogue gang.

Forget Putin’s ‘liberalism’ jibe. This man runs a war machine | Natalie Nougayrède Read more

There is still a fixation on the practical differences between straight dictatorships such as Saudi Arabia, Russia and North Korea and western countries where the practical processes of universal suffrage and rule of law are still in place. No one is seizing power by force or suspending constitutions here. But the belief in this rigid distinction is a narcissism that fails to account for all the ways a liberal order can be undermined within the confines of what appears a robust democracy. Putin put it rather well when pressed by the FT on the fact that he was handed power from Boris Yeltsin 20 years ago. He shrugged: “So what?”

Sitting in the UK as Johnson is about to be the second unelected PM in a row, ruling a party and a country paralysed by a hastily and poorly planned referendum, I would say the same to those who argue that at least we live in a democracy. So what?

"US Sanctions Put Telecoms Firms Off Cuba, Internet Task Force Says",https://www.voanews.com,"['Voa News', 'Written By']",,,,https://www.voanews.com/americas/us-sanctions-put-telecoms-firms-cuba-internet-task-force-says,"HAVANA - U.S. sanctions on Cuba are deterring American firms from exploring its telecommunications sector even as Washington seeks to expand internet access on the Communist-run island, according to the final report of a U.S. government task force released on Tuesday.

Chinese companies dominate Cuba's telecoms sector, a status quo ""worth challenging given concerns that the Cuban government potentially obtains its censorship equipment from Chinese Internet infrastructure providers,"" the report said.

Cuba's government protested the U.S. State Department's creation of a Cuba Internet Task Force last year as ""foreign interference."" It remains unclear how open it would be to U.S. investment in the strategic telecoms sector.

""U.S. companies informed the subcommittees they are often deterred from entering the market due to uncertainty caused by frequent changes to U.S. regulations concerning Cuba,"" according to the task force, convened last year by the State Department.

U.S. presidents have successively tightened and loosened the decades-old U.S. trade embargo on Cuba imposed in the years after its 1959 revolution.

Former President Barack Obama created a loophole for U.S. telecommunications companies to provide certain services to Cuba. His successor, Donald Trump, maintained the loophole but tightened the broader sanctions, worsening the overall business climate.

Banks are increasingly reluctant to process payments originating in Cuba. Some telecoms firms surveyed by the task force said that was putting them off offering key services and products in the country.

The task force advised the U.S. government to clear up the regulatory uncertainty and seek feedback on how to improve telecoms firms' ability to invest.

Until 2013, the internet was largely available to the public in Cuba only at tourist hotels amid the U.S. embargo, lack of cash and concerns over the free flow of information.

The government has increased web access in recent years, installing a fiber-optic cable to Venezuela and introducing cyber cafes, Wi-Fi hot spots and mobile internet.

Cuban telecoms monopoly ETECSA signed a deal earlier this year with Alphabet's Google on increasing connectivity, but the two have not publicly agreed on any significant investments."
Robert Mueller To Testify Before House Judiciary And Intelligence Committees,https://www.huffpost.com,['Reporter'],06-25-2019,2019,6,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/mueller-testify-house-judiciary-house-intel_n_5d12c4d0e4b0a394186a47e4,"Robert Mueller agreed Tuesday to testify before the House Judiciary Committee and House Intelligence Committee in an open session, marking the first time the special counsel will publicly answer questions about his investigative report.

The special counsel is set to appear before both committees in separate but back-to-back hearings on July 17, according to Reps. Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) and Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), who chair the judiciary and intelligence committees, respectively.

“Americans have demanded to hear directly from the Special Counsel so they can understand what he and his team examined, uncovered, and determined about Russia’s attack on our democracy, the Trump campaign’s acceptance and use of that help, and President Trump and his associates’ obstruction of the investigation into that attack,” Nadler and Schiff said in a joint statement. “We look forward to hearing his testimony, as do all Americans.”

I am pleased to announce that @HouseJudiciary and House Intel will have Special Counsel Robert Mueller testify in open session on July 17, pursuant to a subpoena issued this evening. https://t.co/wR0CEVqpJC

The agreement came the same day the committees issued a subpoena to bring Mueller in to testify about his report detailing Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential elections and potential incidents in which Donald Trump obstructed justice.

“We further understand that there are certain sensitivities associated with your open testimony,” Nadler and Schiff wrote to Mueller earlier Tuesday, alluding to criminal investigations the special counsel has referred to other Justice Department offices. “Nevertheless, the American public deserves to hear directly from you about your investigation and conclusions.”

Here’s the letter Jerry Nadler and Adam Schiff sent to Robert Mueller. pic.twitter.com/ABekW8OyTC — Sahil Kapur (@sahilkapur) June 26, 2019

Schiff confirmed to CNN that the judiciary and intelligence committees will each have their own separate hearing to question Mueller on July 17. The intelligence committee will reportedly have an open session but later go into a closed session with Mueller’s staff, according to the network.

The agreement is a victory for Nadler, who has long sought public testimony from Mueller. The special counsel has previously expressed not wanting to publicly testify, but said that if he did, he would not go beyond the parameters of what’s in his lengthy report, which he said speaks for itself.

Trump lawyer Jay Sekulow told NBC that Mueller “said his testimony was his report. We expect that his testimony will be his report.”

In May, Mueller made a rare appearance before the cameras to encourage Americans to read the report, reiterating that while Trump could not be charged with a crime while in office, that does not mean he is exonerated.

Though nothing Mueller said during that appearance was new information, his statements before the cameras resulted in a wave of Democrats confidently calling for an impeachment inquiry into the president.

House Democrats are hoping Mueller’s public, televised testimony on July 17 will provide similar clarity about the special counsel’s findings to the American public.

Democrats also argued that Mueller’s testimony is important because the White House continues to prevent witnesses from testifying before Congress about incidents Mueller detailed in his report.

“We are pleased that the American people will hear directly from Special Counsel Mueller,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said in a statement. “Our national security is being threatened and the American people deserve answers.”

"In NATO Debut, New Pentagon Chief Aims to ‘Internationalize' Iran Effort",https://www.voanews.com,['Written By'],,,,https://www.voanews.com/usa/nato-debut-new-pentagon-chief-aims-internationalize-iran-effort,"WASHINGTON - Acting U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper said on Tuesday he aimed to recruit support from NATO allies for U.S. efforts to deter conflict with Iran and ""open the door to diplomacy,"" as he made his international debut as Pentagon chief.

Esper emphasized diplomacy over military action as he briefed reporters for the first time since taking the helm of the U.S. military on Monday. The former Army secretary was thrust into the position after the surprise resignation of Patrick Shanahan as acting defense secretary the previous week.

Ahead of talks with European defense ministers, Esper said he would tell allies that the United States was not seeking war with Iran.

FILE - U.S. Secretary of the Army Mark Esper speaks during a House Armed Services Committee budget hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington, April 2, 2019.

His remarks came just days after U.S. President Donald Trump narrowly called off strikes against military targets in Iran over Tehran's downing of a U.S. drone. But Trump threatened on Tuesday to obliterate parts of Iran if it attacked ""anything American.""

""We need to internationalize this issue and have our allies and partners work with us to get Iran to come back to the negotiating table,"" Esper said shortly before landing in Brussels, home to NATO headquarters.

Washington's European allies, critical of Trump's decision to withdraw from a 2015 nuclear deal with Iran, have reacted with alarm in recent weeks, repeatedly warning both sides of the danger that a small mistake could lead to war.

U.S. officials said on Monday that the United States was building a coalition with its allies to protect Gulf shipping lanes following recent attacks on oil tankers that Washington blamed on Iran.

But Esper suggested the plan was still in its early stages and played down the idea that U.S. allies would offer up the majority of ships, saying: ""Nobody's counting ships or compositions at this point in time.""

Asked what he wanted U.S. allies to do on Iran, Esper said: ""Express with us the concern, outrage ... with regard to Iran's activities in the region. That would be a good first step.""

""And then secondly, to support any range of activities we may think merit participation to help, again, deter conflict and show that we're resolute. What we're trying to do, what we want to do, is to close the door to conflict and open the door to diplomacy.""

NATO “speed dating""

Esper is now the third person in six months to work at the defense secretary's desk, stoking fresh questions about leadership at the Pentagon.

For many NATO allies, this week's NATO defense ministerial will be a unique chance to get an early sense of Esper, who has deep roots in the U.S. military, Congress and even the U.S. defense industry.

It will be a similar opportunity for Esper, who said he aimed to emphasize to NATO allies that the change in leadership at the Pentagon did not represent a change in policy.

""A NATO ministerial is a good way to get to know key partners, kind of like diplomatic speed-dating,"" said Derek Chollet, a former senior Pentagon official during the Obama administration.

FILE - General James Mattis testifies before the Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington, July 27, 2010.

Chollet said allies would be closely watching for hints about the kind of role Esper will play, including whether he might be like Jim Mattis, Trump's first defense secretary who was a strong advocate for NATO and was seen as a moderating influence on the U.S. president.

Mattis, who resigned in December over policy differences with Trump, brought Esper into the job.

One European diplomat joked: ""Jim Mattis is not someone we can clone, as much as we'd like to, but Esper is talked about positively.""

""Everyone will want to make a good impression and to get some time because he is the new face of the Pentagon,"" the diplomat said."

Jimmy Carter says Russian election interference makes Trump an ‘illegitimate president.’,https://www.good.is,"['Sarah Schuster', 'Eric Pfeiffer', 'Gabriel Reilich', 'Orli Matlow', 'Tod Perry', 'Jessie Dean Altman', 'April Lavalle', 'Jamie Lutz']",06-28-2019,2019,6,https://www.good.is/articles/carter-calls-trump-illigitimate,"There’s an unspoken rule among former U.S. presidents to not criticize your successors. George W. Bush refrained from criticizing Barack Obama during his presidency.

“It’s a hard job. He’s got plenty on his agenda. It’s difficult.,” Bush told CNN. “A former president doesn't need to make it any harder. Other presidents have taken different decisions; that’s mine.”

Barack Obama said he’d remain quiet about Trump unless he threatened the DACA program. After Trump decided to end the program Obama released a scathing Facebook post. Last year, he hit back at him again saying he capitalized “on resentment that politicians have been fanning for years.”

Former president Jimmy Carter has had no problem violating the unspoken rule and calling out his successors. He called the George W. Bush administration “the worst in history.” He also criticized Obama for his dealings with Iran and North Korea and spoke out against Bill Clinton’s controversial pardon of Marc Rich.

Carter has also been very critical of Donald Trump, saying his campaign “tapped into a waiting reservoir of racism.”

On Friday, June 28, Carter took his criticism of Trump even further by deeming his entire presidency “illegitimate.”

Speaking at a Carter Center event at a resort in Leesburg, Virginia, on Friday, Carter was asked by moderator John Meacham how the U.S. should respond to Russia’s involvement in the 2016 election.

Carter replied:

“Well, the president himself should condemn it, admit that it happened, which I think 16 [of the] intelligence agencies have already agreed to say. And there's no doubt that the Russians did interfere in the election. And I think the interference although not yet quantified, if fully investigated would show that Trump didn’t actually win the election in 2016. He lost the election, and he was put into office because the Russians interfered on his behalf.”

Meacham then asked Carter to clarify his remarks. “So, do you believe President Trump is an illegitimate president?” he asked.

“Based on what I just said, which I can’t retract, I would say yes,” the 94-year old said with a grin.

After the Mueller Report and confirmation from multiple U.S. intelligence agencies, there is no doubt that Russia interfered in the 2016 election to help Donald Trump get elected. The only real question is whether it tipped the scales in favor of him winning or whether he would have made it to the Oval Office without foreign intervention.

It’s stunning to hear a former president call one of the members of his small club ‘illegitimate,” but what’s even more shocking is that he may be right. The sitting president of the United States was quite possibly installed by a hostile foreign power.

After all, while Clinton beat Trump in the popular vote by nearly 3 million votes, Trump’s victory in the electoral college was decided by only 77,744 votes in three states.

Kathleen Hall Jamieson, a co-founder of FactCheck.org and author of “Cyberwar: How Russian Hackers and Trolls Helped Elect a President—What We Don’t, Can’t, and Do Know,” believes it’s “likely” that Russian interference changed the outcome of the election.

When asked Trump would be President without the aid of Russians, she told The New Yorker, “No. If everything else is a constant? No, I do not.”

In 2018, our partners at Upworthy posted a tongue-in-cheek article endorsing Jimmy Carter for president in 2020 because the one-termer is such a fundamentally different human being than Trump. But one can hope that in 2020 they wind up sharing something in common: being one-term presidents.

Hypocrisy At The Border: Trump Villified For Obama's Immigration Policy,https://www.zerohedge.com,[],06-29-2019,2019,6,https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2019-06-29/hypocrisy-border-trump-villified-obamas-immigration-policy,"Authored by Kelli Ballard via LibertyNation.com,

If “caging kids” was okay for Obama, what makes it inhumane for Trump?

Now that the first round of Democratic debates are out of the way, it’s time to hammer down on the left’s constant caterwauling about the president’s immigration policies and caging of kids. The relentless barrage of insults aimed at Donald Trump for his cruelty and inhumane actions towards illegal aliens, families, and children is reminiscent of rabid wolves looking for their next victim. They are so far out of their minds with Trump Derangement Syndrome they can’t see the truth: These heinous tactics and polices were instituted before the Trump administration.

Democrats frequently praise former president Barack Obama but conveniently forget about his strict immigration policies, many of which they attribute to Trump today and call outrageous and cold-hearted. In a 2014 interview with ABC News, Obama talked about the impossibility of tracking all of the children who get sold into sex slavery and other nefarious endings and warns immigrants not to send their kids to America. “So, that is our direct message to the families in Central America, do not send your children to the borders. If they do make it, they’ll get sent back. More importantly, they may not make it.”

Obama’s Detention Centers Vs Trump’s Concentration Camps

Recently, as Liberty Nation’s Jeff Charles reported, the dim-witted media darling Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) compared the migrant detention centers to the horrific concentration camps of the Holocaust. “The United States is running concentration camps on our southern border and that is exactly what they are,” she said. First, the young representative needs to learn the differences between the two – of which there are many. Second, we are using the exact same centers that were put into place under the Obama administration.

Thomas Homan was Obama’s executive associate director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement for nearly four years. He confirmed that these facilities were the former president’s conception.

“I’ve been to that facility, where they talk about cages,” he said. “That facility was built under President Obama under [Homeland Security] Secretary Jeh Johnson. I was there because I was there when it was built.”

During an immigration conference on June 26, Homan cited an instance where the Democratic chairman had asked a Trump official if kids were still being kept in cages:

“I would answer the question, ‘The kids are being house in the same facility built under the Obama administration.’ If you want to call them cages, call them cages. But if the left wants to call them cages and the Democrats want to call them cages then they have to accept the fact that they were built and funded in FY 2015.”

About those cages: “It’s chain link dividers that keeps children separate from unrelated adults,” he said. “It’s about protecting children.”

Caged Migrant Children Photo Goes Viral As Left Rages At Trump...Except It Happened Under Obama https://t.co/0ZsJyQHqjz — Jack Posobiec 🇺🇸 (@JackPosobiec) May 28, 2018

While Democrats like Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) go around claiming that illegal immigrants shouldn’t be considered illegal, Obama had the opposite view.

“Even as we are a nation of immigrants, we are also a nation of laws,” he said in an address to the nation in Nov. 2014. “Undocumented workers broke our immigration laws, and I believe that they must be held accountable. Especially those who may be dangerous.”

The left’s continued narrative of caging children and separating families is redundant and grossly exaggerated. They refuse to acknowledge any positives our president introduces, such as when he signed Executive Order #13841, ordering that detained families would not be separated unless the parents pose a danger to the child.

Democrats also ignore the very real threat of the invasion of hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens trying to force their way across our border daily. The left lost their minds when Trump declared a national emergency to combat the migrant war at our southern border.

“Two women have publicly said columnist E. Jean Carroll confided in them after Donald Trump allegedly raped her in the 1990s.



Carol Martin and Lisa Birnbach at the time disagreed on whether Ms Carroll should call the police, the New York Times newspaper reports.



President Trump denies the allegation, saying Ms Carroll is ""totally lying"" and ""she's not my type"".



Ms Carroll, 75, is the 16th woman to accuse Mr Trump of sexual misconduct.



What did Ms Martin and Ms Birnbach say?

Ms Martin, a TV news anchor in 1975-95, and Ms Birnbach, a writer, spoke publicly for the first time about the alleged sexual assault on the New York Times podcast The Daily.



Ms Carroll, the Elle columnist, said in the same podcast she had called Ms Birnbach straight after the alleged assault, telling her that Mr Trump had forced himself on her.



Ms Birnbach responded by saying she thought it was rape, urging Ms Carroll to call the police.



""Let's go to the police. I'll take you to the police"" Ms Birnbach said, but added that her friend refused.”

Sean Hannity Has A Trumpian Freak-Out Over Mueller Testimony News,https://www.huffpost.com,['Reporter'],06-26-2019,2019,6,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/fox-news-sean-hannity-donald-trump-robert-mueller_n_5d1337c2e4b0a394186b3622,"Fox News’ Sean Hannity was nothing if but true to form when he expressed his outrage at Tuesday’s announcement that former special counsel Robert Mueller will testify before Congress.

Mueller agreed to appear on July 17 to answer questions in open session about his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and possible Trump campaign collusion.

The host of “Hannity,” who often uses his widely watched prime time show to stump for Trump, predictably criticized the news and claimed Democrats were “harassing and abusing their power.”

“They are harassing the office of the president,” Hannity alleged, echoing President Donald Trump’s “presidential harassment” complaints. “This isn’t oversight, this is now ‘try and harass the president time.’”

Check out the clip here:

Hannity’s “harassment” allegation was straight from Trump’s Twitter feed:

Presidential Harassment! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 26, 2019

PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT! It should never be allowed to happen again! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 7, 2019

The prospect of Presidential Harassment by the Dems is causing the Stock Market big headaches! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 12, 2018

PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 18, 2019

Hannity last week vowed on his podcast to go out on the 2020 reelection trail with Trump, whose supporters he said would “be sick of seeing me by the end of the campaign.”"
