Trump team braces GOP donors for a potential ‘moderate and short’ recession,https://www.politico.com,['Nancy Cook'],08-20-2019,2019,8,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/08/20/donald-trump-gop-donors-recession-1470360,"President Donald Trump walks on stage to address construction workers in Pennsylvania. Trump and top White House officials are worried about a global economic slowdown that could trigger a U.S. recession.

| Andrew Rush/Post-Gazette via AP Economy Trump team braces GOP donors for a potential ‘moderate and short’ recession The White House is weighing cuts to corporate and payroll taxes, among other measures, to cushion the U.S. economy if an election-year recession hits.

In public, President Donald Trump and top White House officials keep extolling the strength of the U.S. economy. In private, they’re increasingly worrying about a global economic slowdown triggering a U.S. recession — and weighing options to shore up the economy ahead of an election year.

At a fundraising luncheon this week in Jackson, Wyo., headlined by both Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney acknowledged the risks to the GOP elite behind closed doors. If the U.S. were to face a recession, it would be “moderate and short,” Mulvaney told roughly 50 donors, according to an attendee.

White House officials are discussing a broader package of measures than previously disclosed, including a cut of an additional percentage point or two to the corporate tax rate. That’s on top of a potential payroll tax cut, which the Obama administration had used to shore up the economy, and a move to index the capital gains rate to inflation, which potentially could be done through an executive order and has internal support from the National Economic Council, the vice president’s office and Mulvaney. Pegging the capital gains rate to inflation would exempt some gains from taxation.

“We have been talking about indexing for a long time,” Trump told reporters Tuesday afternoon. “I can do it directly.”

Any other tax cuts would have to pass Congress, an unlikely endeavor given the Democratic-controlled House. One close White House adviser called the idea of additional tax cuts a “talking point” to show the White House is considering options to help the economy, while a Republican operative called proposing additional tax cuts right now “quixotic.”

“I've been thinking about payroll taxes for a long time,” Trump added. “Whether or not we do it now or not is — it's not being done because of recession.”

The president and his aides are well aware that Trump’s strongest selling point heading into his 2020 reelection bid is the state of the economy. Any threat to it could endanger Trump’s fragile approval ratings, especially among voters who say they are willing to overlook the president’s incendiary rhetoric provided they feel confident about their own financial security.

The administration is also urging the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates sharply, a move Trump has long sought in his public attacks on the central bank, and it is pursuing a trade deal with China amid various tariffs that some businesses say are posing substantial economic risks.

“The only thing they have in their control is China and putting out regulatory rules,” said one former senior administration official. “Beyond that, there is very little that they can do — but that does not mean people are not brainstorming options.”

Trump advisers concede that aides are feeling uneasy about the global economy’s effect on the U.S., as the president prepares to travel to a G-7 meeting in France this weekend.

“It is hard for us to grow when the rest of the world isn’t,” said Stephen Moore, a distinguished visiting fellow at the Heritage Foundation who Trump once considered for a spot on the Federal Reserve Board. “This has increased the administration’s desire to get a trade deal on China. That is key. Once you get a trade deal with China, it puts you back on the 3 percent growth path.”

The White House spent Tuesday selling its happy economic message. Top economic adviser Larry Kudlow hosted two calls with local and state officials and conservative groups to offer his own analysis and assurances, discussions that one White House official said had been planned for several weeks. Officials also reached out to business groups with a message that included stressing the stock market‘s resilience.

The president is intent on convincing voters that the economy is in fine shape because he knows voters often cast ballots based on how they feel at the time of the election about their own economic situation.

“People do not vote on numbers. They vote on whether they feel good, and the president understands that. He is selling the feeling,” a second White House adviser said. “It is like any other sales pitch: He is constantly trying to play off people’s feelings and emotions on the economy.”

He’s not the only one. Kudlow, counselor to the president Kellyanne Conway and deputy White House press secretary Hogan Gidley all appeared on TV over the past few days to deliver the administration’s upbeat, public-facing message, while Vice President Mike Pence spoke to the Detroit Economic Club on Monday to tout the administration’s record featuring low unemployment and healthy wage growth.

“Despite the irresponsible rhetoric of many in the mainstream media, the American economy is strong, and the U.S. economic outlook remains strong as well,” Pence said in Detroit. “Last week, despite some volatility in global markets, leading retailers also reported strong sales and earnings, and consumer spending posted its strongest reading since March.”

A recession is generally considered to be two straight quarters of economic contraction. While the U.S. is not experiencing a recession, given steady growth in jobs and wages, some common warning signs have emerged in financial markets including the inversion of a measure known as the yield curve, which can signal a downturn ahead.

Some parts of the economy have also suffered of late from weak business investment and Trump’s trade wars. On top of that, a federal deficit that is expected to exceed $1 trillion this year limits the administration’s options to cushion against a downturn.

Trump spent Tuesday stridently defending his administration’s trade standoff with China, which many economic experts and Republicans pinpoint as the main driver of any U.S. economic troubles.

“You should be happy that I'm fighting this battle, because somebody has to do it. We couldn't let this go. I don't even think it's sustainable to let go on what was happening,"" Trump told reporters as he detailed the way China steals U.S. intellectual property and argued none of his presidential predecessors were willing to confront China as he has.

“My life would be a lot easier if I didn't take China on. But I like doing it because I have to do it. And we're getting great help. China's had the worst year they've had in 27 years, and a lot of people saying the worst year they've had in 54 years,” he added.

If the economy weakens any further, the president has already lined up scapegoats including the media, Democrats and the man he appointed to lead the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, who Trump has been railing against for months.

The president appears to be setting up this collective group to take the blame if the economy falters on his watch.

“I think the word ‘recession’ is a word that's inappropriate because it's just a word that the — certain people; I'm going to be kind — certain people and the media, are trying to build up because they'd love to see a recession. We're very far from a recession,” the president said."

He continued, ""The Prime Minister was able to save a great deal of expense and effort for both the United States and Denmark by being so direct. I thank her for that and look forward to rescheduling sometime in the future!""

A White House official confirmed to CNN that the entire trip to Denmark is being scrapped.

Trump has on multiple occasions brought up buying Greenland from the Danish government and the White House counsel's office has looked into the possibility, two sources told CNN last week.

Trump tells NRA chief that universal background checks are off the table,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Tom Hamburger', 'Investigative Reporter Focused On The Intersection Of Money', 'Politics In Washington', 'Josh Dawsey', 'Reporter Covering The White House', 'August At Pm']",08-20-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-tells-nra-chief-that-universal-background-checks-are-off-the-table/2019/08/20/deae5b5a-c39a-11e9-9986-1fb3e4397be4_story.html,"National Rifle Association chief executive Wayne LaPierre meets with President Trump in the Roosevelt Room of the White House in Washington on Feb. 1, 2017. (Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP/file)

President Trump talked Tuesday with National Rifle Association chief executive Wayne LaPierre and assured him that universal background checks were off the table, according to several people familiar with the call.

Trump told LaPierre that the White House remained interested in proposals that would address weapons getting into the hands of the mentally ill, including the possibility of backing so-called “red flag” laws that would allow the police to temporarily confiscate guns from people who have been shown to be a danger to themselves or others.

Nonetheless, the president’s conversation with LaPierre, which was first reported by the Atlantic, further reduced hopes that major new gun-safety measures will be enacted after the latest round of mass shootings.

“I know the gun lobby is putting the full-court press on everyone surrounding the president,” said Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) who said he was hoping for a process to be set up this week to move forward on a bipartisan backgrounds check bill. “I have not received any different signal than I got last week,” he said.

[Renewed calls for gun control after dual massacres test a deeply divided NRA]

But while the president was in Bedminster, N.J., last week, NRA officials repeatedly talked to him, according to people familiar with those conversations. It seems the conversations were effective, which may further fuel public anger on the topic.

“Every time he raises expectations, then he clearly and publicly walks away from the commitments he made, it makes the lives of Republicans more miserable,” Murphy said.

A spokesman for another Democratic senator advocating background checks, Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.) said he has not been told to stand down by the White House.

In the days after the shootings in El Paso and Dayton, Ohio, Trump inspired hope among gun-control advocates by noting “there is a great appetite” for tightening background checks on people who buy firearms.

Federal legislation mandating background checks has been opposed by the NRA in the past. After the latest shootings, officials across the country called for expanding background checks to cover all gun buyers, including those making purchases at gun shows. With the NRA in some disarray following complaints of mismanagement, there was some hope among gun-control advocates that Trump might defy the politically powerful organization.

In the past, Trump has mocked lawmakers as fearful of the NRA, but he has also repeatedly lavished praise on the organization, whose political arm spent $30 million to help elect him. The president tweeted support for the NRA nearly a dozen times since early last year, most recently lamenting that “our great NRA” is a “victim of harassment” by the New York attorney general, which is investigating the tax-exempt group’s spending.

After hearing from NRA leaders over the past week, the president stopped talking about instituting such checks, emphasizing instead the need to keep guns away from people who are mentally disturbed. He noted in recent days that the country already has “very strong background checks,” a position that aligns with that of the NRA leadership.

Tuesday’s call with LaPierre, which was initiated by Trump, lasted 45 minutes and by the end of it, the two men had no disagreements, the people familiar with the call said. The president seemed more focused on funding for mental health programs and other topics of interest to the NRA, the people said.

For his part, LaPierre seemed pleased with his conversation with Trump, tweeting about it late Tuesday.

“I spoke to the president today,” he wrote. “We discussed the best ways to prevent these types of tragedies. President Trump is a strong 2A President and supports our Right to Keep and Bear Arms!”

Pompeo announces 'countdown' clock as Iran weapons embargo ends in 2020,https://www.cnn.com,"['Joshua Berlinger', 'Kylie Atwood', 'Jennifer Hansler']",08-20-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/20/middleeast/iran-united-states-intl-hnk/index.html,"(CNN) United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has warned against ending an arms embargo on Iran, likening every day until the deal's October 2020 expiration as a ""#CountdownToTerror.""

The push to extend the ban on weapons sales to Tehran comes amid increasing efforts by Washington to restrict Iran's oil exports. Since the decision by US President Donald Trump in 2018 to abandon the Iran nuclear deal , Washington has attempted to use what it calls ""maximum pressure"" to change Iran's behavior and limit its nuclear ambitions.

""Time is drawing short to continue this activity of restricting Iran's capacity to foment its terror regime. The international community will have plenty of time to see how long it has until Iran is unshackled to create new turmoil, and figure out what it must do to prevent this from happening,"" Pompeo said Tuesday, during an address at the United Nations.

Also on Tuesday, the State Department released what Pompeo termed a ""#CountdownToTerror clock"" tracking the time until the arms embargo and a travel ban on Qasem Soleimani expire next year. Soleimani commands Iran's Quds force , which is responsible for the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps' overseas activities.

The arms embargo covers all weapons sales and ""related material"" to Iran. It was put in place by the UN and is set to be lifted five years after the adoption of the nuclear deal.

The @UN arms embargo on #Iran and the travel ban on Qasem Soleimani expire in October 2020. Our #CountdownToTerror clock is tracking how long until Iran is unleashed to create new global turmoil. We must not let his happen. https://t.co/4UtnMREgah

Speaking to reporters Tuesday, Pompeo warned the international community against helping ships that are believed to be carrying illicit crude oil from Iran in breach of US sanctions.

Pompeo's comments followed reports that an Iranian tanker called the Bonita Queen was headed to Syria to deliver crude oil.

""We've made clear anyone who touches it, anyone who supports it, anyone who allows a ship to dock, is at risk of receiving sanctions from the United States of America. So if that ship again heads to Syria, we'll take every action we can consistent with those sanctions to prevent them,"" Pompeo said.

A source at the company Tanker Tracker, which tracks top oil exports based on satellite technology, said that the Bonita Queen was sailing toward Syria carrying about 600,000 barrels of oil. The source said Syria illegally receives about 3 million barrels of crude oil a month shipped from abroad.

The Bonita Queen does not fly the Iranian flag, but it is managed by the same company as a tanker now called the Adrian Darya 1, formerly known as the Grace 1.

The Adrian Darya 1 was impounded last month by the UK in Gibraltar on suspicion that it was attempting to carry oil to Syria, in breach of European Union sanctions. The ship was released Sunday , shortly after the United States issued a warrant for its seizure Friday in what appeared to be a last-ditch attempt to stop the tanker.

Iran has maintained that it is not seeking a confrontation and the US actions are tantamount to bullying.

""Iran is not interested in confrontation. We were not the ones who walked away from a carefully negotiated agreement, an agreement that was not exactly what we wanted and certainly not exactly what the US wanted, or Europeans wanted or for that matter not exactly what China and Russia wanted,"" Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said Tuesday, referring to the nuclear deal."
Former VA physician charged with the deaths of three veterans,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Lisa Rein', 'Reporter Covering Federal Agencies', 'The Management Of Government In The Trump Administration', 'August At Pm']",08-20-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/former-va-physician-charged-with-the-deaths-of-three-veterans/2019/08/20/0119ea16-c345-11e9-9986-1fb3e4397be4_story.html,"Federal prosecutors on Tuesday charged a former Veterans Affairs pathologist with the deaths of three veterans and a scheme to cover up years of drug and alcohol use on the job that caused him to misread thousands of fluid and tissue samples of ill patients.

Robert Morris Levy was indicted on three counts of involuntary manslaughter and 28 counts of mail fraud, wire fraud and false statements to law enforcement officials. The Department of Veterans Affairs has told members of Congress and investigators that Levy’s misdiagnoses, which amounted to more than 3,000 cases, were responsible for at least 15 deaths.

During 12 years as chief pathologist here and in leadership roles on multiple oversight boards and medical committees, Levy, 53, read almost 34,000 pa­thol­ogy slides from aging veterans. He had their lives in his hands, prosecutors said in unsealing their indictment.

But his addiction and attempts to cover it up with lies and dangerous practices — even after VA paid for a lengthy inpatient treatment program — led to multiple deaths and other life-threatening trauma for veterans, they said.

“I don’t think anyone would ever have imagined that a pathologist would use his knowledge and expertise in order to do something like this,” Duane Kees, the U.S. attorney for the Western District of Arkansas, said at a news conference after unsealing the criminal indictment.

The charges unsealed Tuesday mark a rare criminal case against a physician, in or out of government, in a profession where mistakes or incidents of negligence are most often addressed in civil court through malpractice claims, authorities said.

VA officials on Tuesday called Levy’s alleged misdeeds an isolated case. But they are already prompting a reckoning and questions of oversight from investigators, veterans groups and Congress for the country’s largest medical system — a sprawling, decentralized network of 1,200 hospitals and smaller clinics that serve 9 million veterans a year.

Kees, a veteran, said he brought a limited number of manslaughter charges “in order to bring the most serious and prosecutable case.”

VA Inspector General Michael Missal, whose office in 2018 began an investigation of Levy’s actions and of agency missteps in overseeing and addressing his behavior, said Levy betrayed veterans’ most basic trust.

“When veterans go to VA for their health care, they expect to be helped and not harmed,” said Missal, whose office brought the criminal case with Kees.

To avoid detection of his severe substance abuse problem, Levy used his knowledge of toxicology and the science of blood testing and urinalysis to devise a dangerous solution, prosecutors alleged.

Levy routinely took a substance called 2-methyl-2-butanol (known as 2M2B) to mask the alcohol level in his blood. The substance, not approved for individual use, cannot be detected in routine tests for drugs and alcohol. And it can be lethal if too much is taken, Kees said.

In this way, Levy intentionally misled the Mississippi state medical license board into believing that he was clean, the indictment said.

“He knew exactly how much to use for it not to be fatal,” Kees said.

Levy, an Air Force veteran whose VA salary was $225,000 a year, was fired from VA last year.

[VA is gearing up for a massive shift of health care to the private sector. But Democrats are fighting back.]

Levy’s diagnoses and the information he entered in patients’ medical records “largely influenced decisions about their course of treatment,” prosecutors said. From 2005 to 2017, Levy read slides and assisted radiologists, surgeons and other physicians during procedures called “needle biopsies,” rendering clinical diagnoses for about 24,000 veterans.

They were patients from rural and often low-income communities of northwest Arkansas, southwest Missouri and eastern Oklahoma. Levy did not treat veterans in person, working in his pa­thol­ogy lab on the third floor of Specialty Building 21 in the back of a medical center’s campus.

He was tasked with a crucial medical role — diagnosing cancer and other diseases in aging veterans who fought in World War II, Korea, Vietnam, the Gulf War, Iraq and Afghanistan, and those who served but did not see combat.

Many of these veterans rely solely on VA for their medical care, lacking private insurance.

An 18-month review of Levy’s cases found that almost 10 percent of his diagnoses involved clinical errors, more than 10 times the normal misdiagnosis rate of 0.7 percent for pathologists.

Hundreds of the misdiagnoses were not serious, VA officials said. But the mistakes led to at least 15 deaths, authorities said, and other serious illnesses for veterans whose cancers or other illnesses were not diagnosed or were diagnosed when they should not have been, leading to unnecessary treatment.

Levy, appearing at his arraignment Tuesday in a federal courtroom in a gray striped prison jumpsuit, pleaded not guilty. He awaited his turn on a crowded docket, slouched over and solemn, his hands shaking from time to time. Occasionally he glanced to the bank of prosecutors and investigators seated in the room.

Levy stood out: The other defendants, most facing drug charges, told the judge they had completed high school. When asked for his level of education, the pathologist, trained at UCLA and Emory University with a sub-specialty in hematopathology, responded, “MD.”

Levy told Judge Erin Wiedemann he had secured an attorney only Monday. She set a trial date for Oct. 7, and Levy was returned by a U.S. marshal to the county jail in Fayetteville, where he has been since his arrest late last week.

Prosecutors described a sinister disregard for veterans’ lives as Levy knowingly entered false diagnoses for three veterans whose biopsies he read, one in 2009 and two in 2014.

One patient wrongly diagnosed with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, a type of cancer he did not have, received the wrong treatment and died in months. Another patient died of squamous cell carcinoma that spread after Levy entered a wrong diagnosis of small-cell carcinoma in his record.

The third patient received a benign test result for prostate cancer and as a result was not treated; he died in 2016 after the disease spread.

In two of the cases, Levy falsified records to claim that his deputy had concurred with his diagnosis, a required peer review for first-time malignancy cases.

VA fired Levy last year after an arrest for driving under the influence. But his termination followed a tumultuous tenure, particularly in recent years, during which his colleagues in the pa­thol­ogy lab complained that they witnessed erratic behavior from him while on the job. Their complaints went unheeded, the indictment alleges.

Following an incident of erratic behavior, Levy entered a VA program for impaired physicians in Mississippi in 2016 and returned to work. But a year later he appeared at a meeting of fellow pathologists and oncologists that he was chairing and was unable to stand and slurred his words, according to documents and interviews.

His medical privileges were suspended, but he continued to perform administrative work until the DUI arrest and was fired in April 2018.

[Whistleblower says there’s a secret VA wait list for care. The department says that’s not true.]

At the heart of the case, say investigators, former employees and VA patients in northwest Arkansas interviewed by The Washington Post, is how years of missed diagnoses, many of them of fatal diseases, went undetected and why distress calls from employees went unheeded.

VA has long struggled with issues of access to patient care and whether its physicians are vetted carefully enough for misconduct and mistakes that could endanger patients, when they are hired or on the job. Some said Levy’s impaired behavior on the job was well known for years but little was done to stop him.

Rep. Bruce Westerman (R-Ark.), who with his colleagues in Arkansas’s delegation to Congress has aggressively monitored VA’s outreach to veterans affected by the case, said he is furious at what he described as a “lack of oversight.”

“Of all the medical professionals, the person you really don’t want messing up is a pathologist,” Westerman said in an interview. “There were poor procedures in place, or they weren’t followed like they should have been. Levy had a record of being impaired on the job and continued to evaluate cases.”

In a statement before Levy was charged, Kelvin Parks, director of the Fayetteville VA medical center, offered his “sincerest apology to the Veterans and family members negatively impacted by this now-fired former employee.”

“In instances where his conduct did not meet the high standards Veterans and taxpayers expect from us, we are holding ourselves accountable, letting Veterans and families know their options and keeping the community informed,” the statement said.

Darren O’Quinn, a Little Rock attorney and pharmacist retained by Levy to represent him, said in an interview that he is advising Levy on a legal strategy and was driving to Fayetteville late Tuesday to meet with his client.

A VA spokeswoman, Jessica Jacobsen, called the case “an isolated incident” in an email and said the agency has “strengthened internal controls” to ensure that errors are “more quickly” identified and addressed. She declined to describe the changes.

Parks has said there was a “vulnerability” in the internal case review process that sometimes allowed supervisors to review their own cases. He said the hospital now will have someone from the quality-control department manage and oversee all case reviews."
USDA cuts payments promised to researchers as agency uproots to Kansas City,https://thehill.com,[],08-20-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/458129-usda-cuts-payments-promised-to-researchers-as-agency-uproots-to,"A union for employees at the research wings of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) says the agency has reneged on payments promised to employees, rolling back assistance to those who will be forced out of the agency if they do not agree to move to the Kansas City area.

“Due to the volume of applications and in an effort to afford all employees who applied the opportunity to receive the incentive payment, the amount approved for all applicants has changed from $25,000 to $10,000,” the USDA wrote on a form for employees applying for the assistance.

USDA announced in June that it would be moving its two research agencies to Kansas City.

Employees at both the Economic Research Service (ERS) and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) unionized in the wake of the agency's relocation plans, and the USDA has been heavily criticized by lawmakers for the short timeline and chaos surrounding the decision.

Two-thirds of staff at the two agencies said they would face termination from the agency rather than uproot.

Those departing employees were expecting buyouts of $25,000, only to learn from the USDA that they’d be reducing the payout in light of the number of employees fleeing the agency.

“Employees now have less than a week to decide whether to accept the reduced buyout, which also bars them for working at another federal agency for five years. Many of these employees have spent their careers devoted to agricultural research and furthering their agencies’ missions, and they deserve to be treated better than this,” American Federation of Government Employees President J. David Cox Sr. said in a statement. “It’s hard to imagine USDA management finding more ways to demoralize the workers at these two agencies, yet they continue to top themselves at every turn.”

USDA did not agree with the union's contention that the payments were promised. The department is not required to offer Voluntary Separation Incentive Payments (VSIP) nor must the payments be a certain amount, a spokesperson said.

The agency attributed the change in the payment to an effort to make sure all employees would be able to get a payout.

“In keeping consistent with the Secretary’s commitment to “Do Right” by our employees, the Department’s priority was to offer a standard VSIP to every eligible employee who applied, instead of on a first come first serve basis,” an agency spokesperson said in an email to The Hill. “The Department has made it a priority to treat all employees fairly and consistently, and offering VSIP to every employee who applied aligns with that commitment and ensures all eligible employees have access to available options.""

The agency has previously said the move is designed to move employees closer to stakeholders — an argument ERS and NIFA employees say makes no sense as they work primarily with lawmakers and universities across the country.

The agency has been heavily criticized for poor planning tied to the move.

Numerous lawmakers have spoken out against USDA’s plans, viewing it as a brain drain that would harm the agencies' missions.

Trump Expected to Nominate Pompeo Deputy to Be Ambassador to Russia,https://www.nytimes.com,"['Maggie Haberman', 'Michael Crowley']",08-20-2019,2019,8,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/20/us/politics/john-sullivan-trump-russia-ambassador.html,"At his 2017 Senate confirmation hearing, Mr. Sullivan took a tough line toward Russia’s 2016 election interference and aggression toward its neighbors, such as its annexation of the Crimean Peninsula in 2014.

“I believe we have to be robust in our response to this intrusion into our democracy,” he said. “Interference with our political processes is simply unacceptable. It’s a profound threat to our way of life, and we have to respond as robustly as possible with all the means we have at our disposal.”

Russia has not been a central part of Mr. Sullivan’s portfolio, but last month he led a delegation of Trump administration officials who met with his Russian counterpart, Sergei A. Ryabkov, in Geneva to discuss arms control and other security issues. In December, Mr. Sullivan toured Central and Eastern Europe, where he pressed officials on Russia’s “destabilizing” and “malign activities,” according to a State Department news release about the trip.

As ambassador since October 2017, Mr. Huntsman maintained a low profile in Moscow. But he made quiet, if largely futile, efforts to thaw relations between Washington and Moscow before submitting his resignation this month. It is effective on Oct. 3.

During a meeting on June 28 with Mr. Putin at the Group of 20 summit in Osaka, Japan, Mr. Trump spoke in warm terms about the Russian leader. “We have had a very, very good relationship,” he said. “A lot of very positive things going to come out of the relationship.”

Although the report by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, did not find that Mr. Trump’s 2016 campaign had conspired with the Kremlin, members of both parties in Congress are determined to maintain stiff sanctions on Moscow over its election interference detailed by Mr. Mueller and for Russia’s annexation of Crimea.

Mr. Sestanovich said that Mr. Putin’s government is frustrated by the continued hostility it faces in Washington, as well as by mixed signals from Mr. Trump’s own administration, where Russia hawks have resisted the president’s efforts to improve relations. He said the Kremlin is likely resigned to regrouping after the 2020 presidential election and waiting out the remainder of Mr. Trump’s administration, if needed."
US must re-seize Iran's illicit oil vessel,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],08-19-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/us-must-re-seize-irans-illicit-oil-vessel,"President Trump should direct the U.S. military to re-seize an Iranian oil tanker released from British custody this weekend.

The tanker, Grace 1, now renamed Adrian Darya 1, was seized by the British Royal Navy in July for attempting to transport more than $100 million in oil to Syria. That transportation breached European Union sanctions on the Syrian regime. Unfortunately, last weekend, the British government released the tanker from its Gibraltar territory. It said Iran had provided assurances that the oil will no longer go to Assad. Maritime tracking websites show the Adrian Darya 1 now en-route to the Greek port of Kalamata.

But Iran cannot be trusted here.

A U.S. indictment against Adrian Darya 1 attests that Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps has used the vessel to illicitly and covertly transport oil across the globe. The revenue generated by those sales has then filled IRGC coffers, enabling its conduct of hostile activity. The indictment also clarifies how Iran has sought to conceal the vessel's purpose and destination, even engaging in at-sea ship-to-ship transfers. This is sanctions-busting 101.

It is highly likely that at some point over the next few weeks the Iranians will again attempt to offload the vessel's oil in furtherance of new revenue generation. But the now-unsealed indictment means U.S. credibility is also now tied to Adrian Darya 1's future. Were the U.S. to thus allow the Adrian Darya 1 to offload its oil cargo, the IRGC would regard their success as testifying to American weakness. That cannot be allowed to happen.

This isn't about posturing, it's about holding firm to a policy that is paying dividends. The Trump administration has successfully balanced an interest in avoiding conflict with Iran with pressuring Iran's return to negotiations over its nuclear program. That requires a balancing act between avoiding unnecessary escalation while also deterring the IRGC-aligned Iranian hardliner faction. But if the IRGC sees that the U.S. is cowed by its threats not to intervene against the Adrian Darya 1, it will be encouraged to the belief that Trump is hesitant to challenge Iranian breaches of his aggression. In turn, it will also have better opportunity to undercut escalating efforts by more-moderate Iranian figures to seek a compromise with the United States.

Why, the hardliners will say, should we compromise when we can test American resolve and find it wanting?

Trump must send the U.S. Navy into action."
Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan expected to be selected for US ambassador to Russia,https://www.cnn.com,"['Jim Acosta', 'Caroline Kelly', 'Kylie Atwood']",08-20-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/20/politics/john-sullivan-us-ambassador-to-russia/index.html,"(CNN) President Donald Trump is expected to select Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan to replace Jon Huntsman as US Ambassador to Russia , according to a White House official.

CNN reported earlier this month that Huntsman has submitted his resignation letter to Trump and plans to move back home to Utah, according to a source familiar with his thinking.

Sullivan was a partner at Mayer Brown in Washington and co-chaired the law firm's national security practice before being nominated as former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson's deputy in April 2017. He previously served as chairman of the United States-Iraq Business Dialogue, a government advisory committee that dealt with US-Iraq economic relations.

Sullivan also held senior positions at the Justice, Defense and Commerce departments, including as deputy secretary and general counsel at Commerce, deputy general counsel at Defense and counselor to Assistant Attorney General J. Michael Luttig.

Trump told reporters on Tuesday that Sullivan ""very well could be"" the next US ambassador to Russia.

""He's somebody that's being put up and respected. To Russia? Yeah. Very respected,"" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office when asked if Sullivan is his pick to replace Huntsman.

""Well I know that (Secretary of State) Mike Pompeo likes him very much and he's very respected. He could very well be, yeah,"" Trump continued.

However, two sources tell CNN that Sullivan is well-liked at the State Department but is not inside Pompeo's inner circle.

Sullivan has often felt out of the loop and wanted a new post. Despite having little experience when it comes to Russia, Sullivan lobbied to get this job and Pompeo and national security adviser John Bolton ended up supporting him.

The sources said Pompeo and Bolton recognize that the US ambassador to Russia is a challenging role, but not one that holds a lot of significance in this administration.

Sullivan has defended the President's strategy in Russia, telling CNN's Christiane Amanpour last year before Trump's visit with Russian President Vladimir Putin that Trump wanted ""to engage with"" the Russian president.

""But our purpose is not to engage for purposes of surrendering our principles,"" Sullivan said. ""The President's purpose is to engage with President Putin, so that we can discuss these important issues, whether it's Eastern Ukraine, Crimea, arms control, Syria. There are so many issues on which we need to engage with the Russians and have been.""

Sullivan has very little experience when it comes to Russia. He led the US delegation that met with Russian officials last month in Geneva on arms control. He impressed State Department officials on that trip who called him a quick learn when it came to the highly technical nature of arms control.

During his first year as deputy, Sullivan also pushed back against ""twisted"" reports of deep unhappiness with Tillerson in the face of a redesign and looming cuts that could slash the country's oldest Cabinet agency by as much as 30%.

Huntsman's resignation is effective October 3 and there is some speculation that he is planning to run for governor of Utah, a role he previous served in from 2005 to 2009. However, a source close to Huntsman told CNN that decision is still up in the air, saying, ""We shall see, it's been a long two years.""

Special Representative to North Korea Steve Biegun, who was also on the short list for the Russia ambassador job, stayed on the DPRK portfolio given the escalating tension between the US and North Korea."
DOJ to Supreme Court: Trump decision to end DACA was lawful,https://thehill.com,[],08-20-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/latino/458102-doj-to-supreme-court-trump-decision-to-end-daca-was-lawful,"In a late-night filing ahead of a case scheduled for oral arguments in November, Solicitor General Noel Francisco argued the Trump administration had the legal authority to rescind DACA in 2017.

The case under review by the Supreme Court is about the legality of the president's order to end DACA, not the legality of the Obama-era program that allows hundreds of thousands of so-called Dreamers — undocumented immigrants who arrived in the country as minors — to temporarily live and work in the United States without risk of deportation. ""At best, DACA is legally questionable; at worst, it is illegal,"" wrote Francisco.The case under review by the Supreme Court is about the legality of the president's order to end DACA, not the legality of the Obama-era program that allows hundreds of thousands of so-called Dreamers — undocumented immigrants who arrived in the country as minors — to temporarily live and work in the United States without risk of deportation.

The court is likely to issue its decision in the case in June or July, just months ahead of the presidential election. The final ruling could have profound implications for the 2020 race and thrust immigration back into the spotlight as a central campaign issue.



Trump in 2017 prompted litigation with his order to strip the benefits granted to Dreamers by his predecessor.

That order was blocked by federal judges, and the 9th Circuit affirmed those decisions on the grounds that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) enacted Trump's rescission of DACA based solely on ""a belief that DACA was unlawful."""
Former US attorney expects 'blockbuster' FISA abuse report from DOJ inspector general,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],08-19-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/former-us-attorney-expects-blockbuster-fisa-abuse-report-from-doj-inspector-general,"Former U.S. Attorney Guy Lewis predicted the Justice Department inspector general's report on alleged Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act abuses will be ""hard-hitting,"" with multiple recommendations for prosecution.

During an interview Monday on Fox News, Lewis said he used to work with Inspector General Michael Horowitz at the Justice Department and called him as ""tough as a nail."" Lewis added, ""He’s tough, he is smart, and I think the report will be a blockbuster."" He expects Horowitz's findings to make special counsel Robert Mueller's report on Russian interference in the 2016 election ""look like a sixth grade book report.""

Asked to explain why, Lewis said, ""It’s going to come out. It’s going to be hard-hitting. [Horowitz] spent almost two years interviewing various people — witnesses. Looking at what he describes [as] almost a million documents. And I think he’s going to make recommendations regarding prosecution and turn this whole FISA — this Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act — the submissions, I think he will turn them on their head.""

British ex-spy Christopher Steele's anti-Trump dossier, which was funded by the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee, was used by the FBI to obtain FISA warrants to surveil one-time Trump campaign adviser Carter Page, an American citizen who was never charged with any wrongdoing.

Republicans have argued the dossier's Democratic benefactors and its author's anti-Trump bias were left out of the FISA applications and have demanded accountability. Democrats countered that the FBI acted appropriately, saying the Justice Department and the FBI met the rigor, transparency, and evidentiary basis for probable cause.

[Analysis: Who and what the Horowitz report is likely to cover]

Although some Trump allies have expressed high expectations for Horowitz's report and Attorney General William Barr's review of the origins of the Russia investigation, others are preaching caution. ""Republicans usually set the bar so high that when we don't meet it, the media narrative then becomes Republicans don't even own their promises. Just promise a fair investigation that goes wherever the facts take us,"" former South Carolina Rep. Trey Gowdy said on Fox News last month.

Lewis, who served with Barr at the Justice Department under President George H.W. Bush, was reacting to an interview Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham did over the weekend in which he said he believes the IG report would be “ugly and damning” for the DOJ and its handling of the Russia investigation.

Graham said he wants ""as much as possible"" declassified from Horowitz's report as possible, but former New Hampshire Gov. John Sununu warned former FBI Director Christopher Wray might fight to keep its contents classified because he has been ""co-opted by the FBI bureaucracy.""

Lewis said he does not agree with Sununu's assessment, calling Wray a ""good, honest broker,"" but advised the FBI chief to ""err on the side of transparency"" because he suspects the FISA Court may have been used by the FBI to target President Trump's 2016 campaign.

Asked where the investigation is headed, Lewis said former FBI officials Peter Strzok and Andrew McCabe ought to be ""worried"" about submissions that were made to the FISA Court. Both Strzok and McCabe filed separate lawsuits against the DOJ and FBI claiming they were subject to politically motivated firings last year.

He also said former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos and former national security adviser Michael Flynn should be be ""sort of happy"" because Horowitz's report might be used to help them overturn their convictions, stemming from Mueller's investigation, for lying to FBI investigators."
State AGs prepare antitrust investigation into tech firms,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],08-20-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/state-ags-prepare-antitrust-investigation-into-tech-firms,"The top law enforcement officers in several states are gearing up to launch an antitrust investigation of Silicon Valley’s biggest firms, according to multiple reports, adding to the scrutiny tech companies are already facing from federal regulators.

The investigation is expected to get off the ground as soon as next month and would follow a meeting representatives from states had with antitrust officials from the Justice Department last month.

A group of state attorneys general plan to soon issue civil investigative demands to the tech companies, and the investigation will examine whether Silicon Valley’s most powerful firms suppressed competition in the tech industry.

It’s unclear how many states are expected to participate and whether it will be a bipartisan group, but the Wall Street Journal reported as many as 20 attorneys general could join the effort.

After last month’s meeting at the Justice Department, the office of Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, said a group of eight state attorneys general met with Attorney General William Barr to discuss “the real concerns consumers across the country have with big tech companies stifling competition on the internet.”

Paxton’s office said the states are “considering a range of possible antitrust actions against such companies.”

An investigation into big tech companies spearheaded by the states would run alongside investigations launched by the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission into anticompetitive behavior by leading internet companies.

The Justice Department said last month it had opened a sweeping antitrust review into “market-leading online platforms,” which is likely to include Amazon, Facebook, and Google. The Federal Trade Commission launched a technology task force in February designed to monitor competition in the tech sector and investigate any possible anticompetitive conduct.

The commission also opened an antitrust investigation into Facebook, the social media company acknowledged in financial filings last month.

The inquiries from the federal government come alongside continued efforts in Congress to examine the practices of some of the country’s biggest technology companies.

To address the growing dominance of Silicon Valley firms and whether they have shut smaller competitors out of the marketplace, 2020 Democratic presidential contender Elizabeth Warren called for breaking up the Facebook, Amazon, and Google, while Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, has proposed antitrust action against big tech companies."

The Democratic-led House Ways and Means Committee on Tuesday filed a motion in federal court in Washington, D.C., for summary judgment, asking Judge Trevor McFadden to direct Treasury and the IRS to comply with the committee's requests and subpoenas for six years of the president's federal tax returns.

The committee also asked McFadden, a Trump appointee, to consider the case on an expedited basis, proposing a schedule under which briefs on relevant issues would be filed by Oct. 25 with oral arguments taking place ""as soon as practicable"" after that.

In its own court filing Tuesday, Treasury and the IRS asked that the committee's summary judgment motion be put on hold until after McFadden resolves the administration's own forthcoming motion to dismiss the House lawsuit.

In arguing on Tuesday that the judge should direct the administration to provide the tax returns, the committee said that the ""defendants’ defiance is an extraordinary departure from established principles of law.""

The committee said that its subpoenas are valid, and that the section of the tax code under which it requested Trump's tax returns doesn't give Treasury and the IRS any discretion.

Treasury has said that it thinks the committee's requests and subpoenas for Trump's tax returns lack a ""legitimate legislative purpose,"" and that Democrats' real purpose for seeking the documents is to expose the tax information of a political rival.

But the committee argues its requests and subpoenas do have a legitimate legislative purpose, because the panel is conducting oversight and considering legislative proposals relating to how the IRS enforces tax laws against a president.

The committee revealed in its new court filings that on July 29, it received an unsolicited communication from a federal employee it claims made credible allegations of possibly inappropriate efforts to influence the IRS's mandatory audit program of presidents.

Mnuchin replied that the Treasury didn't have any records that were covered under the tax code section under which Neal made his request. Mnuchin also said that Neal should raise his concerns with the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration.

The administration argued that it plans to file a motion to dismiss the case that will raise issues about ""whether political conflicts between the elected Branches fall within the sphere of authority that the Constitution assigns to the Federal courts."" It asked McFadden to stay the committee's motion until the judge rules on its motion to dismiss.

The administration argued that its motion and the committee's motion will require the court to consider different issues. The administration is proposing a schedule under which oral arguments on its motion to dismiss would be held the week of Oct. 16 or soon after that.

But the committee, which argued that it has standing to sue, thinks that the judge should consider the administration's expected motion to dismiss and the panel's summary judgment motion concurrently, arguing the motions are likely to raise overlapping issues.

The House panel argued that ""time is of the essence"" in resolving the case, since the current Congress will end in January 2021.

""The Committee must obtain a prompt resolution of the issues in this case if it is to have enough time to investigate the tax issues implicated by President Trump’s tax returns and return information and propose and pass any legislation that it may deem appropriate in response,"" the panel argued.

The administration, however, said that the committee's concern about the speed of the case ""rings hollow,"" since Neal didn't request Trump's tax returns until several months after he became chairman, and the lawsuit wasn't filed until weeks after Treasury and the IRS rejected Neal's subpoenas.

Trump and several of his business entities also are being heard in the case as defendant-intervenors. They argued on Tuesday that the committee's motion for summary judgment should be postponed until after they can request information about Democrats' true motives for requesting Trump's tax returns.

The U.S. State Department has approved a possible $8 billion sale of F-16 fighter jets to Taiwan, the Defense Security Cooperation Agency said on Tuesday in an official notification to Congress.

The potential deal is for 66 aircraft, 75 General Electric engines, as well as other systems, the agency said in a statement, adding it served the interests of the United States and would help Taiwan maintain a credible defense.

China has already denounced the widely discussed sale, one of the biggest yet by the United States to Taiwan, which Beijing considers a renegade province. It has warned of unspecified ""countermeasures.""

Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Jim Risch, a Republican, has welcomed the proposed sale of the Lockheed Martin Corp F-16 jets.

""These fighters are critical to improving Taiwan's ability to defend its sovereign airspace, which is under increasing pressure from the People's Republic of China,"" he said in a recent statement.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told Fox News on Monday that President Donald Trump notified Congress of the sale last week.

Pompeo told Fox News the sale was ""consistent with past U.S. policy"" and that the United States was ""simply following through on the commitments we've made to all of the parties.""

In Taipei, President Tsai Ing-wen said the sale would help Taiwan build a new air force and boost its air defense capacity.

In a post on Facebook, Tsai said she was grateful for Washington's ""continuous support for Taiwan's national defense"".

""With strong self-defense capacity, Taiwan will certainly be more confident to ensure the cross-strait and regional peace and stability while facing security challenges,"" she said.

Taiwan unveiled its largest defense spending increase in more than a decade last week, amid rising military tensions with China."

In a legal brief submitted to the court, the lawyers asserted that the president was fully within his rights to eliminate the program, known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, and said the lower courts were mistaken when they said Mr. Trump’s action almost two years ago was arbitrary.

The Department of Homeland Security “correctly, and at a minimum reasonably, concluded that DACA is unlawful,” the lawyers argued, disputing the conclusions by the lower court judges about the three reasons the administration gave for ending the program. “None of those three grounds is remotely arbitrary or capricious, let alone all three.”

The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear arguments about the fate of the program in November. The justices could decide the case next spring or summer, just as the presidential election campaign is in full swing."

The 6 things you most need to know about Trump’s new climate plan,https://www.vox.com,['Aug'],08-19-2019,2019,8,https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2019/8/19/20812243/trump-epa-climate-plan-ace-cpp-6-things,"In June, the Trump administration unveiled its proposed replacement for the Clean Power Plan, Obama’s program to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from existing power plants. Last week, a coalition of 29 states and cities filed a lawsuit to block the rule, claiming that it violates Trump’s obligations under the Clean Air Act.

And on Sunday, nonpartisan research firm Resources for the Future, along with researchers from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, Syracuse University, and the Boston University School of Public Health, released new research showing that even Environmental Protection Agency’s meager projected pollution reductions from its rule are likely overestimated.

The story of EPA carbon regulations is long and tangled, but if you’re in a hurry, here’s the short version: The president’s plan is the bare minimum the EPA thinks it can get away with. It won’t reduce emissions much; in fact, it is likely to increase both carbon dioxide and local air pollutants, along with their health impacts, in more than a dozen states. (Seriously.) And the EPA is going to have a hell of a time justifying it to a court.

Now let’s walk through the longer version of the story. Most coverage so far has focused on the plan’s striking weakness (for obvious reasons), but there are several other aspects of the fight over power plant emissions that are worth understanding. How these policy and legal questions get resolved will have enormous influence on what the next administration — if we ever make it to another administration — can do to address climate change.

So, with that in mind, here are the six things you need to know about Trump’s Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) plan.

1) Trump’s EPA is regulating carbon because it has to, not because it wants to

The Trump administration has repeatedly expressed skepticism toward climate change, hostility toward regulation, and an all-consuming hatred for anything with former President Barack Obama’s fingerprints on it. If it had its druthers, it wouldn’t regulate carbon emissions at all.

But it has to. In 2007’s Massachusetts v. EPA, the Supreme Court ruled that if the EPA finds that greenhouse gases are a threat to public health, it must regulate them as air pollutants under the Clean Air Act. In 2009’s Endangerment Finding, the EPA found that, yes, greenhouse gases are a danger to public health.

Those twin developments created a set of legal obligations for the agency. It must:

regulate mobile sources of greenhouse gases, i.e., vehicles — that was Obama’s fuel economy standards, which Trump is busy gutting;

regulate new stationary sources of greenhouse gases, i.e., power plants and refineries — that was Obama’s 2013 limits on new sources, which Trump is busy gutting;

regulate existing stationary sources of greenhouse gases — that was the Clean Power Plan (CPP), which Trump is now gutting.

Some of the wackier denialists in the conservative coalition were pressing the EPA to challenge the endangerment finding (and former Administrator Scott Pruitt considered it). If successful, that would negate all these obligations. But, perhaps perceiving how futile and silly such an effort would be, the EPA elected not to.

So it was forced to replace, not just cancel, Obama’s fuel economy standards, replace, not just cancel, Obama’s regulations on new power plants, and replace, not just cancel, the Clean Power Plan. Thus, ACE.

2) The legal question at the heart of the dispute over CPP has never been decided by courts

The Clean Air Act (specifically, Section 111) calls upon the EPA to set air pollution standards by determining “the degree of emission limitation achievable through the application of the best system of emission reduction … adequately demonstrated.”

Just what constitutes the “best system of emission reduction” is at the heart of the dispute between CPP proponents (environmentalists and Democrats) and critics (polluting industries and Republicans).

After studying the issue for several years, Obama’s EPA realized a few things. First, power plants do not operate in isolation; they are parts of a large, interconnected grid, a single machine, and their operations are determined by its needs. And second, states are already busy reducing greenhouse gas emissions using a variety of policy tools connected to grid operations — fuel-switching from coal to natural gas, adding renewables, energy efficiency, etc.

The EPA concluded that the “best” (most efficient and economical) way to reduce power plant emissions is to support those efforts by requiring states to reduce the average carbon intensity of their overall power sectors. They could reduce the emissions of individual plants, or increase energy efficiency, or build more renewables, or replace coal plants with natural gas. In the argot, the plan allowed emission reductions “beyond the fenceline” of individual power plants.

By setting targets at the aggregate level, rather than at the level of individual power plants, the CPP gave states maximum flexibility (something conservatives ostensibly support in general). It left them more than one tool for compliance.

The alternative — requiring only emission reductions “within the fenceline,” at individual plants — was seen as untenable. The fact is, an individual fossil fuel power plant just doesn’t have the capacity to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions much (absent carbon capture and sequestration, which is still wildly expensive). It can operate more efficiently, getting more power per unit of fuel, but those are improvements at the margin. The only practical way to get substantial reductions from the power sector is to require aggregate reductions.

As soon as the CPP was proposed, a large coalition of 24 states, along with several companies and other groups, sued. (There were actually multiple suits that eventually got consolidated into one.)

The main legal critique was simple: By regulating beyond the fenceline, the EPA had exceeded its statutory authority. (For an in-depth look at the fenceline question, you can read this post.)

In January 2016, the DC Circuit Court of Appeals denied a motion to stay the CPP while it was under legal consideration. Just a few weeks later, in February, the Supreme Court overrode that decision with a 5-4 decision of its own, issuing a stay on the CPP until the litigation was settled.

Although both sides had already made their case in circuit court, the court agreed to the EPA’s request that it withhold judgment until EPA issues a replacement plan. Since, as was inevitable, that replacement plant has sparked a lawsuit, it will end up in court anyway.

Long story short: Despite what you’d think from listening to Trump administration rhetoric, no court has yet ruled on the fenceline question. And a court eventually must.

Obama’s EPA did its homework, and beyond-the-fenceline proponents are confident of their case, at least in circuit court. But the case is likely to go back to the Supreme Court, and, well, we all know how that’s going.

If courts end up rejecting the Trump EPA’s inside-the-fenceline interpretation, it would throw the agency into chaos. But it would give a Democratic successor administration free rein to issue a new, stronger CPP (which the Resources for the Future analysis says could reduce electricity sector emissions 37 percent above the baseline case by 2030).

If courts accept the narrow interpretation, it would be an enormous blow to Democratic efforts on climate change going forward, putting the Clean Air Act, at least Section 111, out of reach as a carbon reduction tool.

3) ACE is so weak, it could potentially lead to higher emissions

Trump’s EPA accepted the inside-the-fenceline restriction that Obama’s EPA found untenable, so ACE only applies to individual plants. Consequently, it won’t reduce carbon emissions much.

The CPP did not set mandatory carbon reduction targets, but the EPA calculated that if states opted for the most stringent pollution control plans, the CPP would yield electricity sector emission reductions of 32 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. (Since EPA’s 2015 analysis, progress on clean energy has been incredibly rapid. We now know that most of the emission reductions CPP targeted were going to happen anyway. Thus the need for an updated CPP.)

ACE, on the other hand, might not reduce emissions at all relative to baseline. It might even raise them. Yes, you read that right: Trump’s pollution rule might produce more pollution than no rule at all.

How is that possible? Well, remember, ACE applies only to individual power plants (coal plants, mostly), and the only way to improve the emissions performance of individual power plants is through efficiency upgrades. But efficiency upgrades — heat rate improvements (HRI), in the lingo — make those plants cheaper to run.

If they’re cheaper to run, utilities will run them more often. That will increase their net emissions. Resources for the Future refers to this as “rebound” and says the EPA underestimates it in several ways.

First, the agency plans changes to New Source Review — pollution standards that must be met by new or upgraded plants — to make it easier to upgrade coal plants without triggering new standards. (See No. 4, below.) That will have the effect of boosting HRI. In the initial draft release of ACE, those standards changes were included. But in the final rule, they were left out, enabling the EPA to lowball HRI.

But the agency still plans to make those changes to New Source Review; by failing to include them in its analysis of ACE, it is deliberately hiding the ball.

Second, in its analysis, the EPA excluded two of the best technologies for HRI (blade path upgrades and redesign/replace economizers — don’t ask). And third, the agency’s analysis excludes the Section 45Q tax credit passed by Congress, which would offer tax credits for carbon capture and sequestration.

Long story short, even the administration’s paltry project carbon emission reductions from ACE — between 0.7 and 1.5 percent lower than baseline — are likely overstated. In fact, coal plants are likely to run more than EPA estimates, will means CO2 will fall less (or not at all) and other local air pollutants will increase in many states, with all their concomitant health effects.

A final note: reductions of 0.7 to 1.5 percent are basically a rounding error and they hinge entirely on the market fate of coal plants. Resources for the Future ran an analysis of several different market scenarios and found that even small changes in market assumptions — demand, the price of natural gas, etc. — could wipe out those gains.

Basically, ACE isn’t a serious plan to reduce carbon emissions. It’s more of a statement by Trump’s EPA that it doesn’t have the power to reduce power sector carbon emissions.

4) Gutting New Source Review (which goes along with ACE) could also raise emissions

From an environmental perspective, the original sin of the Clean Air Act (at least the 1970 and 1990 amendments to the CAA) was grandfathering.

The presumption was that new power plants would be built with modern pollution controls and old plants would gradually phase out and close down. So existing plants were grandfathered in — they didn’t have to meet the new standards.

To ensure that existing plants didn’t increase their pollution in the meantime, the CAA standards applied not only to new plants but to existing plants that made substantial upgrades that would increase their pollution. More specifically, “any physical change in, or change in the method of operation of, a stationary source which increases the amount of any air pollutant emitted by such source or which results in the emission of any air pollutant not previously emitted” would trigger the standards.

Any utility planning a new plant or a plant upgrade has to submit to the New Source Review to ensure they’re meeting pollution standards.

So if utilities built new plants, they had to meet modern pollution standards. If they upgraded old plants, they had to meet modern pollution standards. But if they just kept their polluting old plants running and running forever, without upgrades, they didn’t have to meet modern pollution standards. And so that’s what they did.

Consequently, the US has been saddled with a large, old fleet of dirty coal plants for decades, with utilities making just enough repairs to keep them in operation but not enough modifications and upgrades to trigger New Source Review. The average age of a US coal plant is 39 years — roughly its rated life span.

Environmentalists have complained about these plants for ages, saying that utilities should shut them down. Utilities have also complained, saying the prohibitive costs of NSR are preventing them from upgrading their fleets.

Obama’s CPP was supposed to finally get at those old plants. Given the way NSR has traditionally worked, ACE would have too. It would have forced plants to make efficiency improvements, which would have triggered NSR, which would have triggered tighter standards. (By EPA’s own estimate, 80 percent of coal-fired power plants do not meet current NSR standards for local air pollutants.)

Trump’s EPA doesn’t want utilities to face the terrifying prospect of being forced to clean up their old fleets (“enormous new permitting burdens”), so it plans to “reform” New Source Review. It will no longer be an increase in total emissions that triggers the review — only an increase in a plant’s hourly emissions rate. If a plant reduces its hourly emissions rate, increases its total runtime, and thus increases its total emissions, no problem.

New Source Review is one of the very few regulatory tools available to reach these existing, dirty plants, and EPA wants to take it off the table. Long-term, that could free lots of utilities to update their dirty old coal plants (to comply with ACE) and keep them running even longer.

5) Even after torturing the numbers, the EPA couldn’t make ACE look like a good deal

The awkward fact for Republicans has always been that air quality regulations work. They produce social, economic, and health benefits well in excess of their compliance costs. There is a robust literature and a long practical history showing as much. (See here for the EPA’s cost-benefit analyses on the CAA, which links to dozens of independent sources.)

At every new round of regulations, conservatives and polluting industries complain that they are too onerous, that they will destroy the economy, cost jobs, raise energy prices. And every time, it doesn’t happen. Compliance proves cheaper than expected, the economy continues growing, and public health improves.

Republicans have not responded to this reality by accepting that they were wrong about air quality regulations. Instead, they’ve responded by trying to game the numbers, massaging cost-benefit calculations to give more amenable outcomes.

That continues in the ACE proposal. As Brad Plumer reported in a great New York Times piece, the EPA no longer counts climate benefits that occur outside US borders, which is both morally and atmospherically daft.

But even more daft, rather than the Obama administration’s 3 percent discount rate, Trump’s EPA is using a discount rate of 7 percent.

Discount rates refer to how much future benefits are “discounted” when expressed in today’s dollars — or more colloquially, how highly we value future benefits. (A higher rate means we value them less; a lower rate, more. A rate of zero means we value them equally as much as present benefits.)

A 7 percent discount rate is at the high end of what markets and governments use for personal investments, i.e., how much individual investors value their future profits. But applied to intergenerational investments, i.e., how much sacrifice we’re collectively willing to impose on future generations, it is sociopathic.

“If you use a rate above 5 percent,” Maureen Cropper, an economist at the University of Maryland, told Plumer, “you’re essentially saying that we shouldn’t worry today about anything that happens 100 years from now.” (If you want to dig deeper, here is a post I once did on discount rates, using otters.)

Using these tricks and others, all of which make the rule more legally vulnerable, EPA cut its estimate of the “social cost of carbon” — the total societal value of a ton of GHG emission reductions — from around $50 (the Obama administration’s median number, arrived at after an extensive interagency process that Trump has tried to cancel) to between $1 and $7 (a value rectally extracted by Trump’s EPA over the course of months).

Naturally, that makes cutting greenhouse gases look a lot less attractive. But here’s the first twist.

Even if the climate benefits of the CPP are cut close to nothing, the other benefits, primarily in reductions of local air pollutants like SO2 and NOx, still more than pay for it. That’s true even though the EPA ignored many benefits it claimed to be unable to quantify.

EPA says they are ""unable to quantify the economic value of changes in exposure to mercury, carbon monoxide, SO2, and NO2, ecosystem effects or visibility impairment"" in regulatory impact analysis https://t.co/YDFACjisfg — ⚡Taylor Kuykendall (@taykuy) August 21, 2018

EPA just couldn’t make the numbers work for it.

And so, as Lisa Friedman first reported for the New York Times, according to the EPA’s analysis, “the new rules could also lead to as many as 1,400 premature deaths annually by 2030 from an increase in the extremely fine particulate matter that is linked to heart and lung disease, up to 15,000 new cases of upper respiratory problems, a rise in bronchitis, and tens of thousands of missed school days.” (And the Resources for the Future analysis shows that those numbers are almost certainly conservative.)

Yes, the EPA is proposing a policy that it concedes will lead to 1,400 premature deaths, 48,000 new cases of “exacerbated asthma,” and at least 21,000 new missed days of school every year, through 2030. That should be fun to justify to a court.

And as Nathanael Johnson noted in Grist, EPA’s analysis shows that ACE’s net costs outweigh its net benefits:

EPA’s press officers aren’t exactly highlighting the findings that the proposal would leave Americans worse off. In a fact sheet, for example, the EPA trumpets its finding that ACE could save power plants up to $6.4 billion in compliance costs. But wade into the details to look up that scenario (check out table 18 on page 165), and you see that the EPA weighs that $6.4 billion against health costs that run between $16.6 billion and $75 billion.

“When an agency wants to do something that’s harmful to the American people, it typically tries to hide it,” Richard Revesz of the Institute for Policy Integrity told Johnson. “What’s unusual here is that the EPA just comes out and says it.”

However — and here’s the second twist — Trump’s EPA is currently working to rectify the situation.

As Friedman smartly notes, the massive study upon which EPA bases much of its work on the health effects of particulates (the famous Harvard “Six Cities” study) would be excluded from EPA consideration if the administration’s daffy “secret science” proposal goes through.

As Vox’s Umair Irfan reported, the proposal would exclude from EPA analysis any study in which participants’ identities are concealed — which is most big public health studies, for obvious reasons. Experts are almost unanimously horrified by the proposal, including the EPA’s science advisers, but it appears to be moving forward.

So enjoy this particular EPA analysis (yet another triumph of career staff over their political hack bosses). The next time EPA runs cost-benefit analysis on an air rule, it won’t include many of the health benefits of pollution reductions, because it will have consciously prevented itself from knowing about them.

6) We may have already reached the CPP’s 2030 goal; it’s time for more ambition, not less

According to the Sustainable Energy In America Factbook, US power sector emissions are down 28 percent from 2005 levels. The researchers at Rhodium Group estimate that they will be down 37 percent by 2025.

That means the CPP reach target for 2030 — 32 percent reduction — will likely be achieved in the next few years, just based on current market trends.

This extraordinary progress has been hard-won, utility by utility, and the CPP — even though it never went into effect! — was a big part of that. The tangible prospect of federal regulations got every state and utility, even those with no interest in climate change, thinking, talking, and planning around carbon reductions. And guess what? When utilities start looking around in earnest, they find that cutting carbon is pretty easy.

Reducing electricity sector emissions has proven much cheaper and easier than envisioned even by the optimists at Obama’s EPA. The sensible thing to do in this situation is to boost the plan’s ambition.

In comparing the ACE to the CPP, remember that the emissions baseline has changed a lot since 2014 thanks to cheap renewables and natural gas. @EPA could have responded to this by raising the ambition bar. Instead, they lowered it. pic.twitter.com/REdDtPiy9x — Trevor Houser (@TrevorGHouser) August 21, 2018

It is difficult to know just how much the weakening of CPP into ACE will blunt that progress — how much progress still depends on policy and how much it has taken on a market momentum of its own. (One thing upon which virtually every expert agrees: US coal is going to continue dying.)

Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University took a look at prospects for the electricity sector hitting Paris climate targets without the CPP. They found that it basically depends on natural gas prices. If they stay low or fall further, there’s a chance of hitting 2025 and 2030 Paris targets. Even if they rise a bit, Paris targets are still within reach, though “it becomes essential for many of the existing regulatory and tax inducements to be retained, and perhaps enhanced.” (In particular, they mention renewing federal renewable energy tax credits, which are set to expire.)

But there is broad consensus in the energy community that even if the electricity sector can limp past the 2030 finish line without (much) supportive federal policy, there’s no way the US will get on track for its longer-term carbon targets (80 percent reductions by 2050) without concerted policy support.

Depending on how courts rule on the fenceline issue, it’s possible that a Democratic administration that takes power in January 2021 could almost immediately issue a strengthened CPP, targeting, say, 80 percent electricity sector reductions by 2030, which will definitely wipe out all the coal and rein in natural gas.

Alternatively, if a Supreme Court decision with Brett Kavanaugh restricts the EPA to inside the fenceline, the prospect of substantially reducing carbon emissions using EPA regulations will basically be off the table, leaving federal legislation — or action at the state and local level — the only road forward on climate change.

Even more alternatively, if Trump wins reelection, the EPA by 2024 is likely to be a thoroughly degraded agency, its rules and staff stacked in favor of industry and most of its institutional memory and expertise lost. And the US will be out of the global climate effort entirely, a rogue actor lurching in the direction of myopic greed during the years the world most needs solidarity."
Dems accuse DOJ of trying to hobble Congress’ oversight to protect Trump,https://www.politico.com,"['Kyle Cheney', 'Andrew Desiderio']",08-20-2019,2019,8,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/08/20/dems-doj-congress-trump-1469789,"President Donald Trump sued the House Oversight and Reform Committee earlier this year, in his personal capacity. | Patrick Semansky/AP Photo Congress Dems accuse DOJ of trying to hobble Congress’ oversight to protect Trump

The Justice Department is ignoring centuries of investigations into presidents in an attempt to dramatically curtail Congress’ power to probe President Donald Trump, House Democrats argued Tuesday.

In a court filing, House lawyers said the Justice Department’s call to invalidate a subpoena for Trump’s financial records was so sweeping it would essentially inoculate presidents from congressional inquiry — reversing precedents that began with George Washington, who submitted to congressional inquiry.

Story Continued Below

“These arguments are fabricated out of whole cloth: they may represent what the department wishes the law were, but they are not the law,” House lawyers wrote, accusing the Justice Department of trying to rewrite Congress’ authority to investigate a sitting president.

Trump sued the House Oversight and Reform Committee earlier this year in his personal capacity after Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) issued a subpoena to accounting firm Mazars USA, seeking several years of the president’s financial records. The subpoena came after the president’s former personal attorney and fixer Michael Cohen accused Trump of artificially inflating and deflating the values of his assets in order to win approval for loans — including one in a bid to buy the Buffalo Bills — or reduce his overall tax burden.

District Judge Amit Mehta, an appointee of President Barack Obama, upheld the committee’s subpoena in May, but Trump’s attorneys appealed the decision. The case is being heard at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.

Trump’s personal lawyers contend the committee overstepped its authority by subpoenaing the president’s personal records, arguing the committee failed to identify a legitimate “legislative purpose” to support its demands. Last week, the Justice Department echoed those arguments, suggesting courts should look dubiously at any efforts by Congress to “regulate the president.”

Trump’s personal legal team endorsed the Justice Department’s argument in a separate filing Tuesday, urging the court to give great weight to DOJ’s claims.

“The lack of any historical support for a legislative subpoena from a standing committee of Congress for the president’s records — directed to a third-party custodian no less — raises constitutional red flags,” Trump’s lawyers wrote, calling the committee’s demands “blunderbuss” and unreasonably broad.

In response, House general counsel Douglas Letter and his deputies rejected that as “an astounding and novel theory of limited congressional power to conduct investigations and oversight.”

Letter invoked the St. Clair investigation of 1792, when Washington acknowledged that a House inquiry for presidential papers could be valid “as the public good would permit.” He went on to cite an 1861 investigation of Abraham Lincoln during the Civil War, the Pearl Harbor investigation of 1945, Congress’ access to Richard Nixon’s tax returns, the Iran-Contra investigation of 1987 and the Whitewater investigation that began in 1995 as examples of presidents being targeted by — and at times responsive to — congressional inquiries.

“Presidents from George Washington on (unlike Mr. Trump) have understood that Congress has the power to conduct investigations and oversight of the president as part of the constitutional design,” the attorneys added.

Letter also noted that the argument from Trump’s personal attorneys and the Justice Department suggest Congress must already know the legislation it wants to pass before it has gathered any facts in its investigation.

“The department’s test is at odds with the Supreme Court’s express recognition that legislatures need facts to legislate wisely—facts that are frequently obtained through investigations,” House lawyers wrote.

They argued, as they have in previous court filings, that Congress has broad investigative authority as a co-equal branch of government.

“The Oversight Committee’s subpoena is an exercise of the House’s Article I power and not an attempt to usurp Executive power,” the House attorneys wrote.

Byron Allen Rips Comcast & Donald Trump’s DOJ For “Institutionalized Racism” As SCOTUS Showdown Looms,https://deadline.com,"['Dominic Patten Mike Fleming Jr', 'Dominic Patten', 'Mike Fleming Jr']",08-19-2019,2019,8,https://deadline.com/2019/08/byron-allen-comcast-civil-rights-lawsuit-supreme-court-filing-reaction-doj-donald-trump-1202671369/,"With the nation's highest court aiming to look at the ongoing lawsuit between the NBCU owner & Entertainment Studios, the DOJ has now waded in

EXCLUSIVE: Heading towards a $20 billion showdown with Comcast at the U.S. Supreme Court this fall in his long running racial discrimination lawsuit against the media giant, Byron Allen today tore into the Brian Roberts-run behemoth and an 11th hour intervention by the Department of Justice

“This is historic,” the Entertainment Studios boss said of the August 15 brief filed by the feds seeking to tighten the definitions of a Reconstruction Era statute in Comcast’s favor. “Donald Trump’s DOJ and Comcast are working together to destroy a civil rights statute in the U.S. Supreme Court.”

“You have one of the biggest media companies in the world, which has been beating up Donald Trump for racism, and now they are saying, we will work together to maintain institutionalized racism in America, in this Amicus Brief they delivered last Thursday,” Allen asserted in the starkest of terms of the now William Barr-run DOJ and its move to tip the scales for Comcast as the parties await a November 13 hearing before the nine Justices.

The newly declared emphasis by the DOJ now puts a more than 150-year law in a distinctly different light from how Allen’s lawyers have been reading it, as the Department’s filing openly says.

“Although the statute does not expressly describe the necessary causal link between a plaintiff ’s race and a defendant’s refusal to contract, the text is most naturally read to require but-for causation, and background common-law principles confirm that a but-for rule applies,” the incensory submission last week from Solicitor General Noel Francisco and Assistant AG Joseph Hunt argues (read it here).

“The court of appeals erred in concluding otherwise,” the DOJ brass state of lower court ruling in February in the huge money suit that Allen first filed in early 2015, along with a $10 billion suit against Charter Communications several months later. Comcast and Charter sought to have the matter dismissed. When they failed in that effort to end a case that they framed as a form of corporate expression, the MSNBC-owner took the battle to Chief Justice John Roberts and the Associate Justices.

The government detailed its POV by saying last week that “because ‘making’ a contract means entering a contract, a person does not enjoy ‘the same right’ guaranteed by Section 1981 if race prevents her from entering a contract that a similarly situated white person would have entered. And the inverse is also true.”

The feds’ brief leaning into the law to require that Entertainment Studios has to prove that race was not merely a motivating factor, as 9th Circuit interpreted the statute earlier this summer. Now, under the DOJ’s take of the stature, Allen’s lawyers could be required to prove that race was absolutely only reason that Comcast didn’t place the company’s channels on its distribution services and platforms.

For Allen, the result is a near impossible standard for Entertainment Studios or any other person or entity availing themselves of the statute as it presently stands.

“They said, we need to go to the Supreme Court and change the definition of the statute so African Americans cannot use it and we can compromise everyone’s civil rights,” Allen told Deadline of the sudden paperwork by the DOJ, offering the Comcast and their well-funded lobbyists in D.C. an advantage at the Supreme Court.

“Comcast, in the name of profits, is compromising everyone’s civil rights,” the CEO and Joe Biden-donor proclaimed. “If you think you have a good case, take me to court. Deal with me. Don’t jeopardize everybody’s civil rights.”

Contacted by Deadline, Comcast had no comment on the DOJ brief or Allen’s remarks about the filing. Entertainment Studios themselves have until next month to respond to the feds’ filing and Comcast’s own docket entry citing the Appeal Court reading of the post-Civil War statute as too broad.

Following a surprising reversal of fortune this winter where the 9th Circuit Court of Appeal essentially brought the case back to life, SCOTUS agreed in June that they would review the matter after a request by Philadelphia-based and very well politically connected Comcast.

With the initial filing of his cases in 2015 and 2016, Allen’s contention has been that both Comcast and Charter violated the Civil Rights Act after he attempted for years to get the cable giants to carry his networks, which were available to millions of television viewers through rival distributors including Verizon, the now AT&T-owned DirecTV and DISH. The African-American executive said he has been repeatedly rebuffed and jerked around and states clearly that he believes race played a factor because Entertainment Studios is a fully minority owned entity.

Both Comcast and Charter in their respective suits have said race was not a factor in the carriage deals or lack there of.

Allen and Entertainment Studios are represented in the case by a team from Miller Bardondess LLP and University of California Berkley School of Law’s Erwin Chemerinsky. Attorneys from Gibson Dunn & Crutcher LLP are working for Comcast in the matter."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - American Airlines Group Inc, the largest U.S. airline, will pay $22.1 million to settle claims it falsely reported the times it transferred possession of U.S. mail to foreign postal administrations or other intended recipients, the U.S. Justice Department said on Tuesday.

The United States Postal Service contracted with American to take possession of receptacles of U.S. mail at six locations and then deliver it to numerous international and domestic destinations. The settlement resolves claims American Airlines falsely reported the times it transferred possession of the mail. American did not immediately comment Tuesday.

“We expect companies doing business with the government to comply with their contractual obligations,” said Assistant Attorney General Jody Hunt, who heads the department’s civil division. “The Department of Justice vigorously pursues all manner of fraudulent conduct that undermines the benefits that the government has bargained for.”

American said in a statement it was pleased it had reached a settlement.

“The allegations focused on conduct that was remedied years ago, and we have invested in new equipment and procedures to ensure that we are in full compliance with our commitments,” the statement said. It added that “the U.S. Postal Service is an important customer for American, and we are glad to have corrected these procedures and put this matter behind us.”

American said in a securities filing the Justice Department in April 2015 notified the airline it was investigating American’s 2009 and 2011 contracts with the U.S. Postal Service for the international transportation of mail by air.

The contract required American to take possession of mail at U.S. locations or at various Department of Defense and State Department locations abroad, and then deliver that mail to numerous international and domestic destinations.

“To obtain payment under the contracts, American Airlines was required to submit electronic scans of the mail receptacles to USPS reporting the time the mail was delivered at the specified destinations. The contracts specified penalties for mail that was delivered late or to the wrong location,” the Justice Department said.

“The U.S. Postal Service contracts with commercial airlines for the safeguarding and timely delivery of U.S. Mail to foreign posts, including the mail sent to our soldiers deployed to foreign operating bases,” said Scott Pierce, special agent in Charge, USPS Office of Inspector General."

EPA sued for allowing use of pesticide harmful to bees,https://thehill.com,[],08-20-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/458094-epa-sued-for-allowing-use-of-pesticide-harmful-to-bees,"An environmental group is suing the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for its decision to expand use of a pesticide the agency considers toxic to bees.

In July the EPA said it would allow sulfoxaflor to be used in ways barred during the Obama administration as well as on new crops where the pesticide had not been used before.

“Even for Trump’s EPA, which seems to measure success by pesticide-company profits, it’s stupefying to OK spraying a bee-killing poison across millions of acres of crops frequented by bees,” Lori Ann Burd, director of the Center for Biological Diversity’s environmental health program, said in a statement. “While leading scientists and countries across the globe are calling for eliminating harmful bee-killing pesticides like sulfoxaflor, Team Trump is cheerfully promoting its use like a corporate PR firm. It’s nauseating.”

Burd said the pesticide will harm not just bees and butterflies but also plants that rely on them for pollination.

The EPA would not comment on the lawsuit but said the pesticide ""provides benefits to growers and is supported by strong science that shows minimal risks for pollinators.""

In previous documents, the EPA described sulfoxaflor as “very highly toxic” to bees, and a study published in Nature last year found sulfoxaflor inhibited bumblebee reproduction.

In a July call with reporters to announce the decision, a top EPA official emphasized the agency’s research on the pesticide's effects on bees and said the rule was designed with pollinators in mind.

“To reduce exposure to bees, the product label will have crop-specific restrictions and important pollinator protection language,” including limits on how close to bloom sulfoxaflor can be sprayed, the official said.

But it may be difficult to monitor whether the regulations spare bees as intended. Just before EPA’s decision on sulfoxaflor, the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced it was suspending one of the few remaining government data sets that monitor bee populations and loss.

The center’s suit, filed in the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, argues the EPA failed to compile “substantial evidence” as required under law before approving sweeping new uses of sulfoxaflor. They say the EPA also failed to consult with other agencies to ensure the new regulation wouldn’t harm endangered species.

The suit is not the first on the pesticide.

It was temporarily barred after a lawsuit from beekeepers in 2015, pushing the EPA in 2016 to change its instructions for how to use the pesticide in a way designed to reduce the harm to bees.

EPA said it was spurred to reconsider uses of sulfoxaflor following numerous emergency requests from states — many of which the agency granted — to allow the use of the pesticide on certain crops. It contends sulfoxaflor is safer than the alternatives.

The regulation allows farmers to once again use sulfoxaflor on citrus, cotton and types of squash, and the pesticide can now be used on alfalfa, corn, cocoa, grains and pineapple, among others, for the first time.

In some cases, farmers will not be able to spray sulfoxaflor within three days of bloom, but bee activists say the pesticide can remain in the soil and harm bees.

Bees are key in the production of almost a third of U.S. crops, spurring a commercial bee industry that brings colonies from field to field to pollinate farmers’ fields.

The EPA said the economic plight of farmers was a factor in its decision. The agency said growers could see net revenue losses of up to 50 percent if they aren't able to use the pesticide.

But Burd said pesticides like sulfoxaflor are dangerous to bees because they attack the nervous system, causing bees to get confused and diminishing their appetite.

“They don’t respond as well to predators ... cognitive loss is causing them to die as they get lost in the field,” she told The Hill previously.

While Pompeo says he will remain as the top U.S. diplomat for as long as Trump wants, many supporters and critics see the 55-year old former congressman and CIA director as charting his own political future that will likely include a presidential campaign of his own down the road.

In 2016, Pompeo was a Tea Party conservative serving in the House of Representatives, known best for his pugnacious role sparring with then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton during the Benghazi hearings. He was also an ardent opponent of Trump and a supporter of Sen. Marco Rubio.

Olivier Douliery-Pool/Getty Images

His stance was widely known. But in a March 2016 video published by the New Yorker magazine Monday, Pompeo is seen blasting Trump ahead of the Kansas primary and comparing him to President Barack Obama: ""We've spent seven and a half years with an authoritarian president who ignored our Constitution. We don't need four more years of that.""

Pompeo laughed off the comments Tuesday, saying, ""It was a tough political campaign and when I'm on your team, I am all in, as I was, and when my candidate left, I was all in for President Trump then as well.""

He pledged loyalty to serving in Trump's administration for ""as long as President Trump continues to want me to be his Secretary of State."" Despite again ruling out a run for Kansas's open Senate seat next year, speculation that he will jump in the race late continues. The latest tea leave to some analysts is a meeting he had Tuesday in New York with the Committee to Unleash Prosperity, a conservative economic advocacy group.

President Trump ""is my leader ... I would love to serve for him just as long as I can,"" Pompeo said on ""CBS This Morning"" Tuesday.

But to critics, that loyalty has gone too far at times. Pompeo is known to be sensitive to any remark or question about differences between him and Trump and in private is reportedly ""among the most sycophantic and obsequious people around Trump,"" a former senior White House official told the New Yorker.

One anonymous former ambassador went further, comparing Pompeo to a ""heat-seeking missile for Trump's"" rear end, according to the New Yorker, although the official used a slang word.

Pompeo dismissed that as ""offensive"" language and a ""ludicrous"" statement, and he said he shares his disagreements with Trump ""with great frequency.""

""But when he makes a decision, and it's legal, it is my task to go execute that with all the energy and power that I have,"" Pompeo added.

Pompeo's predecessor has said Trump repeatedly asked for things that were illegal.

""So often, the president would say here's what I want to do and here's how I want to do it and I would have to say to him, 'Mr. President I understand what you want to do, but you can't do it that way. It violates the law,"" former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said in December, nine months after he was fired by Trump over their many disagreements on foreign policy.

After Tillerson made those comments, Trump tweeted that he was ""dumb as a rock"" and that Pompeo was ""doing a great job, I am very proud of him."""
Trump Administration Asks Supreme Court to Permit Employment Discrimination Against Transgender Workers,https://time.com,['Tara Law'],,,,https://time.com/5654844/title-vii-trump-transgender-department-of-justice-supreme-court/,"The Trump administration’s Department of Justice is asking the Supreme Court to set a legal precedent that would enable employers to fire employees because they are transgender.

The Department of Justice has submitted a brief to the Court Friday asking the Justices to rule that Title VII, a federal law that prohibits employment discrimination on the basis of sex, race, color, religion or national origin, does not protect transgender people. The department argued that they should throw out a lower court ruling that found that a funeral home that fired a transgender woman had discriminated against her.

The brief concerns R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes Inc. v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, one of three cases that the Supreme Court agreed to hear earlier this year that concern whether Title VII can be applied to LGBTQ workers.

In the case, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit found that the owner of the funeral home, Thomas Rost, had violated the law when he fired Aimee Stephens, a transgender woman who worked for the company from 2007 to 2013. According to court documents, Stephens sent the company a letter in 2013 that said she struggled with a “gender identity disorder” and planned to begin to live as a woman, including by wearing the company’s female uniform – a jacket and skirt – instead of a suit and tie.

The company argued that Stephens was fired because she refused to wear the company’s dress code and argued that “[m]aintaining a professional dress code that is not distracting to grieving families is an essential industry requirement that furthers their healing process.”

In its brief, the Department of Justice has argued in favor of the funeral home, arguing that Title VII only protects what it defines as “biological sex.”

“In 1964 [when Title VII was enacted], the ordinary public meaning of ‘sex’ was biological sex. It did not encompass transgender status,” the DOJ writes, clarifying, “In the particular context of Title VII—legislation originally designed to eliminate employment discrimination against racial and other minorities—it was especially clear that the prohibition on discrimination because of “sex” referred to unequal treatment of men and women in the workplace.”

Chase Strangio, an American Civil Liberties Union attorney representing Stephens, told HuffPo that the case could weaken Title VII protections both for transgender people and other groups.

“People don’t realize that the stakes are extending not just the trans and LGB communities, but every person who departs from sex stereotypes: Women who want to wear pants in the workplace, men who want more childbearing responsibilities,” Strangio said.

Assistant Interior Secretary Joe Balash, one of the highest placed Alaskans in the Trump administration, has resigned.

His boss, Interior Secretary David Bernhardt, announced it by tweet Tuesday afternoon.

Assistant Secretary Joe Balash announced today his plans to move on from @Interior and I stand with @POTUS in thanking him for his exemplary service to the American people. — Secretary David Bernhardt (@SecBernhardt) August 20, 2019

Balash was confirmed in 2017 as Interior’s assistant secretary for Land and Minerals Management. He oversees the Bureaus of Land Management and Ocean Energy Management. He’s been working to prepare for the first oil lease sale in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.

In his resignation letter, Balash does not cite a reason. He said he’s proud of the work he’s done, including lifting regulations on resource extraction industries, and the environmental work on ANWR.

“Implementing your executive orders promoting energy independence and economic growth are a career highlight that I will one day tell my grandchildren about,” Balash wrote in his letter, addressed to President Trump.

From the archives: Meet the Trump administration official whose signature could formally open ANWR to drilling.

In a brief phone call, Balash said he’s resigning to pursue another opportunity, which he said he’d describe at a later date. His resignation takes effect Aug. 30.

Balash grew up in North Pole and previously worked as Alaska’s commissioner of Natural Resources as well as chief of staff to U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan."
Meet the man ready to battle Congress in support of Trump’s immigration strategy,https://qz.com,[],,,,https://qz.com/1667511/meet-tom-homan-trumps-immigration-hawk-up-for-top-role-at-dhs/,"Tom Homan officially retired after 34 years of government service last June, but it’s pretty hard to tell. He has been an upstate New York beat cop, a Border Patrol officer and, these days, he’s the acting head of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

Homan, 57, is also now one of the most vocal defenders of US president Donald Trump’s controversial immigration policies as a Fox News talking head and fiery op-ed contributor. His unyielding support was on full display at a bruising Congressional hearing in July, when Democrats attacked the administration’s continuing policy of family separation.

“I am thankful that we have a president that not only talks the talk about securing our border, but he walks the walk,” Homan said at the hearing. “No president has done more to try to secure our border, especially in a time of crisis, than president Trump.” He cited Trump’s executive orders, emergency declaration, and an agreement with Mexico that many immigration experts said was underwhelming.

In return, Homan is perpetually floated as a top candidate for any big Department of Homeland Security (DHS) job that comes up, including most recently the big one: Secretary. Trump even named Homan his “immigration czar” during a rambling Fox & Friends phone interview in June. He neglected to tell Homan, who has not formally been offered the job.

The Trump White House has not served as a smart career move for people of Homan’s age and experience. Well-established experts often leave with a worse reputation than when they arrived. There was Gary Cohn, the former economic advisor, whose reason for leaving earned him his own scathing Onion article. Rex Tillerson’s many years in the oil industry may forever be overshadowed by his firing as secretary of state while on the toilet.

Nonetheless, Homan is eager to serve, he told Quartz in a recent interview. He said he expects the president to nominate someone soon to be the permanent secretary of DHS. He’s not sure if it will be him, but whoever it is, he said, “has to be ready for a fight” with Congress.

Homan says democrats want “open borders” and to make “illegal immigration legal.” So whoever Trump nominates will need to withstand the likely political backlash.

“If your feelings are easily hurt, it’s not a job for you,” he said. He noted the time that the former secretary, Kirstjen Nielsen, was booed in a Mexican restaurant in Washington after the administration launched its family separation policy.

As far as potential nominees go, Homan makes sense for Trump. He epitomizes the all-or-nothing approach of the president’s anti-immigration effort.

The White House’s current demands, as Homan stated in his Congressional testimony, include rewriting some of the current foundations of US immigration policy. The president wants Congress to eliminate the “Flores Settlement,” for instance, which limits the amount of time the government can detain families and provides immigrant children human rights protections. He also wants to alter the Trafficking Victims Protection Act (TVPRA), which forces US officials to carefully screen children from Central America before deporting them, and tighten the standards by which asylum-seekers can claim they face a “credible fear” at home.

Back in 2016, when Trump was running for president, Homan was reluctant to share his thoughts on the candidate’s immigration policies. “I can’t say what I think,” he said at the time. Now, however, he is open about his support. “I don’t agree with everything he’s ever said, but he’s the first president who has ever tried to secure this border,” Homan told Quartz.

Homan says he fully supports the president’s efforts to make asylum laws more strict, for example. About 90% of asylum seekers pass the initial “credible fear” test that allows them to remain in the US and go through the process of applying for protections. The percentage of those who are actually granted asylum, however, has plummeted under the Trump administration. The process can take years, and the Trump administration wants to hold people in detention until they appear in court, resulting in overcrowded and unsanitary detention centers.

Immigration activists say there’s no reason to detain asylum-seekers in this way, and that offering immigrants a more humane option than detention, like assigning a case worker who shepherds them through the system, is a cheaper and more effective option.

“I understand the [credible fear] threshold is low on purpose because we don’t want to send people back to persecution and death. I get that,” Homan said. But it is “ridiculously low.”

On the controversial topic of “removals”—deporting people who have lived in the US for years and may not have committed any crime—Homan similarly has a cut-and-dry take.

“Everyone is having a fit right now,” he said, referring to public reaction to ICE raids. But, he explained, ICE sent out notices to thousands of people informing them they had been ordered to leave the country. He said these people were told to “turn themselves in” so immigration agencies could work with them to get them home. “They refused to show up,” Homan said. “So ICE has to go out and find them.”

“If they don’t do that there is no integrity in the entire system. We might as well take everyone off the border and get rid of all the judges, because there are no consequences.”

Supporting policies that aren’t working

Homan’s apparent allegiance to the Trump administration’s current immigration policy is a problem for the simple reason that the policies are so far not effective, experts say.

The nature of US immigration changed long before Trump became president. In the last two decades, the number of single men coming from Mexico for economic opportunity plummeted. In the same period, more and more families began traveling from Central America to find protection from violence back home.

It was only when Trump entered office, however, that the crisis reached its current level of urgency.

“The administration has repeatedly stated that the Congress is to blame for this situation at the border. But the legal framework in place today is the same that was in place, three, five, and 10 years ago,” said John Cohen, a veteran law enforcement officer and former acting under-secretary at DHS.

The problems at the border are “a direct result of the approach and programs put in place by this administration as it relates to border security,” he added.

Those policies and programs range from diverting funds to build a wall to reducing aid to Central America. The Trump administration also began a “metering” program, which limits the number of people who can apply for asylum. It has forced some asylum-seekers to stay in Mexico during their application process, and is putting more border-crossers in detention facilities. Overworked courts means those migrants could be in detention for months or even years.

“Everything they have done to restrict immigration has been misguided,” Cohen said. Instead of targeting Congress, Trump should be frustrated with the people at the White House who have “sold him an approach to border security and immigration that simply won’t work,” he added.

So Cohen doesn’t see how appointing Homan as secretary would have any positive result.

“My concern is that Homan is a one-trick pony,” Cohen said. “His career has been in a very narrow area of law enforcement…He believes the number one focus of the department and state and federal law enforcement should be immigration enforcement, and that is not a view shared by the overwhelming number of people in law enforcement.”

The DHS has a number of other responsibilities beyond immigration, including emergency response, aviation security and cybersecurity.

Cohen and other former officials argue that DHS needs someone who can simply right the ship, filling the numerous vacancies left by an administration that has removed anyone not on board with its vision. This will become especially important as the department soon faces the potential emergencies of another hurricane season, and tries to balance Trump’s demands to clamp down on legal immigration with the reality of US law, it’s own budget, and its many other responsibilities to the country.

Fighting for Trump

Trump has said he likes a fighter, however. And Homan showcased that kind of pugnaciousness at the House Oversight Committee hearing in July. House Democrats grilled him about the hundreds of kids separated from their parents at the border and the “subhuman” treatment that they faced.

“Do you have no shame about the fact that it’s all done in the shadow of the American flag?” asked a distraught Gerry Connolly, the Virginia Democrat.

Rep. Gerry Connolly to Tom Homan: “You’re not at the border right now! You’re in a hearing room! It’s my time!” https://t.co/PMMPrjVR8C pic.twitter.com/xVGo0FhQTs — The Hill (@thehill) July 13, 2019

Homan became furious after Jesus Garcia, the Illinois Democrat, accused him of ignoring the mistreatment of immigrant children because they were a different race:

In tense exchange, Rep. Jesús García spars with acting ICE Dir. Thomas Homan over child separation: “Is it because these children don’t look like children that are around you?” “Your comments are disgusting!” Homan responds. “This is out of control.” https://t.co/iDdAVvNOKm pic.twitter.com/TJh4StH1UL — ABC News (@ABC) July 12, 2019

Later, Homan told Fox he was so upset, he considered assaulting Garcia. So it seems he might be exactly what Trump is looking for in a new DHS head."
Washing raw chicken won't clean it - it may make you sick,https://www.aol.com,"['Aol Staff', 'Erika Edwards']",08-20-2019,2019,8,https://www.aol.com/article/lifestyle/2019/08/20/washing-raw-chicken-wont-clean-it-it-may-make-you-sick/23797880/,"It's the gooey bits on raw chicken that compel Rita Ross to rinse it off in her kitchen sink before cooking it.

""There's this little film between the skin and meat that I don't like. It's kind of like slime,"" Ross, 63, of Raleigh, North Carolina, said. ""I just feel like washing it makes it cleaner.""

The problem with rinsing raw chicken, however, is that instead of making it ""cleaner,"" it splatters potentially harmful bacteria onto kitchen counters and even other food that's already been properly washed and ready to eat.

That's according to research published Tuesday by the Department of Agriculture.

""A lot of people prepare their salads around the sink, so it's cross-contaminated,"" said Mindy Brashears, deputy undersecretary for food safety at the USDA.

10 PHOTOS 9 Foods You Should Never Eat Raw See Gallery 9 Foods You Should Never Eat Raw So read on to learn about nine foods that you shouldn’t eat raw, and why. Chicken Between the processing plant and the supermarket, raw chicken can pick up lots and lots of nasty little bugs that can send you to the hospital if eaten, so you should make sure that all chicken is cooked to at least 165 degrees. And there’s no need to rinse off chicken before you cook it: the bacteria will be killed during cooking, and the splashing water could infect your whole kitchen. Image Credit: iStockPhoto/Thinkstock Chaya Chaya is a ""superfood"" found in the Yucatan that was a favorite of the Mayans but hasn’t really caught on in the United States (yet). It’s similar to spinach, only it’s much stronger-tasting and only very small quantities of it can be eaten raw. Why? The leaves contain cyanide, which is obviously a deadly poison in large quantities. Boiling the leaves for five minutes neutralizes the toxin. Image Credit: iStockPhoto/Thinkstock Yucca Just like Chaya, yucca (or cassava root) also contains cyanide, or cyanogenic glycosides to be exact. High levels of the toxin are found in its leaves, which prevents it from being eaten by insects and animals, but some also makes its way into the edible root as well. In order to make this starchy tuber edible, it must be dried, soaked in water, rinsed, and cooked as soon as possible after harvest. Image Credit: iStockPhoto/Thinkstock Eggs Sure, Rocky might down raw eggs on a daily basis, but that doesn’t mean it’s smart. While they’re loaded with protein, raw eggs also have the possibility of containing salmonella, which infects about one out of every 30,000 eggs. And because it’s in the yolk, those who are concerned should never eat their yolks runny either. Image Credit: iStockPhoto/Thinkstock Pits/Seeds of Apples, Mangos, Peaches, Pears, and Apricots These you really shouldn’t eat at all; forget about cooking them first. If you crack open seeds and pits from fruits that contain them, the inside is soft and appears to be edible. But don’t eat it: it contains a chemical called amygdalin that can turn into — you guessed it — cyanide (who knew that so many foods contained cyanide?). Thankfully, you’d need to eat a whole lot of peach pits in order to get sick, but we wouldn’t chance it. Image Credit: iStockPhoto/Thinkstock Green Potatoes You know how sometimes older potatoes can begin to turn a funky shade of green? Yeah, you don’t want to eat that part. When potatoes get too much sunlight, a chemical called solanine can build up to toxic levels, and that’s what the green is. If consumed, it can lead to headache, fatigue, nausea, and stomach issues. Store your potatoes in a cool, dry place and you’ll avoid this problem. Image Credit: iStockPhoto/Thinkstock Pork Pork no longer needs to be cooked to well-done, but you should still cook it past the medium point. Pork still has the potential to carry a couple of bugs: trichinosis, a roundworm; and pork tapeworm, which can grow up to 6 feet long in the gut of a pig. If the meat is eaten undercooked, it can transmit the parasite to you, with some unpleasant side effects. These diseases largely hail from the days when pigs were allowed to eat garbage, and have largely been eradicated by modern processing. It’s still risky, though, and rare pork doesn’t taste very good, either. Image Credit: iStockPhoto/Thinkstock Raw Red Kidney Beans If you were to take a few raw kidney beans off the vine and eat them, not only would they taste gross, but within a couple hours you’d be nauseous, vomiting, and have an upset stomach. The culprit? A natural toxin called lectin. Soak the beans in water for at least five hours before cooking and you’ll be fine. Image Credit: iStockPhoto/Thinkstock Rhubarb Leaves You might have heard that rhubarb is poisonous when raw, but it’s actually the leaves you should avoid at all costs. The leaves contain insanely high levels of a toxin called oxalic acid, which when consumed can cause serious kidney damage, and possibly even death. Even a small amount can make you sick, and 10 or so pounds is enough to kill you.

The USDA partnered with North Carolina State University to investigate how home cooks handle raw meat, and how those practices affect nearby food.

The researchers recruited 300 people to prepare chicken and a salad in test kitchens at N.C. State. Some participants watched food safety videos ahead of time that discouraged rinsing raw chicken. Most of those participants followed the advice.

But among the control group — those who did not get the safety messages — 61 percent rinsed their raw meat. And nearly 30 percent of those participants' salads were later found to be contaminated with bacteria from the chicken.

""How many times have you been peeling a vegetable and drop it into the sink, and you just pick it up and go on,"" Brashears said. ""At that point, you've contaminated your vegetables.""

Wash Your Hands Always wash your hands before eating anything, because if you don’t, you’ll also be eating everything that you’ve touched since the last time you washed your hands. Be especially careful if you’ve handled raw meat — in that case, wash your hands before you touch anything else, not just food.

If anything’s come in contact with raw meat, poultry, fish, or eggs, make sure it gets a thorough scrubbing with soap and hot water. Image Credit: Shutterstock.com Cook Meats Thoroughly Eating undercooked meat, especially chicken, can be a one-way ticket to the emergency room. Make sure that all poultry is cooked to 165 degrees and fish to 145 degrees (sashimi and tartares excepted, of course). And if you’re going to be cooking that steak medium-rare, make sure that it’s from a good source; if you have any doubt, cook it to 160 degrees.

Microbiological horror stories

Some of the participants ""washed"" their chicken by soaking it in the sink, either with water only, or adding soap, vinegar or lemon juice.

""These are horror stories from a microbiological standpoint,"" said Ben Chapman, a food safety specialist and professor at N.C. State. Chapman said there's no good evidence that soaking raw chicken in vinegar or lemon juice kills bacteria.

""What surprised me most was just how much food preparation happens in and around a sink after someone washes chicken,"" he said. Often participants rinsed lettuce in a colander in the sink where they'd just had raw chicken.

Contaminated water from the basin then splashes onto the lettuce. ""We in the food safety community didn't really have a good sense of this until the work we did here,"" said Chapman.

No one ate the food prepared in the studies. Investigators went into the test kitchens after the meals were prepared, swabbing the sinks and counters, finding them contaminated even after participants cleaned them.

Spice containers also showed signs of contamination.

In fact, it’s home to as many as 500,000 bacteria per square inch. Spray it down often, clean out your food trap, and scrub with scouring powder like Bon Ami at least once a week. (Getty) Cutting boards: Whether you’re chopping meat, veggies or fruit, your cutting board could be Ground Zero for foodborne illness. Prevent cross-contamination by dedicating one board to meats and another to produce. And always wash your board ASAP after using it—especially if you were working with raw meat. Researchers at UC Davis also recommend plastic cutting boards over wood, because they’re easiest to sanitize—they can go in the dishwasher. Clean a wooden cutting board with soap and warm water, dry it quickly, and seal it with butcher-block oil whenever you notice the wood is drying out. (Getty) Countertops: All the action—chopping, mixing, drink-pouring—happens here, so of course they’re covered with little particles of everything. First off, cut the clutter to give crumbs and germs fewer places to hide. Then wipe them with a damp microfiber cloth after every meal. (Getty) Fridge shelves and drawers: Your refrigerator is home to both raw and cooked foods, and if it’s disorganized, they probably come in contact now and then. Store raw meat in a plastic bag to serve as an extra barrier, and stop spoiled food from turning into science experiments by throwing it away as soon as you notice it. Another cool trick we use at our house: Empty and wipe down the shelves and drawers whenever you do a big grocery shop. (Getty) Sponges: They’ve been banned from commercial kitchens—ban them from yours, too. But if you must use a sponge, rinse it with hot water after every swipe. At the end of every day, get it wet and nuke it in the microwave for a minute. Toss it after a few weeks (one week if you’re missing the daily sanitizing routine). (Getty) Dish towels: If you rush through washing your hands, some germs may still be hanging out on them and you’ll transfer those germs to the dish towel. Change dish towels a few times a week, and wash them with hot water when you do the laundry. (Getty) Makeup brushes: They touch your face every day, coming in contact with oils, bacteria and dead skin cells. Wash them with mild soap whenever you notice makeup buildup. (Getty) Towels: Like dish towels, they pick up any germs left after a shower. Plus, if your bathroom has poor air circulation, towels may get musty if they stay damp too long. Wash them in hot water at least once a week. (Getty) Tub: The equivalent of the kitchen sink for your bod, the tub takes in a lot of grime. Wipe it down with a microfiber cloth every day and get rid of mold spots with baking soda or vinegar. (Find dozens more ways to clean with baking soda here.) (Getty) ​​​Floor around the toilet: It gets splashed, plain and simple. For starters, make sure to put the lid down every time you flush. Clean up noticeable spots right away and scrub with bathroom cleaner at least once a week. (Getty) Faucet handles: You touch these before your hands are clean. ‘Nuff said. Wipe them down with a damp microfiber cloth. (Getty) Toothbrush holder: It’s all about gravity: Many of the germs on your toothbrush drip into the holder. Rinse it out daily—do double-duty while you’re brushing your teeth with the other hand. Then sanitize your toothbrush holder in the dishwasher (if it can take it) or give it a good scrub with soap and water. (Getty) Electronics: Smartphones, keyboards, mice, the remote control (OK, let’s be real: 17 remote controls)—germy fingers come in contact with them all the time. In fact, the National Institutes of Health recently found that cellphones are 10 times dirtier than toilet seats. Wipe them with a damp microfiber cloth as often as possible. Don’t forget to remove any cases so you can clean underneath. (Getty) Doorknobs, handles and light switches: Even if your hand only touches these items for a fraction of a second, that’s enough time to transfer bacteria. Once again, a quick wipe-down with a damp microfiber cloth will do. (Getty) Shoe rack: Footwear is a huge culprit for bringing germs into your home, so it’s no surprise that their storage unit is a bacterial breeding ground. Put some elbow grease into cleaning this one and wipe it with bathroom cleaner—you never know what somebody stepped in. (Getty) Carpets and rugs: Even if you’re using the no-shoes rule, carpets suck up every crumb, dead skin cell and germ that hits them. Vacuum weekly and spritz high-traffic areas with a carpet sanitizer. If you can toss rugs into the laundry, do it. (Getty) Bags: Your purse holds money (super dirty!) and your kid’s lunch bag holds food (raise your hand if you ever forget to clean it out over the weekend). Follow the manufacturer’s instructions on cleaning these to keep them in the best shape. (Getty) Toys: No matter whose toys they are—your kid’s or the dog’s—they probably spend a lot of time in somebody’s mouth. Consider what they’re made of, then clean accordingly, tossing them in the laundry, dishwasher, or wiping with a cloth.

The CDC estimates that 48 million people — one in six — get sick from a foodborne illness each year.

Salmonella is the kind of bacteria most people associate with raw poultry, and leads to about a million illnesses in the U.S. annually, according to the CDC. Most have diarrhea, a fever and stomach cramps, and most recover, but nearly 400 die each year from salmonella.

Another type of bacteria, campylobacter, is also found on raw or under-cooked poultry, and accounts for about 1.3 million illnesses every year.

Even food safety experts are at risk. ""I had campylobacter about a decade ago,"" Chapman said. ""I won't go into details, but it was not fun whatsoever.""

""I always saw my mom and dad do it""

The chicken-washing phenomenon is nothing new. Indeed, it's been happening in kitchens for decades.

""Growing up, I always saw my mom and dad do it,"" said Ashley Williams, 23, a grad student at N.C. State.

The USDA and N.C. State recreated the study to illustrate their findings for NBC News. Both Williams and Ross were participants, and both rinsed their raw chicken.

""I've just always done it this way,"" Ross said. ""That's what people around me did when I was growing up. I picked it up from the culture.""

And it's likely those decades of chicken-washing caused illnesses that went unreported.

""You've probably gotten sick from food and just don't know it,"" Brashears said. ""People say, 'Oh, I had a 24-hour flu' and never went to the doctor.""

Children, the elderly and people with compromised immune systems are most at risk for foodborne illness.

Food safety experts say it's critical to re-educate the next generation, and get kids into the kitchen to teach them not only how to cook, but how to do it safely.

""Just because your mom did it doesn't mean you have to do it,"" said Brashears. ""You can be the one who causes change and stops the cycle of foodborne illness.""

Other ways to reduce the risk of cross-contamination include:

washing hands thoroughly for 20 seconds with soap and water, drying hands with a paper towel, then throwing the paper towel away

sanitizing the sink and kitchen counters before and after food preparation

using a meat thermometer to make sure chicken reaches 165 degrees

using separate cutting boards and utensils for raw meat and other food.

Lindsey Graham says Horowitz FISA report will be 'ugly and damning' for DOJ,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],08-18-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/lindsey-graham-says-horowitz-fisa-report-will-be-ugly-and-damning-for-doj,"Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina predicted Sunday that the upcoming report by Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz on abuse of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act would be “ugly and damning” for the DOJ.

The Republican Senate Judiciary chairman spoke with Fox News host Maria Bartiromo on Sunday Morning Futures, saying the much-anticipated Horowitz report was “coming out in weeks, not days, not months.” In explaining to Bartiromo why the release of the report had been repeatedly delayed — Attorney General William Barr predicted early this year it would come out in May or June — Graham said “every time you turn around you find something new.”

Graham predicted Horowitz would have a lot to say about ""the good, the bad, and the ugly"" at the FBI and DOJ, and would likely have recommendations about what should be done to fix it.





Graham also said once Horowitz finishes his report, it will be sent to the Justice Department for a review for any classified information. The senator said he was meeting with Barr next week to ensure as much of the report as possible is made public.

“I want to declassify as much as possible,” Graham said. “I want the American public to hear the story. I want all of this information to come out. I don’t want people to believe what I say about it — I want them to read for themselves how bad it was.”

""I believe the Horowitz report is going to be ugly and damning regarding the Department of Justice handling of the Russia probe,"" Graham added.

The FBI and DOJ obtained four FISA warrants and renewals against Trump campaign associate Carter Page beginning in October 2016 through June 2017. The 412 pages of redacted FISA documents released in 2018 show the DOJ and FBI made extensive use of the dossier compiled by British ex-spy Christopher Steele, which he put together in 2016 at the behest of the opposition research firm Fusion GPS. The Clinton campaign hired the firm through Marc Elias of the Perkins Coie law firm, and the campaign was briefed about Steele's findings throughout the race. Steele’s funding from Democrats was never revealed to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.

And newly released FBI interview notes with top DOJ official Bruce Ohr shed light on his role as a conduit between Steele and the FBI in 2016 and 2017, even after the bureau says it cut Steele off as a source for leaking to the media. Ohr told the FBI that Steele was desperate Trump not win and suggested some of Steele's information may have stemmed from ""Russian conspiracy theories."" Ohr's wife, Nellie, worked at Fusion GPS, and Bruce Ohr passed her research along to the FBI too.

Graham explained today that Horowitz “is doing a very in-depth dive about the FISA warrant application” and is looking into “the behavior regarding the counterintelligence operation.” Graham said he believed the evidence would show the FBI’s FISA filings were “a fraud on the court.”

The senator specifically pointed to the FBI being “on notice” that Steele “hated Trump, that he was an unreliable informant,” as well as Steele’s information — “unverified to this day” — allegedly coming from Russian sources and allegedly exonerating nonpublic transcripts of interviews of Trump campaign aide George Papadopoulos with an FBI informant, likely Cambridge professor Stefan Halper.

The interactions that Papadopoulos had with the mysterious Maltese professor Joseph Mifsud allegedly led to the FBI opening an inquiry into Trump in July 2016. Mifsud allegedly told Papadopoulos in the spring of 2016 about the Russians having “dirt” on Hillary Clinton. Papadopoulos then allegedly mentioned this to Australian diplomat Alexander Downer, who later passed the information along to the FBI, triggering what the FBI dubbed “Crossfire Hurricane.” Republicans now say exonerating information about Papadopoulos was concealed from the FISA Court.

“I want it all out,” Graham emphasized. “I want people to see how off the rails this investigation got, and I want people to be held accountable. And I am patient, I’m not in a hurry to do it, I want to do it right.”"
Dept. of Energy recommends keeping your thermostat set to 78 or higher,https://www.abc15.com,[],08-20-2019,2019,8,https://www.abc15.com/news/region-phoenix-metro/central-phoenix/dept-of-energy-recommends-keeping-your-thermostat-set-to-78-or-higher,"PHOENIX — What temperature do you keep your thermostat at?

A new report from the Department of Energy suggests keeping your home no cooler that 78 degrees, even during the summer months in Arizona.

The report is aimed at helping people save money during the summer, while trying to keep you cool at the same time.

The DOE recommends keeping your home at 78 or warmer while you’re inside, and turning it up several degrees while you’re at work or away from home.

Here are five tips from the DOE to save money on your energy bill:



On hot days, avoid using the oven; cook on the stove, use a microwave oven, or grill outside.

Take advantage of daylight instead of artificial lighting, but avoid direct sunlight.

Wash only full loads of dishes and clothes. Consider air drying both dishes and clothing.

If you use air conditioning, a ceiling fan will allow you to raise the thermostat setting about 4°F with no reduction in comfort.

Install window coverings to prevent heat gain through your windows.

USDA recalls chicken products due to possible Listeria contamination,http://www.fox5atlanta.com,"['Fox News', 'Claire Simms', 'Cal Callaway', 'Aungelique Proctor']",,,,http://www.fox5atlanta.com/news/usda-recalls-chicken-products-due-to-possible-listeria-contamination,"- The U.S. Department of Agriculture said around 135,810 pounds of fully cooked poultry products from Tip Top Poultry is being recalled due to Listeria monocytogenes contamination concerns.

Tip Top Poultry is based in Rockmart, Georgia.

The possibly contaminated frozen, diced, and mechanically separated ready to eat chicken were produced on January 21, 2019.

Poultry products effected by the recall have ""P-17453"" inside the USDA mark of inspection or on the case. These items were shipped to hotels, restaurants, and institutions nationwide.

According to the USDA, consumption of food contaminated with L. monocytogenes can cause listeriosis, a serious infection that primarily affects older adults, persons with weakened immune systems, and pregnant women and their newborns.

Lawmakers criticize EPA draft rule for curbing rights to challenge pollution permits,https://thehill.com,[],08-20-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/458158-lawmakers-criticize-epa-draft-appeals-rule-for-limiting-rights-to,"Democratic lawmakers are raising concerns over a forthcoming environmental rule that could limit the rights of individuals and communities to challenge granted federal pollution permits.

Three Democrats on the House Energy and Commerce Committee sent a letter to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on Tuesday taking issue with reported changes that they warned could ""benefit wealthy industry groups at the expense of everyday Americans unable to afford lengthy litigation battles.""

The letter follows reports that the EPA is preparing a final regulation that would no longer allow individuals or communities to challenge the Environmental Appeals Board (EAB) on any decisions about how much pollution is legally allowed at nearby power plants. However, the rule would reportedly allow the industry to continue to appeal denials.

“We believe the reported changes would threaten human health and the environment,” the lawmakers wrote Tuesday.

They added that the House panel is “troubled by EPA’s reported efforts to limit the ability of communities to challenge the Agency’s permitting decisions.”

“Additionally, we are concerned that EPA is contemplating actions which could undermine the EAB’s ability to effectively and independently adjudicate permits, limit the scope and nature of EAB’s review, or foreclose administrative appeals altogether,” they wrote.

While the EPA has not finalized the regulation, it is expected to be released soon.

The EPA did not immediately return requests for comment on the lawmakers’ letter. The agency has not officially confirmed or denied the existence of the forthcoming rule.

“EPA is always interested in improving its processes while maintaining environmental protection. Contrary to the speculation by certain parties, EPA is working to protect the public interest and transparently carry out its work,” a spokesman said in a statement in July.

An internal June 19 EPA email obtained by The Hill characterized the proposed procedural rule as an attempt to “streamline and modernize the role of the Environmental Appeals Board in EPA’s permitting process.”

The email sent to staff from Carol Ann Siciliano, the EPA’s acting deputy general counsel for environmental media and regional law offices, noted that the rule proposal was a top priority for EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler Andrew WheelerEPA walks back use of 'cyanide bombs' to protect livestock from wild animals EPA proposes rolling back states' authority over pipeline projects New Mexico says EPA abandoned state in fight against toxic 'forever chemicals' MORE.

"Commerce Department will extend Huawei reprieve, Ross says",https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Felicia Sonmez', ""National Reporter On The Washington Post'S Breaking Political News Team""]",08-19-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/commerce-department-will-extend-huawei-reprieve-ross-says/2019/08/19/82a11436-c275-11e9-9986-1fb3e4397be4_story.html,"Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said Monday that his department will grant another temporary reprieve to Huawei Technologies, delaying the implementation of a penalty on the Chinese tech giant for another 90 days.

Ross made the announcement during an appearance on Fox Business Network.

“It is another 90 days for the U.S. telecom companies,” Ross said. “Some of the rural companies are dependent on Huawei. So we’re giving them a little more time to wean themselves off. But no specific licenses are being granted for anything.”

The next deadline, he added, is roughly Nov. 19.

On Sunday, President Trump suggested that his administration was not likely to grant another reprieve to Huawei, citing national security concerns. “At this moment, it looks much more like we’re not going to do business,” Trump said, pushing back against reports of the expected reprieve.

Trump directed the Commerce Department in May to place Huawei on its “Entity List,” known to some as the “death penalty.” The move makes it difficult for Huawei to do business with any U.S. company. Days later, the Commerce Department announced a 90-day reprieve that allowed some sales to Huawei to continue temporarily, effective May 20.

Ross said Monday that the Commerce Department had also decided to add 46 more Huawei subsidiaries to the Entity List.

“We now have more than 100 subsidiaries on the Entity List,” he said, explaining that “adding more entities makes it more difficult for Huawei to get around the sanctions.”

The ban is one of three by the U.S. government targeting Huawei. Last year, Trump signed a defense-spending bill that barred the federal government and its contractors from doing business with Huawei and several other Chinese companies on national security grounds. A separate ban prohibits companies that do business with Huawei from providing services to the U.S. government.

Some U.S. tech companies have applied for licenses that would allow them to continue to sell to Huawei, arguing that the Commerce Department ban could harm their bottom lines and their ability to innovate."
Chicago Teen Charged for Threatening Abortion Clinic,https://time.com,['Michael Tarm'],,,,https://time.com/5655922/chicago-teen-charged-abortion-clinic-threat/,"(CHICAGO) — A 19-year-old from Chicago is charged with making a threat after he posted messages through a social media site typically used to produce humorous memes, saying he would carry out an attack on a city abortion clinic, according to a federal complaint unsealed Monday.

Farhan Sheikh posted a statement on his iFunny page last week that said he intended to go to the clinic this Friday, Aug. 23, to “slaughter and murder any doctor, patient, or visitor” he saw there, the complaint says. Addressing the FBI in the statement, he added he wasn’t joking. “I am NOT a satirical account,” he said. “I post what I mean, and I WILL carry out what I post.” He also allegedly wrote: “May god forgive me for what I am going to do soon.”

The complaint says Sheikh subscribed to the iFunny account of “ArmyOfChrist,” the purported user name of 18-year-old Justin Olsen, who was charged earlier this month in Ohio with threatening an agent. He allegedly posted support for mass shootings and for any attacks on Planned Parenthood.

Olsen, who was arrested at a home stockpiled with guns and ammunition, had been under investigation since February. But prosecutors in the federal judicial district for northern Ohio said they chose to bring him in in the wake of recent mass shootings in Ohio and Texas.

The complaint against Sheikh doesn’t identify the clinic he is said to have threatened, saying only that it was about four miles from Sheikh’s North Side residence. He is charged with transmitting a threat in interstate commerce, which carries a maximum five-year prison sentence.

Sheikh made an initial appearance in U.S. District Court in Chicago on Monday morning, standing in orange jail clothes and flanked by U.S. marshals. When U.S. Magistrate Judge Susan Cox asked if he understood the accusations against him, he answered, “Yes, ma’am.”

A message left for his court-appointed federal defender, Amanda Penabad, wasn’t immediately returned. A detention hearing is scheduled for Tuesday.

When agents arrested Sheikh on Friday, he told them he believed they were there because of jokes he posted on iFunny, the complaint says. Olsen similarly told the FBI during his arrest that his postings were jokes, according to filings in his case.

Justice moves to halt airline ticket company merger,https://www.foxbusiness.com,[],,,,https://www.foxbusiness.com/features/sabre-stock-drops-as-doj-sues-to-block-farelogix-acquisition,"The U.S. Department of Justice filed a civil antitrust lawsuit Wednesday that aims to block a $360 million deal in which travel-technology giant Sabre Corporation would acquire Farelogix, Inc., a software company that provides ticket-booking services to airlines.

Sabre shares dipped slightly on the news.

Per a press release that accompanied the suit, the DOJ claims that the acquisition would eliminate competition in the travel market that largely benefits airlines and consumers.

Ticker Security Last Change %Chg SABR SABRE CORP. 23.74 -0.19 -0.79%

“Sabre’s proposed acquisition of Farelogix is a dominant firm’s attempt to take out a disruptive competitor that has been an important source of competition and innovation,” Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim of the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division, said. “If allowed to proceed, the acquisition would likely result in higher prices, reduced quality, and less innovation for airlines and, ultimately, traveling American consumers.”

Sabre, which has long operated on outdated tech, is the dominant provider of booking services in the United States, holding more than 50 percent of airline bookings through travel agencies. The company’s revenues totaled approximately $3.9 billion in 2018.

Farelogix’s innovative approach in the travel market, according to the release, “has injected much-needed competition into stagnant booking services markets,” allowing airlines to leverage “their ability to turn to Farelogix to negotiate lower fees with Sabre and the other [global distribution systems], and to reduce their reliance on GDSs for booking services.”

Despite the DOJ suit, Sabre is planning to push ahead with the acquisition. Sabre and Farelogix have extended the new termination date of their acquisition to April 30, 2020.

“Over the past nine months, we believe we have done all we can to address the DOJ’s concerns,” Sean Menke, Sabre president and chief executive officer, said in a statement. “While we hope the DOJ will ultimately recognize that this transaction is pro-competitive, we are prepared to vigorously defend the deal in court if necessary.”"
Brother called FBI to investigate State Department official over hate,https://wtkr.com,['Cnn Wire'],08-20-2019,2019,8,https://wtkr.com/2019/08/20/brother-called-fbi-to-investigate-state-department-official-over-hate/,"The brother of a State Department official linked to a white nationalist group by a civil rights organization tells CNN he reported his sibling to the FBI out of concern about his hateful views.

Matthew Gebert, the State Department employee, has been placed on administrative leave from his job as a foreign affairs officer in the Department’s Bureau of Energy Resources after the civil rights organization’s made the claim.

Gebert’s brother, Michael Gebert, told CNN on Thursday that details in the extensive report released last week by the Southern Poverty Law Center’s Hatewatch initiative are accurate.

Hatewatch alleged that Matthew Gebert “oversaw the Washington, DC-area chapter of a white nationalist organization, hosted white nationalists at his home and published white nationalist propaganda online.” According to the report, he used a pseudonym — Coach Finstock — to express “a desire to build a country for whites only.”

‘I was just so angry’

Michael Gebert identified his older brother as the man in a photo Hatewatch posted of white nationalists gathering in Charlottesville, Virginia, months before the Unite the Right rally that resulted in the killing of a counter-protestor, 32-year-old Heather Heyer.

Michael Gebert also said it was his brother’s voice speaking as “Coach Finstock” on a white nationalist podcast and confirmed Hatewatch’s reporting that he had contacted the FBI about his brother last month through an electronic tip form on the bureau’s website.

“He’s had all this hate growing and accelerating under his skin,” the younger Gebert told CNN in a phone interview after Hatewatch released a report about his outreach to the FBI. “Everything else is keeping up good appearances.”

He told CNN he made the decision to contact the FBI out of concern for his brother’s children.

“It didn’t take courage to submit a tip to the FBI,” he said. “I was just so angry.”

Michael Gebert says he and his brother have long disagreed over politics.

‘So much evil’

Matters reached a head about a year ago at a family gathering in the Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania, he said. After drinking some alcoholic beverages, he said his brother Matthew began using language about Jews, immigrants and minorities that concerned and frightened him.

Michael Gebert explained “it took everything in me” to not react in a violent manner. He said he told his brother, “Matt, I wanna smash your face in.”

He told Hatewatch of that evening: “I saw so much evil in my brother, I could not f**king deal with it.” Even so, Michael Gebert told CNN he still has some sympathy for his brother.

The State Department did not respond to CNN’s request for comment about Michael Gebert’s efforts to warn authorities about his brother’s activities.

The FBI said it does not comment on tips. The agency said it can’t investigate people for holding an ideology or belonging to certain US-based hate groups.

Attempts by CNN to reach Matthew Gebert have been unsuccessful. Hatewatch said in its report that the group’s investigators had been unable to speak to him.

Gebert joined the State Department in 2013, during President Barack Obama’s administration, as a “presidential management fellow,” according to an alumni magazine from his alma mater George Washington University. According to the program’s website, it “attracts and selects the best candidates possible, but is really designed with a more narrow focus – developing a cadre of potential government leaders.”"
USDA: National THC test for hemp ‘as challenging as you think it is’,https://hempindustrydaily.com,['Et On'],08-19-2019,2019,8,https://hempindustrydaily.com/usda-national-thc-test-for-hemp-as-challenging-as-you-think-it-is/,"Federal agriculture authorities are struggling to craft a nationwide THC testing standard so that state and local regulators can tell hemp from marijuana, complicating the release of standardized production rules, according to an official with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).

William Richmond, head of the Specialty Crops Program in the USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service, told a group of dietary-supplement and CBD business owners last week the agency hoped to have hemp rules prepared by now.

But he said the agency is grappling with the Farm Bill‘s requirement for a national THC testing protocol “using post-decarboxylation or other similarly reliable methods.”

“We need to have testing procedures in place,” he said. Coming up with reliable testing methods, he added, is “as complicated as you think it is.”

Richmond gave no timeline for the USDA finishing its work, but he said after his speech the USDA still plans to have rules done in time for the 2020 growing season,

The USDA has been “bombarded with questions” about hemp, he added, and is “working hard to issue the hemp regulations.”

He reminded the CBD companies that the USDA’s hemp regulations won’t be final until the industry has had an opportunity to see them and share feedback.

“Tell us what we got right – and, more important, tell us what we got wrong, because we have the opportunity to fix it,” Richmond said.

Which THC?

THC testing has proved a major challenge in moving the hemp industry to a standardized commodity.

Law enforcement authorities from Texas to Florida have said they don’t have tests that can differentiate between legal hemp and illegal marijuana, and the patchwork of testing standards is complicating the Farm Bill’s goal of allowing nationwide commerce for the new crop.

“What we grow in Oregon needs to be able to go to Colorado, to Kentucky, to whatever state and not run into issues with law enforcement,” said Sunny Summers, who coordinates hemp policy for the Oregon Department of Agriculture.

She also said during her talk at a CBD conference in Denver sponsored by the American Herbal Products Association that THC testing is “a big, big situation that as an industry we need to deal with.”

The Farm Bill’s direction, she said, doesn’t tell states how to prepare tests “using post-decarboxylation or other similarly reliable methods.”

“This is the No. 1 issue that I have – what the heck does that mean?” Summers said. “What is THC? Which version?”

Industry fears

THC testing protocols coming from the USDA could dramatically shake up the growing hemp industry, growers say.

That’s because most U.S. hemp farmers are producing cultivars rich in cannabinoids other than THC – the same types of hemp most likely to violate THC limits depending how and when they are tested.

If post-decarboxylized tests are used, “most of the cultivars and most of the varieties that we’re currently using in the U.S. would no longer be defined as hemp,” said Matt Cyrus, who raises hemp along with hay and cattle in Sisters, Oregon.

Cyrus told Hemp Industry Daily that the USDA’s looming hemp rules could throw many entrepreneurs back to the black market, depending on the testing standard.

“In theory, everybody who has hemp biomass on hand anywhere in the U.S. … would suddenly be outside the law,” said Cyrus, who is also president of the Deschutes County (Oregon) Farm Bureau.

USDA wants to make it easy

Richmond of the USDA told dietary supplement manufacturers that the agency understands how complex it is to set a national THC testing standard, but he promised that federal authorities are scrambling to give farmers and state and local regulators a solution that simplifies interstate hemp commerce.

“Our goal is to provide a consistent, easy-to-follow regulatory framework around hemp production,” he said.

“I can’t speak to whether that means a hard, prescriptive set of requirements for everybody at this stage. But our goal is to provide consistent standards that make sense for growers and for the industry.”"

In a Monday brief, the DOJ argued that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit should block subpoenas from House committees who are seeking Trump’s records at Deutsche Bank and Capital One.

Trump has sued to prevent Capital One and Deutsche Bank from turning over records of their business with the president to the House Financial Services, Intelligence and Oversight and Reform committees.

Those committees issued subpoenas for Trump’s financial records in April as part of a broad investigation into Russian money laundering and financial crimes in the U.S.

The District Court for the Southern District of New York ruled in May that the House subpoenas should proceed, but the requests are on hold while Trump appeals the case.

The Justice Department argued in its Monday brief that the district court erred in approving the subpoenas without asking lawmakers to narrow the scope of their requests. The DOJ said lawmakers have failed to prove a legitimate legislative reason for the subpoenas, which they claim clash with constitutional protections for executive power.

“There is no objective reason for a congressional investigation into the general problem of money laundering and other illicit financial transactions to focus on the President and his family,” the department argued.



“The Committees have not connected the dots between the ‘undeniably broad’ scope of these subpoenas and the general legislative purpose that the House has articulated: closing regulatory loopholes that permit corrupt financial activity,” the department wrote.



The DOJ has also previously weighed in on another court fight for Trump's financial records, in the case involving a subpoena for documents from Mazars, an accounting firm, being sought by the House Oversight and Reform Committee. Earlier this month, the department similarly said in a court filing before the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals that the committee had not provided a legislative reason for seeking those documents."
Commerce Department extends reprieve to let US companies work with Huawei,https://www.cnet.com,['Sean Keane'],08-19-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnet.com/news/us-commerce-department-extends-reprieve-allowing-companies-to-sell-to-huawei/,"Óscar Gutiérrez/CNET

The US Commerce Department said Monday it's extending a temporary general license that allows American companies to do business with Huawei for another 90 days. This follows an initial 90-day reprieve, which started in May and was set to end Monday.

The department blacklisted Huawei following an executive order from President Donald Trump that effectively banned Huawei from US communications networks. It required American companies to get a license to do business with the Chinese telecom giant, which is the subject of national security concerns due to its cozy relationship with the Chinese government. Huawei has also announced that it's making its own mobile operating system.

""As we continue to urge consumers to transition away from Huawei's products, we recognize that more time is necessary to prevent any disruption,"" Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross said in a statement Monday. ""Simultaneously, we are constantly working at the department to ensure that any exports to Huawei and its affiliates do not violate the terms of the entity listing or temporary general license.""

The department also said another 46 Huawei subsidiaries have been added to the list due to national security concerns, bringing the total to more than 100 added since May, the department said.

Huawei called the US government's actions unjust and said the decision to put more of its subsidiaries on the entity list was politically motived.

""These actions violate the basic principles of free market competition,"" the company said in a statement on Monday. ""They are in no one's interests, including US companies.""

"Some jail staffers not cooperating with DOJ investigation into Epstein suicide, source says",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Vandana Rambaran', 'Vandana Rambaran Is A Reporter Covering News', 'Politics At Foxnews.Com. She Can Be Found On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/prison-personnel-refuse-to-cooperate-with-doj-investigators-digging-into-epstein-suicide,"Personnel at the New York City prison where accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein committed suicide last week have not been initially cooperative with investigators from the Department of Justice, a federal source told Fox News Friday.

Attorney General William Barr sent two senior DOJ officials to personally visit the Metropolitan Correctional Center and speak with staff from the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) in order to gather information on Epstein's death after Barr said officials uncovered ""serious irregularities"" at the jail, a senior DOJ official told Fox News. The officials have been on site since Thursday and the FBI and the Justice Department's inspector general are investigating conditions at the MCC.

NEW YORK MEDICAL EXAMINER: JEFFREY EPSTEIN'S DEATH WAS A SUICIDE BY HANGING

BOP officials from various regional offices have also been sent to the Manhattan facility to lend their expertise and insight. In addition, a separate BOP ""After Action Team"" went to MCC earlier this week in an effort to examine what happened the night Epstein died. The use of the ""After Action Team"" is part of BOP protocol whenever a ""significant event takes place at a prison.

Epstein was found dead in his cell on Aug. 10. Earlier Friday, New York City's medical examiner officially ruled the 66-year-old's death a suicide by hanging.

Fox News has also learned that 20 of 21 prison staff posts were filled between the hours of 4 p.m. and 12 a.m. on Friday, Aug. 9, the day before Epstein was found. Of those prison workers, six of them were working voluntary overtime. Between 12 a.m. and 8 a.m. on Saturday, Aug. 10, 18 of 19 staff posts were filled. Of those 18 staffers, 10 were working overtime and all but one of those were doing so voluntarily.

Conspiracy theories swirled following Epstein's death, as many wondered how the wealthy financier could have been able to kill himself in a high-security facility just over two weeks after being placed on suicide watch, though officials later confirmed Epstein had been taken off suicide watch shortly before his death.

Correctional officers did not check in with Epstein for ""several hours"" before his death, despite being required to visit him every 30 minutes, a person familiar with the situation told Fox News earlier this week.

Jail guards on duty the night of Epstein's death are also suspected of falsifying log entries to show they were checking on inmates every half-hour as required, The Associated Press reported, citing several people familiar with the matter.

Two staffers have been placed on administrative leave and the MCC's warden has been reassigned pending an investigation.

Late Friday, Epstein's attorneys issued a statement decrying what they described as ""the harsh, even medieval conditions at the MCC.""

""It is indisputable that the authorities violated their own protocols,"" Martin Weinberg, Reid Weingarten and Michael Miller said. ""The defense team fully intends to conduct its own independent and complete investigation into the circumstances and cause of Mr. Epstein’s death including if necessary legal action to view the pivotal videos - if they exist as they should - of the area proximate to Mr. Epstein's cell during the time period leading to his death.

""We are not satisfied with the conclusions of the medical examiner,"" the statement concluded. "" We will have a more complete response in the coming days
