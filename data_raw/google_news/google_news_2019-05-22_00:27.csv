"Angry Dem says Trump ‘raping the country,’ as impeachment push nears critical mass",https://www.foxnews.com,['Ronn Blitzer'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/angry-dem-says-trump-raping-the-country-as-impeachment-push-nears-critical-mass,"A rapid-fire string of developments has congressional Democrats putting increased pressure on party brass to launch impeachment proceedings against President Trump, with one rank-and-file lawmaker reportedly saying the president is “raping the country” and others indicating it's only a matter of time before leadership changes course on the politically fraught issue.

Amid the internal tensions, Speaker Nancy Pelosi called a special meeting of House Democrats for Wednesday morning, where the impeachment issue and other battles are expected to be discussed.

Prior meetings involving Pelosi and top Democrats held Monday evening escalated into heated exchanges, with the party torn over how to address Trump controversies -- most recently, the decision to block the former White House counsel from testifying. Democratic leaders, who for the most part have not been publicly in favor of impeachment, are now finding it difficult to maintain their position as calls grow from the ranks to flip that switch.

HOUSE JUDICIARY CHAIRMAN NADLER: TRUMP IS MAKING IT 'MORE DIFFICULT' NOT TO CONSIDER IMPEACHMENT

A senior House Democrat told Fox News late Monday that Pelosi “isn’t going to be able to hold off on impeachment much longer,” and that the speaker may have to change her position “within the next two weeks.”

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., while saying Pelosi is working to bring the party together, suggested Tuesday that politics are the main element preventing members from pressing ahead at this stage.

“Just as impeaching without cause could be construed, and is, politically motivated, choosing to not impeach when there is an abundance of cause could also be construed similarly,” she told reporters.

Rep. Steve Cohen, D-Tenn., reportedly confronted Pelosi during a Democratic Steering and Policy Committee meeting as he demanded the president's impeachment. According to Politico, Cohen said that while former President Bill Clinton was impeached “over sex,” Trump was “raping the country.”

Cohen reportedly suggested Pelosi is worried about politics in her reluctance to proceed, but Pelosi countered, “This isn’t about politics at all. It’s about patriotism.”

Cohen is among the most outspoken Trump critics in Congress. He drew attention by eating fried chicken during a recent House Judiciary Committee hearing as a commentary on Attorney General Bill Barr’s refusal to testify. Cohen referred to the attorney general as “Chicken Barr,” despite Barr having testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee the previous day. Cohen has also called for the House to use its inherent contempt power to throw Barr in the Capitol jail.

But as House Democrats weigh contempt proceedings for Barr, another fight broke out Monday after former White House Counsel Don McGahn was instructed by the president's team to defy a subpoena from the same committee. Democrats wanted him to testify regarding information he provided to the Special Counsel's Office, but the White House directed him not to appear, with the Justice Department asserting he has immunity from testimony about his official duties.

""The Democrats do not like the conclusion of the Mueller investigation – no collusion, no conspiracy, and no obstruction – and want a wasteful and unnecessary do-over,"" Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement.

House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., said after a closed-door meeting with Pelosi that Trump is “making it very difficult to avoid” considering impeachment.

Pelosi insisted that her party remains united, saying Tuesday that she's not feeling pressure from colleagues.

“There’s no divide,” she said a day earlier. “We’re fine. We’re good.”

Nadler, meanwhile, told CNN’s Chris Cuomo that he intends to hold McGahn in contempt of Congress for not complying with the subpoena. Nadler said the White House’s effort to keep McGahn from testifying was part of a pattern of “lawless behavior,” and Trump is “willing to go to any lengths to prevent testimony that might implicate him.”

Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., head of the Democratic Policy and Communications Committee, said Monday that McGahn’s failure to testify on Tuesday would be grounds for opening an impeachment inquiry.

In addition to fighting off Democratic efforts to have McGahn testify, the president is currently in the midst of legal battles over Democratic subpoenas for his personal records. He sued Deutsche Bank and Capitol One to block a subpoena for his banking records, and was also trying to keep documents from accounting firm Mazars USA away from Congress.

A judge ruled against Trump in the Mazars case on Monday, stating that the House Oversight Committee was entitled to view the documents. The main argument from the Trump administration has been that Democrats lack a legitimate legislative purpose for their inquiries, but Judge Amit Mehta ruled that the possibility of finding conflicts of interest in the administration or violations of the Constitution’s Foreign Emoluments Clause sufficed.

FEDERAL JUDGE SIDES WITH HOUSE DEMOCRATS OVER SUBPOENA FOR TRUMP'S FINANCIAL RECORDS

Pelosi touted Mehta’s ruling as a win, as well as a reason why impeachment is not necessary at this point.

“Today, we won our first case,” Pelosi reportedly said at the Steering and Policy Committee meeting. “We’ve been in this thing for almost five months and now we’re getting some results.”

Trump Expected to Pick Ken Cuccinelli for Immigration Policy Role,https://www.nytimes.com,"['Maggie Haberman', 'Zolan Kanno-Youngs']",05-21-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/21/us/politics/trump-ken-cuccinelli-immigration.html,"He is the second person to be given a prominent role in the Trump administration this month after publicly backing aggressive immigration policies on cable news, which Mr. Trump consumes with gusto. Mr. Trump named Mark Morgan, who was forced out as Border Patrol chief two days after Mr. Trump took office, to lead Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

Mr. Cuccinelli served as attorney general in Virginia from 2010 to 2014, running unsuccessfully for governor there in 2013. A prominent conservative, he supported Senator Ted Cruz of Texas for president in 2016, leading an effort to win over delegates to the party’s convention, including those supporting Mr. Trump. That kind of history has kept other officials from jobs they had hoped to get in the Trump administration.

Cecilia Muñoz, the director of the domestic policy council in the Obama administration, said the appointment of Mr. Cuccinelli was concerning given his support in the past for denying citizenship to American-born children of undocumented immigrants and for a proposal to allow employers to fire workers who do not speak English on the job.

“It’s hard to put into words,” Ms. Muñoz said. “The president is trying to send an ever tougher message, but ultimately these things are symbols just in the same way the wall is a symbol. Even if you are desperate to show how tough you are, you’re not likely to produce a policy that addresses the problems at the border or the interior.”

Mr. Cuccinelli and Kris Kobach, the former Kansas secretary of state, were both under consideration for the immigration role. But Mr. Cuccinelli was always seen within the White House as the favorite, and Mr. Kobach did not help his case with Mr. Trump and some of his advisers with a list of the 10 “requirements” he had for taking the job, including access to a government jet 24 hours a day, weekends off with his family in Kansas and a promise to be nominated for Mr. McAleenan’s job by November if he wanted it."
Trump’s troubling response to “lock them up!” chants during his Pennsylvania rally,https://www.vox.com,['May'],05-21-2019,2019,5,https://www.vox.com/2019/5/21/18633879/trump-montoursville-pennsylvania-rally-lock-them-up-bill-barr,"President Donald Trump’s reelection rallies might have found version 2.0 of their familiar “lock her up!” chants: “Lock them up!”

With special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation mostly in the rearview mirror and William Barr installed as the protective attorney general Trump hoped Jeff Sessions would be, the president went on the attack during his speech Monday evening in Montoursville, Pennsylvania, reviving his baseless treason accusations against the FBI and Democrats.

“We caught ’em — they were spying,” Trump said, referring to the counterintelligence investigation of his campaign that began in 2016 and followed normal procedures. “They were spying on our campaign. I’ll tell you what — if that ever happened to the other side, this thing would’ve been over two years ago, and you know, it would have been treason. They would’ve called it treason. And that’s what it is — it was treason. And it should never be allowed to happen to another president again. Ever, ever, ever.”

Trump’s accusation is transparently meritless, but that’s beside the point. Heading into his 2020 reelection campaign, Trump — with help from Barr — is trying to establish a narrative that the entire investigation into his campaign’s contacts with Russia stemmed from anti-Trump bias in the law enforcement and intelligence communities, not his campaign’s secretive contacts with people in the Kremlin’s orbit. Trump wants to portray himself as a victim and Obama-era officials as bad actors who had it out for him from the beginning.

Trump’s audience seemed ready to get on board, cheering his accusations of treason and then breaking out in “lock them up!” chants. Trump basked in the chants for a moment before threatening to sic Barr on law enforcement officials who investigated him.

“Well, we have a great new attorney general who is going to give it a very fair look,” Trump said.

Barr, for his part, doesn’t seem troubled by Trump’s threat to use trumped-up charges against his perceived political enemies. During an interview on Fox News last week, Barr hit back at Democratic leaders who accused him of lying under oath during his congressional testimony and seemed to threaten to investigate them, saying, “they may be concerned about the outcome of a review of what happened during the election.”

During an interview with the Wall Street Journal that was published on Monday, Barr insisted he’s protecting the presidency, not just Trump. Barr has already announced he’s launched an investigation into the origins of the FBI’s counterintelligence investigation of the Trump campaign.

The “lock them up!” chants weren’t the only time Trump’s fans called for summary imprisonment of his enemies on Monday night. When Trump brought up Hillary Clinton earlier during the rally, his audience responded with resounding boos and the classic “lock her up!” chants.

Trump’s latest rally came hours after he suffered a defeat in federal court

Trump’s rally came hours after Judge Amit Mehta of the DC District Court decisively ruled against Trump in his effort to prevent House Democrats from subpoenaing 10 years of his financial records from the accounting firm Mazars USA. While the White House is sure to appeal Mehta’s ruling, it indicates that Trump’s strategy of stonewalling all congressional subpoenas may be a losing one.

Asked about the ruling just before taking off to Pennsylvania for his rally, Trump suggested he doesn’t think he needs to listen to judges who were appointed by Democratic presidents.

“Well, we disagree with that ruling — it’s crazy,” Trump said. “This never happened to any other president ... it’s totally the wrong decision by obviously an Obama-appointed judge. He was a recent Obama-appointed judge.”

Trump 100 percent thinks he can just choose to ignore rulings from ""Obama-appointed"" judges.



""We disagree with that ruling ... it's totally the wrong decision by obviously an Obama-appointed judge. He was a recent Obama-appointed judge."" pic.twitter.com/ksyJcWWe1h — Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) May 20, 2019

But Mehta’s ruling opens by discussing how another president, James Buchanan, raised similar concerns about congressional oversight but ended up having to submit to it anyway — a history that contradicts Trump’s claim he’s being treated unfairly.

“Courts have grappled for more than a century with the question of the scope of Congress’s investigative power,” Mehta wrote. “The binding principle that emerges from these judicial decisions is that courts must presume Congress is acting in furtherance of its constitutional responsibility to legislate and must defer to congressional judgments about what Congress needs to carry out that purpose.”

Attorney General Barr is powerless to stop the DC District Court from ruling against Trump. But if the fight over subpoenas makes its way to the US Supreme Court — whose balance has shifted to the right due to Trump’s nominations of Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh — the extent to which Congress will be empowered to conduct oversight on a president who is clearly interested in using the powers of the state against his enemies is unclear.

""You know Winston Churchill famously said in his typical quotable fashion: 'jaw, jaw, jaw is always better than war, war, war,'"" the former secretary of state said when asked on Monday about Iran and President Trump's handling of that situation. She was attending a memorial service for Democratic Rep. Ellen Tauscher, who died in April.

While she didn't specifically mention Trump, her comments came as he threatened the rogue nation in an apparent response to its provocations.

""If Iran wants to fight, that will be the official end of Iran. Never threaten the United States again!"" he tweeted on Sunday.

Trump caught criticism, including from Clinton, in 2018 when he pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal that relieved sanctions in exchange for limits on the country's nuclear program.

""Pulling out of the Iran deal is a big mistake,"" she said in May of 2018. ""It makes America less safe and less trusted. Iran is now more dangerous.""

""That is what we did with the Iran negotiations -- put a lid on Iran's nuclear program,"" she said Monday in an apparent reference to her efforts during the Obama administration. ""That is what we should still be doing.""

Although Trump has threatened military action, he also has urged Iranians to come to the table and negotiate over its nuclear program. After Trump's threats, Iran announced it quadrupled its uranium-enrichment production but said it would keep production below the level mandated by the 2015 nuclear deal.

Senate Democrats on Tuesday hammered a top Treasury Department official over a bombshell report that Deutsche Bank resisted reporting suspicious financial activity tied to President Donald Trump and his son-in-law Jared Kushner, whose companies were clients of the German lender.

One after another, Democrats at a Senate Banking Committee hearing that focused on anonymous shell company abuse urged the director of Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, Kenneth Blanco, to take action on the New York Times story.

Story Continued Below

Blanco's agency, known as FinCEN, is responsible for policing illegal money laundering and would have received any so-called suspicious activity reports filed by Deutsche Bank. According to the Times, bank employees prepared the reports but were blocked by executives.

""The alleged facts are in plain sight,"" Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) said. ""It's essential it seems to me to the public trust and the integrity of FinCEN that these be actively pursued.""

Despite the pummeling by Democrats — not a single Republican at the hearing brought up Deutsche Bank — Blanco said he was unable to comment on allegations made in the story, which he said he had been briefed on but had not read.

""You're a very smart man,"" Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), responded. ""It wouldn't take very long to read it, but it might be very informative to you.""

""Just because it's in the newspaper doesn't mean it’s true,"" Blanco said. ""I'm not saying it's false, either.""

Blanco suggested that the bank might have been comfortable with the risks it was taking with Trump.

""Everything is fact-specific,"" he said. ""At the end of the day, it could be quite appropriate.""

Before Tuesday's hearing, Van Hollen and Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) wrote to Deutsche Bank CEO Christian Sewing asking him to confirm the accuracy of the Times story and to divulge how many suspicious activity reports were quashed.

Deutsche Bank has said there were ""numerous inaccuracies and misleading statements"" in the Times story but that legal restrictions prevented it from refuting them in detail."
E.P.A. Plans to Get Thousands of Pollution Deaths Off the Books by Changing Its Math,https://www.nytimes.com,['Lisa Friedman'],05-20-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/20/climate/epa-air-pollution-deaths.html,"Want climate news in your inbox? Sign up here for Climate Fwd:, our email newsletter.

WASHINGTON — The Environmental Protection Agency plans to change the way it calculates the health risks of air pollution, a shift that would make it easier to roll back a key climate change rule because it would result in far fewer predicted deaths from pollution, according to five people with knowledge of the agency’s plans.

The E.P.A. had originally forecast that eliminating the Obama-era rule, the Clean Power Plan, and replacing it with a new measure would have resulted in an additional 1,400 premature deaths per year. The new analytical model would significantly reduce that number and would most likely be used by the Trump administration to defend further rollbacks of air pollution rules if it is formally adopted.

The proposed shift is the latest example of the Trump administration downgrading the estimates of environmental harm from pollution in regulations. In this case, the proposed methodology would assume there is little or no health benefit to making the air any cleaner than what the law requires. Many experts said that approach was not scientifically sound and that, in the real world, there are no safe levels of the fine particulate pollution associated with the burning of fossil fuels.

Fine particulate matter — the tiny, deadly particles that can penetrate deep into the lungs and enter the bloodstream — is linked to heart attacks, strokes and respiratory disease."
DHS warns of 'strong concerns' that Chinese-made drones are stealing data,https://www.cnn.com,['David Shortell'],05-20-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/20/politics/dhs-chinese-drone-warning/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Chinese-made drones may be sending sensitive flight data to their manufacturers in China, where it can be accessed by the government there, the US Department of Homeland Security warned in an alert issued Monday obtained by CNN.

The drones are a ""potential risk to an organization's information,"" the alert from DHS's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency states. The products ""contain components that can compromise your data and share your information on a server accessed beyond the company itself.""

The report does not name any specific manufacturers, but nearly 80% of the drones used in the US and Canada come from DJI, which is headquartered in Shenzhen, China, according to one industry analysis. US local law enforcement organizations and infrastructure operators have grown to rely on drones in recent years.

""The United States government has strong concerns about any technology product that takes American data into the territory of an authoritarian state that permits its intelligence services to have unfettered access to that data or otherwise abuses that access,"" the alert says.

""Those concerns apply with equal force to certain Chinese-made (unmanned aircraft systems)-connected devices capable of collecting and transferring potentially revealing data about their operations and the individuals and entities operating them, as China imposes unusually stringent obligations on its citizens to support national intelligence activities,"" the alert adds.

I'm the same age as Elizabeth Warren. We 70-somethings have no business being president.,https://www.usatoday.com,"['Bonnie Goldstein', 'Opinion Contributor', 'Published A.M. Et May']",05-21-2019,2019,5,https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/voices/2019/05/21/2020-election-warren-biden-trump-sanders-age-column/3742249002/,"CLOSE

I have nothing against old people — I'm one of them. But maybe it's time to add a maximum age limit to our minimum age requirement for our presidents.

Next month, presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren and I will both turn 70. Warren will be the fourth septuagenarian officially in the race, joining Joe Biden (76), Bernie Sanders (77) and Donald Trump, who turns 73 on June 14. Personally, I am amazed to have chronologically made it this far. Those candidates and I were all born during the 1940s, which means we went though the 1980s as young adults.

That fact alone should disqualify all of us from running for president.

The '80s were exhilarating and then exhausting. As my crowd was coming of age and into positions of leadership, we had nearly limitless possibilities to define and achieve success. The war in Vietnam was over. We were allowed to take risks. We were unsupervised and unchecked, our privacy protected by analog obscurity. Boomers and our Warholian older brothers and sisters, were posing, positioning and philandering. We had loads of time to land on our feet and reinvent ourselves. Love was free. Cocaine was ubiquitous. Decadence had no consequences. We had only begun to hear about a blood disease that was affecting gay men.

I cast no aspersions on the emerging elderly for their youthful transgressions. My generation of geezers, through no fault of our own, lived our lives during the great social experiment that was the second half of the 20th century.

Growing up in the analogue era

In my 20s, I made countless poor choices that regularly led to spectacular failures (for example, in 1970, I moved to a beach in Sinaloa, Mexico, instead of going to college). As buffer to my habit of making impulsive decisions, I was absurdly lucky. I survived to my 30s and, by 1978, landed in post-Watergate Washington, D.C., with a grown-up career.

President Richard Nixon had resigned, and both the American government and I were getting a new start.

It turned out the times were an imperfect proving ground for noble intentions. The Reagan years were culturally flat, but politically stable and economically opportune. To quote Tom Petty, for the ambitious and energetic, ""the sky was the limit.""

Fast-forward to 2019. The past didn’t go anywhere. Archival time capsules are everywhere, and they highlight our midcentury midlife decision-making — when we were developing character.

While not everyone’s history is as colorful as these senior citizen contenders for 2020, for today’s spry 70-somethings, it can be terribly uncomfortable that our hard copy records have been transcribed, digitized, cataloged and made keyword-searchable. Seemingly anyone can unearth acts and interpret motivations of our younger selves and upload them to the internet.

Back while I was learning about politics in Washington, D.C., in Burlington, Vermont Sanders was fulfilling his civic duty as mayor. Coincidentally, both of us wrote down our interior thoughts on yellow legal pads. Mine are safely in my office closet stacked in a box full of self-recriminating scolds and personal pep talks in my handwriting about my work (challenging), friendships (mostly transactional) or parenting skills (lacking).

Awkwardly, Mayor Sanders’ similarly toned, excruciatingly personal midlife existential doubts ended up among his official mayoral records sent to storage at the University of Vermont after he left office, along with, Mother Jones reports, “bank statements, an overdue gas bill, and a letter from an acquaintance asking Sanders to pay back $250 he had borrowed seven years earlier.”

This month, more than three decades later, the now three-term senator and eight-term congressman’s humanizing but hardly helpful notes-to-self ended up published. Mother Jones reported that the frustrated municipal chief, approaching middle age, complained to himself that he was losing his radical touch and maintaining a socialist “vision is extremely difficult when one is confronted on every corner with the … suffocating force of the status quo.”

Business values of the 1980s

While Sanders was stewing over the meaning of his life in the mid-1980s, 300 miles south, Trump, a self-styled mogul and beneficiary of the equivalent of $4.5 million a year from his father’s clever generosity, was on a debt-fueled spending spree to build his own real estate and gambling empire in New York and Atlantic City.

Any interior thoughts during the mid-80s that media darling Donald Trump might have had have so far been shielded from snoopy reporters (and congresspersons) by nondisclosure agreements, sealed lawsuits and, perhaps, his early passion for “getting even.”

President Donald Trump speaks to the media in Washington on May 14. 2019. (Photo: JIM LO SCALZO, EPA-EFE)

Some light has recently been shed, however, on his business acumen. The New York Times obtained printouts from his official IRS tax transcripts, from 1985 through 1994. The Times calculated that Trump claimed $1.17 billion in losses for the period. Claiming these losses allowed Trump to avoid paying income tax for eight of the 10 years.

In response to this public peek into his early approach to playing the system, the 72-year-old first-term president said real estate developers were “entitled to massive write-offs,"" and ""you always wanted to show losses for tax purposes."" Apparently, loading up on loopholes was a common “sport” among real estate developers.

Thanks to my generation’s harrowing histories, our compromised conditions and our diminished drive, the field of members competent to sit in the Oval Office has narrowed. That’s as it should be. We are admittedly not as fresh as we once were.

The future might rest on electing a sufficiently “woke” candidate who can connect with a gender-fluid generation, plus set a deadline to save the planet and also develop policies to protect Americans from violence.

Boomers and the truly elderly added much to the culture of our era, but in these troubled times it seems right to me that we elect a candidate who will make appropriate choices for his or her contemporaries, and the ones who will follow. As I blow out my many birthday candles, I’ll wish for an election that features fresh ideas.

For the long term, maybe we should consider an age limit to bookend the constitutional provision making 35 years old the minimum threshold for presidential authority. A reasonable maximum might be 70 (or possibly 75 to accommodate the many geezers who would want to be grandfathered in).

The millions would reportedly include $50 million set aside by the TSA to buy advanced airport screening equipment and $64 million from a worker’s compensation fund set aside for injured employees. Bizarrely, it would also include $3 million of loose change left in trays at airports. Money for Transportation Security Officers, who run security screening lines in airports, is also “in play,” according to leaked internal docs, which could cause significant disruption over the summer if reallocated.

“He feels like we have betrayed him because we’re not nicer to him in his view,” Baker, who is the newspaper’s chief White House correspondent, told Hill.TV during an interview that aired Tuesday.

“And we have to explain that’s not our job, we don’t do nice stories or bad stories, we just do truth and accurate if we can,” he continued, adding that covering Trump is “so personal.”

Baker said that despite Trump's repeated attacks calling the press the “enemy of the people,” the president often tries to ""charm"" members of the media to get them “on his side.”

“There is this thing when he sits down with an individual or a reporter to try to charm them, to try to get them on his side,” he told Hill.TV.

Trump has long held a contentious relationship with the mainstream media, repeatedly lashing out at various news outlets. The New York Times is a frequent focus of his ire—he refers to the paper as the ""failing"" New York Times.

In a series of tweets on Monday, Trump renewed attacks against the Times over a report concerning some of his financial transactions.

According to the Times report, Deutsche Bank employees flagged several possible suspicious transactions by entities controlled by Trump and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner Jared Corey KushnerOn The Money: Judge upholds House subpoena for Trump financial records | Trump vows to appeal ruling by 'Obama-appointed judge' | Canada, Mexico lift retaliatory tariffs on US | IRS audit rate falls The Hill's 12:30 Report: Amash under fire after impeachment tweets Ann Coulter: Four myths the media and politicians tell you about our border crisis MORE.

Trump slammed the report and refuted its findings.

“The Failing New York Times (it will pass away when I leave office in 6 years), and others of the Fake News Media, keep writing phony stories about how I didn’t use many banks because they didn’t want to do business with me. WRONG! It is because I didn’t need money,” he tweeted.

The Times’ financial editor later disputed Trump’s claim that he could have done business with any bank, saying Deutsche Bank was the only one willing to lend to him.

""I have spent a long time looking into this, and @DeutscheBank was the only bank willing to lend to @realDonaldTrump for 20 years because of his pattern of defaults and the bank’s hunger for growth in the US,"" he tweeted.

"McGahn confirms he will skip House hearing, as DOJ asserts 'immunity' and Nadler fumes",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Brooke Singman', 'Brooke Singman Is A Politics Reporter For Fox News. Follow Her On Twitter At']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/white-house-mcgahn-house-hearing,"President Trump has directed former White House Counsel Don McGahn to skip a House Judiciary Committee hearing scheduled for Tuesday, citing a Justice Department opinion that he cannot be compelled to testify about his official duties -- and, through his legal team, McGahn confirmed Monday evening that he won't appear.

The development prompted an obstinate response late Monday from House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y.: “We are having the hearing tomorrow and we’re expecting Mr. McGahn to show pursuant to the subpoena.""

Earlier this month, House Democrats opted to question an empty chair -- and a bucket of fried chicken -- when Attorney General Bill Barr failed to appear, citing Democrats' unusual demands.

In a letter to Nadler, McGahn attorney William Burck said his client won't show up. Burck said current White House Counsel Pat Cipollone had communicated that Trump had instructed McGahn not to testify, and that Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel Steven Engel had said McGahn was immune from testifying.

""Mr. McGahn understands from your prior correspondence that the Committee would vote to hold him in contempt should he not appear tomorrow and the House of Representatives may follow suit,"" Burck wrote to Nadler. ""While we disagree with the Committee’s position and hope it will instead seek an accommodation with the White House, Mr. McGahn also must honor his ethical and legal obligations as a former senior lawyer and senior advisor to the President. In short, it is our view that the Committee’s dispute is not with Mr. McGahn but with the White House.""

Burck added: ""Mr. McGahn remains obligated to maintain the status quo and respect the President’s instruction. In the event an accommodation is agreed between the Committee and the White House, Mr. McGahn will of course comply with that accommodation.""

In a statement released Monday afternoon, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders blasted Democrats for continuing to pursue Trump investigations, saying they want a ""wasteful and unnecessary do-over"" in the wake of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's probe -- and describing the subpoena for McGahn as part of that.

""The House Judiciary Committee has issued a subpoena to try and force Mr. McGahn to testify again. The Department of Justice has provided a legal opinion stating that, based on long-standing, bipartisan, and Constitutional precedent, the former Counsel to the President cannot be forced to give such testimony, and Mr. McGahn has been directed to act accordingly,"" Sanders said. ""This action has been taken in order to ensure that future Presidents can effectively execute the responsibilities of the Office of the Presidency.""

The related DOJ memo said McGahn, like other senior advisers to a president, has ""immunity"" from being compelled to testify about his official duties.

""This immunity applies to the former White House Counsel. Accordingly, Mr. McGahn is not legally required to appear and testify about matters related to his official duties as Counsel to the President,"" the memo said.

The New York Times first reported that the president would likely direct McGahn to skip the hearing.

HOUSE JUDICIARY CHAIRMAN SUBPOENAS EX-WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL DON MCGAHN

The committee announced the hearing last week, but it was unclear whether McGahn would appear due to the ongoing battle between congressional Democrats and the White House over his testimony.

Earlier this month, Sanders said she did not “anticipate” that a hearing would take place. “We consider this to be a case closed and we’re moving forward to do the work of the American people,” Sanders said on ABC News’ “The Investigation” podcast.

The committee, led by Nadler, subpoenaed McGahn on April 22, days after the release of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report, which featured McGahn prominently in its section related to the obstruction of justice inquiry. This included a claim that McGahn disobeyed Trump’s call to have him seek Mueller’s removal.

“On June 17, 2017, the president called [White House Counsel Don] McGahn at home and directed him to call the Acting Attorney General and say that the Special Counsel had conflicts of interest and must be removed. McGahn did not carry out the direction, however, deciding that he would resign rather than trigger what he regarded as a potential Saturday Night Massacre,” the report stated, referencing the Watergate scandal.

The report also revealed that when the media reported on the president’s request, the president directed White House officials “to tell McGahn to dispute the story and create a record stating he had not been ordered to have the special counsel removed.” He did not.

The House committee's subpoena, coming amid a fight over access to the unredacted Mueller report, called for McGahn to appear before the panel to testify and provide documents related to the Mueller investigation.

But earlier this month, Cipollone first notified the committee that McGahn would not be allowed to comply with the subpoena, saying requests for documents and materials must go to the White House.

“The White House provided these records to Mr. McGahn in connection with its cooperation with the Special Counsel’s investigation and with the clear understanding that the records remain subject to the control of the White House for all purposes,” Cipollone wrote. “The White House records remain legally protected from disclosure under longstanding constitutional principles, because they implicate significant Executive Branch confidentiality interests and executive privilege.”

HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE SCHEDULES HEARING FOR DON MCGAHN, DESPITE WHITE HOUSE MOVE TO BLOCK SUBPOENA

He added: “Because Mr. McGahn does not have the legal right to disclose these documents to third parties, I would ask the Committee to direct any request for such records to the White House, the appropriate legal custodian.”

Cipollone wrote that acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney “has directed Mr. McGahn not to produce these White House records,” adding that the Justice Department concurs with their legal position.

But Nadler has stressed the importance of McGahn’s testimony, saying it would “help shed further light on the president’s attacks on the rule of law, and his attempts to cover up those actions by lying to the American people and requesting others to do the same.”

Trump, though, said he never told McGahn to fire Mueller, and tweeted last month that if he “wanted to fire Mueller, I didn’t need McGahn to do it, I could have done it myself.""

The battle over McGahn's testimony is just one front in the clash between the White House and congressional Democrats.

Earlier this month, the committee voted to hold Barr in contempt for defying a subpoena for Mueller's full and unredacted report, as well as underlying evidence and documents used in the investigation.

Trump, prior to the vote, asserted executive privilege over the materials in a bid to protect them from being turned over to the committee. The full House has yet to take a final vote on whether to hold Barr in contempt of Congress.

The Trump Administration Is Burying Evidence Its Coal Plan Will Kill Thousands,https://www.vanityfair.com,"['Bess Levin', 'Vanity Fair']",,,,https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/05/trump-epa-coal-plan-deaths,"Last August, the soot fetishists in the Trump administration released a proposal to prop up dying coal plants by giving states free rein to come up with their own rules, or let them petition to opt out of profit-killing regulations altogether. Among the many problems with Donald Trump’s “Affordable Clean Energy rule”? Technical analysis from his own Environmental Protection Agency showed that whereas Barack Obama’s Clean Power Plan was expected to prevent between 1,500 and 3,600 premature deaths annually by 2030, Trump’s replacement would cause as many as 1,400 premature deaths (just in America) each year. To many people, that seemed like a lot! So the administration has come up with a new tactic to get the nation on board. No, it’s not to keep Obama’s plan in place or to actually make sources of human-killing dirty energy comply with any sort of legitimate oversight. Instead, it’s to ignore science to get those pesky predicted deaths out of future disclosures.

The New York Times reports that the E.P.A. plans to “get thousands of deaths off the books,” not by doing anything to actually prevent those deaths, but by altering “the way it calculates the health risks of air pollution,” which would “make it easier to roll back a key climate-change rule.” (According to reporter Lisa Friedman, “The E.P.A. . . . is normally expected to demonstrate that society will see more benefits than costs” from a rule change, and apparently some people don’t get that killing off four figures’ worth of Americans per annum is a worthy trade-off for increased corporate profits.) Naturally, experts say the new modeling method is “not scientifically sound,” a situation that obviously poses no concern for this White House:

The proposed shift is the latest example of the Trump administration downgrading the estimates of environmental harm from pollution in regulations. In this case, the proposed methodology would assume there is little or no health benefit to making the air any cleaner than what the law requires. . . . in the real world, there are no safe levels of the fine particulate pollution associated with the burning of fossil fuels.

Fine particulate matter—the tiny, deadly particles that can penetrate deep into the lungs and enter the bloodstream—is linked to heart attacks, strokes, and respiratory disease.

The five people familiar with the plan, all current or former E.P.A. officials, said the new modeling method would appear in the agency’s analysis of the final version of the replacement regulation . . . which is expected to be made public in June.

Jonathan M. Samet, the dean of the Colorado School of Public Health, said that the most recent studies show negative health effects far below the 12-microgram safety threshold set by the E.P.A. “It’s not a hard stop where we can say ‘below that, air is safe.’ That would not be supported by the scientific evidence,” Samet told the Times. Richard L. Revesz, an expert in environmental law at New York University, added, “Particulate matter is extremely harmful and it leads to a large number of premature deaths,” calling the expected change a “monumental departure” with “significant impact” that would likely lay the groundwork for gutting more environmental regulations in the future. William L. Wehrum—who, it will surely surprise you to hear, worked as a lobbyist and lawyer for chemical manufacturers and fossil-fuel businesses before joining the E.P.A.—would just as soon take his industry cronies’ word for it:

. . . fossil-fuel advocates ask, why should the E.P.A. search for health dangers, and, ultimately, impose costs on industry, in situations where air is officially considered safe? Wehrum, who worked as a lawyer and lobbyist for chemical manufacturers and fossil-fuel businesses before moving to the E.P.A., echoed that position in two interviews. He noted that, in some regulations, the benefits of reduced particulate matter have been estimated to total in the range of $40 billion.

“How in the world can you get $30 or $40 billion of benefit to public health when most of that is attributable to reductions in areas that already meet a health-based standard,” he said. “That doesn’t make any sense.”

Actual scientists say it makes total sense, noting that standards for particulate matter are a lot like speed limits; while 65 miles per hour is typically “considered reasonable” to prevent deaths, it doesn’t mean that an accident couldn’t happen at lower speeds. There are reasons not to force people to drive at 20 or 25 miles per hour on the highway, and most people accept the risk of driving at 65. In this case, however, the administration is in the uncomfortable position of arguing that the risk here—1,400 people dying every year—is worth it, purely to allow the fossil-fuel industry to make some extra cash. Even someone as dumb as Trump knows that’s a hard sell.

Cheating on your taxes?

If you’re among the ultra-rich, you’re probably in the clear!

The Internal Revenue Service audited just 0.59 percent of individual tax returns last year, marking the seventh consecutive annual decline as the tax agency copes with smaller budgets and fewer workers. . . . Audits of the highest-income households dropped sharply, to their lowest levels since the I.R.S. began reporting that data in 2008. In fiscal 2018, the I.R.S. audited 6.66 percent of returns of filers with more than $10 million in adjusted gross income, down from 14.52 percent in 2017. Among households with income between $1 million and $5 million, the audit rate dropped from 3.52 percent to 2.21 percent.

Last year, an investigation by ProPublica revealed that a person making $20,000 a year and claiming the earned-income tax credit was much more likely to be audited than someone making 20 times that amount. So if you’re dodging taxes and are a cartoon villain who hates the poor, this is doubly good news.

How’s Trump’s trade war going?

Well, on Monday, more than 170 retailers, including Adidas and Nike, signed a letter begging him not to impose a threatened 25 percent tariff on footwear that could cost consumers an estimated $7 billion a year. Also on Monday, Morgan Stanley predicted that no trade deal plus further tariffs, which Trump is considering, could cause a global recession. Meanwhile, China has indicated that it has no intention of backing down anytime soon:

China’s government looks to be settling in for a long trade war with the United States, with President Xi Jinping invoking one of the Communist Party’s most epic—and ultimately successful—battles. The Chinese leader, accompanied by his top trade negotiator, Vice Premier Liu He, on Monday placed a floral basket at a monument in Jiangxi province commemorating the start of the Long March in 1934. In the 4,000-mile, year-long trek, the Communists broke through Nationalist lines, eventually ousting them and installing Mao Zedong as leader of China.

Meanwhile, China’s main movie channel, CCTV-6, has scrapped its regular programming in favor of films about the Korean War, which ended in a draw after China intervened to push back the Americans. . . . The planned coverage of the Asian Film Awards was ditched Friday for the classic war movie Heroic Sons and Daughters, the story of Chinese “volunteer troops” who helped North Korea fight the Americans in the 1950s. Then, over the weekend, came three more movies about resisting the United States: Battle on Shangganling Mountain and Surprise Attack. Another classic, the 1960 film Guards on the Railway Line, about Chinese scouts rooting out spies who work for the Americans, was due to screen Monday night.

Oh, and a song about the trade war—an extremely niche genre—has reportedly gone viral and includes the lyrics: “If the perpetrator wants to fight, we will beat him out of his wits.” So you might say Trump’s trade war isn’t going great!

The White House would really prefer that a witness to Trump’s attempts to obstruct justice not speak with House Democrats

It’s almost as though the administration has something to hide:

Trump on Monday directed former White House counsel Donald F. McGahn II to defy a congressional subpoena and skip a hearing scheduled for Tuesday, “denying House Democrats testimony one of the most important eyewitnesses to Trump’s attempts to obstruct the Russia investigation.”

Since last month’s release of the 448-page redacted report by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III, Democrats have sought for Mr. McGahn to publicly give his account of Mr. Trump’s attempts to thwart investigators. . . . Democrats hoped that hearing directly from Mr. McGahn in a televised hearing would help galvanize public opposition to Mr. Trump.

Mueller cited McGahn more than any other witness in his report on whether the president obstructed justice. In interviews with the special counsel’s investigators, McGahn detailed several episodes including an effort to oust Mueller—that showed the president intent on using his position atop the executive branch to protect himself from the Russia inquiry.

During his own testimony, Attorney General William Barr claimed it was “not a crime” for the president to instruct McGahn to lie to investigators about Trump’s attempt to fire Mueller, a legal opinion many have taken issue with.

The Justice Department might kill T-Mobile and Sprint’s merger despite likely FCC approval,https://www.theverge.com,['May'],05-20-2019,2019,5,https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/20/18632938/justice-department-against-tmobile-sprint-merger-deal-block-fcc,"T-Mobile and Sprint started the day with very good news when FCC chairman Ajit Pai said he would urge the commission to approve their industry-transforming merger. Stocks of both companies soared soon after. But only a few hours later, Bloomberg is reporting that the US Department of Justice is leaning toward blocking the merger over antitrust concerns. This isn’t the first time we’ve heard that the Justice Department remains unconvinced that a combined T-Mobile and Sprint would be a positive development for consumers.

Citing a person familiar with the DoJ’s ongoing merger review, Bloomberg says that “the remedies proposed by the companies don’t go far enough to resolve antitrust concerns.” T-Mobile and Sprint agreed to several “enforceable” commitments and milestones on 5G deployment throughout the US in order to gain the FCC’s thumbs-up on the deal; Boost Mobile will also be sold off if the merger is successful. In a video, T-Mobile CEO John Legere insisted that the combined company would face hefty financial penalties if it fails to meet those 5G buildout goals. He also again pledged that consumers wouldn’t face higher mobile plan prices for at least three years.

But the Justice Department’s antitrust division is the crucial hurdle — and a bigger one than the FCC in this case — that T-Mobile and Sprint must overcome if they want to see the $26.5 billion merger through. Those same conditions that Pai found acceptable might not be enough to get a stamp of approval from antitrust officials. Trading of Sprint’s stock was briefly halted for volatility on Monday afternoon after Bloomberg’s story was published.

Both T-Mobile and Sprint say their coming together is critical for the United States to be a leader in 5G mobile networking and to present a more formidable competitor to larger rivals Verizon Wireless and AT&T. Critics maintain that shrinking the number of major US mobile providers from four down to three will result in higher prices and lost jobs, regardless of what T-Mobile and Sprint are promising. When The Wall Street Journal originally reported that the Justice Department was turning against the merger, Legere and Sprint CEO Marcelo Claure strongly pushed back against the story and claimed it was inaccurate. But now Bloomberg is corroborating that this thing is still far from a certainty."
Commerce Dept. grants Huawei a 90-day license to help existing users,https://www.engadget.com,[],05-20-2019,2019,5,https://www.engadget.com/2019/05/20/huawei-temp-license/,"Last week the US Commerce Department added Huawei and 68 subsidiaries to its ""Entity List"" that bans it from doing business with US companies without a special license. Today, as anticipated, the Commerce Department loosened that restriction a bit with a temporary 90-day license. According to Wilbur Ross, the Secretary of Commerce, it ""will allow operations to continue for existing Huawei mobile phone users and rural broadband networks.""

Because many operators, or owners of various handsets might not have any other way to get software updates or look into backups for necessary equipment, Huawei can continue to service those existing customers -- for now at least. For the long term, however, it's still looking at the loss of access to technology like Google's Android OS, not to mention any business deals in the US.

Update: Huawei CEO Ren Zhengfei made a rare public statement, telling media in China that his company had already made preparations for a ban, and said that its 5G would not be affected by the restrictions. He also said the temporary license ""bears little meaning."""
"GM's over-the-air updates, EPA's new math, hydrogen from seawater: Today's Car News",https://www.greencarreports.com,[],,,,https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1123198_gms-over-the-air-updates-epas-new-math-hydrogen-from-seawater-todays-car-news,"



EPA Acting Administrator Andrew Wheeler

The EPA plans to stop counting potential lives saved from new pollution rules. GM reveals a platform that's connected to the future. Stanford scientists devise a way to use seawater to make hydrogen. And our latest Twitter poll asks what types of incentives work best to sell EVs. All this and more on Green Car Reports.

In its latest effort to unwind the Obama administration's Clean Power Plan, the EPA is considering a new analytical model that will quit counting thousands of lives potentially saved by cleaning up the air, according to a new report in The New York Times.

GM introduced a new electrical architecture expected to go into most of its cars by 2023, which can provide faster communications for electric drive systems, self-driving, and infotainment, with future expandability and Tesla-style over-the-air updates.

How to make enough hydrogen is one of the main challenges with fuel-cell cars. Getting it from water, in addition to requiring a lot of energy, could stress water supplies. Now scientists at Stanford have figured out how to make lots of it from seawater. That leaves several other challenges unsolved, however.

After checking out how Norway managed to find success with electric cars, our latest Twitter poll asks, ""What kinds of EV incentives are most effective?""

Spy photographers from our partners at Motor Authority have caught images of the new Chevy Bolt–based electric SUV from GM out testing on public roads. The new model, which could be called the Bolt EUV, is expected to be built alongside the Bolt EV in 2021.

Finally, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles recalled almost 200,000 Chrysler Pacifica minivans—but not the Pacifica Hybrid this time—for an electrical problem that could lead to a stall or a lack of power-steering assistance.

DES MOINES, Iowa — U.S. corn farmers have the most corn acres left to plant, on this date, than they have ever had and remain behind the trade’s expectations, as well.

In its Crop Progress Report Monday, the USDA pegged U.S. corn planting at 49% complete, behind the 80% five-year average.

The trade expected a completion rating of 53%. On this week of the planting season, the most that U.S. farmers have ever had left was 47% of the crop. In 2019, that amount is 51%, with plenty of rain in the Midwest’s forecast.

As of Sunday, Iowa farmers had 70% of that state’s corn crop planted vs. a 89% five-year average. Illinois farmers have 24% of their corn seeded, behind a 89% five-year average. Indiana has 14% planted vs. a 73% five-year average. In the eastern Corn Belt, Nebraska farmers have 70% of their corn planted vs. a 86% five-year average.

Also, 19% of the U.S. corn has emerged vs. a 49% five-year average.

Cuccinelli is not expected to take on the role of ""immigration czar,"" a position President Donald Trump had considered establishing to improve coordination between the agencies involved in handling the steep uptick in migrants crossing the US's southern border in recent months.

But Trump and White House officials hope Cuccinelli, a politically savvy immigration hardliner, will ensure the White House's immigration priorities are being carried out at the Department of Homeland Security.

There are few Senate-confirmed appointees in the top roles at the DHS, which some White House officials argue has slowed them down in advancing their policies.

Since he became acting secretary, Kevin McAleenan brought in several officials from Customs and Border Protection whom the White House did not view as immigration hardliners. Cuccinelli's appointment will help even that out, officials say.

DOJ reveals name of ex-US attorney accused of sexual misconduct after BuzzFeed lawsuit,https://thehill.com,[],05-20-2019,2019,5,https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/444620-doj-reveals-name-of-ex-us-attorney-accused-of-sexual-misconduct-after,"The Justice Department has revealed the name of a former U.S. attorney accused of misconduct after BuzzFeed News successfully sued for disclosure of his identity.

The Justice Department announced in May 2017 that the since-retired attorney had an affair with a subordinate, created a hostile work environment and possibly violated department policy on sexual harassment. A federal judge ruled in March that public interest superseded government officials’ right to privacy, forcing the Justice Department to disclose last week the attorney in question was Stephen Wigginton, who served as U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Illinois from 2010 to 2015. Wigginton was also charged with driving under the influence and causing a car crash in 2017.

In the March ruling, U.S. District Judge Vernon Broderick ruled the Justice Department omitted key details in arguing Wigginton’s case only involved an “improper consensual relationship.”

“Instead, the improper relationship was so open and obvious that it caused employees within the Office to feel powerless, embarrassed, and distracted, and resulted in a work environment that some described as unbearable and hostile,” Broderick wrote. “In addition to work environment issues, the conduct had an impact on the operations of the Office since it resulted in disparate treatment regarding bonuses and disciplinary actions, and led some to avoid the U.S. Attorney and Supervisory AUSA at all costs.”

“Following the OIG’s investigation into this matter, the Department took appropriate steps to assess and address the issues outlined in the OIG’s report,” a Justice Department spokesperson told BuzzFeed. “The department has complete confidence in the new leadership and overall professionalism of the [US attorney’s office] in the Southern District of Illinois.”

The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Hill."
DOD: Iranian Threats ‘Put on Hold’ Thanks to U.S.,https://www.nationalreview.com,"['Mairead Mcardle', 'Andrew C. Mccarthy', 'George Will', 'Rich Lowry', 'John Fund', 'David French', 'Seth J.

(Carlo Allegri/Reuters)

The Department of Defense said Tuesday that potential threats from Iran have been “put on hold” thanks to precautionary measures taken by the U.S.

“We have put on hold the potential for attacks on Americans,” Acting Secretary of Defense Pat Shanahan said at the Pentagon.

The U.S. deployed four B-52 bombers, Patriot air-defense missiles, and the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier-strike group to the Persian Gulf earlier this month amid fears that Iran was transporting short-range ballistic missiles in the region. Shanahan cited “indications of a credible threat by Iranian regime forces” in justifying the move.

The State Department last week ordered all non-critical government employees to leave Iraq, saying the tensions with neighboring Iran could endanger Americans in the area. Additionally, a rocket was fired Sunday night which landed less than a mile from the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. No one claimed responsibility for the attack, and no casualties occurred.

“There haven’t been any attacks on Americans,” Shanahan confirmed. “That doesn’t mean that the threats that we’ve previously identified have gone away. Our prudent response, I think, has given the Iranians time to recalculate.

The Environmental Protection Agency is reportedly planning to do the latter by adopting a new method for projecting the future health risks of air pollution. The new method has not been been peer-reviewed and is not scientifically sound, The New York Times reports, citing five people said to have knowledge of the plan. The change would drastically lower an estimate made last year by the Trump administration that as many as 1,400 more people could die prematurely each year under a proposed new rule on emissions from coal plants. Lowering the projections would make it much easier to defend the new regulation, known as the Affordable Clean Energy rule. “Particulate matter is extremely harmful and it leads to a large number of premature deaths,” said Richard L. Revesz, an expert in environmental law at New York University. He called the expected change a “monumental departure” from the approach used over the past several decades."
"WV MetroNews Suit led by Jay Justice claims OSM broke settlement deal, preempts another federal lawsuit",http://wvmetronews.com,['Brad Mcelhinny'],05-21-2019,2019,5,http://wvmetronews.com/2019/05/21/suit-led-by-jay-justice-claims-osm-broke-settlement-deal-preempts-another-federal-lawsuit/,"By Brad McElhinny in News | May 21, 2019 at 3:41PM

CHARLESTON, W.Va. — Companies owned by the family of Gov. Jim Justice have filed a lawsuit against the federal Office of Surface Mining, apparently preempting another impending lawsuit by the U.S. Department of Justice.

The lawsuit by Justice companies contends the agency acted in bad faith by reversing course on a settlement deal. Lawyers for the Justice companies also insinuate the federal government may be acting out a political vendetta.

This is the second legal showdown this month between Justice companies and an agency of the federal government over defaulting penalties.

A separate lawsuit by the U.S. Department of Justice and the Mine Safety and Health Administration was filed on May 7. That one contended Justice companies owe $4.7 million for 2,297 citations over five years.

That action is an aspect of why Justice companies contend they are being treated unfairly.

Office of the Governor Gov. Jim Justice

Governor Justice described unnamed political forces on May 8 when reporters asked for his reaction to the MSHA lawsuit.

“You know, we’re getting ready to go into an election year. You don’t really know where stuff comes from,” the governor said. “But at the end of the day, we’ll take care of our obligations. We always have and we always will.”

The lawsuit filed May 17 by Justice companies against the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement also makes reference to possible political motives.

The lawsuit contends the two parties had agreed to settle fines, reclamation fees and penalties when that agency suddenly started playing hardball.

“The abrupt turnaround by the government in its attitude toward this matter is inexplicable and raises the question whether untoward political or other pressure from sources presently unknown has been brought to bear on OSMRE, perhaps from other federal agencies or political adversaries of the Justice family,” the lawsuit states.

The lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Virginia. Senior Judge Glen Conrad was assigned.

Documents within the filing allude to a possible impending lawsuit against Justice companies by the U.S. Department of Justice on behalf of OSM. If so, that would mirror the earlier lawsuit on behalf of MSHA.

An attached May 13 letter by Mike Carey, a lawyer for Justice and his companies, is addressed to the U.S. Department of Interior.

“I understand from discussions with your office last week that the filing of one or more complaints is imminent,” Carey wrote. “This is of grave concern and bewilderment to my clients. We believe it is unecessary, as we have now met every term your requested to settle this matter.

“If a file has been forwarded to the Department of Justice, I request that this correspondence be immediately provided to the individuals working on this matter and that they be notified we have agreed to all of the OSM’s settlement demands.”

Carey also represents the Justice companies on the MSHA lawsuit. And he represents the Governor’s Office on the lawsuit over whether Justice violates the state Constitution’s requirement to reside at the seat of government. Plus the Governor’s Office used Carey’s firm last year to investigate its own Department of Commerce.

A response to Carey by the Department of the Interior on May 15 also alludes to an impending federal lawsuit.

“Yesterday afternoon, a letter authorizing DOJ to file suit against the Justice Companies on behalf of the Department of Interior was signed and sent (the end of a process that has taken months to accomplish — the MSHA lawsuit plays no part in DOI’s referral to DOJ),” wrote John Austin of the Interior department.

“If your clients want to settle these cases before suit is filed, please make an offer that we can discuss with DOJ.”

The lawsuit filed by Justice companies contends another federal lawsuit would further damage the companies’ reputation.

“Any suit filed by the government in contravention of the Settlement Agreement would create a false impression and arguably be defamatory in that it would cause harm to the business and personal reputations of the Plaintiffs,” lawyers for the Justice companies wrote.

This has resulted from dozens of violations by several Justice companies recorded by OSM in recent years. A spreadsheet in the filing lists 114, but does not indicate their nature or a dollar value.

Eleven of the violations name Jay Justice, the governor’s son who runs the coal operation.

“For what is believed to be the first time ever, the OSMRE also wrongfully assessed a series of individual assessments against Jay Justice personally, allegedly relating to the activities of the Justice Mining Entities,” according to the lawsuit by Justice companies.

Negotiations by Justice company representatives, including Jay, and officials with OSM picked up in early April, according to the lawsuit.

The lawsuit says Jay Justice and Tom Lusk, chief operating officer of Justice Mining Entities, met with Michael Castle, the field office director for OSM in Knoxville and Lexington, plus Mark Snyder, also with OSM.

The lawsuit indicates they meet several times April 8, sometimes with counsel and sometimes without.

Much of the conversation focused on Justice companies completing reclamation work in lieu of financial penalties. Part of the negotiation focused on whether the companies would need to provide additional financial information or collateral.

By late that month, according to Justice companies, significant expense had been expended to move equipment and start the reclamation work.

This month, according to Justice companies, the attitude of the federal government seemed to change.

“In the week of May 6, 2019, the government’s attitude toward the Justice Mining Entities noticeably soured,” lawyers for the company stated, noting the lawsuit that was filed by MSHA and the Department of Justice.

That filing prompted Austin of the Department of Interior to question whether Justice companies would be able to perform their duties under the settlement agreement, according to the Justice lawsuit.

In the May 15 letter, Austin stated that there had not been an authorized agreement to settle the penalties with OSM.

“I need to reiterate what you and your clients have been told: Neither OSMRe nor any of its employees nor the attorneys representing the Secretary of the Interior have authority to settle a debt owed to the United States that exceeds $100,000 without the approval of the U.S. Department of Justice.”

The Justice companies contended that playing hardball will mean the loss of mining jobs.

“As the plaintiffs previously made OMSRE and its attorneys aware, preceding litigiously instead of in accordance with the Settlement Agreement harms the operations of a dozen or so mining companies and risks the jobs of hundred of workers on the pending reclamation projects,” Justice company lawyers wrote.

The Department of Interior would like proof. It wants financial statements and any other information the company can provide to demonstrate a settlement is in the best interest of citizens.

“We will also need documentation of your belief that a settlement will preserve 450 jobs.”

USDA: Don’t add foodborne illness to summer menu,https://www.masslive.com,"['Anne-Gerard Flynn', 'Special To The Republican']",05-21-2019,2019,5,https://www.masslive.com/news/2019/05/usda-dont-add-foodborne-illness-to-summer-menu.html,"Rates of foodborne illnesses increase during the summer.

According to the Food Safety and Inspection Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the season’s hot and humid weather causes environmental bacteria to grow faster and, of course, food is more exposed to possible contamination with summer’s many outdoor activities.

“We receive thousands of different questions from consumers regarding food safety during the summer,"" said Adam Ghering of FSIS’ Office of Public Affairs and Consumer Education.

“Many of those questions are linked to the weather. Severe storms and power outages routinely impact food safety during the summer.”

He added, “In general, perishable foods will stay safe in a refrigerator for four hours when the door remains closed.”

“If the power is out for longer, you can transfer foods to a cooler with ice or frozen gel packs. Foods in the freezer will be safe for approximately 48 hours, 24 hours if the fridge is half full,” said Ghering, adding further information on what food is still considered save to consume after a power outage is available online or by calling the USDA’s Meat and Poultry Hotline at 1-888-674-6854.

Ghering said that the “other topic that we receive many questions about is cooking outdoors.”

“Cooking away from the kitchen can be fun but it also requires a good deal of preparation to ensure everything goes smoothly,” he said.

“Bringing water for washing hands, utensils and other equipment is something that can be easily overlooked. Moist towelettes can be a good ‘touch-up’ when your hands get dirty but the most effective method is soap and water.”

He also recommended a cooler will “to keep your food cold, just remember to keep replenishing ice as it melts” and “any type of food thermometer will provide you with the internal temperature of your meat and thereby help you prevent foodborne illness.”

“Any type of improper handling of your food can cause illness but not properly cooking and cooling meat and poultry is vital during summer months,” Ghering said.

“Meat and poultry can quickly brown when grilled but that doesn’t mean they are safe to eat.”

He called probe food thermometers “which you can keep in meat and poultry while cooking” a “great addition to your grilling equipment” in particular.

USDA tips to avoid food poisoning that is estimated to cause some 128,000 hospitalizations and 3,000 deaths in the United States annually include:

Perishable food should not sit out for more than two hours at room temperature and no more than an hour when the temperature is above 90 degrees.

Pack beverages in one cooler and perishable food in another cooler and place cooler in shade when possible, even in car.

If grilling away from home, bring your own water for preparation and cleaning if unsure of availability of clean water supply.

Use a meat thermometer to ensure harmful bacteria are destroyed. Cook beef, pork, lamb and veal to internal minimum safe temperatures of 145 degrees; ground meats, 160 degrees; whole poultry, poultry breasts and ground poultry, 165 degrees.

Keep cooked meats at 140 degrees or warmer by setting them to the side of the grill rack, not directly over the coals where they could overcook. They may also be kept hot in an oven set at approximately 200 degrees in a chafing dish, slow cooker or warming tray.

Leftovers should be stored within two hours of cooking. Divide them into smaller portions and refrigerate or freeze in covered shallow containers for quicker cooling."

Market participants are likely to closely monitor a flurry of speeches from policymakers at the U.S. central bank. Fed Chair Jerome Powell, Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker and Vice Chair Richard Clarida are all set to comment on the world's largest economy at separate events on Monday.

The Fed earlier this month said that it would keep interest rates unchanged, though Powell added that officials saw a decline in inflation in the first quarter as simply ""transcient""

""We think our policy stance is appropriate at the moment and we don't see a strong case for moving in either direction,"" Powell said on May 1. ""We say in our statement of longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy that the Committee would be concerned if inflation were running persistently above or below 2%.""

""And in this case, as we look at these readings in the first quarter for core, we do see good reasons to think that some were or all of the unexpected decrease may wind up being transient,"" he added."

Sprint Corp. and T-Mobile are seeking permission to merge. (Jeenah Moon/Photographer: /Bloomberg)

A merger between T-Mobile and Sprint, the nation’s third- and fourth-largest wireless carriers, entered uncertain legal territory this week, after the two federal agencies reviewing the $26 billion deal appeared to split in their thinking about the transaction.

The two companies’ plans received early blessings on Monday from Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai, who said the telecom tie-up would benefit consumers by speeding up the nationwide deployment of new, ultrafast mobile broadband service. The FCC’s two other Republicans backed the merger, too, positioning it to win the FCC’s final approval in the coming weeks.

But the other agency reviewing the deal — the Justice Department — still appears to harbor reservations about the combination of T-Mobile and Sprint, according to a person familiar with the Justice Department’s investigation into the proposed merger.

Officials in the antitrust division, led by Makan Delrahim, remain skeptical that allowing the number of top wireless carriers to drop from four to three will help consumers, who now benefit from the pressure these rivals exert on each other to improve their prices and service offerings, the person said. The source asked not to be identified because the proceedings are private.

A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment on the investigation. But Jeremy Edwards, a spokesman at the agency, noted that the Justice Department “has a different statutory mandate than the FCC.”

Even if the FCC approves the merger, the Justice Department still could try to block the deal in court on grounds it threatens competition. Sprint and T-Mobile declined to comment.

In his comments, Pai stressed that the deal would benefit consumers. “Two of the FCC’s top priorities are closing the digital divide in rural America and advancing United States leadership in 5G, the next generation of wireless connectivity,"" he said in a statement. “The commitments made today by T-Mobile and Sprint would substantially advance each of these critical objectives.”

[T-Mobile executives seeking merger approval booked more than 52 nights at Trump’s D.C. hotel]

Federal regulators began considering the merger between T-Mobile, operated by Germany’s Deutsche Telekom, and Sprint, run by the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank, after the companies announced their plans in April 2018. For years, the wireless giants had flirted with such a combination, but political head winds — including threats from Washington that it would block such a deal — forced them to consistently abandon their plans.

This time, executives at Sprint and T-Mobile say a merger would be the only way for them to challenge the massive corporate footprints of their larger rivals, AT&T and Verizon, at a moment when those wireless giants are preparing to deploy the next generation of mobile service. But critics, including public-interest advocates and even some telecom rivals, have blasted the deal, arguing it would further consolidate an industry that lacks choices and result in high prices for consumers.

Joining them in opposition are prominent congressional Democrats and 2020 presidential contenders, such as Sens. Cory Booker (N.J.), Amy Klobuchar (Minn.) and Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), who together sounded off against the deal in a letter to regulators earlier this year.

In an attempt to ameliorate critics, Sprint and T-Mobile announced on Monday a series of concessions. They include a commitment to build out 5G wireless to 97 percent of the country in three years, including much of rural America, while offering “same or better rate plans at the same or better prices” for the next three years. They also pledged to divest Sprint’s prepaid phone business, called Boost Mobile, to a third party following the deal’s approval.

“The New T-Mobile will be a disruptive rival with the resources to go toe-to-toe with established behemoths to drive competition and innovation that benefits everyone, everywhere,” T-Mobile CEO John Legere wrote in a blog post.

Those commitments helped the deal win Republicans at the FCC. Along with Pai, Republican Commissioner Brendan Carr said the tie-up as proposed would “help close the digital divide.” Fellow GOP Commissioner Michael O’Rielly, for his part, said he is “inclined to support the T-Mobile/Sprint proposed merger,” noting that its concessions may not be necessary.

Pai, the agency’s chairman, warned that the companies would face “suffer serious consequences” if they broke their promises, including “payments to the U.S. Treasury of billions of dollars.” But Democratic Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel appeared unconvinced, tweeting Monday she has “serious doubts” about further consolidation in the wireless industry.

[Merger of Sprint and T-Mobile would take a bite out of wireless workers' paychecks]

Experts said this week they could not remember a time when the FCC gave a telecom merger a green light, yet Justice sought to block it in court. But the department’s top antitrust officials have not shied away from challenging other instances of industry consolidation in recent months: Delrahim last year sought to block AT&T from buying the content giant Time Warner, though the Department of Justice ultimately lost the case and the companies completed the deal. Bloomberg first reported details of the agency’s doubts about the combination of Sprint and T-Mobile.

“For Justice, [going from] four to three is this massive problem,” said Andrew Jay Schwartzman, a top lawyer at the Communications and Technology Law Clinic at Georgetown’s Institute for Public Representation.

The FCC can look at the deal and say ""look at this race to 5G,"" he said. ""That doesn't matter to the Department of Justice. They're looking at competition. Broadband deployment reaching a high percentage of the country is not a competition issue.""

If the government does opt to challenge Sprint and T-Mobile in court, the DOJ may find itself warring against the FCC. A judge must decide “how much weight is put on what appears to be the majority of the FCC’s opinion, which is clearly not based on competition policy,” said Gene Kimmelman, a former DOJ antitrust official and president of Public Knowledge. The Washington-based consumer group has opposed the merger.

Analysts said the Justice Department’s skepticism could also fuel a challenge led by state attorneys general. Even if the DOJ doesn’t ultimately sue, the odds are growing that “state attorneys general for the blue states will sue in Federal court to try to block the transaction,” warned Craig Moffett, a senior analyst at the firm MoffettNathanson, in a note to investors this week.

“The deal looks like it has crossed one important hurdle (the FCC),"" he wrote. “But that was neither the highest nor the most important hurdle.”"
Five missteps that led to the removal of St. Petersburg Housing Authority board members,https://www.tampabay.com,[],05-21-2019,2019,5,https://www.tampabay.com/florida/2019/05/21/five-missteps-that-led-to-the-removal-of-st-petersburg-housing-authority-board-members/,"City Hall veterans can’t remember officials ever removing a St. Petersburg Housing Authority board member from office. Now Mayor Rick Kriseman has replaced five of the seven-member voluntary board in just the past three months including three who were removed from office Thursday. Here’s a look at the missteps that have dogged the agency over the past year:

1. Relocation of residents from Jordan Park

The bungalows of Jordan Park sit empty behind a gate put up to enclose the properties.

The Housing Authority’s plan to demolish rather than renovate the last original structures of the historic African-American community was controversial enough. Then it relocated about 31 families from the complex even though there was no financing in place to redevelop it. Displaced residents complained they had been moved into deplorable housing, leading prominent community leaders including School Board Chairwoman Renee Flowers and City Council member Lisa Wheeler-Bowman to call for new board members that would challenge agency CEO Tony Love.





2. Charging its own board member for public records

St. Petersburg Housing Authority board member Terri Lipsey Scott received an email from the agency she oversees stating she must pay up to $400 for records she wants to review. The agency said her list of 14 different requests would take considerable staff time to produce. Other Tampa Bay housing authorities say they provide board members any records free of charge. CHRIS URSO | Times

Housing Authority board members, who are charged with overseeing the agency, serve on a voluntary basis. So Terri Lipsey Scott was outraged when she was told in January she would have to pay as much as $400 for agency records including minutes of meetings, staff evaluations of Love, and travel and legal invoices. By the time St. Petersburg City Council Chairman Charlie Gerdes decided he would intervene and pay for the records, the cost had risen to $900. The agency eventually returned Gerdes’ check and provided Scott the records for free.





3. Allowing CEO Tony Love to live for nine months in low-income housing

St. Petersburg Housing Authority CEO Tony Love lived in a second-floor unit at Saratoga Apartments for nine months in 2016. The agency was originally required to pay his rent for six months as part of his relocation package. It also paid for $3,000 in furniture and his monthly electric bills.

When it hired Love in 2016, the Housing Authority agreed to pay his rent for six months as part of a relocation package. Love, instead, decided it made more sense for him to live in a vacant agency apartment than for the Housing Authority to pay for a privately owned one. He moved into a complex restricted to low-income families. Love, who at the time was earning $140,000, also billed the agency $3,000 to furnish the apartment and $625 for his electric bills, items that were not listed in his relocation benefits. The perk didn’t end after six months. Board members retroactively agreed to extend his stay for an extra three months. A Tampa Bay Times report exposing the misuse of agency resources led to the agency being cited by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development in March.





4. Failing to disclose complaints about the CEO to board members voting on his $10,000 pay raise

St. Petersburg Housing Authority CEO Tony Love was awarded a $10,000 raise in 2017. Some board members said they were never shown his evaluation but voted for the raise nonetheless.

Love’s first evaluation as agency CEO was conducted in 2017 by the agency’s personnel committee, which included board members Harry Harvey and Delphinia Davis. It included questionnaires filled in by about eight senior agency staffers about their boss. At least two of employees described a leader who bullied and belittled his workers and ordered some to work on preparations for his fraternity’s golf event. The complaints were serious enough for the agency to pay $3,600 for a consultant to work with Love on his people skills. But none of those reports nor the consultant’s report were forwarded to other board members who were asked later that year to approve raising Love’s yearly salary to $150,000. Board members approved the hike even though some questioned how they could vote on an evaluation they hadn’t seen.





5. Board members held emergency meeting in violation of Florida’s “Government in the Sunshine” act

With Kriseman’s pledge to remove three board members hanging over them, Board Chairman Harvey scheduled an emergency meeting April 10 for the board to authorize taking legal action against the city. Ironically, the meeting ended up making its way into the “charges” the city used to justify removing Harvey and Ann Sherman White from office.

The only public notice of the meeting was made to board members via an email sent by Love at 7:14 p.m. the night before it took place. State law says “reasonable notice” must be made to the public before such meetings are held, and that they must be open to the public. The meeting was attended by only three board members, too few to establish a quorum required by state law for board action. Nonetheless, the board voted to authorize suing the city. Concern about the legality of the action led agency attorney Charley Harris to recommend the board redo the vote at its next regular board meeting."
Homeland Security warns of scam that uses real law enforcement numbers,https://kstp.com,[],,,,https://kstp.com/news/homeland-security-warns-scam-uses-real-law-enforcement-phone-numbers-dhs/5361377/,"According to the release, the perpetrator starts by befriending victims on a mobile app for chatting, such as Facebook Messenger or Words with Friends, and feigns romantic interest in the victim through dating services or chat rooms. After gaining the victim's trust, the perpetrator describes a minor hardship and persuades the victim to sent them a small amount of money.

The release says a fraudster then calls the victim the following day, claiming to be an employee of DHS or another law enforcement agency. DHS says the fraudsters spoof the caller ID of legitimate law enforcement phone numbers, and tells the victim the funds they sent the day before went to a criminal organization or terrorist group, such as ISIS or Al-Qaeda, and threatens them with arrest and imprisonment.

The fraudsters then direct the victim to contact a ""lawyer"" who can help them, and the ""lawyer"" then instructs the victim to pay $1,000 or more as a ""retainer.""

DHS says the Office of Inspector General is investigating the situation, but reminds the public that law enforcement and other government agency phone numbers may be used by the fraudsters in the scam. The release warns people to not provide any personal information when receiving calls from these numbers.

The release says people should remember that legitimate law enforcement callers will never ask you to pay fines over the phone or request money from you. If you question the validity of the call, you're urged to call the relevant field office number of the agency that called and ask to be put in touch with the individual who called you.

If you believe you may have been a victim of this scam, DHS urges you to call its hotline at 1-800-323-8603 or file a complaint online at oig.dhs.gov."

Two organizations representing farmers and fishermen announced their support for legislation that would require the U.S. Department of Agriculture purchase agricultural commodities and seafood from domestically owned enterprises whenever possible.

Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., introduced this past week a bill in the U.S. House of Representatives on Tuesday called the “Buy American Agriculture Act.”

In addition to requiring the secretary of the USDA to purchase from domestically owned enterprises, the legislation would require the secretary to publish why the purchasing contracts were awarded to enterprises and whether they are domestically owned.

DeLauro announced she would file the bill in January, when the USDA published reports it would purchase nearly 9.8 million pounds of pork for $22.3 million from Greeley-based JBS USA through a program meant to help U.S. farmers impacted by the trade war. However, JBS USA is a subsidiary of JBS SA, an international meatpacker based out of Brazil.

According to reports from the Department of Agriculture, JBS USA has since secured nine additional contracts for nearly 18.5 million pounds of pork for $40.1 million.

“This legislation comes at a time when USDA, in the name of bailing out farmers harmed by the U.S.-China trade war, has already awarded over $60 million of U.S. taxpayer funds to one of the largest and most corrupt meatpacking corporations in the world,” the Organization for Competitive Markets stated in a news release.

In its release, the organization provided the following reasons for supporting the legislation:

In November 2018, Chinese-owned Smithfield Foods rescinded its bid for $240,000 through the trade mitigation program after backlash on Capitol Hill,

JBS SA was involved in a corruption scandal involving more than 1,800 Brazilian politicians,

In 2017, the company exported rotten meat worldwide, using cancerous acid products to cover up the stench,

This past year, the company recalled about 12 million pounds of ground beef

The USDA settled claims in 2018 that JBS shorted three separate slaughter facilities on payments for their cattle. The company paid a $50,000 penalty.

“At a time when our farmers and fishermen are barely surviving and multinational companies dominate our food system, this is a particularly important measure,” the Northwest Atlantic Marine Alliance stated in the release.

JBS USA defended the USDA purchases in a January statement to The Tribune:

“As an approved vendor in USDA food purchasing programs, all eligible JBS USA pork products come from American livestock raised on American farms by U.S. family farmers, and are processed in American facilities in rural American towns.”"
New DOJ Investigation Has Haunted FBI for Months,https://www.realclearpolitics.com,[],05-18-2019,2019,5,https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2019/05/18/new_doj_investigation_has_haunted_fbi_for_months.html,"John Durham, the prosecutor tapped by Attorney General William Barr to investigate how Trump-Russia allegations emerged and spread within federal law enforcement, has already been looking into whether the FBI’s former top lawyer, James Baker, illegally leaked to reporters.

In fact, the U.S. attorney from Connecticut appears to have begun that work more than seven months ago, to judge from an underreported transcript of an October congressional interview with Baker. The Baker interview, at which Durham was not present, suggests that the prosecutor nevertheless has some people very worried.

Baker testified about the Trump-Russia affair on Oct. 3 before the House Judiciary Committee and the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform.

In that session, the former FBI general counsel admitted that versions and variations of Christopher Steele’s dossier were being turned in to the bureau from the strangest of places. Baker said he had even heard about it from David Corn, Washington bureau chief of left-leaning Mother Jones, who wrote one of the first pieces on the dossier, in October 2016. But in one of those company-town connections that happen frequently in Washington, Baker said he was not just a contact or source for Corn; they were also old pals.

“Tell me about your relationship with David Corn,” said Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan.

“David is a friend of mine,” Baker said.

“Tell me about that. A close friend? Long-time friend?”

“Long-time friend.”

Jordan asked, “When did you first meet Mr. Corn?”

“I don't specifically remember,” Baker testified. “A long time ago, though.”

“Years ago? “

“Years and years and years ago, yeah,” Baker allowed. “Our kids carpooled together. We carpooled with them when our kids were little.”

So one of the most divisive scandals in Washington history was facilitated by an unexpected friendship, an odd couple brought together by a shared interest in getting their kids dropped off at school.

The congressman from Ohio wanted to know more about the Baker-Corn relationship: “Prior to the election of – Presidential election of 2016,” Jordan asked, “how many times did you talk with David Corn in the weeks and months prior to election day?”

“I don't remember,” Baker said, providing an answer that suggests it was more than a few.

“Is it fair to say you did” talk with Corn, Jordan asked?

“Yes, I did, but I just don't remember how many [times].”

“So did you talk to Mr. Corn about anything that the FBI was working on,” Jordan asked, “specifically the now infamous Steele dossier?”

Suddenly, Baker’s lawyer, Dan Levin, jumped in: “One second,” he said before he and his client had a conversation off the record.

When the microphones were back on, Levin declared he would “not let [Baker] answer these questions right now. You may or may not know, he's been the subject of a leak investigation which is still – a criminal leak investigation that's still active at the Justice Department.” And so Levin concluded, “I’m sorry. I'm cutting off any discussion about conversations with reporters.”

North Carolina Rep. Mark Meadows wanted to make clear what Baker’s lawyer was claiming: “You're saying he's under criminal investigation? That's why you're not letting him answer?”

“Yes.”

Levin and the lawmakers sparred a bit over whether Baker was invoking his Fifth Amendment rights, and the congressmen finally got around to asking who was leading this criminal probe:

“There is an ongoing investigation by whom?” Jordan said.

“The Justice Department,” Levin responded.

“I mean, is the inspector general looking at this or is this—”

“No,” said Levin, “it's Mr. John Durham, a prosecutor.”

The specter of Durham haunts the rest of the interview. Baker can’t talk about what he told his old friend David Corn in their conversations about the dossier because it would put Baker in legal jeopardy.

Time and again, when Baker was asked questions about reporters – even hypothetical questions about FBI policy regarding contacts with the press, Levin said, “I'm not going to allow him to answer that question” or “I am not going let him answer any questions about leaks.”

“I don't want him talking about conversations he's had with reporters because I don't know what the questions are and I don't know what the answers are right now,” Levin said. “Given that there is an ongoing investigation of him for leaks which the Department has not closed, I'm not comfortable letting him answer questions.” Durham’s inquiry was serious enough to limit significantly what Baker was willing to talk about with lawmakers.

That Baker’s lawyer advised him not to talk about leaks is, of course, not proof that Baker leaked. ""Baker's lawyer was obviously being prudent and saying his client could not talk about anything related to any leaks of any kind,"" David Corn tells RealClearInvestigations. Corn emphasizes that the ""Durham inquiry did not involve Russia or the Steele memos; it had nothing to do with me or my limited interaction with Baker.""

And one former federal official who said he has been interviewed by Durham in connection with the Baker probe, Robert Litt, has written that the inquiry has nothing to do with the Steele dossier.

Contacted by RealClearInvestigations, Levin said, “Mr. Baker did not make an unauthorized disclosure of classified information and we are confident the investigation will conclude that.”

"As Trade War Hits, China Looks Unsteady as $1.1 Trillion Treasury Investor",https://www.thestreet.com,['Bradley Keoun'],05-21-2019,2019,5,https://www.thestreet.com/markets/as-trade-war-hits-china-looks-unsteady-as-trillion-dollar-treasury-bond-investor-14965285,"As President Donald Trump escalates his administration's trade war against China, a growing number of investors worry that the Asian country might fight back by liquidating its biggest-in-the-world stash of U.S. Treasury bonds.

Such a move is seen by most observers as unlikely. For China, it would be the economic version of the nuclear option.

But a new report suggested that China's central bank might have to start selling down its $1.12 trillion of Treasuries anyway -- to meet growing demand for the American currency from Chinese importers and tourists.

China has been one of the biggest buyers of Treasuries since it won entry into the World Trade Organization in 2001, so a shift to draw-down mode could reduce global demand for the U.S. government bonds -- putting downward pressure on prices for the securities, and consequently pushing up yields.

It couldn't come at a worse time for the Trump administration, which is confronting China over allegedly unfair trade practices even as the U.S. Treasury Department needs international investors to help finance U.S. government budget deficits, currently pushing $1 trillion a year.

""As China stops being a large buyer of U.S. Treasuries, America's budget deficit is ballooning,"" according to the report from Dubai-based deVere Group, a $12 billion wealth-management firm. ""The combination is negative for U.S. Treasuries.""

Yields on 10-year Treasuries could jump to 2.8% by the end of 2019 from about 2.4% currently, said Tom Elliott, deVere's London-based chief international strategist. And even that level would still be low by historical standards, at roughly half the 30-year average. Last October, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon predicted that Treasury yields could jump to 4% or higher.

The Treasury market is critical because it's the U.S. government's primary means of financing the $22 trillion-and-growing national debt. Treasuries are a staple in most investors' portfolios, and they're a core asset of U.S. banks, since the bonds theoretically could be liquidated to free up cash if depositors suddenly demanded their money back.

China's massive trade surplus over the past two decades has allowed the nation to build up roughly $3 trillion of foreign reserves, including the U.S. Treasury bonds.

But that surplus is shrinking now, partly driven by a big increase in the nation's imports from Japan and South Korea as well as a surge in domestic consumption.

More Chinese tourists are going abroad, and they need to exchange their yuan for dollars. As of 2017, for example, the London department store Harrod's was reportedly taking in more sales from Chinese tourists than from British nationals.

A selldown by China of its Treasuries could open a new front in its ongoing trade war with the Trump administration, increasingly seen as a historic standoff among the world's two biggest economic superpowers.

""Some kind of trade conflict was present rather consistently throughout the history of conflict between ruling powers and rising powers,"" according to a Bank of America analysis published Monday.

Higher Treasury yields would likely exacerbate U.S. federal budget deficits, since payments would rise on the national debt.

And given the dollar's role as the world's dominant reserve currency, interest rates would likely also increase in other countries.

""Investors around the world may see higher global borrowing rates, from car loans to mortgages, because of the end of the Chinese savings glut,"" Elliott wrote. ""This could trigger a global economic downturn,"" Elliott wrote."

This legislation could help more small tech companies land defense contracts,https://www.fedscoop.com,['Dave Nyczepir'],05-20-2019,2019,5,https://www.fedscoop.com/sbir-dod-legislation-mac-thornberry/,"Written by Dave Nyczepir

Newly proposed legislation could increase the amount of work the Department of Defense does with small businesses — particularly those that get a majority of their funding from venture capital.

The Accelerating Defense Innovation Act would create a pilot project within the DOD’s Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program to direct grant money to companies the department has otherwise avoided because of legal hurdles that stretch back more than a decade.

Created in 1983, SBIR provides small businesses with research grants to expedite their products’ development, as well as potential follow-on funding and assistance in meeting competitive requirements during the acquisition process. In 2003, courts ruled companies with more than 50 percent venture capital ownership are ineligible for SBIR grants. Congress created a waiver in 2011 for small businesses that are majority owned by multiple domestic venture investors, which requires congressional notification and Small Business Administration approval.

DOD has never used the waiver. Instead, the department “is turning away innovative small businesses with the most promising military and commercial technologies,” reads a fact sheet from the office of Rep. Mac Thornberry, R-Texas, the new bill’s sponsor. For example, Thornberry’s office cites satellite technology from startup Capella Space that can see through clouds. The 50-person team came out of DOD’s Hacking 4 Defense program but failed to receive an SBIR grant because of venture capital investment.

The Domestic Investment Pilot Program would allow the secretary of Defense and service acquisition executives for each military department to make an SBIR award to a small business that is majority-owned by multiple domestic venture investors. The bill allows no more than 15 percent of DOD SBIR program funds to be awarded to small businesses owned in majority part by multiple domestic venture investors, and the program will end on Sept. 30, 2022.

Despite the limitations of SBIR, there are other ways for young tech companies to work with the DOD, regardless of their funding. The Defense Innovation Unit, for example, currently handles pilot projects for commercial innovations that any of the department’s branches may procure after testing is complete. The goal is to speed up time to agreement, which the unit generally reaches within 90 days of first contact with the company.

Thornberry, the ranking Republican on the House Armed Services Committee, wants to include his legislation in the 2020 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), the release said."
Critics Say USDA Plan To Move Federal Agencies Could Hurt Research Vital For Farmers,https://www.npr.org,['Frank Morris'],05-18-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/18/724433714/critics-say-usda-plan-to-move-federal-agencies-could-hurt-research-vital-for-far,"Critics Say USDA Plan To Move Federal Agencies Could Hurt Research Vital For Farmers

A couple of federal agencies you probably haven't heard of keep track of what farmers grow, what Americans eat and how the country's entire food system operates. And the Trump administration wants them out of Washington, D.C.

Last summer, Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue announced the Economic Research Service (ERS) and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) would relocate somewhere that's closer to farmers and public universities doing agricultural research. But critics, including many scientists, balked, saying the agencies won't be as effective.

ERS collects and crunches numbers on everything from how much corn syrup Americans consume to how tariffs affect farmers, while NIFA funds research that does things like closely track climate change.

USDA has yet to announce a new home for the agencies, but recently narrowed the list to three: the greater Kansas City metro area, the Research Triangle Park area near Raleigh, N.C., and various sites in Indiana — Vice President Mike Pence's home state.

Kansas Sen. Jerry Moran recalled when he heard of Perdue's proposal.

""My first thought was Kansas City would be the perfect place,"" said the Republican, who, along with other Missouri and Kansas members of Congress, supports the move.

""Not every job in government needs to be in Washington D.C."" Moran said, noting that about 9 out of 10 USDA employees already work outside of Washington.

He added that ERS and NIFA would boost budding research clusters like the Kansas City area's animal health corridor and give bright kids from the region a chance to stay put and still pursue a research career. The move would also fall in line with the Trump administration's cost-cutting measures. Moran said office rent and the cost of living is cheaper away from the coasts.

Skepticism about what is driving the move

But many in the research community said efficiency isn't driving the move. It's hostility toward science.

""I think that moving the agencies out of D.C. is going to significantly dilute their effectiveness as well as their relevance,"" says Ricardo Salvador, who is the Director of the Food and Environment Program at the Union of Concerned Scientists.

The agency's effectiveness already is under attack, according to a former ERS employee who was granted anonymity due to fear of losing his current position.

""Efforts by the secretary ... have just destroyed morale,"" the ex-ERS employee said.

He said he enjoyed working at the agency until about a year and a half ago, when researchers began to fear tackling politically sensitive topics. Then, Purdue pushed to take the agency out from under nonpartisan oversight and place it under his control.

Finally, the ex-employee said, the surprise announcement to move most of ERS and NIFA out of Washington triggered a cascade of resignations, including his own.

""I think it's had its intended effect. People have left, morale is low. The agency will take a long time to recover from the damage that's been inflicted,"" the former employee said.

Employees remaining at ERS and NIFA are fighting back. ERS researchers recently voted to join the American Federation of Government Employees, and NIFA employees plan to take a vote, too. The union will negotiate to give ERS and NIFA employees longer to decide if they want to move, and is backing legislation that would withhold funds USDA would need to make the move.

The Trump administration wanted staff reductions years ago. And all three Trump budgets, none of which have been accepted by Congress, have proposed deep cuts to the agencies.

Salvador argued that's because objective research often clashes with political ideology. ERS studies, for instance, concluded that the 2017 tax cuts championed by the administration would most benefit the richest farmers, and that the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which Trump wants to cut, is good for the economy.

""So the secretary is clearly dealing with inconvenient facts by going to the source and eliminating them,"" Salvador said.

Sen. Jerry Moran said he believes the research agencies can be relocated and well supported, and he's played a key role in fighting off earlier efforts to cut funding for agricultural research.

Moran said farmers, ranchers and policymakers can't make sound decisions without reliable USDA data.

But that's exactly the problem critics have with the proposal to move ERS and NIFA: They say the USDA hasn't produced data that support the move."

"Acting DHS chief says U.S. won't send migrants to Florida, insists he didn't threaten to quit",https://www.cbsnews.com,['Kathryn Watson'],,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/kevin-mcaleenan-acting-dhs-chief-tells-face-the-nation-the-trump-administration-wont-send-migrants-to-florida/,"The Trump administration will not send immigrants who cross the southern border to Florida, a reversal that was decided over the weekend, acting Department of Homeland Security chief Kevin McAleenan told ""Face the Nation"" on Sunday.

McAleenan's comments come after Florida officials said they were told earlier last week that federal officials were sending immigrants to South Florida jurisdictions. McAleenan told ""Face the Nation"" that ""U.S. Customs and Border Protection did notify officials locally in those areas that they were looking at the possibility of doing that,"" but the CBP acting commissioner decided against doing so Saturday.

News of the plans drew criticism from elected officials in Florida, including Ron DeSantis, the state's Republican governor, who said Friday the state ""cannot accommodate in Florida this dumping of unlawful migrants."" DeSantis confirmed in a Tweet Sunday that he has spoken with Mr. Trump, and migrants won't be heading to his state.

""President @realDonaldTrump and I spoke yesterday and confirmed that he did not approve, nor would approve, sending immigrants who illegally cross the border, to Florida. It is not going to happen,"" DeSantis tweeted.

McAleenan insisted the administration is focused on using southwest border areas to handle the influx of immigrants. He also claimed the administration isn't moving immigrants to sanctuary jurisdictions, as President Trump has said he wants to do. McAleenan claimed sanctuary cities are already housing many immigrants because those cities serve as a ""magnet.""

McAleenan also insisted he never threatened to quit, denying a Washington Post report that he threatened to leave amid a dispute with top Trump adviser and immigration hardliner Stephen Miller, who was reportedly pushing for another shakeup at the agency.

McAleenan, who is also the head of CBP, took over as acting DHS secretary after former DHS secretary Kirstjen Nielsen resigned in April.

Last week, Mr. Trump announced a proposal to reform legal immigration by restricting some family-based migration and instituting higher skill and education requirements. The proposal would overhaul the family-based migration system Mr. Trump calls ""chain migration."" But the proposal was light on specifics, and the administration has given no timeline for when the proposal might be released in the form of a bill.

""Our proposal is pro-American, pro-immigrant, and pro-worker. It's just common sense,"" the president told supporters and reporters in the White House Rose Garden on Thursday."
CFPB Chief Says Education Department Is Blocking Student Loan Oversight,https://www.npr.org,['Chris Arnold'],05-16-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/16/723568597/cfpb-chief-says-education-department-is-blocking-student-loan-oversight,"CFPB Chief Says Education Department Is Blocking Student Loan Oversight

The director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau says the Trump administration's Education Department is getting in the way of efforts to police the student loan industry. The revelation, in a letter obtained by NPR, comes at the same time that lawsuits allege that widespread wrongdoing by student loan companies is costing some borrowers thousands of dollars.

CFPB Director Kathy Kraninger explained the problem in an April letter responding to questions from Sen. Elizabeth Warren and other lawmakers about whether the federal regulator had ""abandoned its supervision and enforcement activities"" related to more than $1 trillion in student loans.

A central issue is that companies that manage student loans, known as student loan servicers, are refusing to share information that the CFPB says it needs to perform proper oversight.

""Since December 2017,"" Kraninger wrote in the letter, ""student loan servicers have declined to produce information requested by the Bureau for supervisory examinations"" related to federal student loans.

She said servicers are not sharing the information because the Department of Education has issued guidance telling them not to do so, citing ""privacy"" concerns. Kraninger also said that information from student loan servicers is ""necessary for supervisory examinations.""

The letter is a carefully worded response to senators' questions. But Kraninger, a Trump administration appointee, is in essence saying that the CFPB is trying to do its job protecting student borrowers and supervising loan servicing companies, but the Education Department is getting in the way.

""It's actually quite remarkable,"" says Seth Frotman, executive director of the nonprofit Student Borrower Protection Center. ""The head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is telling the world that the secretary of education has put in place a series of policies that are obstructing federal law enforcement officials from standing up for the millions of Americans with student debt.""

Frotman used to be the CFPB's student loan ombudsman but quit last summer over frustrations with the Trump administration. In a scathing resignation letter last August, he said the Trump administration was ""turning its back on student borrowers"" and preventing him from doing his job.

Now Kraninger, the administration's hand-picked director for the bureau, is pointing the finger, albeit in a less dramatic way, at the Education Department for hindering efforts to protect student borrowers.

In response to Kraninger's letter, Elizabeth Warren, Sherrod Brown, and three other Democratic senators called the revelations ""disturbing"" in a round of letters they fired off this week to loan servicing companies.

The lawmakers say in their letters that since Kraninger says the CFPB has attempted to get documents it needs for supervision and been rebuffed by the servicers, that ""reveals that the Department under Secretary DeVos, has removed the most potent weapon from the CFPB's arsenal to fight illegal behavior and mistreatment of borrowers by student loan servicers, and that federal student loan servicers, who are paid by the federal government, are ignoring federal regulators' requests for information.""

The senators' letters add that no ""guidance"" from the Department of Education ""can absolve servicers of their legal responsibility to comply with state and federal consumer protection law.""

Student borrowers getting hurt

When Jessica Saint-Paul heard about a program called Public Service Loan Forgiveness, she was ecstatic. For borrowers who work in qualifying public service jobs — such as police officers, government workers, people who work at nonprofit organizations — the program promises that if they make loan payments for 10 years, the remainder of their student debt will be forgiven. Saint-Paul had about $80,000 in student loans and she wasn't making much money working for a nonprofit that provides services to foster children.

""I was just like, 'Oh, this is perfect,' "" Saint-Paul says. So she called the company that was servicing her student loans and says she was told she was all set — after 10 years, she should be eligible to get her loans forgiven. That was nine years ago.

Saint-Paul said she called back over the years, including once when she changed nonprofit jobs in 2014, to say, ""just making sure I'm on track."" She says she was told, "" 'OK, no problem.' The conversation was quick; they were so kind.""

The call center workers might have been friendly, but Saint-Paul says she was getting bad information. She says she found that out just last year at a conference she attended. There was an information session on loan forgiveness, and she was told she was in the wrong kind of loan and wrong payment plan so she couldn't qualify. She says many other people were finding out the same thing alongside her at the conference.

""It was like a support group almost it turned into because people were like, 'No, that can't be true,' "" Saint-Paul says. ""I went on my phone, people were on their laptops checking what kind of loan they were in. We were all sitting there just frantic.""

Saint-Paul says that if nine years ago her loan servicer had just told her to convert to the right loan and payment plan, everything would have been OK. Instead, she says she feels as though someone stole tens of thousands of dollars from her.

""I just cannot believe this happened to me,"" she says. ""That's like criminal, it's not right.""

Many people agree that it's not right — regulators and advocacy groups are filing a growing number of lawsuits against loan servicing companies alleging mishandling of the loan forgiveness program. Saint-Paul is a plaintiff in one of them.

Many of the consumer complaints and lawsuits involve allegations that servicing companies gave borrowers bad information or advice that resulted in them thinking they were getting credit toward loan forgiveness, when in fact they were in the wrong loan or payment plan.

The Education Department revealed late last year that about 99% of borrowers who thought they had reached that 10-year milestone and applied for forgiveness were rejected. More than 1 million people are actively pursuing loan forgiveness under the program and hoping to qualify.

That's why Democratic lawmakers say they want to make sure that perhaps the most powerful watchdog — the CFPB — is on top of all this.

Fears that the watchdog has been asleep

Since 2011, the CFPB has monitored loan servicers, lenders and complaints from student borrowers and brought enforcement actions when it discovered wrongdoing. For example, the CFPB in 2015 returned $480 million to allegedly defrauded students of Corinthian Colleges.

In 2017, the CFPB brought a lawsuit against one of the nation's largest student loan servicers, Navient. The bureau said Navient ""created obstacles to repayment by providing bad information, processing payments incorrectly, and failing to act when borrowers complained. Through shortcuts and deception, the company also illegally cheated many struggling borrowers out of their rights to lower repayments, which caused them to pay much more than they had to for their loans."" That lawsuit is ongoing.

Navient disputes the allegations in the CFPB lawsuit and other suits brought by state regulators. ""The allegations made in the claims are unfounded, and we are vigorously defending our record in court,"" a Navient spokesman says.

But since Richard Cordray, the bureau's Obama-era director, stepped down in November 2017, consumer advocates have been worried that the Trump-appointed interim director, Mick Mulvaney, and now the permanent director, Kraninger, have backed away from protecting student borrowers.

But in her letter, Kraninger said the consumer protection bureau takes that job seriously.

""As with all industries subject to the Bureau's supervisory or enforcement authority, the Bureau will continue to monitor those subject to its authority — in this case, student lenders and student loan servicers — to ensure they are complying with the law,"" she wrote.

At the same time, Kraninger also explained that the Education Department has created obstacles that are getting in the way of the CFPB doing its job. In addition to the guidance to student loan servicers that is impeding oversight efforts, back in 2017, the Trump administration's Education Department ended information sharing agreements that it had with the CFPB. In her letter, Kraninger said an information-sharing agreement (called a Memorandum of Understanding) is required under law and it is ""a priority"" for the bureau to get a new one in place.

Some advocates say the CFPB should do more than acknowledge such problems in a letter to lawmakers. Frotman, of the Student Borrower Protection Center, says the bureau has broad powers to compel student loan servicing companies to turn over the information it needs about student loans and student borrowers.

""I think just identifying this fact is of little solace to student loan borrowers who desperately need the help of a consumer financial watchdog that is supposed to be independent,"" Frotman says. He says he'd like to see Kraninger more directly demand that the Education Department change its guidance to loan servicers and tell them to cooperate with regulators. The CFPB could also take loan servicers to court to get the information it needs., Frotman says.

In a statement to NPR, the CFPB said: ""The Bureau continues to supervise the student loan market, as well as taking action against those who fail to comply with the law."" And the bureau says it is confident it can resolve the issues to achieve its mission of protecting borrowers.

But for its part the Education Department appears to be defending its stance — that loan servicers not hand over information to the CFPB. The department says in a statement that it takes privacy seriously along with the need to ""protect customers' personal data."" It says requests for information about student loan borrowers should be made to the department.

State regulators also say Education Department impeding oversight

Last month, 21 state attorneys general sent Education Secretary Betsy DeVos a letter calling on her to ""reverse the limitations"" the department has placed on student loan servicing companies sharing information with state law enforcement agencies.

The attorneys general said ""student loan information is vital to our efforts to protect consumers from illegal, unfair, abusive, or deceptive practices by actors in the higher education industry, in which the Department historically has been an important partner. However, the Department's policy reversal impedes states' ability to enforce the law and shields unprincipled industry actors from regulatory enforcement, harming student loan borrowers nationwide.""

The industry group the Student Loan Servicing Alliance told NPR in a statement, ""As contractors of the Department of Education which owns its federal student loan data, federal servicers must follow federal law and ED guidance on disclosure and data sharing.""

Why not just share the information?

It's not clear why the department is blocking state and federal regulators from getting information from servicers to do oversight presumably aimed at protecting the rights of student borrowers.

Jason Delisle, a fellow at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute, says there may be a turf war going on here. Even if a particular student loan program has problems, Delisle says the department may feel, ""this is our program and we're designing it the way we want to design it and we're running it the way we want to run it."" And Delisle says if there are problems the department may feel it can sort them out by itself.

Frotman says that's not the issue. He says the Education Department may not like having regulators looking into alleged wrongdoing within the companies managing its loan programs, but ""this isn't about reasonable disagreements, it is about following the law versus obstructing law enforcement."""

They are worried about what Bill Barr and John Durham and the Inspector General Michael Horowitz are going to find,"" McDowell said while co-hosting ""The Five.""

US ATTORNEY JOHN DURHAM HAS BEEN REVIEWING ORIGINS OF RUSSIA PROBE 'FOR WEEKS:' SOURCE

On Monday, multiple outlets reported that Barr had appointed U.S. Attorney John Durham to examine the origins of the Russia investigation

A person familiar with the process told Fox News Tuesday that Durham has been working on his review “for weeks,” to probe ""all intelligence collection activities"" related to the Trump campaign during the 2016 presidential election.

The Russia investigation and Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report continue to be debated by Republicans and Democrats since its release last month.

In an interview that aired on Fox News Thursday, Barr explained that he is trying to get to the bottom of whether or not “government officials abused their power and put their thumb on the scale” during the early stages of the Russia probe.

McDowell also said Americans deserve to know the truth.

""[According to a Fox News poll released Thursday] a majority, 58 percent think it's at least somewhat likely the FBI broke the law when it started investigating the Trump campaign,"" McDowell said.

""They deserve answers. There is nothing wrong with a thorough look at it.""

Scott Pruitt, the former head of the Environmental Protection Agency, and his staff spent roughly $124,000 in excessive travel costs during a ten-month period, according to a new report from EPA's internal watchdog.

Pruitt, who resigned from EPA almost a year ago amidst a litany of ethics allegations, and his personal security detail flew in first or business class ""without sufficient justification and, initially without appropriate approval authority,"" the report says.

The EPA's Office of the Inspector General recommended that the agency consider recovering the estimated $123,942 in excessive costs.

In a statement, the EPA says it believes that it complied with federal travel regulations, ""making cost recovery inappropriate.""

The audit reviewed 40 trips, including six canceled ones, that Pruitt planned or took in 2017. Nearly half of those trips stopped in, or were to, Tulsa, Okla., where Pruitt maintained a personal residence while he was the nation's top environmental steward. The report found ""missing detailed support"" for some of those trips.

The travel during that ten-month period cost taxpayers almost $1 million.

Pruitt's 24-hour security detail ate up most of that money. In a previous audit, EPA's inspector general found that the agency spent twice as much protecting Pruitt as it did his predecessor.

The EPA and Pruitt, who now works as a consultant for coal companies, said those protections were necessary because of personal threats against the former-administrator.

During his 16-month stint as head of the EPA, Pruitt's security costs, travel and other actions drew criticism from his predecessors, Democrats, environmental groups and even some Republican lawmakers.

The EPA's inspector general says the office received numerous congressional requests and hotline complaints about Pruitt's travel. The new report came as a result of those.

In addition to first-class travel, the audit found that lodging expenses exceeded per diem limits during some of Pruitt's travel as well. There was also inaccurate or incomplete reports for international travel.

Pruitt is not the first member of the Trump administration to be questioned about his travel on the taxpayer dime.

Tom Price, the former head of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, broke federal rules on using chartered and military planes for government travel. Price resigned amidst controversy over that, as President Trump complained that he ""didn't like the optics"" of using taxpayer-funded charter flights.

A report by the Interior Department's inspector general found that former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke violated the agency's travel policy by having his wife travel with him in government vehicles.

The EPA's watchdog says that actions are needed to strengthen controls over travel at the agency to ""prevent fraud, waste and abuse."""
