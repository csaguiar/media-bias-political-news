"Trump announces deal to expand US beef exports in the EU — and jokes about Mercedes, BMW tariffs",https://www.cnbc.com,['Jacob Pramuk'],08-02-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/02/trump-trade-announcement-on-eu.html,"President Donald Trump announced an agreement Friday to boost beef exports to the European Union.

Surrounded by trade officials and beef industry representatives at the White House, Trump signed a deal to ""lower trade barriers in Europe and expand market access for American farmers and ranchers."" Over the course of the agreement, annual duty-free U.S. beef exports to the EU are expected to nearly triple to $420 million from $150 million, according to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative.

""This is a tremendous victory for American farmers, ranchers and of course, European consumers,"" the president said at the White House as he unveiled the deal.

The agreement comes as the agriculture industry has taken a hit from Trump's ongoing trade war with China. The president has tried to limit the economic and political damage from the conflict ahead of the 2020 election. His administration recently announced details of a $16 billion aid package for farmers affected by the trade conflict."
‘We’re All Tired of Being Called Racists’,https://www.theatlantic.com,['Elaina Plott'],08-02-2019,2019,8,https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/08/trump-supporters-called-racists/595333/,"Read: Two nights, two very different ways of talking about race

“It’s sad,” he continued, “that using ‘racism’ has become the easy button of left-wing politics. All right? Because guess what? It still is an issue … But by making a mockery of it by saying every time you can’t win a fight—‘Oh! We’re just gonna push the button! It’s racist’—you hurt those that are actually afflicted by it. People hear it, they roll their eyes, and they walk on. And that’s a disgrace, and that’s what you’ve been given in the identity politics of the left.”

The crowd erupted in jeers and boos. It was a segment of Jr.’s speech that in many ways echoed that of a speaker who’d appeared before him, Brandon Straka, a gay Trump supporter who founded the WalkAway movement to encourage people to leave the Democratic Party. “Insinuations of bigotry and racism,” Straka claimed, were “divisive tactics” used by the “liberal media to control minorities in this country.” “This is a president who serves minorities,” he said, “because he loves minorities.”

As speakers mounted their defenses of the president, it seemed apparent that supporters were cheering them on as a means of affirming not just Trump, but also themselves. Because to accuse a politician of holding virulent racist beliefs is also, if only implicitly, to condemn his or her voters of harboring those same tendencies.

And that’s what the rally-goers I spoke to last night seemed most nonplussed by—not so much that Trump had been roundly condemned in recent days as a racist, or a bigot, but that they, by virtue of association, had been as well. But rather than distancing them from Trump, the accusations have only seemed to strengthen their support of this president. To back down, they suggested, would be to bow down to the scourge of political correctness.

“We’re all tired of being called racists,” a 74-year-old bespectacled white man named Richard Haines told me. “You open your mouth, you’re a racist. My daughter is a liberal, and she’s [using the word] all the time. We don’t talk politics; we can’t—all the time she always accuses me of hate.”

Haines, who told me he had just returned to the United States from Thailand, where he had done missionary work for 15 years with impoverished children, said that he knew what real racism looked like—that his father was a “bigot” who “didn’t like black people.”

“Donald is not racist, you know?” Haines said. “He makes a statement, and they take the words out of context and try to twist everything so that he’s a racist. And I think it’s gonna backfire.”

Before the rally began, I sat down on the floor of the arena with two women—Roseanna, 50, and Amy, 48—who felt similarly. (Neither woman was comfortable providing her last name for this story.) Roseanna, who wore a red T-shirt, white shorts, and a MAGA hat adorned with multiple buttons, including one featuring the likeness of Hillary Clinton behind bars, had driven an hour and a half from Lexington, Kentucky. She defended Trump’s statements about Baltimore. “He didn’t say nothing about the color of somebody’s skin,” Roseanna said, yet it seemed like everyone was “wishing him toward ‘He’s a bigot.’



“I’m sick to death of it. I have 13 grandchildren—13,” she continued. “Four of them are biracial, black and white; another two of them are black and white; and another two of them are Singapore and white. You think I’m a racist? I go and I give them kids kisses like nobody’s business.”"

Brittany Kaiser first emerged in last year’s Cambridge Analytica scandal as a seemingly nefarious figure, an insider steeped in the dark secrets of a new kind of voter manipulation powered by Facebook data. To make matters worse, news reports also raised questions about Kaiser’s mysterious dealings with WikiLeaks mastermind Julian Assange at a time when he remained holed up in the Ecuadoran embassy in London.

For Kaiser — at the time a 30-year-old Democrat from Texas who’d become business development director for Cambridge Analytica, a firm created to elect Republicans — the massive wave of critical news reports about the company threatened to deliver catastrophic damage to her reputation and even made her fear possible arrest.

So she did something drastic: Kaiser fled to Thailand, and she let a crew of filmmakers tag along.

What followed was a highly public — and still unfinished — quest for moral redemption that has played out across the globe and, now, in a Netflix documentary called “The Great Hack,” released July 24. It includes images of Kaiser up to her shoulders in a giant pool under an impossibly blue sky in Thailand, uncertain what to do. And it later depicts Kaiser, in a far more determined frame of mind, testifying before the British Parliament about the many unsavory deeds of her former employer and warning of the ongoing privacy threats posed by Facebook, whose dealings with Cambridge Analytica resulted in July in more than $5 billion in U.S. fines.

But two important elements are missing from the film. The first is Kaiser’s private meetings with British and U.S. prosecutors, including those from then-special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s office, which she recently detailed in interviews with The Washington Post. In these she also explained her visit with Assange in 2017 and how close she came during the hottest days of the Cambridge Analytica scandal to turning over the entirety of her hard drive to WikiLeaks for publication online.

The second missing element is a decisive moment of reckoning for Kaiser, during which she fully acknowledges her role in matters she now regards as wrong and possibly illegal. She repeatedly calls herself a “whistleblower” but viewers of the film may wonder: Why didn’t she blow the whistle a little sooner — ideally before Cambridge Analytica’s misdeeds had become front-page news worldwide?

It’s a question, Kaiser told The Post, that she still struggles with herself.

“I used to make so many excuses to myself,” she said. “I used to make excuses to my friends and family on why I was there and that it was okay to be working with these people and that what they were doing wasn't all that bad, and I was just doing my job. I look back at some of it, and it's shocking.”

Kaiser’s efforts to wrestle with this legacy in such a profoundly public way shoots a charge of emotional electricity through a film otherwise devoted to distinct heroes and villains. She occupies a middle ground of moral complexity while she seeks to emerge from what she now depicts as a fever that consumed more than three years of her life.

“She knew before the story blew up that the rights of Americans had been violated,” said David Carroll, an associate professor of media design at the New School in New York and a hero in the film for his dogged legal battle to gain access to the data Cambridge Analytica had collected on him. He is among those who would think better of Kaiser had she spoken up about her qualms with Cambridge Analytica before the scandal erupted.

“Once that’s out, it’s hard to be a whistleblower,” Carroll said. “You’ve missed your chance.”

But whistleblower or not, Kaiser’s story is a compelling one for the insights it offers into the dark heart of Cambridge Analytica, the unregulated market for our personal data and also — and perhaps most importantly — what happens when questionable decisions get thrust to the center of the world’s white-hot gaze.

A job offer in the U.K.

Kaiser was a graduate student in international human-rights law at Middlesex University in London when she met Alexander Nix, the now-disgraced chief executive of Cambridge Analytica. The company had been created by Republican strategist Stephen K. Bannon, who served as the company’s vice president, with money donated by conservative financier Robert Mercer. And while the parent company, called SCL Group, meddled in elections across the world, Cambridge Analytica had a more specific brief — to use the emerging science of Big Data to help Republicans win U.S. elections.

Like the company’s well-known whistleblower, Christopher Wylie, who helped British journalist Carole Cadwalladr of the Observer expose Cambridge Analytica’s misdeeds, Kaiser was no conservative. She had dabbled in Democratic politics and at one point had aspired to work for Hillary Clinton’s campaign in 2016.

Nix, who appears in the film and in much of the news coverage as a particularly skilled manipulator of his fellow humans, lures Kaiser to join his company with the unforgettable line: “Let me get you drunk and steal your secrets.”

Kaiser, whose parents suffered serious financial troubles that led to the loss of their home the same year she started working at Cambridge Analytica, appears to fall hard for the unmistakable scent of money and power that wafts through the conservative political world Kaiser soon inhabits. The film shows her in a series of exotic locations, dressed in pearls with a champagne glass in hand and on shooting weekends with her new associates. During this phase, she even joined the National Rifle Association, a group seemingly at odds with her traditional political views.

“The Great Hack” also details how Cambridge Analytica gathered up data on a massive scale, using an online app to collect information on tens of millions of Facebook users — everyone who used the app and all of their friends — and also from data brokers. The goal was targeting them with messages designed to work on voters’ underlying psychologies. Perhaps the most appalling moment in the film comes as SCL Group orchestrates a voter suppression campaign in the Caribbean nation of Trinidad and Tobago that succeeds in helping a candidate of South Asian descent triumph when poorer, darker-skinned supporters mysteriously fail to cast ballots.

SCL Group reportedly also had a role in an operation in Nigeria in which an Israeli firm obtained private emails from that nation’s president, Muhammadu Buhari, when he was a candidate for office in 2015, according to Cadwalladr’s reporting that also tied Kaiser to the effort. (The article appeared in the Guardian, the sister paper of the Observer.) Those emails, like those of Democrats working to elect Clinton in 2016, mysteriously emerged online during the election season, hurting Buhari’s candidacy. Kaiser told The Post that she won the account for SCL but did not have a direct hand in the collecting or deploying of the emails.

But these events have kept Cadwalladr from regarding Kaiser’s efforts to redeem herself as entirely convincing, especially given that Kaiser decided to flee to Thailand shortly after the article about SCL’s meddling in Nigeria appeared, naming her. “I think it’s hard to know if she’s sincere or not because of the circumstances in which she chose to blow the whistle: the day after we revealed her role at center of particularly problematic election,” Cadwalladr said in an interview.

Kaiser has repeatedly portrayed her actions after leaving Cambridge Analytica as well-intentioned, driven by rising revulsion at the things she’d witnessed and a determination to speak out — classic whistleblower motives. Now that some official investigations are wrapping up, Kaiser says she’s eager to tell the full story. On Tuesday, Parliament released new documents that she had furnished on Cambridge Analytica’s role in the early days of the Brexit campaign, underscoring the importance of her cooperation.

That all of this coincides with the release of a largely sympathetic film and a Kaiser memoir, to be published by HarperCollins in October, only makes Cadwalladr warier — though she also praised Kaiser for providing evidence to authorities and said she wished others from Cambridge Analytica would follow Kaiser’s example.

“The problematic thing for me is her monetizing and exploiting this role, essentially,” Cadwalladr said. “There is this sort of hero-ization of her as a character, and that’s tricky given the many important still-unanswered questions.”

A moment of clarity

Kaiser said she began turning away from Cambridge Analytica and its sharply conservative, Fox News-driven world the night of Trump’s victory, which came as both a surprise and a shock to her political and moral sensibilities. For all of Cambridge Analytica’s claims about the power of its precise voter targeting, nobody knew how well it would work in the U.S. presidential election.

“I was then, like, ‘Wow, I was part of something that I shouldn't have been part of. I never thought that the campaign is actually going to win. Oh my God.’ He actually won through this, you know, racist, sexist rhetoric that has divided a country that was actually doing quite well,” Kaiser said.

Soon after, she found herself in a conflict with her bosses over her role in the company. A promotion she sought to Cambridge Analytica’s executive ranks didn’t come through. A hoped-for job in opening the company’s offices in Mexico City went to somebody else — a man — reactivating her feminist sensibilities.

“That's when the disillusionment really sunk in. And I realized these people could be doing a lot more than I know about, because they're cutting the corners that I see, and I'm not an executive of the company. So what else is going on?”

This dawning realization, however, was gradual enough that Kaiser still found herself hobnobbing around victory parties the night before Trump’s inauguration in January 2017. She dropped by one hosted by Britain’s Brexiteers and even made what she said was a brief appearance at the Deploraball, an event including members of what was then called the alt-right, who reveled in the strident, racially charged rhetoric of Trump’s campaign.

Inside the event, Kaiser said, she recoiled at a painting of George Washington wearing a red “Make America Great Again” hat.

“It was so offensive,” she recalled. “I went in there. I recognized some of the people around. Once I got inside and recognized some of the people that were there … I had to leave.”

She watched the inaugural the following day, at another party, atop the W Hotel overlooking the White House with a cocktail in her hand.

A meeting with Julian Assange

The event that would make Kaiser herself newsworthy happened a few weeks later, in February 2017.

She had a long-standing admiration for Assange and, in 2011, had donated about $200 worth of bitcoin to the group in honor of its work revealing a secret trove of U.S. military files related to the Iraq War. Kaiser had cited its work in her master’s thesis on war crimes.

But what ultimately brought Kaiser and Assange together was the death of well-known human rights lawyer John R.W.D. Jones, who was hit by a London train in an apparent suicide. Kaiser considered Jones, who had represented Assange, a mentor. When a mutual friend suggested that Kaiser and Assange meet to commiserate, she agreed in concept but was unable to arrange a meeting quickly. The Jones death happened in April 2016, as Cambridge Analytica’s campaign work was accelerating. In the aftermath of Trump taking office, with Kaiser increasingly questioning her life choices, the idea of meeting Assange gained traction.

But first she had to get through Assange’s gatekeeper, a gray-haired British man whom she knew only as “James.”

He and Kaiser met over tea at Harrods, the iconic London department store. The next day Kaiser visited with one of Assange’s lawyers for a second round of vetting. The third day, Kaiser, in the morning before heading to work at Cambridge Analytica’s London offices, walked up to the Ecuadoran Embassy, suddenly aware that she almost certainly was being watched, her name entered into the files of at least one government’s intelligence agency.

She also entered with full knowledge of the allegations that Assange had worked with Russians in manipulating the U.S. election but, at the time, dismissed the claims as hyperbole.

“All of this, to me it sounded, I hate to use the term, but it just sounded like ‘fake news.’ It sounded like a way to discredit what could have been credible information,” Kaiser recalled. “And so, unfortunately, the information bubble that I was in, actually being surrounded by Republicans and being surrounded by conservative messaging all of the time, looking back on it, I realized I was a lot more affected than I would have liked to believe at the time.”

By this point, Assange had been in the embassy, avoiding arrest, for more than four years and would be there for two more before authorities rousted him this past April. Kaiser, encountering him for the first time, was immediately struck by how pale he was — somehow paler even than the white, buttoned shirt he was wearing.

Yet despite his appearance — and a rambling conversation she recalled as mainly devoted to Assange monologues on several geopolitical subjects — Assange mustered enough charisma to calm Kaiser’s rising unease about the role Cambridge Analytica had played in electing Trump. Assange assured her Trump was a better choice than Clinton would have been, referencing some of the decisions she had made as secretary of state. “The one who didn’t have blood on his hands won the election,” Assange told her, according to her recollection.

The comment succeeded in soothing her, at least for a time. “I kind of viewed that as, well, Julian knows more than I do,” Kaiser said. “So maybe I should be calm about that.”

Flight to Thailand

But Kaiser was decidedly not calm, more than a year later, when the Cambridge Analytica stories broke in the Observer and the New York Times, triggering a global scandal. A few days later came the story, under Cadwalladr’s byline, about the SCL operation in Nigeria and Kaiser’s role in landing the contract.

James, her WikiLeaks contact, messaged that same day, through an encrypted app, wanting to talk, she said.

She was visiting San Francisco at the time and getting worried that authorities in both the United States and England might be looking to talk to her. She knew a lot about the role Cambridge Analytica had played in Trump’s election and also in the first phases of the Brexit campaign. But she wasn’t sure the official inquiries would be friendly. With the possibility of arrests in the back of her mind, Kaiser headed to the airport and off to Thailand for an unplanned vacation.

Kaiser agreed to meet with James a few weeks later when she was back in London, feeling a bit less in immediate peril.

In this second meeting, James made an intriguing offer: Why not turn over her laptop computer for publication online so that journalists, investigators and anyone else searching for the truth could simply crawl their way through the data and reach their own conclusions? Kaiser was desperate to clear her name. James said this was the best way to do it.

“He said, ‘Well, we can help you with that, but we publish indiscriminately,'” she recalled James saying. “'Nothing will be held back. Nothing will be redacted. We’ll publish the entire thing. Your whole hard drive.'”

So tempted was Kaiser by this offer that she made arrangements to take that step remotely — from wherever in the world she happened to be when she made the decision.

“I left a copy of my computer in London in a safety deposit box,” Kaiser recalled. “I had trusted people that had the password. And I knew that if I did make the decision, that someone in London would be able to pass it” to James and WikiLeaks.

And this is where the filmmakers, having trailed her all the way to Thailand and back, played a crucial role.

Telling her story

The team behind “The Great Hack” are Jehane Noujaim and Karim Amer, a married couple who already were working on a film on the dangers of modern technology when the Cambridge Analytica story broke, giving them an ideal frame for telling the story. They found Kaiser quickly upon her emergence in the coverage, and it was Amer who put her in touch with a contact he knew at the FBI.

That connection, which eventually brought her into contact with Mueller’s investigation and other ones in the United States, ultimately provided the most convincing act of redemption in Kaiser’s story.

“Her story is one that’s about power, about how power seduces and how power shapes us,” Amer said.

What he finds redemptive is the decision, however belatedly, to speak up.

“She didn’t need to do any of the things she did” in cooperating with authorities and the film. “She could have just walked away into the wilderness and never been heard from again, like so many people did at Cambridge Analytica.”

Kaiser sat for many hours of interviews with Mueller’s staff, as well as joint visits with investigators for the FBI, Securities and Exchange Commission and Federal Trade Commission. Kaiser talked about Cambridge Analytica. She talked about Facebook. She talked about WikiLeaks and meeting with Assange and the donation. She even gave investigators the number she had for James, which she presumed no longer worked.

The FTC and the SEC together levied more than $5 billion worth of fines against Facebook, and the FTC also sanctioned Cambridge Analytica’s Nix and the app developer from whom Cambridge Analytica bought the Facebook data. The British Information Commissioner’s Office, meanwhile, is in the final phases of a year-long investigation, with the help of Kaiser and others. She also turned over her laptop computer to U.S. investigators — and not to WikiLeaks — along with hundreds of thousands of emails and other documents.

Cambridge Analytica, meanwhile, dissolved in infamy.

The extent of the danger to Kaiser was underscored not long after she first established contact with the U.S. authorities. Another article came out — again by Cadwalladr — about Kaiser’s meeting with Assange.

The story was not a flattering one, and Kaiser disputes the characterizations in it, if not the basic facts. The article reported that Kaiser and Assange met “to discuss what happened during the US election” and that Kaiser claimed to have “funneled money” to WikiLeaks.

In her interviews with The Post, Kaiser said the election barely came up in her one meeting with Assange and the only thing that may have qualified as “funneling” was the bitcoin donation in 2011, before Cambridge Analytica was founded.

Cadwalladr, in speaking to The Post, said of Kaiser’s criticisms, “We sent her a formal right to reply which set down specifically and in detail what we knew and were planning to say and gave her the chance to respond and she didn’t. We therefore based the story on what we knew. We updated it later to reflect her later statements.”

All of which brings back the question of Kaiser’s reputation, which she has worked so hard to rehabilitate. What of it now?

Kaiser wants to be remembered more for what happened after Cambridge Analytica imploded — for working with investigators and, in the interest of not disrupting investigations, holding her tongue on sensitive matters until they could conclude their work. Some questions about her actions, she said, would have been clearer sooner if she had felt free to speak out. That was part of the price of working with authorities, she said, and that price was worth it to her.

“I definitely made the right decision,” Kaiser said. “A lot of the investigations are still ongoing. So I’m really hoping that we’re going to have a result where if people did commit crimes, that they are held to account. As of right now, there are multiple people that I think should be held to account that haven’t yet, and so we’ll see where that goes.”

As for what happened before, she sometimes speaks as if it were another person — or another version of herself — that fell so deeply into a world she now openly despises. The fever, she knows, held her far longer than it should have.

“It started to break down gradually,” she said. “I’m sad that it took me so long to erode this outer shell that I had developed from working there.”

If that falls short of the abject apology that some viewers of “The Great Hack” may crave, she offered this in her interviews with The Post:

“I’m incredibly sorry about letting the wool be pulled over my eyes,” Kaiser said. “I think of myself as intelligent and strong and principled. And look what happened. If it happened to me, it could happen to anyone.”"
Pollster: Voter dials show independents siding with Trump on immigration,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Joshua Nelson', 'Joshua Nelson Is A Freelance Reporter For Fox News.']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/pollster-voter-dials-immigration-trump-rally,"Pollster Lee Carter measured the responses of a group of 100 voters to President Trump’s rally in Cincinnati and she said Friday that independents are leaning toward the president's immigration stance.

At one point in the speech, Trump said Democrats’ greatest “betrayal” was supporting “open borders’ and Democratic lawmakers “care more about illegal aliens than they care about their own constituents.""

“We’re not going to do that,” Trump said to his base at the rally on Thursday.

Carter, president of communications consulting firm Maslansky + Partners, said the voter-reaction analysis showed independents tracking closer to Republicans than Democrats in response to those statements.

She said Republicans graded those comments with an A+ and Democrats rated them with an F, but independents graded them with a B-.

“I think this is so interesting, how divided we are on immigration. Democrats really are not for open borders. But when you look at those independents, they were right up there with him,” Carter told ""Fox & Friends.""

Carter said the strongest candidate on immigration at the Democratic presidential debates this week was former Vice President Joe Biden because he supported “stronger borders.”

“I think the Democrats really need to be careful about this issue because that really fires up a lot of folks,” she said, adding voters did not like candidates going after former President Barack Obama's policies.

Jonathan Ernst | Reuters

The nearly two-year special counsel investigation of Russian election interference led by Robert Mueller cost nearly $32 million in total, a new filing shows. The expenditures report, shared with CNBC by the Department of Justice on Friday, covers the final eight months of the probe, in which the special counsel spent about $6.56 million. About $4.12 million of that was spent through the special counsel's office directly, and $2.44 million came from DOJ components that supported Mueller's office. The first 16 months of the probe cost $25.2 million in total.

The special counsel's fourth and final spending report took significantly longer to disclose than prior filings, and arrived weeks after Justice Department officials expected it to be made public. But even in its absence, political leaders including President Donald Trump and House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., have made the cost of the investigation a focal point of their arguments for or against it. Trump, without providing evidence, has asserted since at least November of last year that the investigation cost more than $40 million. But Democrats have countered that the millions of dollars estimated to be forfeited from individuals found guilty through the probe — such as Trump's former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort — effectively zeroed out the costs. ""You secured the convictions of President Trump's campaign chairman, his deputy campaign manager, his national security advisor, and his personal lawyer, among others,"" Nadler said at the start of Mueller's historic testimony before the House Judiciary Committee last week. ""In the Paul Manafort case alone, you recovered as much as $42 million, so that the cost of your investigation to the taxpayers approaches zero."""
Top State Department adviser fired over 'abusive' management style,https://www.politico.com,"['Nahal Toosi', 'Eliana Johnson']",08-02-2019,2019,8,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/08/02/top-state-department-adviser-fired-1444894,"Kiron Skinner, a senior adviser to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, was fired this week over what some described as her ""abusive"" management style. | Sean Gallup/Getty Images foreign policy Top State Department adviser fired over 'abusive' management style Kiron Skinner, the director of the Policy Planning Staff, was told on Thursday that she was being dismissed.

A senior adviser to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was fired this week over what officials described as her “abusive” management style, including making homophobic remarks and accusing people of having affairs, according to two people.

Kiron Skinner, the director of Policy Planning, was told Thursday that she was being dismissed, a Trump administration official said. A senior State Department official also confirmed the firing, saying that several members of Skinner’s staff had threatened to quit if she wasn’t removed.

Two other State Department officials said Skinner acted unprofessionally in multiple ways, including yelling in public spaces and using homophobic language. She retaliated against employees by kicking them out of their offices and even alleged that some people were having affairs, the two officials said.

“It was an abuse of authority,” one of them said.

Skinner did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday.

One of the few prominent African American members of the Trump administration before leaving this week, Skinner is close to a number of conservative luminaries, such as former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice.

She hails from an academic background, and was brought in to help the State Department think in long-term, strategic ways about foreign policy. But she’s also long had a reputation for having sharp elbows — many of her past associates, especially in academia, flat out refuse to talk about her.

Pompeo hired Skinner to head the Policy Planning Staff almost a year ago, describing her as “a national security powerhouse” and “a one-woman, strategic thinking tour de force” in a statement to The Wall Street Journal. “I’m confident that she will enhance our influence overseas, protect the American people, and promote our prosperity,” he said.

She succeeded Brian Hook, who now serves as the special envoy for Iran issues.

Under Hook and then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Policy Planning was unusually active, participating in day-to-day policymaking and almost functioning as a mini-State Department. The set-up infuriated other bureaus in the department, who felt their ideas were ignored.

When Pompeo took as secretary of State, he decided that Policy Planning — also known as S/P in department lingo — should revert to its more traditional role of acting as an in-house think tank with long-term ideas and strategies.

Skinner appeared on board with that, and her staffers — some of whom she recruited from academia — spent much of their time churning out white papers and other documents on major geopolitical issues.

She kept a tight rein on the S/P crew, warning them in particular to avoid the media.

But, according to State Department officials, she also was such a poor manager that almost a third of the 20-plus member staff quit or moved to other positions during her time at the helm. Another five people recently threatened to leave if she wasn’t ousted, the officials said.

It’s unclear how much influence Skinner has on Pompeo, who is traveling in Asia this week.

The secretary of State has surrounded himself with several advisers, including well-respected career diplomats, who vie for his attention. There’s also Hook, several other special envoys who deal with specific hot-button issues, and Mary Kissel, a former Wall Street Journal opinion writer who advises Pompeo on policy and messaging.

Skinner was recently tasked with coordinating the work of a special panel Pompeo established to re-examine the basics of human rights policy. The panel, called the Commission on Unalienable Rights, has drawn fierce criticism from human rights activists who fear its aims are to undercut gains made by women and LGBTQ people.

A second Trump administration official who knows Skinner told POLITICO earlier this year that Skinner “believes very strongly in what [President Donald Trump] is trying to do on foreign policy — a resource-constrained, realist approach to the world.”

Skinner is particularly interested in China. Earlier this year, she drew public criticism after describing China as a civilizational threat to the United States, and claiming — erroneously — that it was the first non-Caucasian challenger.

Critics decried her framing of the Chinese challenge as unhelpful, while noting that Japan was once a major competitor to the West. Supporters insist she merely had a rare stumble in her speaking, pointing out that she’s known for being especially erudite, including in the classroom.

“She engages incredibly well. She cares about her students,” said Ken Weinstein, president of the Hudson Institute, who met Skinner while in graduate school at Harvard University.

Weinstein, in an interview several weeks ago, said Skinner stood out at Harvard for more than just her ethnic background and political views.

“She’s also been someone who’s always argued that our elites are too self-referential, too small — she’s always made the case for diversity,” Weinstein said.

According to her bio page at Carnegie Mellon University, where she's long held a post, Skinner earned graduate degrees from Harvard and undergraduate degrees from Spelman College and Sacramento City College.

She gained celebrity status in conservative circles early on in her academic career for her books on Ronald Reagan. One in particular, “Reagan: In His Own Hand,” was based on handwritten notes of the former president that Skinner found during archival research.

The book gave voice to those who have long argued that Reagan had a far more active, intellectual mind — one that grappled with a range of domestic and foreign policies — than he’s given credit for.

One of Skinner’s supporters has been Kay Coles James, president of the conservative Heritage Foundation. The two became close friends years ago after James saw Skinner interviewed on C-SPAN and reached out to her.

James said in an interview earlier this year that Skinner is a “workaholic” and that “nothing excites her more than research, writing and speaking.” James waved off Skinner’s reputation as headstrong and sharp-elbowed.

“As a fellow African American female conservative Republican that’s sort of an occupational hazard,” James said at the time. “When a male does exactly the same thing it’s viewed as someone who stands his ground. We are viewed as witches with capital Bs.”

On Friday, after learning of Skinner's firing, James said in a statement that her friend ""has a bright future ahead of her.""

""Unfortunately, this isn’t the first time I’ve seen what happened to Dr. Skinner play out in Washington. I’ve only known her to be of the highest character,"" James said in the statement. ""Our country is better off because of her tireless work on behalf of America."""

The children's lawyer was incensed. Her two tiny clients — one of them blind — had been in a shelter for three months, separated from their mother.

The family had traveled from Mexico to the United States, reaching Nogales, Arizona, on March 1, 2018. Officials at the border found that the mother, Nadia Pulido, had ""credible"" reasons for seeking asylum from an ex-partner who, she says, beat her and stalked her after their relationship ended.

But U.S. Customs and Border Protection still sent Pulido into an adult detention center run by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. She had an hour to say goodbye and try to assure her blind daughter, 6, and sobbing 3-year-old son that she'd see them in a couple of hours.

""A couple of hours turned into months. Painful months,"" Pulido recalled in an interview.

To help the children, pro bono attorney Maite Garcia turned to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties. She filed a complaint with the office on June 7 of last year, explaining that Pulido's daughter was ""completely blind and requires assistance for daily living"" and would be better off with her stepfather, a U.S. citizen.

Nearly two weeks went by before the civil rights office replied.

""The issues you raise are very important to us,"" CRCL finally said in its emailed response. Then came a disclaimer: ""Please be advised that our complaint process does not provide individuals with legal rights or remedies. ... Instead, we use complaints like yours to find and address problems in DHS policy and its implementation.""

That was the last Garcia heard from the nearly 100-person office in Washington, D.C.

The tepid response from the department's civil rights office bolsters objections — not least from former staff — that the DHS watchdog is failing to stop rights abuses as they're happening inside a detention system that's expanding rapidly under the Trump administration.

The ineffectual handling of individual complaints adds to criticism that DHS leaders no longer heed recommendations from the agency's own civil rights experts.

""Put yourself in the shoes of the person who's sitting in the cell or who's separated from their parent or who's wondering where their child is,"" former CRCL staff attorney and adviser Ellen Gallagher said.

A recent whistleblower, Gallagher has accused the civil rights office of failing to investigate multiple individual complaints alleging unjustified solitary confinement of detainees in ICE custody. Gallagher is now with DHS' Office of Inspector General, a separate internal watchdog specializing in issuing reports after lengthy investigations.

""It seems to mislead the public, to invite complaints involving specific information about the individual or the family and the alleged violation, if Civil Rights and Civil Liberties had no intention of specifically investigating or resolving those individual complaints,"" Gallagher said.

Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan has insisted that DHS has ""layers of oversight"" to correct abuses. ""We have good supervisory oversight, and we hold people accountable,"" he said during a July 9 interview on CNN in response to questions about filthy conditions in CBP holding facilities.

Gallagher's impression, however, is that the civil rights office ""was actually fairly intimidated by ICE and CBP and did not want to engage in activity that might offend either. That is an odd and even disturbing posture for an oversight authority.""

Internal CRCL log: a flood of complaints

Some CRCL staff members say that individual employees contact CBP or ICE to try to informally resolve civil rights complaints. But they can only advise agencies, they say, because their office isn't set up to halt abuses as they happen.

Cameron Quinn, chief of the civil rights office and an appointee of President Trump, declined a request for an interview. Another CRCL official responded in writing to questions, asking not to be quoted by name.

""CRCL does not have authority to remedy individual complaints but instead focuses on systemic issues"" at DHS, the official wrote. The office does have authority, however, to seek ""remedies"" for people facing disability discrimination, the official said, declining to elaborate.

""With regard to family separations,"" the official said, ""CRCL investigated the issue from a policy and process standpoint."" The civil rights office then sent its recommendations to ICE and Customs and Border Protection in a memo. CRCL declined to release the memo, calling it a ""deliberative"" document.

CRCL, the official added, still has ""open investigations"" into the separations of children under age 5, the separations of children with disabilities and standards for separating families based on parental criminal history.

The Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties was created along with the Department of Homeland Security in 2002. The office's mission is to advise the powerful federal department and prevent civil rights violations such as the post-Sept. 11 roundups of Muslims without due process. But some insiders say CRCL has always lacked teeth.

Last year, the civil rights office proved especially weak as complaints about due process concerns and family separations began pouring in — nearly 850 in the first half of 2018 alone, logged into a CRCL database. An independent journalist obtained a copy through a Freedom of Information Act request and then shared it with the Center for Public Integrity and NPR.

The complaints referenced more than 380 separated children 10 years old or younger, of which more than 120 children were age 5 or younger.

More than 140 complaints arrived before the Trump administration announced its ""zero tolerance"" policy on April 6, 2018. More than 160 cases of separation referenced in the log were carried out before that date. The zero-tolerance policy required separating families so that CBP could hold all adults for prosecution, even for a first-time misdemeanor illegal entry.

Former and current staff in the civil rights office say their colleagues were so upset by allegations in the complaints that they openly wept at desks as they reviewed the cases.

By May of last year, senior staff in the office had urged Quinn, in an internal memo, to challenge the separations. ""CRCL should express great concern over our exclusion from these critical decisions,"" which CRCL has the authority to review, the memo said. ""Deliberately harming children to deter parental behavior would require an exceedingly strong justification to pass muster as a reasonable seizure under the Fourth Amendment, among other concerns.""

Lawyer and former CRCL senior adviser Scott Shuchart, who resigned from the office last year, said his and other advisers' concerns were ""blown off"" by CBP and other DHS leadership in meetings.

One complaint to CRCL in January 2018 reported that CBP separated a 4-month-old infant from a Mexican father who had prior immigration violations but feared being sent back to Mexico.

Another reported that an 8-year-old said CBP officers ""kicked him and/or hit him with a shoe"" to wake him. Dozens of other complaints described children upset about their parents' uncertain whereabouts and abrupt disappearance — including a 14-year-old in CBP custody who said he was separated after a meal break and was then ""told by officers that his father would be deported.""

About 95% of all complaints logged came from the federal Office of Refugee Resettlement, a unit within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that's responsible for migrant-children shelters.

Former senior staff in this federal resettlement office say the volume of complaints is unprecedented. Robert Carey, ORR director during the final two years of Barack Obama's presidency, said he thinks ORR employees were trying to stop separations by filing complaints.

""You probably have a deeply traumatized, possibly hysterical child that you're trying to care for,"" Carey said. ""I'm guessing some of those cases would require ... the intervention of a therapist, particularly if you're talking about, in some instances, young children.""

HHS officials declined to make leaders in its Office of Refugee Resettlement available for an interview.

Most other complaints came from nonprofit legal aid groups — including 18 filed by the Phoenix-based Florence Immigrant and Refugee Rights Project, where Maite Garcia works.

The complaint about Pulido's blind daughter and toddler son appears on page 276 of CRCL's 366-page document.

Another Florence complaint filed on June 14 of last year appears on page 321. It raises objections to CBP's separation of a Guatemalan mother from her 17-year-old son — who is unable to hear or speak — without regard for his disability. The boy could have qualified to be ""paroled"" into the U.S., a conditional form of humanitarian release. But that never happened — and the case shows how a formal complaint can wither in the Department of Homeland Security's Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties.

Deaf boy's mom taken away

The story of the mother and her deaf son ""exhibits the cruelty, the chaos"" of how migrants are treated, said Elizabeth Jordan, an attorney with Denver's Civil Rights Education and Enforcement Center. She represented the mother while the woman was in ICE lockup in Colorado.

On April 25 of last year, the mother and her 17-year-old deaf son approached CBP officers after crossing the Arizona border and asked to apply for asylum.

The boy and his mother now live in Florida, where they are in the process of applying for asylum. In an interview, the mother, who asked that her name not be disclosed, said she'd worked previously in the state, sending money to Guatemala to rent a room for her son and pay his tuition at a school for the deaf there. She eventually returned to Guatemala to care for her son and her own frail mother.

Three months after she got there, her mother died, and her deaf son lost his primary caregiver. He'd long been bullied in Guatemala, and thieves had robbed him at gunpoint. Mother and son both set out for the United States some months later.

""I don't do this for me. I do it for him,"" she said, ""because I'm not going to be alive for all of his life.""

After Customs and Border Protection took her and her son into custody near San Luis, Ariz., the mother said, officers ignored her pleas to keep them together rather than place them in cages segregated by age and gender. Her son, she told the officers, needed her to interpret. When she protested further that her son was mute, she said an officer answered, ""He won't need to do much talking where he's going.""

At some point, while her son was asleep, guards took her out of her cage, the mother said, and transported her to an ICE detention center pending prosecution. She said she was told ""you have to pay for what you did"" because she'd been turned away at the border the year before. She was sentenced to 30 days in an Arizona jail for reentry and then transferred to an ICE detention center in Colorado, pending deportation.

Meanwhile, U.S. Customs and Border Protection had sent her son on a long bus ride to an Office of Refugee Resettlement shelter in Arizona, where his only means of communication was drawing pictures.

For more than a month, the mother pleaded in vain with detention guards, first in Arizona and then in Colorado, to arrange a video call so she could at least see and sign with her son. Medical records from the boy's time in the shelter indicate he was distraught: He struck his head against walls and cut himself with a paper clip. In an interview in Florida, interpreted by his mother, he said that to prevent him from getting out of bed one night, he was physically restrained.

""She was profoundly distressed and so worried about him,"" lawyer Jordan said of the mother. ""This is a person who has devoted her life to keeping him safe and getting the best she can for him. And then, for her to be totally unable to check in on him for weeks ...""

A round of emails between the boy's attorneys and DHS' civil rights office ultimately went nowhere.

Initially, a CRCL adviser seemed to be working on the Florence project's June 2018 complaint, arguing that the deaf boy merited humanitarian parole and that for two months the shelter hadn't ""provided him with the appropriate accommodations"" for his disability. The adviser wrote that the civil rights office was ""reviewing your concerns""; he asked for proof the boy was deaf.

In July 2018, one of the boy's lawyers emailed CRCL to write that when CBP held the boy in custody, he ""was able to understand that the agents were mocking him"" because they didn't believe he was deaf.

The lawyer further argued that CBP, ICE and the Office of Refugee Resettlement, the federal agency in charge of shelters, were all in violation of disability rights because they had failed to arrange a video call between the boy and his mother.

The official from the civil rights office then replied that he was ""unable to look into [the boy's] ongoing concerns"" because the teenager had been transferred by CPB, which is within DHS' jurisdiction, to ORR, which is not.

Instead, he suggested, the civil rights office could investigate the mother's concerns because she was in ICE custody, which, like CBP and CRCL, falls under DHS. The boy's attorneys gave the civil rights official contact information for Jordan, the mother's Colorado lawyer.

By that time, Jordan had already been emailing local ICE officials repeated pleas to set up a video call. The call finally happened — nearly three months after U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers had separated the mother and her son. But it wasn't because of action by DHS' civil rights office, Jordan said. It was because DHS was by then under court order to put separated migrant family members in touch with one another by phone and then reunite them.

""In my interactions with individual CRCL officers,"" Jordan said, ""I don't get the sense that they're out to lunch or bad people. I think that they just ultimately can't get much done. I think it comes from being really hamstrung by the fact that they have to work with ICE and get ICE to concur in their recommendations and actually make changes.""

In the children's interest

Although Trump ended his zero-tolerance policy in June 2018 after a public outcry, U.S. border agents have continued to separate families due to parents' criminal records, even for minor offenses, or because of prior deportations.

Immigrant rights groups have long pressed DHS to consider the children's interests, and they've noted that family separation ""causes great harm, disrupting emotional and psychological well-being.""

For failed asylum-seeker Nadia Pulido, the groups' pressure came too late.

Pulido was born in Mexico but is a fluent English-speaker who arrived in California as an undocumented child and was raised by relatives. She could have qualified for a special visa for abandoned children, but no one sought such a visa on her behalf. When she was ""literally just young, stupid and hanging around the wrong crowd,"" she said, she was convicted of robbery and deported.

Because of that history, U.S. Customs and Border Protection and ICE chose to send her children to a shelter and keep her in detention last year while her asylum case went forward.

ICE could have released her on humanitarian parole. Instead, she was held in detention for eight months, until she lost her asylum bid. She could have appealed, but that would have meant more detention — and more time apart from her young children. In the end, Pulido agreed to be deported to Mexico.

After four months in a shelter, Pulido's blind daughter and toddler son were finally released to her husband, a U.S. citizen. Attorneys for the children and Pulido believe a federal lawsuit that led to a court order unifying migrant families was likely a factor. And they doubt their complaint to DHS' civil rights office did anything to hasten the children's release.

In Mexico, where the kids have now joined her, Pulido said she's still scared. To support her need for refuge, she presented Mexican police reports about incidents involving her ex-partner; and in her asylum application, she wrote that he assaulted her while she was pregnant and held a gun to her head.

""We were leaving Mexico to seek help in the United States,"" she said, ""to stay free of danger.""

Joe diGenova: Barr's Comey decision was the right call. But this is just the beginning,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Joseph Digenova', 'Joseph Digenova Was Us Attorney For The District Of Columbia', 'An Independent Counsel.']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/joe-digenova-barr-james-comey-leaks-decision,"The decision not to prosecute former FBI Director James Comey over his deliberate leaks to the media isn’t a sign of weakness or lack of will, but of the professionalism and well-reasoned restraint of President Trump’s Department of Justice.

Attorney General Bill Barr’s number one goal since taking the helm at the DOJ has been to restore the impartial and professional ethos that has characterized that agency for more than 200 years.

He is working diligently to cleanse it of the stain of politically driven vindictiveness that Obama-era officials created by grossly mishandling the Clinton email investigation, and then, even more egregiously, orchestrating the series of events that led to the Russiagate witch hunt.

ROBERT MUELLER'S RUSSIA INVESTIGATION BY THE NUMBERS

Before this “investigation of the investigators” is over, there will undoubtedly be many cases of misconduct that warrant criminal prosecution. Comey’s, however, was not one of them.

What Comey did -- release private memos made in the course of his employment as FBI director to politically damage the president of the United States, who had just fired him for unrelated misconduct -- was absolutely outrageous, and totally unbecoming of the leader of this country’s premier criminal investigatory agency. It speaks volumes about Comey’s corrupt character and further illustrates why both President Trump and then-Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein concluded that Comey was no longer fit to serve in that role.

Attorney General Barr made the right call. This would have been the first major charging decision of this investigation, which is not the time to go all in on a “maybe” case. To do so would create exactly the appearance of political vindictiveness and retributivist prosecution he is working so hard to dispel.

In this case, however, even that deplorable conduct did not rise to the level that was possible to prosecute criminally. The career prosecutors assigned to the case told Fox News that this “wasn’t a close call,” and I can see why. The confidential nature of the memos was too ambiguous. The intent element was too hard to prove.

Attorney General Barr made the right call. This would have been the first major charging decision of this investigation, which is not the time to go all in on a “maybe” case. To do so would create exactly the appearance of political vindictiveness and retributivist prosecution he is working so hard to dispel.

That does not mean, as some are now claiming, that the decision not to prosecute in this particular case is a vindication of Comey, a defeat for the president, or an end to the inquiry surrounding these leaks.

The quest for truth is far more important than the pursuit of retribution against an already-disgraced FBI official whose behavior in office was unbecoming of any public official. There are many of us who want to see James Comey before a jury or in a jail cell, but like Attorney General Barr, I’m more interested in seeing a full and complete accounting of the malfeasance that took place at the DOJ during and after the 2016 presidential campaign.

The release of a pending report by Inspector General Michael Horowitz is, by all accounts, imminent. The product of more than 16 months of investigation, that report will cover far more devious schemes than Comey’s leaking -- Horowitz is finally going to reveal the truth about the dishonest handling of FISA spy-warrant applications against Trump associates.

Horowitz, like Barr, is a true professional. His intrepid work revealed to the world the whole picture of Comey’s number two, Andy McCabe, whose own improper leaks to the media got him fired just days before he would have been eligible for a government pension. It was his extensive investigation through which we learned the full extent of FBI Agent Peter Strzok and DOJ lawyer Lisa Page’s anti-Trump text exchanges that disqualified Strzok from further participation in Special Counsel Mueller’s probe.

The investigation of the investigators is only just now coming into focus. We already know there was wrongdoing throughout the Obama DOJ, and that it continued among the holdovers from that era after the 2016 election -- and we know that it fueled the most pernicious conspiracy theory in modern American history. Some of that wrongdoing may well be prosecutable.

If and when such cases arise, the president’s supporters will be glad that Attorney General Barr and his team exercised such restraint in the Comey case. The American people will now be assured that any prosecutions that do go forward will be well-founded, readily provable, and completely devoid of the taint of politics.

We can all now appreciate a return to integrity at the DOJ. The American people deserve nothing less.

Defense secretary to review $10 billion cloud computing deal,https://www.cnn.com,"['Michael Warren', 'Alex Rogers']",08-01-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/01/politics/esper-pentagon-cloud-contract/index.html,"Washington (CNN) The Pentagon said on Thursday that a highly sought-after cloud computing contract will not be awarded until Secretary of Defense Mark Esper has completed his examination of it.

The $10 billion, 10-year contract, known as the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (JEDI), has come under recent scrutiny from President Donald Trump, who has expressed concerns over the fairness of what has been a contentious bidding process among a handful of large tech companies.

Amazon has been widely seen as the front-runner to win the contract. Microsoft is the other finalist. The contract could be awarded as early as August 23.

The announcement from the Pentagon comes less than a week after CNN exclusively reported that Trump had seen and been briefed on a document alleging a large conspiracy to award Amazon the contract. The one-page document was produced by an executive at Oracle, which had also competed for the contract. It's unclear how the document made it to the White House.

The document contains a flow chart titled ""A Conspiracy to Create a Ten Year DoD Cloud Monopoly,"" and provides a visual representation of a narrative that Oracle has been pushing for months -- that a web of individuals inside and outside the Defense Department were greasing the wheels for Amazon to win the contract.

The JEDI contract has been the subject of an intense lobbying effort by Oracle, which has been trying to scuttle Amazon's bid for months. Oracle's own bid did not make it to the final stage . The company also launched a failed legal challenge of Amazon's bid.

While it's unclear how Oracle's document made it to the White House, it seems to have played into the President's well-known animosity toward the online retail giant and its founder, Jeff Bezos.

Thursday's announcement raises questions about whether there is now political influence on a bidding process that up until now the Pentagon has insisted has followed all proper protocols.

Many of the implied and explicit allegations involving Amazon have been addressed by an internal Pentagon investigation or in Oracle's lawsuit in federal court. Neither have determined them to be problematic.

In recent weeks, the President has indicated he has concerns over the JEDI contract, and that the administration will be reviewing the matter. The decision to revisit the contract, however, ultimately lies with Esper, the newly-confirmed secretary of defense.

When asked by a reporter about the contract during a July 18 appearance in the Oval Office with the prime minister of the Netherlands, Trump said, he'd been getting ""tremendous complaints about the contract with the Pentagon and with Amazon,"" including from Microsoft, Oracle and IBM.

""Great companies are complaining about it,"" Trump said . ""So we're going to take a look at it. We'll take a very strong look at it.""

On July 22, Trump retweeted a Fox News segment criticizing the JEDI contract as ""The Bezos Bailout."" It's not clear if the President had already seen the Oracle document by then.

Days after Trump's public statements, Esper also mentioned reexamining the contract. ""I've heard from everybody about JEDI Cloud, that's one of the things I'm going to take a hard look at,"" Esper told reporters at the Pentagon on July 24.

Recently, some Republicans on Capitol Hill have also been lobbying the Pentagon and the White House to revisit the contract, pushing forward similar questions raised by Oracle about the contract's fairness.

Senators Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Marco Rubio of Florida have written separate letters to the Pentagon raising concerns about moving ahead with the contract. Trump even discussed JEDI with Johnson on an Air Force One flight to Wisconsin in July, according to the senator's office.

Trump also called Rubio last month to share his concerns about the contract, according to a Rubio spokesperson. Trump gave the indication that he may get involved in preventing the awarding of the contract if necessary.

In a statement Thursday, Rubio said he was ""pleased"" that Esper is reviewing the contract. A Rubio spokesperson tells CNN the Florida senator's staff worked with the defense secretary's office on the issue before the announcement.

On July 23, a dozen Republican House lawmakers sent Trump a letter urging him to delay awarding the JEDI contract. The letter states that awarding the contract would be ""premature"" because the Pentagon's Office of Inspector General ""is still investigating potential conflicts of interest by DoD employees in awarding the JEDI contract.""

Womack told CNN last week he had questions about whether there were conflicts of interest involving Amazon and the Pentagon.

""Given the many shortcomings of the JEDI procurement process, I fully support Secretary Esper's decision to review the program,"" Womack said in a statement Thursday.

But other Republican members have urged the administration to award the contract soon. A July 18 letter to Trump signed by four GOP members of the House Armed Services committee, including ranking member Rep. Mac Thornberry, stated that ""further delays will only damage our security and increase the costs of the contract."""

The agency, which runs nine low-income housing facilities in South Bend and is financed by the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development, has been beleaguered by complaints of financial mismanagement for much of the decade.

Urgent care services are now offered to veterans through Veteran Affairs urgent care clinics.

The program, which started June 6, offers services to those suffering from the flu, minor burns or skin infections at locations like MedExpress, UPMC Urgent Care and MinuteClinic, located inside CVS stores.

Retail locations include a walk-in health clinic within a retail business. These locations can help treat uncomplicated illnesses like a sore throat or earache. At urgent locations, officials can diagnose or treat illnesses or injury for people seeking immediate medical attention for non life-threatening illnesses or injuries.

“The new urgent care benefit is not a substitute for emergency care for life-threatening conditions,” Dr. Ali Sonel, VA Pittsburgh chief of staff, said in a news release. “Veterans experiencing a medical emergency should call 911 or visit their nearest emergency department.”

In order to receive the benefits, veterans must have received health care services from the VA in the last 24 months. Veterans may be required to pay a $30 copay. Those wanting to stay with VA providers can call 412-822-2222 for in-person or video appointments.

The sparring comes amid the news that Comey will not be prosecuted by the DOJ even though the inspector general referred him for possible prosecution over the leak.

The full report from the inspector general is not expected to be completed until at least next month, according to The Washington Post.

The larger report focuses on federal authorities’ investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and the Trump campaign and Comey’s role in it.

Comey was fired from his post at the FBI by Trump in May of 2017 and has been an outspoken critic of the president since.

Meadows is an avid supporter of Trump and has called for an investigation into Comey and his handling of the Russia probe."
Richard Neal: Why the House needs Trump’s tax returns,https://www.washingtonpost.com,['Richard Neal'],07-31-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/why-my-committee-needs-the-presidents-tax-returns/2019/07/31/05d4505a-b3c8-11e9-8f6c-7828e68cb15f_story.html,"Richard E. Neal, a Democrat, represents Massachusetts’s 1st Congressional District in the House and is chairman of the Ways and Means Committee.

For three decades, the House of Representatives and its Ways and Means Committee have been the site of my life’s work. I never aspired to be a senator or governor or president.

Instead, I learned arcane House rules and sought a position on the Ways and Means Committee because of its tremendous potential to help my district. I have listened to my constituents on matters such as taxes, health care, international trade and Social Security, which are within the committee’s purview. Untold hours have gone into developing legislation and trying to improve, pass or defeat countless bills. That’s the job.

I’d rather hold a roundtable in Pittsfield, Mass., or cross-examine Medicare administrators than pick fights on cable news. Those arguments tend to drive people into their corners, shrinking opportunities to accomplish real results.

I’m an institutionalist. I respect Congress, for all its imperfections. As chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, I am responsible for congressional oversight of the Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service’s administration of the federal tax code. The tax code gives the committee chairman the power to request taxpayer information from the IRS. The committee has exercised this power at various times in the past and has never been denied by the IRS or the Treasury Department.

In early April, I requested the president’s tax returns to fulfill a legitimate congressional oversight responsibility: Our voluntary tax-compliance system hinges on the public’s faith that our tax laws are administered fairly and without favor to those in power. The president is unique: No other American has the power to sign bills into law and direct an entire branch of government. That power, and the extent to which the IRS can audit and enforce federal tax laws against a current or future president, merits closer legislative scrutiny.

The IRS has a policy of performing mandatory audits on all sitting presidents and vice presidents. But neither Congress nor the public knows anything about the scope of those audits and whether the president can exert undue influence on the IRS to affect his or her tax treatment. If, for example, the president is already under audit at the time he or she takes office, what happens to that audit? We don’t know.

My committee will consider legislation regarding the mandatory audit program to ensure these audits are conducted fairly and without undue influence from the commander in chief. And, as part of our deliberations, we must review his tax information to better understand the audit program and propose any needed changes.

The law on this is very clear: The IRS “shall furnish ” the Ways and Means Committee with the requested tax returns. Both Democrats and Republicans have made requests for taxpayer information under 6103(f)(1) of the U.S. tax code in the past. The Supreme Court has repeatedly held that Congress is entitled to a presumption that its investigatory activities are legitimate, and, in this case, the legitimacy is self-evident. And yet, the administration has stonewalled Congress, ordering the IRS commissioner not to comply with the plain language of the law and setting up a pending legal clash.

I did not pick this fight, but I will not shirk it because it’s about something much bigger than tax forms. This is not an exercise in political retribution: I am not willing to trade the reputation of the Ways and Means Committee for cheap political gains.

The committee is a venerable part of U.S. history, having given the nation Social Security, Medicare, the entire tax code, all of our trade agreements, and numerous programs serving children and families. This committee financed America’s role in both world wars, and its antecedent paid for the Lewis and Clark expedition. I have no intention of squandering my chairmanship of this distinguished panel on petty or malevolent efforts to embarrass the current president.

But in this country, we take seriously the Magna Carta’s precept of the rule of law, not the law of rulers. I will fight with everything I have to reassert Congress’s constitutional mandate to serve as an equal branch of government. This country has thrived through the centuries because we have durable political institutions with a robust system of checks and balances.

Our political institutions won’t continue to function unless we guard them vigilantly, and my colleagues and I in the House majority are committed to doing so. It is the root of our oath to uphold the law."
DoD reports higher costs for National Security Space Launch program,https://spacenews.com,['Sandra Erwin'],08-01-2019,2019,8,https://spacenews.com/dod-reports-higher-costs-for-national-security-space-launch-program/,"NSSL costs over the entire life of the program increased 7.2% — from $57.2 billion to $61.3 billion.

WASHINGTON — In a new update to its annual report on major acquisition program spending, the Defense Department estimates the total cost of the National Security Space Launch program is up by $4.1 billion since December 2018.

In the so-called Selected Acquisition Reports, DoD estimates the total cost of a program by including what it has already spent and what it projects to spend in the future. In a summary of the SARs for the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 released on Thursday, NSSL costs over the entire life of the program increased 7.2% — from $57.2 billion to $61.3 billion. The report says the cost growth is due primarily to increased investment in new launch systems providers to support national security space missions, and an increase of 19 launch services, from 160 to 179, based on satellite launch requirements.

The NSSL program was formerly known as the Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle program. Congress renamed it in last year’s National Defense Authorization Act in recognition that there are now reusable, in addition to expendable, launch vehicles.

The EELV program dates back to 1994 when President Clinton signed a National Space Transportation Policy assigning responsibility for expendable launch vehicles to DoD. The NSSL program is transitioning to new launch vehicles and is seeking to leverage the commercial space industry.

The update to the Selected Acquisition Reports includes details on major defense acquisition program cost, schedule, and performance changes since December 2018. The new figures for the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 include projected spending in the president’s fiscal year 2020 budget submitted to Congress on March 11.

“SARs summarize the latest estimates of cost, schedule, and performance status,” DoD said in a news release. “These reports are prepared annually in conjunction with submission of the president’s budget.”

Quarterly exception reports are required only for those programs experiencing unit cost increases of at least 15 percent or schedule delays of at least six months. The total program acquisition cost estimates provided in the SARs include research and development, procurement, military construction, and acquisition-related operations and maintenance. These totals reflect actual costs to date as well as future anticipated costs. All estimates are shown in fully inflated then-year dollars.

The cost of the Pentagon’s entire weapons portfolio was $2 trillion in 2018, up from $1.9 trillion in 2017. Quantity changes account for the majority of the increase.

The NSSL program is one of four Air Force major acquisition programs that have reported cost increases greater than $1 billion or 10% since December 2018. The other three are the B-2 Defensive Management System Modernization ($285.3 million, or 10.3%); the Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile ($5.2 billion); and the Joint Direct Attack Munition ($1.1 billion)."
EPA proposes easing air pollution permitting process,https://thehill.com,[],08-01-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/455854-epa-proposes-easing-air-pollution-permitting-process,"The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) moved to finalize a rule Thursday that would ease the air pollution permitting process for certain power plants and manufacturers.

Since the early days of the Trump administration, the EPA has argued the process for obtaining permits under the Clean Air Act, known as New Source Review (NSR), is too burdensome.

The agency's proposal seeks to make a regulation out of a 2018 memo from former EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt Edward (Scott) Scott PruittOvernight Energy: Trump EPA looks to change air pollution permit process | GOP senators propose easing Obama water rule | Green group sues EPA over lead dust rules EPA proposes easing air pollution permitting process Pair of GOP senators propose easing Obama water rule MORE that has already been challenged in court by environmental groups.

The Sierra Club said the proposed rule would allow “some of the wealthiest industries in our country to avoid cleaning up their air emissions instead of installing modern pollution controls on their dirty facilities.”

EPA argues it will help ease the process for facilities looking to install new equipment.

The NSR process at the crux of the proposed regulation kicks in both for new facilities and when power plants install new equipment or make changes that would significantly increase air pollution.

The debate between the EPA and environmentalists largely centers on how much pollution must be factored in when weighing changes at a power plant. Whether or not a plant has to install pollution controls hinges on that calculation.

Environmentalists say the law requires looking at the plant as a whole, including all the ways a facility decreases and increases pollution through its operations.

John Walke, clean air director for the Natural Resources Defense Council, said the EPA proposal weighs the increased pollution from one change against all the other decreases in the plant — something that ignores that net pollution may go up.

“You can’t cherry-pick the decreases because it’s allowing even greater increases to escape control,” he said, thus leading to more pollution. “And that’s really the point of this regulation, to allow greater increases to escape control.”

He gave the example of installing a new boiler at a plant. The new technology might be more energy efficient, but if the boiler is run more often than the old one, it will still produce more pollution.

The EPA pushed back against Walke’s assertion.

“Today’s proposal is an important step towards President Trump Donald John TrumpKentucky miners' struggle is that of many working Americans Cummings releases statement on attempted break-in after Trump attacks PhRMA top lobbyist to leave post MORE’s goal of reforming the elements of NSR that regularly discouraged facilities from upgrading and deploying the latest energy efficient technologies,” EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler Andrew WheelerOvernight Energy: Trump EPA looks to change air pollution permit process | GOP senators propose easing Obama water rule | Green group sues EPA over lead dust rules EPA proposes easing air pollution permitting process Green group sues EPA over lead dust rules it says are too lax MORE said in a release. “By simplifying the permitting process and implementing a common-sense interpretation of our NSR rules, we will remove a major obstacle to the construction of cleaner and more efficient facilities.”

But Walke said calling the changes “upgrades” ignores that they cause pollution.

“The EPA and industry like to call them upgrades and efficiency improvements cause that sounds nice and sounds like things we should be doing, but what that masks is that they are all activities that increase air pollution significantly.”"
Interior secretary will be allowed to meet with former fossil fuel clients starting this weekend,https://thinkprogress.org,[],,,,https://thinkprogress.org/interior-secretarys-ethics-pledge-is-set-to-expire-this-weekend-729e7e959374/,"Interior Secretary David Bernhardt’s ethics recusal will expire on Saturday. The ethics pledge banned Bernhardt from decisions involving his former firm’s clients for two years.

Bernhardt was also not able to meet with these companies, unless five or more other stakeholders were present and nothing relating specifically to the companies was discussed.

But all of this is set to change on August 3.

Prior to joining the Interior Department in 2017, Bernhardt worked as a lobbyist for the oil and gas industry via the Colorado law firm Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck.

Among the firm’s 22 clients that Bernhardt was prohibited from engaging with for two years under his ethics recusal were energy companies Halliburton, Eni, and Statoil (now known as Equinor). Other clients included industry groups such as the U.S. Oil and Gas Association and the Independent Petroleum Association of America (IPAA).

The end of Bernhardt’s recusal was marked on Friday by a ribbon-cutting ceremony hosted by the Clean Water Fund at a park across from the D.C. Interior headquarters.

During his time in the Trump administration, Bernhardt’s ethical issues have taken center stage. He has so many potential conflicts of interest to avoid that he carries around a card listing all of them so he doesn’t forget. A recent analysis by the Center for American Progress found that Bernhardt has more conflicts of interest than any other Trump Cabinet nominee. (ThinkProgress is an editorially independent news site housed at the Center for American Progress Action Fund.)

In April, Politico revealed that Bernhardt reportedly worked closely on matters he had pledged to recuse himself from. Just weeks after Bernhardt joined the administration, he was working on policies related key water infrastructure policy which he had worked on as a lobbyist. The ethics agreement had barred him from involving himself in “particular matters” with Westlands Water District for just one year, until August 2018.

The California water district is known for having tried to weaken the Endangered Species Act.

And in September 2018, an appearance by Bernhardt at a water industry forum in Colorado was canceled after department ethics officials concluded it could raise conflicts-of-interest concerns.

Public records released by the Western Values Project in February 2018 also that found Bernhardt’s former client, the IPAA, frequently communicated with Interior officials conducting a review of the department’s sage grouse policy. In March 2017, for instance, the IPAA thanked Bernhardt for his action as deputy secretary that benefited the oil and gas industry.

It’s not just Bernhardt though who has faced questions over conflicts of interest.

Just two weeks after Bernhardt was officially confirmed as head of the agency — following the departure of scandal-ridden former Secretary Ryan Zinke — the department’s Office of Inspector General (OIG) confirmed an investigation into six other senior DOI officials who may have also potentially violated their ethics pledges due to interactions with former employers and clients.

At the same time, this week, a slew of controversial new appointments were welcomed at Interior.

William Perry Pendley, a former senior official from the Reagan administration, was appointed acting director of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). Pendley, former president of the Mountain States Legal Foundation, has long fought to undo the federal government’s control over public lands.

In a 2016 National Review article, Pendley wrote: “The Founding Fathers intended all lands owned by the federal government to be sold… Westerners know that only getting title to much of the land in the West will bring real change.”

Pendley has in the past sued the Interior Department on behalf of the fossil fuel industry and has tried to undermine endangered species protections along with working to reduce the size of federal lands in favor of development.

Also this week, a climate denier tied to the coal industry was appointed as a senior adviser in the department. Christian Palich previously worked as the president of the pro-Trump Ohio Coal Association until 2017. Palich comes to the Interior this week from lobbying firm Siekman, Siekman & Associates, whose clients include Halliburton and pipeline firm Sunoco Logistics. He was also previously deputy associate administrator for congressional and intergovernmental affairs at the Environmental Protection Agency.

Palich has made numerous Fox News appearances praising President Donald Trump’s environmental rollbacks and he has frequently doubted established climate science on Twitter, calling it “junk science.”

After Trump’s election, for example, he tweeted: “Time to push fight [sic] back on all the radical enviro regs that have been illegally been [sic] brought on America over last 8 yrs.”

And finally, after 10 years, the department now has a Senate-confirmed inspector general. Mark Greenblatt — an attorney who previously worked at the Commerce Department’s Office of Inspector General — will be responsible for investigating allegations of ethics violations by Bernhardt and others at the department.

When pressed by lawmakers earlier this year on his appointment, Greenblatt asserted he had “zero intent” of shutting down any ongoing investigations into the department’s operations."

Mnuchin said the Treasury is very concerned about Facebook's Libra cryptocurrency and that he wants the government to ""make sure that the U.S. financial system is protected from fraud.”

The Federal Reserve took steps toward easing monetary policy on Wednesday, but the Treasury Department, no longer constrained by the debt ceiling, is poised to perhaps tighten financial conditions through its upcoming funding actions.

On Monday, the Treasury Department announced an aggressive plan to build up its cash balances. The Treasury is slated to borrow an additional $433 billion during the quarter that runs from July to September, with a stated ending balance of $350 billion.

In comparison, the Treasury borrowed just $40 billion from April to June.

The large increase in debt issuance has the potential to partially offset the monetary easing just announced by the Fed. As the Treasury floods the market with new debt to rebuild its cash reserves, the new supply could have the effect of driving down prices and driving up yields of Treasurys and other market-determined interest rates."
Multiple agencies coordinate with EPA for Mass City mercury spill cleanup,https://www.uppermichiganssource.com,[],,,,https://www.uppermichiganssource.com/content/news/Multiple-agencies-coordinate-with-EPA-for-Mass-City-mercury-spill-cleanup-513941201.html,"Representatives from Ontonagon County Emergency Management and the Western Upper Peninsula Health Department are working with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency following an accidental mercury spill at an abandoned garage and vacant lot in Mass City.

The spill was small, has been contained and is not a threat to the surrounding neighborhood.

The incident was first reported via law enforcement on July 28 and quickly worked its way through the emergency response system resulting in the arrival of the Health Department, EPA and hazardous materials cleanup crews shortly thereafter.

Following mitigation efforts, the effects of the spill have been minimized and both physical contamination of the property, a nearby home and adjacent vacant lot as well as air quality are being monitored by specialized equipment.

“This is a perfect example of how different agencies support each other during an incident,” said Mike Kocher, Emergency Services Director for Ontonagon County. “Everything starts and ends locally but when the call goes out, we coordinate, communicate and cooperate with a variety of response organizations to bring things to a successful conclusion, with the ultimate goal always being the safety of our residents.”

According to reports, the initial incident occurred when children entered the abandoned repair facility garage and discovered mercury in a small bottle. Their home is also being monitored for mercury levels.

Mercury is an element that has been used in thermometers, electric switches, lights, batteries and even in paper processing. Both the EPA and Western U.P. Health Department have published guidelines concerning what to do if involved in a larger spill. These include never using a vacuum cleaner or broom to clean up, never pouring it down a drain and never walking through it which can contaminate shoes and track it elsewhere.

""Mercury has interesting properties making it attractive to kids"" said Pete Baril, Emergency Preparedness Coordinator for the Western UP Health Department. ""As interesting and harmless as it may appear, mercury gives off toxic vapors that can be damaging to one’s health, especially children. We cannot stress enough the importance of getting rid of mercury sources in your home. If you have mercury in your home secure it and call your local health department for advice. We would much prefer to work with you on safely getting it out of your home than on a spill situation that can become very complicated very quickly.""

The US military spent $33 million on tech known to be vulnerable to Chinese cyberespionage,https://qz.com,[],,,,https://qz.com/1679475/dod-spent-30m-on-china-hackable-tech-from-lenovo-gopro-others/,"The US Department of Defense (DoD) purchased and used millions of dollars worth of electronics last year containing “known cybersecurity vulnerabilities” that make them particularly susceptible to Chinese government espionage. The findings are included in a recent audit (pdf) by the Pentagon’s Inspector General (IG) for DoD cyberspace operations, which warns that “missions critical to national security could be compromised” if the military does not take swift action.

Some models or brands of so-called COTS (commercial off-the-shelf) technology can allow adversaries access to communications infrastructure, command and control systems, and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance networks, says the partially redacted IG report.

To that end, at least $32.8 million in COTS purchases made by the US Army and Air Force during the 2018 fiscal year were singled out for concern. The products include software, cameras, and networking equipment red-flagged by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Joint Chiefs of Staff Intelligence Directorate, as well as computers that have been banned for use by State Department employees since 2006.

Repelling cyberattacks has become an increasingly worrisome problem for the military since the DoD was hit with its first significant cyberattack from China in 2003. Last year, the Chinese government hacked into a US Navy contractor’s computer network, gaining access to highly sensitive secrets about a classified undersea missile program. Also last year, a breach of DoD travel records exposed the personal information and credit card data of tens of thousands of servicemembers and civilians, although that has not been explicitly linked to Beijing, which reportedly maintains a cyberespionage force with nearly 200,000 members (pdf) spanning both the military and private sectors. What’s more, a report issued last October by the Government Accountability Office found “mission-critical cyber vulnerabilities in nearly all weapon systems” developed by the US military between 2012 and 2017.

“The Chinese have already broken into my stuff,” Army acquisitions official Lt. Gen. Paul Ostrowski told attendees at an event earlier this month. “The personnel system has been broken into. This is something that has risen to the top of the concern list. Not only within the Army, but within [the Office of the Secretary of Defense].”

Unheeded warnings

As much as 80% of the DoD’s systems are off-the-shelf items, or contain components that are commercially available, says the new IG report. Yet, there is no “approved products list to prevent unsecure items from being purchased.”

In one example highlighted by the IG, the Pentagon continued to buy and use video surveillance systems manufactured by two Chinese companies, Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology and Dahua Technology, for at least 16 months after the state department warned against it due to cyberespionage concerns. The DoD didn’t stop until August 2018, when Congress officially banned the federal government from doing business with the two firms.

The current items singled out as problematic by the IG include such household names as Lenovo computers, Lexmark printers, and GoPro cameras.

Lenovo

In 2006, the report notes, the State Department banned Lenovo products from its classified networks after reports that the company’s computers were being manufactured with hidden spyware and backdoors. In 2015, the DHS issued a warning about cybersecurity vulnerabilities in Lenovo devices, and in 2016 the Joint Chiefs of Staff Intelligence Directorate warned that Lenovo hardware posed a cyberespionage risk to both classified and unclassified networks and had the potential to compromise the entire DoD supply chain.

Still, the Army purchased 195 Lenovo products last year, for around $268,000, while the Air Force acquired 1,378 Lenovo products for $1.9 million.

Plenty of warnings about Lenovo products.

Lexmark

Last year, the Army and Air Force bought more than 8,000 Lexmark printers for about $30 million. The company is owned by a consortium of Chinese firms, and has links to the country’s military, nuclear, and cyberespionage programs, points out the IG report. A US government vulnerabilities database lists 20 known cybersecurity concerns pertaining to Lexmark, such as “storing and transmitting sensitive network access credentials in plain text and allowing the execution of malicious code on the printer,” which the IG says “could allow remote attackers to use a connected Lexmark printer to conduct cyberespionage or launch a denial of service attack on a DoD network.”

GoPro

The Army and Air Force also purchased 117 GoPro cameras last year, costing $98,000. The built-in wireless and Bluetooth capabilities, which let users share video in real-time, “have vulnerabilities that could allow a remote attacker access to the stored network credentials and live video streams,” says the report. “By exploiting these vulnerabilities, a malicious actor could view the video stream, start recording, or take pictures without the user’s knowledge.”

The DoD’s response to the IG report is almost entirely redacted.

A heavily redacted response.

Next steps?

The DoD must start to identify, assess, and mitigate cybersecurity risks posed by off-the-shelf technology before it is put into use, cautions the IG. However, the report points out that current DoD policy only mitigates cybersecurity risks “after purchase.”

“Despite DoD policies and the numerous organizations performing cybersecurity testing and analysis,” says the audit, “there appears to be no organization assessing the risks for COTS items DoD-wide, identifying high-risk items for further testing, or actively recommending prohibition of these high-risk items when necessary.”

It’s a serious enough problem that the IG believes a legislative fix might be the only answer.

In the meantime, says the report, “We recommend that the Secretary of Defense direct an organization or group to develop a risk-based approach to prioritize COTS items for further evaluation, a process to test high-risk COTS items, and a process to prohibit the purchase and use of high-risk COTS items, when necessary, until mitigation strategies can limit the risk to an acceptable level.”"
10-year Treasury yield dives to lowest level since 2016 after Trump announces new China tariffs,https://www.cnbc.com,['Thomas Franck'],08-01-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/01/us-treasury-yields-higher-after-fed-dampens-hopes-of-more-rate-cuts.html,"The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell to its lowest level since 2016 on Thursday after President Donald Trump announced new tariffs on Chinese goods.

The president said on Twitter that 10% duties will be imposed on $300 billion worth of Chinese goods, effective Sept. 1. Trump's tweets came after a U.S. delegation met with Chinese trade officials earlier this week.

At around 2:30 p.m. ET, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note had fallen approximately 15 basis points to 1.878%, its lowest level since November 2016. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond, which clinched its lowest level since October 2016 on Thursday, last traded at 2.428%. It hit a low of 2.422% earlier in the session.

""The tweet is bringing back the 'trade war' risk that markets have dealt with at various times over the past year. My guess is it is a negotiating tactic, but markets are concerned as the stakes are high and there is a chance it backfires,""said Arthur Bass, managing director of fixed income financing, futures, and rates at Wedbush Securities.

""Fed fund futures are now fully pricing two additional 25bp moves this year, although that could easily reverse if the risk-off move abates,"" Bass added. ""With today's move, fixed income investors will no doubt be positioned a bit long going into tomorrow's employment release,"" when the government will announce July's jobs data.

Yields were also under pressure Thursday after the Federal Reserve in the prior session cut interest rates for the first time since 2008.

In approving the cut, the FOMC pointed to ""implications of global developments for the economic outlook as well as muted inflation pressures."" It also characterized economic growth as ""moderate"" and the labor market ""strong,"" but eased policy regardless.

The 2-year Treasury note yield, more representative of changes to Fed policy, fell 16 basis points to 1.72%, off an earlier low of 1.694%, its lowest since November 2017.

The policymaking committee made explicit reference to inflation, a threat to bonds as rising prices chip away at the real value of their fixed payments."

Ratcliffe questioned intelligence community's role in Russia investigation,https://www.cnn.com,['Jeremy Herb'],07-31-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/31/politics/ratcliffe-investigating-fbi-doj/index.html,"(CNN) President Donald Trump's pick to be the next director of national intelligence, which has oversight over the CIA, has pushed for the Justice Department to investigate what role the agency and the broader intelligence community played in starting the counterintelligence investigation into Trump's team and Russia.

The comments from Rep. John Ratcliffe in television appearances and closed-door interviews with Obama administration officials questioning the US intelligence community's actions during the Russia investigation show how the Texas Republican aligns with the President's skepticism of the entire Russia probe, which ultimately became special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation.

Ratcliffe was one of the key Republicans leading the GOP-run congressional investigation into the FBI and Justice Department's handling of the Hillary Clinton email and Trump-Russia investigations last year. Ratcliffe had a central role in interrogating FBI and Justice Department officials on how the investigation began, and it helped Ratcliffe get on the radar of the President, who often seized on developments in the congressional investigation and twice this year tweeted about Ratcliffe's Fox News interviews.

A CNN review of the Republican-led interview transcripts from their FBI investigation, as well as dozens of Ratcliffe's Fox News appearances of the past year, reveal his deep skepticism of not just the FBI and Justice Department actions in 2016, but also of the intelligence community he would lead if confirmed to succeed Dan Coats as director of national intelligence.

Ratcliffe's worldview that emerged from his role in investigating the Russia investigation will now be thoroughly examined as he heads into the confirmation process to lead the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, particularly from Democrats who are criticizing his selection as overtly political.

While Ratcliffe didn't call for Mueller's removal or use inflammatory language like Trump -- he never called it a ""witch hunt"" or ""a hoax,"" for instance -- Ratcliffe questioned the actions of the former special counsel, argued that the beginning of the investigation had tainted his findings and accused Obama officials of potentially committing crimes. The Texas Republican criticized both President Barack Obama's CIA Director John Brennan and DNI John Clapper, his potential predecessor.

""Think about that, a dossier funded by the Democrats, peddled through the Obama intelligence community, falsely verified by the Obama Justice Department, then sold to the American people by those very same elected Democrats and willing folks in the media,"" Ratcliffe said in a March 24 interview with Fox News' Maria Bartiromo, the morning before Attorney General William Barr released his letter summarizing Mueller's findings

Trump signaled Tuesday that he expects Ratcliffe to clean house, telling reporters that he had picked Ratcliffe in order to ""rein in"" the intelligence agencies.

""I think we need somebody like that that's strong and can really rein it in,"" Trump said. ""As you've all learned, the intelligence agencies have run amok. They've run amok.""

Democrats say they will mount a fight against Ratcliffe's confirmation, and moderate Democrats like Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia are voicing their opposition to the three-term Republican. ""Anyone in the intelligence (community) should not be political at all. You have to get to the most non-political, non-partisan person you can find,"" Manchin said Tuesday. ""Why bring in someone who is so toxic?""

While many Senate Republicans have said they want more information before making a judgment on Ratcliffe, Senate Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr has signaled he will back Ratcliffe's nomination, praising his experience as a US attorney and serving on the Intelligence and Homeland Security committees.

Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham, who says his committee will also investigate the origins of the Russia investigation, said the intelligence community's role was a legitimate area for the Justice Department to probe.

""I think they should look at the FISA warrant. I think there's a lot of potential abuse,"" Graham said. ""I think Ratcliffe's got a worldview that I share, that he believes in a strong military, in engaging our enemies, in leading from the front not behind, so I'm OK with him.""

Ratcliffe's defenders argue he will win over his skeptics.

""I'm going to be really surprised at how many of his Democrat House colleagues that actually know him ... I'll be surprised they toe this line that he's some subjective loyalist incapable of putting his country ahead of his politics because anyone he knows him knows it's a damn lie,"" said former House Oversight Chairman Trey Gowdy, a South Carolina Republican.

Questions about the CIA

In recent weeks, Ratcliffe has endorsed Barr's investigation into the origins of the FBI's Russia probe, one in which the President has granted Barr declassification power and has instructed the intelligence community to cooperate.

""As he said, there was spying. The Obama Justice Department and intelligence community did spy on the Trump campaign. The question now that needs to be answered is, was there a predicate for that?"" Ratcliffe told Bartiromo in an April interview. ""This is why the focus needs to shift now to those folks in the intelligence community and at the Justice Department that made representations that there was probable cause, that there was evidence of collusion, when, in fact, the special counsel has found that there was none.""

Ratcliffe himself has raised questions about the role of former Trump campaign aide George Papadopoulos -- who was interviewed by the committees in October -- in launching the Russia investigation in July 2016, which began when Australian diplomat Alexander Downer reported his conversation with Papadopoulos about Russian dirt to the FBI.

But Ratcliffe and other Republicans have raised questions about Papadopoulos and what role the CIA may have played in Downer's interactions with him.

""There's been so much focus on the FBI and the Department of Justice. But a lot of the questions that relate to the origins of this go to the CIA,"" Ratcliffe told Fox News' Martha MacCallum in June. ""It was Alexander Downer who was John Brennan's CIA counterpart at one point in time for Australia that supposedly had this random conversation with George Papadopoulos that served as the predicate.""

Investigating the Russia investigation

Gowdy helped elevate Ratcliffe into his role on the GOP-led investigation that was chaired by Gowdy and then-Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte. A handful of lawmakers were part of a task force Gowdy and Goodlatte created that took the lead on questioning witnesses, which included Ratcliffe and close Trump ally Rep. Mark Meadows of North Carolina.

In the role, Ratcliffe questioned multiple witnesses who appeared behind closed doors before the committee in 2018, including former FBI Director James Comey, Papadopoulos and Peter Strzok and Lisa Page , the FBI officials who exchanged anti-Trump text messages that have fueled accusations that Mueller's probe was inherently biased.

""We have learned in the course of this investigation of incredible manifest bias from people like Peter Strzok and Lisa Page,"" Ratcliffe said in one contentious exchange with Comey. ""I'm trying to determine the level of bias, if any, that Director Comey had with respect to President-elect or President Trump and why he would have violated his employment agreement to share information, classified or unclassified, with individuals who were not authorized to receive it.""

When Strzok appeared before the panels in June 2018, Ratcliffe pushed him on whether Mueller's team had asked if the texts reflected bias, a point that Republicans hammered home when he appeared publicly the following month.

""So did Special Counsel Mueller or anyone with the special counsel investigative team make any inquiry as to whether or not any bias or prejudice reflected in that text that I just referred to impacted any actions or decisions or the manner in which the evidence you gathered, that information was affected?"" Ratcliffe asked.

""So, if you're asking whether or not any -- if any of my personal beliefs ever influenced any official action, the answer to that is never,"" Strzok responded.

""I'm not asking that question,"" Ratcliffe responded. ""I'm asking you whether the special counsel or anyone with the special counsel's investigative team made inquiry to you, whether or not any bias or prejudice that would be reflected in the text 'F Trump' impacted any actions that you took, any decisions you made, any information or evidence that you gathered?""

Ratcliffe was pitched for attorney general

Ratcliffe's sharp questioning of Mueller last week may have put the Texas Republican over the edge to become Trump's choice for the director of national intelligence, but Ratcliffe was a known commodity at the White House well before the special counsel probe concluded.

Gowdy, who considers Ratcliffe a close friend and has stayed in touch after leaving Congress, helped get the Texas Republican on Trump's radar last year for a different administration job: attorney general.

Gowdy said in an interview that he tried to set up a meeting with Trump to pitch Ratcliffe for the role after Jeff Sessions was fired in November 2018, but the meeting was delayed and Barr had already been selected.

Trump still met with Gowdy, which was Gowdy's first direct interaction with the President, giving him the chance to talk up Ratcliffe as a great candidate, Gowdy said.

Gowdy wasn't the only one pitching Ratcliffe. He was also floated by Fox News' Gregg Jarrett and former Rep. Jason Chaffetz on Fox News' ""Hannity"" the day that Sessions was ousted.

""By the way, I agree with Gregg, I hope that President Trump appoints John Ratcliffe, I think he is best person to do that,"" Chaffetz said.

A Fox News regular

Ratcliffe's role on the GOP-led investigation into the FBI and Justice Department made him a Fox News regular over the past two years.

In his interviews, Ratcliffe accused the Obama administration FBI and Justice Department of abusing the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act when it obtained a warrant on former Trump adviser Carter Page . He supported the release of the classified memo from then-House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes and joined the Republican calls for a second special counsel.

Ratcliffe charged the anti-Trump texts sent by Strzok, who was removed from Mueller's team over the messages, had poisoned the evidence that the special counsel might collect.

""I like the policy of extending clearances to former intelligence and law enforcement officials for the purpose of being able to provide advice and counsel to their successors, successive administrations, including the President,"" Ratcliffe told Bartiromo in August 2018. ""I agree with the privilege. I also agree with revoking the privilege when it's been abused. So, in John Brennan's case, I think it's appropriate.""

Since the special counsel's report was released, Ratcliffe has criticized House Democrats for continuing to claim evidence of collusion when Mueller did not establish a criminal conspiracy. But Ratcliffe was prescient nearly a year ago over the current political battle playing out in Congress -- an environment he would leave should he be confirmed as director of national intelligence.

""At the end of the day, where we are headed here is no charges for collusion or obstruction with anyone associated with the Trump campaign,"" he told Bartiromo on October 14, 2018. ""But a report from Bob Mueller outlining perhaps some questionable conduct, and we will be left arguing with our Democratic colleagues whether that rises to an impeachable offense, even if it's not criminal in nature."""
EPA proposal scraps limits on coal plant waste,https://thehill.com,[],07-30-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/455386-epa-proposal-scraps-limits-on-coal-plant-waste,"The Trump administration on Wednesday proposed scrapping restrictions on arsenic-laden waste from coal-fired power plants.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed lifting some regulations on coal ash, the residue left after burning coal, which is filled with hazardous substances that can leach into the water supply and cause health problems.

ADVERTISEMENT

“I can say without hesitation that this is an extremely dangerous proposal that will do lasting harm to communities near coal ash reuse sites and coal ash waste piles,” said Lisa Evans, senior counsel with Earthjustice.

Coal ash is used in a variety of ways, largely as a replacement for soil. It can be used to create level ground for construction projects or sprinkled over landfills as a protective cover.

But coal ash has been deemed responsible for contaminating water with arsenic, which is linked with some types of cancer.

The latest proposal from the EPA would eliminate restrictions from 2015 that limited coal ash use to 12,400 tons per site.

The Trump administration proposal would allow projects to use as much coal ash as they want but would have to file a demonstration that shows the project won’t cause harm if it’s close to certain features like groundwater or wetlands.

But Evans said that’s not a realistic safeguard.

“That demonstration doesn’t have to be defended to any regulatory agency or be posted for public notice or be written by any engineer or environmental professional,” Evans said. “You’ve got a fairly meaningless demo having to be created.”

The EPA said the regulations would help spur “beneficial use” — the term for new uses for what would otherwise be industry waste.

“Today the Agency is proposing sensible changes that will improve the coal ash regulations and continue to encourage appropriate beneficial use,” EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler Andrew WheelerOvernight Energy: Trump EPA looks to change air pollution permit process | GOP senators propose easing Obama water rule | Green group sues EPA over lead dust rules EPA proposes easing air pollution permitting process Green group sues EPA over lead dust rules it says are too lax MORE said in a statement. “These proposed changes will further responsible management of coal ash while protecting human health and the environment.”

The proposal includes some features that would make reporting requirements more accessible to the public, but environmentalists ultimately see the move as a bow to industry.

“Despite compelling and damning scientific evidence highlighting the harm to groundwater from coal ash, and court victories by community groups requiring the EPA to strengthen the 2015 rule, Wheeler is giving this gift to his former employers at the cost of public health,” Earthjustice and the Sierra Club said in a statement. “It is a disgrace to everything the EPA stands for, and we will do everything in our power to stop it.”"

(CNN) In another time, the President of the United States might have called an urgent press conference on Monday morning -- making sure he could command the world's attention -- and issued a stern warning that violent repression of peaceful protesters is intolerable.

After all, what we saw this weekend in Moscow and Hong Kong were alarming signs that a wave of more brutal repression is looming. The regimes in Moscow and Beijing have sent notice that they are about to crush peaceful, popular movements. This should alarm the US president and produce an urgent response.

Instead, President Donald Trump woke up Monday morning prepared to stoke racist sentiment across the United States, tweeting a new barrage of inflammatory messages against prominent African American figures in what has become a familiar pattern : racist tweets from the President, widespread condemnation by the public, doubling down by the President. Trump is making racism his trademark, spending his time energizing racists while decisively removing America from the moral high ground.

Perhaps not coincidentally, this is happening at the time when democracy activists most desperately need a show of support. They could use a strong statement from Washington telling the leaders in Russia and China that the world is watching. That their actions could have consequences. That, at the very least, their position on the global stage is teetering. That the American people stand on the side of those demanding justice.

Consider what happened in Russia, where pro-democracy activists have been protesting for the right to vote after authorities brazenly disqualified opposition candidates for an upcoming municipal election. President Vladimir Putin's approval has been sliding, discontent growing, and the largest protests in years have taken place, even though Russian law now makes it nearly impossible to obtain a protest permit.

This weekend, police sent rows of menacing riot police to break down a peaceful protest, arresting more than a thousand people in Moscow.

Most alarming is what happened to opposition leader Alexei Navalny, whose very life may well depend on whether the rest of the world makes it clear to the Kremlin that, if he is killed, there will be consequences.

Navalny was arrested earlier in the week after calling for a demonstration. Then, suddenly, on Sunday, he was rushed to a hospital with what the hospital called an ""acute allergic reaction."" He does not suffer from allergies. The news immediately brought to mind the fate of other Kremlin critics who have faced, shall we call it, biochemical issues.

Recall the horrific disfigurement of former Ukraine President Viktor Yushchenko, the Ukrainian politician who dared to challenge Putin's preferred candidate in 2004. He narrowly escaped death after being poisoned with dioxin. He believes the Kremlin was behind the assassination attempt.

The Kremlin stands accused of poisoning other Putin critics, even exiled ones, including Alexander Litvinenko, who died from radioactive polonium poisoning blamed on Putin by a UK inquest, and Sergei Skripal and his daughter, poisoned in Salisbury, England. British authorities have accused two Russian men of carrying out the hit, saying they belong to Russian military intelligence. The men say they were simply tourists visiting Salisbury.

Other Kremlin critics have died mysterious deaths. The popular politician and Putin critic Boris Nemtsov, shot in front of the Kremlin, former ally Boris Berezovsky, who supposedly killed himself, and many, many courageous journalists. The Committee to Protect Journalists counts 28 Russian journalists killed since 2000, the year Putin rose to power.

Navalny's personal doctor says he has been taken back out of the hospital into prison against her advice. She thinks he has been poisoned. Perhaps it was a warning, perhaps an attempt on his life. Navalny, back in prison on Monday, suggested he may have been poisoned while in police custody.

A well-articulated warning from Washington might just save him and others.

A warning to Beijing is just as urgent. For weeks the people of Hong Kong have waged peaceful protests against a government that is supposed to be independent of China under the ""one country, two systems"" model agreed when the territory reverted to China from the UK.

Protests started against a bill that would have allowed extradition to China, where the legal system is beholden to the Communist Party-controlled regime. The protests have been massive, bringing out as many as two million people in a territory of just seven million, underscoring how widespread and intense the distrust of China is.

Beijing has been growing impatient, and the signs are nothing short of ominous.

Last week, the spokesman for the Chinese military, Wu Qian, issued a chilling reminder that China's military forces could be quickly deployed inside Hong Kong if the territory's authorities request it. Then he described the protests in a way that made very clear Beijing is running out of patience. The protesters' behavior, Wu declared, ""is intolerable.""

That was Wednesday. On Sunday, Hong Kong police clad in riot gear launched a harsh crackdown against demonstrators. CNN's Anna Coren, in the midst of the mayhem , was visibly horrified. The protesters were completely peaceful, she said.

On Monday, China issued its sternest warning yet, accusing pro-democracy protesters of committing "" evil and criminal acts .""

One shudders to think what might come next at the hands of the regime that massacred protesters at Tiananmen Square 30 years ago.

When the tanks rolled in Tiananmen, then-President George H.W. Bush wasted no time publicly condemning the regime, as have other American presidents who spoke firmly and decisively against repression.

Sure, America has failed many times, and its own history is far from immaculate, but the words of a credible American president can help draw the moral lines. It may or may not stay the hand of a tyrant, it may or may not prevent a massacre. But at the very least it helps clarify what is and is not legitimate conduct in our time. Even if it fails to stop a catastrophe in progress, it may give second thoughts to another tinpot tyrant watching from a distance.

How tragic for America and for the world that Washington today is dominated by a President who thinks nothing matters more than his personal fate and believes inciting racist hatreds at home tops the national agenda."
Housing Authority Initiates Nearly $500 Million in Affordable Housing Developments,https://therivardreport.com,"['Iris Dimmick', 'More Iris']",,,,https://therivardreport.com/housing-authority-initiates-nearly-500-million-in-affordable-housing-developments/,"The San Antonio Housing Authority’s board approved on Thursday future transactions, tax credits, and bond applications that will be part of $486 million in affordable housing projects.

The nearly unanimous approval marks one of the largest amounts of financing authorized in a single day, said SAHA President and CEO David Nisivoccia. The funding will assist 14 different projects (nearly 3,500 housing units) across Bexar County that will have a portion reserved for residents who earn less than the area median income (AMI), ranging from 30 to 80 percent of AMI. These projects could come open in two to five years.

“This is not a normal Thursday,” Nisivoccia told the Rivard Report. “It’s a seminal day for the agency. I think staff here at San Antonio Housing Authority heard an action call; we heard that from the [Mayor’s Housing Policy] Task Force, the mayor, my board, and more importantly the residents of San Antonio saying, ‘Hey, we need more affordable housing.'”

City Council approved a policy framework last year, produced by the task force, that calls for increased spending and better procedures surrounding the affordable housing market.

Several of the items approved on Thursday have been years in the making, Nisivoccia said. “It’s not like it happened overnight. A lot of people might ask [what did SAHA do] for the last two years. Well, this is what we’ve been doing.”

Gone are the days of large, so-called “housing projects” that place low-income families in apartment buildings en masse, he said. The current model is to work with an affordable housing developer on public-private partnerships that have a mix of market-rate and subsidized units, and “I think you’re going to see more of it. … The market is good.”

Most of the projects will still need to come before the board again for final approval, including the tax credits and tax-exempt bond applications.

These are in preliminary stages, said Timothy Alcott, SAHA real estate and legal services officer, but the deadline to apply for those through the State is Aug. 15. These “volume caps” are first-come, first-serve.

These projects are just coming to fruition at the same time, Alcott said, hence the meeting’s large price tag. “We’re getting more players in and [that] gives us the ability to do more affordable units.”

SAHA is seeking volume caps for Alazán Courts (adjacent to the Alazán Lofts project in the West Side), 1604 Flats, Old Pearsall Flats, Traders Flats, Kitty Hawk Flats, and Mira Vista Apartments. SAHA has yet to identify partners for some of those projects, such as Alazán Courts.

The board also gave the go-ahead to pursue proposals from four companies to build seven different projects:

The Lynd Co. wants to construct Culebra Crossing, a $47 million 325-unit apartment complex near Loop 1604;

ARDC Ruiz proposes a $21 million, 102-unit that will rent almost exclusively to families earning 60 percent of AMI;

Real estate developer JMJ wants a one of two 24-story towers near La Villita on South St. Mary’s Street to include affordable units;

Weal Development proposes a $65 million, eight-story, 252-unit apartment complex at South St. Mary’s Street and East Nueva Street. Half of the units in the St. John Square project will be for families earning 50 percent of AMI;

Vesta Corp. is seeking to acquire three existing low-income housing projects in the South and Southwest sides;

SAHA also is pursuing $20 million in bonds to develop Charity at Springview Apartments. Charity, a working title, is a 250-unit project on the East Side.

Alcott and Nisivoccia said they were confident that almost all – if not all – projects initiated Thursday would come to fruition.

SAHA Commissioner Sofia Lopez cast the lone vote against the deals related to St. Mary’s Towers and Culebra Commons.

In the case of Culebra, Lopez said 80 percent of AMI isn’t affordable enough for many San Antonians. In both cases, Lopez said she wanted more details about the cost-benefit analysis and how such projects fit into the broader picture of housing stock in San Antonio.

She wants to make sure “we really are getting the best bang for our buck,” Lopez said.

Board Chair Jessica Weaver agreed that the board needs a kind of “retreat” in which staff provides an overview of SAHA’s strategies.

“Staff stands ready to have that retreat at any time,” Nisivoccia said.

Several residents spoke out about Alazán Lofts, a SAHA-NRP Group project that recently received a competitive 9 percent tax credit from the Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs. Forty-eight of the 88 units will be public housing, eight will be market-rate apartments, and the rest will be allocated for renters making 60 percent of AMI.

To build the four-story complex, however, requires a change in zoning. The area community plan calls for two-story homes there. City Council is slated to consider the zoning change Aug. 22. The Zoning Commission recommended approval this month.

“It’s not OK to dismiss community members,” Yaneth Flores, a West Side community organizer with the Esperanza Peace and Justice Center, said during the public comment period of the meeting.

Stephanie Marquez / Rivard Report

Alazán Lofts is a separate project from Alazán Courts. The latter is a proposal to demolish the oldest public housing project in the United States and build a more modern facility with 328 units.

“Demolition of this development would be disastrous for this community,” Flores said, because it would separate residents from their support network.

Those residents would have first dibs on temporary units elsewhere while construction proceeds at Alazán Courts, Nisivoccia said after the meeting, and have the option of moving back once completed.

The proposal would allow SAHA to update the facility and provide more of the “deep-dive” subsidies for those making less than half of AMI, he said. “That’s how I want to honor the past, is to provide people presently the opportunity to see a good life for themselves and most importantly their children.”

Trump Pick to Oversee Federal Lands Doesn’t Want the Government to Have Any,http://nymag.com,['Matt Stieb'],07-31-2019,2019,7,http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/07/trump-pick-to-oversee-federal-lands-doesnt-want-any.html,"A ridge in Bears Ears National Monument, which the Trump administration reduced by 201,876 acres. Photo: George Frey/Getty Images

With around 640 million acres in the bank, the federal government controls about 28 percent of the land in these United States, with the bulk of that lying in the West: Over half the ground in Nevada, Utah, Idaho, Alaska, and Oregon is under federal oversight. But the president’s new appointee for Bureau of Land Management, the office that oversees most of that property, isn’t too keen on the government’s role in managing land.

Earlier this week, Interior Secretary David Bernhardt made Wyoming native, attorney, and Reagan administration alum William Perry Pendley the acting director of the BLM. Since serving in the Gipper’s Energy and Interior departments, Pendley has sued Interior on behalf of an oil prospector, tried to slash protections for endangered species — including cutting laws protecting grizzly bears in national parks — and attempted to make it easier to build on federal land.

In addition to his political view on public lands — in 2016, he wrote in the National Review that “[t]he Founding Fathers intended all lands owned by the federal government to be sold” — Pendley has some personal relationships that add concerns to his nomination. The Washington Post explains:

Pendley’s legal ties, as well as his policy positions, have attracted scrutiny. Environmental groups are pressing Interior to formally recuse Pendley from any involvement in a court case in which he is still the counsel of record representing an aging businessman, Sidney Longwell and his small company Solenex.

Solenex purchased a 6,247-acre lease in northwest Montana in 1982 during the Reagan administration for about $1 an acre. Longwell wants permission to build a six-mile service road and bridge over the Two Medicine River on lands considered sacred by the Blackfeet Tribe. Interior wants to cancel the lease. He would use the road to bring in drilling rigs and other oil exploration equipment.

“The Department’s career ethics professionals are working closely with Mr. Pendley and will advise him as necessary,” an Interior official said.

Pendley has also blasted former Interior secretary Ryan Zinke for not doing enough to open up public lands to private development. In another article for the National Review published in 2017, Pendley criticized Zinke for not reducing national monuments at the rate he deemed necessary: “Instead of doing as asked [by the Trump administration], Secretary Zinke recommended decreasing the size of only four of the most blatantly illegal national monuments while leaving the boundaries of all the others standing with mollycoddle language, which will soon get stricken by environmentalists.” That Zinke reduced only two national monuments wasn’t enough: Pendley rejected that Zinke proposed to make the Badger-Two Medicine preserve in Montana a national monument, an area Solenex wanted to explore for drilling.

Earlier this week, President Trump nominated John Ratcliffe to become the new director of National Intelligence, despite Ratcliffe’s consistent doubt in the efficacy of the intelligence community’s findings on Russia. That the administration has proposed another nominee to deregulate and dismantle the department he runs should now be expected as the norm."
DHS issues hacking security alert for small planes,https://www.cbsnews.com,['Kris Van Cleave'],07-30-2019,2019,7,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/dhs-issues-hacking-security-alert-small-planes-today-2019-07-30/,"Washington — The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) issued a rare security alert Tuesday for small planes. The alert warns if a hacker gained physical access to certain small planes, they could attach a common device to its wiring. This could provide false flight data including altitude and airspeed, as well as possible access to the autopilot system, potentially leaving a pilot unable to tell whether the reading was accurate and potentially lose control of the aircraft.

""We could do basically anything the plane can do, pretty much anything the pilot could do by himself,"" said Tod Beardsley, director of research at cyber security firm Rapid7.

In a laboratory setting, researchers at Rapid7 were able to hack what's essentially a plane's electronic central nervous system, allowing them to send the erroneous commands. ""I do think it is something of a wake up call. This is something that needs to be taken seriously now rather than later, like after the disaster,"" Beardsley said.

Last year, Homeland Security researchers, who successfully hacked a 757 while it was parked, warned it's only ""a matter of time before a cybersecurity breach on an airline occurs."" DHS is now urging small plane makers to study the cyber security protections car makers added after hackers were able to exploit similar technology on the roads.

The Federal Aviation Administration tells CBS News a ""scenario that involves unrestricted physical access is unlikely"" but these findings are ""an important reminder to remain vigilant."" Rapid7 said it notified the company that built those two systems, but their findings prompted DHS to urge pilots to secure their aircraft and for manufacturers to take a look at options to better secure these systems."
Trump EPA yanks Obama-era proposal to restrict mine development in salmon-rich Bristol Bay region,https://www.seattletimes.com,"['Hal Bernton', 'Seattle Times Staff Reporter']",07-30-2019,2019,7,https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/environment/trump-administration-scuttles-epa-proposal-to-restrict-alaska-mine-development-in-bristol-bay-region/,"The Environmental Protection Agency scuttled proposed development restrictions Tuesday on an open-pit mine in the headwaters of Alaska’s Bristol Bay region, which sustains the largest sockeye salmon runs in the world.

The move by Chris Hladick, the EPA’s Seattle-based regional administrator, is part of a broader Trump administration push to proceed with a permitting review for the Pebble Mine, a world-class deposit of gold, molybdenum and copper that — due to its sensitive location — is among the most contested mineral-development projects in Alaska history.

The proposed restrictions date to the Obama administration, and would have sharply limited the amount of wetlands and salmon streams that could have been damaged by disposal of mine wastes. The developer’s CEO — Tom Collier of Pebble Partnership — hailed the EPA action Tuesday as removing a “cloud of uncertainty” by reversing “outrageous federal government overreach.”

“The restrictions would have precluded any meaningful mineral development in the region — period,” said Collier, who credited Alaska Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy with encouraging the EPA to abandon the proposal.

The Army Corps of Engineers is now undertaking a permitting review scheduled to be completed next year. State permitting would take another few years, which could enable the mine to begin producing ore by 2026, according to Collier.

The EPA action brought a bitter response from a wide-ranging coalition of passionate opponents that includes commercial fishermen from Washington and elsewhere that join in the summer sockeye harvests, sport anglers, seafood processors, recreation companies, Native groups and environmentalists.

“This comes as we are wrapping up the second largest-recorded salmon harvest in Bristol Bay of 42 million salmon and counting, to feed not only our people but the world. Our people will continue to do whatever it takes to stop this mine,” said Alannah Hurley, executive director of the United Tribes of Bristol Bay.

Pebble was first proposed more than a decade ago, and Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Washington, a longtime critic of the mine, on Tuesday accused the EPA of a “reckless action” that would threaten the Bristol Bay watershed and the fisheries and maritime economy it supports.

During the Obama administration, the EPA undertook a major review of the mine’s environmental impacts in response to a 2011 request from six Bristol Bay tribes. In 2014, the Seattle regional office used the authority vested by the Clean Water Act to propose tight restrictions that included a cap of 1,100 acres of wetlands, lakes and ponds that could be lost to development and the loss of no more than 5 miles of streams used by salmon or other seagoing fish.

“In simple terms, the infrastructure necessary to mine the Pebble deposit jeopardizes the long-term health and sustainability of the Bristol Bay ecosystem,” said the 2014 document released by the EPA’s Seattle regional office.

Northern Dynasty, the Canadian company that owns Pebble Partnership, contested the EPA’s 2014 finding in a lawsuit settled during the first year of the Trump administration, and allowed the project to proceed with federal permitting. The EPA action Tuesday rescinds the 2014 findings, which Dennis McLerran, who served as the agency’s Seattle-based regional administrator during the Obama administration, said were based on the best available science.

“What is happening now is the decision-making process is being politicized and removed from the science,” McLerran said in a Tuesday interview.

The permits likely will face legal challenges.

“I think litigation is inevitable,” said Taryn Kiekow Heimer, a senior advocate at the Natural Resources Defense Council, which opposes the Pebble Mine."

Computing—“Seeing” in real time

Oak Ridge National Laboratory is training next-generation cameras called dynamic vision sensors, or DVS, to interpret live information—a capability that has applications in robotics and could improve autonomous vehicle sensing. Unlike a traditional digital camera that records large amounts of information in frames, a DVS transmits per-pixel changes in light intensity. Individual pixel locations are recorded and time stamped to the microsecond, creating data “events” that are processed by a neuromorphic network—a type of intelligent, energy-efficient computing architecture. “Because the DVS records only changes in what it sees, there is no redundant data,” said ORNL SULI intern Kemal Fidan, who spent his summer learning about dynamic vision sensors under ORNL’s Robert Patton. This capability makes the sensors fast, power efficient and effective in wide ranges of light intensity.

Fusion—Tungsten rising

Using additive manufacturing, scientists experimenting with tungsten at Oak Ridge National Laboratory hope to unlock new potential of the high-performance heat-transferring material used to protect components from the plasma inside a fusion reactor. Fusion requires hydrogen isotopes to reach millions of degrees. Tungsten, the metal with the highest melting point, holds promise to withstand extreme temperatures at the edge of this reaction, yet it is brittle and difficult to machine. The ORNL team is using an additive manufacturing technique called electron beam melting to build innovative tungsten fusion components with complex, unique geometries that can’t be made through traditional manufacturing. “The electron beam allows us to better control the heat distribution as tungsten is printed layer by layer,” said ORNL’s Betsy Ellis who led the initial experiments. “After more testing, this method may result in a better quality, full-density structure that’s less prone to cracking.” [Contact: Sara Shoemaker, (865) 576-9219; shoemakerms@ornl.gov]

Climate—Energy demand shuffle

A detailed study by Oak Ridge National Laboratory estimated how much more—or less—energy United States residents might consume by 2050 relative to predicted shifts in seasonal weather patterns across the country. ORNL’s Deeksha Rastogi and colleagues used a series of sophisticated climate models run on supercomputing resources at ORNL to estimate changes in household energy demand over a 40-year period. They found that prolonged periods of increased temperatures are expected to drive a rise in electricity needs while shorter, milder cold seasons could reduce natural gas demand. The team’s paper also posits that climate shifts could impact a projected decrease in residential energy demand in some rural areas. “Our results provide a highly comprehensive look at residential energy consumption that we hope will influence future analysis to understand residents’ choices and behavior relative to climate and socioeconomic conditions,” Rastogi said.

Supercomputing—Galactic winds demystified

Using the Titan supercomputer at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, a team of astrophysicists created a set of galactic wind simulations of the highest resolution ever performed. The simulations will allow researchers to gather and interpret more accurate, detailed data that elucidates how galactic winds affect the formation and evolution of galaxies. Brant Robertson of the University of California, Santa Cruz, and Evan Schneider of Princeton University developed the simulation suite to better understand galactic winds—outflows of gas released by supernova explosions—which could help explain variations in their density and temperature distributions. The improved set of galactic wind simulations will be incorporated into larger cosmological simulations. “We now have a much clearer idea of how the high speed, high temperature gas produced by clusters of supernovae is ejected after mixing with the cooler, denser gas in the disk of the galaxy,” Schneider said. —Elizabeth Rosenthal [Contact: Katie Bethea, (865) 576-8039; betheakl@ornl.gov]

Clean water—Sunny desalination

A new method developed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory improves the energy efficiency of a desalination process known as solar-thermal evaporation. Scientists fashioned tubular devices using nanoengineered graphite foam coated with carbon nanoparticles and a superhydrophobic material that increased the absorption of light energy directly from the sun. The thermal energy was used to heat seawater, producing freshwater vapor that was fed into a condenser to make potable water. The system removed more than 99.5% of salt in simulated seawater and reached 64% solar-thermal conversion efficiency. “Using this improved solar-absorbing material for interfacial water evaporation represents a more efficient use of solar energy,” said ORNL’s Gyoung Jang. The experiment is detailed in the journal Global Challenges. The method can be scaled up into modular systems to provide clean water at remote locations or to serve communities affected by hurricanes or floods.

The Justice Department is investigating whether former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke used personal email accounts for official business, a matter that has become part of a larger criminal probe into the departed official, according to a letter released by House Democrats on Tuesday.

The letter is the first public confirmation of a criminal investigation into Zinke, a former Republican congressman from Montana who faced scrutiny about his mixing of official, personal and political business while in President Donald Trump’s Cabinet.

Story Continued Below

The Interior Department's acting inspector general, Gail Ennis, told the lawmakers that the email investigation has been combined with an ongoing probe the IG is conducting with DOJ. That larger probe includes Zinke's participation in a land deal with the chairman of Halliburton, as well as Interior's obstruction of a tribal casino project in Connecticut following extensive lobbying by a rival casino company, both issues that were first reported by POLITICO.

House Natural Resources Chairman Raúl Grijalva and Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings requested the email investigation in April 2018, when both were ranking members of their respective panels.

""Last year, the OIG began investigating the matter you presented contemporaneous to a related criminal investigation that we are coordinating with the Department of Justice,"" Ennis wrote to Cummings and Grijalva in her July 29 letter. ""In consultation with DOJ and to avoid any interference with the criminal case, we have decided to combine the investigations. When we write our final report of investigation, we will include information that addresses the issues raised in your letter.""

Zinke, who resigned in December, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. DOJ declined to comment.

Grijalva and Cummings welcomed the DOJ probe.

""This investigation and others like it are part of restoring public trust in government, which has suffered from the intentional destruction of the Trump years,"" Grijalva said in a statement. ""Leaving office half a step ahead of the law doesn’t wipe the slate clean. It’s imperative that political appointees at the Department of Justice allow this investigation to continue unimpeded regardless of the risk to Mr. Zinke or other Trump officials.""

Border Patrol tried to fire him for lying about gun incident. Now he's Trump’s DHS spokesman,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-29-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/border-patrol-tried-to-fire-him-for-making-stuff-up-now-he-is-the-dhs-spokesman,"The top Homeland Security spokesman, brought in to serve last month by acting Secretary Kevin McAleenan, is a former Border Patrol agent whom U.S. Customs and Border Protection once attempted to fire for faking a crime against himself, according to three CBP officials with first-hand knowledge of the incident and a fourth who is also aware of it.

DHS acting Deputy Assistant Secretary of Media Operations Jose “Lu” Maheda was terminated by Border Patrol a year into his service during the 1990s. Since then, as one official put it, he has “failed up,” getting his job back and eventually becoming a regional Border Patrol spokesman. And now he is the top spokesman for the 240,000-person department because of his connection to McAleenan.

“The guy’s a proven liar and can’t testify in court and yet he’s a spokesman for DHS,” charged one CBP official who worked with Maheda at the time of the incident. “He is 100% a McAleenan sycophant.”

Under the 1972 Giglio v. United States decision, a witness whose integrity has been called into question cannot testify in court.

While working at the Border Patrol station in Nogales, Arizona during his first year on the job in 1996, Maheda left his loaded gun on the front seat of his work vehicle and set out on foot.

“While he was out — and unbeknownst to him — a supervisor came across the car and saw the” firearm, the official said. “He [Maheda] had failed to secure it, and it was just laying there, and that’s when the supervisor saw it and was like, ‘Oh my gosh, I’ve got to get this out of here.’ So the supervisor pulled the gun out. When Lu got back to the vehicle, he saw the shotgun was missing and didn’t realize the supervisor had taken it. So what he did was, he bust the window out, then went back and reported the shotgun stolen.”

A second official who worked with Maheda at the time confirmed the set of events, as did a third.

“He had a longarm go missing from his Border Patrol four-wheel drive so he busted the window out and made a notification that it was stolen, when it was in fact that an agent had just played a joke on him when he left his door unlocked,” said the third person, who also worked in Tucson at the time.

“There was no squirming out of that one. They had him dead to right,” the first official said.

Another source, a union official with secondhand knowledge of the incident, said the supervisor took the gun out of the vehicle to “safeguard” it, not as a joke. Maheda “broke the window and reported it was stolen,” he said.

While DHS does not comment on specific employee personnel actions, a DHS official provided the following information.

""Over 20 years ago, we can confirm that there was an allegation and subsequent full investigation,"" the official said. ""The employee was afforded due process and since then, the employee has had an exemplary record being promoted throughout the ranks without ill effect.""

Maheda was served termination paperwork a day after the incident. He fought the termination with the help of the National Border Patrol Council and kept his job on what the union official described as a “technicality” because he was issued a termination notice on the last day of routine year-long probation period.

The third official with first-hand knowledge of the incident said the move to provide him the termination paperwork the day after may have been intentional because it gave him a way to fight the decision, since the letter should have been served immediately.

“There were all these rumors that his brother, who was a BORTAC (Border Patrol Tactical Unit) agent that was very well thought of — that somebody may have been looking out for the family with that clerical mistake,” the official said.

At the time, Border Patrol agents in their first year could be fired for any reason without being able to appeal the decision or respond to the chief patrol agent’s concerns. A union representative at the time “argued that he was technically no longer on probation because his regular shift had ended before they fired him” and therefore the probation period was technically up, and was able to get an arbitrator to agree, according to the first CBP official. Maheda was reinstated and went to work for the union.

At a certain point in his career at DHS, Maheda began to have ""direct interface"" with McAleenan, who would eventually promote him to his current position.

The third official said Maheda was reprimanded during his work for the internal Border Patrol headquarters division during the 2000s for having “abused travel all over the country basically to install flat screen TVs.”

“He got transferred out of that branch during a bottom-up review that was done by the Border Patrol headquarters staff, led by then Operations Chief Kevin Oaks,” said this source said.

""The United States Border Patrol often conducts reviews and assessments of programs and personnel assignments. During Chief Kevin Oaks’ tenure, the United States Border Patrol restructured several programs and divisions within the Headquarters element, resulting reassignments of multiple personnel and program responsibilities,"" the DHS official said.

The first official described Maheda's promotions as ""one of those things you just keep scratching your head"" over.

“The Department is proud to include a member of the United States Border Patrol within the Department’s Office of Public Affairs,"" said Andrew Meehan, Acting Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs. ""Border Patrol agents have a unique and first-hand knowledge of the impact of the crisis on the southern border and continue to provide thoughtful guidance on how to communicate those challenges to the public.”"

Court documents allege that Emmit Marshall, 52, owner of the Alliance School of Trucking (AST), along with his co-defendant Robert Waggoner, 56, who served as the school’s director, recruited eligible veterans under the Post-9/11 GI Bill.



Marshall and Waggoner convinced veterans to enroll in their school by telling them “they could collect housing and other fees from the VA without attending the programs,” according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Central District of California.



Marshall told FreightWaves on July 31 that his trucking school is still open for business, but is no longer accepting veterans as students.



Knowing that the vast majority of veterans enrolled at AST did not intend to attend any portion of the programs the trucking school offered, which included a 160-hour Tractor Trailer and Safety class and a 600-hour Select Driver Development program, Marshall and Waggoner “created and submitted fraudulent enrollment certifications,” according to Marshall’s plea agreement.



Marshall and Waggoner also created student files that contained “bogus documents,” prosecutors allege.



Once AST became aware of the investigation, Marshall, Waggoner and others at the trucking school “removed fraudulent documents from student files, and Marshall later ordered that these files be destroyed,” Marshall’s plea agreement states.



Over a four-year period, court documents claim the VA paid AST approximately $2.3 million in tuition and fee payments for veterans who didn’t attend classes. The VA also paid around $1.9 million in educational benefits directly to veterans who did not attend classes at AST.



Marshall is scheduled to be sentenced on November 18. He faces a statutory maximum sentence of 100 years in federal prison. Waggoner, who has pleaded not guilty, is scheduled to go to trial on February 25, 2020.

Democratic senator vows to fight Trump Interior nominee after requesting perjury investigation,https://thehill.com,[],07-31-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/455519-dem-senator-vows-to-fight-trump-interior-nominee-after-requesting,"A Democratic senator is working to block a Trump nominee from serving as the top lawyer for the Department of the Interior and calling for an investigation after the nominee appeared to lie to lawmakers during his confirmation hearing about the department's public records policy.

Sen. Ron Wyden Ronald (Ron) Lee WydenOn The Money: Trump to hit China with new tariffs next month | Stocks plummet on latest trade threat | Senate sends budget deal to Trump | Judge orders NY not to share Trump's tax returns for now Top Democrat: 'Disqualifying' if Trump intel pick padded his résumé Dems push for review of Russian-backed project in Kentucky MORE (D-Ore.) is requesting a Department of Justice (DOJ) investigation into Daniel Jorjani, currently the top lawyer at Interior who was nominated to officially take over as solicitor for the department.

“Attempts by political appointees at the Interior Department to delay, stonewall and otherwise inhibit public and Congressional oversight are totally unacceptable,” Wyden said in a statement. “I cannot allow Mr. Jorjani’s nomination to proceed. I will object to any unanimous consent agreement to consider his nomination.”

Jorjani’s confirmation hearing was already a notable one, given that he was already connected to numerous issues being internally investigated by the Interior’s Office of the Inspector General.

The man nominated to lead that office, Mark Greenblatt, testified alongside Jorjani that day.

But during the hearing, senators became annoyed by Jorjani’s responses to their questions, particularly those that inquired about a new policy at Interior that allows political appointees to review public records requested through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).

Jorjani told lawmakers, “I myself don’t review FOIAs or make determinations.”

That comment has already spurred a request for an investigation from one environmental group, but Wyden’s letters asked both the Interior’s watchdog and the DOJ to investigate. They argue that cannot be true given Jorjani’s role overseeing FOIAs for the department.

Wyden, who pressed Jorjani for details on how the review process for political appointees works, say documents from the department show political appointees were given power “well beyond the written policy Mr. Jorjani cited.”

Interior said they believed Jorjani would still be confirmed.

""Dan Jorjani has a solid record of honorably serving the American people,"" spokeswoman Molly Block said in a statement to The Hill. ""The U.S. Department of the Interior is the only Department who has never had a Senate confirmed lawyer under the Trump Administration. Given this fact, we’re confident the Senate will prioritize the confirmation of this highly qualified individual who has been leading transparency efforts at the Department when they return in September.""

Jorjani is not just in hot water for his comments at the hearing but also for written responses he sent afterward, which repeatedly directed Wyden to get in touch with Interior’s congressional liaison for more information.

“I cannot a recall a nominee ever coming through this committee and responding to my requests for information by telling me to go ask somebody else,” Wyden said the day Jorjani was voted out of the Senate Natural Resources Committee.

All Democrats on the committee voted against Jorjani’s nomination.

“The solicitor must uphold the law above all else about, above party politics and ideology.

EPA says cleanup of arsenic-laced Minneapolis Superfund site is mostly complete,http://www.startribune.com,"['Greg Stanley', 'Greg.Stanley Startribune.Com']",,,,http://www.startribune.com/epa-says-cleanup-of-arsenic-laced-minneapolis-superfund-site-is-mostly-complete/513463092/,"After more than a decade of cleanup efforts and testing, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is ready to essentially shut down a Superfund site in south Minneapolis where industrial arsenic had contaminated the soil surrounding about 600 homes.

The East Phillips neighborhood site, near Hiawatha Avenue and E. 28th Street, has been on the EPA’s list of priorities under its Superfund program for years after extremely high arsenic levels were found in many of the yards surrounding an old rail line.

Remediation efforts have been almost entirely finished since 2011, when the EPA completed a $25 million project to dig up and replace most of the contaminated soil. A scheduled review conducted in April found that the soil poses no threat to humans or the environment and that it’s time to take the vast majority of the neighborhood off the priority list.

“The remedy is functioning as intended,” the review said.

The EPA plans to keep just nine properties on the cleanup list, where homeowners have refused to allow soil tests. The agency will continue conducting regular reviews until all nine are tested and remediated.

With the soil safe, there’s really no reason to keep the rest of the neighborhood on the list, said Cathy Villas-Horns, supervisor of the incident response unit for the Minnesota Department of Agriculture.

1930s-1960s: Arsenic blows in from a neighboring pesticide manufacturer. 2000s: EPA scientists find high arsenic levels in local soil, begin excavating and replacing it. 2011: EPA announces most yards have been cleaned up.

“Except for those nine properties, the cleanup has been completed,” Villas-Horns said.

Regulators believe that wind carried the arsenic into the neighborhood over the course of three decades from a site where the now-defunct Reade Manufacturing Co. had been storing, producing and dumping an arsenic-based insecticide from the 1930s until the 1960s.

In the early and mid-2000s, the EPA and Agriculture Department tested the soil of more than 3,500 houses, day-care centers and parks, as well as a cemetery in the area, finding unsafe levels of arsenic in more than 600 properties. By 2011, the two agencies had spent more than $25 million, largely from federal economic stimulus money, tearing out the yards and removing at least 1 foot of topsoil in each of the contaminated properties. They poured in clean topsoil and reseeded each lawn with grass.

There were roughly 30 holdouts in 2011 — properties where owners refused to grant permission to test their lawns. Over the past eight years, the EPA has whittled that number down to the nine who continue to deny permission.

Minnesota has 25 sites on the EPA Superfund priority list, which serves as a roster of contaminated areas that are eligible for federal cleanup funding. It primarily helps EPA managers decide where to focus limited funds. The site’s removal from the Superfund list “does not in any way alter EPA’s right to take enforcement actions, as appropriate,” the agency said in a statement.

If more contaminants are found, the EPA could place the area back on the list.

The state keeps its own list of cleanup priorities for the Superfund sites in Minnesota, including the former Reade Manufacturing property itself, at 2800 Hiawatha Av. The EPA decision will not affect the state’s ongoing groundwater cleanup and monitoring efforts at that property, which is a now a business center, Villas-Horns said.

Neighbors still worry

Some residents expressed concern Wednesday about potential consequences of taking the neighborhood off the Superfund list, saying the area is far from clean.

“If anything deserved the designation of a Superfund site, this neighborhood did and still does,” said Brad Pass of the East Phillips Improvement Coalition.

Properties in the area, such as the former Roof Depot immediately west of the Reade site, are slated for redevelopment, Pass said. But the building and asphalt parking lots may have been built on top of potentially polluted soil, trapping contaminants there for years.

Once those structures are torn down, Pass said, he’s worried there may be arsenic underneath that is once again blown into the neighborhood.

“Although they have remediated certain lots, this is going to open up tremendous potential for spreading this arsenic all over the place,” Pass said."
US Defense Department to Develop Blockchain Cybersecurity Shield,https://www.coindesk.com,[],07-29-2019,2019,7,https://www.coindesk.com/us-department-of-defense-is-developing-a-blockchain-cybersecurity-shield,"The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) is looking to forge a blockchain cybersecurity shield.

In a report published on July 12 titled Digital Modernization Strategy, the DoD outlined several ways to advance the nation’s digital defenses. This includes the integration of cloud and quantum computing, artificial intelligence, and improved communications through distributed ledgers.

In fact, DARPA, the research wing of the Department is already experimenting with the technology “to create a more efficient, robust, and secure platform,” to secure messaging and process transactions, reports Decrypt.

Specifically, blockchain may be deployed between units and headquarters as well as intelligence officers and the Pentagon. As part of the Digital Identity Management program, the agency may also issue a digital token that authenticates an agent’s identity.

The DoD is also experimenting with the technology to facilitate the creation of an unhackable code to secure its databases.

As part of the second Cryptographic Modernization program, in effect since 2000, the Department is replacing old hardware and cryptographic systems to meet the challenges of the improved computing power of the nation’s adversaries.

Citing the trustless, transparent, and immutable attributes of blockchain the Department writes:

“Blockchain networks not only reduce the probability of compromise, but also impose significantly greater costs on an adversary to achieve it.”

The shift from “low value to high-value work” is also part of the DoDs’ Big Data Platform (BDP), which will handle petabytes of data involved in a number of cross-agency projects. The platform “provides the ability to perform aggregation, correlation, historical trending,” and may perform pattern recognition to “predict attacks.”

A decision issued Monday by Attorney General William Barr will restrict the ability of migrants to claim asylum based on their family relations.

In a precedent-setting immigration court opinion, Barr said that simply being part of a nuclear family targeted for persecution doesn’t qualify as a “particular social group” eligible for asylum in the United States.

Story Continued Below

“The fact that a criminal group — such as a drug cartel, gang, or guerrilla force — targets a group of people does not, standing alone, transform those people into a particular social group,” the attorney general wrote.

President Donald Trump has sought to restrict access to asylum, which his administration views as a magnet that draws migrants north from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. Former Attorney General Jeff Sessionsissued a similar immigration court decision in June 2018 that blocked asylum for victims of domestic violence and gang violence, a move that drew condemnation from pro-migrant advocates. A federal judge based in Washington, D.C., blocked key parts of a policy related to the decision six months later.

Barr’s ruling will guide future decisions in the immigration courts, which are not part of the federal judiciary and fall under the purview of the Justice Department. Barr highlighted that authority in the ruling Monday, saying “the attorney general has primary responsibility for construing and applying provisions in the immigration laws.”

To receive asylum in the U.S., applicants must prove they faced persecution in their home countries based on race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership in a particular social group.

Barr’s decision Monday will limit the ability of a familial relationship to qualify as “membership in a particular social group.“ The number of asylum seekers who could be affected each year was not immediately clear.

The attorney general issued the decision in a case that involved a deported Mexican immigrant who claimed drug cartel members had targeted him because they wanted to sell drugs in his father’s Mexico City store.

The Board of Immigration Appeals found that the man’s relationship with his father qualified as a “particular social group,” but ultimately denied the asylum request because the man could not prove he was persecuted over the relationship.

Barr found that being part of a family meets the standard for asylum only when the family is “socially distinct in the eyes of its society.”

Immigration law advocates said the decision defied the precedents of at least two federal appeals courts, which have held that targeting based on family membership can qualify an immigrant for asylum.

“The family provides ‘a prototypical example of a particular social group,’” the Richmond-based 4th Circuitwrote in 2011, quoting an earlier case from the San Francisco-based 9th Circuit.

“It's a significant declaration of power from the A.G. and one that will hopefully take a beating in court,” Aaron Reichlin-Melnick of the American Immigration Council said on Twitter.

The DOJ asylum move is only the latest policy change to limit asylum.

Trump announced Friday that his administration had struck a deal with Guatemala that would require asylum seekers passing through that nation to first seek protections there.

The asylum agreement came after a San Francisco-based federal judge temporarily blocked a Trump regulation that barred asylum seekers who passed through other nations en route to the southwest border.
