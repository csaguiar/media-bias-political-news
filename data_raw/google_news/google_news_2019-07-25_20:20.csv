Lack of Electricity in Mueller Testimony Short-Circuits Impeachment,https://www.nytimes.com,['Carl Hulse'],07-25-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/25/us/politics/mueller-impeachment.html,"The reason some Republican support was critical was that Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has shown real reluctance to pursue impeachment, has consistently said that she would allow the House to take it up only if there was bipartisan sentiment to open an inquiry. “Bipartisan” in that sense doesn’t mean most Republicans would have to be on board, but at least a few public backers would be required to give a bipartisan veneer to the highly charged proceedings.

Absolutely none surfaced after the hearings.

The speaker made clear that she thought the best course for Democrats at the moment would be legal challenges to the president and his administration.

“My position has always been whatever decision we make in that regard would have to be done with our strongest possible hand, and we still have some outstanding matters in the courts,” Ms. Pelosi said after the back-to-back hearings. “It’s about the Congress, the Constitution and the courts. And we are fighting the president in the courts.”

Revelations of impeachable conduct in a legal proceeding could still be a game changer for Democrats if evidence surfaced that forced Ms. Pelosi’s hand and made a decision to impeach the president unavoidable. Mr. Mueller also made it clear in his bare-bones testimony that Mr. Trump had been “generally” untruthful with him and had committed other acts that no doubt would have led to congressional action against other presidents.

After all, the only elected president to be impeached, Mr. Clinton, was rung up by a House under control of the opposite party for lying under oath about sex, not about his campaign’s contacts with a hostile foreign power seeking to influence an election.

But the majority of House Democrats remain on the fence about impeachment — last week they split 137 to 95 against a symbolic impeachment vote. After the Mueller testimony, just one Democrat, Representative Lori Trahan of Massachusetts, immediately joined the call for at least beginning an impeachment inquiry, hardly the flood pro-impeachment lawmakers had hoped would be spurred by Mr. Mueller."
Trump Administration Considering 'Travel Ban' On Guatemalans After Asylum Snub,https://www.npr.org,['Franco Ordoñez'],07-25-2019,2019,7,https://www.npr.org/2019/07/25/745132775/trump-administration-considering-travel-ban-on-guatemalans-after-asylum-snub,"Trump Administration Considering 'Travel Ban' On Guatemalans After Asylum Snub

The Trump administration is actively investigating imposing a travel ban against Guatemala unless the Central American nation takes significant steps to curb illegal migration northward.

In a move reminiscent of the pressure campaign President Trump launched against Mexico over immigration, the travel ban is the most explosive option of three that the administration says it's considering against the Central American nation, according to White House and other U.S. sources familiar with the plans. Trump charged Guatemala with backing out on an immigration deal with the United States.

""If Guatemala doesn't take significant action to help protect our borders, then we will, of course, look at all manner of solutions to the serious crisis we face,"" a White House official told NPR, ""whether it's a travel ban, significant actions on remittances and/or tariffs.""

The White House is looking at the authority already granted to the executive branch to suspend the entry of classes of people when it's considered detrimental to national interests.

Trump said Wednesday that the United States was planning to take ""severe"" action against the government of Guatemala after, he said, it broke a deal with the United States to serve as a safe third party country.

One of Trump's strategies for reducing the number of people crossing the border is to get them to go through the asylum process outside of the United States. Guatemala was particularly important for that strategy; the deal would have obligated migrants who traveled through Guatemala to seek protection there instead of traveling to the U.S.

This month, Guatemala's high court blocked its government from signing the deal with the United States. Trump said he didn't believe that the court acted independently of the Guatemalan government and that the United States would take action.

""We're looking at something very severe with respect to Guatemala,"" Trump said Wednesday as he was leaving the White House on his way to a fundraiser in West Virginia.

The White House didn't share specific details of how the travel ban would be implemented, such as whether it would apply to all Guatemalans or only certain groups.

But officials are looking at the same powers to control the U.S. borders that Trump cited when he banned travel from several predominantly Muslim nations shortly after becoming president.

Under a provision of immigration law, Congress has given the president sweeping power to indefinitely block ""the entry of any class of aliens into the United States"" that he or she thinks would be ""detrimental to the interests of the United States.""

Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies for the Center for Immigration Studies, who speaks regularly with the administration, said the situation is ""long past out of control.""

""The president is frustrated that Congress and some lower court judges are blocking his efforts to address the border crisis, and his options are limited, so he is willing to push the envelope to get results,"" she said.

Targeting remittances

Trump made similar threats against Mexico if it didn't take greater steps to slow migration.

This spring, Trump threatened to impose new tariffs starting at 5% that would climb to 25% against Mexico if its government didn't stop the flow of migrants to the United States.

Trump abandoned the threat when, he said, Mexico agreed to strengthen patrols on the border.

The Guatemalan government did not immediately respond to questions about the possibility of a travel ban.

But Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales said in a statement that the government was aware of the possible measures that the Trump administration could take and blamed the country's court for damaging the ""good relationship"" the government has with the U.S.

""All this jeopardizes the bilateral relationship with the United States that will lead to possible sanctions,"" Morales said on social media.

A fee or tax on Guatemalan remittances could be devastating to the Guatemalan economy. Guatemalan nationals living abroad sent back $9.5 billion in 2018, making up 12% of the country's GDP, according to World Bank data. Most of that money comes from the United States.

It's not the first time Trump has floated the idea of targeting remittances. As a candidate, he promised that Mexico would pay for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border without equivocation or nuance and proposed a six-step plan.

""On day 2 Mexico will immediately protest,"" the campaign wrote in a two-page briefing. ""They receive approximately $24 billion a year in remittances from Mexican nationals working in the United States. The majority of that amount comes from illegal aliens.""

Legal challenges expected

Like the Trump administration's previous bans against several Muslim-majority nations, any action taken against Guatemala is likely to trigger a legal battle.

But that threat is unlikely to sway Trump. He reminded a group of conservative youths on Tuesday that his administration eventually won the nearly year-and-a-half-long legal fight over a revised version of that first travel ban in the Supreme Court.

""People don't realize we won the ban,"" Trump said Tuesday.

Leon Fresco, who served as deputy assistant attorney general for the Office of Immigration Litigation in the Obama administration, said the Trump administration is likely to face a greater legal challenge if it seeks to block Guatemalans conducting legitimate business in the United States.

""There will be lawsuits because the standard for a travel ban is that you have to show that the entry of law-abiding Guatemalans would be detrimental to the interest of the United States,"" Fresco said. ""And the president is not going to be able to show that law-abiding Guatemalans doing trade and commerce in the United States are in any way detrimental to the interest of the United States. There is no security threat of any kind from Guatemala toward the United States.""

The White House official emphasized that the Trump administration would simply use long-standing powers taken by many past administrations to block citizens of some countries from entering the United States.

In 1986, President Ronald Reagan imposed a ban on Cuban nationals and, in 1988, on certain Nicaraguan officials for the ""unjustified expulsion from Nicaragua of the United States Ambassador and seven other United States diplomats."" The Clinton and Obama administrations also blocked some foreign nationals from entering the U.S.

But immigration specialists, such as David Bier of the Cato Institute, argue that no president has used the provision on the same scale as Trump.

""No prior ban had ever targeted multiple nationalities at the same time,"" Bier told NPR. ""And only one earlier ban in 1986 had included an entire nationality and that one only did so for a few months. This would be a far broader use of the travel ban authority that we've seen by any prior president.""

U.S. sources familiar with the administration's plans to take action against Guatemala caution that nothing is final until Trump signs the paperwork. But they say the plans show Trump's comments were not just a mere threat after Guatemala backed out of the deal.

""It's not like a gleam in anyone's eyes. It's in the works,"" said a source familiar with details of some of the remittance plans. ""This is not just some random comment from Trump. It's a reflection of policies that they're looking to implement."""
"Automakers, Rejecting Trump Pollution Rule, Strike a Deal With California",https://www.nytimes.com,"['Coral Davenport', 'Hiroko Tabuchi']",07-25-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/25/climate/automakers-rejecting-trump-pollution-rule-strike-a-deal-with-california.html,"California, for its part, won the backing of four powerful companies in its showdown with the federal government. The Trump administration, in its new rules, is also expected to revoke California’s right to set its own auto emissions standards, and the state has vowed to fight that effort all the way to the Supreme Court if necessary. The four automakers, by siding with California, are in effect voting that they expect California to win that battle.

On Thursday, Gov. Gavin Newsom of California said he was “very confident” that more automakers would join the deal in coming days.

One auto executive familiar with the negotiations agreed that was likely.

On Thursday morning, a wider group of automakers held a meeting to consider joining the pact, the executive said, although there were no immediate sign-ons. Ford, Honda, BMW and Volkswagen decided to keep the group small, he said, because a wider group would have been more difficult to bring together, raising the prospect that word would get out and the deal would collapse.

Margo Oge, a former senior E.P.A. official who worked on auto emissions policy and now serves as an informal adviser to several auto companies, said, “I have been calling all these companies and telling them to cut a deal with California. I think G.M. and Toyota will also have the courage to sign on.”

Trump administration officials said the California deal would not stop their plans to put forward a new federal rule to allow more tailpipe pollution. The deal “has no impact on E.P.A.’s regulation of greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act,” wrote Michael Abboud, an E.P.A. spokesman, in an email. “This voluntary framework is a PR stunt that does nothing to further the one national standard that will provide certainty and relief for American consumers.”"

GOP leaders — with some help from President Donald Trump — are scrambling to round up Republican support for a two-year, $2.7 trillion budget deal as the House moves toward a vote on the package Thursday afternoon.

Top Republicans believe only a fraction of their conference will support the legislation, hammered out during weeks of negotiations between Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. GOP insiders estimate that as little as one-third of the 197-member GOP conference will back the measure, although the vote tally is still fluid.

Story Continued Below

With GOP leaders facing strong opposition from rank-and-file members over the package, Trump tweeted out his support for the legislation on Thursday morning.

""House Republicans should support the TWO YEAR BUDGET AGREEMENT which greatly helps our Military and our Vets. I am totally with you!,"" Trump said.

But House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) didn't sound optimistic that Trump's tweet would move many votes.

House Republicans should support the TWO YEAR BUDGET AGREEMENT which greatly helps our Military and our Vets. I am totally with you! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 25, 2019

""It helps,” Scalise said. But Scalise added, “We’ve heard from a lot of members who said they’re voting no, no matter what. But this helps with some of those members who are on the fence.”

When asked whether the majority of the GOP conference would get behind the budget deal, Scalise admitted, “I don’t think that was ever something realistic. But we’re working to build the numbers.”

To help whip up support, Scalise convened a conference call on Thursday morning with Trump and a number of GOP members who are still on the fence, according to a source who was on the call. During the call, Trump made a hard sell to Republicans, assuring them that he would remain supportive of the deal and vowing to back them up if they walked the plank.

One member who did announce her support for the agreement is GOP Conference Chairwoman Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.). Cheney had declined to say whether she backed the deal since it was announced earlier this week.

“I support the budget,"" Cheney said. ""It’s not a deal I would have done. It’s not a deal that we would do if we were in the majority. It shows you why elections matter. But the importance of being able to get a defense number, that is a sufficient number, is important.“

The Republican Study Committee and House Freedom Caucus — two major groups within the conference — both are opposed to the measure, which increases Pentagon and domestic spending by $320 billion over the budget caps while also suspending the debt ceiling until at least July 31, 2021.

“For too long, Congress has dodged its responsibility to provide fiscally sound solutions that will ensure the continued security and prosperity of our great nation,"" said Rep. Mike Johnson (R-La.), RSC chairman, and the RSC Steering Committee chairman. ""As the largest caucus of conservatives in Congress, it is the Republican Study Committee’s duty to insist upon better stewardship and to oppose irresponsible efforts to raise discretionary limits.""

On the Democratic side, Pelosi is personally lobbying her members to support the agreement, and she predicted it would pass.

""We're going to have a majority for the bill,"" Pelosi told reporters Thursday morning. ""We want it to be bipartisan.""

Outside pressure to support the deal is also intensifying, with the powerful Chamber of Commerce urging House lawmakers in a letter on Thursday to vote for the budget agreement and warning that the organization “will consider including votes on this legislation in our annual How They Voted scorecard.”

Progressives, concerned about inflating the Pentagon’s budget, are expected to rally around Pelosi. Their backing comes after a revolt earlier this year, when they rejected spending levels crafted by House Budget Chairman John Yarmuth (D-Ky.), and sought bigger increases for domestic programs and cuts to military spending.

The Congressional Progressive Caucus released a statement on Wednesday in support of the deal without guaranteeing votes for it.

“This deal does not address the bloated Pentagon budget, but it does begin to close the gap in funding for families, by allocating more new non-defense spending than defense spending for the first time in many years,” the lawmakers said.

Progressive support began to trickle out on Wednesday, with Reps. Mark Pocan (D-Wis.) and Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) declaring their support. Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) told POLITICO that she was “leaning” toward a “yes” vote.

“We’ve got to look for every leverage point that we have, but this is a critical one to get off the table for a whole host of reasons,” Jayapal said of the budget deal.

The two-year, $2.7 trillion package now earning halfhearted endorsements from progressives includes $5 billion more for the military in fiscal 2020 funding than what House Democrats like Yarmuth wanted to provide earlier this year, in addition to $15 billion less for domestic programs.

Under the deal, defense programs would see a 3 percent hike in fiscal 2020, topping off at $738 billion. Domestic programs would increase 4 percent over current levels to a total of $632 billion, which includes $2.5 billion for the 2020 census.

The agreement includes about $77 billion in offsets, which is far less than the $150 billion sought by the Trump administration. Those offsets are expected to kick in near the end of a decade, meaning they’ll likely never take effect.

Trump’s New Defense Secretary Embodies “the Swamp.” Congress Is Fine With That.,https://slate.com,['Joshua Keating'],07-25-2019,2019,7,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/07/mark-esper-defense-secretary-raytheon-lobbyist.html,"President Donald Trump and Defense Secretary Mark Esper with his wife Leah Esper in the Oval Office on Tuesday. Jabin Botsford/Washington Post via Getty Images

Compared with some of the other events taking place on Capitol Hill this week, Mark Esper’s confirmation as defense secretary on Tuesday was a largely drama-free affair: Esper, a former lobbyist for defense contractor Raytheon, sailed through with a 90–8 vote, ending the longest period without a confirmed secretary in the history of the Defense Department.

Esper is one of three acting secretaries who’ve served since Jim Mattis resigned in December, including Patrick Shanahan, who was initially nominated by President Donald Trump to take on the role permanently but withdrew from consideration in June amid revelations of domestic violence involving his ex-wife and son. At a time when the president is casually talking about killing 10 million people in Afghanistan, it makes sense that Esper was an uncontroversial nominee, but outside the Trumpian context, it’s still regrettable that he didn’t face a little more scrutiny. At this point, senators might have voted for anyone with a pulse to take over the Pentagon. Esper boasts not only a pulse but a résumé that includes fighting in the Army during the first Gulf War, extensive experience in defense policy, and a positively regarded tenure as secretary of the Army. The answers he gave during his written and public testimony to the Senate Armed Services Committee reveal very conventional defense establishment—as opposed to Trumpian—views: He believes in the value of U.S. alliances including NATO, views Russia as an adversary, and is wary of hasty troop withdrawals.

But as Edwin Djabatey and Kate Brannen of Just Security note, it’s astonishing that Esper did not face a single question about Afghanistan—America’s longest war—in his confirmation hearing. In his written testimony, he said that the withdrawal of troops from the conflict should be “conditions-based”—but we have very little idea from his testimony what those conditions might be. As Djabatey and Brannen also point out, Esper listed three objectives for the ongoing U.S. military mission in Syria: fighting the remnants of ISIS, reaching a political settlement for the Syrian civil war, and pushing for the withdrawal of Iranian troops from the conflict. The last two objectives were definitely never authorized by Congress. The first arguably isn’t either; U.S. troops were sent to Syria by the Obama administration under the auspices of the 2001 Authorization for the Use of Military Force, passed before ISIS even existed. (Esper opposes canceling or amending the authorization.)

Esper also supports keeping the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay open, and keeping active-duty troops on the southern U.S. border.

Then there’s the Raytheon issue. The contractor produces electronics for a wide array of U.S. combat systems. Esper spent seven years as the company’s top lobbyist in Washington. The most contentious moment of Esper’s confirmation hearing on July 16 came when Sen. Elizabeth Warren pressed him on his ties to his former company and refusal to pledge to recuse himself from any decisions affecting Raytheon’s business throughout his tenure in government. Esper said he could not do that based on the advice of department ethics advisers, though he did promise to recuse himself from discussions involving a proposed merger of Raytheon and another company. Warren wasn’t having it, noting that Shanahan had made such a pledge with regard to his former employer, Boeing, and telling Esper, “This smacks of corruption, plain and simple.”

With Esper’s confirmation, four Trump Cabinet departments will be led by former lobbyists. Despite Trump’s executive order requiring officials not to lobby the agencies where they once worked for five years after leaving government, ProPublica reported in February that at least 33 former officials have found their way around the pledge. The swamp is far from drained.

Armed Services Committee Chairman James Inhofe actually apologized to Esper for Warren’s questioning. Sen. Rick Scott joked, “I guess she just needed a moment for her presidential campaign.”

It is true that of the eight Democratic senators who voted against Esper’s confirmation, five—Warren, Cory Booker, Kirsten Gillibrand, Kamala Harris, and Amy Klobuchar—are running for president. Bernie Sanders did not vote.

Republicans would describe this as campaign grandstanding, but it is notable that none of the senators whose records will face the greatest public scrutiny in the coming year wants a vote for Esper on that record.

The problems with Esper may not rate high on the scale of Trump-era outrages. They’re not even new. Esper and Republican senators pointed out during the hearings that Barack Obama had also named officials with lobbyist backgrounds to senior Pentagon positions, including Deputy Defense Secretary Bill Lynn, another former Raytheon lobbyist. In both his views on military force and his career path, Esper demonstrates problems in Washington—and reasons for public frustration— that predated this administration."
"Justice Department won't bring charges against Attorney General William Barr, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross after contempt vote",https://www.cnbc.com,['Sunny Kim'],07-25-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/25/doj-wont-bring-charges-against-barr-ross-after-contempt-vote.html,"Attorney General William Barr discussing the counting of citizens in the country and the legal issues surrounding that effort, behind him stands Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross, in the Rose Garden at the White House.

The Justice Department will not bring charges against Attorney General William Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross after the House voted last week to hold them in criminal contempt.

The DOJ had not been expected to pursue charges against Barr, who oversees the department, or Ross.

""The Department of Justice's long-standing position is that we will not prosecute an official for contempt of Congress for declining to provide information subject to a presidential assertion of executive privilege,"" Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen said in a letter to Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi on Wednesday.

The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee had authorized subpoenas to the Justice and Commerce departments in April demanding information about the administration's attempt to put a citizenship question on the 2020 census.

Barr and Ross had refused to comply with the subpoenas, after Trump asserted executive privilege over the documents. The refusal to comply prompted the Oversight Committee to vote along party lines to hold the officials in contempt. That vote was sent to the entire Democrat-led House, which voted last month to hold the men in contempt.

After a defeat at the Supreme Court, Trump abandoned his fight to add the citizenship question to the census, opting instead to sign an executive order to collect citizenship information from government agencies.

Rosen contended in the letter that the Justice Department has ""consistently adhered to the position that 'the contempt of Congress statute was not intended to apply and could not constitutionally be applied to an Executive Branch official who asserts the President's claim of executive privilege.'""

He cited multiple examples of the department taking the same stance during the Bush and Obama administrations.

""The Department has determined that the responses by the Attorney General and the Secretary of Commerce to the subpoenas issued by the Committee on Oversight and Reform did not constitute a crime,"" Rosen wrote.

A spokeswoman for the Oversight Committee did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment."

The United States Department of Justice (DoJ) announced the indictment in a press release on July 24.

According to the DoJ, the indictment filings and court statements indicate that Green operated a fiat-to-Bitcoin (BTC) conversion service through the website Destination Bitcoin. As such, Green reportedly would receive money from his customers in order to convert their cash to BTC. The findings further indicated that Green had not registered with the Secretary of the United States Treasury in any capacity.

As noted in the announcement, a person is required by federal law to register any money transmitting businesses with the Secretary of the Treasury.

Potential sentencing

Regarding monetary quantities and compensation, the report says that Green converted over $2 million in fiat money to BTC. Moreover, the maximum penalty for Green’s alleged crime is 5 years imprisonment and a $250,000 fine.

According to the DoJ, Green was charged over the same issue in a criminal complaint filed on February 28.

As previously reported by Cointelegraph, the State of New Jersey filed a complaint last week about purportedly unregistered securities sales within its borders.

"Kansas man who murdered teen, elderly woman among 5 inmates to be executed when capital punishment resumes",https://fox4kc.com,[],07-25-2019,2019,7,https://fox4kc.com/2019/07/25/kansas-man-who-murdered-teen-elderly-woman-among-5-inmates-to-be-executed-when-capital-punishment-resumes/,"WASHINGTON — The Justice Department said Thursday that it will carry out executions of federal death row inmates for the first time since 2003.

Five inmates who have been sentenced to death are scheduled to be executed starting in December. Among those five is Kansas man Wesley Ira Purkey.

According the Department of Justice, Purkey will be put to death Dec. 13.

Purkey was convicted of violently raping and murdering 16-year-old Jennifer Long of Kansas City. According to the conviction he, “then dismembered, burned, and dumped the young girl’s body in a septic pond. He also was convicted in state court for using a claw hammer to bludgeon to death an 80-year-old woman who suffered from polio and walked with a cane. On Nov. 5, 2003, a jury in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri found Purkey guilty of kidnapping a child resulting in the child’s death, and he was sentenced to death. Purkey’s execution is scheduled to occur on Dec. 13, 2019.”

The other inmates to be executed include:

Daniel Lewis Lee

Lezmond Mitchell

Alfred Bourgeois

Dustin Lee Honken

In 2014, following a botched state execution in Oklahoma, then-President Barack Obama directed the department to conduct a broad review of capital punishment and issues surrounding lethal injection drugs. It remains unclear today what came of that review and whether it will change the way the federal government carries out executions.

That review has been completed and the executions can continue, the department said.

Executions on the federal level have been rare. The government has put to death only three defendants since restoring the federal death penalty in 1988, the most recent of which occurred in 2003, when Louis Jones was executed for the 1995 kidnapping, rape and murder of a young female soldier.

“Congress has expressly authorized the death penalty through legislation adopted by the people’s representatives in both houses of Congress and signed by the President,” Attorney General William Barr said in a news release. “The Justice Department upholds the rule of law_and we owe it to the victims and their families to carry forward the sentence imposed by our justice system.”

Capital punishment has emerged as a flashpoint in the Democratic presidential primary, with former Vice President Joe Biden this week shifting to call for the elimination of the federal death penalty after years of supporting it. Biden’s criminal justice plan also would encourage states to follow the federal government in ending the death penalty, 25 years after he helped pass a tough crime bill that expanded capital punishment for more potential offenses.

The lone Democratic White House hopeful who has publicly supported preserving capital punishment in certain circumstances is Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, who has said he would leave it open as an option for major crimes such as terrorism."

Derek Mize and Jonathan Gregg, who married in New York in 2015, had their daughter Simone Mize-Gregg via surrogacy in England in 2018, their lawyer said in a statement. Both fathers are listed on the birth certificate.

When they applied for Simone's US citizenship, the US consulate in London rejected their application, the release said. ""The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) states that children of married U.S. citizens born abroad are U.S. citizens from birth so long as one of their parents has lived in the U.S. at some point, but the State Department routinely denies that right to same-sex couples and their children,"" the statement says.

The House last week voted mostly along party lines, 230-198, to hold Barr and Ross in criminal contempt of Congress for defying congressional subpoenas, in a largely symbolic effort. House Democrats were seeking information about Trump's efforts to add the controversial question.

Trump asserted executive privilege and told Barr and Ross not to release certain documents in response to the subpoenas from the House Oversight and Reform Committee.

BOOKER INTRODUCES BILL TO RESTRICT USE OF CENSUS CITIZENSHIP QUESTION

""The Department of Justice's longstanding position is that we will not prosecute an official for contempt of Congress for declining to provide information subject to a presidential assertion of executive privilege,"" Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen said in a Wednesday letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.

Democrats have accused the Trump administration of lying about the origin of the citizenship question. Critics of the question have suggested it was intended to discourage immigrant participation in the census, affecting the population figures that determine legislative representation.

Neither Pelosi nor House Oversight and Reform Committee chairman Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., immediately responded to Fox News for comment Wednesday.

Rosen said the DOJ has taken the same position across several administrations. He cited a 2008 case in which the agency declined to prosecute Joshua Bolten and Harriet Miers, two high-ranking Bush administration officials who refused to testify before a panel investigating the firing of several U.S. attorneys.

TRUMP DECLARES PUSH FOR CENSUS CITIZENSHIP QUESTION NOT OVER, CALLS REPORTS ‘FAKE’

Bush directed Bolten, then the White House chief of staff, and Miers, White House counsel, not to release certain documents or to provide certain testimony related to a congressional subpoena.

The department took a similar position in 2012 when former President Barack Obama directed Attorney General Eric Holder to withhold certain documents related to the government gun-running project, dubbed Operation Fast and Furious.

In accordance with the policy, the department determined the responses by Barr and Ross to the subpoenas ""did not constitute a crime,"" Rosen said.

US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin Thinks Outlook for Bitcoin Is Bleak,https://www.coindesk.com,[],07-24-2019,2019,7,https://www.coindesk.com/ius-treasury-secretary-mnuchin-thinks-outlook-for-bitcoin-is-bleak,"U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin commented on cryptocurrency’s future viability, in an interview on Wednesday.

“I can assure you I will personally not be loaded up on bitcoin in 10 years,” Mnuchin said on CNBC’s Squawk Box. “I would bet even in five to six years I won’t even be talking about bitcoin as Treasury Secretary.”

While Mnuchin’s comments today do not elucidate his specific regulatory policies, he said previously that cryptocurrencies pose “risk to the financial system” if misused like Swiss bank accounts.

To prevent financial crime or monetary distortion, the Secretary has called upon the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) and the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) to design guidance that will hold cryptocurrencies to the highest standards.

Today he added, “We’re going to make sure we have a unified approach and my guess is that there are going to be more regulations that come out from all these agencies.”

On July 18, Mnuchin erroneously claimed that fiat currencies are not vehicles for money laundering, while “there are billions of dollars of transactions going on in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for illicit purposes.”

Several media outlets – including Squawk Box anchor Joe Kernan, at the time – responded with incredulity. Tom Robinson, CEO of research firm Elliptic, wrote an OpEd for VentureBeat claiming, “Less than 0.5 percent of bitcoin transactions are used for illicit purchases.”

While Mnuchin seems to think crypto’s future is bleak, he continues to bat for the U.S. dollar.

Mnuchin added later in today’s interview, “I think the dollar is the reserve currency in the world. It’s in our interest. We want to maintain it.”

"Why Mueller said he couldn’t indict Trump, explained",https://www.vox.com,"['Jul', 'Instead Of Prosecuting The President', 'Mueller Laid Out A Path For Congress To Take Action']",07-24-2019,2019,7,https://www.vox.com/2019/7/24/20708393/robert-mueller-report-trump-olc-justice-department-indictment-charge-sitting-president,"During his congressional testimony on Wednesday, former special counsel Robert Mueller noted that part of his decision to refrain from considering an indictment of President Donald Trump was attributed to a long-standing Justice Department policy: According to the agency’s Office of Legal Counsel, a sitting president cannot be charged with a federal crime.

“We, at the outset, determined that, when it came to the president’s culpability, we needed to go forward only after taking into account the OLC opinion that indicated that a sitting president cannot be indicted,” he said.

The OLC policy itself is relatively straightforward: Most recently reevaluated in 2000, it argues that the executive branch would be incapacitated by a criminal prosecution:

The indictment or criminal prosecution of a sitting President would unconstitutionally undermine the capacity of the executive branch to perform its constitutionally assigned functions.

In his report, Mueller did not ultimately charge the president. He made clear during his afternoon testimony that because of the OLC opinion, his team did not even reach a conclusion about “whether the president committed a crime.” This point was a major clarification of an earlier exchange in which Mueller seemed to signal that he would have potentially charged the president, were it not for the OLC opinion.

Despite the report’s lack of indictment, however, Mueller stopped short of exonerating the president on counts of obstruction of justice. As one notable line in the report states, “If we had confidence after a thorough investigation of the facts that the President clearly did not commit obstruction of justice, we would so state.” Mueller declined to state.

Legal experts have previously told Vox’s Sean Illing that there is no larger Supreme Court case regarding, specifically, whether a president can be charged for actions that have been taken while in office. The DOJ’s policy on the matter is one that it has determined on its own, and it’s broadly seen as binding for federal officials. As Mueller’s report and testimony indicated, he has continued to adhere to it, laying out a roadmap for Congress to take action in the wake of the report.

Legal experts say the president can be prosecuted by the states, despite the OLC policy

According to multiple legal experts, there have been no Supreme Court cases that have settled the question of whether a sitting president can be indicted. The DOJ’s OLC, however crafted its own policy on this question. (The OLC is a body within the DOJ that provides legal advice to many different parts of the executive branch, including the Attorney General’s office.)

It ultimately concluded that prosecution of the president by the DOJ has the potential to create a separation of powers conflict with Congress. Additionally, it could distract from the president’s responsibilities in office.

“There is nothing in the Constitution that prevents a sitting president from being indicted,” says Loyola Law School professor Jessica Levinson. “There is nothing in Supreme Court opinions that prevents a sitting president from being indicted. All we have is Department of Justice policy based largely on concerns over separation of powers.”

Because the OLC policy applies specifically to the DOJ, there is the possibility that states could pursue their own charges that the federal government refrains from doing.

“If federal prosecutors refuse to hold the president to the same legal standard as any other citizen, state attorneys general could certainly charge a president with a state crime with sufficient evidence,” Stetson University law professor Ciara Torres-Spelliscy previously told Illing.

Some experts caution, however, that any type of charge brought against the president would likely result in a lengthy set of court challenges that could go all the way up to the Supreme Court.

Instead of prosecuting the president, Mueller laid out a path for Congress to take action

Mueller’s report may have abstained from charging the president, but it offered a blueprint for Congress to follow if lawmakers wanted to pursue further investigation.

As Vox’s Ella Nilsen writes, Mueller emphasizes that Congress has the ability to determine if the president obstructed justice. One key line of the report lays this out, noting, “The conclusion that Congress may apply obstruction laws to the President’s corrupt exercise of the powers of office accords with our constitutional system of checks and balances and the principle that no person is above the law.”

Congressional action is the most direct means of addressing any potential criminal activity by President Donald Trump, some legal experts say.

“Even if, to use Trump’s own example, he shot someone on Fifth Avenue, the only remedy would be for the president to be impeached by the House, convicted and removed from office by the Senate, and only then prosecuted in criminal court,” Georgetown University Law Professor Paul Butler has said. “If there is no impeachment, that’s a political crisis, not a constitutional one.”

As of yet, House Democrats have held off on pursuing an impeachment inquiry. It’s unclear whether Mueller’s testimony on Wednesday will change that."

The Justice Department will not bring criminal charges against Attorney General William Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross after the Democrat-led House voted last week to hold them in contempt.

In a letter to Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Wednesday, Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen said the Cabinet officials’ defiance of congressional subpoenas seeking information about the 2020 census “did not constitute a crime.”

Story Continued Below

“[A]ccordingly the department will not bring the congressional contempt citations before a grand jury or take any other action to prosecute the attorney general or the secretary,” Rosen wrote, citing legal precedents from administration of both parties.

Lawmakers never expected the Justice Department to prosecute its own leader and another cabinet official, but Rosen’s letter represented the department’s formal response to a House vote that, in effect, referred Barr and Ross for criminal prosecution.

The House Oversight and Reform Committee subpoenaed both departments earlier this year as part of its investigation into the origins of efforts to add a citizenship question to the census. The Justice and Commerce departments refused to provide the documents requested, and President Donald Trump asserted executive privilege to block the release of those materials.

“The Department of Justice’s long-standing position is that we will not prosecute an official for contempt of Congress for declining to provide information subject to a presidential assertion of executive privilege,” Rosen wrote in his two-page letter to Pelosi.

It remains unclear if the House will go to court to enforce the Oversight Committee’s subpoenas.

The Supreme Court last month blocked the Trump administration from adding a citizenship question to the 2020 census, and Trump ultimately backed down from the effort after flirting with an executive order.

The FTC isn’t done with Facebook. Now it’s investigating antitrust claims.,https://www.vox.com,['Jul'],07-24-2019,2019,7,https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/7/24/20726373/ftc-facebook-antitrust-investigation-doj,"Facebook’s $5 billion fine and privacy settlement doesn’t mean the social network is out of the federal government’s crosshairs.

Yesterday, the Department of Justice announced it would be conducting antitrust investigations of multiple big tech companies, and it seems likely that Facebook will be one of them.

Now Facebook says the Federal Trade Commission — the same agency that just reached the $5 billion settlement with Facebook — has also started an antitrust investigation, and that the company has known about it since June.

That news won’t be a total surprise, since it mostly confirms earlier reports that the FTC would be targeting Facebook as part of an ongoing turf war/division of labor with the DOJ. But it’s still significant enough that Facebook is telling shareholders about it via its quarterly earnings release today.

And it reaffirms the idea that while Facebook has taken great pains to explain that the $5 billion settlement is a Very Big Deal and that Facebook can now look forward, it is still going to be dealing with the federal government for a long time. And that’s not counting actual legislation that could actually affect Facebook, if Congress actually decides it wants to get into the business of regulating Silicon Valley’s largest companies instead of issuing press releases about it (and hoping federal agencies do the work).

The other thing, of course, that Facebook accomplishes by doing this is it prepares investors for the idea that the Feds aren’t done with it. That’s what the company did earlier this summer when it told Wall Street that it would end up getting fined $3 billion to $5 billion for privacy failures. So when news of the $5 billion fine finally showed up, the company’s investors celebrated and pushed the company’s stock up.

Facebook’s earnings call starts at 5 pm ET. We’ll update this post if warranted.

Judge Rules Trump’s EPA Flouting Clean Air Act As Denver Ozone Spikes Again,https://www.westword.com,['Chase Woodruff'],07-24-2019,2019,7,https://www.westword.com/news/judge-rules-trump-epa-flouting-clean-air-act-as-denver-ozone-spikes-again-11422270,"As ozone pollution in the Denver metro area took another turn for the worse this week, a federal judge ruled that the Environmental Protection Agency is violating clean-air laws by delaying a key decision on local air-quality standards.

In a ruling issued Monday, July 22, Judge John Kane of the U.S. District Court in Denver found that EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler has “failed to perform a nondiscretionary duty” by delaying a determination regarding the metro area’s classification under the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for ozone pollution. The partial summary judgment came as a result of a lawsuit filed by environmental group WildEarth Guardians against Wheeler and the EPA earlier this year. Court filings show that the agency didn’t object to Kane’s ruling.

“This is the Trump administration’s EPA on full display,” says Jeremy Nichols, WildEarth Guardians’ climate and energy program director. “They just refuse to comply with the law. They’re willing to keep dragging their feet to the point where they get ruled against in court, because they don’t want to comply. They don’t want to have to clamp down.”

The group's lawsuit revolves around a regulatory decision that was due to be made by the EPA earlier this year. For more than a decade now, a nine-county region known as the Denver Metro/North Front Range Nonattainment Area has exceeded federal standards for ozone pollution that were set by the agency in 2008. The state faced a January 2019 deadline to bring the area's air quality into compliance, or be reclassified from ""moderate nonattainment"" to ""serious nonattainment,"" which would require regulators to impose stricter regulations on polluters. The state missed the deadline — air pollution in Denver got worse last year, not better — but the EPA's attainment determination hasn't yet been made.

""This is a simple finding that they need to make,"" says Nichols. ""It's not a complicated action. It's very clear that Colorado failed to meet the 2008 ozone air-quality standards, so this shouldn't be happening. It's a sign of how nuts the Trump administration is, and how they just refuse to take their legal duties seriously. And unfortunately, it's our clean air that suffers.""

The EPA did not respond directly to questions regarding the attainment determination and when it's expected to be made. ""EPA supports the state’s efforts to address ozone issues along the Front Range,"" EPA Region 8 spokesperson Lisa McClain-Vanderpool said in an email. ""The Agency does not comment on ongoing litigation.""

Monday's court ruling came as ozone pollution in Denver began to rise to its highest level of the year so far, reaching an eight-hour Air Quality Index of 133 on Tuesday, July 23. Parts of metro Denver reached one-hour ozone concentrations of 100 parts per billion on Monday and Tuesday, according to state air-quality data — levels that are considered “unhealthy” for all groups on the AQI scale.

High levels of ozone pollution are expected to continue along the Front Range this week. In a forecast issued this morning, officials with the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment warned that ""active children and adults, and people with lung disease, such as asthma, should reduce prolonged or heavy outdoor exertion"" in the afternoon and evening, when ozone levels are typically at their daily peak.

Ground-level ozone is a so-called criteria pollutant that can cause a wide variety of negative health effects, from acute symptoms such as coughing and shortness of breath to chronic conditions like asthma and emphysema. It's formed primarily by the interaction between sunlight and ""ozone precursors"" like volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxides. In Denver, studies have shown that the two largest sources of ozone-forming pollutants are motor vehicles and oil and gas facilities along the Front Range, both of which can account for up to 40 percent of local ozone production on a given day.

A reclassification to serious nonattainment by the EPA would force CDPHE regulators to subject those emissions sources to a higher degree of scrutiny and regulation. In March, Governor Jared Polis withdrew a state request, made by his predecessor John Hickenlooper, for an extension to meet the federal ozone standards. ""There’s more we can do to protect our air quality and health, and we should do it sooner not later,"" Polis said at the time.

Even if the extension hadn't been withdrawn, it would have expired last week. Nichols and WildEarth Guardians, along with other environmental groups, have launched a campaign to pressure the CDPHE to act now, without waiting for the Trump administration to finally tell state officials what they already know.

""Having the backing of the EPA's finding forces them to [act], but the state shouldn't have to be forced to clean up the air,"" Nichols says. ""They could start to implement more rigorous permitting; they could start to put emissions on track. They could be taking some actions now.""

Labor secretary nominee Eugene Scalia faces conflict of interest problem in labor lawyer brother,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-25-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/economy/labor-secretary-nominee-eugene-scalia-faces-conflict-of-interest-problem-in-labor-lawyer-brother,"Labor secretary nominee Eugene Scalia may be obligated to recuse himself from some agency litigation, ethics experts say, because his younger brother John is a high-profile management-side lawyer involved in cases before the agency.

The situation would be an unusual one, because it doesn't involve a financial conflict of interest, just a familial one, and it is not clear how it will be addressed by the administration.

Family ties can create tricky situations for officials regardless of how they handle them. For example, Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts slammed then-Securities and Exchange Committee Chairwoman Mary Jo White in 2015 for recusing herself from SEC cases in which her husband was a litigator, arguing her recusals disrupted the SEC by stalling prosecutions.

President Trump last week tapped the elder brother, Eugene, 55, to replace the departing labor secretary, Alexander Acosta, who stepped down following criticism of his 2008 prosecution as a U.S. attorney of sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein. Scalia has worked with the private sector management-side firm Gibson Dunn, where he has led its Labor and Employment Practice Group for the past 12 years.

John, the second-oldest son of the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, is a shareholder at the firm GreenbergTraurig, where he also practices labor law. According to John's bio on the firm's website, ""He practices regularly in federal and state courts, in private mediation and arbitration proceedings, and before the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL), and equivalent state administrative agencies.""

In a 2008 case, for example, John Scalia defended a company, L-3 Services, when the Department of Labor, then headed by now-Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, alleged it violated overtime rules. It eventually agreed to pay $700,000 in backpay to victims. In a 2015 case, he defended the chief operating officer of a company, Chimes DC, alleged to have violated fiduciary duties. A district court threw out the charges against his client late last year.

The Scalia brothers' overlapping business is a potential problem, said Wilma Liebman, former chairwoman of the National Labor Relations Board, a separate federal agency that enforces labor laws.

""Surely Eugene’s involvement as secretary in any matter in which his brother John is involved would scream conflict of interest, or at least appearance of conflict — equally critical. I would think that he would have to recuse himself from any involvement in such a case,"" said Liebman, now a senior research associate at Harvard Law School's labor and worklife program.

It doesn't matter if the elder brother isn't directly involved in any litigation, she said. ""I don’t think the department head is sufficiently removed from litigation that it does not matter. For one, litigation brought by or against the department is in the name of the secretary,"" she said.

The proper course of action, said Scott Amey, chief counsel for the Project on Government Oversight, a nonprofit watchdog group, would be for Scalia ""to be recused from handling or participating in any cases that would involve his brother or possibly even his brother's firm, just make sure there isn't even an appearance of a conflict of interest."" All matters regarding the litigation would have to be handled the next in line at the department, the deputy secretary. That would likely be Patrick Pizzella, who is the department's acting secretary until the Senate confirms a new head of the cabinet agency.

Amey said that, in the Scalias' case, Eugene would also need to ensure that there is no ""trickle down effect"" where cases brought by his brother's firm receive preferential treatment by people in the department who think it might win favor with the department head. What complicates the situation, Amey noted, is that most ethics rules are written to prevent financial conflicts of interest. Family connections don't necessarily involve such financial ties, but can still represent a potential conflict. There is little precedent for addressing the possible conflicts, according to Amey and others contacted by the Washington Examiner.

The elder Scalia will likely address the matter in an agreement made with the Office of Government Ethics, said an individual with knowledge of the process. All nominees for a cabinet-level position must make such an agreement, which is then reviewed and agreed upon by the cabinet agency’s chief ethics official and OGE. The agreement outlines any conflicts and how they will be addressed. It is posted publicly.

""We are mindful of ethical obligations and it is our duty to comply with them. In the event where an attorney would need to appear before a family member we would adhere to all applicable ethical guidelines,"" a spokesman for Greenberg Taurig told the Washington Examiner.

The White House has not said whether Scalia has submitted anything to OGE, though Amey noted it is still early in the nomination process. The White House and Labor Department declined to comment.

"After Trump’s DOJ instructed Mueller not to answer questions, House GOP attacks him for complying",https://thinkprogress.org,[],,,,https://thinkprogress.org/trump-doj-instructed-mueller-not-to-answer-questions-house-gop-attacks-him-c5a231353ab7/,"President Donald Trump’s Justice Department wrote to former special counsel Robert Mueller this week, instructing him to limit his congressional testimony to what was in his report. On Wednesday, House Republicans openly attacked him for doing just that.

“Any testimony must remain within the boundaries of your public report because matters within the scope of your investigation were covered by executive privilege, including information protected by law enforcement, deliberative process, attorney work product, and presidential communications privileges,” Associate Deputy Attorney General Bradley Weinsheimer instructed Mueller in his letter. “These privileges would include discussion about investigative steps or decisions made during your investigation not otherwise described in the public version of your report.”

In his appearance before the House Judiciary Committee Wednesday, Mueller answered questions cautiously, frequently declining to respond to queries that strayed from those boundaries and referring committee members to the written report.

But Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC) tweeted out an attack on Mueller during the hearing, calling it “remarkable” that “Mueller can’t answer key questions, seems unaware of basic information.”

This is remarkable. Mueller can’t answer key questions, seems unaware of basic information, and admitted he denied exoneration of Trump over a standard that doesn’t exist. No one needs to discredit this process. Team Mueller and House Democrats are discrediting it by themselves. — Mark Meadows (@RepMarkMeadows) July 24, 2019

Rep. Jeff Duncan (R-SC) tweeted Meadows’ smear.

Rep. Debbie Lesko (R-AZ) also joined in, accusing him of “having trouble answering basic questions.”

Mueller seems to be having trouble answering basic questions. — Debbie Lesko (@DebbieLesko) July 24, 2019

Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) accused Mueller of being “intellectually disheveled.”

“He seemed to not have a strong command of the facts and he seemed unwilling to answer basic questions the American people want to know,” he told the Miami Herald.

DOJ won't prosecute contempt citation against Barr and Ross,https://www.cnn.com,['David Shortell'],07-24-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/24/politics/doj-contempt-wont-prosecute-barr-ross/index.html,"Washington (CNN) The Department of Justice won't prosecute the attorney general or Commerce secretary after the House voted earlier this month to hold them in criminal contempt, Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen said Wednesday.

In a letter to Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, Rosen described the department's ""long-standing position"" to not prosecute an official for contempt of Congress ""for declining to provide information subject to a presidential assertion of executive privilege.""

Pelosi tweeted Tuesday that she had signed the contempt citations for Attorney General Bill Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, which were approved mainly along party lines in the House. The citations followed resistance from the Justice and Commerce departments to provide a full range of documents requested by the House Oversight Committee as part of its investigation into the addition of a citizenship question on the 2020 Census.

The move to not prosecute the twin contempt citations was widely expected, and followed a similar move by the Justice Department under President Barack Obama, which declined to pursue contempt charges referred by Congress against then-Attorney General Eric Holder.

Both agencies have maintained that they have already provided thousands of documents to the committee about the census question, and that certain documents which had been withheld were done so in line with a federal court ruling that said that many of the same documents were privileged from disclosure in civil litigation.

A crackdown on working from home is pushing the EPA’s workforce in Boston to the brink,https://www.bostonglobe.com,[],07-24-2019,2019,7,https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2019/07/24/limits-telework-could-last-straw-embattled-epa-workers-say/eD4WGzT3XQ2NFV1198xcKL/story.html,"“There’s a lot of things this administration has done that makes it difficult to work here, but this is the first thing that’s really hit staff on a personal level,” said a public liaison for superfund site cleanups who moved to Exeter, N.H. — a nearly two-hour train ride from Boston — in part because of her ability to work from home two days a week, which allows her to pick up her 2-year-old from day care.

The Trump administration’s disregard for the Environmental Protection Agency’s mission has riled many agency veterans, particularly when it comes to sustainability and climate change. But a new crackdown on working from home is pushing the already beleaguered workforce in Boston to the brink.

Like other EPA employees who talked to the Globe, she asked that her name not be used.

The directive has left some staff members scrambling to find last-minute help with child care, the employee said. Others are looking for new jobs.

“This could be the last straw,” she said.

The new policy on remote work requires that, as of Aug. 4, the 10,000 EPA employees around the country who are members of the American Federation of Government Employees must be in the office at least four days a week, including those with compressed work schedules. The directive is part of a widespread attempt to reduce the federal workforce by eroding workers’ rights and driving out career employees who may disagree with President Trump’s beliefs, labor analysts say.

The limits on remote work, which was previously allowed two days a week, are part of a new contract that management refers to as a collective bargaining agreement and the union, which was not involved in any bargaining, calls an illegal “unilateral edict.” The contract also puts new restrictions on union activity, curtailing the amount of time union representatives can spend helping employees during the workday; prohibits union officials from using EPA office space and e-mail addresses for official union work; limits the grievance process; and makes it easier for the agency to fire and discipline workers.

These restrictions align with three executive orders issued by Trump in 2018 to curb the power of federal unions. With these orders being challenged in court, labor analysts say, the administration appears to be trying to instead implement them agency by agency.

Similar contract fights are roiling other government agencies, along with directives that labor analysts say are intended to weaken and reduce the government workforce, such as moving two Department of Agriculture scientific offices from Washington, D.C., to Kansas City and relocating the majority of the staff at Bureau of Land Management headquarters from D.C. to west of the Rockies.

Two-thirds of the roughly 400 employees affected by the USDA move to the Kansas City area have said they would not move, according to the department.

EPA employees are well aware of Trump’s disdain for their agency. During his presidential campaign, Trump said he wanted to eliminate the EPA; after he was elected, officials talked of reducing the workforce by half.

Boston EPA employees held a rally July 16 to protest the policy changes, and railed at managers during a meeting the same day. The fact that the agency did not provide any explanation about their decision to reduce telework, simply saying it was going to improve efficiency, infuriated the staff. “To not provide any evidence in a science organization is not acceptable,” one person said, according to employees in the meeting.

In the Boston office, union president Steve Calder estimates that around 90 percent of the 450 employees in his bargaining unit work from home one or two days a week. Those who work four days a week will no longer be allowed to work from home at all.

“Morale is in the toilet,” said Calder, noting that some workers are blaming the union for the loss of remote work days because it refused to negotiate. “The Trump administration loves chaos. . . . That’s part of their MO: chaos, infighting, fear.”

Talks between the EPA and the union ground to a halt in mid-June, when AFGE filed a grievance over the agency’s effort to renegotiate the entire contract and walked away from the bargaining table. On July 8, the EPA implemented a new contract, a spokesperson said, “as is the agency’s right following the union’s refusal to bargain.”

“The contract provides more accountability and efficiency in dealings between the union, employees, and management, consistent with the direction set by the Administration,” the spokesperson said.

Already, so many longtime employees have left the EPA nationwide that there is a significant experience gap among the ranks, according to a scientist in the Boston office. And the recent changes will only add to the brain drain. “There will be more longer term damage in the loss of institutional knowledge,” she said.

And that is exactly the point, said David Madland, senior fellow at the left-leaning Center for American Progress. Anyone who has scientific evidence showing that climate change is caused by humans and is capable of causing significant harm, for instance, is a threat to Trump’s beliefs, Madland said. Earlier this month, a State Department intelligence analyst resigned after the White House blocked parts of his written testimony to Congress citing evidence that climate change is a threat to national security.

“By weakening unions and undermining expertise, it gives Trump greater power to do what he wants without anyone having the ability to challenge him on it,” Madland said.

But according to John York, a policy analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation, federal unions are in need of reform. Public sector employees already have more statutory protections than workers in the private sector, he said.

Federal unions are pushing back particularly hard since the Supreme Court’s Janus decision, he said, which reduced unions’ ability to collect fees from workers and put them on the defensive.

“Many of the forgotten men in Trump’s base see federal employees as more protected, higher paid, less hard-working than they are,” said York, who nonetheless insisted that the union changes were not politically motivated. “I think Trump’s efforts are trying to get federal personnel practices more in line with the rest of the labor market.”

An attorney at the Boston EPA office noted that, like other employees, she could have made more money in the private sector. But, in addition to believing in the mission, the attorney valued the benefits and flexibility of working for the government. Now all of that is under fire.

The administration’s attitude seems to be: “We’re going to make it difficult for you to carry out your mission of using science and the law to protect the environment,” said the attorney, who lives an hour south of Boston and had been planning to increase her remote-work schedule so she could do more day care drop-offs and pickups. “And now we’re also going to make it difficult for you to spend time with your families.”

The clampdown at the EPA is part of an “unmistakable pattern” of hostility toward public servants, said Sharon Block, a former labor adviser to former president Barack Obama who runs the Labor and Worklife Program at Harvard Law School.

And the repercussions could go far beyond the current workforce.

“There’s just a point at which you can’t help but impact the level of service,” she said, “when you’ve so degraded those who provide the service.”

Facebook and Other Big Tech Stocks Are Barely Moving on the DoJ’s New Probe. Here’s Why.,https://www.barrons.com,['Eric J. Savitz'],,,,https://www.barrons.com/articles/doj-investigation-tech-stocks-51563989279,"Text size

Large-cap tech shares are mostly shrugging off the news that the U.S. Department of Justice plans to review “the practices of market-leading online platforms.” Indeed, today’s news is brimming with reports on regulatory actions against tech businesses—but the real market moving news on tech this week will be financial.

Facebook (ticker: FB) reports earnings Wednesday; Alphabet (GOOGL) and Amazon.com (AMZN) report Thursday. On Tuesday, Snap (SNAP) reported huge user growth, and the stock is on fire. Investors don’t believe that Washington’s investigations will have a material impact on big tech’s financial results, so they are largely ignoring them for now.

It’s a busy day on the regulatory front, even aside from the DoJ story.

Facebook (FB) reached an agreement with the Federal Trade Commission to pay a $5 billion fine over the company’s data privacy practices. In announcing the penalty, the FTC said the agreement also “requires Facebook to restructure its approach to privacy from the corporate board-level down, and establishes strong new mechanisms to ensure that Facebook executives are accountable for the decisions they make about privacy, and that those decisions are subject to meaningful oversight.”

Facebook said the agreement “provides a comprehensive new framework for protecting people’s privacy and the information they give us.”

But Democrats on the Commission observed that the penalties were more or less meaningless in the larger scheme of things—something investors had already figured out.

“The proposed settlement does little to change [Facebook’s] business model or practices,” writes Commissioner Rohit Chopra in a dissenting opinion. “The settlement imposes no meaningful changes to the company’s structure or financial incentives, which led to these violations. Nor does it include any restrictions on the company’s mass surveillance or advertising tactics. Instead, the order allows Facebook to decide for itself how much information it can harvest from users and what it can do with that information, as long as it creates a paper trail.”

Commissioner Rebecca Kelly Slaughter writes in her own dissent that in the interest of shedding a spotlight on Facebook’s behavior, the FTC should have litigated the matter. “The Commission would better serve the public interest and be more likely to effectively change Facebook by fighting for the right outcome in a public court of law,” she writes.

Meanwhile, Facebook yesterday also reached a deal with the Securities and Exchange Commission to pay a $100 million fine “for making misleading disclosures regarding the risk of misuse of Facebook user data,” a case tied to the Cambridge Analytica scandal. (On Wednesday, Netflix happened to unveil a new documentary on Facebook and the Cambridge Analytica story called The Great Hack.)

Additionally, The Wall Street Journal reports that Apple (APPL) appears to be favoring its own apps in App Store searches. The Journal writes that “the company’s apps ranked first in more than 60% of basic searches, such as for ‘maps,’ the analysis showed. Apple apps that generate revenue through subscriptions or sales, like Music or Books, showed up first in 95% of searches related to those apps.”

While the DoJ announcement Tuesday didn’t name names, there’s little mystery about which companies the government has in mind.

“The Department’s review will consider the widespread concerns that consumers, businesses, and entrepreneurs have expressed about search, social media, and some retail services online,” the government said in a press release.

“The goal of the Department’s review is to assess the competitive conditions in the online marketplace in an objective and fair-minded manner and to ensure Americans have access to free markets in which companies compete on the merits to provide services that users want. If violations of law are identified, the Department will proceed appropriately to seek redress.”

The language suggests they are going after four of the world’s largest companies by market cap—Alphabet’s Google unit dominates search, Facebook rules social media, and Amazon.com is synonymous with online retail. Apple likely falls under the online retail rubric, as well, given its dominant App Store platform.

A spokesman for Google declined to comment on the DoJ announcement directly, and instead pointed to testimony last week by Adam Cohen, Google’s director of economic policy, during a House subcommittee hearing on online platforms. “In the face of intense competition, we are proud of our record of continued innovation,” he said. “We have helped reduce prices and expand choice for consumers and merchants in the U.S. and around the world. We have created new competition in many sectors, and new competitive pressures often lead to concerns from rivals. We have consistently shown how our business is designed and operated to benefit our customers.”

Apple declined to comment on the DoJ announcement, while Facebook and Amazon didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.

Microsoft (MSFT), largely a cloud play now and the world’s most valuable public company, was once the government’s favorite tech target. It appears to have avoided the investigators this time around.

It’s not entirely clear how the DoJ announcement relates to previous news that the FTC and the Justice Department had agreed to divvy up their investigatory responsibilities, with Justice taking on Apple and Google, and the FTC focusing on Amazon and Facebook. But the overall intent seems the same—to curb the behavior of tech giants.

So how is this likely to play out?

Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives wrote in a research note Wednesday that any push to break up the companies is likely to fail. Current antitrust law is intended to protect consumers against predatory pricing, not punish companies for being big and successful.

In the cases of Google and Facebook, the companies don’t charge for their primary products—so there’s no pricing, let alone predatory pricing. To assess the market effect of the companies on other measures isn’t impossible, but, Ives notes, it would likely require changes in antitrust law, and in the current political mood in Washington, that seems “exceedingly unlikely.”

Legislation could have a more immediate impact, though, particularly the pending California Consumer Privacy Act, which Barron’srecently covered. The law goes into effect in January and is intended to force changes in the way companies collect and sell personal information. For Google and Facebook, and increasingly for Apple and Amazon, the ability to sell targeted ads is of huge value. Federal legislation to do the same could be the route to real change in the tech business, with a higher probability of success than antitrust enforcement.

Ives predicts that Congress and the DoJ will investigate, and find “no harm, no foul.” He thinks investors should buy all of the big four stocks on any weakness relating to the investigations.

In afternoon trading, Facebook is down 0.4% to $201.51; Alphabet is down 1.2%, to $1,134.75; Apple is down 0.4%, to $208.03; and Amazon is 0.3%, to $1988.95. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite is up 0.4%.

The Justice Department’s antitrust investigation is cause for caution,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Editorial Board', 'July At Pm']",07-24-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-justice-departments-antitrust-investigation-is-cause-for-caution/2019/07/24/0ae8725e-ae43-11e9-bc5c-e73b603e7f38_story.html,"BIG TECH, meet Big Brother.

The Justice Department announced Tuesday a broad-based antitrust review of “the practices of market-leading online platforms,” without naming any names — and without explaining exactly what practices officials believe could be anti-competitive. The country is still catching up to a new era in which a handful of Internet companies have substantial power over Americans’ daily lives, and that power is worth examining. But the scope and circumstances of the investigation announced this week are cause for caution.

Increased interest across the government in scrutinizing top tech firms’ market behavior signals the erosion of the argument that platforms providing free services cannot possibly run afoul of authorities. Some critics believe industry giants are unfairly leveraging their dominance to bury rivals on the Web where Americans cannot see them or sucking up their data to drive them out of the game. Others think so much control resting with so few is itself a problem. President Trump and his allies, however, have seized on a highly specific grievance: Silicon Valley is too liberal, and its leaders are censoring conservatives online.

There is no evidence to support claims of censorship, yet conservatives have turned multiple oversight hearings into circuses full of rhetorical acrobatics and accusations. Only this month, Mr. Trump convened a “social media summit” similarly designed to bully companies for not behaving the way he wants. Last week, he promised to “take a look” at Google after allegations that the company was committing treason by working with the Chinese government. And in June, he explicitly connected Facebook, Google and Amazon to his electoral prospects. (Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Post.) “The real collusion is between the Democrats and these companies,” he told CNBC. “They were so against me during my election run. Everybody said, ‘If you don’t have them, you can’t win.’ Well, I won. And I’ll win again.”

It is wishful to think that an increasingly political Justice Department operates independent of these pressures. We already know the president reportedly sought to push authorities to block a major media merger because of his animosity toward CNN. And last September, officials said outright that a meeting with state attorneys general about antitrust would revolve around concerns that companies were “intentionally stifling the free exchange of ideas on their platforms” — giving the lie to the argument that enthusiasm for a probe is untethered from the president’s perennial personal gripes.

Antitrust investigations should be targeted to particular practices by particular companies that hurt consumers or impede competition. They should not be a cudgel brandished against an entire industry for a vague set of violations that could well include having Democratic employees and leaders. Antitrust advocates worried about the concentration of power in one place should take care not to champion an even more dangerous accumulation in another."
Mueller scrambles hearing by tapping top deputy as counsel,https://www.politico.com,"['Andrew Desiderio', 'Kyle Cheney']",07-23-2019,2019,7,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/07/23/nadler-doj-mueller-testimony-1426721,"Robert Mueller's spokesman Jim Popkin on Monday said he didn’t know yet who would be joining the former special counsel at the hearing | Carolyn Kaster/AP File Photo Legal Mueller scrambles hearing by tapping top deputy as counsel Republicans called the plan a 'stunt' that could be a breach of House rules.

Robert Mueller’s top deputy will appear alongside him for his highly anticipated testimony on Wednesday, according to congressional aides familiar with the preparations, a last-minute curveball that came despite the Justice Department's demand that Mueller’s deputies refrain from testifying.

Aaron Zebley, Mueller’s longtime right-hand man, will appear as Mueller’s counsel when he testifies before the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday morning; but he will be formally sworn in as a witness for the House Intelligence Committee’s hearing with the former special counsel later that afternoon, an aide said.

Story Continued Below

Republicans said any decision to allow Zebley to accompany Mueller as a sworn-in witness would represent a breach of their tentative negotiations. Georgia Rep. Doug Collins, the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, called the prospect a “stunt” and said it could “jeopardize whether tomorrow's hearing complies with the rules of the House.”

“If Democrats believe it is the special counsel’s responsibility to testify to his report, they have no ground for outsourcing that duty at the expense of our committee’s integrity,” Collins said.

No Republicans on the Intelligence Committee, however, joined the public outcry.

Mueller spokesman Jim Popkin on Tuesday confirmed Zebley’s appearance for Mueller’s five hours of combined testimony before the House Judiciary and Intelligence committees.

“Aaron Zebley was the deputy special counsel and had day-to-day oversight of the investigations conducted by the office,” Popkin said. “He will accompany special counsel Mueller to the Wednesday hearings, as was discussed with the committees more than a week ago.”

Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), chairman of the Intelligence Committee, cautioned that Mueller — not Zebley — would be answering lawmakers’ questions.

“Our intention is that Mueller do the testifying and not have someone else do it for him,” Schiff said. “Now, there may be questions that one of his team is better situated to answer of a technical nature. But we don't want a hearing with Bob Mueller converted to a hearing with someone else.”

Both Zebley and James Quarles, another Mueller deputy, initially were expected to testify before the Judiciary and Intelligence committees behind closed doors, but those sessions were called off amid opposition from Attorney General William Barr.

Barr has said that Mueller’s deputies should not testify, and he suggested that the Justice Department would move to block them from appearing if the committees issued subpoenas to compel their testimony. It is unclear whether the Justice Department will try to disrupt Wednesday’s arrangement.

The move threatens to further inflame tensions between the Justice Department and House Democrats. Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler on Tuesday blasted President Donald Trump’s Justice Department as “incredibly arrogant” for instructing Mueller to limit the scope of his testimony Wednesday before the Judiciary and Intelligence panels.

But the New York Democrat predicted that the Justice Department’s Monday directive would not affect Wednesday’s highly anticipated pair of hearings with the former special counsel.

“I don't think it's much of an impediment, simply because Bob Mueller had indicated repeatedly that he was going to do exactly that,” Nadler said on CNN. “I think it's incredibly arrogant of the department to try to instruct him as to what to say. It's a part of the ongoing cover-up by the administration to keep information away from the American people, but I think that it's not going to have a real impact.”

And in a letter to Mueller late Tuesday night, Schiff said the Trump administration was seeking to “obstruct the authorized oversight activity and legitimate investigations of the committee.”

“The committee rejects the limitations that the Department of Justice has attempted to place on your testimony on the eve of your appearance before our committee,” Schiff added.

Mueller has stated that his 448-page report “is my testimony” and that he does not intend to speak about topics that were not already made public, presenting Democrats with a challenge when Mueller appears before the House Judiciary and Intelligence panels.

And on Monday, the Justice Department told Mueller that his testimony “must remain within the boundaries of your public report” because the president has asserted executive privilege over the investigation’s underlying evidence, POLITICO first reported.

Nadler said on Tuesday that Democratic lawmakers have “been operating under the assumption that he'll do essentially what he said — he'll stay more or less within the bounds of the report.” But the chairman also said Mueller “does not have to comply” with the Justice Department directives.

“He doesn't work for them,” Nadler said, “and that letter asks things that are beyond the power of the agency to ask even if he still worked for them.”

Despite the Justice Department’s letter to Mueller, it is unlikely the department will insist on having a lawyer in the room during Mueller’s testimony to lodge objections to certain questions — essentially relying on Mueller to self-police his remarks. Mueller is known to strictly adhere to Justice Department guidelines, and Democrats do not expect him to deviate from that practice,

poster=""http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201907/806/1155968404_6063098476001_6063107661001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404""

In May, Trump asserted executive privilege over Mueller’s entire report and underlying materials. The move came after the Judiciary Committee issued a subpoena for the unredacted report and all evidence underpinning it, and the Justice Department’s defiance of that subpoena led the panel to hold Barr in contempt of Congress.

Democrats are eager to ask Mueller several questions about his investigation and his legal conclusions, including whether he would have charged Trump with obstruction of justice if he were not the president — a reference to Justice Department policy that prohibits the indictment of a sitting president. While Mueller is unlikely to answer that question directly, Democrats say there are other ways to illuminate Mueller’s decision not to formally accuse the president of committing a crime.

The Judiciary Committee is expected to focus on five specific episodes of potential obstruction of justice — ones that, according to Mueller, met all three elements required for an obstruction charge.

Judiciary Committee Democrats held a mock hearing on Tuesday afternoon to prepare for their questioning of Mueller. They also rehearsed how they would respond to efforts by Republicans to discredit Mueller’s investigation or lodge procedural objections that could delay the hearing.

House Democrats are planning an all-out messaging blitz over the next few days, blanketing social media with excerpts of Mueller’s report and real-time clips from the hearing. It’s an effort to amplify any of the material Mueller gives them and line it up with the most damaging details of his report.

Democrats also have put together a five-page set of talking points for their colleagues who aren’t as deeply immersed in the Mueller report, distilling Mueller’s dense findings into a digestible summary they can use to help spread the caucus-wide message.

"Automakers rebuff EPA mpg rollbacks, cut side deal with California",https://www.greencarreports.com,"['Eric C. Evarts', 'Eric C. Evarts - Contributor', 'Bengt Halvorson - Senior Editor']",,,,https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1124215_automakers-rebuff-epa-mpg-rollbacks-cut-side-deal-with-california,"Some of the largest automakers in the U.S. have banded together with California—to set an example for the EPA and its long-stalled emissions and fuel economy revamp.

The agreement between Ford, Honda, Volkswagen, and BMW's U.S. division would raise fuel-economy standards by about 3.7 percent a year through 2026 to a final target of about 50 mpg. Current standards call for a 5 percent annual increase through 2025, reaching a final target of about 51 mpg.

The agreement comes as talks have broken down between California and federal officials over the EPA's plans to freeze standards at about 37 mpg through 2026 and to revoke California's longstanding right to set its own tighter emissions standards. Since a 2007 Supreme Court ruling that carbon-dioxide is a pollutant because it leads to global warming, fuel-economy and emissions standards have been directly linked, because the only way to reduce CO2 is to burn less gas.

In releasing the fuel-economy freeze, known as the Safer Fuel-Efficient Vehicles Rule, the Trump administration said the new standards would make cars more affordable and allow more consumers to buy new cars with modern safety equipment, rather than holding onto older cars.

Automakers, along with 23 states have opposed the Trump administration's plans to freeze increases in fuel economy standards. California has launched a lawsuit with more than 16 other states against the EPA over its proposal.

Automakers have called for more modest increases than the current standards require and for more flexibility in meeting them, for example by trading emissions credits among models and between automakers and carrying them over from year to year. The four automakers say the new agreement with California gives them that additional flexibility.

In setting their own agreement with California, the automakers forged a template for other automakers and the EPA to follow and gives the California Air Resources Board a leg up in future negotiations with the EPA.

In a statement announcing the deal, California Governor Gavin Newsom said, ""Few issues are more pressing than climate change, a global threat that endangers our lives and livelihoods....I now call on the rest of the auto industry to join us, and for the Trump administration to adopt this pragmatic compromise instead of pursuing its regressive rule change. It's the right thing for our economy, our people, and our planet.""

California Air Resources Board chair Mary Nichols (via Twitter)

California Air Resources Board chairwoman Mary Nichols said the ""agreement represents a feasible and acceptable path to accomplishing the goals of California and the auto industry. If the White House does not agree, we will move forward with our current standards but work with individual carmakers to implement these principles....If the current federal vehicle standards proposal is finalized, we will continue to enforce our regulations and pursue legal challenges to the federal rule.""

NHTSA, which has federal authority over fuel economy standards and has had to work with the EPA to coordinate them with CO2 emissions standards, issued a statement saying, ""NHTSA and EPA continue to work together toward the final SAFE Vehicles Rule, which will establish maximum feasible standards to which all vehicle manufacturers must comply. The proposal contained no language that would prevent any auto manufacturer from designing and building next-generation highly fuel-efficient vehicles.""

After encountering opposition to its original proposal from automakers and states, the EPA has delayed finalizing its new proposal until at least after Labor Day."
Ethics Office Examines Allegations That Interior Dept. Officials Violated Transparency Laws,https://www.nytimes.com,['Coral Davenport'],07-23-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/23/climate/interior-department-freedom-of-information.html,"Mr. Trump’s first appointee to head the E.P.A., Scott Pruitt, and his first appointee to head the Interior Department, Ryan Zinke, resigned last year after thousands of pages of documents released under Freedom of Information Act requests raised questions about matters such Mr. Pruitt’s alleged spending abuses, first-class travel and relationships with lobbyists, and Mr. Zinke’s efforts to secure taxpayer-funded perks for his wife.

Both men have said that the criticism of their actions was politically and personally motivated, and that they did nothing wrong.

Last year, the Interior Department implemented a new “awareness policy” regarding requests for information and public records under the Freedom of Information Act. The new policy requires career staff reviewing such requests to notify politically appointed officials if their names or email addresses appear in documents that have been designated to be released.

That policy, watchdog groups say, has allowed top officials appointed by President Trump to then withhold or delay the release of such information. “The upshot is that, in practice, the policy has morphed from a procedure that provides awareness to political appointees to one that allows political appointees to unlawfully withhold and delay documents,” said Travis Annatoyn, senior counsel at Democracy Forward, a watchdog group that has requested an Interior Department investigation into the matter.

A spokeswoman for the Interior Department, Molly Block, declined to comment and referred to the Interior Department’s website, which includes a document describing the policy. The page says the policy is intended to streamline the process of the agency’s response to increased Freedom of Information Act requests."
The Trump administration’s latest visa clampdown on Nigeria is targeting high-powered politicians,https://qz.com,[],,,,https://qz.com/africa/1674848/trump-us-state-dept-issues-travel-ban-on-nigerian-politicians/,"Ahead of Nigeria’s general elections back in February, the United States government said it would consider placing visa restrictions on individuals who undermine the process or are involved in organizing electoral violence.

Earlier this week, it made good on its promise and issued visa restrictions on Nigerians who, it says, “operated with impunity at the expense of the Nigerian people and undermined democratic principles and human rights.” Despite email inquiries from Quartz, the US State Department did not name the banned individuals or state how many politicians are affected.

One reason for that, says Matthew Page, a Chatham House fellow and former US State Department official: “The US doesn’t name and shame because visa information is covered by privacy regulations and thus confidential.” The uncertainty around “who or what type of person was targeted or how many” could also see bad actors continue to fear they are at risk, he adds.

While unconfirmed, it’s likely the visa restrictions have been issued to high-level politicians who typically have enough power and access to resources to possibly “undermine” elections or co-ordinate violence.

The restrictions come after elections which were marred by sporadic violence across several parts of the country: according to SBM Intelligence, a Lagos-based geopolitical intelligence firm, over 600 (pdf) people were killed during the last election season. YIAGA Africa, a coalition of election observers, also described the polls as a missed opportunity for Nigeria’s electoral commission to improve the quality of elections.

On the face of it, a US visa ban does not serve as much of a deterrent for errant politicians who will retain the ability to travel elsewhere or simply choose to remain in Nigeria. But such bans, even when not publicly confirmed, are often politicized as indictments on a politician’s transparency record by opponents. One of the more prominent examples is former vice president and 2019 presidential aspirant Atiku Abubakar who has long struggled to shake off talk of being subjected to visa restrictions by the United States over bribery scandals.

While there is some uncertainty as to the visa bans for politicians, the Trump administration has been explicit about its other clampdown measures on visas for Nigerians: it indefinitely suspended an interview waiver program for Nigerian applicants in May.

Even though the US State Department emphasized the actions are “specific to certain individuals and not directed at the Nigerian people or the newly elected government,” it is likely to further unsettle Nigerians interested in applying for US visas and likely spark more speculation.

‘It’s a disaster over there’: Commerce reaches new heights of dysfunction,https://www.politico.com,['Daniel Lippman'],07-22-2019,2019,7,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/07/22/wilbur-ross-commerce-department-dysfunction-1424427,"Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross doesn’t hold routine meetings with senior staffers, according to a person familiar with the department’s inner workings, ""Because he tends to fall asleep in meetings."" | Win McNamee/Getty Images Finance & Tax ‘It’s a disaster over there’: Commerce reaches new heights of dysfunction Under Secretary Wilbur Ross, the department is chaotic and adrift.

Constant infighting among top officials. Sudden departures of senior staffers without explanation. A leader who is disengaged and prone to falling asleep in meetings.

The Commerce Department has reached its apex of dysfunction under Wilbur Ross, according to four people with knowledge of the inner workings of the department. The 81-year-old Commerce secretary, who has for months endured whispers that he is on the outs, spends much of his time at the White House to try to retain President Donald Trump’s favor, the sources said, leaving his department adrift.

Story Continued Below

He’s hardly the only top Trump official to seek the president’s approval. But department insiders say they’ve rarely seen Commerce so rudderless — and they say Ross’ penchant for managing upward at the expense of his staff is leading to what one plugged-in observer described as “a disaster over there.”

“With our ongoing trade wars and the census looming, Commerce needs functional leadership to be effective, and right now they just don’t have it,” said Theo LeCompte, a former top Commerce official in the Obama administration who speaks often with former colleagues.

One common complaint: Ross, a successful investor before Trump tapped him as secretary of Commerce, isn’t frequently seen in the building talking to employees or rallying them to do good work.

“He’s sort of seen as kind of irrelevant. The morale is very low there because there’s not a lot of confidence in the secretary,” said a former outside adviser to Commerce who is still in touch with many employees at the department. “He’s not respected in the building.”

Ross doesn’t hold routine meetings with senior staffers, according to a person familiar with the department’s inner workings and a former outside adviser — a departure from past practice that one source attributed to the secretary’s lack of stamina.

“Because he tends to fall asleep in meetings, they try not to put him in a position where that could happen so they’re very careful and conscious about how they schedule certain meetings,” said the former outside adviser. “There’s a small window where he’s able to focus and pay attention and not fall asleep.”

A Commerce official disputed that criticsm, saying that Ross has frequent afternoon meetings, including “long” meetings on the census.

“Secretary Ross is a tireless worker who is the sole decision-maker at the department,"" said Commerce press secretary Kevin Manning. ""He routinely works 12-hour days and travels often, with visits to seven countries and eight states in the last three months to advance the president’s agenda.""

Yet top Commerce officials have pushed to not have Ross called to testify at congressional oversight hearings, according to two sources close to the department, because they fear he isn’t up to the task. “There’s a great deal of effort to shield him from testifying ever again,” said one of the sources.

A Commerce official disputed that and said, “He’s obviously going to have to testify again. … You can’t get through the rest of [congressional appropriations] season without testifying again.”

Ross did testify at an oversight hearing on the census for nearly seven hours in March, and emerged through the ordeal generally unscathed. But according to one person familiar with the department, the consensus among the top ranks of the administration was that it would be best to avoid a repeat appearance.

“There was a great deal of concern to not have him testify expressed from the White House,” this person said, characterizing the instructions as: “‘Don’t do this, people. Don’t do this, he’s probably not the right guy to go there.’”

Ross certainly has other reasons to avoid Congress — namely, the heated dispute between Hill Democrats and the administration over adding a citizenship question to the 2020 census.

poster=""http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201906/3704/1155968404_6052147728001_6051795407001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404"" true

In April, Ross offered to send aides to testify on his behalf before a House Appropriations subcommittee, an offer the panel’s Democratic chairman, José Serrano, said showed “stunning disrespect.” Serrano’s Republican counterpart, Robert Aderholt, told Reuters that Ross refused to testify out of “concern that this hearing might focus more on political or legal issues than the budget itself.”

“His relationship with the Hill has deteriorated more and more, and he’s just not interested in dealing with the Hill if he can avoid it,” said a person familiar with the department’s internal discussions.

A Commerce official noted that Ross talked to Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) two weeks ago, and held a party two months ago that a number of senators attended. Another Commerce employee observed, “This administration is very hesitant to do oversight in general or to comply with oversight requests in general.”

There are public signs, however, of apparent unease with Ross as a spokesperson for the administration. At an appearance at the White House in mid-July on an announcement on abandoning the citizenship question in the census, the Commerce secretary stood next to Trump the entire time and was one of three people who didn’t speak. Attorney General Bill Barr, on the other hand, spoke at length.

Ross’ relationship with the White House and with Trump was also damaged by stories that came out in the past 18 months showing that he wasn’t as rich as he had claimed and hadn’t fully divested some stock as he had promised, according to the former outside adviser. (The Commerce official disputed that, arguing that the White House has not cared about these issues.)

Ross’s deputies, meanwhile, are coming under fire of their own as tensions rise withini the department.

Political appointees sometimes close doors right in front of career employees to keep them out of meetings, one former Commerce official in touch with former colleagues said.

Meanwhile, “it’s totally infighting among the politicals,” said another person familiar with the department. “It’s just everybody fighting everybody.” In particular, the relationship between Ross’ office and the legislative affairs team is “clearly broken,” this person said.

Charles “Kolo” Rathburn, who had been acting head of legislative affairs, “was unceremoniously let go” and abruptly left earlier in July, according to a person familiar with Commerce and the outside adviser, who said it had to do with issues of professional conduct in the workplace. Another person familiar with Commerce also confirmed his departure.

“He wasn’t allowed to clean out his office,” said one of the people. Rathburn had replaced Mike Platt, who had left in early May.

A Commerce official said Rathburn, who didn’t respond to requests for comment, is working to pass the bar exam and has an offer for a higher-paying position at a law firm if he does.

Ross Branson, who had been deputy assistant secretary of legislative affairs and was Platt’s deputy, also left Commerce on Friday, according to two people familiar with his departure. He had become “collateral damage,” according to one of the people, and was told that he had to look for a new job. He starts on Monday as head of legislative affairs at the Export-Import Bank, a position that a Commerce official described as “definitely a promotion.” Branson and the Ex-Im Bank did not respond to a request for comment.

Much of the tension inside the building has centered on Earl Comstock, who shepherded Ross’ confirmation on Capitol Hill and is one of the secretary’s top lieutenants as the department's policy director.

The disarray inside Commerce is drawing an intervention from chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and other White House officials, who are trying to figure out how to wrest control from Comstock, who increasingly seems to be involved in everything that happens inside the department.

“Things come to a screeching halt because he demands to be the final decision on everything whether it’s an email that goes out to the Hill or a letter to respond to X, Y and Z,” said a person familiar with Commerce.

Comstock, who didn’t respond to requests for comment, has also been at the center of many of the spectrum battles between the Federal Communications Commission and the departments of Transportation, Education, Commerce and NASA and NOAA, according to an administration official. He has “literally been seeding bad intel and bad information to get other people agitated,” said the official.

He also tried to scuttle a joint White House-FCC summit on 5G, the wireless technology, in April by “calling everyone he could 24 hours before the event trying to get it to be canceled,” this person said. Comstock clashed in particular with former National Telecommunications and Information Administration chief David Redl, who left his post abruptly in May.

Critics of Ross’ leadership at Commerce also have a new target of concern: chief of staff Michael Walsh, who is described by some as inexperienced on policy and difficult to work with.

Walsh didn’t respond to a request for comment, but the Commerce official said that he has good relationships throughout the administration and on the Hill and visits the White House frequently. A second person familiar with Commerce also claimed, “People want his job so they’re spreading bad stuff on him.”

The chaos inside the department has had consequences for some employees.

“There’s great frustration among people who really want to use their skills and talents to help this country and are being marginalized by a White House who doesn’t need to ask any questions because it already thinks it has the answers,” said Roger Fisk, a Commerce official in the Obama administration. “All of that expertise is just lying dormant hiding in plain sight.""

Council approves $2B agreement with EPA to upgrade Houston’s sanitary sewers,https://www.houstonchronicle.com,"['Jasper Scherer', 'City Hall Reporter', 'Mike Morris', 'Houston Chronicle', 'Follow Jasper On', 'Follow Mike On', 'Http', 'Todd Ackerman', 'Staff Writer', 'John Mcclain']",07-24-2019,2019,7,https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/Council-approves-2B-agreement-with-EPA-to-14121965.php,"Houston agreed to repair or replace at least 150 miles of sanitary sewer pipe each year and install 2,500 “smart” manhole covers in the next five years under a $2 billion consent decree approved by city council Wednesday.

Prompted by hundreds of sewage spills from broken or overwhelmed pipes each year, the agreement with the federal Environmental Protection Agency requires the city to more aggressively inspect, clean, replace or upgrade its sanitary sewer pipes, lift stations and treatment plants during the next 15 years.

The city also must address nine areas that see voluminous sewage spills during rainstorms, and launch a citywide assessment to better prioritize future projects in neighborhoods across the city as part of the consent decree approved by council by a 15-1 vote.

The agreement is expected to result in additional water rate hikes, starting next year.

A rate study incorporating costs related to the decree — a key method by which the EPA enforces the Clean Water Act — is underway.

“We tried to craft a cost-efficient consent decree that will minimize the impact on our ratepayers,” Mayor Sylvester Turner said Wednesday. “This is not one of those issues that we could have just said 'no' and walked away from.”

The measure passed with opposition only from District G Councilman Greg Travis, who said he was concerned the decree did not cap rate increases or how much the city could spend under the agreement.

Travis also said he was told rates would increase 4 percent annually. Turner said that figure is ""factually incorrect"" and suggested the number may have stemmed from an initial proposal in which the city would have spent $5 billion on sewage repairs, an assertion Travis has disputed.

The mayor has said costs will remain ""well below"" 2 percent of the citywide median household income, a threshold set by the EPA to measure affordability. Experts have said the guideline has been ""discredited"" because it obscures the burden on poor families.

For now, city officials are compiling options for how to structure the rate hikes, a process that Public Works Director Carol Haddock said would take until the end of the year. The proposed rate hikes will go before a council committee and include a chance for residents to weigh in publicly, Haddock said.

City council then will vote on the rate hikes, which Turner said would go into effect next April at the earliest. Houston’s water rates typically rise each April to adjust for inflation, per city ordinance.

The consent decree dictates how the city must reduce spills across its more than 6,200 miles of sewers, and details projects Houston must tackle in the first few years at its larger facilities, including 384 lift stations and 39 treatment plants.

To guide future repairs in neighborhoods that struggle with backups, the decree mandates that Houston’s entire sewer system be inspected each decade, beginning in the first two years with 1,500 miles of gravity-fed pipes typically in areas with known spill problems. The mandate also commits the city to clean all gravity pipes smaller than two feet in diameter every decade.

The citywide inspections are meant to help the city choose which items to repair first under the decree’s other mandates. They force the city each year to:

repair or replace at least 2.5 percent (today, about 150 miles) of its gravity-fed pipes and associated manholes and 5 percent (today, 18) of its lift stations, and

preventively clean at least 275 miles of gravity pipes smaller than two feet in diameter in areas with known spill problems.

The proposal also commits the city to:

come up with plans to reduce spills in nine areas where large spills occur during heavy rains, and to fix seven of them within a decade; these sites include areas near Denver Harbor, NRG Stadium, Gulfgate, Alief, the University of Houston-Downtown and near the intersection of Parker and Interstate 69.

study whether to install larger pipes anytime a pipe is scheduled for repair or replacement, and in any area where more than three spills or any spills topping 100,000 gallons were reported in the prior three years;

expand the number of “smart manholes” — which track rising water levels in the pipes to flag blockages — from 300 to 3,000 within 5 years; and

continue its program of educating the public not to pour oil, fats and grease down the drain.

Council approved the decree Wednesday despite reservations from Bayou City Waterkeeper, an environmental nonprofit that urged the city to adopt a “community engagement plan” to seek more public input before passing the agreement. The group also wants the city to support tripling the default 30-day comment period that will begin once the decree is filed in federal court; it is a legal document and does not take effect until a judge approves it.

“While a week allowed our organization a chance to review and begin to understand the decree, a week is not enough to minimally engage the residents of Houston about the way the consent decree will impact their lives — from fixing sewage pollution in neighborhoods across Houston to explaining the need for rate increases across the city,” Executive Director Jordan Macha wrote in a letter to city officials.

As part of the decree, the city also must pay $4.6 million in penalties, including attorney’s fees to the Texas attorney general’s office.

"The Justice Department’s new Big Tech investigation was announced with unusual fanfare, and some antitrust experts say it might not herald as big of a crackdown as it seems",https://www.businessinsider.com,['Troy Wolverton'],07-24-2019,2019,7,https://www.businessinsider.com/doj-unusual-antitrust-announcement-could-be-good-for-big-tech-2019-7,"The US Department of Justice's surprise press release Tuesday of its Big Tech investigation was designed to send a signal to a lot of groups — but tech companies were not really one of them.

The announcement was an unusually public performance by a federal regulator which typically prizes confidentiality in such matters. That's because it was basically a notice, intended particularly to a key figure in Congress, that the Justice Department will now be spearheading the antitrust investigations into the big tech companies, said David Balto, an antitrust lawyer in Washington D.C. with decades of experience working for and with competition regulators officials there.

For tech companies, the DOJs' announcement was if anything, a subtle indication that the government may not come down as hard on them as it might seem, he said.

""This is good news for the companies,"" Balto said.

That may seem a bit ironic, given the substance of the announcement. In its statement, the Justice Department said it would review the market power of the ""leading online platforms"" to see if they have thwarted competition or harmed consumers. The agency vowed to ""seek redress"" if it found violations, essentially threatening to sue the companies.

Read this: The Department of Justice just launched a broad probe into whether big tech companies like Amazon, Facebook, and others illegally harm competition

The announcement came as something of a surprise. Numerous reports have indicated that the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission were starting to look into the competitive practices of the big tech companies. But the agencies had declined to comment on the record for those reports. In fact, federal enforcement agencies rarely acknowledge ongoing investigations into particular people or companies.

The agency is likely responding to political pressure

Unusual as it was, the Justice Department's move didn't come out of nowhere. Political figures on the left and right, including senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders and President Donald Trump, have been calling for increased scrutiny of the market power of the big tech companies and even, in many cases, for breaking them up.

""There is enormous political pressure on the agencies in Washington to be seen as doing something about big tech,"" said Daniel Crane, a professor at the University of Michigan's law school who focuses on antitrust issues. He continued: ""This is their way of responding to the political pressure.""

But Balto thinks there something more going on. Last month, The Wall Street Journal reported that the FTC and the Justice Department had divvied up oversight over the tech giants. Under the agreement, the FTC was to get authority over Facebook and Amazon, while the Department of Justice would oversee Apple and Google parent Alphabet.

The problem with that arrangement was that Mike Lee, who serves as chairman of Senate Judiciary Committee's subcommittee on antitrust, competition policy and consumer rights, objected to it, Balto noted. In an opinion piece published by the Washington Examiner last month, Lee lambasted the idea that the agencies would split oversight duties over the big tech companies. The two agencies risked duplicating efforts and causing a divergence in enforcement, he said.

Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, questions Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh as he testifies before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Capitol Hill on September 27, 2018 in Washington, DC. Andrew Harnik, Pool/Getty Images

""These investigations will clearly cover much of the same ground,"" Lee said in his op-ed. ""Splitting antitrust investigations of these firms between two agencies,"" he continued, ""is just analytically inefficient.""

The Justice Department is saying it's in charge

Lee's subcommittee was scheduled to hold a hearing on Tuesday with top antitrust regulators in the Trump administration at which he was expected to question them over the decision to split up oversight of the tech companies. That hearing ended up being postponed, but, in Balto's view, the Justice Department's announcement was its way of responding to Lee's concerns by staking out its turf.

""This is really the (Justice Department) saying, 'thank you, it's my football, and I plan to play with it,'"" he said.

The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that the Justice Department's review would not pre-empt the investigations already underway by the FTC into the companies under its purview.

Balto says that while the Justice Department may leave some issues to the FTC, Tuesday's announcement indicates that the DOJ is laying claim to all inquiries involving online platform and marketplace issues — the core of the antitrust charges made against the big tech companies. Senator Elizabeth Warren and others have raised concerns about how those companies use their control over their platforms and marketplaces to give their own products and services a leg up over rivals.

""These issues are incredibly complex, time consuming, and really difficult, and to have two agencies looking at the same conduct really didn't make sense,"" Balto said.

Lee's office did not respond to calls or an email seeking comment. Likewise, the Justice Department did not respond to an email seeking comment.

The move could be good news for the tech giants

The news that the Justice Department was opening up its review was seen as a negative sign on Wall Street Tuesday. The big four companies' stock prices all fell following the announcement.

But having the Justice Department take point on antitrust review is actually a good thing for the tech companies, Balto said. The Department of Justice hasn't filed a major suit under the Sherman Antitrust Act since the Microsoft case two decades ago. And the agency actually has fewer legal options when it comes to policing competition than does the FTC, he said.

""I don't think anybody's going to lose any more sleep that this is all with the Justice Department,"" Balto said. ""If anything, they'll feel more comfortable in their legal position.""

For his part, Crane is dubious that anything much will come of the investigations in the near future, regardless of which agency is leading the charge. When it comes to antitrust enforcement, the FTC's track record is not much better than the Department of Justice in recent decades, despite theoretically having enhanced enforcement powers, he said.

The courts have made it difficult for regulators to win antitrust cases, and even when such cases are successful, they tend to take many years to play out. Because of that, there's little chance the big tech companies will be broken up anytime soon, despite the political pressure on them, he said.

""The kind of blockbuster, 'let's break them up' case that is being trumpeted politically, I just don't see that being in the offing,"" Crane said.

"Crackdown on food stamps could worsen hunger, USDA acknowledges",https://www.politico.com,['Helena Bottemiller Evich'],07-23-2019,2019,7,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/07/23/food-stamp-crackdown-usda-3625454,"The Trump administration's proposed rule would cut 3.1 million people from the SNAP food stamps program, saving taxpayers about $1.9 billion a year. | Justin Sullivan/Getty Images agriculture Crackdown on food stamps could worsen hunger, USDA acknowledges

The Agriculture Department acknowledged Tuesday that its latest push to cut back on who is eligible for food stamp benefits may worsen food insecurity in the U.S.

The Trump administration has just released a proposed rule seeking to rein in what's known as broad-based categorical eligibility. That policy has allowed 43 states to expand the number of low-income people who qualify for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, formerly known as food stamps.

Story Continued Below

Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said the policy is a ""loophole"" that needs to be closed because it's allowed states to bypass ""important eligibility guidelines.""

In a cost-benefit analysis, USDA estimates that tightening the policy would cut 3.1 million people from the program, saving taxpayers about $1.9 billion a year. The department also clearly states that the proposed change ""may also negatively impact food security.""

According to USDA, nearly 12 percent of U.S. households are already food insecure, which means they do not always have access to enough food as a result of a lack of resources.

The proposal is part of a broader Trump administration bid to cut federal aid programs, something conservatives have long argued is necessary as the federal deficit grows.

Broad-based categorical eligibility allows states to confer SNAP eligibility to households if they're receiving some kind of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, or TANF. The option allows states to get around the typical asset limits and expands the income limits for SNAP in some cases.

For example, the typical gross income limit for SNAP is 130 percent of the federal poverty level. That comes out to be about $27,000 for a family of three.

By using broad-based categorical eligibility, many states are able to offer SNAP benefits to households with gross income of up to 200 percent of the federal poverty level, which is about $42,000 for a family of three.

""Too often, states have misused this flexibility without restraint,” Perdue said in a statement released as part of the announcement. “The American people expect their government to be fair, efficient, and to have integrity — just as they do in their own homes, businesses, and communities.""

The department now wants to have the expanded eligibility option for states only if the household is receiving a TANF benefit such as subsidized employment, work supports or child care benefits.

USDA acknowledges that millions could lose assistance if the eligibility rule is changed, potentially worsening hunger among many low-income households.

""The proposed rule may also negatively impact food security and reduce the savings rates among those individuals who do not meet the income and resource eligibility requirements for SNAP or the substantial and ongoing requirements for expanded categorical eligibility,"" the department says in its impact analysis.

USDA estimates that about 9 percent of SNAP households would no longer qualify for the program.

The department also estimates that more than 13 percent of all SNAP households with elderly members would lose benefits.

""The proposed rule is relatively less likely to affect households with children — only 7.4 percent are expected to no longer meet eligibility requirements,"" the department said.

The plan would also hurt grocery retailers, according to USDA. The total loss in SNAP benefits would be $3 billion per year, which would be a hit to business at large and small retailers alike, the department said.

For a small retailer, the potential benefit loss might make up less than 5 percent of their typical SNAP business, USDA said.

House Republicans had sought a similar crackdown on broad-based categorical eligibility during the 2018 farm bill debate, but the changes were rejected in the final bipartisan deal.

Anti-hunger advocates and Democrats on Capitol Hill blasted the administration on Tuesday over the proposal, arguing that USDA is essentially going around Congress to enact a policy lawmakers already rejected.

""It is yet another attack on hungry Americans that ignores the clearly stated will of Congress,"" said Rep. Marcia Fudge (D-Ohio), chairwoman of the House Agriculture Nutrition Subcommittee.

""The ugly truth no one in this administration wants to admit is this: The economy isn’t working for our most vulnerable,"" Fudge added. ""They still need a hand up, not a heartless, mean-spirited policy.”"
White House nixed DHS chief McAleenan Refugee Day border welcome for migrants,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-23-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/dhs-chief-mcaleenan-wanted-to-visit-border-and-welcome-migrants-for-refugee-day-white-house-said-no,"The White House communications team and the Department of Homeland Security's acting secretary office engaged in a tense argument last month after acting Secretary Kevin McAleenan proposed traveling down to the U.S.-Mexico border on World Refugee Day to celebrate and welcome migrants, including those who entered illegally, two senior administration officials told the Washington Examiner.

A senior public affairs official at DHS asked the White House in early June for permission to go down to the southern border with Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar on June 20. One person identified the official as acting DHS Assistant Secretary of Public Affairs Andrew Meehan.

""The wildly off base proposal was met with immediate concern as not being thought through,"" one official told the Washington Examiner Monday evening.

A second official said the White House was concerned about the ""optics"" if two Cabinet officials were welcoming people who had illegally crossed into the country when President Trump has taken a hard stance against any type of illegal immigration, including against those who are seeking asylum on the southern border.

The DHS official trying to advance McAleenan's proposal refused to accept the White House's decision and ""sparred with"" several members of the White House strategic communications team, including then-director Mercedes Schlapp, over ""multiple contentious phone calls,"" the first source said. The second official said the fight lasted ""weeks.""

""The obvious glaring concern was that the border crisis was about migrants and asylums, not refugees, DHS disagreed,"" the first official wrote in a text, suggesting the the appearance would seem supportive of the people abusing the system instead of legitimate refugees.

The same official said Azar was not supportive of McAleenan's idea and was not planning to go along for the trip. The second official said Azar was on board, but added neither secretary ""understood the ramifications"" of such a trip.

The June 20 World Refugee Day celebration may not have been greenlighted but McAleenan did go to the border on that date. He flew with a Washington Post reporter on Thursday. It's not clear if Azar traveled down separately. An HHS spokeswoman would only say: ""In the past year and a half, Secretary Azar has visited numerous Office of Refugee Resettlement facilities and seen the quality of care provided to unaccompanied alien children.

DHS did not deny that McAleenan's office requested a trip on World Refugee Day and instead shared a schedule of events he took part in while on the border that day.

""On June 20, 2019, Acting Secretary McAleenan hosted the first ladies of Guatemala and Honduras for a tour of the Rio Grande Valley Border Patrol Sector,"" a DHS official wrote in an email Thursday. ""The trip included an overview of how transnational criminal and human smuggling organizations pair adult aliens with children they are not related to with the intent of posing as family units to help secure release into the U.S.""

The day after, June 21, the Washington Post published a story leaking confidential details of a nationwide Immigration and Customs Enforcement operation, which five current and former senior administration officials charged to the Washington Examiner that McAleenan leaked because he did not approve of the raids and sought to sabotage them.

""This is a DHS leadership team who has been at odds with the administration from the beginning. It’s a difference of world view,"" the first official said Monday.

The DHS Office of Inspector General has taken up the formal investigation into the leak of government information in late June, which forced ICE to call off a nationwide operation, the Washington Examiner was first to report.

The White House did not respond to a request for comment.

State Department yanks data on U.S. tourists harmed in Jamaica,https://www.freep.com,"['Tresa Baldas', 'Published A.M. Et July']",07-23-2019,2019,7,https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/detroit/2019/07/23/state-department-american-tourists-jamaica/1796973001/,"CLOSE

At a time when tourism fears have escalated in the Caribbean, the State Department has stopped publishing crime data involving Americans harmed in Jamaica — but it won't say why.

For the first time in seven years, the State Department did not list how many Americans were sexually assaulted, robbed, murdered or kidnapped in Jamaica in its 2019 Crime and Safety Report. That information was previously published in reports that were cited in a 2018 Free Press investigation, which found that sexual assaults of U.S. tourists in Jamaica is an historic and unchecked problem, with an estimated one American raped a month.

That's according to State Department data that was publicly available for seven straight years — until now.

The Free Press, which interviewed numerous U.S. victims who said they were sexually assaulted in Jamaica, including four Michigan tourists, asked the State Department multiple times why the 2019 report omits data involving American crime victims in Jamaica. The agency wouldn't explain, beyond saying: “We do not have any other information to share at this time.""

These are the choke marks that an 18-year-old South African au pair says she suffered after being drugged and raped at a Sandals-owned beaches resort in Jamaica on July 4, 2018. She says Sandals paid her American host family $25,000 and silenced them with a non-disclosure agreement (Photo: South African au pair)

But the State Department did warn in its 2019 report that ""rape and sexual assault are serious problems throughout Jamaica, including at resorts and hotels. The use of date rape drugs is possible, even at private parties and resorts.""

The Jamaica 2019 Crime and Safety Report was released in the wake of a tourism scare involving the Dominican Republic, where 10 American tourist deaths have been reported since May. Several more U.S. tourists have reported becoming severely ill while on vacation there, including a Detroit man who landed in Harper Hospital's ICU following his May vacation to the DR.

Jamaica and the Dominican Republic are among nine Caribbean and Central American destinations that the U.S. State Department has issued Level 2 travel advisories for, citing violence and crime. Level 2 means “Exercise Increased Caution.” The other countries on the Level 2 travel advisory list are: The Bahamas, Belize, Colombia, Cuba, Turks and Caicos, Mexico and Guatemala.

There are four categories of travel advisories: “Level 1: Exercise Normal Precautions”; “Level Two: Exercise Increased Caution”; “Level 3: Reconsider Travel” and “Level 4: Do Not Travel.”

Caribbean destinations that are currently deemed safe for travel — they have no travel advisory — include:

Anguilla, Antigua, Aruba, Barbados, Bonaire

British Virgin Islands

Cayman Islands

Costa Rica, Curaçao, Grenada

French West Indies, which include Guadeloupe, Martinique, French Saint Martin, and Saint Barthélemy.

Saint Kitts and Nevis

Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines

Countries on the “Level 3, Reconsider Travel” list are:

El Salvador

Honduras

Nicaragua

Haiti

Countries on the “Level 4, Do Not Travel” list are:

Venezuela

While the FBI investigates the Dominican Republic deaths, tourism officials there are working feverishly to dispel concerns about travel safety. So are officials in Jamaica, where an island-wide security audit of resorts was ordered in the wake of the Free Press investigation, which detailed the rapes of two Detroit women who were attacked at gunpoint by a Jamaican resort employee last fall.

Jamaica's Minister of Tourism Edmund Bartlett said in early July that the months-long security audit is complete and that his office is reviewing it. Findings have not yet been released.

“The issue of safety and security is very central to us. We will have further discussions with the (Jamaica Hotel and Tourist Association) as it relates to the recommendations, and together we will craft the new architecture in Jamaica,” Bartlett said at a June tourism meeting.

The audit sought to uncover, among other things, non-compliance by resorts regarding safety incidents. It focused on building safety, personnel, security measures, communication devices and security incident history.

Meanwhile, State Department warnings about sexual violence against women tourists in Jamaica continue.

""If you are a victim of a sexual assault, contact the police and the U.S. Embassy in Kingston as soon as possible,"" the State Department states in its 2019 report, reminding victims that Jamaican hotels and resorts ""should assist you with these communications.""

That message highlighted a key finding in the Free Press investigation.

Numerous victims told the Free Press the resorts ignored or downplayed their fears, discouraged them from going to the police, and in some cases silenced them with free travel in exchange for them signing non-disclosure agreements.

The 2019 State Department report also highlighted this finding by the Free Press: tourists who are sexually assaulted in Jamaica feel justice is out of reach. As one mother told the Free Press three years after her daughter was allegedly raped in a laundry room by a resort lifeguard: ""My daughter will never have justice.""

CLOSE The rapes of two Detroit women at a Jamaican resort has highlighted a pervasive problem on the island getaway: sexual assaults are ignored. Tresa Baldas, Detroit Free Press

Four and a half years after the alleged rapes of the girl and her friend, the case is finally going to trial in Jamaica in December. The victims will testify from a location in the U.S.

The State Department warns about such delays.

""Victims of sexual assault in Jamaica should not expect the same assistance routinely offered in the United States,"" the State Department writes in its 2019 report. ""Rape kits are not always available, and victims must often ask for medication to avoid STD transmission and reduce the chances of pregnancy. An offer of counseling is unlikely.""

Police resources are also limited, the government says.

""Law enforcement shortcomings exist in collection of evidence. Prosecution of rape cases moves very slowly,"" the State Department states, adding: ""Victims may need to return to Jamaica during the legal process.""

Corporations behind toxic ‘forever chemicals’ spend big as lawmakers seek to crack down,https://thinkprogress.org,[],,,,https://thinkprogress.org/pfas-forever-chemicals-toxic-dupont-3m-testify-epa-wheeler-water-d5bd441fda28/,"Manufacturers of toxic nonstick chemicals are ramping up lobbying efforts in the face of heightened lawmaker scrutiny of the products — often referred to as “forever chemicals” — which are found in a range of household items.

At least one manufacturer is set to testify before lawmakers this fall about what they knew about the damaging health risks associated with their products. And House Democrats may call other companies to testify as well. The increased attention to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, comes as manufacturers like 3M pour millions into combatting regulation of the chemicals.

Many communities have experienced devastating side effects that they link to PFAS exposure, including cancer. But for decades, the man-made class of chemicals found in everything from Teflon pans to firefighting foam has largely gone unregulated.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has controversially declined to set a maximum containment level (MCL) — or drinking water quality standard — for PFAS, even as the agency has pledged that it will act on the issue by the end of the year.

Currently, the EPA imposes a non-enforceable health advisory level of 70 parts per trillion, a standard that applies to only two types of PFAS chemicals, PFOS and PFOA, despite the growing prominence of other chemicals like GenX. Meanwhile, PFAS are increasingly appearing in water and food sources, including on farms.

During a Wednesday hearing of the House Oversight Environment Subcommittee, Chairman Harley Rouda (D-CA) criticized the companies behind PFAS, including DuPont and 3M. Both companies knew as early as the 1970s that PFOS and PFOA were toxic to humans. DuPont even tested the blood of employees for PFAS, while 3M circulated an internal memo in 1978 underscoring the toxicity of its products.

“You would think that in the United States, when we know a substance is toxic, we would take immediate action to prevent corporations from pumping those substances into our bodies and the environment,” said Rouda in opening remarks that focused largely on accountability from manufacturers.

“These corporations neglected to tell people what was in those products and, worse yet, suppressed the scientific evidence that these chemicals were hazardous,” the lawmaker emphasized.

In addition to that line of attack, Wednesday’s hearing examined the health risks associated with PFAS, along with the EPA’s controversial decision to stall efforts to regulate the chemicals — a move slammed by communities in impacted areas like New York and Pennsylvania.

“I need polluters to be held accountable,” said one witness, Sandy Wynn-Stelt from Michigan.

Her blood contains a high level of fluorochemicals linked to drinking water contaminated by a neighboring dump filled with PFAS-laden Scotchguard, a source that may also have killed her husband. Wednesday’s hearing also brought testimony from areas like Parkersburg, West Virginia, where a PFOA leak from a DuPont plant contaminated the area’s water supply for years.

Democrats indicated on Wednesday that they plan to continue pursuing corporate accountability. They announced a Sept. 10 hearing that will focus on what companies knew about PFAS’ risks and to what extent they hid that information.

In a statement, 3M said the company would testify at that hearing and would share “our perspective and research” with lawmakers. DuPont and other manufacturers have also been invited but it is not clear yet whether they will attend. Lawmakers have said they may seek to compel companies to testify if they do not agree to engage voluntarily.

As Democrats’ scrutiny grows more aggressive, corporations are boosting lobbying efforts. E&E News reported on Thursday that a lobbying boom has been sparked; 3M has spent $1.89 million in this year’s second quarter, marking a 103% increase over the same period last year.

Those expenses relate to a variety of issues but include pushing back on efforts to regulate PFAS. Chemours, a company spun off from DuPont and associated with GenX contamination in North Carolina water, has also ramped up its lobbying on “PFAS legislative proposals,” as have other manufacturers.

Such lobbying efforts are only likely to increase. Corporate accountability has become increasingly popular after successful suits against the tobacco industry, which knowingly concealed the risks associated with nicotine from the public for years. More recently, states and cities have moved to hold fossil fuel corporations like ExxonMobil responsible for hiding the dangers of climate change from the public while continuing to push their products.

And even as lawmakers move to take action on the federal level, state governments are also cracking down. Michigan, a state plagued by water crises, has indicated that it will not wait for the EPA to regulate PFAS. Instead, officials are looking into regulating certain PFAS chemicals themselves in order to protect residents.

Catherine McCabe, commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, also said on Wednesday that her state is looking to target corporations.

“New Jersey believes that the manufacturers… should be held responsible to the public for the costs and damages of the drinking water contamination and other harmful consequences of their actions and negligence,” she said."

Adam Schiff says DOJ inspector general's work is 'tainted' ahead of FISA abuse report,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-22-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/adam-schiff-says-doj-inspector-generals-work-is-tainted-ahead-of-fisa-abuse-report,"House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff said Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz got roped into a politically-motivated scheme to protect President Trump, laying the groundwork to discredit the government watchdog's work as he nears completion of a report on alleged surveillance abuses by the DOJ and FBI.

At the Aspen Security Forum this weekend, Schiff accused top Justice Department officials of pandering to Trump by instigating a ""fast track"" report last year about former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe. His comments came as part of a broader answer to a question about whether he has concerns about Attorney General William Barr's review of the origins of the Russia investigation.

Schiff claimed the president wanted McCabe, who briefly took over as acting FBI director after Trump fired James Comey in May 2017, investigated and his pension taken away and suggested someone such as former Attorney General Rod Rosenstein obliged the president by making a referral.

""The inspector general found that McCabe was untruthful. He may very well have been untruthful,"" the California Democrat said, but noted that is not where main his concern lies.

""I have no reason to question the inspector general's conclusion, but that investigation was put on a fast track. It was separated from a broader inspector general investigation, which is still ongoing,"" he said. ""Why was that done? It was done so he could be fired to not get a pension. It was done to please the president when the initiation investigation is tainted. So are the results of that investigation.""

McCabe was fired from the FBI on March 16, 2018, less than two days before he planned to retire on his 50th birthday and collect a full pension, after the Justice Department's Office of the Inspector General determined he misled investigators about the role he had in leaking information to the Wall Street Journal in October 2016 about the investigation into the Clinton Foundation.

In April 2018, it was revealed that the Justice Department inspector general referred its findings to the U.S. attorney’s office in Washington for possible criminal charges, and his lawyer confirmed as recently as February that McCabe was still under investigation.

McCabe, whom Trump has accused of planning to carry out an ""illegal and treasonous"" plan to oust him as president, has argued that his firing was an attempt to discredit the FBI and special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.

The initiation of the inspector general's inquiry in McCabe happened, Schiff said, ""because the president wanted it politically."" He added, ""Once you go down that road, it leads to disaster.""

Horowitz is nearing the end of another investigation that Trump and his allies are eagerly anticipating. The inspector general announced his investigation into whether the FBI and Justice Department filing of four FISA applications and renewals to surveil former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page was an abuse of the FISA process in March 2018, following requests by then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions and members of Congress. House Judiciary Committee ranking member Doug Collins said he expects the inspector general's report to be released this fall after some delays.

This matters because now that Mueller's work is complete, Barr's ""investigation into the investigators"" is underway, and the attorney general has said he is working very closely with Horowitz. The inspector general can recommend prosecutions, and U.S. Attorney John Durham, whom Barr tasked to lead the review, has the ability to convene a grand jury and subpoena people outside of the government. Beyond that, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, a close Trump ally, has promised a ""deep dive"" into the origins of the Trump-Russia investigation after Horowitz completes his work.

Wary of the churning cycle of investigations, Schiff tied Horowitz to Barr, saying, ""this is tainted from the start because it is motivated for a political end and the damage it will do in terms of a chilling impact is of deep concern, um, the damage it will do in terms of trying to cast doubt on things that are not in doubt.""

The question Schiff was asked by and audience member focused on whether he was concerned about how Durham's team reportedly wanted to talk to at least one senior CIA counterintelligence official and a senior CIA analyst who examined Russia's role in meddling in the 2016 election.

He said the inquiries that question ""well substantiated conclusions to essentially politicize the intelligence process and tell analysts that the work will be scrutinized with a political perspective if it runs contrary to the desires of the president. That's a terrible, terrible precedent."""
"Brooklyn man accused of immigration fraud, submitting hundreds of faked applications: DOJ",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Bradford Betz', 'Bradford Betz Is An Editor For Fox News. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/brooklyn-man-accused-of-immigration-fraud-submitting-hundreds-of-faked-applications-doj,"A New York City man was arrested Tuesday for allegedly running an immigration fraud scheme that involved filing over 1,800 fake immigration applications over the past four years, according to a press release from the Department of Justice’s office in Vermont.

Brooklyn resident Arleigh Louison, 53, was arrested by Diplomatic Security Service (DSS) agents who executed a federal search warrant at his office, the press release said.

Louison’s arrest comes less than a week after a federal grand jury returned a 12-count indictment, charging him with presenting false adjustment of status petitions to the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services Service Center in St. Albans, Vt.

The Office of the United States Attorney for the District of Vermont, which conducted the probe, said Louison made false statements in connection with Form I-360 petitions for status adjustments under the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), a law that enables immigrants to become lawful permanent residents (LPRs) of the U.S. if they were abused by a relative who is a U.S. citizen or LPR.

Louison allegedly submitted false information in the VAWA petitions so petitioners could secure work authorization permits. Last week’s indictment charged that the petitioners – who paid Louison for his services – were not abused as described in the petitions and never discussed abuse with Louison.

The U.S. Attorney’s Office in Vermont said that Louison filed false statements with the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, including more than 1,800 fraudulent applications for over 1,000 petitioners in the last four years.

Louison was scheduled to appear in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York later on Tuesday, according to the press release.

Gay American couple sues State Department over daughter's citizenship,https://thehill.com,[],07-23-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/454372-gay-american-parents-sue-over-citizenship-of-their-daughter,"A gay U.S. couple is reportedly suing Secretary of State Mike Pompeo Michael (Mike) Richard PompeoPompeo's controversial plan to make human rights 'great again' Technology companies press Trump as Huawei deadline nears Gay American couple sues State Department over daughter's citizenship MORE for discrimination after the State Department denied citizenship to their daughter, who was born in the U.K. with help of a surrogate.

The New York Times reported that James Derek Mize and his husband Jonathan Gregg filed a lawsuit Tuesday after their daughter, Simone, was denied citizenship even though both of her parents are American citizens.

Simone was born in the U.K. last year using the donor egg of a British friend and Gregg’s sperm. She was reportedly denied citizenship when the family submitted an application after returning home to the U.S. Her tourist visa will expire at the end of July. ADVERTISEMENT

“I try not to think about ICE coming to our door and deporting our baby,” Mize told the Times, referring to Immigration and Customs Enforcement. “That is a pretty hard thing to think about.”

The State Department has a policy requiring that children born abroad through assisted reproductive technology and surrogacy must show biological parentage in order to obtain citizenship.

At least two other same-sex couples are suing the agency for similar reasons and nearly 100 congressional Democrats last month urged Pompeo to reverse the “cruel” policy, according to the Times.

The State Department told The Hill it would not comment on ongoing litigation.

The Times reported that in court documents the department has argueed that the policy does not discriminate and applies to opposite-sex and same-sex couples alike.

Under the State Department policy, cases where the source of the sperm and egg do not match married parents are treated as “out of wedlock” and require a higher bar to transmit citizenship, the Times reported.

Gregg, a U.K.-born citizen to an American mother, does not meet the five-year U.S. residency requirement, but the newspaper said the couples’ lawyers argue that would not matter if the couple had been treated as married.

Under the Obama administration, after same-sex marriage was legalized, the State Department policy was adjusted, according to the Times, so that biological connection could be tied to supplying the egg or the sperm as well as giving birth to a child, allowing same-sex couples to have a child “in wedlock.”

But under the Trump administration, the State Department is fighting the lawsuits in courts in what critics are saying is discrimination against same-sex parents."
Trump’s DOJ Brings Back Capital Punishment,http://nymag.com,['Adam K. Raymond'],07-25-2019,2019,7,http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/07/trumps-doj-brings-back-capital-punishment.html,"The execution chamber in the federal prison in Terre Haute, Indiana. Photo: Scott Olson/Getty Images

After nearly two decades without an execution, the federal government will put five people to death in December and January, the Justice Department announced on Thursday.

The DOJ also announced a change to the execution process. The traditional three-drug cocktail used for lethal injections with be replaced with the single drug pentobarbital. A handful of states have made a similar move after sodium thiopental, one of the three drugs used in the cocktail, became difficult to obtain after foreign manufacturers refused to sell it for use in executions.

In a statement, Attorney General William Barr said, “We owe it to the victims and their families to carry forward the sentence imposed by our justice system.”

The DOJ announcement marks an end to an unofficial moratorium on federal executions. The death penalty is legal in 29 states, which execute around two dozen people each year. But the federal government hasn’t executed anyone since 2003 and has only put three people to death since 1976. The five inmates whose executions have been scheduled for December and January have “exhausted their appellate and post-conviction remedies,” according to the Justice Department. All have been “convicted of murdering, and in some cases torturing and raping, the most vulnerable in our society — children and the elderly.”

While it’s been nearly two decades since a federal inmate was executed, people were still sentenced to death during that time. In the past decade, death sentences were handed down to high-profile inmates such as Dylann Roof and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev.

But the number of federal death-penalty cases has increased under President Trump, a vocal fan of capital punishment. In 1989, he placed an ad in four New York City newspapers calling for the execution of the Central Park Five, who were later exonerated.

In 1989, Trump bought this ad to inflame public sentiment against teens known as the Central Park Five, who were later exonerated by DNA evidence.

Trumps’ potential 2020 rivals, meanwhile, have swung in the other direction. Just this week, Joe Biden came out against the death penalty, meaning every top 2020 Democratic favors its abolition."
