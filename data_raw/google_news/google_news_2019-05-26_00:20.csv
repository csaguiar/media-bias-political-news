"Brennan, Clapper lash out at Trump for declassifying 2016 election intel",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Joseph Wulfsohn', 'Joseph A. Wulfsohn Is A Media Reporter For Fox News. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/brennan-clapper-trump-declassifying-surveillance,"Former CIA Director John Brennan and former DNI James Clapper blasted President Trump on Friday night for directing Attorney General William Barr to declassify documents related to the surveillance of his campaign during the 2016 election, calling it ""outrageous.""

""I see it as a very, very serious and outrageous move on the part of Mr. Trump, once again, trampling on the statutory authorities of the Director of National Intelligence and the heads of the independent intelligence agencies,"" Brennan told MSNBC host Chris Hayes. ""And it's unclear to me what Mr. Barr is actually going to do. Is he investigating a crime? Well, what's the predication of that crime? Or he is just going to be looking for information... that Mr. Trump can just give to his defenders on the right and cherry-pick information that could be taken out of context?""

TRUMP VOWS TO UNCOVER RUSSIA PROBE ROOTS WITH DECLASSIFICATION CALL: 'WE'RE EXPOSING EVERYTHING'

Brennan expressed concern about exposing ""sources and methods"" as well as the intelligence of ""partners abroad.""

""This is very serious and I know that my former colleagues in the intelligence agencies are looking upon this with great concern and worry,"" the former top Obama official stated.

He later said he hopes that DNI Dan Coats and CIA Director Gina Haspel will ""stand up"" to President Trump's ""unprecedented act.""

Brennan slammed President Trump on Twitter after the president shared a political cartoon mocking the former CIA Director, former DNI Clapper, and FBI Director James Comey.

TRUMP GIVES AG BARR AUTHORITY TO DECLASSIFY DOCUMENTS RELATED TO 2016 CAMPAIGN SURVEILLANCE

""Young people everywhere: Please do not emulate Mr. Trump’s very immature behavior. Find others of honesty, integrity, & decency to be your role models,"" the MSNBC analyst tweeted. ""And always try to do what you know is the right thing, even when doing what is right is both unpopular & difficult.""

Meanwhile, Clapper told CNN's Anderson Cooper that the ""bigger issue"" is ""what exactly is the scope"" of the declassification, whether it involves all of Russia's interference in the election or just the counter-intelligence probe. He expressed similar concerns as Brennan regarding sources and methods being exposed and putting ""people's lives at risk.""

Federal judge who blocked Trump's border wall donated $20K to Obama,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-25-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/courts/federal-judge-who-blocked-trumps-border-wall-donated-20k-to-obama,"A federal judge who partially blocked President Trump’s plans to build a border wall along the United States-Mexico border previously donated almost $30,000 to former President Obama, other Democrats, and a political action committee.

U.S. District Court Judge Haywood Gilliam, an Obama appointee confirmed in 2014, donated $6,900 to Barack Obama’s debut campaign for president and $14,500 to his reelection campaign, according to federal election records. The same records also indicate he contributed $4,500 to the Democratic National Committee in 2012 and, between 2012 and 2015, sent $3,100 to the Covington Burling LLP PAC, which supports candidates from both parties. His contributions totaled $29,000.

Gilliam made the donations, first reported by the Epoch Times, prior to serving as a U.S. District judge. He had said during his confirmation hearing that he “would base my decisions solely on the facts of each case and the applicable precedent, without regard to any political ideology or motivation,” and that “any personal views would not interfere in any way with my ability to neutrally apply the law.”

Gilliam is one of three federal judges who have donated to Democratic candidates in the past and recently ruled against the Trump administration.

U.S. District Judge Edgardo Ramos and U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta, both Obama appointees, ruled to release Trump’s financial documents demanded by Democratic subpoenas as investigations into President Trump continue in the wake of special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation. U.S. Attorney General William Barr’s summary of the Mueller report stated that while it “does not conclude that the president committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him,” and Democrats have insisted the report provides a basis for further investigations into the Trump campaign.

Ramos, who ruled that Deutsche Bank and Capital One can provide House Democrats with Trump’s financial records, donated $4,025 to Obama’s 2008 campaign for president, and also contributed $1,000 his then rival, Hillary Clinton. He made further donations to other Democrats, such as Rep. Jim Himes, D-Conn., and Rep. Nydia Velazquez, D-N.Y., who serve on the House Financial Services and Intelligence committees. Ramos does not appear to have made political donations since being appointed to the federal court in 2011.

Mehta, who ruled against blocking a congressional committee’s subpoena of Mazars USA, Trump’s accounting firm, also donated $1,000 to Obama’s first campaign and doubled his donation for the former president’s reelection bid. Mehta also appeared to stop political donations after his 2014 federal appointment."
CNN's Jim Acosta claims Trump was just engaging in an 'act' when he called him 'fake news',https://www.foxnews.com,"['Sam Dorman', 'Sam Dorman Is A Reporter With Fox News. You Can Follow Him On Facebook']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/cnn-jim-acosta-book-trump-fake-news-act,"CNN reporter Jim Acosta suggests in his new book that President Trump didn't take the ""fake news"" accusation seriously at the beginning of his presidency.

In his book ""The Enemy of the People,"" slated for release on June 11, Acosta recalls getting a phone call from then-White House communications director Hope Hicks who said the president wanted her to tell Acosta he was ""very professional"" after the two had a testy exchange in which the president called Acosta ""fake news.""

The exchange happened during a press conference in February of 2017, according to an extract of the book obtained by The Guardian. Based on Acosta's account, it seemed as though Hicks indicated Acosta understood the subtext of their exchange that day.

“He said, ‘Jim gets it’,” Acosta claims Hicks said of Trump.

“When he called us ‘fake news’, it was, in his mind, an act,"" Acosta writes.

Acosta's book comes after a long line of confrontations between him and the president, who has often referred to CNN as ""fake news.""

CNN'S ACOSTA SUGGESTS TRUMP ORDERED UNSEALING OF 2016 INTEL TO 'DISTRACT' FROM PELOSI SPAT

Acosta has also received criticism from people outside the administration, suggesting that he was grandstanding during press conferences -- something the CNN reporter admits to in his book. He also suggests that bias is OK in the age of Trump.

“Neutrality for the sake of neutrality doesn’t really serve us in the age of Trump,"" he said.

Amid his book release, Acosta seemed to face criticism from within his own network.

“Jim Acosta is, a lot of times, asking the right questions but it doesn’t always need to be about him and his grandstanding,” a CNN staffer told Fox News.

“People get tired of it. Acosta is supposed to be a correspondent reporting the facts but you can’t tell the difference between him and a paid pundit.”

MSNBC'S CHUCK TODD RIPS TRUMP: 'HE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW THE DEFINITION OF TREASON'

Another White House reporter suggested to Fox News that Acosta's actions had unintended consequences for the rest of the press corps.

""I support reporters — even irredeemably biased ones — having access to the White House. But Acosta should consider how his behavior affects the rest of the press corps, who are there to be taken seriously and report the news rather than to boost their own celebrity,"" the reporter said.

One particular incident cost Acosta his press pass after White House press secretary Sarah Sanders accused him of placing his hands on a White House intern who was trying to take the microphone from him.

Acosta reportedly called that accusation a ""disgusting smear"" and said of the incident, ""everything in my life began to spiral out of control."" But despite Acosta's criticism of Sanders in the book, he also said she would get drinks with him and others. Sanders, he said, could “throw back her Maker’s and Coke with the best of them.""

Trump’s Targeting of Intelligence Agencies Gains a Harder Edge,https://www.nytimes.com,"['Michael S. Schmidt', 'Julian E. Barnes']",05-25-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/25/us/politics/trump-intelligence-agencies.html,"Mr. Barr has not made his motivation clear. But in three months as attorney general, he has aligned himself with the president’s dim view of the inquiry. He declined to knock down the notion that the Russia investigation was a witch hunt, described investigative efforts into the Trump campaign as “spying” and begun the multiagency review into the roots of the investigation. Mr. Barr decided that there was insufficient evidence to prosecute Mr. Trump for obstruction of justice, a decision that the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, declined to make.

Mr. Barr served as a driving force in securing the power to declassify government secrets, and the lead-up to Thursday’s announcement demonstrated an amount of planning that went beyond previous similar forays by Mr. Trump and his aides. In July, when they announced that they planned to take away the security clearance of the former F.B.I. director James B. Comey, they had not done the homework to discover he no longer had one.

Mr. Barr asked for the White House to grant him additional, far-reaching powers for his review, according to two administration officials. The White House counsel, Pat Cipollone, who was an assistant to Mr. Barr during his first stint as attorney general under President George Bush in the early 1990s, oversaw the effort to grant Mr. Barr’s request, the officials said.

And though the White House was ready last week to release the memo outlining his new powers, Mr. Barr asked for the White House to wait until he had taken care of outstanding business, including telling the heads of all the relevant intelligence agencies about the coming change.

When the White House released the memo on Thursday evening, it landed with authority and a presentation that signaled a concerted effort unlike Mr. Trump’s tweets or stream-of-consciousness comments to reporters. The document was written in legalese and issued as a memorandum on White House letterhead.

For Democrats, Mr. Barr’s newfound powers served as a sign that Mr. Trump had found a new, and potentially effective, tool in his war on the so-called deep state.

“This is a president who will lash out and destroy anything if he believes it will suit his interests,” said Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California and the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. “And he now has a capable lieutenant in the attorney general to help him do just that.”"
MSNBC's Wallace alters video of herself to show how Trump tried to 'smear' Pelosi,https://thehill.com,[],05-25-2019,2019,5,https://thehill.com/homenews/media/445536-msnbcs-wallace-doctors-video-of-herself-showing-how-trump-tried-to-smear,"MSNBC's Nicolle Wallace on Friday showed an altered video clip of herself to blast President Trump Donald John TrumpA better VA, with mental health services, is essential for America's veterans Pelosi, Nadler tangle on impeachment, contempt vote Trump arrives in Japan to kick off 4-day state visit MORE’s attempt to ""smear"" Speaker Nancy Pelosi Nancy PelosiPelosi, Nadler tangle on impeachment, contempt vote Hillary Clinton slams Trump for spreading 'sexist trash' about Pelosi Hillicon Valley: Facebook won't remove doctored Pelosi video | Trump denies knowledge of fake Pelosi videos | Controversy over new Assange charges | House Democrats seek bipartisan group on net neutrality MORE (D-Calif.) with an edited video.

The “Deadline: White House” host said on her show that the clash between Trump and Pelosi this week has “deteriorated to a level beneath words — comprehensible words at least.”

“That’s why we’re going to do something different here to make sure you understand just how low the president has stooped in his efforts to smear the Speaker of the House,” Wallace said.

""We believe that transparency is the best disinfectant for dirty politics, so we’re going to break down what the president of the United States did to the Speaker of the House when he shared a doctored video of her with his millions of Twitter followers,"" she added.

Wallace, who served as White House communications director in the George W. Bush administration and as a GOP campaign aide, noted that Trump had shared an edited video clip Thursday that made it seem like Pelosi was stuttering.

The video, while itself not doctored, was shared the same day The Washington Post reported that videos doctored to make Pelosi appear to be slurring her words as if she were drunk had gone viral on social media.

Trump shared a video from Fox Business Network that had been edited to combine clips of Pelosi tripping over her words in a press conference. Trump tweeted the clip with the caption ""PELOSI STAMMERS THROUGH NEWS CONFERENCE.""

Wallace noted that the slowed-down video ""has the effect of making anyone look like they’re having a hard time speaking.""

The MSNBC host proceeded to air a clip of her speaking that had been slowed down so her audience could see what she looked and sounded like doctored.

She also pointed out that Trump has been a victim of doctored videos himself, playing a clip that showed a campaign speech that had been altered.

Wallace said her MSNBC show had decided not to show the clip of Pelosi that Trump shared with his 60.5 million Twitter followers.

The president on Friday denied knowledge of the altered videos and praised his ability to work with the Democratic leader before accusing her of ""not helping the country.""

""I don’t know about the videos. I can tell you that — what I’m here is to help the country,"" Trump told reporters at the White House before leaving on a trip to Japan."
"Trump, in Japan, says Tokyo has ‘substantial’ trade advantage over US",https://www.foxnews.com,['Adam Shaw'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-in-japan-says-tokyo-has-substantial-trade-advantage-over-the-us,"President Trump on Saturday started his four-day visit to Japan by declaring that Tokyo has a “substantial” trade advantage over the U.S. -- and that he hopes a future trade agreement will rebalance the situation.

Trump, speaking to businessmen at the U.S. ambassador's residence, hailed the U.S.-Japanese relationship. He said that the countries are “working together to promote mutually beneficial investment.” and that they are working on a bilateral trade deal.

JAPAN WELCOMES TRUMP WITH A CHARM CAMPAIGN, GOLF AND SUMO

“I would say that Japan has had a substantial edge for many, many years but that's OK,” he said. “Maybe that's why you like me so much.

“But we'll get it a little bit more fair,” he added. “I think we'll do that.”

Trump has made rebalancing trading relationships, particularly with China and the European Union, a priority of his administration. He has threatened Japan with tariffs on automobiles and auto parts if Japan does not give ground to the U.S. in talks.

In his speech, he said that he hopes the deal will address the imbalance by removing barriers to U.S. exports and ensuring “fairness and reciprocity” in the U.S.-Japanese relationship. He struck an optimistic note about negotiations, though, and said that “we’re getting close.”

“Just last week, U.S. beef exports gained full access to Japan and to the markets in Japan for the first time since the year 2000,” he said. “We welcome your support for these efforts and we hope to have several further announcements soon and some very big ones over the next few months.”

As part of that push, he told business leaders that there’s “never been a better time to invest and do business in the United States.”

“Last year for the first time in a decade the United States was ranked the most competitive economy anywhere in the world,” he said, before taking a swipe at the Federal Reserve. “During that year our economy grew. At three percent. And if the Fed didn't raise interest rates frankly it would have been much higher than 3 percent.“

He went on to tout his administration’s efforts to cut red tape and the strength of U.S. labor markets as he sought to sell the U.S. to potential investors. He told the audience that the U.S.-Japanese relationship ""has never been more powerful, never been closer.""

“If you join in seizing the incredible opportunities now before us in terms of investments in the United States, I think you're going to see a tremendous return on your investments,” he said.

Trump will become the first head of state to meet Emperor Naruhito on Monday. He will also play golf and attend a sumo wrestling championship match during his visit.

Also on the table is North Korea. National Security Adviser John Bolton said that Trump will talk with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe about “making sure the integrity of the Security Council resolutions are maintained.""

Potential Clash Over Secrets Looms Between Justice Dept. and C.I.A.,https://www.nytimes.com,"['Julian E. Barnes', 'David E. Sanger']",05-24-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/24/us/politics/trump-barr-declassify-intelligence.html,"The intelligence agencies already have a degree of unease over the Justice Department’s ability to keep the identity of sources secret. The name of the F.B.I. informant involved in the initial investigation of the Trump campaign’s contacts with Russia was inadvertently made public.

“If you compromise agents, lives can be lost. That is why this is so sensitive,” Senator Angus King, the Maine independent who is a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said in an interview. “It is important to be exceedingly careful in this area. That is my only concern, and I hope Mr. Barr realizes that.”

Mr. Barr asked Mr. Trump for the declassification authority, a Justice Department official said on Thursday. He has not detailed the information he is seeking, but some officials have said he is interested in how the C.I.A. concluded Mr. Putin ordered the interference campaign in 2016.

The most prominent of the C.I.A.’s sources of intelligence on Russia’s election interference was a person close to Mr. Putin who provided information about his involvement, former officials have said. The source turned over evidence for one of the last major intelligence conclusions that President Barack Obama made public before leaving office: that Mr. Putin himself was behind the Russia hack.

Long nurtured by the C.I.A., the source rose to a position that enabled the informant to provide key information in 2016 about the Russian leadership’s role in the interference campaign, the officials said.

John O. Brennan, the C.I.A. director under Mr. Obama, would bring reports from the source directly to the White House, keeping them out of the president’s daily intelligence briefing for fear that the briefing document was too widely disseminated, according to the officials. Instead, he would place them in an envelope for Mr. Obama and a tiny circle of aides to read.

But Mr. Trump’s promise to declassify a broad swath of documents suggests that Mr. Barr’s mandate is more extensive than investigating any single source. Mr. Trump’s comments mentioning Britain and Australia appeared to be a reference to the F.B.I.’s investigation of George Papadopoulos, a former Trump campaign aide."
Mark Meadows views fresh 'Strzok coverup' material at DOJ,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-24-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/mark-meadows-views-fresh-strzok-coverup-material-at-doj,"Rep. Mark Meadows said he was at the Justice Department to review new information about former FBI agent Peter Strzok.

The North Carolina Republican was spotted at Justice Department headquarters in D.C. with Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, on Thursday.

Asked by a reporter why he was there, Meadows said, ""I was reviewing text messages and new correspondence that pertains to the Strzok coverup.""

Hours after their visit, President Trump gave Attorney General William Barr ""full and complete authority to declassify information"" related to the origins of the federal investigation into possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia.

Meadows and Jordan's visit to the Justice Department also comes after House Intelligence Committee ranking member Devin Nunes said he learned that an August 2016 text from Strzok about an ""insurance policy"" had to do with the FBI's use of an unverified dossier compiled by British ex-spy Christopher Steele to obtain Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrants to wiretap Trump campaign adviser Carter Page.

Strzok was the lead investigator of the Hillary Clinton emails inquiry and opened the counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia in the summer of 2016.

Text messages between Strzok and former FBI lawyer Lisa Page, in which they displayed a negative opinion of Trump, were uncovered over the course of the Justice Department's inspector general investigation into the DOJ and FBI's conduct during the investigation into Hillary Clinton's unauthorized private email server.

The report, which came out in the summer of 2018, said their text messages ""potentially indicated or created the appearance that investigative decisions were impacted by bias or improper considerations. But the inspector general determined that there was no evidence “improper considerations, including political bias, directly affected the specific investigative decisions.""

Both Strzok and Lisa Page, who are no longer with the FBI, have been a focus of GOP investigators concerned about potential bias within the Justice Department and FBI."

WASHINGTON — Newly released emails show that Environmental Protection Agency scientists raised strong objections to a 2018 decision by Scott Pruitt, who was head of the agency at the time, to exempt most of southeastern Wisconsin from federal limits on smog.

The decision by Mr. Pruitt was notable because it came as Gov. Scott Walker, a Republican, was campaigning for a third term and trying to bring a Foxconn factory, and thousands of new manufacturing jobs, to a part of the state where pollution levels already exceeded federal limits.

Mr. Walker ultimately lost his re-election bid to Tony Evers, a Democrat. And Foxconn , the Taiwanese consumer electronics giant, announced in January that it was reconsidering its plan to build a $10 billion plant in Wisconsin, though the company later said it would build a smaller factory in the state.

But, in spring 2018, as the governor’s race was heating up, Mr. Walker championed the Foxconn deal and the 13,000 jobs it promised to create. The factory, however, also threatened to create a new source of pollution in the region."

USDA staffers quit en masse as Trump administration eyes moving offices out of DC,https://www.foxnews.com,"[""Andrew O'Reilly""]",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/usda-staffers-quit-en-masse-as-trump-administration-eyes-moving-offices-out-of-dc,"Employees at the U.S. Department of Agriculture are quitting at a rapid clip as Secretary Sonny Perdue prepares to move forward with plans to relocate two offices far outside the Washington, D.C., Beltway.

Federal employees at the Economic Research Service (ERS) and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) – two small but important agencies within the USDA – are unhappy with Perdue’s plan, announced last August, to move the majority of their staff from current offices in the capital to an area closer the country’s agricultural centers.

“This move does not serve a public purpose,” Peter Winch, a representative for the American Federation of Government Employees, a union that represents ERS workers, told Fox News. “Employees don’t want to move, and it doesn’t make sense for them to move.”

US FARMERS HURT BY TRADE WAR GETTING $16 BILLION BOOST, US AGRICULTURE SECRETARY SAYS

Winch added that since ERS employees joined AFGE earlier this month, six employees have already quit their jobs with the government agency in response to the planned move. He said overall staffing is down to 209 from 300 during the Obama administration.

A Washington Post report cited an estimate that the ERS used to see roughly one “non-retirement” departure per month – but that pace has doubled since October. NIFA reportedly has also seen people leave.

Perdue said in a statement to Fox News that the move was meant “to improve performance and the services these agencies provide.” The secretary of agriculture added that the planned move would bring the department’s scientists closer to “stakeholders” and “customers” such as Midwest farmers.

“It’s been our goal to make USDA the most effective, efficient, and customer-focused department in the entire federal government,” Perdue said. “We don’t undertake these relocations lightly, and we are doing it to improve performance and the services these agencies provide.”

Perdue added: “We will be placing important USDA resources closer to many stakeholders, most of whom live and work far from Washington, D.C. We will be saving money for the taxpayers and improving our ability to retain more employees in the long run.”

The goal of the ERS, however, is to provide statistical information to lawmakers in Washington, while NIFA works to fund hundreds of millions of dollar annually in research in the agricultural sector.

HISTORIC FLOODS IN MIDWEST HAVE FARMERS WORRIED ABOUT THEIR FUTURE

Congressional Democrats are scrambling to try and block the move.

“This parochial idea of, like, ‘Washington messes everything up. Let’s move it out of town’ overlooks the important role that this agency plays,” Rep. Chellie Pingree, D-Maine, a member of the House Agriculture Committee, told The Washington Post. “There’s just a heightened level of concern about this administration, generally, about data collection and science.”

Critics, including former USDA officials, say the move would weaken the agencies, reduce their influence with lawmakers and provide little benefit to the farming community.

Winch argued that weakening the agencies' influence in Washington is at least part of the point. The NIFA funds grants that go into researching the effects the agriculture sector has on climate change – which the Trump administration has tried to downplay – and Perdue was allegedly upset by NIFA’s policy to support LGBT members of the 4-H youth farming organization.

The president’s 2020 budget has also proposed slashing funding to ERS research from $87 million to $61 million and cutting 160 jobs, while Perdue has suggested moving the agency from under the USDA’s science arm to being supervised by the USDA’s chief economist, a political wing of the department.

“There is some sort of punitive motivation,” Winch said. “Someone has made a negative judgment about these agencies.”

Perdue and his staff have narrowed the list of places where the two agencies could go down to three from an original 130 -- with Kansas City, the state of Indiana and North Carolina’s research triangle in the Raleigh-Durham area on the shortlist. St. Louis, Mo., and Madison, Wis., are two alternate locations.

Perdue is expected to make the announcement of where the agencies will move as soon as Friday, but it remains unclear whether the two agencies will actually leave Washington.

The USDA’s own inspector general is currently looking into whether Perdue has the legal authority to move these agencies, while the House Appropriations Committee’s draft bill of agricultural appropriations, which was released earlier this week, prohibits the USDA from using funds to move agencies outside of the Washington area. Trump’s 2020 budget proposal wants $15.5 million to relocate ERS and $9.5 million to relocate NIFA.

“We continue to believe that the USDA lacks the legal authority to carry out this proposal,” Rep. Steny H. Hoyer, D-Md., and Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton, D-D.C., said in a statement earlier this spring. “However, even if it had such authority, USDA has not done the proper analysis of the cost and benefits, and this proposal will harm agriculture research and our constituents.”"
Trump to place Ken Cuccinelli at the head of the country’s legal immigration system,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Nick Miroff', 'Reporter Covering Immigration Enforcement', 'Drug Trafficking', 'National Security', 'Josh Dawsey', 'Reporter Covering The White House', 'Maria Sacchetti', 'Reporter Covering Immigrant Communities', 'Immigration', 'Customs Enforcement']",05-24-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/trump-to-place-ken-cuccinelli-at-the-head-of-the-countrys-legal-immigration-system/2019/05/24/143fdec8-7e64-11e9-a5b3-34f3edf1351e_story.html,"President Trump plans to install Ken Cuccinelli II as the new director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, placing the conservative activist and former Virginia attorney general at the head of the agency that runs the country’s legal immigration system, administration officials said Friday.

L. Francis Cissna, the agency’s current director, has told his staff that he will leave his post June 1.

The move extends the purge of senior leadership at the Department of Homeland Security, replacing Cissna, a Senate-confirmed agency head with deep expertise on immigration law, with Cuccinelli, a conservative firebrand disliked by senior GOP figures, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.).

McConnell has vowed to block Cuccinelli from getting confirmed for any position, blaming him for leading a 2014 effort defying McConnell that promoted insurgent candidates running against sitting Republican incumbents. And Cuccinelli signed a letter drafted by conservative activists two years ago calling on McConnell to step aside.

After Cuccinelli was rumored as a potential DHS secretary, McConnell told reporters he had communicated with the White House about his opposition.

“I have expressed my, shall I say, lack of enthusiasm for one of them . . . Ken Cuccinelli,” McConnell said.

Cuccinelli, known more recently for combative television appearances and enthusiasm for the president’s immigration proposals, is even more disliked by Democrats.

Trump senior policy adviser Stephen Miller has been agitating for Cissna’s removal for months, and he has repeatedly railed about Cissna to the president, saying he is not in favor of the administration’s agenda and has delayed some of its biggest initiatives — while not writing enough regulations.

Miller also faulted Cissna for moving too slowly in implementing new rules that would penalize immigrants who use public benefits, expanding the agency’s ability to deny visas on the grounds that an applicant could be considered a “public charge.” The proposed changes triggered more than 200,000 public comments, all requiring a response from the agency.

Cuccinelli’s new role could include other duties outside of CIS, an administration official said Friday.

[Cuccinelli, a righteous, faith-driven warrior who delights in provocation, will join Trump administration]

Miller agitated to have Cissna fired during the last DHS purge, officials said, but a number of Republican senators — including Sen. Charles E. Grassley (Iowa) — rallied to Cissna’s defense. A senior White House official who spoke on the condition of anonymity said Cissna was temporarily saved after Trump saw how many influential Republicans, and even hard-line immigration hawks, were praising him.

But the reprieve was short-lived, and Trump’s decision to add Cuccinelli to the department earlier this week set up potential conflicts within DHS leadership, where there was no clear vacancy for him.

White House aides have scrambled to figure out exactly what Cuccinelli would be doing in the administration, officials said, and the move Friday places him at the forefront of Trump’s plans to overhaul the country’s legal immigration system.

Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law, is leading a White House effort to reorient the agency toward a “merit-based” immigration system that will prioritize job skills over the current family reunification model, which the president denounces as “chain migration.”

Cissna, the son of an immigrant mother from Peru, is a bespectacled career bureaucrat who quotes classics and is fluent in Spanish. He fits in well with academics and policy wonks, and he prioritizes following immigration law to the letter.

His relationship with Miller has long been frosty — at one point in a conference call during a debate over asylum laws in 2018, Cissna said “Enough!” to Miller, who he believed was pressuring government officials to ignore immigration laws.

Cissna’s supporters — including immigration hard-liners — say he actually had more success than his border enforcement peers at Homeland Security in implementing the Trump administration’s agenda. He heightened scrutiny of legal immigration applications while continuing to naturalize thousands of lawful immigrants.

But immigration lawyers and Democrats have criticized Cissna for throwing sand in the gears of the nation’s legal immigration system. In February, lawmakers wrote to Cissna saying processing delays in the agency had reached “crisis levels” that were preventing relatives of U.S. citizens and others from working legally and paying their bills. Among the green card and visa applicants are domestic-abuse survivors, children and others, they said.

Cissna also generated controversy last year by removing the phrase “nation of immigrants” from the USCIS mission statement.

In a farewell letter to staff Friday, obtained by The Washington Post, Cissna said he submitted his resignation “at the request of the President.”

“It gives me great pride to reflect upon the many strides we have made in a relatively short period of time to carry out our statutory mission and ensure that you’re appropriately trained and empowered to carry out your individual duties and responsibilities under the law,” Cissna wrote. “I also know we have carefully and purposefully laid the groundwork for many more, much-needed, lawful reforms to come in the near future.”"
"Corey Lewandowski predicts criminal referrals for former FBI officials including Comey, McCabe",https://www.washingtontimes.com,"['The Washington Times Http', 'Andrew Blake']",05-24-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/may/24/corey-lewandowski-predicts-criminal-referrals-for-/,"Corey Lewandowski, President Trump’s former campaign manager, anticipates criminal proceedings being initiated soon against several former FBI officials, he revealed Thursday.

Appearing on Fox Business, Mr. Lewandowski predicted that James Comey, Andrew McCabe and other former FBI officials will face criminal referrals after Michael Horowitz, the Department of Justice’s inspector general, finishes an investigation into potential abuse of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA.

The FBI obtained warrants under FISA to monitor the communications of former Trump associates as part of a counterintelligence investigation into Russian election interference, which the president has regularly categorized as illegal “spying” authorized by the previous administration against his campaign.

Speaking to host Gregg Jarrett, Mr. Lewandowski said he expected the watchdog’s review will result in charges being recommended against several former FBI officials involved in the Russia probe, including Mr. Comey, the former director of the FBI, and Mr. McCabe, the bureau’s former deputy director, as well as former FBI agent Peter Strzok and former FBI lawyer Lisa Page, who had both worked on the investigation prior to being caught exchanging disparaging text messages about Mr. Trump.

“I think what we’re going to see, Gregg, is in March or April of next year, James Comey, Andy McCabe, Strzok and Page will be on trial for the crimes they committed against the Fourth Amendment and against this president,” Mr. Lewandowski said. “But we can’t wait.”

The FBI began investigating members of Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign during the 2016 race to identify potential ties to the Russian government, which the U.S. intelligence community has accused of interfering in the election in an attempt to help Mr. Trump defeat Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.

The probe was launched by the FBI under the leadership of Mr. Comey, who Mr. Trump fired in May 2017. The Justice Department subsequently appointed former FBI Director Robert Mueller to serve as special counsel tasked with resuming the Russia probe, and that investigation ultimately resulted in criminal charges against 34 people, including several former members of Mr. Trump’s campaign.

Mr. McCabe was fired from the FBI in March 2018, hours ahead of his scheduled retirement. Ms. Page left the special counsel’s team in July 2017, and Mr. Strzok was removed from the Russia probe over the text messages prior to eventually being fired in August.

Mr. Barr said last month that he expected the inspector general’s report to be completed by May or June.

Trump’s Public Enemies List Is an Impeachable Offense,https://www.thedailybeast.com,['David R. Lurie'],05-25-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/trumps-public-enemies-list-is-an-impeachable-offense,"Long before becoming president, Donald Trump called for the jailing of his adversaries. Aided by Attorney General William Barr, he may now actually be training the full force of federal law enforcement against his enemies, real or perceived. Unlike Richard Nixon, who acted in secret, Trump is corrupting the justice system openly and publicly.

The seriousness of such a presidential abuse of power, and its potential for undermining the constitutional order, could well surpass any of the crimes detailed in the Mueller Report. Indeed, the Congress long ago recognized that such misconduct can merit impeachment.

Trump’s desire to investigate the investigators who uncovered the Russian plot to elect him president has taken on a special urgency since the release of the Mueller Report, with Trump repeatedly accusing government officials of “treason,” and the White House declaring: “This whole thing was a TAKEDOWN ATTEMPT at the President of the United States.”

On Thursday night, after Trump had spent days excoriating the purportedly “treasonous” investigators by name, he announced he had granted Barr the “full and complete authority” to declassify documents relating to the Russia probe. The White House also stated that Trump had directed intelligence agencies to “quickly and fully” cooperate with the investigation into the investigation.

It’s reminiscent of Nixon’s secret scheme to “use the available federal machinery to screw our political enemies,” as then-White House Counsel John Dean put it, by manipulating “grant availability, federal contract, litigation, prosecution, etc.” Nixon directed the IRS provide potentially damaging information against some of his enemies. Although the agency’s commissioner refused Nixon’s demand, the scheme became part of the impeachment case against Nixon, which accused him of illegally endeavoring “to obtain [information] from the Internal Revenue Service, in violation of the constitutional rights of citizens.”

While much of Nixon’s scheme was forestalled, Trump appears poised to effectuate his. Barr recently named Connecticut U.S. Attorney John Durham (best known for investigating the FBI’s corrupt relationship with Boston mobster James “Whitey” Bulger) to head up an inquiry into the “origins” of the Russia investigation. Unnamed government officials have attempted to minimize the significance of the inquiry by stating to the press that it does not currently entail the use of grand jury subpoenas, but that of course could change at any time—indeed, Senator Lindsey Graham is publicly demanding as much.

Barr, meanwhile, has become remarkably open about his intent to follow the president’s lead by making the investigators the focus of as much opprobrium as possible. In Senate testimony several weeks ago, Barr denied endorsing the president’s accusation that there was “improper surveillance”of the Trump campaign. More recently, however, he responded to a Fox News interviewer’s question whether he “smell[ed] a rat” at the FBI by stating: “I don’t know if I’d describe it as a rat. I would just say that the answers that I’m getting are not sufficient.” In the same interview, Barr emphasized that officials at the highest levels of the FBI and other agencies were involved, in a plain allusion to James Comey and the other former high-level law enforcement and intelligence officials that Trump has repeatedly excoriated.

“ Barr even opined that the evidence against Clinton was stronger than any potential evidence of wrongdoing by the president. ”

Trump’s initial target was Hillary Clinton.Trump implored Jeff Sessions (ultimately with some success) to reopen an investigation into unsubstantiated claims that she had improperly interfered in the sale of a uranium mining concern, Uranium One, to a Russian company as secretary of state. In November 2017, the New York Times’s called 10 former attorneys general, but only one responded to its question whether Sessions should accede to Trump’s loud demands: It was Barr, who said he saw no problem with the president training the sights of the Department of Justice on a political enemy, as long as it was “warrant[ed].” Barr even opined that the evidence against Clinton was stronger than any potential evidence of wrongdoing by the president, this despite the fact that the primary “evidence” for the Uranium One allegations came from a book sponsored by Steve Bannon.

Barr seemed unconcerned with the risk posed by a president employing the Justice Department as a mechanism for exacting revenge against a former electoral opponent. Indeed, Barr declared, the department would be “abdicating its responsibility” if it did not pursue Clinton as Trump desired. In a memorandum he later wrote to the DOJ officials overseeing Mueller, and shared with Trump’s defense team, before becoming attorney general, Barr asserted that there is “no limit” on the president’s authority to direct the course of law enforcement investigations, including those he is personally interested in.

In fact, Trump’s effort to undermine the legitimacy of the now-completed Russia investigation is part-and-parcel of Trump’s earlier efforts to limit and even terminate the investigation while it was ongoing, conduct that the Mueller Report identified as potential obstruction of justice, and that Trump (with Barr’s support) has asserted merely amounted to “fighting back.”

Barr suggested to the Times that there is just no problem with a president personally selecting who should or should not become the subjects of criminal investigations, as long as the facts “warrant” inquiries. But that entirely misses the point.

As the nation recognized during the Watergate era, if the president employs the apparatus of the federal government to single out and punish political or personal enemies by making them the focus of law enforcement investigations, the perception (and the reality) of fairness on which our justice system depends will be gravely endangered."
The Director Of US Citizenship And Immigration Services Is Resigning As Trump Continues His Purge,https://www.buzzfeednews.com,"['Hamed Aleaziz', 'Buzzfeed News Reporter']",,,,https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/hamedaleaziz/director-citizenship-and-immigration-services-resigns,"L. Francis Cissna, director of US Citizenship and Immigration Services, speaks at the White House in 2017.

According to the Washington Post, which first reported the resignation, former Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli, a well-known firebrand who has, among other things, supported moves to restrict birthright citizenship, is set to replace Cissna.

“At the request of the President, I submitted my resignation today effective June 1, 2019,” Cissna wrote in the email. “During the past 20 months, every day, I have passionately worked to carry out USCIS’ mission to faithfully administer the nation’s lawful immigration system. We are the agency charged with safeguarding its integrity and promise.”

L. Francis Cissna, the director of the US Citizenship and Immigration Services, submitted his resignation Friday at the direction of President Trump, according to an email he sent to staff.

Cissna’s departure is the latest high-profile shake up at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in recent weeks. It began in early April, when then acting-director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Ronald Vitiello had his nomination to lead the agency withdrawn by Trump. Soon after, then-DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen stepped down, followed by the departure of the acting deputy secretary and chief of staff.

One source with knowledge of the White House's thinking said Cissna was perceived as ""lacking the leadership, assertiveness and executive savvy"" to guide the administration's biggest policy priorities in the second half of Trump's first term.

""In terms of key administration priorities, the amount of unfinished work is extraordinary,"" the source said. ""Francis has been unwilling or unable to challenge the bureaucracy around him to strengthen asylum standards, close loopholes, advance pro-worker reforms, and take bold, decisive action to push policy and regulations through bureaucratic hurdles and roadblocks.""

Jessica Vaughan, policy director for the Center for Immigration Studies, a restrictive immigration group, also said it was “no surprise” some in the White House were impatient with Cissna’s stead and careful approach to making moves.

“Another difficulty for him was that his priority was reforming abuses in the legal immigration system and modernizing the system to benefit applicants, while some in the White House wanted the focus to be nearly exclusively on illegal immigration, and allowing businesses to avoid much scrutiny,” she said.

Cissna, who served for more than a decade at DHS, was appointed to lead the agency in the early days of the Trump administration. Since then, he has won the praise of immigration restrictionists who believe he dutifully carried out Trump’s campaign promises to stem the flow of immigrants, including pushing a proposal that immigrants who use or are likely to use public benefits, such as food stamps and housing vouchers, could be denied green cards or entry into the United States.

Elsewhere, Cissna cracked down on the H1B visa system, announced plans to shutdown international Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) offices, and, in what many saw as a symbolic step, took out the phrase “nation of immigrants” from the agency’s mission statement. Under his direction, the agency was also considering moves to institute a fee for asylum applications and extend the time asylum seekers needed to wait to obtain work permits.

“Francis Cissna knows the immigration system inside out, and that knowledge allowed him to spearhead some of the most restrictive legal immigration policies we’ve ever seen,” said Sarah Pierce, a policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute. “The administration will likely be hard-pressed to replace him.”

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has previously signaled his displeasure with Cuccinelli, including telling reporters that he had told Trump not to take up the former Virginia attorney general as head of DHS.

""I've not spoken to him about any of them. I have expressed my, shall I say, lack of enthusiasm for one of them … Ken Cuccinelli,"" he reportedly told reporters at the time.

Some Trump administration officials were dismayed with the move.

“The administration is making an aesthetic move that castrates the most effective immigration law practitioner in order to install a hero of the defeated right,” one official said.

One DHS official said Cissna had a “deep understanding” of the immigration immigration system.

“He worked tirelessly to implement the President's agenda and it's hard to imagine someone else more qualified to do so,” the official said."
DOJ accuses Assange of violating Espionage Act,https://www.politico.com,"['Natasha Bertrand', 'Alex Isenstadt', 'James Arkin', 'Jun Mai', 'South China Morning Post']",05-23-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/23/doj-accuses-assange-of-violating-espionage-act-1342653,"Julian Assange from a police vehicle on his arrival at Westminster Magistrates court on April 11, 2019 in London, England. Among the charges are three counts that Assange violated the Espionage Act, which prohibits the disclosure of national defense information. | Jack Taylor/Getty Images legal DOJ accuses Assange of violating Espionage Act

The Justice Department has hit WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange with Espionage Act charges, escalating a legal fight against the high-profile activist and alarming press freedom activists.

DOJ had previously only indicted Assange on a single count of conspiracy to commit computer intrusion. Thursday’s revelation of the additional 18 charges, filed in the Eastern District of Virginia, means Assange could face significantly more prison time if found guilty.

Story Continued Below

The alleged Espionage Act violations relate to Assange’s complicity with Chelsea Manning, a former U.S. Army soldier who was convicted in July 2013 of violating the Espionage Act after she shuttled troves of classified government information to WikiLeaks. Officials said Assange solicited the information from and then brazenly published details that put the government's human sources at risk, disregarding explicit warnings from the government.

Traditionally, the Espionage Act has been used against government officials, like Manning, who reveal such classified information, rather than the journalists or foreign nationals who publish the information.

As a result, the use of the Espionage Act against Assange set off alarm bells among press freedom activists on Thursday. While WikiLeaks isn’t a conventional news organization, press advocates have long feared that charging Assange for the publication of government secrets could open the door to prosecuting reporters for doing the same.

""Any government use of the Espionage Act to criminalize the receipt and publication of classified information poses a dire threat to journalists seeking to publish such information in the public interest, irrespective of the Justice Department’s assertion that Assange is not a journalist,"" said Bruce Brown, executive director of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, in a statement.

Edward Snowden, the former NSA contractor who also touched off a debate about the media's role in publishing secret files when he leaked classified information to reporters in 2013, proclaimed: “the Department of Justice just declared war – not on Wikileaks, but on journalism itself.”

John Demers, head of DOJ’s national security division, pushed back at that argument on Thursday, insisting Assange is “not a journalist,” and alleging that the WikiLeaks founder “purposely published names he knew to be confidential human sources in warzones.”

It's a debate that Justice Department officials have grappled with for years. The Obama administration previously looked into bringing similar charges against Assange, but decided against it.

“We didn’t bring this [Espionage Act] case for a couple of reasons,"" said Matt Miller, an Obama-era DOJ spokesman. ""First, we thought it was a dangerous precedent to prosecute Assange for something that reporters do all the time. We didn’t believe Assange was a journalist, but the Espionage Act doesn’t make any distinction between journalists and others, so if you can apply it to Assange, there’s no real reason you couldn’t apply it to [The New York Times]. Second, and it’s related, it’s not at all clear that charging someone with the publication of classified information could survive court scrutiny.”

Assange’s legal case took off in April after Ecuador revoked its seven-year asylum, forcing him out of the embassy in London and paving the way for his extradition to the United States for one of the biggest ever leaks of classified information. Justice Department officials said they could not comment on how this might affect Assange’s extradition from the U.K. to the U.S.

Among Thursday's charges are three counts that Assange violated the Espionage Act, which prohibits the disclosure of national defense information. The Justice Department alleged that Assange published select State Department cables that contained the unredacted names of human sources in Iran, China and Syria. He also published Afghan activity reports and Iraq activity reports that endangered local Afghans and Iraqis, prosecutors alleged.

“It was explicitly stated in the State Department cables that the identity of sources was to be protected,” a Justice Department official told reporters on Thursday. “Assange was warned by the State Department not to release the names but he did so nevertheless.”

However, the government has not identified any individuals who were directly killed a result of Assange's disclosures. The U.S. counterintelligence official who led the Pentagon's review of the bombshell leaks told a court during Manning’s sentencing hearing in 2013 that investigators had not been able to find any such instances.

Still, Zach Terwilliger, the U.S. attorney in the Eastern District of Virginia, stressed that the government was “not charging Assange for passively obtaining classified information.” Rather, he is being prosecuted for publishing “a narrow set of classified documents in which Assange also published the names of innocent people who risked their safety” to help the United States.

“Assange is not charged simply because he is a publisher,” Terwilliger told reporters on Thursday.

Prosecutors said Manning had contacted Assange as early as November 2009, responding ""to Assange’s solicitation of classified information made through the WikiLeaks website."" The appeal included a “Military and Intelligence Most Wanted Leaks” category that solicited CIA detainee interrogation videos.

Assange also encouraged Manning to transfer him Guantanamo Bay detainee assessment briefs in March 2010, according to chats obtained by the government, as well as Iraq rule of engagement files and 75,000 Afghanistan war-related significant activity reports.

John Brown, the FBI assistant director for counterintelligence, said the indictment was “the result of nearly a decade” of work.

The original Assange indictment, brought in March 2018 and unsealed in April of this year, charged the WikiLeaks founder with conspiring with Manning to hack a government computer to obtain hundreds of thousands of U.S. military reports about U.S. wars in the Middle East. WikiLeaks later published the leaked information.

Assange faces up to 10 years in prison on each count.

Manning was jailed in March after being held in contempt by a judge in Virginia for refusing to testify before a grand jury about Assange. She is still in prison, and DOJ officials would not comment on her situation on Thursday.

"Ex-FBI lawyer: Carter Page FISA application approved in 'unusual' way by McCabe, Yates, and Baker",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-23-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/ex-fbi-lawyer-carter-page-fisa-application-approved-in-unusual-way-by-mccabe-yates-and-baker,"A former top lawyer for the FBI described to lawmakers the “unusual” way the surveillance request targeting former Trump campaign associate Carter Page was handled by top leadership at the Justice Department and FBI, according to a transcript released this week.

In front of a joint session of the House Judiciary and Oversight committees on Aug. 31, 2018, former FBI Deputy General Counsel Trisha Anderson said she was normally responsible for signing off on Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act applications before they reached the desk of her superiors for approval. Anderson said the “linear path” those applications typically take was upended in October 2016, with FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe and Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates signing off on the application before she did. Because of that unusual high-level involvement, she didn’t see the need to “second guess” the FISA application.

The Page FISA application was filed by the Justice Department and FBI with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court in October 2016. A surveillance warrant was granted and three renewals were subsequently approved. The FISA application relied heavily on unverified research in British ex-spy Christopher Steele's dossier on President Trump's ties to Russia, which was compiled through his employment with opposition research firm Fusion GPS with funding from the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee through the Perkins Coie law firm.

Anderson said all FISAs need to be signed off on in the FBI’s National Security Law Branch, where she was assigned at the time. Anderson said she was the Senior Executive Service approver for the “initiation” of the Page FISA, including determining whether there is legal sufficiency.

But Anderson stressed “in this particular case, I'm drawing a distinction because my boss and my boss’ boss had already reviewed and approved this application.” She emphasized “this one was handled a little bit differently in that sense, in that it received very high-level review and approvals — informal, oral approvals — before it ever came to me for signature.”

Anderson said that FISA approvals are typically “tracked in a linear fashion” and that someone in the Senior Executive Service “is the final approver on hard copy before a FISA goes to the director or deputy director for signature.” She said the Page FISA was approved outside regular procedures.

""Because there were very high-level discussions that occurred about the FISA,"" Anderson said she believed that meant “the FISA essentially had already been well-vetted all the way up through at least the Deputy Director [McCabe] level on our side and through the DAG [Yates] on the DOJ side.” Yates had already signed the application by the time it made it to Anderson’s desk.

The publicly available Page FISA documents show then-FBI Director James Comey also signed off on it.

Because the FISA application had already been approved at such high levels, Anderson said she did not look at the Page FISA application with much skepticism. “I wouldn't view it as my role to second-guess that substantive approval that had already been given by the Deputy Director [McCabe] and by the Deputy Attorney General [Yates] in this particular instance,"" she said.

Asked why this FISA application was different, Anderson said she believed “the sensitivity level of this particular FISA resulted in lots of very high-level attention both within the FBI and DOJ.”

“The General Counsel [Jim Baker] … personally reviewed and made edits to the FISA, for example,” Anderson said. “The Deputy Director was involved in reviewing the FISA line by line. The Deputy Attorney General over on the DOJ side of the street was similarly involved, as I understood, reviewing the FISA application line by line.”

Baker recently defended the FBI’s handling of the FISA process, saying “we took [the dossier] seriously” but “we didn’t necessarily take it literally” and did not treat it as “literally true in every respect.” Baker also said, “I am not going to go into details with respect to what investigative steps we actually took to try to validate it.” Former FBI Director James Comey still referred to the dossier as “salacious and unverified” even in 2017.

Anderson stressed that McCabe, Yates, and Baker all played key roles in reviewing the Page FISA. “My approval at that point was really purely administrative in nature. In other words, the substantive issues — the FISA had already substantively been approved by people much higher than me in the chain of command,"" Anderson said.

Anderson said it “typically would not have been the case” that people such as McCabe and Yates would sign off on a FISA application before she did.

""That part of it was unusual, and so I didn't consider my review at that point in the process to be substantive in nature,"" Anderson said. ""In other words, there were smart lawyers, high-level people on both sides of the street who had reviewed and signed off on the application, the details of the application. And so I was simply signaling, yes, this package is ready to go forward.""

Anderson said the seal of approval from such high-ranking FBI and DOJ officials meant that her signature on the FISA application was mostly perfunctory.

Anderson cast doubt on whether Comey would usually read a full FISA application, considering he could receive more than a dozen in a given day. “And so, yes, the director or deputy director, if he signs the FISA, you know, relies on others,” Anderson said.

Even in normal circumstances, Anderson said she likely would not read the full FISA application before signing off on it “unless there were an issue that was identified by the cover note,"" due to time constraints.

Anderson admitted she did not read the Page FISA the day that she signed off on it but noted she’d read it at some earlier point in time.

The FBI’s handling of the Steele dossier has come under increased scrutiny in recent weeks, and there are at least three federal investigations into alleged FISA abuse and other matters related to the way the FBI and DOJ conducted the Trump-Russia investigation."

EPA wants to triple level of rocket fuel chemical allowed in drinking water,https://thinkprogress.org,[],,,,https://thinkprogress.org/epa-rocket-fuel-chemical-drinking-water-e6ee56c9ee13/,"The Trump Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) wants to raise the threshold for a chemical found in rocket fuel to triple the previous limit allowed in drinking water supplies. This is the first new drinking water rule introduced by the agency since the George W. Bush administration.

In the EPA’s latest move to weaken environmental and health protections, it released a notice on Thursday requesting public comment on its proposal to raise the maximum level allowed for the chemical perchlorate — which is linked to thyroid problems — to 56 micrograms per liter.

This is three times higher than what the EPA previously recommended as a safe level for drinking water (15 micrograms per liter). The previous recommendation was just an advisory to help guide states, as opposed to an enforceable limit, which is what the agency is now proposing.

In addition to this change, the EPA is seeking comment on three other alternate options: setting the level to 18 micrograms per liter, to 90 micrograms per liter, or simply abolishing the rule regulating perchlorate in drinking water.

The news comes after a decade-long delay following a lawsuit by the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) demanding the EPA set an enforceable standard for the chemical.

“This is enough to make you sick—literally,” Erik Olson, senior director for health and food at NRDC, said in a statement on the new proposed limits. “As a result, millions of Americans will be at risk of exposure to dangerous levels of this toxic chemical in their drinking water.”

In addition to rocket fuel, perchlorate is found in fireworks, airbags, matches, signal flares, some food packaging, and munitions. Health risks from exposure include disruption to the thyroid’s ability to produce hormones needed for normal growth and development, along with potentially causing reproductive problems.

According to NRDC, scientists recommend a limit that is “10 to more than 50 times lower” than what the EPA is currently proposing. Two states currently have much stricter, enforceable standards than required by the EPA: California (at 6 micrograms per liter) and Massachusetts (at 2 micrograms per liter).

The EPA’s proposal comes as the agency has been dragging its feet on implementing a similar legally enforceable standard for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) — a group of man-made chemicals that are toxic to humans and can increase the risk of cancer — in drinking water. Currently there is no maximum level for PFAS chemicals under EPA rules. Numerous communities in 43 states are currently suffering from the toxic chemical polluting their water.

These delays or weakening of chemical standards come despite EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler recent arguments that water issues are the world’s leading environmental crisis.

“This is another Trump administration gift to polluters and water utilities that have lobbied to be off the hook for cleaning up the problem,” Olson said of the proposed change to perchlorate.

The Trump EPA features several top officials who once worked for the chemical industry. This includes a former Koch Industries staffer, David Dunlap, who worked on water and chemical policy and now serves as deputy EPA assistant administrator for research and development, and a former chemical industry attorney, Steven Cook, who oversees Superfund sites. Meanwhile, Nancy Beck, the Trump administration appointee who oversees the EPA’s toxic chemical unit, previously worked as an executive at the American Chemistry Council, one of the industry’s main lobbying groups.

What’s more, a 2009 House Committee report found that Beck, a former Bush administration official, was slowing progress in confirming the health threats from chemicals like perchlorate found in drinking water. The committee concluded she had been “inappropriately intervening in agency science.”

Ties to the chemical industry also extend to Wheeler. In a letter sent to the EPA administrator last month, Chairman of the House Oversight Committee, Rep. Elijah Cummings (D- MD), accused Wheeler of failing to disclose his previous lobbying on behalf of Darling Ingredients, which is involved in making fuel and fertilizers regulated by the EPA."
"Intelligence community to provide ""appropriate"" information to DOJ for Russia review",https://www.cbsnews.com,['Olivia Gazis'],,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/intelligence-community-to-provide-appropriate-information-to-doj-russia-review-barr-declassification/,"President Trump's decision to empower Attorney General William Barr with sweeping declassification authorities has seeded a simmering conflict between the Department of Justice and the intelligence community that centers on the president's long-held objections to investigations launched into links between his 2016 campaign and Russia.

Mr. Trump on Thursday granted Barr ""full and complete authority"" to declassify government secrets and instructed the intelligence community to ""quickly and fully"" cooperate with Barr's review of the investigation into Russia's 2016 interference.

In doing so, the president is allowing Barr to declassify information of which other agencies — including the CIA, FBI and NSA — are the custodians, and whose public release would typically be determined by the Director of National Intelligence (DNI).

In a carefully-worded statement released Friday, DNI Dan Coats seemed to assert some of his own jurisdiction by indicating the intelligence community would provide the Department of Justice with all ""appropriate"" information related to its review, while implying excessive, inappropriate or politically-motivated demands would meet with pushback.

""I am confident that the Attorney General will work with the [intelligence community] in accordance with the long-established standards to protect highly-sensitive classified information that, if publicly released, would put our national security at risk,"" Coats said.

""The [intelligence community] will continue to faithfully execute its mission of providing timely, apolitical intelligence to the president and policymakers,"" he said.

For almost as long as he has been in office, the president has maintained that his campaign was improperly surveilled. With encouragement from supporters in congress and conservative media, he has inched closer to publishing classified materials he believes will prove his assertions.

Critics of the president warn that Barr could use his power to selectively release information that, devoid of context, supports the president's case while damaging some of Mr. Trump's self-identified nemeses — individuals Trump believes were politically motivated to derail his campaign.

Those opposed to the move say they see in it echoes of the attorney general's handling of the release of special counsel Robert Mueller's findings — which Barr at first distilled into a mostly favorable, abbreviated summary before releasing the far more damaging but still redacted full report itself.

Senate Intelligence Committee Vice Chairman Mark Warner said the attorney general had ""already shown that he has no problem selectively releasing information in order to mislead the American people.""

""People risk their lives to gather the intelligence material that President Trump and Attorney General Barr are so eager to politicize,"" the Democrat, who represents Virginia, said.

Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff of California, who serves as chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, called Mr. Trump's move an ""abuse of power"" whose underlying intention was to ""weaponize and politicize the nation's intelligence and law enforcement entities."" He said the committee would conduct ""vigorous oversight"" of any steps to ""selectively reveal and distort classified information.""

But allies of the president, including Republican Rep. Devin Nunes of California have previously urged Mr. Trump to take the steps he has now deputized Barr to take. Nunes is the former chairman and now ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee. He has claimed the roughly 20 classified pages of a surveillance warrant application for former Trump campaign associate Carter Page could undermine the FBI's work and suggest an abuse of procedure.

In September the president indicated in a pair of tweets that he was close to declassifying a number of items related to the Russia probe, but after a meeting with the Justice department and calls from unspecified ""key allies"" declined to move forward. He told Fox News in an interview at the time, ""I want to wait until after the election.""

During remarks to reporters on Friday, Mr. Trump explicitly named countries he suggested had played a role in triggering or fueling the investigation.

""I hope [Barr] looks at the [United Kingdom] and I hope he looks at Australia and I hope he looks at Ukraine. I hope he looks at everything, because there was a hoax that was perpetrated on our country,"" Mr. Trump said.

Both the United Kingdom and Australia are part of the ""Five Eyes"" intelligence-sharing group that also includes the United States, Canada and New Zealand. Mueller's report confirmed that the FBI's inquiry was triggered by an Australian diplomat's tip that former Trump campaign aide George Papadopoulos knew before it was public that Russians had damaging information on Hillary Clinton. The two met in 2016 in London, where CIA director Gina Haspel was station chief at the time.

Former national security officials said the public disclosure of intelligence contributions made by allies could damage those strategic relationships.

""It is yet another step that will raise questions among our allies and partners about whether to share sensitive intelligence with us,"" said CBS News senior national security contributor Michael Morell, who served as the CIA's deputy director and is now the host of Intelligence Matters.

He added that the president's move overall had led to a further ""destruction of norms that weakens our intelligence community.""

""It's very unusual — unprecedented in my experience — for a non-intelligence community officer to be given absolute declassification authority over the intelligence community,"" said David Kris, who led the DOJ's national security division and now heads the Culper Partners consulting firm.

""This extraordinary assignment and the reaction it has provoked show how far we have moved from historical norms,"" he said."
"A better VA, with mental health services, is essential for America's veterans",https://thehill.com,[],05-25-2019,2019,5,https://thehill.com/opinion/national-security/445286-a-better-va-with-mental-health-services-is-essential-for-americas,"In our nation’s history, more than 1 million American servicemembers have been killed in U.S. wars. For the past 151 years on the fourth Monday of May, we have honored the great soldiers, sailors, Marines and airmen who have fallen.

Much has changed, but the generations of brave men and women willing to make the ultimate sacrifice in the name of freedom have endured, and the sanctity with which we regard these individuals has remained.

There are many millions of veterans, however, who returned home from war to find a country unable to provide them access to basic human rights such as quality civilian employment opportunities, health care and education. In recent years alone, 20.4 million men and women risked their lives for their country and, in return, many were refused fundamental care by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). President Trump Donald John TrumpA better VA, with mental health services, is essential for America's veterans Pelosi, Nadler tangle on impeachment, contempt vote Trump arrives in Japan to kick off 4-day state visit MORE has renewed the fight for these veterans.

The VA fell into disarray under the Obama administration. President Obama tried to establish reform with initiatives such as the Veterans Choice Program to expand health care options and reduce wait time for medical appointments to a maximum of 30 days. This policy was great in theory, but in practice the Government Accountability Office found that some veterans waited up to 70 days for care and many died as a result.

Why was this happening? Some VA personnel neglected their duties by falsifying wait times for medical care and ignoring major systemic issues in the medical network with no accountability.

When President Trump took office in 2017, he pledged that the men and women who uphold our country’s freedoms no longer would be ignored by their government. In June 2017, he signed the Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act. This legislation resulted in the removal, demotion or suspension of more than 4,000 employees who exhibited substandard performance. By weeding out the under-performers, veterans have been left with a better-functioning VA.

The Trump administration continues to move forward with efforts to expand VA accountability like the implementation of the “Access and Quality Tool,” a platform that allows veterans to view wait times and assess quality-of-care data when choosing health care providers. As a result, wait times have improved and are comparable to the private sector.

There is a prevalence of mental illness in the veteran community that was not effectively addressed under Obama. Thirty one percent of active duty and reserve military personnel who were deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan have experienced some form of mental illness or have reported experiencing a traumatic brain injury, but only 30 percent of those servicemembers will get treatment. The 70 percent who go untreated are forced to cope and, sadly, 22 veterans die by suicide every day in the United States, on average. Substance abuse precedes approximately 30 percent of all veteran suicides and about 20 percent of high-risk behavior deaths.

The stigma surrounding mental health treatment has created a substantial access gap in coverage, meaning many people who need to be receiving treatment may not be. In an effort to create more accessible options, President Trump secured $73.1 billion in funding for VA mental health services, opioid abuse prevention, suicide prevention and rural veterans’ health initiatives.

Veterans’ choices and access to medical care have expanded with the VA Mission act, making it easier for veterans to find treatment in their own communities and providing access to walk-in clinics for immediate care.

The president also signed an executive order requiring Homeland Security, Defense and Veterans Affairs secretaries to construct a joint plan that affords veterans access to mental health treatment.

The transition from a uniformed life to a civilian one is not easy, but President Trump has worked to ensure that veterans have access to quality job opportunities. The jobless rate for all veterans fell to an 18-year low of 3.5 percent in 2018, from its peak at 9.9 percent in 2011.

President Obama once said, “Our nation owes a debt to its fallen heroes that we can never fully repay.” Although that is true, it is with gratitude that we honor the fallen heroes whose bravery and sacrifice has ensured our freedom. Not just this day but every day, we must choose to honor their memory by caring for those soldiers who did return home. As President Trump said, “We will not rest until all of America’s great veterans receive the care they’ve earned through their incredible service and sacrifice to our country.”

President Donald Trump's snap decision to send billions of dollars in new aid to farmers could be bad for the farm economy and the federal budget.

Many farmers are still deciding what to plant this spring and could be swayed toward crops that receive higher payouts from the aid package, such as soybeans. That would add to already record supplies and further depress prices that have been falling for five years.

Story Continued Below

Trump tweeted about the new bailout for farmers earlier this month, soon after he decided to raise tariffs on $200 billion worth of imports from China and Beijing retaliated by raising duties on $60 billion in U.S. products, many of them agricultural. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue, who weeks earlier denied the White House was discussing another round of aid so soon after a $12 billion bailout last year, suddenly interrupted a trip to South Korea to announce a second program.

Farm groups are headed to the White House on Thursday afternoon to join Trump as he announces a $16 billion boost for agriculture. The American Farm Bureau Federation and groups representing soybean, corn, wheat and pork producers are expected to attend, as well as lawmakers including Sen. John Hoeven (R-N.D.), who has worked closely with the administration on the aid package.

“We want to make sure that the farmers are being protected as we go through the process of negotiating new trade deals,” White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Wednesday outside the White House.

But the Trump administration’s decision to roll out the program now is drawing critics.

Sen. Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, told reporters Wednesday that the White House should have been more cautious about the timing of the announcement because farmers are still planting.

“[W]e want farmers to make decisions on how many acres of corn and soybeans to plant based on the market and not something the government’s doing,” he said.

“The timing couldn’t have been worse,” said Jonathan Coppess, an agricultural policy professor at the University of Illinois, and a former head of the USDA Farm Service Agency during the Obama administration.

Rainfall in the Midwest has delayed planting, so many farmers can still switch up their crops. Even the prospect of another round of trade assistance could encourage them to plant more soybeans, Coppess said.

""There is certainly enough experience at USDA to know that announcing payments during planting might well cause more problems,"" Coppess said.

USDA’s first trade aid package sent the bulk of direct payments to soybeans given the significant damage that China’s 25 percent tariff on U.S. imports has done to prices and demand. China, the world’s top pork producer, is expected to need fewer soybeans to feed its hogs this year because African swine fever has forced the government to kill more than a million animals.

This year, the amount of money farmers receive will largely depend on the county in which they live in, instead of what they grow, the USDA announced on Thursday.

USDA officials estimated the amount of economic damage inflicted on different counties as a result of the trade disputes and will multiply that by what was planted in the area this year.

“We wanted to make sure producers are planting for the market,” Bill Northey, USDA undersecretary for farm production and conservation, told reporters Thursday.

The 2018 trade package was based on what crops farmers actually planted that season — bucking Congress' efforts over the years to make subsidy programs more market-oriented by tying them to farmers' average historical acres and yields.

The aid programs in both years primarily involve sending direct payments to farmers and ranchers using funds from the Commodity Credit Corporation, a Depression-era financial institution under the USDA that has broad authority to stabilize the farm economy.

But it is unclear whether the CCC has enough borrowing authority to fund another tariff-relief program. It is only allowed to borrow $30 billion per fiscal year from the U.S. Treasury to fund its work, and last year’s bailout used a big chunk of that. The CCC also is used to fund traditional farm subsidies authorized every five years by Congress.

Lawmakers last September included language in a short-term spending bill that effectively gave the CCC more flexibility to keep money flowing.

Hoeven, who chairs the Senate Appropriations subpanel overseeing USDA, told reporters last week that Congress can easily reimburse the financial institution if needed.

Trump is using taxpayer money to help just one industry harmed by trade policy. Other industries reeling from the tariff battles, from car manufacturers to shoe retailers, are not expected to receive financial aid.

Some farmers recognize the disparity, and stress that they would prefer to have open access to markets.

""We prefer that over a check from the government,"" said Mark Watne, president of the North Dakota Farmers Union. ""But right now, our own government is making our demand go down. We can't control that.""

US Energy Department Wants to See Lighter Offshore Wind Turbines,https://www.greentechmedia.com,[],,,,https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/us-energy-department-wants-to-see-lighter-offshore-wind-turbines,"Offshore wind power could be a lot cheaper if the generators inside the turbine nacelles were lighter. The U.S. Department of Energy is here to help.

DOE recently made available up to $8 million for four projects aiming to “develop more efficient, smaller, and lighter-weight generators.” According to DOE, the prospective designs could result in 50 percent smaller and lighter generators, which could reduce the levelized cost of wind energy by as much as 25 percent.

With an eye toward the mammoth wind turbines coming online by the mid-2020s — GE announced plans in March 2018 to commercially deploy a 12-megawatt offshore turbine in 2021 — the Energy Department wants to nudge manufacturers to build generators that can more easily be hoisted atop hubs topping out more than 100 meters above the waterline.

Project teams led by ABB, WEG Electric Corporation, American Superconductor and General Electric Global Research, respectively, were each to receive up to $400,000 to design a wind turbine generator capable of scaling to a capacity of 10 megawatts or more. ABB subsequently confirmed to Greentech Media it will not pursue the research project it had planned under the DOE grant, but the other three remain active.

After an initial one-year conceptual design phase, DOE will select one of the projects to receive up to $6.4 million for the construction of a scaled prototype. The full research program is expected to last four years.

Next-gen direct drive generators

The teams involved in the DOE-funded research project are developing direct-drive technologies for their planned high-efficiency, lighter generators.

Direct-drive machines generate electricity without using a gearbox, resulting in avoided maintenance. “Having all of those moving parts makes the gearbox one of the highest-maintenance parts of a wind turbine,” noted the DOE in a recent blog post.

According to Aaron Barr, senior consultant at Wood Mackenzie Power & Renewables, the current generation of direct-drive wind generators “has reached technical and commercial maturity,” accounting for 26 percent of the wind turbines installed on land and 50 percent installed at sea globally in 2018.

But direct-drive turbines come with their own tradeoffs. Current designs rely on permanent magnets that require expensive, heavy rare earth elements. This in turn increases the weight of direct drive generators relative to those used in geared wind turbines.

WEG Electric Corporation plans to develop a lightweight generator designed both to use less rare earth materials than conventional geared turbines and to be integrated into its existing platform. ABB had planned to develop a generator that uses a magnet cooling system for use in either geared or direct-drive turbines as large as 15 megawatts.

The other two project teams — American Superconductor and GE — are developing superconducting generators expected to greatly reduce the need for rare earth materials.

GE’s proposed ultra-light low-temperature superconducting generator relies on lessons learned from the company’s decades-long magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) work. The goal is a solution customized for offshore wind turbines larger than 12 megawatts.

“Superconducting electric machines aren’t really anything new. What is new is some of the cryogenic technologies that have evolved over the years for MRI we can now bring to electric machines to make them practical,” David Torrey, GE’s team leader, told Greentech Media in an interview.

He added, “To the extent you can raise the magnetic field, you can produce more power with less heat, making your generator more efficient.”

Superconducting generators' path to market

According to WoodMac's Barr, superconducting generators have been researched for years but manufacturers have yet to develop a commercial prototype.

Wood Mackenzie estimates that the technology is at least a decade from commercialization, with deployment likely to come in next-generation 15-megawatt or larger offshore wind turbines.

“However, this will require an intensive R&D effort from OEMs, supply chain partners, and government-funded research,” Barr said.

That's the reasoning behind the Department of Energy’s push to jump-start R&D in this space.

Direct-drive and superconducting generators have the most market potential at sea, where the reduced size and weight of the next-generation generators envisaged by DOE are likely to have the greatest impact.

“Offshore turbines are expected to be 60 percent direct-drive by 2025,” said Barr.

DOE sees high-efficiency, lightweight generators as one way to reduce the weight and cost of towers and foundations for both bottom-fixed and floating offshore turbines.

“As we look to the future with floating offshore wind platforms to access wind resources where the water is too deep for conventional foundations, lightweighting while maintaining high efficiency becomes even more important,” wrote the DOE’s project team.

Just don’t expect the DOE-backed generator designs to take over the market in the near term.

“The design cycle for offshore turbines is very long, due to the massive scale of the technology, significant supply chain investment, and high risk that dictates extensive validation periods,” said Barr.

“The DOE-funded research is unlikely to be applied commercially on the next generation of offshore wind turbines until 2030 or later.”

However, GE’s Torrey was optimistic that earlier deployment might be possible.

“We consider the MRI technology to be quite mature right now. Barring any unforeseen surprises, I think we can certainly have something deployed well before 2030.”"

The new rule also could put goods from other countries at risk of higher tariffs, including Japan, South Korea, India, Germany and Switzerland.

Those countries, along with China, were all listed on the Treasury Department's semi-annual currency report's ""monitoring list,"" which tracks currency market interventions, high global current account surpluses and high bilateral trade surpluses.

The department said its proposed rule would amend the normal countervailing duty process to include new criteria for currency undervaluation. Trump administration officials have long viewed China's yuan as undervalued against the dollar, despite the U.S.-China trade war, which foreign currency experts say has hurt the yuan's value.

(Daniel Acker/Bloomberg News)

At a Smithfield hog plant in central Illinois, federal meat inspectors examine pig carcasses on the slaughter line, remove diseased and contaminated meat, and mark it “condemned.” They have the exclusive responsibility for performing this work.

At another hog plant about 75 miles away, JBS USA Food Co. employees are part of a long-running test program in which they perform tasks similar to those done by federal inspectors. When plant employees do this food safety work, the U.S. Department of Agriculture says they are “sorting” and “removing” or “disposing” of the meat, not inspecting or condemning it.

The shift in language is central to the USDA’s efforts to make the most dramatic changes to federal meat-inspection policy since Congress passed a 1906 landmark law that seized control of food safety from plant owners and made it the province of federal inspectors.

The proposed new inspection system transfers some responsibilities that traditionally have been handled by USDA inspectors to employees of pork plants. The USDA says it has studied the new inspection system for 20 years and that pork products from the test plants are at least as safe as those produced by traditional inspection. They say federal inspectors will spend less time visually assessing pork and more time ensuring sanitary conditions are maintained throughout the plant.

Several food safety lawyers, Democratic members of Congress and a former agriculture official say that the USDA is using sleight-of-hand tactics to get around legal mandates that have been in place for more than a century. Those mandates require federal regulators to inspect — and either pass or condemn — every live hog that arrives at a slaughterhouse and every hog carcass on the slaughter line.

“They are playing these linguistics games,” said Rena Steinzor, a food safety expert who teaches law at the University of Maryland. “What they are doing is illegal. If they have a problem with the statute because they think it’s a waste of energy for federal inspectors to eyeball every single animal, they could go to Congress. . . . The Constitution requires them to do that, not gut the law by regulation.”

The test hog-inspection program is expected to expand this summer after the agency approves new rules. Certain pork plants would have the option of using the new inspection system. Thirty-five plants plan to join the five test plants in using the new program; they would produce 90 percent of the pork consumed in the United States.

The number of federal inspectors on hog slaughter lines at the plants new to the program will be cut from 365 to 218, a 40 percent cut, according to a USDA analysis published in the Federal Register. The overall number of inspectors at those plants will drop from 400 to 288, a decline of 28 percent, according to figures provided by the USDA.

The new rules will allow the slaughter-line speeds to run as fast as the plant desires. The current cap on line speed is 1,106 hogs per hour, or 18 per minute.

Records show there have been no serious public health problems or pork food poisoning outbreaks linked to the test plants. Critics of the test plants say they have more food safety problems than the traditional plants; the USDA disputes that.

A half-dozen food safety groups, along with the USDA inspectors’ union, say they are concerned that increased line speeds and federal staff reductions on those lines will cause diseased and contaminated meat to slip by the remaining inspectors. They also cite an inherent conflict-of-interest among plant employees since they work for pork producers and not the public. Training for those workers, they point out, is also done entirely at the plant owners’ discretion.

Pat Basu, former chief veterinarian for the USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) who retired in 2018, is critical of the proposed regulation. He says the agency is using semantic tricks as it reassigns duties to plant employees that the law says inspectors should perform.

“These are word games they are playing,” Basu said. “What they are really doing is removing hogs that are diseased and contaminated. Why are these suddenly not inspections?”

USDA officials say they are modernizing the inspection process and that the new system will not violate existing laws and regulations. They say the agency has the authority to change how federal inspections are performed so long as a carcass-by-carcass inspection is performed on all of the hogs presented by the plant as fit for human consumption.

“In the proposed rules we are just giving the plant employees the opportunity to more fully execute their [food safety] plan before we make that final verification that the product is safe,” said Phil Bronstein, an assistant administrator with the FSIS.

Bronstein acknowledged that under the proposed rules, the number of USDA inspectors on the slaughter line in most large plants will be reduced from seven to three. Bronstein said the remaining inspectors would be more experienced and have a higher level of training. Also, the number of USDA inspectors who will roam large plants to ensure sanitation procedures are in place and to check on animal welfare will grow from one to two, officials said.

At least 17 members of Congress, all Democrats, have stated their opposition to the new system. “It is appalling to watch the Trump Administration and [USDA] leadership justify their gutting of hog slaughter inspections with meaningless technicalities and semantics,” Rep. Rosa L. DeLauro (D-Conn.), vice chair of the House Agriculture Appropriations Committee and chair of the Food Safety Caucus, said in a statement to The Washington Post.

“Who do they think they are fooling? This giveaway to corporate special interests means company-based employees will carry out responsibilities that are currently performed by government inspectors.”

Defining inspection

In addition to the term “condemnation,” other transferred tasks have also been given different names under the proposed new program, records show.

For example, when plant workers have examined a hog’s head and internal organs, looking for and removing signs of disease and contamination, they have “trimmed dressing defects and contamination, and identified pathology defects on the carcasses,” the proposed regulation says. They have not inspected the animal, the USDA says.

“The agency has trivialized what we have done and what we do by calling it sorting and other consumer protections,” said Charles “Stan” Painter, chairman of the National Joint Council of Food Inspection Locals, which represents inspectors. “The plant workers are clearly expected to do food safety inspections.” Painter said, given the increased role that plant workers will have on slaughter lines, he believes federal inspectors are “now nothing more than window dressing at the end of the line.”

The USDA has long used different terminology for the same tasks, depending on whether they were performed by federal inspectors or employees in the test plants. But it has become more steadfast in asserting the need for others to adopt its language, and the proposed new inspection system has focused attention on the matter.

The proposed regulation emphasizes that plant employees’ primary jobs involve “non-food safety standards concerned primarily with diseases of no public health significance.”

However, records show that nearly every transferred task involves food safety issues. For example, when plant workers are removing defects, such as blemishes, from a carcass, they might also trim abscesses that could be a sign of a serious disease or trim spots with fecal contamination that may contain dangerous pathogens.

When they remove internal organs and examine them, they are looking for signs of disease such as septicemia, which would mean the entire carcass could be filled with harmful bacteria.

[After outcry, USDA will no longer require scientists to label research ‘preliminary’]

“They are, in a sense, performing part of the inspection process, doing a pre-screening,” said Daniel Kovich, director of science and technology with the National Pork Producers Council. “Yes, they are looking at it and they are supposed to move things from the line that are not supposed to pass inspection. But only FSIS can inspect an animal.”

In an interview, USDA officials acknowledged that many of the tasks handled by plant workers would be related to food safety but said they are not inspections.

Although there is no cap on how fast line speeds may run, the USDA anticipates about a 12.5 percent increase at the large plants under the new system, records show.

Zach Corrigan, an attorney with the nonprofit advocacy group Food and Water Watch, said that means the fewer remaining inspectors would need to examine an average of 6.1 heads per minutes versus about 2.7 heads per minute in the traditional system.

Corrigan said that the new system places a heavy burden on the USDA inspectors who remain on the line and must inspect every carcass. He said the new system will sometimes make it impossible for the USDA to comply with the law.

“The definition of inspection is a ‘critical appraisal,’ ” said Corrigan, citing a 2000 court case that dealt with USDA inspections. “That legal threshold cannot be met when you remove inspectors from the lines and you increase the line speeds.” He called the USDA’s varying terms for the same food safety tasks “Orwellian doublespeak.”

The USDA said a 2002 legal ruling found that the hog test program did not violate the Federal Meat Inspection Act. However, that court decision was limited to the test program and said it “may not necessarily foreshadow the outcome of judicial review of such future regulations.”

The USDA says only a federal inspector or veterinarian has the power to place the department’s mark of inspection on the pork — under the traditional and the alternative new system.

The department also says the word “inspection” is a technical term, and can only be applied to situations in which a USDA inspector or veterinarian has performed a food safety oversight task. At meat plants, veterinarians are typically the highest ranking federal official.

In response to a recent Washington Post article that said the proposed rules would shift much of the power and responsibility for food safety inspections at hog plants to plant employees, the USDA wrote: “By law, only federal inspection personnel conduct inspections of animals, carcasses and parts — and USDA inspection personnel inspect every carcass and part before it leaves the slaughterhouse and processing plant.”

However, inside the test pork plants, USDA inspectors use the term inspector — as in “TS [trimming and sorting] inspector” — to refer to their plant employee counterparts. For example, in a 2013 citation for a food safety violation, a USDA inspector said a diseased hog had “passed all three of your TS inspectors” without them spotting the problem and the carcass had to be condemned.

And in job advertisements, owners of the test pork plants consistently call some employees inspectors or use the word inspector in job descriptions. In a recent job posting by JBS, “quality control inspector” was used as a job title, and it said work tasks include performing “various quality control functions including but not limited to line inspection, audits.” JBS did not respond to several requests for comment.

Spotting problems

Five USDA inspectors said in sworn affidavits, taken by the nonprofit Government Accountability Project, that plant workers routinely miss problems in the test plants that they believe are potential food hazards.

They also said plant workers aren’t in a position to stand up to plant supervisors when they do spot problems.

“On numerous occasions, I witnessed them fail to spot abscesses, lesions, fecal matter and other defects that would render an animal unsafe or unwholesome,” said one inspector, who was not named. “Furthermore, plant inspectors don’t actually want to shut off the line to deal with the problems they spot on the job. . . . Obviously their employer will terminate them if they do it too many times.”

Outside evaluations of the test plants have exposed problems. The most recent review was done in 2018 by Food & Water Watch. In its assessment, the group compared USDA inspection reports from the five test plants with those of five comparably sized traditional plants.

The group received copies of citations from 2013 to 2016 through a Freedom of Information Act request. In all, more than 3,500 citations were issued by USDA inspectors to the 10 plants. Food and Water Watch determined that 73 percent of citations issued for a carcass contaminated with feces, bile, hair or dirt were at the five test plants.

In the five test plants, 32 citations were issued after inspectors spotted carcasses that were “so infected that consumption of the meat may cause food poisoning.” Five comparably sized traditional hog plants received no citations for this offense, which is considered to be one of the most serious food safety violations because it can lead to possible recalls and food-poisoning outbreaks.

Carmen Rottenberg, who runs the FSIS, said the evaluation was not a meaningful comparison. She said citations to the test plants were higher because plant workers had assumed more responsibilities. When they fail to properly perform these new jobs, she said, the plants are then cited for those failures.

“We are holding the plants accountable for a lot more tasks,” Rottenberg said.

Inspection reports illustrate some of the problems USDA inspectors found with the work done by plant employees.

At one test pork plant in Michigan, employees assigned to remove sick and diseased live hogs overlooked one that had collapsed and died, then presented it to USDA inspectors as fit for slaughter.

At an Illinois test plant, plant workers failed to identify more than a dozen abscesses in the internal organs of a slaughtered hog — a clear sign that the entire carcass was contaminated with dangerous bacteria.

And in Minnesota, employees at a test plant overlooked patches of yellow and green material on the chest wall and hindquarters of a hog carcass. It was fecal matter that could have contained dangerous pathogens.

The Food & Water Watch evaluation followed two independent government audits of the test program that were critical of the alternative inspection system. In 2013, the USDA’s inspector general found that three of the five test plants were among the worst in the nation for food safety and sanitary problems. Also in 2013, the Government Accountability Office raised food safety concerns due to the faster line speeds in those plants.

In the USDA’s self assessment the following year, the agency said its data showed the test plants “are performing as well as comparable large [traditional] market hog establishments and are meeting FSIS expectations.”

Rep. Marcy Kaptur (D-Ohio) and 16 other Democratic lawmakers opposed to the new inspection system asked the USDA inspector general’s office last month to investigate whether the department properly disclosed data on worker safety during the public review and comment period for the proposed regulations.

In a statement to The Post, Kaptur cited Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data that say 1 in 6 Americans get sick and 3,000 die due to foodborne diseases each year: “If we are to improve those numbers, we cannot hand over the integrity of inspections to an industry focused more on profit and less on human and animal welfare.”"
Ingraham exclusive: Homeland Security boss defends against family-separation accusations at border,https://www.foxnews.com,['Victor Garcia'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/ingraham-exclusive-dhs-head-defends-against-family-separation-accusat-at-the-border,"The acting head of the Department of Homeland Security is disputing accusations that U.S. authorities are continuing to separate children from their families.

""First of all, that is not happening. We're separating children in maybe one case a day out of the 3,000 families arriving,"" Kevin McAleenan said Thursday in an exclusive interview on Fox News' ""The Ingraham Angle.""

""It's very rare,"" he added. ""It's for the safety of the child first and foremost.""

US CLOSES TEXAS PROCESSING CENTER AMID FLU OUTBREAK AFTER TEEN MIGRANT'S DEATH

McAleenan, 47, a native of Hawaii, was appointed to DHS by President Trump in April, after the departure of former Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen. He previously served as a commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, a unit of DHS.

On Thursday's show, McAleenan responded to a clip of MSNBC host Mika Brzezinski talking about family separations on Thursday morning.

""This is our responsibility as a country and as a nation,"" Brzezinski said. ""We are not being given answers as to what is happening to small, young children, to teenagers, to girls, to boys [who were] being taken away from their families, from their parents and left alone in our custody.""

McAleenan also discussed his recent appearances on Capitol Hill asking for funding, including a hearing where Rep. Lauren Underwood, D-Ill., asked him about the effects of separating children from their families at the border. She closed by claiming that children in U.S. custody were living in poor conditions and alluded to news reports that several children in U.S. custody had died.

McAleenan told Ingraham that he objected to Underwood's depiction of the situation.

""It's a sad state of affairs in our politics but we have an actual crisis and we have solutions on the table and clarity of what the men and women on the border need from Congress and yet that is the kind of thing we are hearing,"" McAleenan said.

McAleenan also spoke about illnesses afflicting migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border.

""We are seeing younger children arriving sicker every single day. We had an H1N1 outbreak yesterday at McAllen [Texas] station, the infectious disease with the teenager who passed away on Monday. It looks like he had the flu, a very virulent strain of the flu, H1N1. We have seen measles, we've seen mumps, folks in ICE custody that are quarantined due to mumps. It's a tremendous challenge,"" McAleenan said, adding that the situation with smugglers exacerbates the illnesses."
DOJ Attorneys Reportedly Ready to Block T-Mobile/Sprint Merger,https://gizmodo.com,"['Dell Cameron', 'About The Author', 'Privacy', 'Security', 'Tech Policy', 'Email', 'Dell Gizmodo.Com', 'Xmpp', 'Dell Jabber.Ccc.De']",,,,https://gizmodo.com/doj-attorneys-reportedly-ready-to-block-t-mobile-sprint-1834961808,"Photo: Jose Luis Magana / AP

To literally no one’s surprise, the head of the Federal Communications Commission on Monday announced Monday that he’d recommend approving the merger of T-Mobile and Sprint. But it now looks as if the Justice Department’s own attorneys vehemently oppose the merger.



Reuters reported Wednesday that the DOJ’s antitrust division has recommended filing a lawsuit to block the $26.5 billion deal. Citing two sources familiar with the matter, the news agency said the division’s staff have long been “skeptical” of the proposed merger, in that it does not appear to be in the best interests of consumers.

Per Reuters: “T-Mobile has a reputation for aggressively seeking to cut prices and improve service to woo customers away from market leaders Verizon Communications Inc and AT&T Inc, and staff may want to preserve that dynamic.”

Ajit Pai, the FCC chairman, said earlier that commitments by T-Mobile and Sprint to close “the digital divide in rural America” and advance “United States leadership in 5G, the next generation in wireless connectivity,” has persuaded him to approve the deal.

FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr—only days after accepting an award from the nation’s largest wireless industry trade association—announced that he, too, was also swayed by the companies’ commitments and would support the chairman’s decision.

Praising his “ongoing leadership,” T-Mobile CEO John Legere thanked Pai for his support in a statement Monday, while promising the commitments T-Mobile agreed to are “verifiable, enforceable and specific.” But consumer advocacy groups and legal experts following the news disagreed entirely.

“Rather than actually examine the competitive impact, Chairman Pai’s recommended approval points to T-Mobile’s commitments and behavioral conditions,” said Yosef Getachew, media and democracy program director for Common Cause. “Not only are these commitments and conditions unenforceable and riddled with loopholes, they do nothing to address the blatant competitive harms the merger poses to consumers.”

Gigi Sohn, a counselor to former FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler, echoed those concerns in a Wired op-ed this week, writing that Legere’s assurances “are speculative, unsubstantiated, and entirely unenforceable.” Sohn went on to call T-Mobile’s vow not to raise prices for three years an “admission” that, should the merger be approved, “there would not be enough competition in the wireless market to constrain price increases.”

Pai’s announcement was also rebuked by, among others, New America’s Open Technology Institute and the Rural Wireless Association. FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, who is Democrat, compared the merger to “consolidation in airlines and with drug companies,” which she argued, “hasn’t worked out well for consumers.”

“The inadequate conditions [Pai] and his fellow GOP commissioners so readily and rapidly blessed are a tiny Band-Aid on what would be a fatal wound to wireless competition and affordability in this country,” said Matt Wood, vice president of policy at the advocacy group Free Press. “DOJ’s staff seems to get that, even if some of the political appointees leading the FCC don’t.”"

Trump's 'most transparent president' claim looks cloudy,https://www.politico.com,"['Andrew Restuccia', 'Alex Isenstadt', 'James Arkin', 'John Bresnahan', 'Burgess Everett']",05-23-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/23/trumps-transparency-1342875,"President Donald Trump declared himself “the most transparent president” during an impromptu Rose Garden appearance. | Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images white house Trump's 'most transparent president' claim looks cloudy A personally accessible president has approved several precedent-breaking retreats from public disclosure.

President Donald Trump won’t release White House visitor logs, he refuses to hand over his tax returns, he made staffers sign non-disclosure agreements and he’s balking at congressional investigators.

Yet during a Rose Garden speech on Wednesday, he again proclaimed himself “the most transparent president” in U.S. history, adding to the reporters gathered before him, “I think most of you would agree.”

Story Continued Below

It may be true that Trump reveals more of his personal thoughts and emotions than any of his predecessors. But by most other measures of presidential transparency, including the congressional oversight at issue during his White House appearance Wednesday, Trump operates behind dark-tinted windows.

The end to White House visitor logs, a way for the public to see who is getting direct access to the most powerful man in America, is a break from Obama administration practice. He’s the first president in decades not to release his tax returns. No modern White House has held as few daily press briefings as Trump’s, a ritual his Pentagon and State Department have also largely phased out. And while many presidents have battled Congressional oversight requests, Trump has dismissed the queries of House Democrats as illegitimate partisan inquests.

All of which has many critics saying that Trump has it backwards.

“It is for sure the least transparent administration in modern history,” said Robert Weissman, the president of Public Citizen, a prominent Washington consumer advocacy group.

Norm Ornstein, a longtime government reform advocate and resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, called the Trump administration “the opposite of transparent.” Trump’s statement, he deadpanned, “made me laugh -- before I cried again.”

Even by the standards of Trump’s penchant for embellishment and falsehoods, Trump’s claim of unprecedented transparency — which he and his aides have made repeatedly — is particularly outrageous to the cadre of outside groups who’ve spent the last 2.5 years clashing with an administration they view as deeply secretive.

poster=""http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201905/2659/1155968404_6039857995001_6039857592001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404"" true

There is no universal definition of government transparency. But the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service defines transparency as “the disclosure of government information” that can be used to “hold the federal government more accountable for its actions or inactions.”

Measured by that sort of standard, critics say, Trump has fallen far short.

Within the first year of Trump’s presidency, the federal government denied or censored more public information requests than at any time in the last decade. And Freedom of Information Act lawsuits intended to force the administration to turn over records reached a record high last year, increasing by nearly 70 percent compared with the last full fiscal year of President Barack Obama’s term.

“There’s only one way in which he’s the most transparent president and that’s that we can see him broadcasting his thoughts on Twitter when he gets angry in the morning,” said John Wonderlich, the executive director of the Sunlight Foundation, a government accountability group. “Otherwise, it’s ridiculous.”

White House officials counter that Trump is more accessible than any modern president, broadcasting his thoughts to his millions of followers everyday, answering shouted questions from reporters and granting regular print, television and radio interviews. By that measure, the public likely has a better understanding of Trump’s minute-to-minute opinions than they did of other recent presidents, who were often reluctant to spout off in public until their ideas had been vetted by their advisers.

Though White House aides hold up Trump as a pillar of accessibility, they have also sought to tightly control Trump’s interactions with the media. Trump’s exclusive interviews tend to be with friendly news outlets. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders last appeared in the press briefing room in April to answer children’s questions during “Take Our Daughters and Sons to Work Day,” and White House officials argued that her answers should be off the record.

Watchdog groups said accessibility alone isn’t enough to claim the transparency mantle.

“I don’t think that’s meaningful transparency,” said Liz Hempowicz, public policy director at the Project on Government Oversight, adding that the true transparency requires a government-wide commitment across federal agencies.

Hempowicz and other experts noted that the lack of transparency at federal agencies has massive consequences for the public, but often gets less attention than Trump’s headline-grabbing statements.

Just this week, for example, the Washington Post disclosed the existence of an internal Defense Department memo restricting the way the Pentagon shares information with Congress. And POLITICO recently detailed efforts by the Agriculture Department to reassign nearly all its researchers who study the economic effects of climate change, trade policy and food stamps, in what employees call a crackdown on economists whose assessments don’t square with Trump’s policies.

Then there is Trump’s categorical rejection of House Democratic oversight requests, including the extraordinary use of lawsuits to fight back against his investigators.

Trump’s claims of unprecedented transparency seem to be increasing as he grows more frustrated with the investigations encircling him. Aides and associates say Trump is furious that the release of special counsel Robert Mueller’s report has not dampened appetites for more investigation into subjects like his finances and tax returns.

“The President was fully transparent during the Mueller investigation. He made all requested White House staff available for interviews, produced tens of thousands of documents, and answered questions about the ridiculous ‘collusion’ allegations,” White House spokesman Steven Groves said in a statement. “The White House and the Administration will continue to cooperate with legitimate congressional oversight while protecting Executive Branch rights and privileges. In addition, the President and his staff engage with the press and answer their questions almost every day.”

On Wednesday, Trump lashed out at House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for accusing him of engaging in a “cover-up,” countering that his administration had cooperated extensively with Mueller’s inquiries. Trump did give current and former staffers the green-light to participate with Mueller, although he himself refused to sit for an in-person interview, answering written questions instead.

“I think most of you would agree to this,” Trump said after abruptly ending a meeting with Democrats and vowing not to work with them until they end their investigations. “I’m the most transparent president, probably, in the history of this country. And instead of walking in happily to a meeting, I walk in to look at people that had just said I was doing a cover-up. I don’t do cover-ups.”

Trump isn’t the first president to throw around transparency-related superlatives. Soon after winning the presidency, Barack Obama vowed to make his administration the most transparent in history. And he did take steps toward that goal, including through the first-ever release of White House visitor logs. But watchdog groups often complained that Obama was betraying that promise when he blocked access to records or his Justice Department prosecuted government leakers.

“The [Obama] administration’s war on leaks and other efforts to control information are the most aggressive I’ve seen since the Nixon administration,” former Washington Post editor Len Downie wrote in a 2013 report.

“It’s unwise for a president to make a statement like that” unless he can back it up, Hempowicz said of Obama’s boast, noting that good government groups criticized the 44th president throughout his time in office. “It makes it very easy for us to push back.”"
DOJ agrees to share some Mueller documents with Democrats,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Brooke Singman', 'Brooke Singman Is A Politics Reporter For Fox News. Follow Her On Twitter At']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/doj-agrees-to-share-some-mueller-documents-with-democrats,"The Justice Department has agreed to share some documents from Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation with House Intelligence Committee Democrats -- but warned that their cooperation would grind to a halt should the panel move to hold Attorney General Bill Barr in contempt.

The agreement comes amid negotiations between committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and the DOJ for the full Mueller report and underlying evidence and documents from the probe -- and effectively hits pause on Schiff's efforts to enforce a subpoena against the DOJ.

“The Department of Justice has already begun the process of identifying, locating, and reviewing the materials potentially responsive to the categories of documents [requested by the Committee],” the Justice Department said in a statement Tuesday, warning that it is a “process that will not continue should the Committee take the unnecessary and unproductive step of moving to hold the Attorney General in contempt.”

Schiff appeared to accept the Justice Department’s response while maintaining that their subpoena remains in effect.

“DOJ has accepted our offer, and will begin turning over to the Committee twelve categories of counterintelligence and foreign intelligence materials beginning this week. Our subpoena will remain in effect, and be enforced should DOJ fail to comply with the full document request,” Schiff tweeted Wednesday.

Schiff, though, said that while the Democrats are ""pleased"" they will receive documents, the Justice Department's cooperation on this specific matter is ""no substitute in any way, shape or form"" for the testimony of Mueller himself, and former White House Counsel Don McGahn.

""We have every expectation that [Mueller] is going to appear before our committee as well as the Judiciary Committee,"" Schiff told reporters Wednesday, stressing the importance of having Mueller testify in a public hearing. ""We're going to insist on that being the case as well.""

It's unclear whether Mueller will testify before any committee. Meanwhile, the agreement comes after the Judiciary Committee already voted, on party lines, to hold Barr in contempt for not turning over the unredacted Mueller report and other documents.

The president had asserted executive privilege over the files in a bid to protect them from release.

In the agreement with the House Intelligence Committee, the DOJ identified 12 categories of documents

""The Department may be in a position to discuss making them available to the Committee in relatively short order, subject to processing and reviewing"" and consultations with the intelligence community, the DOJ said.

Schiff said the ""initial production should be completed by the end of next week.""

The Justice Department already has made available a minimally redacted version of the special counsel’s report to a select group of congressional Democrats. The Justice Department said Tuesday, though, that “no Democrat has accepted the Department of Justice’s offer to review a less-redacted report at the Department of Justice.”

Qualcomm found violating antitrust laws in Californian court,https://www.notebookcheck.net,[],,,,https://www.notebookcheck.net/Qualcomm-found-violating-antitrust-laws-in-Californian-court.421396.0.html,"Californian U.S. District Court judge Lucy Koh ruled in favor of FTC, which charged Qualcomm with antitrust violations involving complete disregard of FRAND practices, forced use of proprietary modems over competing ones, and slowed adoption of competing telecommunications technologies. Qualcomm immediately appealed, but if the higher court decides another hearing is not necessary, companies like Samsung, MediaTek and Huawei could provide competitively priced alternatives.

Back in 2017, the United States Federal Trade Commission was charging Qualcomm with multiple antitrust violations such as refusal to follow FRAND practices on licensed patents, forcing OEMs to use its modems by increasing competing modem prices via royalties, and preventing the adoption of competing telecommunications technologies. Just recently U.S. District Court judge Lucy Koh from California ruled in favor of the FTC and outlined five remedies that Qualcomm needs to undertake, but the decision is not final and Qualcomm immediately appealed to a higher court.



Judge Koh came to the conclusion that “Qualcomm’s licensing practices have strangled competition in the CDMA and premium LTE modem chip markets for years, and harmed rivals, OEMs, and end consumers in the process.” If the ruling still stands after the appeal, Qualcomm will be required to respect the following five remedies:





QuWindows 10 reportedly up and running on a developer's OnePlus 6Talcomm must not condition the supply of modem chips on a customer’s patent license status and Qualcomm must negotiate or renegotiate license terms with customers in good faith under conditions free from the threat of lack of access to or discriminatory provision of modem chip supply or associated technical support or access to software.



Qualcomm must make exhaustive SEP licenses available to modem-chip suppliers on fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory (“FRAND”) terms and to submit, as necessary, to arbitral or judicial dispute resolution to determine such terms.



Qualcomm may not enter express or de facto exclusive dealing agreements for the supply of modem chips.



Qualcomm may not interfere with the ability of any customer to communicate with a government agency about a potential law enforcement or regulatory matter.



In order to ensure Qualcomm’s compliance with the above remedies, the Court orders Qualcomm to submit to compliance and monitoring procedures for a period of seven years. Specifically, Qualcomm shall report to the FTC on an annual basis Qualcomm’s compliance with the above remedies ordered by the Court.



Qualcomm’s appeal will be handled by the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court, and if it decides the case is worthy of a new hearing, the case could go on for a few more years. Judge Koh’s ruling was most likely swayed by the recent Apple / Qualcomm settlement that forced Intel to exit the 5G modem market. Limiting Qualcomm’s monopoly would open up the telecommunications market for more competitive prices from companies like Samsung, MediaTek and Huawei."
Trump’s EPA is ‘cooking the books’ to justify its attack on clean air rules,https://thinkprogress.org,[],,,,https://thinkprogress.org/trumps-epa-is-cooking-the-books-to-justify-its-attack-on-clean-air-rules/,"Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is working to distort the way it measures the benefits of some of the agency’s most impactful policies, regulations that safeguard human health by limiting air pollution. The primary beneficiary of such distortion? The coal industry.

When the government evaluates the health and financial benefits of clean air, the calculation typically incorporates the number of lives saved and the scale of reduced health impacts thanks to reducing pollution — also known as “co-benefits.” Incorporating these factors into a cost-benefit analysis forms the very foundation upon which many environmental protections are based.

But now, experts warn the EPA is opening the door to industry challenges to these clean air rules by changing the way it evaluates the long-accepted science on the risk of particulate matter — microscopic particles polluting the air that are linked to increased heart attacks, strokes, and respiratory disease.

The agency may also be laying the groundwork, experts say, for using these “biased and misleading” calculations in other policy contexts. That fear was stoked by a new EPA memo released this week, ushering in a formal process to change the way the agency calculates its cost-benefit analysis across a slew of issues, from water pollution to pesticides.

It is well-established that reducing air pollution saves lives — a fact backed up by numerous scientific studies and government reports. In fact, a 2017 report from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) found that out of all federal rules, the EPA’s had the “highest estimated benefits as well as the highest estimated costs.” The costs and benefits capture everything from the new equipment required by power plants to the co-benefits from Americans’ reduced exposure to pollution.

What’s more, regulations designed to improve air quality accounted for over 95% of the benefits from EPA rules. When it comes to fine particle pollution, OMB said the benefits of regulation “far exceed” the costs.

Nonetheless, the EPA is now arguing that the calculation used to determine the costs and benefits of air pollution regulations needs to be changed. The agency is exaggerating the costs of these rules while downplaying their ecological, climate, financial, and health benefits so that it can more easily defend its sweeping rollback of environmental protections — changes that are often in line with industry demands.

The EPA’s proposed revisions to this math would reduce the number of lives at risk from repealing the Clean Power Plan and drastically downgrade the projected benefits of retaining the Mercury and Air Toxics standards (MATS) regulating power plant pollution. By eliminating the use of co-benefits, these policy changes don’t look as bad.

“Both approaches are means by which unscrupulous agency officials can cook the cost-benefit books and distort the debate about the value of health and environmental protections,” James Pew, a staff attorney at EarthJustice, told ThinkProgress. “They’re a way to rationalize rolling back these protections, or not establishing them in the first place.”

On Tuesday, the EPA released a memo directing four agency offices to “rectify… inconsistencies” regarding the process for calculating risks and benefits. This includes offices overseeing air pollution, water pollution, land contamination (including Superfund sites), and chemicals and pesticides.

The direction, issued to staff on May 13, codifies and expands an effort to effectively “cook the books” that was initiated by former Administrator Scott Pruitt. In April 2018, Pruitt told attendees at a meeting held at the Heritage Foundation – a think tank known for promoting climate science denial – that he would stop counting the co-benefits of environmental policies.

It is “potentially the first step to a systematic attack on use of co-benefits.”

This trend in fudging the numbers goes back to 2017, when the EPA under Pruitt made what appeared to be a few small changes to a metric known as the social cost of carbon – a figure that agencies use to determine the climate benefits of a particular regulation. In this case, the EPA argued it should only have to calculate how methane emissions reductions benefit the United States alone, a complete reversal from how these costs are typically calculated.

One of the main regulations currently in the agency’s cross-hairs is the MATS rule; introduced in 2011, it established federal limits on hazardous pollution from power plants. The regulation targets chemicals like mercury that can cause serious health impacts such as tremors, respiratory failure, and death. Coal plants are the biggest emitters of this toxic pollution.

The EPA’s own calculations show these regulations save upwards of 17,000 lives each year. Yet the agency is now arguing that the policy is too costly, claiming it costs industry $9.6 billion per year while only producing up to $6 million in benefits — significantly fewer benefits than what the Obama administration said the policy creates.

According the Obama-era calculations, the MATS rule would save $80 billion, in part due the co-benefits of costs avoided through fewer hospital visits and other health care spending resulting from poor air quality.

Among these benefits are ones that come from reducing pollution 2.5 microns in diameter or smaller (PM 2.5, for context, is 30 times smaller than the width of a human hair). While pollution standards set a limit on how much of this pollution is allowed, scientists argue there is no safe level, as even the tiniest particles in very small quantities are believed to impact the brains of unborn children.

But Trump’s EPA doesn’t see it that way, arguing these co-benefits are a stretch for what can be considered cost savings — and that regulating mercury from power plants is therefore not “appropriate and necessary.”

It’s a “biased and misleading estimate of costs and benefits,” Michael Livermore, associate professor of law at University of Virginia, said during a House Energy and Commerce Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee hearing on Tuesday regarding the proposed changes to MATS.

“The purpose of cost-benefit analysis is to understand consequences of agency decisions,” Livermore told lawmakers. “By excluding a large category… [you’re] turning a blind eye to an enormous category of consequences,” he said of the number of lives at risk from pollution.

Just hours later, the EPA released its memo to expand its cost-benefit revisions.

Meanwhile, regarding the rollback of the Obama-era Clean Power Plan, the New York Times reported Monday that “the EPA plans to get thousands of pollution deaths off the books by changing its math.”

An EPA impact analysis released last August found that repealing the Clean Power Plan and replacing it with a new rule – the Affordable Clean Energy plan – would lead to an additional 1,400 premature deaths per year.

The agency was ridiculed at the time for this admission, and now appears to be trying to reverse course. By adopting a different analytical method, according to the Times, the EPA will be able to reduce this number in order to defend its rollback of the Clean Power Plan.

Many experts, however, warn that there is no scientific basis to the EPA’s reported approach of assuming there are little to no health benefits from reducing pollution as much as possible. The methodology is expected to be made public in June as part of its Affordable Clean Energy rule roll-out.

“The EPA’s current agenda is to mislead and misrepresent the harms of the current Trump rollback agenda,” John Walke, clean air director and senior attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council, told ThinkProgress.

“But,” he added, “there’s also a future dimension – to handcuff the EPA and prevent them from protecting Americans and the environment.”

Targeting the science-based economics supporting air pollution regulations “would have very, very broad impacts,” Richard Revesz, director of the Institute for Policy Integrity at New York University, told ThinkProgress.

Revesz says the EPA is undercutting the science in three ways, under what he calls the “dirty trinity” — methods that are “extraordinarily flawed and inconsistent with what administrations [both Democrat and Republican]… have done for decades.”

The first method is by calling into question the co-benefits. “I see what the agency proposed in MATS as potentially the first step to a systematic attack on use of co-benefits,” he said, pointing to the EPA’s memo released this week calling on the four offices to reevaluate their cost-benefit analysis.

The next method is by calling into question the benefit of reducing particle pollution to below the national ambient air quality standards on PM 2.5. According to Revesz, the EPA’s logic espoused by the head of air quality, Bill Wehrum, is essentially to say there’s no extra benefit of reducing levels of PM 2.5 below what’s required under the national standards. This “flies in the face” of what previous administrations have done and what science has established, Revesz said.

Finally, he said the administration is trying to call into question previous studies on the harmful health impacts of particle pollution.

The impact of such a “comprehensive attack,” said NRDC’s Walke, is that “the outcome of the agency’s tortured analysis would indicate that greater protections are not justified.”

The proposed changes aren’t just opposed by scientists, environmentalists, and legal experts. They’re also, in the context of MATS, opposed by the utility industry, which has already spent billions of dollars to upgrade its facilities to be in line with the pollution rules. If MATS were to be halted, they would risk not recuperating the costs put into these upgrades.

So why do something so widely opposed? Janet McCabe, former acting EPA air chief, was posed this very question on Tuesday. “I don’t know, but I can think of two reasons why they would do this,” she told lawmakers during the MATS hearing. One of these is to “inaugurate this new way of looking at benefits, and devaluing the full range of benefits.”

The other, she said, is that “this administration has made very clear they will do everything they can to help the coal industry, and this rule is top of that list.”

While it’s hard to know exactly what is going through the minds of EPA officials when introducing these changes, the broader theme across their actions points to an industry-friendly agenda.

Given the widespread opposition to these proposed changes, Pew said, “it appears [EPA Administrator] Wheeler and Wehrum are acting in the interests of a very narrow group of companies, such as Murray Energy, Wheeler’s former client, that want the MATS rule to be withdrawn.”

In 2016, coal giant Murray Energy filed a lawsuit asking a federal appeals court to evaluate the EPA’s finding that it was “appropriate and necessary” to regulate power plants under section 112 of the Clean Air Act. The lawsuit was seen as a way to challenge the EPA’s longstanding practice of considering co-benefits in its cost analysis for regulatory decisions.

As for the new math on the Clean Power Plan’s repeal, that too is tied to a former client of an EPA official.

In 2015, the Utility Air Regulatory Group — which is known for fighting clean air policies and lobbying against the Clean Power Plan — was represented by Wehrum, then a corporate lawyer at Hunton & Williams. The firm filed comments to the EPA on behalf of UARG, arguing that recognizing the benefits of saving lives and reducing PM 2.5 pollution below required levels “fail a common sense test.”

According to the Times this week, Wehrum echoed this logic, arguing that the premise that you can save billions by reducing pollution in areas that already meet the national standard “doesn’t make any sense.”

While the administration is taking the initiative to repeal the Clean Power Plan, it claims it is not actually going to roll back MATS itself.

Some critics remain skeptical, however, and argue that by undoing the science that supports MATS, the EPA is opening the door for industry to challenge the rule all together — why have a rule if the agency’s own math says there aren’t many benefits?

Asked whether the EPA understands it is leaving this standard legally vulnerable, McCabe said she thinks it does. “If people think the EPA is not going to be asked to move forward to vacate the rule… they are mistaken,” she said. “The request will come immediately.”

It’s a “deeply cynical strategy,” Walke told ThinkProgress of the EPA’s attempt to undo the science while at the same time claiming it wants to keep MATS in place.

Doing this could “encourage litigation” by Murray Energy and others to undo the MATS rule, Pew said. “If that litigation were successful, there would be a race to the bottom for power companies to turn off or turn down their pollution controls.”

Coal company Peabody Energy has also indicated that the end result of the agency’s reevaluation to its cost calculations could be the entire undoing of the sweeping toxic pollution rule.

The chances of this type of lawsuit being successful, however, are hard to predict. But many expect it would be a long-fought battle — and that those fighting to keep the pollution controls in place would be able to point to the EPA’s questionable cost calculations and the established science to argue in support of the rules.

“I don’t think, in the end, they’ll be able to survive judicial scrutiny,” said Revesz, who believes the intention is designed to open the door to undermine co-benefits across policy areas rather than spur litigation.

The probability that the courts would uphold the EPA’s “flawed economic analysis” is “very low” he explained, because these actions are “inconsistent with regulatory practice, economics, science. They make no logical sense.”"
Dem rebuked after calling child deaths ‘intentional’ in fiery exchange with DHS boss,https://www.foxnews.com,['Ronn Blitzer'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dem-rebuked-after-calling-child-deaths-intentional-in-fiery-exchange-with-dhs-boss,"A hearing of the House Homeland Security Committee came to a screeching halt Wednesday when a Democrat had her words struck from the record after calling the deaths of children in custody at the border an ""intentional"" policy decision.

Rep. Lauren Underwood's questioning of Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Kevin McAleenan was contentious from the beginning, when the Illinois lawmaker asked him about the effects of separating children from their families at the border. She closed by claiming that the continued poor conditions in which children allegedly were being kept, and the recent death of a fifth child in custody, showed that this was the administration's goal.

US CLOSES TEXAS PROCESSING CENTER AMID FLU OUTBREAK AFTER TEEN MIGRANT'S DEATH

""At this point, with five kids that have died, 5,000 separated from their families, I feel like, and the evidence is really clear, this is intentional,"" Underwood said. ""It's a policy choice being made on purpose by this administration, and it's cruel and inhumane.""

McAleenan fired back, disputing Underwood's characterization.

""That's an appalling accusation, and our men and women fight hard to protect people in our custody every single day,"" he said. McAleenan added that his department asked for resources prior to the latest fatality and that Congress has not responded. He also said that DHS asked for changes ""that would have prevented this from happening.""

Underwood's comments were in reference to the government's announcement that a 16-year-old Guatemalan died Monday at a South Texas Border Patrol station. He was diagnosed with the flu on Sunday at a border facility, which was then temporarily closed.

Last week, a 2-year-old died after he and his mother were detained. Government officials said the child was taken to the hospital the same day his mother reported he was sick, and he was in the hospital for weeks. On April 30, a 16-year-old boy also died after officials at a Health and Human Services detention facility noticed that he was sick.

Underwood was given an opportunity to clarify her remarks, and she said the same thing, using virtually identical language. ""With five children dead and 5,000 separated from their families, this is intentional. It's a policy choice being made on purpose by this administration, and it's cruel and inhumane,"" she reiterated.

Ranking Member Mike Rogers, R-Ala., came to McAleenan's defense, calling out Underwood for her remarks.

""Mr. Chairman, you cannot impugn the character of the witness by stating that he intentionally murders children,"" he said. ""That is completely inappropriate, and her words should be taken down. She was very explicit.""

Underwood defended herself, saying she did not use the word ""murder,"" but said that deaths were the result of policy choices.

""He has said that he stands by the policy decisions of this administration, that's what he said at the beginning of his testimony.""

McAleenan said he ""did not say that at all.""

FORMER OBAMA DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY ON INCREASING NUMBER OF BORDER APPREHENSIONS

Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., first allowed Underwood's words to remain on the record, stating that ""the language is approprite and that it should not be taken down.""

This eventually led to a vote over whether to take down Underwood's words from the record.

After a 9-7 vote, Underwood's words were taken down.

Underwood later took to Twitter to comment on what happened.

""For over a year, it’s been clear that policies at the border have harmed the physical and mental health of migrant children,"" she said. ""I believe, at this point, failure to change these broken policies based on that knowledge is intentional and unacceptable.""

USDA farms out economists whose work challenges Trump policies,https://www.politico.com,"['Liz Crampton', 'Quint Forgey', 'Burgess Everett', 'John Bresnahan', 'Nancy Cook']",05-22-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/22/usda-agriculture-economists-trump-policies-1340168,"Following Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue's announcement of a staff relocation within the department, employees have been wondering who would be able to stay in Washington. | Jacquelyn Martin/AP Photo agriculture USDA farms out economists whose work challenges Trump policies Those who examine the impact of tariffs, climate change and taxes on rural America are among employees being relocated.

The Agriculture Department is moving nearly all its researchers into the economic effects of climate change, trade policy and food stamps – subjects of controversial Trump administration initiatives – outside of Washington, part of what employees claim is a political crackdown on economists whose assessments have raised questions about the president’s policies.

Since last year, employees in the department’s Economic Research Service have awaited news of which members of their agency would be forced to relocate, after Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue stunned them by declaring he was moving most of the agency to a location outside the capital. The announcement sparked claims that Perdue was trying to pressure economists into leaving the agency rather than move their families.

Story Continued Below

On March 5, the department began notifying people who were allowed to stay in Washington, but didn’t provide a comprehensive list, only telling employees in person if they made the cut.

But current and former employees compiled one anyway, covering all 279 people on staff, 76 of whom are being allowed to stay in Washington.

The current and former employees, all of whom requested anonymity out of fear of retaliation, say the specialties of those who are being asked to move corresponds closely to the areas where economic assessments often clash with the president’s policies, including tax policies, climate change, and the farm economy. The list, shared exclusively with POLITICO, shows a clear emphasis was placed on keeping employees whose work covers relatively non-controversial issues like crop planting over those whose research focused on areas sensitive to the administration.

“This was a clear politicization of the agency many of us loved for its non-partisan research and analysis,” a current ERS employee told POLITICO, claiming that department leaders picked those whose work was more likely to offend the administration and forced them to move “out or quit.”

A former researcher who left last month in anticipation of being moved put it this way: “You can draw the conclusion that these are the less valued activities that are undertaken by ERS. They view ERS as being useful in that it produces data and statistics that can inform policy but the research that’s done by the economists and geographers and statisticians at ERS is less valuable and that they’re not concerned with a significant deterioration in ERS’ ability to do research.”

A USDA spokesman declined to directly address the employees’ allegation of political bias, but provided a written statement from Perdue saying that the moves were not prompted by the work being done by ERS

“None of this reflects on the jobs being done by our . . . employees, and in fact, I frequently tell my Cabinet colleagues that USDA has the best workforce in the federal government,” Perdue said. “These changes are more steps down the path to better service to our customers, and will help us fulfill our informal motto to ‘Do right and feed everyone. . .”

“We don’t undertake these relocations lightly, and we are doing it to improve performance and the services these agencies provide. We will be placing important USDA resources closer to many stakeholders, most of whom live and work far from Washington, D.C. We will be saving money for the taxpayers and improving our ability to retain more employees in the long run. And we are increasing the probability of attracting highly-qualified staff with training and interests in agriculture, many of whom come from land-grant universities.”

But employees claim the department’s leadership, including Perdue, turned against the research service after an estimate early last year suggested that the Republican-backed tax plan would largely benefit the wealthiest farmers.

Perdue’s decision to move ERS came several months after news outlets highlighted the USDA study on the Republican tax changes. In response to Perdue’s move, cities from all over the country submitted bids to host the ERS and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, which will also move. The finalists, announced May 3, were the greater Kansas City area, North Carolina‘s Research Triangle Park and multiple locations in Indiana.

Accompanying his announcement of a final selection, which is expected as early as this week, Perdue has promised to provide Congress with a cost-benefit analysis detailing why USDA says the move makes financial sense.

The impending announcement comes as pressure builds on Capitol Hill to stop the move. On Thursday, the House Appropriations Committee is scheduled to consider a spending bill that includes a provision barring the Agriculture Department from moving the two agencies out of the national capital zone. It also would block Perdue’s decision to put ERS under the control of USDA’s chief economist, a move that placed oversight of the agency closer to the secretary’s office.

Employees said that moving nearly all researchers out of Washington would have a clear impact on the agency’s work. Researchers said they usually draw on information from other USDA divisions, members of Congress and Washington-based stakeholder groups, which would be more difficult from a remote location. Allowing 76 members of the agency to stay in Washington while the other left also impacts morale, they said, and limits collaboration.

Among the employees staying in Washington are senior analysts who conduct global market and crop-outlook estimates and administrative personnel. According to the list, approximately 49 percent of agricultural economists will be allowed to remain in Washington, compared with 14 percent of researchers.

Rumors had been swirling among staff for months about who would be allowed to remain in Washington when all ERS employees were called into an auditorium in March to be briefed by Acting Administrator Chris Hartley. He then read aloud the names of those who qualified to stay. But it wasn’t until employees compiled a full roster of who was staying and going that they got a clear picture of how the agency would be split up.

Decisions on who would stay in Washington were made by ERS leadership and approved by Perdue, according to a “Frequently Asked Questions” document distributed at the March meeting. The FAQ states that “every ERS employee had the ability to provide input” on the move. Senior managers “proposed critical ERS functions” that they believed needed to remain in Washington.

Some employees said that description of the decision-making process validates their concerns that Perdue was behind the move.

“They went in and handpicked who they wanted and called them ‘critical,’” said a current ERS employee.

Neil Conklin, a former senior administrator at ERS under the George W. Bush administration, said the agency stands to be fundamentally changed by the relocation.

“This is going to be very destructive of the agency, as certainly as we’ve known it,” Conklin said.

Sprint shares jump as DOJ antitrust chief Makan Delrahim remains open to potential T-Mobile deal,https://www.cnbc.com,"['Matthew J.

The Justice Department remains open to the $26.5 billion merger of T-Mobile and Sprint despite reports that it was leaning toward rejection, sources told CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin.

Makan Delrahim, head of the DOJ's antitrust division, is still talking with the companies and may be trying to find a way to support a deal despite his staff's opposition, the sources said.

Discussions about possible remedies are ongoing. But what kind of remedies — beyond what the companies committed to as part of a deal with the Federal Communications Commission — remain unclear.

Shares of Sprint jumped 4.6% in Thursday's premarket following Sorkin's report. T-Mobile shares were up nearly 1%.

Earlier this week, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, elevated to the top post by President Donald Trump in 2017, said he plans to recommend his agency approve the merger after the companies committed to not raising prices for three years.

It's possible, according to Sorkin's reporting, that the DOJ could push for more years on no price hikes, for example.

The Obama administration rebuffed earlier efforts by the companies to merge, as well as an attempted deal between AT&T and T-Mobile, on concerns that such deals would hurt competition in the wireless industry.

Dept. of Justice announces arrests in Shenandoah County heroin ring,https://www.whsv.com,['Whsv Newsroom'],,,,https://www.whsv.com/content/news/Dept-of-Justice-announces-arrests-in-Shenandoah-County-heroin-ring-510389691.html,"On Friday, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), Virginia State Police, Shenandoah County Sheriff’s Office, and Woodstock Police Department teamed up for a joint press conference to announce charges in what they call a ""heroin pipeline"" to the Shenandoah Valley.

According to U.S. Attorney Thomas T. Cullen, a federal grand jury returned six indictments this week for five people in connection with heroin that was trafficked from Maryland into Shenandoah County.

That heroin led to one fatal overdose, as well as another overdose where the victim survived.

An indictment for five people was returned under seal on May 21 and unsealed later in the week after arrests were made.

The grand jury charged 52-year-old Craig Allen Kidwell and 54-year-old Norma Lynda Kidwell, of Mount Jackson, each with one count of conspiracy to distribute and possess with the intent to distribute 100 grams or more of a substance containing a detectable amount of heroin resulting in death and resulting in serious bodily injury, as well as a count of distribution and possession with the intent to distribute resulting in death and injury.

The overdose victims were labeled as only J.H. for the victim who died and J.W. as the victim who survived with serious injury.

In addition, 52-year-old James Harold Lichliter, of Mauretown, 42-year-old Stacy Allen Marston, of Woodstock, and 42-year-old Jonathan Dale Neice, of Woodstock, were each charged with one count of distribution and possession with the intent to distribute resulting in the death of J.H. and the serious bodily injury of J.W.

""Over the last two years, more Americans have died from fatal opioid overdoses than the total number of troops killed during the Vietnam War,"" Cullen stated. ""In order to mitigate this public health crisis, we will aggressively prosecute street dealers and corrupt health-care providers whose unlawful activities directly result in harm to others.""

Cullen credited local partners in Shenandoah County for bringing the individuals to justice.

According to the indictment for each of the people involved, a Maryland-based drug trafficking network began selling controlled substances to Virginia-based traffickers around June 2017.

Those traffickers then took the drugs to Shenandoah County for redistribution.

The indictment alleges Craig Kidwell and his wife, Norma, repeatedly traveled from their Shenandoah County home to Maryland to get heroin from the Maryland drug ring. At times, the indictment says, the heroin they brought back was mixed with deadly drugs like fentanyl.

Once they had the drugs, the Kidwells allegedly transported them back to Shenandoah County, where they were distributed to others, including Lichliter, Marston, and Neice, who then redistributed them to others around Shenandoah County.

One person, J.H., died from an overdose caused by the drugs provided from this network in December of 2017, and J.W. was injured. Those two overdoses launched the Shenandoah County Sheriff's Office's investigation, which uncovered the chain of distributors and suppliers.

""The resulting indictments should serve as a warning of what will happen to those who make it their business to exploit and profit from the members of our community,"" stated Special Agent in Charge Jesse R. Fong of the Drug Enforcement Administration Washington Division. ""We will remain relentless with our local partners in holding drug dealers accountable for poisoning our citizens.""

The investigation was carried out by the DEA, Virginia State Police, the Shenandoah County Sheriff's Office, and the Woodstock Police Department.

Each person faces a minimum sentence of 20 years if convicted of their charges."
Trump declares man he appointed secretary of state 'totally ill prepared and ill equipped' for the job,https://www.aol.com,"['Aol Staff', 'Dylan Stableford', 'Yahoo News']",05-23-2019,2019,5,https://www.aol.com/article/news/2019/05/23/trump-declares-man-he-appointed-secretary-of-state-totally-ill-prepared-and-ill-equipped-for-the-job/23733748/,"President Trump on Thursday lashed out at Rex Tillerson after the former secretary of state reportedly told members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee that Russian President Vladimir Putin out-prepared Trump during their first meeting in Germany.

Trump responded by calling Tillerson incompetent.

“Rex Tillerson, a man who is ‘dumb as a rock’ and totally ill prepared and ill equipped to be Secretary of State, made up a story (he got fired) that I was out-prepared by Vladimir Putin at a meeting in Hamburg, Germany,” he tweeted. “I don’t think Putin would agree. Look how the U.S. is doing!”

If Tillerson was “totally ill prepared and ill equipped” to be the nation’s top diplomat, Trump himself would be to blame: He appointed the former ExxonMobil CEO to be secretary of state shortly after his inauguration after interviewing multiple candidates, including now-Sen. Mitt Romney. Tillerson was confirmed by the Senate eight days later.

In December 2016, when Trump was considering Tillerson for the position, the then-president-elect tweeted about him glowingly.

“Whether I choose him or not for ‘State,’” Trump wrote, “Rex Tillerson, the Chairman & CEO of ExxonMobil, is a world class player and dealmaker.”

Tillerson's' 14-month tenure — ending when Trump fired him last March — was fraught. In October 2017, he issued a public statement complimenting the president after multiple reports said that he had privately called Trump “a moron.” Shortly after taking the job, Tillerson told an interviewer that he never wanted the job as secretary of state and didn’t seek the post.

“My wife told me I’m supposed to do this,” Tillerson when asked why he had accepted the position as America’s top diplomat.

Trump also called Tillerson “dumb as a rock and lazy as hell” in a December tweet.

Presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., are targeting Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, raising questions about his time on Sears Holdings' board of directors and his relationship with the troubled company's former CEO, Eddie Lampert.

Mnuchin, who was Lampert's roommate at Yale University, was on the Sears board until December 2016, after President-elect Donald Trump picked him to join the incoming Cabinet.

Under Lampert, who led Sears from 2013 to 2018, the company closed more than 3,500 stores, shed some of its most valuable assets, including Lands' End, and laid off thousands. Sears filed for bankruptcy in October. Lampert bought Sears through an affiliate of his hedge fund ESL Investments, saving it from total liquidation.

In a four-page letter sent Thursday morning, Warren and Ocasio-Cortez asked Mnuchin a series of questions about his advisory role in Lampert's decisions.

In a video on Twitter announcing the letter to Mnuchin, Ocasio-Cortez criticized the secretary as ""a walking example of what happens when rich and powerful people put other rich and powerful people into power.""

Workers ""deserve a Treasury secretary who fights for them,"" Warren said in the video, ""not someone who spent a decade raking in cash for himself at the expense of hundreds of thousands of Sears employees.""

The presidential power to pardon is near-absolute in the Constitution -- ""except in cases of impeachment.""

But no previous recent president has pardoned a murderer. Until Trump.

Trump crossed that line this month when he pardoned Michael Behenna , who had been sentenced to prison in 2009 for unpremeditated murder in the killing of an Iraqi detainee and released on parole in 2014 after his sentence was reduced.

That Trump is considering other pardons for military crimes on a short timeline before Memorial Day took the Department of Justice and the Pentagon by surprise and added new context to the pardon power, which he's already used to reward political allies and send political messages.

Here's a look at the history and practice of presidential pardons for service members.

Trump's praise for war crimes, shooting deserters

JUST WATCHED Trump tweets debunked legend about US general Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump tweets debunked legend about US general 01:25

This issue first and foremost recalls Trump's repeated endorsement of behavior that could easily be classified as war criminal.

During the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump admiringly repeated an apocryphal story about Gen. John Pershing shooting Muslim prisoners with bullets dipped in pig blood -- because it violated Muslim law -- in the Philippines more than 100 years ago

wasn't a true story, but the point is that Trump liked it. He liked the idea of US troops killing 49 prisoners and disrespecting their religion in order to make the 50th tell other people what had happened. It probably wasn't a true story, but the point is that Trump liked it. He liked the idea of US troops killing 49 prisoners and disrespecting their religion in order to make the 50th tell other people what had happened.

It would also be a war crime to shoot prisoners.

Trump said US soldier Bowe Bergdahl, who had been held as a prisoner of war for years in Afghanistan, should be shot for desertion after he walked off his base in 2009. A military court gave Bergdahl no additional prison time after he pleaded guilty.

The new chapter in the annals of Trump and military justice is the news, first reported in The New York Times, that he's considering pardons for two American service members who are anticipating trial on murder charges.

He's also looking at the case of Marines convicted of urinating on dead bodies and the case of a contractor, once employed by Erik Prince's now-defunct Blackwater security company, convicted in federal court of first-degree murder for his role in the killing of 14 Iraqis in 2007.

But it is the idea of pardons for accused service members who have not yet gone to trial and been convicted that is raising the most concern for some military law experts.

Army Maj. Matthew Golsteyn divulged his role in the killing of a bomb maker in Afghanistan during a job interview with the CIA and subsequently in a Fox News interview. The Army says the killing was premeditated and Golsteyn is set to stand trial. He could face the death penalty.

Navy SEAL Edward Gallagher is charged with stabbing a wounded man to death, shooting at a male and female noncombatant and obstructing justice while deployed in Iraq. His own teammates turned him in, but Gallagher, who has pleaded not guilty, has found defenders in the media and on Capitol Hill.

Navy SEAL Chief Edward Gallagher is charged with murder of Iraqi civilians.

He was allowed to leave the brig after Trump tweeted about the case. The President also tweeted about Golsteyn.

""At the request of many, I will be reviewing the case of a 'U.S. Military hero,' Major Matt Golsteyn, who is charged with murder. He could face the death penalty from our own government after he admitted to killing a Terrorist bomb maker while overseas. @PeteHegseth @FoxNews""

The closest a modern president has come to a pardon for war crimes was Richard Nixon's treatment of William Calley, who was convicted of premeditated murder for his role in the Vietnam War My Lai massacre of unarmed civilians in 1968. Nixon released him to house arrest and his life sentence was commuted by Nixon's secretary of the army, Howard Calloway

The first difficulty of assessing war crimes in the US is that there is no commonly accepted definition of the term and the US is not a party to the Rome Statute, which created the International Criminal Court in 1998. In fact, the Trump administration recently revoked visas for the International Criminal Court chief prosecutor, which CNN reported was part of an effort by the US to deter ICC actions against US service members in Afghanistan.

That doesn't mean the US military is not prosecuting those suspected of war crimes, according to Chris Jenks, a law professor at the Southern Methodist University Dedman School of Law who is a former Army judge advocate. Jenks is an expert in the law of armed conflict who wrote about possible Trump pardons for the Just Security blog . He answered some questions about Trump's possible move and what it could mean for the military justice system.

What is a war crime and are US service members charged with war crimes?

Lt. William Calley walks from Fort Benning, GA. stockade, April 1, 1971. Calley was convicted for his part in the 1968 My Lai massacre incident of the Vietnam War. President Richard Nixon ordered him placed under house arrest during appeal.

""As a general proposition, when people say war crimes within the international legal community, what we're talking about is serious violations of the law of armed conflict or international humanitarian law, serious violations of the laws of war,"" said Jenks.

He pointed out that Calley was not charged with a war crime, but rather hundreds of charges of murder. Similarly, he said Sgt. Robert Bales, who killed 16 Afghan civilians , was charged with multiple counts of murder, even though, as Jenks said, ""I would tell you under international law definitions Sgt. Bales committed one or more war crimes.""

Is there any precedent for what Trump is doing?

""In terms of has there ever been an instance where the commander in chief has preemptively pardoned a US service member facing a court-martial for murder? No, I'm not aware of that,"" said Jenks.

""You have an entire military justice apparatus,"" he said, which is set up to make sure justice is served. It starts with the Navy SEALs who reported Gallagher, for example, continues through the Naval Criminal Investigative Service agents who collected evidence and the admiral who recommended that Gallagher be prosecuted.

""What's the point of having the military justice system if it's not allowed to operate?"" asked Jenks. ""What are you saying to the commanders and the judge advocates who participate in the process when you don't let the military justice process proceed?""

Are there adequate protections for US service members accused of war crimes?

Given that American service members are operating in war zones, it's important that they have protection from the US government.

""If there was ever a circumstance by which I was accused of serious wrongdoing and I was offered a choice of being prosecuted in a state court, a federal court, or a military court, I would run to a military court because of the protections and the process that it affords service members, frankly, well in excess of the protections and processes that are afforded in state and federal court,"" said Jenks.

He said there is a larger problem underlying Trump's potential pardons, which is that service members are standing accused of these crimes but also standing in judgment of each other.

""The broader unstated point is the President and those who support pardons are trying to position themselves as this is an us against them. But when you think about who is the us and who is the them -- it's US service members on both sides of this equation.""

He argued that after the criminal justice system is allowed to work, the decision to pardon becomes a matter of judgment. There is precedent for preemptive pardons, however. More on that in a moment.

Retired Army Lt. Gen. Mark Hertling said on CNN that usurping the military justice system will hurt the military as a whole.

""If you lose control of your forces, you're no longer a military force, you're just a mob,"" said Hertling, a CNN analyst.

Chelsea Manning and war crimes

Obama did not pardon but rather commuted the sentence of Chelsea Manning, the convicted leaker of classified information to WikiLeaks -- drawing widespread criticism since Manning arguably jeopardized national security. Supporters argue she uncovered US war crimes , like the killing of Iraqi civilians, including two who worked for Reuters. In that instance, perhaps proving how difficult and rare it is for the military to seek charges against its members, the only charges that were brought after an investigation into those killings were the ones against Manning for her leaks.

Unrelated to her commutation, Manning was ordered back to jail this month after refusing to testify before a grand jury as part of a federal investigation into Julian Assange and WikiLeaks.

Confederates and draft dodgers pardoned

There have been massive military-related pardons in American history. President Andrew Johnson pardoned Confederate soldiers after the Civil War . More than 100 years later, President Jimmy Carter essentially pardoned Confederate President Jefferson Davis by posthumously restoring his citizenship. Carter also, on his first day in office, pardoned draft dodgers after Vietnam."
U.S. State Department misses deadline to explain Iran arms control report: aide,https://www.reuters.com,"['Arshad Mohammed', 'Min Read']",05-23-2019,2019,5,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-iran-armscontrol/u-s-state-department-misses-deadline-to-explain-iran-arms-control-report-aide-idUSKCN1ST2VY,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department failed to meet a deadline on Thursday to provide information to three congressional committee chairmen looking into whether an annual arms control report slanted and politicized assessments about Iran, a congressional aide said.

In a May 16 letter, the Democratic chairmen of the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs, Armed Services and Intelligence committees asked Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to provide a State Department briefing and documents no later than Thursday.

The chairmen’s letter cited a Reuters article on April 17 about how the administration’s annual report to Congress on global compliance with international arms control accords provoked a dispute with U.S. intelligence agencies and some State Department officials.

The dissenting officials, sources said, were concerned that the document politicized and skewed assessments against Iran in a bid to lay the groundwork to justify military action.

A U.S. official familiar with the issue and speaking on condition of anonymity said the chairmen were to be invited to a briefing by State Department and other government experts about the report on “adherence to and compliance with arms control, nonproliferation and disarmament agreements and commitments.”

The congressional aide, also speaking on condition of anonymity, said no such communication had been received.

The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

U.S.-Iranian tensions rose following U.S. President Donald Trump’s withdrawal last year from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal and his reimposition of tough economic sanctions. They sharpened earlier this month after Trump tightened sanctions to try to eliminate Iran’s oil exports.

Strains further deepened with Saudi Arabia accusing Iran of ordering armed drone attacks on two oil pumping stations and the May 12 sabotage of four vessels, including two Saudi tankers, off the coast of the United Arab Emirates.

U.S. government sources said Washington strongly suspects militias with ties to Tehran were behind those attacks as well as a rocket strike in Baghdad’s Green Zone.

Iran denied involvement in the incidents.

In their May 16 letter to Pompeo, the three chairmen said they were “deeply concerned” the arms control report may have been produced by political appointees “disregarding intelligence or distorting its meaning.”

The State Department, they noted, was legally bound to submit to Congress a “detailed report” on compliance by the United States and other countries with international arms control accords.

Instead, they wrote, this year’s report was only 12 pages long, “contains no meaningful discussion” of U.S. and Russian compliance with such agreements and “consists largely of hypotheticals or opinion.”

Several sources told Reuters that the report made them wonder if the administration was painting Iran in the darkest light possible, much as the George W. Bush administration used bogus and exaggerated intelligence to justify its 2003 invasion of Iraq."
Veterans Affairs is changing for the better,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-24-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/op-eds/veterans-affairs-is-changing-for-the-better,"President Abraham Lincoln once said, “I am not concerned that you have fallen — I am concerned that you arise.”

Like any large organization, the Department of Veterans Affairs has seen its share of problems.

But under President Trump’s leadership, the VA is living up to Lincoln’s ideals by finding ways to fix those problems from past administrations.

When we realized our claim-appeals process was complex and inefficient, we worked with veterans service organizations, Congress, and the president to draft and pass a new law designed to fix it and put veterans first.

We launched a 24/7 White House VA hotline to help veterans cut through red tape and serve as an important feedback mechanism that lets agency leaders identify trends, spot problems more quickly, and drive improvements across the department.

And after Trump promised to give veterans more healthcare choices, we worked with Congress to do just that by passing the Maintaining Internal Systems and Strengthening Integrated Outside Networks, or MISSION, Act, which will consolidate our community care efforts into a single, simple-to-use program that puts veterans at the center of their healthcare decisions.

But perhaps the best example of VA’s continuous improvement on behalf of veterans is the progress we’ve made in expanding accessibility to, and quality of, the healthcare we deliver.

When it comes to access, a January study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that by 2017, VA had significantly shorter wait times for primary care, cardiology, and dermatology than private doctors. The study said the data it collected is “further supporting the finding that access to care has improved over time within the VA.”

That improvement came even as the VA was steadily seeing more patients.

In December, a Dartmouth study in the Annals of Internal Medicine found that care at the VA was “significantly better” than the care found in non-VA facilities in 14 of 15 categories. “We found that VHA hospitals provided the best care in most referral regions and rarely provided the worst care,” the study found.

Our focus on customer service is part of the reason for these improvements. Our Veterans Experience Office is constantly assessing our performance and giving us the feedback we need to identify and resolve problems.

That office has been so successful that the Trump administration is using it as a model to develop customer service strategies across the entire government. This summer, lessons learned at the VA will be used to develop customer service plans at more than two dozen major federal agencies.

The cornerstone of our commitment to improving customer service is our willingness to acknowledge that things aren’t perfect and that change is a good thing. That’s the attitude we have as we prepare to undergo the biggest transition in our history: implementing the MISSION Act.

Under that law, which we’ll start implementing on June 6, our community care programs will be streamlined into a single program, and veterans will be able to more easily access outside care when necessary or when VA care is simply too far away.

This landmark change won’t supplant VA or cause the quality of its care to diminish. It will support our mission by improving its ability to get veterans the care they need when and where they need it.

This Memorial Day, I urge all Americans to remember the more than 1 million service members who gave their lives for our freedom in the several wars we’ve fought during the history of this country. At the VA, we are undergoing change at a rate that hasn’t been seen since the end of World War II to improve the lives of our living veterans.

We are welcoming these challenges as the best way to live up to the charge Lincoln laid on the nation after the Civil War — that we continue “to care for him who shall have borne the battle.”

Robert Wilkie (@SecWilkie) is the secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs."
