President Trump is so eager to complete hundreds of miles of border fence ahead of the 2020 presidential election that he has directed aides to fast-track billions of dollars’ worth of construction contracts, aggressively seize private land and disregard environmental rules, according to current and former officials involved with the project.

He also has told worried subordinates that he will pardon them of any potential wrongdoing should they have to break laws to get the barriers built quickly, those officials said.

Trump has repeatedly promised to complete 500 miles of fencing by the time voters go to the polls in November 2020, stirring chants of “Finish the Wall!” at his political rallies as he pushes for tighter border controls. But the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has completed just about 60 miles of “replacement” barrier during the first 2½ years of Trump’s presidency, all of it in areas that previously had border infrastructure.

The president has told senior aides that a failure to deliver on the signature promise of his 2016 campaign would be a letdown to his supporters and an embarrassing defeat. With the election 14 months away and hundreds of miles of fencing plans still in blueprint form, Trump has held regular meetings at the White House to receive progress updates and hasten the pace, according to several people involved in the discussions.

When aides have suggested that some of his orders are illegal or unworkable, Trump has suggested he would pardon the officials if they would just go ahead, aides said. He has waved off worries about contracting procedures and the use of eminent domain, saying “take the land,” according to officials present at the meetings.

“Don’t worry, I’ll pardon you,” he has told officials in meetings about the wall.

“He said people expected him to build a wall, and it had to be done by the election,” one former official said.

Asked for comment, a White House official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the president is joking when he makes such statements about pardons.

Hogan Gidley, a deputy White House press secretary, said Tuesday that the president is protecting the country with the addition of new border barriers.

“Donald Trump promised to secure our border with sane, rational immigration policies to make American communities safer, and that’s happening everywhere the wall is being built,” Gidley said. He noted that internal criticisms of the president “are just more fabrications by people who hate the fact the status quo, that has crippled this country for decades, is finally changing as President Trump is moving quicker than anyone in history to build the wall, secure the border and enact the very immigration policies the American people voted for.”

“President Trump is fighting aggressively for the American people where other leaders in the past have rolled over, sold out, and done absolutely nothing,” Gidley said.

Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper is expected to approve a White House request to divert $3.6 billion in Pentagon funds to the barrier project in coming weeks, money that Trump sought after lawmakers refused to allocate $5 billion. The funds will be pulled from Defense Department projects in 26 states, according to administration officials who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the matter.

Trump’s determination to build the barriers as quickly as possible has not diminished his interest in the aesthetic aspects of the project, particularly the requirement that the looming steel barriers be painted black and topped with sharpened tips.

In a meeting at the White House on May 23, Trump ordered the Army Corps and the Department of Homeland Security to paint the structure black, according to internal communications reviewed by The Washington Post.

Administration officials have stopped trying to talk him out of those demands, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is preparing to instruct its contractors to apply black paint or coating to all new barrier fencing, the communications show.

Trump conceded last year in an immigration meeting with lawmakers that a wall or barrier is not the most effective mechanism to curb illegal immigration, recognizing it would accomplish less than a major expansion of U.S. enforcement powers and deportation authority. But he told lawmakers that his supporters want a wall and that he has to deliver it.

Trump talked about the loud cheers the wall brought at rallies, according to one person with direct knowledge of the meeting.

Former White House chief of staff John F. Kelly would often tell administration officials to disregard the president’s demands if Kelly did not think they were feasible or legally sound, according to current and former aides.

During a conference call last week, officials at U.S. Customs and Border Protection told engineers from the Army Corps that the hundreds of miles of fencing must be completed before the next presidential election, according to administration officials with knowledge of the call who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal communications.

“Border Patrol insists on compressed acquisition timelines, and we consent. Their goal is to get contracts awarded, not for us to get a quality contract with a thoroughly vetted contractor,” said one senior official who is concerned the agency has been hurried to hand out contracts as quickly as possible.

Military officials expect more contract protests because the arrangements have been rushed, the official added. The Army Corps already has had to take corrective actions for two procurement contracts, after companies protested.

The companies that are building the fencing and access roads have been taking heavy earth-moving equipment into environmentally sensitive border areas adjacent to U.S. national parks and wildlife preserves, but the administration has waived procedural safeguards and impact studies, citing national security concerns.

“They don’t care how much money is spent, whether landowners’ rights are violated, whether the environment is damaged, the law, the regs or even prudent business practices,” the senior official said.

This official said CBP has suggested no longer writing risk-assessment memos “related to the fact that we don’t have real estate rights and how this will impact construction.”

While Trump has insisted that the barriers be painted, the cost of painting them will reduce the length of the fence the government will be able to build. According to the internal analysis, painting or coating 175 miles of barriers “will add between $70 million and $133 million in cost,” trimming the amount of fencing the Army Corps will be able to install by four to seven miles.

In June, teams of U.S. soldiers painted a one-mile section of fence in Calexico, Calif., at a cost of $1 million. The coating, known as “matte black” or “flat black,” absorbs heat, making the fence hot to the touch, more slippery and therefore tougher to climb, according to border agents.

At Trump’s behest, the Army Corps also is preparing to instruct contractors to remove from the upper part of the fence the smooth metal plates that are used to thwart climbers. The president considered that design feature unsightly, according to officials familiar with his directives.

Instead, contractors have been asked to cut the tips of the steel bollards to leave a sharpened point. Trump had told aides this spring he thought the barrier should be spiked to instill a fear of injury.

The change in the bollard design is likely to reduce the overall length of the barrier by two to three miles, according to the administration’s cost assessments.

CBP has used a pointed design in the past, according to agency officials, either by installing a pyramid-shaped cap or making what the agency refers to as a “miter cut” in the metal.

Trump remains keen to tout incremental progress toward his wall-building commitments, and in recent weeks, top Homeland Security officials have taken to Twitter to promote their advances.

In recent days, DHS leaders including acting CBP chief Mark Morgan and the top official at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Ken Cuccinelli, have tweeted photos of border fence construction, echoing promises that 450 miles of new barrier will be completed by next year. Another senior administration official credited both men with injecting urgency, saying that “things are starting to crank away,” even though Cuccinelli’s agency is not involved in the project.

Dan Scavino Jr., the White House social media director, has asked for video footage and photos of heavy equipment digging up the desert and planting the barriers so that administration officials can tweet about it, aides said.

Administration officials involved in the project also defended the president’s use of eminent domain laws to speed up the process.

“There is no more constitutionally permissible public purpose for eminent domain than national defense,” said a current administration official who was not authorized to speak on the record about the contracting process.

“Our intention is to negotiate with every property owner, and every property owner will receive fair market value for the land,” the official said. “But the land that is needed is not replaceable land. This is not like building a hospital or even a school. There is no alternative land to the border.”

CBP and Pentagon officials insist they remain on track to complete about 450 miles of fencing by next year’s election. Of that, about 110 miles will be added to areas where there is currently no barrier. The height of the structure will vary between 18 and 30 feet, high enough to inflict severe injury or death from a fall.

The chief of the Border Patrol’s strategic planning and analysis office said a final decision had not been made on the black paint or other design requests from the White House.

“Ultimately, we’ll do our assessment and determine what is the best for us operationally,” said Brian Martin, the office’s chief, adding that the agency is waiting to get border agents’ feedback on whether the coating would be beneficial.

Martin also said CBP would continue to install anti-climb panels on portions of the barrier already under contract, calling the design “very vital to overall effectiveness.” But he and other CBP officials said that some new portions of barriers will have the panels and that others will not, a determination that he said will be guided by necessity, not aesthetics.

In recent months, Trump has urged the Army Corps to award a contract to a company he favors, North Dakota-based Fisher Industries, though the firm has not been selected. Fisher has been aggressively pushed by Trump ally Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), who briefly held up the confirmation of a Trump budget office nominee last month in an attempt to put pressure on the Army Corps.

Cramer demanded to see the contracts awarded to Fisher’s competitors, lashing out at the “arrogance” of the Army Corps in emails to military officials after he was told the bidding process involved proprietary information that could not be shared.

The CEO of Fisher Industries is a major backer of Cramer and has donated to his campaigns.

[These photos show private border barriers being built on private land]

Cramer visited the El Paso area Tuesday to tour border facilities and view a span of privately funded border fencing Fisher built as a showcase for what it claims are superior construction techniques. Cramer posted videos of his tour to social media. He undertook the tour “to see the crisis at our border firsthand.”

The senator had asked Lt. Gen. Todd Semonite, the commander of the Army Corps, to meet him at the site, but Semonite is traveling in Brazil, where the Trump administration has offered to help fight wildfires in the Amazon.

In an email to The Post, Cramer said he met with CEO Tommy Fisher on Tuesday at a span of fencing the company built on private land; he said Army Corps officials joined them at the site.

“The agents on the ground said the walls have been very helpful in slowing illegal crossings,” Cramer wrote. “I’m not a wall-building expert, but at the pace of the last few years, it’s hard to see how 450 miles gets built with the same process. . . . I wish DHS would engage a whole bunch of builders and innovators rather than rely on the same decades old bureaucracy.”

Cramer said he shared the president’s “frustration” with the pace of progress.

Several administration officials who confirmed the White House’s urgency said they expected to be able to deliver on the president’s demands because the actual construction of the barriers is typically the last step in the process.

“There is a long lead time to acquiring land, getting permits and identifying funding,” the official said. “I think you will see a dramatic increase in wall construction next year because all of the work over the past two years has primed the pump.”"

The party at the Trump International Hotel, Washington, DC, could wind up costing more than $30,000, according to The Washington Post, which first reported on the party and its details. A Justice Department official told CNN that the party is not an official Justice Department event and will be paid out of Barr's pocket.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Carlos Giusti/AP Carlos Giusti/AP

As a major storm heads for Puerto Rico, the Department of Homeland Security and its Federal Emergency Management Agency said Tuesday they will move $271 million in funds to support President Trump's border enforcement efforts.

The Department of Homeland Security said it will transfer the emergency funds — including $155 million from FEMA's disaster relief fund — to support new Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention beds as well as facilities for related court cases, according to documents obtained by NPR.

In a July notification to Congress about the transfer, DHS said the $155 million comes from recoveries of prior year funds and that ""absent significant new catastrophic events"" the department believes the fund will still have enough money to operate.

Congressional Democrats slammed the move on Tuesday, which comes at the peak of hurricane season and as Tropical Storm Dorian was poised to reach hurricane levels.

""The Trump administration's plan to divert money away from FEMA at the start of hurricane season to continue its efforts to separate and jail migrant families is backwards and cruel,"" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said. ""Taking these critical funds from disaster preparedness and recovery efforts threatens lives and weakens the government's ability to help Americans in the wake of natural disasters. Congress appropriated these funds to meet the American peoples' priorities and I strongly oppose this effort to undermine our constitutional authority.""

DHS alerted Congress to the move in a 15-page notification dated July 26, which NBC first reported earlier Tuesday. The agency is required to give Congress a 30-day notice to the plans.

Democrats, opposed to the move, waited to respond until the end of that notification period in hopes of delaying the costly action, a congressional source familiar with the plans said.

""I have significant concerns about the intended use of funds, and consequently, about the tradeoffs between that use and activities that would otherwise be funded from the source accounts,"" California Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard, chair of a House Appropriations subcommittee, told DHS Secretary Kevin McAleenan in an Aug. 23 letter.

Roybal-Allard said the the reprogramming was unnecessary and the Trump administration was overstepping its authority. She noted that DHS components such as the U.S. Coast Guard could be hampered by the move.

She added she was concerned about implementation of the agency's immigration enforcement operations, which often ignores its budget directives from Congress and lack transparency. She urged McAleenan to work with the House Appropriations Committee to restore their partnership.

""I am greatly concerned that during the course of this administration, there has been a growing disconnect between the will of Congress, as represented by ICE funding levels in enacted appropriations bills signed by the President, and the Department's Immigration enforcement operations, which often lack justification,"" Roybal-Allard said.

Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., also slammed the move Tuesday.

""Once again, this administration is endangering America by moving funds away from emergency management for their extremist border agenda,"" he said. ""President Trump and his administration are not just endangering the lives of the children and families they seek to harm in the name of deterrence. By shortchanging preparedness, they're endangering the lives of millions of Americans who live in hurricane zones as well.""

The DHS notification to Congress expired on Sunday, the agency said in a statement Tuesday. The Department also defended the move, saying it is necessary to deal with the influx of migrants.

""Given the rise of single adults crossing the border, ICE has already had to increase the number of detention beds above what Congress funded,"" DHS said in its statement. ""Without additional funding for single adult detention beds and transportation from the U.S. Border Patrol to ICE detention facilities, ICE will not be able to support the influx of migrants from U.S. Customs and Border Protection apprehensions.""

In its notification, DHS cited ""a security and humanitarian crisis on the southern border"" and the ""high volume of aliens presenting themselves at ports of entry or entering illegally ... and being released into the interior of the United States while they wait sometimes years for a final resolution of their case."" The shift in the funds would help DHS address the ""crisis,"" the department says, under authority provided in the fiscal year 2019 DHS appropriations act.

As a result, DHS said it will transfer funds from its FEMA disaster relief fund and other accounts to the new border effort.

Of the overall $271 million total, the agency said it will move $155 million to establish and operate temporary Migrant Protection Protocol, or MPP, Immigration Hearing Facilities along the Southwest border. Another $116 million will be used to pay for new detention beds, the agency said.

""MPP court docket backlogs will continue to grow and ICE will not be able to effectively and efficiently move single adult migrants between detention centers and courtrooms without the funding,"" the agency said. ""This realignment of resources allows DHS to address ongoing border emergency crisis by alleviating the surge along the Nation's Southwest Border while minimizing the risk to overall DHS mission performance.""

Supporters of the administration's immigration policies say Democrats have left the administration little choice but to take this action.

Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies for the Center for Immigration Studies, who is in regular discussions with the administration, said the transfer of the funds is necessary because ICE is so over budget due to the border crisis. They have to find the money from somewhere because Congress hasn't given them what it needs, she said.

""ICE's priority caseload is growing, but the Democratic majority in the House does not support the level of enforcement that they consider to be the bare minimum for public safety and maintaining the most basic integrity of the law,"" she said.

""The border influx has strained ICE capacity,"" she said. ""Under the law, their detention capacity is set by Congress. They have to balance the criminal cases, border cases and other priorities like worksite operations and fugitives. And on top of that some people are mandatory to detained, such aggravated felons and prior deportees.""

Why some lesbians don’t want Pete Buttigieg to be president,https://www.politico.com,['Maggie Severns'],08-27-2019,2019,8,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/08/27/lesbians-pete-buttigieg-2020-president-1475900,"Several lesbian activists say that while they are glad South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg is running for the Democratic nomination, they most want a woman to be president in 2020, after Hillary Clinton’s stinging loss in 2016. | Mary Schwalm/AP Photo 2020 Elections Why some lesbians don’t want Pete Buttigieg to be president Lesbian political activists are divided over which glass ceiling to aim for in the 2020 presidential race.

Campbell Spencer, a lesbian and political consultant, moved to Washington in the 1990s to work in LGBTQ advocacy. She wooed gay and lesbian voters for Al Gore, worked a stint in the Obama White House and now serves on the board of the LGBTQ Victory Fund, which this year issued its first-ever endorsement of a presidential candidate: Pete Buttigieg.

But so far, Kamala Harris has wowed Spencer more than any other candidate in the race.

Story Continued Below

“Mayor Pete, he’s a trailblazer,” Spencer said in an interview. “But I’m one of these women who thinks we are way overdue for having a woman in the White House. That’s a lens through which I’m going to filter my decision.”

Buttigieg, the openly gay mayor of South Bend, Ind., has drawn notable support from gay voters and donors for his presidential bid. But interviews with a dozen prominent Democrats in the LGBTQ community spotlight a remarkable collision of goals and ideals in the community of lesbian political activists this year. As the 2020 field slowly winnows, people are divided over which glass ceiling to break first.

The majority of the women POLITICO interviewed for this story did not want to speak on the record, citing a desire not to damage Buttigieg’s campaign. But especially when compared with the laborious ascent of Hillary Clinton, Buttigieg’s swift rise in national politics hints of male favoritism, some said. Others applauded his run — but feel more strongly about the need to elect a female president.

“It feels like a slap in the face to just go directly to the white gay guy, when for decades you’ve been trying to elect a woman and it didn’t happen last time,” said one lesbian Democrat who works in national politics. “If Pete Buttigieg is elected it won’t feel like a vindication of Hillary Clinton. If a woman is elected, it will.”

LGBTQ voters made up a relatively small 6 percent of the electorate in the 2018 midterm elections but voted overwhelmingly for Democratic candidates, according to exit polls. And gay donors are a formidable source of campaign funds in the Democratic Party: One in six of Barack Obama’s top campaign bundlers in 2012 were openly gay, according to a Washington Post analysis at the time.

The LGBTQ community has been an important launch pad for Buttigieg’s presidential bid. He has fundraised at the homes of several prominent gay donors — such as television producers Ryan Murphy and Richie Jackson, each of whom have hosted Buttigieg for events in their homes this year — and received campaign checks from power players including Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes and lesbian megadonor Laura Ricketts.

But the broad 2020 Democratic field includes historic diversity and choice for LGBTQ voters looking for new representation in the White House, or at least on the Democratic debate stage.

“There are black gay men and Latina lesbians — we have all these identities,” said Annise Parker, the former Houston mayor who is now president and CEO of the LGBTQ Victory Fund. “I talk to donors who are really glad that Pete’s running, but want Julián Castro to be on the debate stage. Or who say, ‘I want Cory Booker or Kamala Harris to be on stage.’ I say that’s a great thing.”

Parker, who became the first lesbian elected to lead a major American city only a decade ago, said she plans to vote for Buttigieg. But she also feels the pull of electing the first female president.

“As a woman, as a lesbian, as someone who was all in for Hillary Clinton and as someone who was a historic first myself, I would love to see a woman at the top of the ticket,” Parker said.

“And talking with other women inside the community and not, we understand the importance of Pete’s candidacy — but dammit, we’re half the population. It’s time” for a woman president, Parker continued.

Several lesbian donors and activists interviewed by POLITICO said they see in this election a continuation of the gender politics of 2016, when Clinton’s nomination was a vindicating moment for many Democratic women — and Trump’s position as the GOP nominee heightened the stakes of the race, as well as the burn of Clinton’s loss.

“To have a woman candidate finally running for president was extraordinarily galvanizing to substantial portions of the women’s community and the lesbian community,” said Elyse Cherry, a Massachusetts-based lesbian community activist and former member of Clinton’s New England finance committee. “When she lost, people were even more galvanized.”

Cherry pushed to build a movement for same-sex marriage in Massachusetts, starting in the early 1990s when the idea was a political outlier. She chaired the board for MassEquality, which advocated for the state’s gay marriage law and worked to guard it from challenges in the years after it was enacted.

Cherry plans to vote for her senior senator, Elizabeth Warren.

“Having a woman, finally, as our president is important to me,” Cherry said. “The mistake is to suggest that we all stay in one lane — for example that if you’re gay you should be supporting gay candidates, or if you’re a woman you should be supporting women candidates.”

LPAC, an organization that focuses on building power among LGBTQ women, has not endorsed a candidate, but its endorsement discussions will begin at an upcoming board meeting, the group’s president Stephanie Sandberg said, adding that there is a ""strong possibility"" that LPAC will endorse a candidate.

Nabeela Rasheed, a Chicago-based lawyer and activist backing Buttigieg, said “there is absolutely a conversation that’s happening” among lesbian donors in her area about the value of supporting a female candidate over Buttigieg.

“I don’t think the county is ready for a West Coast Democrat, and a female at that. And I don’t think this country can take an East Coast female either. They need someone who understands Main Street,” Rasheed said. So Rasheed — who is of Pakistani descent — has been raising money for Buttigieg and trying to introduce as many women of color to his campaign as possible.

Buttigieg surprised observers by surging to national prominence this spring and raising $24 million between early April and the end of June, the most money of any candidate in the field.

One foundation for his success was a bloc of openly gay male donors and fundraisers who threw their support behind his campaign early in the race. Among the people who have already raised more than $25,000 for Buttigieg’s campaign were Terrence Meck, co-founder of the nonprofit The Palette Fund; and Alex Slater, founder of the Washington, D.C.-based Clyde Group.

Other high-profile gay donors, such as software entrepreneur Tim Gill and philanthropist David Bohnett, have donated to former Vice President Joe Biden, who was an early proponent of same-sex marriage in Washington.

Kelly Dermody, a former Hillary Clinton bundler and employment lawyer who has represented women in sexual harassment cases, said that while Buttigieg’s candidacy is “exciting,” federal lawmakers who are running have more experience.

Dermody is backing Harris, who she believes is the strongest candidate, in part because of her experience as a woman and person of color. She said that one highlight of the 2020 campaign for her has been Harris’ husband, Douglas Emhoff, a frequent presence at campaign stops and an unbridled booster of his wife on social media.

“It’s just been really nice seeing him at various events and see what it looks like to have a female leader have the support of a strong male partner,” Dermondy said. “He has his own job and he’s a real star lawyer in his own world, but he also has embraced this [campaign].”

CLARIFICATION: This story has been updated to better reflect Campbell Spencer's preferences on the 2020 Democratic field. So far, she is most impressed by Kamala Harris, but she says she has not made a final decision about who to support."
Joe Walsh Says Trump Is ‘Unfit’ to Be President. Some Say the Same About Him.,https://www.nytimes.com,"['Matt Stevens', 'Annie Karni']",08-27-2019,2019,8,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/27/us/politics/joe-walsh-president-racist-tweets.html,"Mr. Walsh has not deleted his offending tweets, choosing instead to apologize for some of them. But his long, searchable trail means Mr. Walsh has spent the opening days of his campaign addressing his own record rather than mounting a coherent attack on Mr. Trump.

“I wouldn’t call myself a racist, but I would say, John, I’ve said racist things on Twitter,” Mr. Walsh said in an interview with the MSNBC host John Heilemann on Monday.

The difference between him and the president, Mr. Walsh said in an interview with ABC, is that Mr. Trump has “never apologized for anything he’s done or said.”

But asked by The Washington Post about a tweet in which he deployed an expletive used by Mr. Trump to describe Haiti, Mr. Walsh said that while his word choice was perhaps “a little too provocative,” he stood by his description.

Amid his media blitz, Mr. Walsh received bad news about his own radio broadcast. In a statement Monday, Salem Radio Network announced that it would exercise its right to cancel national distribution of Mr. Walsh’s radio program, effective in 30 days.

A company official said any broadcaster who becomes a bona fide candidate for office must leave the air or risk exposing stations to the Federal Communications Commission’s equal time provision, under which any other declared candidate could demand airtime equal to that afforded to Mr. Walsh.

Jason Chaffetz said on Tuesday that the Department of Justice is “horrific” when it has to hold itself accountable, as prosecutors mull whether to pursue charges against former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe.

“Now they got a decision to make — are they going to hold the Department of Justice people accountable to the same degree that they do the rest of the world? And so far they’ve shown no backbone to be able to do so,” Chaffetz told “America's Newsroom.”

A source close to the process said that McCabe has had a “target on his back” because of the Justice Department inspector general findings against him over actions during the Hillary Clinton email investigation, as well as his role in the surveillance warrants against President Trump's campaign associates during the Russia investigation. McCabe is a former deputy and acting director of the FBI.

EX-FBI DEPUTY DIRECTOR ANDREW MCCABE SUES DOJ OVER DISMISSAL

Then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions fired McCabe in March 2018 after the Justice Department inspector general report found he had repeatedly misstated his involvement in a leak to The Wall Street Journal regarding an FBI investigation into the Clinton Foundation.

“Ultimately he was fired for cause, multiple occasions, [for] lying ... some of the times under oath,” Chaffetz said.

The New York Times, which first reported the developments Monday, said McCabe’s lawyers recently met with DOJ attorneys who would handle a prosecution — an indication of a possible indictment.

McCabe's legal team and the Justice Department declined to comment. The U.S. Attorney's Office in D.C. has not responded to a Fox News request for comment.

“The deputy assistant director was recommended for criminal prosecution by the inspector general and the DOJ said ‘we’re not going to prosecute. They’re not going to prosecute or go after Mr. Comey,” Chaffetz said.

He went on to say, “And for somebody who is so senior within the Department of Justice, they know better and it wasn’t one mistake. This happened on multiple occasions. That’s why he [McCabe] was fired and there are a lot of us that believe he should be prosecuted.”

McCabe was recently hired as a paid contributor by CNN.

Comey friend expects criminal charges against McCabe 'any day' now,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],08-27-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/comey-friend-expects-criminal-charges-against-mccabe-any-day-now,"A ""good friend"" of former FBI Director James Comey says he expects criminal charges against former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe any day now.

Benjamin Wittes, editor-in-chief of Lawfare, wrote in a blog post that he was shocked by a New York Times report Monday that revealed McCabe's lawyers met with top Justice Department officials in recent weeks.

""Such meetings generally take place when indictment is imminent; they happen when the government plans to bring charges,"" Wittes said on Tuesday. ""You should thus expect charges against McCabe to be forthcoming any day. And if such charges don’t happen, that doesn’t mean they weren’t planned but, rather, that some extrinsic event has intervened.""

McCabe’s lawyers met with Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen, who will help make the call on whether to prosecute, and U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Jessie Liu in two separate meetings last week. This indicates federal prosecutors are close to making a final decision on whether to indict McCabe, who is accused of lying to federal agents.

Wittes, an author and senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution, said the report was ""shocking."" He argued that ""as best as I can tell, the facts available on the public record simply don’t support such charges."" Wittes also suggested the White House may be a factor because of a ""sustained campaign by President Trump demanding McCabe’s scalp."" Trump has repeatedly criticized McCabe, who authorized the investigation into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia.

Former Attorney General Jeff Sessions fired McCabe in March 2018, less than two days before he was set to retire, prompted by a DOJ inspector general report that found he misled Comey and investigators about leaks to the media regarding the Hillary Clinton emails investigation and an inquiry into the Clinton Foundation which had not yet been made public.

Comey, whom Trump fired in May 2017, says he did not give McCabe permission to leak that information to the media. Comey has yet to comment on the latest developments in the McCabe investigation.

McCabe's lawyers have called the inspector general's report ""deeply flawed,"" and McCabe, who was hired by CNN last week, sued the Justice Department in August, accusing Trump of forcing his subordinates to participate in an “unconstitutional plan and scheme” to have him fired. He is demanding back pay, his full pension, and for his record to be expunged.

Wittes said if prosecutors bring criminal charges against McCabe, which he views as excessive, they will have to overcome ""substantially mitigating factors,"" such as McCabe correcting the record after he misled investigators and former FBI lawyer Lisa Page telling a grand jury that McCabe was authorized in his position as deputy director to give information to the media and had no motive to lie.

Wittes admitted there could be ""evidence that is not public yet"" against McCabe. He also predicted that McCabe's defense will be that he was confused and under a lot of pressure, given the circumstances at the time.

Although Wittes said he will not rush to judgment, he expressed concern about assistant U.S. attorneys dropping off the case. He also said, ""I would be lying if I said that, as I look at it now, it all seems on the level to me. I worry that what’s happening here is simple corruption of the Department of Justice in precisely the fashion I have been worrying about since before Donald Trump was even elected."""
Opinion | My Final Break With the Trump State Department,https://www.nytimes.com,['Bethany Milton'],08-26-2019,2019,8,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/26/opinion/trump-state-department.html,"When President Trump allowed a crowd to chant “Send her back!” about a sitting member of Congress — espousing an ideology in which naturalized American citizens, at least those who don’t fit a certain profile, are held to different and dangerous standards — he wasn’t thinking about me. He’s rarely thinking about me, the white American-born daughter of two American-born citizens.

But he is often thinking and talking about at least some of the tens of thousands of people I’ve helped immigrate to the United States — legally and permissibly — over my 11 years as a consular officer in the Foreign Service. From 2014 to 2016, I oversaw immigrant visa processing at the U.S. Consulate General in Mumbai, India. Every day, my team and I saw dozens of families destined to move to the United States as green card holders: older parents going to spend their final years surrounded by grandchildren, spouses matched up through online matrimonial sites, parents with kids in tow who had been waiting patiently since the early 1990s for their chance to join a sibling.

I also oversaw immigrant visa operations in Kigali, Rwanda, from 2018 to 2019, helping Rwandans and Congolese reunite with family members in the United States. Their stories often had a darker tone: marriages brokered in refugee camps, siblings separated by war, children born of rape. But the one thing that united almost every visa applicant I ever saw was the belief that life was going to be better in America. What a rude surprise, then, for them to face elected national leadership that targets them in such gruesome ways.

When a diplomat joins the State Department, she sits through two presentations toward the end of her weekslong orientation class. One is an afternoon session about the State Department’s storied dissent channel, which lets employees speak out internally about foreign policy decisions free from the fear of retaliation.

The other is a much shorter presentation, one that lasts all of 15 seconds: “The day you can no longer publicly support your administration’s policies is the day you need to resign.”"

Attorney general to host annual holiday party at Trump's D.C. hotel,https://www.cbsnews.com,[],,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/attorney-general-william-barr-to-host-annual-holiday-party-at-trump-international-hotel-in-washington-d-c/,"Attorney General William Barr is hosting his annual holiday party at the Trump International Hotel in Washington, the Justice Department confirmed Tuesday.

The Washington Post first reported Barr's party plans and said the private event will cost him roughly $30,000 for 200 guests. The party, which the department said Barr holds every year, is a ""ceilidh,"" a traditional Irish or Scottish party.

The Justice Department said Barr is not receiving a discount, and insisted there were no ethical or legal issues that would prevent him from holding his party at the hotel. President Trump still derives income from the property, and earned $40.8 million from the hotel in 2018, according to his financial disclosure report.

Barr's net worth is estimated at roughly $40 million, according to Forbes.

Barr, who has served as attorney general since earlier this year, became known for his defense of the president upon the release of former special counsel Robert Mueller's report, when he said evidence of potential obstruction of justice was insufficient to warrant charges. Barr has firmly defended his handling of the report.

Mr. Trump continues to face criticism for the use of his private properties during his presidency, particularly since he never divested his business interests when he took office. Most recently, Mr. Trump has proposed holding the next G-7 summit at his Miami golf club, concerning outside ethics experts.

August 20, 2019. Kevin Lamarque | Reuters

Fears about a flagging economy have jumped to the top of President Donald Trump's mind. As unusual bond market moves have prompted concerns about looming economic trouble, the president said ""we are very far from a recession."" Trump has pointed to a ""strong"" U.S. economy — the strongest in the world, he says — held back from soaring growth only by what he calls a ""clueless"" Federal Reserve and a news media hellbent on feeding the narrative of a downturn. At the G-7 meetings in France this weekend, he proclaimed the U.S. economy is ""the talk of the world!"" Trump has reason to fret. He has built his argument for reelection on American prosperity. His hopes for winning the race may hinge in no small part on stopping the U.S. from tumbling into a recession before November 2020.

Only two presidents since World War II — Democrats Harry Truman and Jimmy Carter — have run for reelection in the same year as a recession. While Truman won and Carter lost, history suggests an economic slump would damage Trump's chances in what will already be a tough 2020 race. Incumbents have a harder time winning amid a down economy because they need to find other issues to draw voters, said Lynn Vavreck, an American politics and public policy professor at UCLA. Trump is ""better positioned than most"" to withstand a slowdown because he ran on identity-focused issues like immigration in 2016, ""but without a good economy it will be harder for him to swing marginal voters,"" she said. Metrics such as the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index help track consumers views' on and expectations for the economy. The metric typically plummets during recessions. Over the survey's history back to the mid-20th century, it has ""largely"" found that ""if the index is low, the incumbent doesn't get reelected,"" said Richard Curtin, director of surveys of consumers at the University of Michigan. Recession fears climbed this month for a variety of reasons. Trade tensions with China exploded Friday: Trump said U.S. companies are ""hereby ordered"" to find an alternative to operating in the country, and the Trump administration hiked tariff rates on Chinese goods. A day earlier, a key indicator found the manufacturing sector contracted for the first time in 10 years, adding to concerns about the economy. Meanwhile, corporate profit growth has proven sluggish — though not as bad as some had feared. Trump may not need to worry just yet. Though some early warning signs of a slowdown have emerged, history suggests it could take until after the election in 2021 for a recession to hit. U.S. gross domestic product rose a solid 2.1% in the second quarter. On Wednesday, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projected long-term growth of 1.8%, even though it expects Trump's trade conflicts to drag on economic growth. While 1.8% growth is lower than the long-term U.S. historical average, it would comfortably keep the U.S. ahead of a recession. Uncertainty created by the Trump administration's trade war with China helped to send consumer sentiment lower in August to a level not seen since the beginning of the year, but it still sits well above levels typically seen during recessions. The current sentiment reading would suggest a good case for reelection for an incumbent president, Curtin said.

He notes that Trump's presidency has thrown out some traditional expectations for how voters will react to a president's first term. For instance, views on the economy have become more partisan: Democrats are less likely to have positive feelings about the economy while Trump is in office than they were when Republican President Ronald Reagan was in the White House. Despite the economy's solid standing now, parts of Wall Street see a rising risk of a recession in the next year. Since the possibility has vexed Trump, CNBC looked back at how other presidents fared while running for reelection under the shadow of a recession.

Truman triumphs, Carter falters

U.S. presidents have rarely run for reelection during a full blown recession since the mid-20th century. Truman was the first president after World War II to run for a second term during a recession. He did not actually win a first election — he started 1945 as President Franklin Roosevelt's vice president before taking over when the president died only three months into his fourth term.

History best remembers Truman's 1948 victory for the photo of him gleefully holding up a Chicago Daily Tribune newspaper with the headline ""DEWEY DEFEATS TRUMAN"" — a projection based on the conventional wisdom that Republican New York Gov. Thomas Dewey would beat him. The result is also significant because he won easily despite a recession. The downturn's timing may explain Truman's success. It did not hit until November 1948, the month of the election, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research. Not only did Truman comfortably win another term in the White House, but also his Democratic Party flipped control of both chambers of Congress. It gained 75 House seats and nine Senate seats. Carter did not have the same luck. The brief recession during his reelection year of 1980 started in January and ended in July — four months before Americans cast their ballots, according to NBER. It followed the 1979 energy crisis, when oil prices spiked and panic about the availability of gasoline spread in the U.S. Carter had encouraged Americans to live more modestly, a push Reagan targeted during his campaign. Republican Reagan trounced Carter, who won only six states. At the same time, the GOP gained more than 30 House seats and a dozen Senate seats. A few factors could explain why an election-year recession appeared to hurt Carter and not Truman. Due to how the government reports economic data, it can take months after a recession starts to confirm it. Voters also may not feel the effects of job losses or lower wages — or a recovery on the other end — until later. In Truman's case, Americans may not have known the recession started when they cast their ballots. When Carter stood for a second term, they may have had no idea that it ended.

I think John's point is right. Abdication is a word I have used. Essentially the United States has gone from being the principal architect and general contractor of world order to now becoming the principal disruptor. The problem for the Europeans and the Japanese and others is they lack the capacity to subjects duty substitute for us. They do what they can. $20 million for Amazon fires which is a literal drop in the bucket. Without the United States in the driver's seat, we don't make a lot of progress. The gap between the challenges and the international responses is growing. That's the historical judgment about the G-7, which looks like a tired gathering.



I think the two immediate things I would highlight are the president walked back two big issues. The trade war, for the moment, with China and the threat of actual war with Iran. On both of those, I think there was a change from where he showed up in France and where he ended."

Opinion writer

President Trump may not be a Russian agent per se, but it’s difficult to see how Russia could be any more pleased with a U.S. president who does the Kremlin’s bidding and refuses to stand up for U.S. interests.

At the Group of Seven meeting, which closed on Monday, Trump was even more eager to carry Russian President Vladimir Putin’s water behind closed doors. CNN reports: “As the leaders discussed issues like Iran and fires in the Amazon rainforest, Trump interjected and asked why Russia should not be included in the talks, given its size and role in global affairs. That met sharp resistance from some of the leaders, principally German Chancellor Angela Merkel and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson.” Not surprisingly, they argued that Russia got kicked out of the Group of Eight for invading Ukraine. “The dispute amounted to one of the most heated moments of this weekend’s G7,” CNN reports.

Trump’s crackpot theory that President Barack Obama being “outsmarted” was the precipitating factor of the Russian invasion in 2014 was rejected by the G-7′s reality-based members. (“The summit’s host, French President Emmanuel Macron, conceded it was important to maintain ties with Putin. But he didn’t go as far as the US leader, who grew more combative in his stance as the dinner wore on,” CNN reported.)

Why would an American president press so strongly on behalf of an adversary of the United States, and to the detriment of our relations with allies? Everyone has a theory but, whatever the cause, we have a president who repeatedly puts other countries first.

Trump took the extraordinary step of prevailing on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to exclude two U.S. congresswomen, Reps. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) and Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) from Israel. In effect, he opened the door to other countries excluding U.S. lawmakers who don’t meet with the foreign government’s approval.

Sure enough, we learned this week that the Kremlin has denied visas to Sens. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) and Chris Murphy (D-Conn.). Ironically,, during a previous Johnson was criticized back home for sounding too conciliatory. Now, he’s discovered his inner hawk. The Post reports:

Johnson’s office noted Monday that Johnson supported several pieces of legislation aiming “to hold Russia accountable for its aggression in Ukraine and its targeting of dissidents.” Among those measures was a bill that would have renamed the street outside of the Russian Embassy after slain Russian opposition leader Boris Nemtsov. In his statement, Johnson chided Russian President Vladi­mir Putin for having chosen a path for Russia that is “a tragedy of historic proportions.” He listed a number of criticisms, but notably did not mention Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election — an issue on which President Trump has been hesitant to criticize Putin.

Murphy has been a consistent Putin critic on everything from human rights to election interference. In a written statement, he declared, “With the collapse of recent arms control agreements and significant domestic opposition to Vladimir Putin’s authoritarian rule, this is potentially a perilous moment for our two nations’ fragile relationship, and it’s a shame that Russia isn’t interested in dialogue.”

So to recap: You have Trump imploring one ally to exclude American lawmakers and raising a fuss with other allies to invite Putin back into the G-7 while Russia still occupies portions of Ukraine; however, Putin feels no need to allow American lawmakers into his country. Of course he doesn’t; Trump is his patsy (for whatever reason) and, therefore, can insult America with impunity.

Congress needs to take back the reins in foreign policy, conditioning Russian visits on its willingness to allow in U.S. lawmakers. At the same time, Congress should rebuke Trump for impairing its work to conduct oversight and for doing Putin’s bidding on the G-7. They might even call up Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to ask why Trump keeps putting U.S. and Western interests last.

As for the presidential candidates, it might be a good idea to start calling out Trump as a weakling for dictators. The Democrats should be able to recapture the national security issue with minimal effort.

Oregon woman with California birth certificate sues State Department for denying her a U.S. passport,https://www.oregonlive.com,"['Maxine Bernstein', 'Mbernstein Oregonian.Com', 'The Oregonian Oregonlive']",08-28-2019,2019,8,https://www.oregonlive.com/crime/2019/08/oregon-woman-with-california-birth-certificate-sues-state-department-for-denying-her-a-us-passport.html,"An Oregon woman is suing the U.S. State Department for twice declining to issue her a U.S. passport even though her lawyer says she presented federal government officials with a certified birth certificate from a Los Angeles County hospital.

The American Civil Liberties Union of Oregon filed the suit Tuesday in federal court in Medford on behalf of Maria Qarrillo Soto, 48, who has lived in Oregon for 30 years. The lawsuit follows a similar complaint the ACLU filed in federal court in Colorado earlier this month on behalf of a Texas-born resident who also was denied a U.S. passport.

Soto, a married mother of two grown daughters who lives in White City, was denied a U.S. passport in 2018 despite providing government officials with the original birth certificate and copies of her Social Security card, driver’s license and marriage certificate and medical records from her pregnancy, according to her attorney, Leland Baxter-Neal of the ACLU.

The government denied the passport, writing to her that the material she presented was “not sufficient to establish your identity,’’ according to a letter from the U.S. Department of State.

Someone applying for a U.S. passport must establish their identity through submission of a previous passport, or other state, local or federal government-issued photo identification, the letter said.

Soto had been denied a U.S. passport in 1994 after she applied for one the prior year.

“There’s no reasonable explanation for denying her passport,’’ Baxter-Neal said Tuesday.

The State Department said it doesn’t comment on pending lawsuits.

Soto was born in Los Angeles County Hospital in April 1971 to her migrant parents from Mexico, father Felix Carrillo Arrellano and mother Guadalupe Barjaas Macias, according to the suit. At the time of her birth, her last name was misspelled on her birth certificate as “Qarrillo,’’ not Carillo.

She used “Qarrillo” until she married and took her husband’s name, using “Qarrillo’’ on her Social Security card, driver’s license and other identification, her lawyer said.

“The misspelling of her name is like a quirk in the case but everything she submitted proves her identity,’’ Baxter-Neal said.

Her parents, who are now deceased, worked in agriculture in Los Angeles and returned their daughter to Mexico to be raised by her maternal grandparents when she was between 1 month and 3 months old. During her childhood, Soto returned to the United States about once a year between ages 8 and 17, crossing the border by presenting her birth certificate, according to the suit.

Soto returned to live in the United States in 1989 at age 18, settling in Klamath Falls, Oregon. That year, she married Jose Alfredo Soto Toriz. In 1990, she petitioned for an immigrant visa for her husband as the spouse of a U.S. citizen, presenting proof to the government of her citizenship. The petition was approved and her husband was granted residency in 1995, according to her attorney.

When Soto applied for a U.S. passport in 1993, she submitted a photocopy of a certified copy of her birth certificate from Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center. The State Department sent her a letter on June 3, 1994, requesting additional documentation about her birth, her family and upbringing and her application was denied when Soto didn’t provide additional records to the government, the suit says.

At that time, Soto didn’t send her original birth certificate in, fearful she wouldn’t get it back, her lawyer said.

She applied a second time for a U.S. passport in February 2018, submitting a certified copy of her birth certificate, a copy of her Social Security card and her driver’s license. Because of the State Department’s earlier denial, it informed her that she needed to fill out an additional form – a “Supplemental Questionnaire to Determine Identity’’ – for the passport.

So she sent the completed form and additional documentation – her original birth certificate, her marriage certificate, a letter confirming her education in Mexico, medical records related to her pregnancy and a letter from her church, where she provides Bible study classes, according to Baxter-Neal.

But the government found that still wasn’t enough and denied her request on July 2, 2018, according to the suit.

Soto had hoped to travel to Peru with her husband.

“We’re suing to make sure she’s able to travel in the future like every other U.S. citizen,’’ Baxter-Neal said.

The ACLU argues that President Donald Trump’s administration is blocking U.S. passports more frequently for Latin Americans. The group pointed to a report by The Washington Post last summer about a surge in passport denials for Latin Americans born along the United States’ southern border.

“The idea that all people should be treated fairly and equally is fundamental to our democracy, and we must fight against the Trump administration’s attempts to divide us based on skin color or accents,’’ Baxter-Neal said in a statement.

Looking at data from recent months, we can even identify a trend similar to that of early 2017.

Still, the question remains – where did the money that catalyzed Bitcoin’s surge in 2019 come from? Rumors and internet conspiracies circulate, suggesting that inside information leaked from Facebook about the launch of its Libra cryptocurrency and created a trend change before the announcement and the associated hype.

When it comes to altcoins, the downtrend seems to have been halted this week as Binance announced the launch of a digital currency lending system, with its first two products being BNB and USDT. Surprisingly, users will be able to lend ETC, which explains its price increase. Wanchain also stood out this week, gaining more than 100% and occupying the 88th spot on the list of the top 100 cryptocurrencies.

Nevertheless, Bitcoin has maintained its dominance, and it’s still too early to talk about a change in the trend with respect to the altcoin markets, as Bitcoin hasn’t yet completed its move which began at the beginning of the year.

The trading volume is declining, and investors fear this trend will continue. Of course, there may also be those who are already plotting another move behind the scenes. Events such as Telegram’s coin launch, a recession, or the Bitcoin halving could certainly send Bitcoin’s price to new heights. The future won’t be boring, that’s for sure.

Meanwhile, the Kleiman v. Wright case is also seemingly coming to an end, as a judge ruled against Wright, who might have to pay 500,000 BTC to the brother of an old business partner. The sum is currently worth upwards of $5 billion, and almost half of that might need to be used to pay taxes, which could impact Bitcoin’s price in the short term.

Bitcoin Should Be Regulated Like Other Electronic Financial Services: US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. The US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, said that Bitcoin should be regulated like any other electronic financial service in existence today. His main concerns are related to the anonymity of transactions carried out on Bitcoin’s network.

Tether Plans to Issue CNHT, a CNY-Pegged Stablecoin. The issuer of the most popular stablecoin on the market, Tether, is reportedly working on a new stablecoin called CNHT. It will be pegged to the official fiat currency of China, the yuan. The news was confirmed by Dong Zhao, a shareholder of Bitfinex.

Altcoins Comprise Only 10% of the Crypto Market, Not 30%. According to a new study, the relative share of all altcoins in the overall cryptocurrency market isn’t 30%, but merely 10%. This suggests that Bitcoin’s dominance rate is close to 90%. The research factored in liquidity, maintaining that the latter is key in generating accurate market cap numbers.

Lisa Page could save Andrew McCabe from DOJ criminal charges,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],08-26-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/lisa-page-could-save-andrew-mccabe-from-doj-criminal-charges,"Former FBI lawyer Lisa Page could hinder a criminal case against former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe if the Justice Department decides to bring charges against him.

Federal prosecutors are close to making a final decision on whether to indict McCabe, who is accused of lying to federal agents, the New York Times reported Monday.

McCabe’s lawyers met with Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen, who will help make the call on whether to prosecute, and U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia Jessie Liu in two separate meetings last week. This signals McCabe’s lawyers could be making a last-ditch effort to convince the top law enforcement officials not to prosecute the case.

If they were to bring charges against McCabe, prosecutors would have to prove he knowingly and intentionally lied to investigators when he told them on two occasions that he did not remember authorizing Page to speak to a Wall Street Journal reporter. McCabe corrected himself at a later time.

Page, who worked as a special counsel to McCabe, told a grand jury in Washington, D.C., that McCabe was authorized in his position as deputy director to give information to the media and had no motive to lie. Page resigned from the bureau last year after it was discovered she had exchanged anti-Trump text messages with former FBI agent Peter Strzok, with whom she had an affair.

Former Attorney General Jeff Sessions fired McCabe in March 2018, less than two days before he was set to retire. This followed Michael Horowitz, DOJ’s inspector general, releasing a report in February 2018 detailing instances where McCabe “lacked candor” with then-FBI Director James Comey and investigators and concluded McCabe greenlit disclosures to the media of sensitive information on an FBI investigation into the Clinton Foundation “to make himself look good.”

McCabe's lawyers called the inspector general's report ""deeply flawed.""

Comey has said he did not give McCabe permission to leak, and when Sessions fired McCabe he stated the deputy director “made an unauthorized disclosure to the news media and lacked candor — including under oath — on multiple occasions.”

McCabe, who was hired by CNN last week, sued in August, accusing Trump of forcing his subordinates at the Justice Department to participate in an “unconstitutional plan and scheme” to have him fired, and is demanding back pay, his full pension, and for his record to be expunged. Trump has accused McCabe, who authorized the investigation into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia, of being involved in an ""illegal and treasonous"" plot against him.

Neither DOJ nor McCabe’s attorney immediately responded to the Washington Examiner’s requests for comment.

The investigation into McCabe has been lengthy — so long, in fact, the Times reported the term expired for grand jury hearing evidence. It began last year after Horowitz referred his findings to the U.S. attorney’s office in Washington for possible criminal charges. Frustrated with the prolonged process, DOJ prosecutor Kamil Shields left the case and joined a private practice. Another assistant U.S. attorney, David Kent, is also no longer on the case.

McCabe is also likely still being scrutinized in Horowitz’s inquiry into allegations of abuse of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. The surveillance warrant applications targeting Trump associate Carter Page required the approval of top members of the FBI and DOJ, and McCabe was involved in the FISA approval process.

Horowitz’s report is expected to be released to the public in late September or early October."
Brighton water treatment plant out of compliance with EPA standards for 3 consecutive years,https://www.thedenverchannel.com,[],08-27-2019,2019,8,https://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/local-news/brighton-in-violation-of-epa-drinking-water-standards-for-3-consecutive-years-according-to-report,"BRIGHTON, Colo. -- We knew the water in Brighton was expensive, now - it turns out - it could be dangerous, too.

The same city that could see its mayor recalled over sky-high water bills now admits it was out of compliance with EPA water treatment standards for 3 years.

The water scandal continues to mystify even some who sit on the current council.

""The residents don't trust the city,"" said councilman Matt Johnston. ""I, as a city council representative, do not trust our city.""

The latest issue to surface is an EPA summary which concludes Brighton had ""Significant/Category 1"" violations for 12 consecutive quarters.

A city spokeswoman said late Monday those violations are for treated discharge that goes back into the river, not the drinking water.

But, Brighton's former city manager said late Monday that the reverse osmosis treatment facility also supplies Brighton with drinking water, so any violation at the plant should be concerning.

""Someone's at serious risk if the plant is that out of compliance,"" said former city manager Philip Rodriguez, who was fired in the midst of this scandal back in July. ""Either Brighton or its neighbors downstream.""

The city told Denver7 on Tuesday those issues were resolved and the treatment facility is now in compliance.

""We cannot say that 100% for sure all of our water is safe,"" Johnston said. ""We can't say that.""

And, in fact, just last week the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment required Brighton to send a letter to residents warning them about a dangerous back flow issue that could impact the drinking water supply.

For homeowner's like Jeremy Torgerson, it's mind-boggling.

""You don't want to cook with it, give it to your kids, your dog or anything,"" Torgerson said. ""I don't know how many more punches the residents have to take from their own city before we finally decide that we've had enough.""

The ongoing scandal has resulted in a flood of problems at city hall including the discovery of a $70 million fund from possible water billing overcharges and the subsequent firing of the city manager.

And now – there will be a recall election of the current mayor who insists the water is safe.

""The water here in Brighton is safe,"" said Mayor Ken Kreutzer. ""I drink it. My children drink it. My grandson drinks it. This is another gross exaggeration.""

But Johnston and others, like Torgerson, are no longer going with the flow. They insist city hall is corrupt.

""I'm tired of the backroom,"" Johnston said. ""It's time for the public to know everything about our water system - if it's safe, if it's clean, where the money's at and what it's being spent for.""

And while the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment hasn't issued a boil order, Johnston believes it's only a matter of time.

""This is a pre-boil warning type of scenario,"" Johnston said.

""The city government no longer functions,"" Torgerson said. ""This a basic function of a utility department to make sure the water that goes out is safe. They overcharge, and now we have to drink bottled water.""

Johnston says those who are sick should be particularly cautious.

""They're going through chemotherapy, and they do not know if they should be boiling their water at this point,"" Johnston said."
Trump still hasn't realized that being president restricts what you should say and do,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],08-27-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/trump-still-hasnt-realized-that-being-president-restricts-what-you-should-say-or-do,"As the Washington Examiner argues in an editorial, it would be unethical and ill-advised to host next year's G-7 Summit at President Trump's Doral resort. But the fact that Trump has been making the pitch not only signals a willingness to personally enrich himself through the office of the presidency, but also gets at a much deeper problem.

Since taking office, Trump has never been able to grasp that being president, in addition to coming with new powers, also comes with certain restrictions about what he should say or do. There are statements and actions that may be acceptable or even innocuous outside the context of being commander in chief that become wildly inappropriate when done by a president. This has been a central problem in many of the controversies that have consumed his presidency.

His business actions and aggressive pitches of his properties can create conflicts of interest. His rant about ""disloyal Jews"" has much more weight coming as a president with an influential following. His regular Twitter tantrums aren't the same as when he was a private citizen; they can move markets and uproot our nation's foreign policy.

Regardless of whether one believes the actions outlined in Robert Mueller's report amount to obstruction of justice, it's clear that he would have had significantly less to work with had Trump recognized that as president, his words have more serious ramifications. His chat with James Comey about ""loyalty"" and his tweets about witnesses, among other actions, were clearly improper even if one doesn't believe they were illegal.

As he enters the 2020 election, his biggest vulnerability may be his utter inability to grasp the gravity of the office — specifically, the ways in which it limits what you can say or do."
VA secretary rejects Obama religious expression rules: 'They did not know the makeup of the force',https://www.washingtontimes.com,"['The Washington Times Http', 'Christopher Vondracek']",08-27-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/aug/27/robert-wilkie-va-secretary-rejects-obama-religious/,"Robert Wilkie, the soft-spoken and managerial-minded secretary of Veterans Affairs, went public in a big way this summer when he said he refused to be “bullied” by a federal lawsuit claiming a Bible on display at a New Hampshire VA hospital violated the separation of church and state.

In an interview with The Washington Times in his office at the Department of Veterans Affairs, Mr. Wilkie said displaying a Bible in a VA hospital is a matter of liberty and that the Obama administration erred in trying to eliminate religious symbols from the veterans health care system.

“The last administration … had a very ahistoric approach [to veterans],” Mr. Wilkie said. “They did not know the makeup of the force. They did not know the history of this country when it came to religious foundations, the religious support for those in uniform.”

He said he grew up in a military family in North Carolina and believes the vast majority of veterans “identify themselves religiously.”

Meanwhile, a federal judge in New Hampshire will soon decide whether a Bible in a bolted-down display case in the lobby of a Manchester hospital funded by taxpayer dollars represents constitutionally protected speech.

A group of veterans, with support from the Military Religious Freedom Foundation, filed a lawsuit in May to remove the Bible.

“The placement of the Christian Bible, here, is in violation of that fundamental proscription, that the government may not establish any religion,” the lawsuit states.

Mr. Wilkie, noting the department’s murky directives on religious memorabilia, said he empathized with VA administrators who initially removed the Bible decorating the POW/MIA memorial table before replacing the book. The Bible was donated by a World War II veteran who had survived a German prisoner of war camp.

“I think the leadership of the VA hospital was still not sure how to act given the directives of the last administration,” Mr. Wilkie said.

The VA secretary accused the Obama administration of banning the Army Chaplain Corps — which currently numbers 800, including student chaplains — from distributing religious materials, including Bibles, Torahs and Korans, to veterans, even those who request them.

The previous administration, he said, even forbade revelers from singing Christmas carols in VA hospitals.

“The underlying notion here is that there is a group of people who want to eliminate all indicia of religion and spirituality from the public square,” Mr. Wilkie said. “And they’ve used the military as their hobby horse, and that, to me, is a great disservice to the vast majority of those who served.”

Michael L. Weinstein, a lawyer and founder of the Military Religious Freedom Foundation, said his organization is looking forward to its day in court.

“I find it very ironic that VA Secretary Wilkie believes that upholding the separation of church and state regarding religious displays in VA facilities represents the interest of only a narrow number of people,” Mr. Weinstein said via email. “The Veterans Administration is what is called a ‘state actor’ and therefore must completely comply with the No Establishment Clause of the First Amendment of the Bill of Rights of our U.S. Constitution.”

The VA has a number of policies on religious expression. A 2016 inspector general’s report found no evidence that those policies contributed to religious insensitivity, and Secretary David J. Shulkin at the time wrote that policies “generally aligned” with applicable federal laws.

However, the inspector general’s report noted that the VA had not adequately updated a variety of policies related to religious expression, including directive 0022 on religious symbols. In one instance, the inspector general found that a VA guidance on maintenance at national cemeteries hadn’t been updated in 22 years.

According to multiple press reports at the time, the Obama administration adopted rules meant to curtail reported instances of proselytizing at military bases and hospitals. Mr. Wilkie’s staff said those strictures will stay in place.

“I also want to make clear that a lot of people will try to say that [the VA’s memo on Bibles and public display] constitutes proselytization,” said John Mashburn, a senior adviser to Mr. Wilkie. “[But] the VA kept in places its prohibition against proselytization.”

Mr. Wilkie had served as a legal aide to various Republican members of Congress, including Jesse Helms and Trent Lott, before his March 2018 promotion from an undersecretary post in the Department of Defense to head of the Department of Veterans Affairs. He was named acting VA secretary before the nomination of presidential physician Ronny Jackson was scuttled by reports that Dr. Jackson created an abusive work environment and drank on the job.

The secretary said the spirituality of veterans is inseparable from the task of healing, especially during a crisis of depression, addiction and suicide.

“What I consider to be the bizarre argument that men and women who’ve been sent to the most dangerous corners of the Earth, the most miserable places on the planet, would walk by a Bible on a table dedicated to missing men and go to pieces by the sight of that Bible when so many of them have been under fire in Iraq, Afghanistan, Somalia, Liberia, [just] goes counter to all logic,” Mr. Wilkie said.

The VA secretary noted that the Army Chaplain Regimental Corps crest reads “Pro Deo et Patria.” He said any decision to remove the Bible in New Hampshire would diminish that motto.

“For veterans, we’re not going to deprive them of that [spiritual] comfort during what is often a very, very trying time,” he said.

Weill Family Foundation announces public-private partnership with Energy Department on artificial intelligence,https://www.cnbc.com,['Riya Bhattacharjee'],08-26-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/26/weill-foundation-announces-public-private-partnership-with-dept-of-energy-on-artificial-intelligence.html,"The Department of Energy and the Weill Family Foundation on Monday signed a memorandum of understanding for a new public-private partnership which will use the agency's artificial intelligence capabilities for biomedical research.

Former Citigroup CEO Sandy Weill and Energy Secretary Rick Perry told CNBC's ""Closing Bell "" in an exclusive interview that the partnership aims to improve the diagnosis of brain diseases and neurological disorders, which would result in more effective treatment.

""As one looks at science and the development of new science, especially AI and computing, you really need to have partners to make things work."" Weill said. ""It's too expensive for anybody to try to do it by themselves.""

The partnership between the federal government and the Weill Family Foundation, involves Lawrence Livermore, Lawrence Berkeley and Argonne National laboratories, and was announced during a roundtable on DOE-fueled artificial intelligence at Lawrence Livermore Lab in Livermore, California.

The Department of Energy is currently home to the fastest supercomputers in the world.

The partnership aims to have new computers ready by 2022 that would run 15 times faster than current speeds.

""It will really break the logjam, especially as it related to neurodegenerative diseases,"" Weill said. ""And with everybody doing better, with the cancer research and with cardiovascular research, people are going to live longer. And we are all going to get these neurodegenerative diseases over time. And what we are working on is to prevent that because it would just be too costly.""

Perry said in the next 18 to 24 months, the department will have computers coming on board that will be between 50 to 100 times faster than today's computers. ""The improvement in health care, particularly in brain science, is going to be monumental, it's going to be world changing,"" Perry said.

Weill added it was important for the U.S. to beat China in this field.

When asked about current U.S.-China trade relations, Weill said it was important for the United States and China to figure out a way to get along with each other. ""With the two countries partnering for the future, I think we will end up with a better world, a safer world."""
Trump's North Korea point man gets a look for No. 2 State Dept. job,https://www.politico.com,"['Daniel Lippman', 'Eliana Johnson']",08-26-2019,2019,8,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/08/26/biegun-north-korea-state-dept-1475896,"Special Envoy for North Korea Steve Biegun is being seriously considered to replace deputy secretary of state John Sullivan. | Jeon Heon-Kyun/Getty Images foreign policy Trump's North Korea point man gets a look for No. 2 State Dept. job Taking the deputy secretary position would leave the president without a dedicated envoy to Kim Jong Un.

Steve Biegun, President Trump’s special representative for North Korea, is being seriously considered for the No. 2 job at the State Department, according to two senior administration officials with knowledge of the matter.

The post looks like it’s going to open up soon because the current deputy secretary of state John Sullivan, who met with Trump in the Oval Office last week, is likely to get nominated in the coming weeks to be the U.S. ambassador to Russia, replacing Jon Huntsman, who leaves his post in early October.

Story Continued Below

While it’s early in the selection process for the job, multiple officials said that Biegun, a former auto executive who has been the point man on working-level negotiations with the North Korean regime, is a strong candidate.

Biegun, whose background before the North Korean job was in Russia policy, had also been considered to replace Huntsman and has talked to Trump about being an ambassador. He also reportedly turned down the Russia job.

“It’s good to have someone who is already in the system,” said a senior administration official. “They understand how the process goes. They already have a security clearance.” The White House didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

“The whole building is vying for the job,” according to another senior administration official. One of the contenders could include Brian Bulatao, the undersecretary of state for management, who was chief operating officer of the CIA when Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was CIA director, according to a former senior State Department official. Bulatao didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

It could take a while for Sullivan to get confirmed if and when he’s officially selected, since confirming judicial nominees is Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s priority, which leads to occasional delays for executive branch nominees. Russia also is likely to take at least two months to approve the U.S. picking Sullivan, a diplomatic protocol known as “agrément.”

Trump has resisted acknowledging that his talks with Kim Jong Un have made little headway, and has sought a third summit with the North Korean leader.

He told reporters at the G7 in France on Monday that Kim “is a man with a country that has tremendous potential.” He had said that he was “not happy” about North Korea’s recent missile tests, which his own national security adviser has said violate U.N. Security Council resolutions.

There has also been some rather public daylight between Biegun and Trump on the progress the U.S. has made in negotiating with North Korea. While Trump bragged last year that there wasn’t a nuclear threat from North Korea anymore, Biegun said earlier this year at Stanford that “it is fair to say we have more work ahead of us than behind us.”

With few signs of any coming breakthroughs with North Korea, Biegun has recently shown signs of wanting to leave his current job. He’s been telling associates he was eager to move on from the envoy post and felt it was a thankless job, according to three people familiar with his comments.

In his job as Trump’s North Korea envoy, Biegun has had difficulty getting meetings with top North Korean officials to advance U.S. goals of denuclearization.

“Not having the North Koreans meet with you and the North Koreans only want to meet with the president is pretty frustrating,” said one Republican foreign policy hand who knows Biegun. “And negotiating with the North Koreans is hopeless. They just want to meet at the presidential level so there’s no real meetings at his level.”

It’s not clear whether Biegun would actually take the deputy job if Trump offers it. He has also told people that he is tired of serving in government and is eager to return to the private sector.

The State Department, meanwhile, is fending off twin challenges: a president whose sudden pronouncements can rewrite policy in mere seconds; and a budget that is constantly under the threat of severe cuts under Trump.

“How are you supposed to come to work and to be a serious professional when you don’t know what’s coming tomorrow?” said another Republican involved in foreign policy in Washington. “Even Pompeo doesn’t know the crazy thing Trump is going to say the next day and it’s really hard to engage with people in the White House” who don’t know what Trump is going to do either.

Weighing against this chaos factor: If Biegun is picked for the deputy job, there’s a possibility he could eventually become the acting secretary of state should Pompeo leave to run for a Senate seat in his home state of Kansas.

Biegun served as executive secretary of the National Security Council in the Bush administration and also had a brief stint as foreign policy adviser to Sarah Palin when she was John McCain’s vice presidential nominee.

Before joining the Trump administration, he worked as the vice president of international governmental affairs at Ford. After H.R. McMaster left as Trump’s national security adviser, Biegun was considered for that job before John Bolton was picked.

Traditionally, the deputy secretary of state position is tasked with managing the State Department’s 69,000 employees, but also usually carves out select foreign policy portfolios of his or her own.

Sullivan, for instance, has focused on a few key issues, including implementing the sanctions against Russia, leading the administration’s diplomatic response to the gas attacks and barrel bombings in Syria, and guiding the Trump team’s efforts to stabilize South Sudan.

Trump told reporters last week that Sullivan “could very well be” picked as the ambassador to Russia and that Pompeo “likes him very much.”

As for Biegun’s suitability for the job, “It’s a really tough and challenging role but I think Steve would be really excellent at it, just because of his work ethic, his style, his intelligence,” another former senior State Department official said. “I’ve always found Steve to be fair.”

Biegun didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

His departure would leave the North Korea envoy role empty -- but Trump has shown few signs of leaning on Biegun in any event.

On Monday, the president said that his wife, First Lady Melania Trump, has also gotten to know Kim Jong Un. That left Stephanie Grisham, the White House press secretary, to quickly clarify Trump’s comments.

“President Trump confides in his wife on many issues including the detailed elements of his strong relationship with Chairman Kim,” she said in a statement. “And while the first lady hasn’t met him, the president feels like she’s gotten to know him too.”

Elizabeth Warren's balancing act is working,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],08-27-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/elizabeth-warrens-balancing-act-is-working,"Elizabeth Warren is walking a tightrope. One of the Democratic Party’s most liberal candidates, Warren is successfully fighting Bernie Sanders for the far Left’s vote. At the same time, she is trying to prove to the Democratic establishment that she has what it takes to beat Donald Trump.

Warren is a career Democrat and a political insider who sits just far enough to the Left on the ideological spectrum to be considered an outsider. Much of Warren’s campaign has been spent emphasizing this point. She wants to be the candidate who unites a party that faces a deep divide from within, and it’s working.

Warren will likely win the progressive vote. Compared to Sanders, whose platform is most similar to hers, Warren provides energy and a clear vision to match it. As Stuart Appelabum, a member of the Democratic National Committee, told The Atlantic, Sanders “is providing more of economic aspirations; she’s providing more of a road map.”

Recent polls confirm Warren’s rise. Last week, an Economist-YouGov poll found that Warren garnered 20% of primary voters’ support while Sanders came in third, clocking in at 16%. A more recent poll average by Real Clear Politics shows Warren surging to close front-runner Joe Biden’s lead in Iowa, taking 18% of the vote while Biden drops to 26%.

But Warren’s “insider-outsider routine,” as Edward-Isaac Dovere called it, could be the very thing that sinks her campaign. As she continues to cozy up to the Democratic establishment, many of the “change-hungry” Sanders voters could see this and turn against her. Lean too far to one side of the tightrope and Warren will face a steep drop.

“I hope Sanders supporters see Warren’s broadening support as a good thing and won’t now cynically try to paint her as beholden to insiders, because she’s not,” a DNC member told The Atlantic.

For now, Warren’s aggressive policies and tactical solutions are enough to appease both establishment insiders and far-left activists. But will they be enough?"
Department of Energy awards Fermilab $3.5 million for quantum science,https://news.fnal.gov,[],,,,https://news.fnal.gov/2019/08/department-of-energy-awards-fermilab-3-5-million-for-quantum-science/,"The U.S. Department of Energy has awarded researchers at its Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory more than $3.5 million to boost research in the fast-emerging field of Quantum Information Science.

“Few pursuits have the revolutionary potential that quantum science presents,” said Fermilab Chief Research Officer Joe Lykken. “Fermilab’s expertise in quantum physics and cryogenic engineering is world-class, and combined with our experience in conventional computing and networks, we can advance quantum science in directions that not many other places can.”

As part of a number of grants to national laboratories and universities offered through its Quantum Information Science-Enabled Discovery (QuantISED) program, DOE’s recent round of funding to Fermilab covers three initiatives related to quantum science. It also funds Fermilab’s participation in a fourth initiative led by Argonne National Laboratory.

For a half-century, Fermilab researchers have closely studied the quantum realm and provided the computational and engineering capabilties needed to zoom in on nature at its most fundamental level. The projects announced by the Department of Energy will build on those capabilities, pushing quantum science and technology forward and leading to new discoveries that will enhance our picture of the universe at its smallest scale.

“Fermilab is well-versed in engineering, algorithmic development and recruiting massive computational resources to explore quantum-scale phenomena,” said Fermilab Head of Quantum Science Panagiotis Spentzouris. “Now we’re wrangling those competencies and capabilities to advance quantum science in many areas, and in a way that only a leading physics laboratory could.”

The Fermilab-led initiatives funded through these DOE QuantISED grants are:

Large Scale Simulations of Quantum Systems on High-Performance Computing with Analytics for High-Energy Physics Algorithms

Lead principal investigator: Adam Lyon, Fermilab

The large-scale simulation of quantum computers has plenty in common with simulations in high-energy physics: Both must sweep over a large number of variables. Both organize their inputs and outputs similarly. And in both cases, the simulation has to be analyzed and consolidated into results. Fermilab scientists, in collaboration with scientists at Argonne National Laboratory, will use tools from high-energy physics to produce and analyze simulations using high-performance computers at the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility. Specifically, they will simulate the operation of a qubit device that uses superconducting cavities (which are also used as components in particle accelerators) to maintain quantum information over a relatively long time. Their results will determine the device’s impact on high-energy physics algorithms using an Argonne-developed quantum simulator.

Partner institution: Argonne National Laboratory

Research Technology for Quantum Information Systems

Lead principal investigator: Gustavo Cancelo, Fermilab

One of the main challenges in quantum information science is designing an architecture that solves problems of massive interconnection, massive data processing and heat load. The electronics must be able to operate and interface with other electronics operating both at 4 kelvins and at near absolute zero. Fermilab scientists and engineers are designing novel electronic circuits as well as massive control and readout electronics to be compatible with quantum devices, such as sensors and quantum qubits. These circuits will enable many applications in the quantum information science field.

Fermilab will host a new experiment to test quantum mechanics on macroscopic scales of space and time. Scientists on the MAGIS-100 experiment will drop clouds of ultracold atoms down a 100-meter-long vacuum pipe on the Fermilab site, and use a stable laser to create an atom interferometer which will look for dark matter made of ultralightweight particles. They will also advance a technique for gravitational-wave detection at relatively low frequencies.

This is a joint venture under the collaboration leadership of Stanford University Professor Jason Hogan, who is funded by grant GBMF7945 from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation. Rob Plunkett of Fermilab serves as the project manager.

Other participating institutions: Northern Illinois University, Northwestern University, Stanford University, Johns Hopkins University, University of Liverpool

Fermilab was also funded to participate in another initiative led by Argonne National Laboratory:

Quantum Sensors for Wide Band Axion Dark Matter Detection

Lead principal investigator: Peter Barry, Argonne

Researchers are searching high and low for dark matter, the mysterious substance that makes up a quarter of our universe. One theory proposes that it could be made of particles called axions, which would signal their presence by converting into particles of light, called photons. Fermilab researchers are part of a team developing specialized detectors that look for photons in the terahertz range — at frequencies just below the infrared. The development of these detectors will widen the range of frequencies where axions may be discovered. To bring the faint signals to the fore, the team is using supersensitive quantum amplifiers.

State Department says removal of 'Palestinian Territories' from website isn't policy change,https://www.cnn.com,"['Jennifer Hansler', 'Andrew Carey']",08-26-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/26/politics/state-department-website-palestinian-territories/index.html,"(CNN) The State Department on Monday denied that the removal of a listing for the Palestinian Territories from its website constituted a change in policy.

""Website is being updated. There has been no change to our policy,"" a State Department official said in a statement. Asked whether the listing would be added back to the website, the official reiterated that the site is being updated.

It is unclear when exactly the listing for the territories, which was once included as one of the ""countries and other areas"" under the Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs, was removed. It was active until at least February 2019, according to an archived version of the page. The State Department unveiled its modernized website in June 2019, and the link for the Palestinian Territories now redirects to a message about that modernization.

""Welcome to state.gov. We recently modernized our website. Part of this modernization was to reduce the number of pages on the current state.gov website by not moving items that are in existence on our archive sites. This keeps the content on the current state.gov current while older content remains intact and fully accessible on our archive sites,"" the message says.

The omission of the Palestinian Territories drew outrage from Palestinian officials.

Biden Widens Lead Over Democratic Field in New Poll,https://www.usnews.com,[],08-27-2019,2019,8,https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2019-08-27/biden-widens-lead-over-democratic-field-in-new-poll,"Former U.S. Vice President and current presidential candidate Joe Biden speaks to potential voters, Aug. 23, 2019, on the Dartmouth College campus in Hanover, N.H. during his campaign trail through New England. (Erin Clark/The Boston Globe/Getty Images)

Joe Biden has widened his lead over two progressive senators in a new poll released Tuesday, giving the former vice president much better news a day after another survey found his advantage slipping.

A new Morning Consult poll showed Biden with 33% support for the Democratic presidential nomination, extending his lead by 2 percentage points since the last poll conducted a week ago. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont came in second with 20%, followed by Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts with 15%. Both senators maintained their numbers since last week's poll.

The Morning Consult survey comes a day after Monmouth University's poll showed Biden losing ground and landing in a virtual three-way tie with Sanders and Warren. The senators each clinched 20%, followed by Biden with 19%. While it was a big drop for the former vice president, his campaign described Monmouth's survey as an ""outlier"" with a small sample size. Morning Consult uses a vastly larger sample size in its polling.

Among voters in early primary and caucus states polled by Morning Consult, Biden further extended his lead over Sanders to 16 points. Those polled include voters in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada, showing promising news for the former vice president in the first four states to cast ballots in the nominating contests.

Biden and Sanders have the highest favorability ratings among the Democratic field in Morning Consult's poll. Seventy-five percent of voters have a favorable opinion of Biden, while 18% have an unfavorable view. Sanders has a similar 75%-18% favorability rating.

Tuesday's poll trends with a majority of other polls that find Biden in the lead and a solidified top three that includes Sanders and Warren. All other candidates polled in the single digits, with Sen. Kamala Harris of California in fourth place with 8%.

Emerson College also released a new poll Tuesday that finds Biden with a 7-point lead over Sanders, 31%-24%. Warren garners 15% and Harris rounds out the top four with 10%. All other candidates polled at 4% or less.

Emerson's survey polled head-to-head matchups against President Donald Trump, finding that Biden and Sanders are the only two candidates to defeat him. The poll found Biden leading Trump, 54%-46%, and Sanders defeating Trump 52%-48%. Both Warren and Harris tie Trump, but the president narrowly defeats South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, 51%-49%.

Neither Morning Consult or Emerson's surveys are part of the Democratic National Committee's approved polls to qualify for the primary debates. Wednesday is the deadline to qualify for the September debate, and it appears increasingly likely that only 10 candidates make the stage.

The Morning Consult poll was conducted from Aug. 19 to 25 and surveyed 17,303 registered voters. The early primary state sample includes 745 voters from Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada. The margin of error was 1 percentage point."
Proposed 836 extension gets slammed by EPA: ‘unacceptable adverse secondary impacts’ to the Everglades,https://www.miamiherald.com,[],,,,https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/environment/article234428567.html,"Conflicts of the proposed Dolphin/836 Expressway extension with the Everglades restoration plan Celeste De Palma, Director of Everglades Policy of Audubon Florida, talks about conflicts of the proposed Dolphin/836 Expressway extension Up Next × SHARE COPY LINK Celeste De Palma, Director of Everglades Policy of Audubon Florida, talks about conflicts of the proposed Dolphin/836 Expressway extension

Federal environmental regulators have joined critics of Miami-Dade’s proposal to run a major freeway through wetlands, saying the plan to construct the Kendall Parkway poses “substantial and unacceptable adverse secondary impacts to the Greater Everglades.”

In a letter last week to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Environmental Protection Agency said a six-lane toll in West Kendall would produce direct impacts to 350 acres of freshwater wetlands in the Bird Drive Basin, an area that’s key to guaranteeing drinking water for Miami and the Florida Keys. The EPA considers the area an “aquatic resource of national importance.“

The questions from the EPA are only the latest hurdles for a project that already under fire from legal challenges, political disputes and forecasts that traffic improvements would be limited.

The letter was sent in response to a permit application to build over the wetlands by Miami-Dade Expressway Authority, or MDX, the county toll agency that proposed the roadway.

In the Aug. 23 letter, the EPA said that MDX proposal came up short of analysis on several fronts: There was not sufficient information on alternatives to minimize environmental impacts. The agency had failed to show that the project complies with environmental regulation that would allow for the degradation of wetlands. The EPA also asked MDX to explain if it had considered the effects from potential induced development in the areas that surround the proposed highway.

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is in the midst of reviewing MDX’s application to build over protected wetlands. Public comments closed on Aug. 23. The Corps will make the final decision on issuing a permit.

Javier Rodriguez, the MDX director, downplayed the letter during a meeting of the board Tuesday, only the second since a Florida judge reinstated the government agency after a new state law dissolved it for a new toll board called the Greater Miami Expressway Agency. The law, signed by Gov. Ron DeSantis and backed by Miami-Dade Republicans in Tallahassee, is suspended pending an appeal of the Aug. 9 lower-court decision that declared the legislation unconstitutional.

Rodriguez said the MDX can provide EPA administrators the information needed to answer questions raised by the regulator. “They basically asked for information. We have that information,” Rodriguez said. “Our study effectively addresses all the concerns they have.”

The EPA letter draws the latest fault line in a highway debate that has divided some of Miami-Dade’s most prominent Republicans. On the one side is county Mayor Carlos Gimenez, the MDX’s appointed chairman who has led the charge to win county approval of the highway and tried to rally public support behind the $1 billion effort.

On the other is U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, who got his political start in Miami and touted the EPA’s letter in a Twitter post over the weekend all but declaring the 836 project dead. “Without EPA concurrence,” Rubio wrote, the Army Corps “will not approve #CleanWaterAct permits for #KendallParkway construction in Bird Road Basin.”

Gimenez questioned the confrontational role his fellow Republican has taken toward the 836 extension while not objecting to a trio of new toll roads approved by the Florida legislature this year for Florida. “He’s very focused on the Kendall Parkway, but he’s not focused at all on hundreds of miles of highway running through environmentally sensitive land,” Gimenez said during a break in the meeting. Rubio’s office had no immediate comment.

Bird Drive Basin was once part of the Shark River Slough, the main artery for water flow in the Everglades. It’s used to recharge the region’s shallow Biscayne aquifer, the only drinking water source for communities in Miami-Dade and Miccosukee Tribe. It’s also home to native animals, wading birds and rare plants.

“Freshwater wetlands are essential to the region because they provide important water quality and wildlife benefits, and serve as a filtration system that protect bodies of water,” Jeaneanne Gettle, Director of EPA’s Water Division in Atlanta, wrote in the letter.

Because of its key location and the functions that it serves, Bird Drive Basin is part of the Everglades Restoration Plan, and was earmarked for restoration work to reestablish water flow south through the river of grass. Much of that land is already owned by the South Florida Water Management District and the U.S. Department of the Interior. The Miccosukee also own land acquired to restore the tribe’s historic homelands.

Environmentalists and a developer sued MDX and Miami-Dade, arguing the project would violate the county’s growth management plan. They warned that allowing the road to get so close to the Everglades would encourage more suburban sprawl and development that could endanger protected wetlands.

South Florida water managers and the Florida Department of Environmental Protection had already raised red flags over the lack of details about the impact of the road on natural resources, water supply and flood control."

Reed asks U.S. Justice Department to investigate Cuomo over refusal to fix Thruway,https://buffalonews.com,['Harold Mcneil'],08-27-2019,2019,8,https://buffalonews.com/2019/08/27/tom-reed-cuomo-road-seneca-nation-thruway-money/,"Rep. Tom Reed is asking U.S. Attorney General William Barr to investigate Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo over the state's lack of action in repairing a crumbling three-mile stretch of the Thruway on the Cattaraugus Indian Reservation in Erie and Chautauqua counties.

Reed, who was joined Tuesday by Chautauqua County Executive George M. Borrello outside the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of New York in Buffalo, told reporters that Cuomo is holding the traveling public hostage in the governor's dispute with the Seneca Nation of Indians over casino gaming revenues. A portion of the road runs through territory owned by the Senecas.

Cuomo last week vowed not to fix the road because it might give the Senecas an excuse not to pay $255 million in casino revenues the governor says they owe the state and local governments.

""I don't want to give them a reason to say New York breached the agreement by coming onto I-90 when they had no right to come onto I-90. That could actually jeopardize our position on the revenues,"" Cuomo is reported to have said during an Aug. 20 news conference in Wilson.

Reed Tuesday said that is a tacit admission by the governor that exacting political revenge is the motivation behind not repairing the stretch of the I-90 between Exits 57A and 58, even though the U.S. Department of Transportation has allocated millions of dollars for the repairs.

""This is an unrelated matter that does not need to be mixed up with the traveling public safety on that interstate, and so we are asking the Department of Justice to investigate this potential misuse of dollars that have been rightfully allocated to this interstate at the federal level, but have not been deployed to fix this road,"" Reed said.

""To put the traveling public at risk is just wrong. It's time to fix that road (and) make sure that our public safety is paramount,"" he added.

Reed, a Corning Republican, said the Democratic governor's statement contradicts a statement made earlier this month by Lt. Gov. Kathy Hochul, who said the Thruway issue is independent of the dispute with the Senecas.

Rich Azzopardi, a senior adviser to the governor, issued a statement Tuesday in response to Reed's allegations.

""Weaponizing law enforcement to score dumb political points may be what the congressman's buddy, the president, does, but it doesn't mean it's right,"" Azzopardi said.

""He should stop with the cheap stunts, do his job, represent his constituents and demand that the Senecas pay their fair share under the arbitration they agreed to,"" Azzopardi added.

Meanwhile, Borrello, on Tuesday, said he has heard from numerous motorists who travel the stretch of road who have experienced broken tie rods and other damage to their vehicles, as well as losing control of their vehicles.

""The fact that they are paying for the right to have their cars damaged and risk their lives is absolutely unacceptable,"" Borrello said.

""This is something that has been ignored largely by the governor for the last three years, at least. And now we're talking about it again,"" Borrello added.

Meanwhile, Reed said he wants the U.S. Department of Justice to not only look into potential misuse of powers he alleges may have been committed the governor regarding the Thruway issue, but also the potential misappropriation of federal funds.

""If that money, tens of millions of dollars, has come to the state, has been duly appropriated and authorized by the federal government, where are those dollars? Where are they sitting? Have they been applied to other sources?"" said Reed."

The State Department on Monday announced the political scientist Peter Berkowitz as the head of policy planning, a post that puts him in charge of long-term strategic thinking for the department.

Berkowitz, who was already working in the Office of Policy Planning, will replace his former boss, Kiron Skinner, who was dismissed earlier this month over concerns about her management style.

Story Continued Below

The announcement came in an internal email to select State Department officials on Monday morning, according to one of those officials.

Berkowitz, who has taught both constitutional law and political philosophy, came to the State Department from Stanford University’s Hoover Institution. He is the author of four books on subjects ranging from conservatism and progressivism to the ethics of Nietzsche.

Under former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, the Department of Policy Planning — which has historically operated as the State Department’s internal think tank — played a key role in the day-to-day management of the department.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who works closely with a team of special envoys, has returned it to its traditional role of churning out papers and proposals on long-range strategic issues.

Trump claims he has 'absolute right' to order US companies out of China under 1977 law,https://www.cnn.com,['Veronica Stracqualursi'],08-24-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/24/politics/trump-china-trade-war-emergency-economic-powers-act/index.html,"Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump claimed he has the ""absolute right"" to ""order"" US companies to stop doing business with China that would involve using his broad executive authority in a new and unprecedented way under a 1977 law.

On Friday, China unveiled a new round of retaliatory tariffs on about $75 billion worth of US goods, the latest escalation in an on-going trade war that's putting a strain on the world's two largest economies. In response, Trump wrote on Twitter later Friday: ""Our great American companies are hereby ordered to immediately start looking for an alternative to China including bringing ...your companies HOME and making your products in the USA.""

When leaving the White House for the G7 summit in France, Trump told reporters, ""I have the absolute right to do that, but we'll see how it goes."" He later explained that he was referring to the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), and in a Friday tweet wrote: ""For all of the Fake News Reporters that don't have a clue as to what the law is relative to Presidential powers, China, etc., try looking at the Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977. Case closed!""

Trump's latest comments again raise questions as to how far the President's authority goes under the IEEPA . In May, Trump threatened to slap Mexico with punitive tariffs unless it slowed the passage of migrants from Central America to the US. The IEEPA, according to the Congressional Research Service, has never been invoked to impose tariffs, and Trump ultimately drew back at the last minute.

The IEEPA, passed in the wake of Watergate and Vietnam, gives Trump ""broad authority to regulate a variety of economic transactions following a declaration of national emergency,"" according to an analysis by the CRS.

Those presidential powers can be used ""to deal with any unusual and extraordinary threat....to the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the United States.""

Under the IEEPA, the President has to consult with Congress before invoking his authority and, after declaring a national emergency, send a report to Congress explaining why.

This authority has been used frequently; there have been 54 national emergencies, 29 of which are ongoing. In the first use of the IEEPA, during the Iran hostage crisis in 1979, President Jimmy Carter imposed trade sanctions against Iran, freezing Iranian assets in the US, according to CRS.

Stephen Vladeck, a law professor at the University of Texas and a CNN legal analyst, told CNN in May that what Trump wanted to do under the law with Mexico may have been within the authority given to the White House by Congress -- though it might not have been what Congress ever intended.

""The idea behind these authorities is that the President is better situated to make those kinds of determinations than Congress, especially when they're time-sensitive,"" Vladeck told CNN at the time. ""So I think the President's conduct may well be within the letter of the law here. But, as with the National Emergencies Act, I very much doubt this kind of exercise of the authority conferred by the statute is what Congress had in mind.""

On Saturday, Vladeck again weighed in, tweeting: ""One of the enduring phenomena of the Trump era is going to be the list of statutes that give far too much power to the President, but that many didn't used to worry about—assuming there'd be political safeguards. Today's entrant: The International Emergency Economic Powers Act.""

Under the law, though, Congress can end an emergency with a joint resolution.

Former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld, who has mounted a longshot bid against Trump for the 2020 Republican presidential nomination, called it ""outrageous"" that a US President would tell US companies how to conduct business."
Scientists fight Trump EPA 'secret science' proposal to exclude certain research,https://thehill.com,[],08-27-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/459044-scientists-fight-trump-epa-secret-science-proposal-to-exclude,"Scientists on Tuesday pushed back against a Trump administration proposal that would block the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) from relying on studies that don’t make their underlying data public.

Current EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler Andrew Wheeler Five things to watch as Trump heads to G-7 summit Controversial husband and wife EPA duo to leave Washington The Hill's Morning Report - Trump touts new immigration policy, backtracks on tax cuts MORE had asked the EPA's Science Advisory Board (SAB) to weigh how the agency could work to deal with the numerous studies that anonymize or withhold sensitive data in order to protect personal information and confidential business information, an issue before the panel on Tuesday. ADVERTISEMENT

“If this is such a good idea, why is it proposed just for EPA rather than as legislation or regulation applying to all health-regulating agencies?” asked Roy Gamse, a former deputy assistant administrator at EPA.

Gamse joined multiple outside scientists using Tuesday's meeting to push the advisory panel to reject the proposal in its entirety.

“Imagine the Food and Drug Administration being forbidden to approve new drugs unless the research justifying their use were subject to these same regulatory prohibitions. ... Drug approvals would likely grind to a halt. As would EPA regulations for air quality standards, hazardous materials exposures, pesticides exposures, drinking water concentrations, etc.,” Gamse said.

Board members are working to create a tiered approach that might make the EPA’s proposed rule more functional. Studies with particularly sensitive data might be allowed higher levels of protection, such as hiding data behind a password-protected website.

“Many of the SAB members were very supportive regarding the importance of scientific transparency,” a spokesman for the EPA said in a statement to The Hill. “Today we heard a good discussion as the Board grapples with the details of how best to implement this proposed rule. EPA looks forward to getting the final consultation with all these ideas included.”

Some of the board members were indeed supportive of the effort.

Richard Williams, a board member and former economist with the Food and Drug Administration, said the proposal would be needed to avoid poorly performed studies that produce bad statistics.

“This is what this is trying to get after,” Williams said, adding that a tiered system will help the EPA use whatever studies it deems necessary.

Critics say the board has largely been sidelined by the EPA, as it has been asked to review only a narrow piece of the proposal.

The board somewhat rejected that call at its last meeting when it voted to review the proposal more broadly in addition to trying to find ways to deal with personal and business data.

Some have also voiced concerns that the board won’t finish its review of the EPA proposal in time to have an impact on the final rule, which is expected later this year.

“EPA’s reticence to give SAB the answers it needs to evaluate the rule further exemplifies that this rule presents a solution in search of a problem,” Genna Reed, lead science and policy analyst for the Union of Concerned Scientists said during the meeting’s public comment portion.

“The rule as drafted would waste enormous resources, make data more vulnerable to misuse and exploitation, and make it nearly impossible for the EPA to use the best available science to inform mission-critical decisions. We ask that the EPA fully utilize the SAB and consider its advice on this rule in its entirety,” she said.

Reed said the EPA’s proposal lacks basic information, such as a definition for data or how it could be replicable.

Critics have also raised concerns about the qualifications of those appointed under the Trump administration compared to previous board members. They noted that Pruitt barred scientists from the board if they received EPA grants, calling it a conflict of interest.

A report from the Government Accountability Office found more industry group representation on the board under Trump. It also said the EPA did not follow the process for selecting the “best qualified and most appropriate candidates” for the SAB and “did not ensure that all appointees met ethics requirements.”

Many of the board members on Tuesday questioned how they could even create a system that would allow for use of studies that shield sensitive information.

“I think the comments made from SAB members really illustrated exactly how messy the proposed rule is. Many of the members have trouble answering the simple charged questions that were proposed without going down rabbit holes on the glaring issues with the rule,” Reed said."
Dudley encourages the Fed to help sway the 2020 election against Trump,https://www.cnbc.com,['Jeff Cox'],08-27-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/27/dudley-encourages-the-fed-not-to-play-along-with-trumps-trade-war.html,"William C. Dudley, president and chief executive officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

Former New York Fed President Bill Dudley is calling on the central bank not to help President Donald Trump fight his trade war with China.

In a sharply worded commentary to his one-time colleagues, Dudley urged Fed officials not to lower interest rates simply as a backstop while the president continues his tit-for-tat tariff battle with the Chinese that has escalated in recent days.

""Central bank officials face a choice: enable the Trump administration to continue down a disastrous path of trade war escalation, or send a clear signal that if the administration does so, the president, not the Fed, will bear the risks — including the risk of losing the next election,"" he wrote in a post on the Bloomberg News site.

Dudley went so far as to suggest the Fed could — and should — try to influence the next election against Trump.

""After all, Trump's reelection arguably presents a threat to the U.S. and global economy, to the Fed's independence and its ability to achieve its employment and inflation objectives,"" he wrote. ""If the goal of monetary policy is to achieve the best long-term economic outcome, then Fed officials should consider how their decisions will affect the political outcome in 2020.""

A Fed spokesman said the central bank does not use politics as a guide for its decisions.

""The Federal Reserve's policy decisions are guided solely by its congressional mandate to maintain price stability and maximum employment. Political considerations play absolutely no role,"" the official said in a statement.

Some economists criticized Dudley's statement as inappropriate for a former central banker.

""We fear that the opinion column ... is likely to prove counterproductive for the current Fed leadership, which we are confident had no hand in the production of the opinion piece and has had to deny immediately that 'political considerations' play any part in policymaking,"" Krishna Guha, head of global policy at central bank strategy at Evercore ISI, said in a note.

United States Department of Defense Increases Deployment of Rekor Technology,https://finance.yahoo.com,[],08-27-2019,2019,8,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/united-states-department-defense-increases-113000911.html,"Expands use of Rekor’s proprietary vehicle recognition software to enhance existing camera networks following successful initial engagement

COLUMBIA, MD / ACCESSWIRE / August 27, 2019 / Rekor Systems, Inc, (REKR) (‘Rekor”) a Nasdaq company focused on bringing smarter, faster, cost-competitive solutions to the worlds of public safety and customer experience, announced today it has received a purchase order from the Department of Defense (DoD) to provide an additional 200 camera licenses for the Company’s vehicle recognition system. The DoD has now doubled its total camera licenses from Rekor, having originally purchased 200 licenses to use the Company’s machine-learning enabled vehicle recognition system in May of this year.

“We believe that both the initial selection and the rapid subsequent second purchase by the DoD confirms what we’ve long known about our technology - that it is the most robust vehicle recognition system on the market and a critical tool to support the important work of the world’s preeminent defense department,” said Robert A. Berman, President and CEO of Rekor. “Our solutions are easy to integrate, highly scalable and very cost efficient. By deploying our software within their existing infrastructure, our customers, including the DoD, can markedly enhance the functionality of their existing IP cameras by adding the most powerful vehicle recognition system in the world. What’s more, it’s all done without sacrificing any of the functionality of the existing system or the need to purchase new, expensive hardware.”

Rekor’s software enables automatic license plate and vehicle recognition through virtually any IP camera. Its industry-leading artificial intelligence-based solutions can be hosted locally or in the cloud. Enabled by machine learning from its robust and growing database covering over 70 countries, Rekor’s software can identify in real time vehicle license plate data, color, make, model and body type.

Rather than buying expensive cameras that take weeks or months to ship and install, Rekor’s software can be deployed to any existing IP camera immediately. This can represent a potential savings of tens of thousands of dollars per camera, as well as greater flexibility to expand or decrease usage as needed without large capital expenditures on hardware. It also eliminates the need for two separate cameras - one for lice plate reading functionality, one for general surveillance recording - as Rekor’s solution can be used to collect license plate data and information such as the make, model, and color of a vehicle using the same camera that provides surveillance monitoring.

Forward-Looking Statements

This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. Other than statements of historical facts, all statements contained in this press release are forward looking statements, including particularly statements regarding our future results of operations and financial position, business strategy, prospective products and services, timing and likelihood of success, plans and objectives of management for future operations, and future results of current and anticipated products and services. These statements involve uncertainties, such as known and unknown risks, and are dependent on other important factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from the future results, performance or achievements we express or imply. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expect,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “could,” “intend,” “target,” “project,” “contemplates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “predicts,” “potential” or “continue” or the negative of these terms or other similar expressions. All forward looking statements contained in this press release speak only as of the date on which they were made, are based on management's assumptions and estimates as of such date and are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including those described under the risk factors sections in our Annual and Quarterly Reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Because forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, some of which cannot be predicted or quantified and some of which are beyond our control, you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of the receipt of new information, the occurrence of future events, or otherwise.
