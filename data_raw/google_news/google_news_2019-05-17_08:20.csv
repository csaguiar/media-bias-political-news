"Ilhan Omar slams Trump's 'devastating' immigration plan, renews call to abolish ICE",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Joseph Wulfsohn', 'Joseph A. Wulfsohn Is A Media Reporter For Fox News. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/ilhan-omar-slams-trumps-devastating-immigration-plan-renews-call-to-abolish-ice,"Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn, blasted President Trump's newly-unveiled immigration plan Thursday and renewed her call to abolish the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency.

“Today the president has unveiled an immigration plan that makes no mention of DACA, a program Trump unilaterally ended in late 2017, that has been hanging by a thread thanks to court injunctions,” Omar began in a speech to liberal activists. “A plan that fails to make sure people with temporary protection status and deferred enforced departure recipients don’t have a path to a permanent status or citizenship. A plan that seeks to limit asylum seekers fleeing violence.”

Omar, a Somali refugee, insisted that Trump's plan would have a ""devastating effect on millions of people around the world"" like her and believed that the US, which she referred to as ""beacon of hope for the world,"" should provide immigrants a ""simple and accessible path to become documented"" and not ""dehumanize"" them or ""call them 'animals.'""

""So what are we asking for? What we are asking for is very simple. We need to make sure that we cut, and not put increases on spending on detention facilities. We need to stop using DHS as a slush fund,"" Omar continued. ""We need to abolish ICE and end all inhumane deportation and detention programs. We need to fight back against the criminalization of immigrants and those crossing the border. We need to create a fair and accessible path to legal status and citizenship for all undocumented people in the United States.”

In a speech given at the Rose Garden, President Trump detailed what he hoped would be included in a massive reform, including using a merit-based system for new migrants and ending the visa lottery.

Acosta opined from his account about a remark the president made about asylum seekers, accusing him of painting with a ""broad brush.""

""Trump in Rose Garden speech paints asylum seekers with broad brush accusing them of misleading immigration authorities at border: 'These are frivolous claims,'"" Acosta tweeted.

The official White House Twitter account shared a clip showing the president's full remarks on the issue, which seemingly slapped down Acosta's criticism.

""We must also restore the integrity of our broken asylum system. Our Nation has a proud history of affording protection to those fleeing government persecutions. Unfortunately, legitimate asylum seekers are being displaced by those lodging frivolous claims,"" Trump said. These are frivolous claims to gain admission into our country. Asylum abuse also strains our public school systems, hospitals, and local shelters.""

"Trump Admin Moves Fueled Iran’s Aggression, U.S. Intel Says",https://www.thedailybeast.com,"['Betsy-Woodruff Adam-Rawnsley', 'Betsy Woodruff', 'Adam Rawnsley']",05-17-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-admin-moves-fueled-irans-aggression-us-intel-says,"Trump administration hawks have spent the last two weeks decrying an increased threat from Iran. But U.S. intelligence officials assess that Iran’s aggressive moves came in response to the administration’s own actions.

Three U.S. government officials familiar with the situation told The Daily Beast that officials in multiple U.S. intelligence agencies have assessed that Iran’s new, threatening activity–which the administration points to in justifying its military presence in the Persian Gulf–is in response to the administration’s aggressive steps over the last two months. The National Security Council, the CIA, and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence did not provide comment for this story.

In addition, multiple lawmakers on Capitol Hill familiar with American intelligence about Iran told The Daily Beast that Tehran’s aggressive moves—reportedly planning attacks on U.S. diplomatic facilities in Iraq and loading missiles on fishing boats in the Gulf—appear to be in response to Washington’s moves to press the Islamic Republic and its leadership. The Trump administration’s decisions to tighten oil sanctions and to designate the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a terrorist group were particularly provocative, lawmakers said.

“Clearly the Iranians are not happy with the maximum pressure campaign that the U.S. is imposing on them, including the designation of the IRGC as a terrorist organization,” said Texas Republican Sen. John Cornyn. “And so I think they’re lashing out, and some of the threats are very concerning.”

Cornyn also said that if the U.S. had held back, the new Iranian threat may not have materialized when and how it did.

“As long as they’re having their way, maybe not, as long as that works for them,” he said. “But clearly, things are not working for them the way they had hoped.”

National Security Adviser John Bolton has previously said the administration’s aggressive efforts aim to squeeze Iran “until its leaders decide to change their destructive behavior, respect the rights of the Iranian people, and return to the negotiating table.” But the policy doesn’t appear to have put leaders there in a mood to make concessions.

In fact, as The Wall Street Journal first reported, Iran’s posture toward American interests became more hostile in direct response to the administration’s moves, according to the assessment of multiple U.S. intelligence officials.

“I would characterize the intelligence I’ve reviewed as very murky, as reflective of generally increasing tensions in the region, and I have developed a belief that most of the activities that the Iranians are undertaking are in response to our very aggressive posture in the region,” Rep. Jim Himes, a Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, told The Daily Beast.

Himes has vocally criticized the administration’s aggressive steps, recently in a USA Today op-ed with Sen. Chris Murphy, while Cornyn has praised the president’s moves.

A third lawmaker privy to classified information about the Iran threat also hinted at a connection between the administration’s actions and Iran’s increased belligerence.

“Without sharing any of the intelligence, the answer is, there’s nothing there that indicates that we should send B-52 bombers, a carrier fleet, and the Marines,” he said. “So what’s going on here? What’s going on here? Wagging the dog?”

“I don’t get the policy that is coming from the intelligence,” he added.

One source said that American intelligence officials assess that Qasem Soleimani, the commander of Iran’s covert action arm, thinks he can ease pressure by jabbing the U.S. with some act of retaliation. The Qods Force commander oversaw Iran’s support of Shia proxy groups during the peak of the Iraq war, when those militias killed hundreds of American troops with improvised explosive devices and rocket attacks. The source said that experience has informed Soleimani’s view of how to deal with the Trump administration’s latest moves. The Daily Beast previously reported that Soleimani has told proxy fighters in Iraq that a conflict with the U.S. will come soon.

The administration’s designation of the IRGC as a terrorist group is key, according to the sources. Before it happened, Maj. Gen. Mohammad Ali Jafari, then the commander of the IRGC, warned that “the US Army and American security forces stationed in West Asia (Middle-East) will lose their current status of ease and serenity.” According to Politico, senior officials in the Defense Department also pushed back against the designation, arguing it could provoke more Iranian aggression. Despite that, the Trump administration moved ahead with the designation and followed it up with new rounds of sanctions

The State Department later announced in April that the U.S. would stop issuing waivers that let countries buy oil without risk of U.S. sanctions. More recently, strategists inside and outside the Trump administration have been sketching out new rounds of sanctions which they hope would cripple the Iranian economy.

Republicans leaving a classified briefing for the House Armed Services Committee early Thursday morning praised the president’s decision to rush the deployment of a carrier strike group and bomber task force to the Persian Gulf.

“It’s not our job to be proportional,” said Rep. Paul Mitchell, a Michigan Republican on the committee who attended the classified briefing. “It’s our job to say, enough, and there are costs.”

But the idea that the maximum pressure campaign could lead to retaliation from Tehran makes sense to Iran watchers.

“The mystery has been why has it taken so long,” said Suzanne Maloney, an Iran scholar at the Brookings Institution who has long advocated a less bellicose approach to relations with Tehran. She said Iranian leaders have felt “boxed in” by the twin pressures of a desire to push back against the Trump campaign’s actions and wariness about what that might provoke.

The recent moves in the maximum pressure campaign, however, may have changed that calculus. “I think that’s what the Iranians came to appreciate, that they had less to lose after the series of announcements which came in April and early May and that it was time to deliver at least a subtle message.”

Behnam Ben Taleblu—a fellow at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, which has long pushed for Washington to challenge the Tehran regime—agreed that Iran appeared to be more willing to accept risk in its pushback against the Trump administration. “While strategic patience best explains Iran under Year One of maximum pressure, under Year Two their policy can be called graduated escalation. Even Iran's threats to leave the nuclear deal are calculated and calibrated, designed to increase the burden of formulating an appropriate response from Washington that can punish Tehran and deter escalation.”

At least in public, leaders in Washington and Tehran say they want to avoid conflict. On his official Twitter account, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei appeared to try to tamp down the recent tension. “We don’t seek a war nor do they. They know a war wouldn’t be beneficial for them,” he wrote on Tuesday.

Trump has echoed that sentiment. He reportedly balked at the recent planning by Bolton and other aides that could involve the deployment of 120,000 troops to the region in the event of conflict. The New York Times reported Trump told advisers in a Situation Room meeting on Wednesday that he doesn’t want war with Iran.

Instead, Trump has appealed to Iranian leaders to talk to him and told American reporters that “I’d like to see them call me.” Late Wednesday, the White House announced that Trump would meet with Swiss president Ueli Maurer, who acts as an official diplomatic intermediary between Iran and the U.S., to discuss “facilitating diplomatic relations and other international issues.”

Members of Congress who fear war with Iran say they hope Trump will err on the side of restraint. Rep. Mike Quigley, an Illinois Democrat on the House intelligence committee, said the situation could flare up fast.

“I hope he appreciates the fact that this is dry kindling, and these provocative actions have spread lighter fluid,” he said.

Frustrated House Democrats Pin Their Hopes on Mueller,https://www.nytimes.com,"['Glenn Thrush', 'Nicholas Fandos']",05-16-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/16/us/politics/impeaching-president-trump.html,"Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said Mr. Mueller was the only person who could clear up certain ambiguities about the report. Only Mr. Mueller, he said, could tell the American people “if he agrees with the fact that if he were not president, he would have been indicted” for the instances of obstruction identified in the report.

But talking with reporters at the Capitol on Thursday, Mr. Nadler conceded that the White House strategy had thus far succeeded in tamping down energy around the Mueller report and investigations. However, he added, “the temperature can rise very quickly when the first subpoena is adjudged in our favor, and we start getting witnesses.”

Over the past week, aides with the House Judiciary Committee have been negotiating with aides to Mr. Mueller to get the special counsel, who remains an employee of the Justice Department, to testify. Those talks grind on over the format and the length of his appearance, according to two people close to the deliberations.

It is not clear if he would appear alone or with key aides who helped draft the report, they said. Some committee Democrats have expressed the opinion that two top Mueller aides, Aaron M. Zebley and Andrew Weissmann, would feel less constrained about criticizing the president than Mr. Mueller.

Mr. Schiff’s staff has also been talking to Mr. Mueller’s office, and the congressman expressed optimism that a deal could be struck. “I think we’ll get there,” he said.

Peter Carr, a spokesman for the special counsel, declined to comment.

In the past, there has been jockeying between Mr. Nadler’s staff and aides to Mr. Schiff — but they are in agreement on sequencing. If Mr. Mueller agrees to appear, he would testify in an open session before the Judiciary Committee first, then appear before Mr. Schiff’s committee, most likely in public and closed-door sessions, Mr. Nadler said.

Mr. Trump has given conflicting answers over his feelings about Mr. Mueller’s testimony, after labeling his investigation a “witch hunt” in the months leading up to investigators’ conclusion that there was insufficient evidence to charge Mr. Trump, his campaign or his supporters with conspiring with the Kremlin."
Nellie Ohr deleted emails sent from husband's DOJ account,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-16-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/nellie-ohr-deleted-emails-sent-from-husbands-doj-account,"Nellie Ohr, the wife of Justice Department official Bruce Ohr, told her husband she was deleting emails sent from his government account.

The revelation comes as both Ohrs remain under intense scrutiny for their ties to Fusion GPS and British ex-spy Christopher Steele, the author of the anti-Trump dossier that was used to obtain warrants to wiretap a member of President Trump's 2016 campaign.

Conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch obtained a series of April 2016 emails from a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit against the Justice Department that show a correspondence between the Ohrs, an aide to Bruce Ohr named Lisa Holtyn, and Stefan Bress, a first secretary at the German Embassy.

They discussed setting up a dinner for the German delegation as well as a meeting to discuss Russian organized crime. Included in a proposed agenda is the “Impact of Russian influence operations in Europe (‘PsyOps/InfoWar’).”

On April 20, responding to the email thread with the subject line, “Analyst Russian Organized Crime – April 2016,"" came the email from Nellie Ohr about deleting the emails. ""Thanks! I’m deleting these emails now,"" she said.

Bruce Ohr was an associate deputy attorney general and director of the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force while his wife Nellie was an independent contractor and Russia specialist.

Emails previously released by Judicial Watch show Bruce Ohr acting as an unofficial back channel between the FBI and Steele. He was demoted when it was revealed he met with Steele and Glenn Simpson, the co-founder of the opposition research firm Fusion GPS, which commissioned Steele's work. Ohr also told lawmakers his wife shared a thumb drive with him to hand over to the FBI.

The dossier, which contained unverified claims about Trump's ties to Russia, has been a subject of concern for GOP lawmakers, particularly for how it was used by the FBI in Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant applications to gain the authority to spy on onetime Trump campaign adviser Carter Page.

Nellie Ohr conducted research on connections between Russia and Trump, having been contracted by Fusion GPS.

Both Ohrs testified last year to a joint task force of the House Oversight and Judiciary committees that were investigating decisions made by the Justice Department and FBI surrounding the 2016 election. This month, Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., sent a criminal referral addressed to Attorney General William Barr, citing concerns that Nellie Ohr ""knowingly provided false testimony"" to lawmakers.

Judicial Watch president Tom Fitton said that Nellie Ohr informing her husband about deleting the emails indicates a pattern of covering up a plot against Trump. “This email is disturbing and suggests documents relevant to the improper targeting of President Trump were destroyed,” Fitton said in a statement."
"EPA Watchdog Finds Ex-Chief Scott Pruitt Spent $124,000 On 'Excessive' Airfare",https://www.npr.org,['Nathan Rott'],05-16-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/16/724018737/epa-watchdog-finds-ex-chief-scott-pruitt-spent-124-000-on-excessive-airfare,"EPA Watchdog Finds Ex-Chief Scott Pruitt Spent $124,000 On 'Excessive' Airfare

Enlarge this image toggle caption Pete Marovich/Getty Images Pete Marovich/Getty Images

Scott Pruitt, the former head of the Environmental Protection Agency, and his staff spent roughly $124,000 in excessive travel costs during a ten-month period, according to a new report from EPA's internal watchdog.

Pruitt, who resigned from EPA almost a year ago amidst a litany of ethics allegations, and his personal security detail flew in first or business class ""without sufficient justification and, initially without appropriate approval authority,"" the report says.

The EPA's Office of the Inspector General recommended that the agency consider recovering the estimated $123,942 in excessive costs.

In a statement, the EPA says it believes that it complied with federal travel regulations, ""making cost recovery inappropriate.""

The audit reviewed 40 trips, including six canceled ones, that Pruitt planned or took in 2017. Nearly half of those trips stopped in, or were to, Tulsa, Okla., where Pruitt maintained a personal residence while he was the nation's top environmental steward. The report found ""missing detailed support"" for some of those trips.

The travel during that ten-month period cost taxpayers almost $1 million.

Pruitt's 24-hour security detail ate up most of that money. In a previous audit, EPA's inspector general found that the agency spent twice as much protecting Pruitt as it did his predecessor.

The EPA and Pruitt, who now works as a consultant for coal companies, said those protections were necessary because of personal threats against the former-administrator.

During his 16-month stint as head of the EPA, Pruitt's security costs, travel and other actions drew criticism from his predecessors, Democrats, environmental groups and even some Republican lawmakers.

The EPA's inspector general says the office received numerous congressional requests and hotline complaints about Pruitt's travel. The new report came as a result of those.

In addition to first-class travel, the audit found that lodging expenses exceeded per diem limits during some of Pruitt's travel as well. There was also inaccurate or incomplete reports for international travel.

Pruitt is not the first member of the Trump administration to be questioned about his travel on the taxpayer dime.

Tom Price, the former head of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, broke federal rules on using chartered and military planes for government travel. Price resigned amidst controversy over that, as President Trump complained that he ""didn't like the optics"" of using taxpayer-funded charter flights.

A report by the Interior Department's inspector general found that former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke violated the agency's travel policy by having his wife travel with him in government vehicles.

The EPA's watchdog says that actions are needed to strengthen controls over travel at the agency to ""prevent fraud, waste and abuse."""
Treasury Official Hired to Fix Fannie and Freddie Is Leaving,https://www.nytimes.com,['Emily Flitter'],05-16-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/16/business/craig-phillips-treasury-fannie-mae-freddie-mac.html,"Investors snapped up Fannie’s and Freddie’s shares in anticipation. One of the big bettors was the hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management, run by William A. Ackman, which first took a position in the shares in 2013. The fund held 116 million Fannie shares at the end of March, according to securities filings compiled by FactSet, a data provider. That position would currently be worth more than $300 million.

Shares of both Fannie and Freddie have more than doubled this year, although they are still far below their pre-crisis levels.

But overhauling Fannie and Freddie has proved to be a complicated and politically thorny endeavor. The Obama administration tried and failed. Congress is deeply divided on the issue, which has the potential to affect the lives and finances of tens of millions of Americans.

Trump administration officials have been trying to jump-start the overhaul efforts this year, but with limited results.

Mr. Phillips and other Treasury officials have been meeting with the biggest American banks to determine how best to raise capital for Fannie and Freddie — a prerequisite to releasing them from government control — as well as how the housing finance system might be restructured, according to two people who participated in the meetings.

Mark Calabria, the recently confirmed head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which oversees Fannie and Freddie, said in a speech this week that he had the power to release the companies back into the private sector. But, he said, Congress would need to act to make such a plan viable by empowering the agency to better regulate the privatized companies.

Mr. Phillips is not the only confidant of Mr. Mnuchin on his way out. The Treasury’s assistant secretary for international markets, Heath Tarbert, has been nominated to be chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and will leave if confirmed by the Senate. And Eli Miller, who was Mr. Mnuchin’s chief of staff, left in April to join the private equity firm Blackstone."

CFPB Chief Says Education Department Is Blocking Student Loan Oversight,https://www.npr.org,['Chris Arnold'],05-16-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/16/723568597/cfpb-chief-says-education-department-is-blocking-student-loan-oversight,"CFPB Chief Says Education Department Is Blocking Student Loan Oversight

Enlarge this image toggle caption J. Scott Applewhite/AP J. Scott Applewhite/AP

The director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau says the Trump administration's Education Department is getting in the way of efforts to police the student loan industry. The revelation, in a letter obtained by NPR, comes at the same time that lawsuits allege that widespread wrongdoing by student loan companies is costing some borrowers thousands of dollars.

CFPB Director Kathy Kraninger explained the problem in an April letter responding to questions from Sen. Elizabeth Warren and other lawmakers about whether the federal regulator had ""abandoned its supervision and enforcement activities"" related to more than $1 trillion in student loans.

A central issue is that companies that manage student loans, known as student loan servicers, are refusing to share information that the CFPB says it needs to perform proper oversight.

""Since December 2017,"" Kraninger wrote in the letter, ""student loan servicers have declined to produce information requested by the Bureau for supervisory examinations"" related to federal student loans.

She said servicers are not sharing the information because the Department of Education has issued guidance telling them not to do so, citing ""privacy"" concerns. Kraninger also said that information from student loan servicers is ""necessary for supervisory examinations.""

The letter is a carefully worded response to senators' questions. But Kraninger, a Trump administration appointee, is in essence saying that the CFPB is trying to do its job protecting student borrowers and supervising loan servicing companies, but the Education Department is getting in the way.

""It's actually quite remarkable,"" says Seth Frotman, executive director of the nonprofit Student Borrower Protection Center. ""The head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is telling the world that the secretary of education has put in place a series of policies that are obstructing federal law enforcement officials from standing up for the millions of Americans with student debt.""

Frotman used to be the CFPB's student loan ombudsman but quit last summer over frustrations with the Trump administration. In a scathing resignation letter last August, he said the Trump administration was ""turning its back on student borrowers"" and preventing him from doing his job.

Now Kraninger, the administration's hand-picked director for the bureau, is pointing the finger, albeit in a less dramatic way, at the Education Department for hindering efforts to protect student borrowers.

In response to Kraninger's letter, Elizabeth Warren, Sherrod Brown, and three other Democratic senators called the revelations ""disturbing"" in a round of letters they fired off this week to loan servicing companies.

The lawmakers say in their letters that since Kraninger says the CFPB has attempted to get documents it needs for supervision and been rebuffed by the servicers, that ""reveals that the Department under Secretary DeVos, has removed the most potent weapon from the CFPB's arsenal to fight illegal behavior and mistreatment of borrowers by student loan servicers, and that federal student loan servicers, who are paid by the federal government, are ignoring federal regulators' requests for information.""

The senators' letters add that no ""guidance"" from the Department of Education ""can absolve servicers of their legal responsibility to comply with state and federal consumer protection law.""

Student borrowers getting hurt

When Jessica Saint-Paul heard about a program called Public Service Loan Forgiveness, she was ecstatic. For borrowers who work in qualifying public service jobs — such as police officers, government workers, people who work at nonprofit organizations — the program promises that if they make loan payments for 10 years, the remainder of their student debt will be forgiven. Saint-Paul had about $80,000 in student loans and she wasn't making much money working for a nonprofit that provides services to foster children.

""I was just like, 'Oh, this is perfect,' "" Saint-Paul says. So she called the company that was servicing her student loans and says she was told she was all set — after 10 years, she should be eligible to get her loans forgiven. That was nine years ago.

Saint-Paul said she called back over the years, including once when she changed nonprofit jobs in 2014, to say, ""just making sure I'm on track."" She says she was told, "" 'OK, no problem.' The conversation was quick; they were so kind.""

The call center workers might have been friendly, but Saint-Paul says she was getting bad information. She says she found that out just last year at a conference she attended. There was an information session on loan forgiveness, and she was told she was in the wrong kind of loan and wrong payment plan so she couldn't qualify. She says many other people were finding out the same thing alongside her at the conference.

""It was like a support group almost it turned into because people were like, 'No, that can't be true,' "" Saint-Paul says. ""I went on my phone, people were on their laptops checking what kind of loan they were in. We were all sitting there just frantic.""

Saint-Paul says that if nine years ago her loan servicer had just told her to convert to the right loan and payment plan, everything would have been OK. Instead, she says she feels as though someone stole tens of thousands of dollars from her.

""I just cannot believe this happened to me,"" she says. ""That's like criminal, it's not right.""

Many people agree that it's not right — regulators and advocacy groups are filing a growing number of lawsuits against loan servicing companies alleging mishandling of the loan forgiveness program. Saint-Paul is a plaintiff in one of them.

Many of the consumer complaints and lawsuits involve allegations that servicing companies gave borrowers bad information or advice that resulted in them thinking they were getting credit toward loan forgiveness, when in fact they were in the wrong loan or payment plan.

The Education Department revealed late last year that about 99% of borrowers who thought they had reached that 10-year milestone and applied for forgiveness were rejected. More than 1 million people are actively pursuing loan forgiveness under the program and hoping to qualify.

That's why Democratic lawmakers say they want to make sure that perhaps the most powerful watchdog — the CFPB — is on top of all this.

Fears that the watchdog has been asleep

Since 2011, the CFPB has monitored loan servicers, lenders and complaints from student borrowers and brought enforcement actions when it discovered wrongdoing. For example, the CFPB in 2015 returned $480 million to allegedly defrauded students of Corinthian Colleges.

In 2017, the CFPB brought a lawsuit against one of the nation's largest student loan servicers, Navient. The bureau said Navient ""created obstacles to repayment by providing bad information, processing payments incorrectly, and failing to act when borrowers complained. Through shortcuts and deception, the company also illegally cheated many struggling borrowers out of their rights to lower repayments, which caused them to pay much more than they had to for their loans."" That lawsuit is ongoing.

Navient disputes the allegations in the CFPB lawsuit and other suits brought by state regulators. ""The allegations made in the claims are unfounded, and we are vigorously defending our record in court,"" a Navient spokesman says.

But since Richard Cordray, the bureau's Obama-era director, stepped down in November 2017, consumer advocates have been worried that the Trump-appointed interim director, Mick Mulvaney, and now the permanent director, Kraninger, have backed away from protecting student borrowers.

But in her letter, Kraninger said the consumer protection bureau takes that job seriously.

""As with all industries subject to the Bureau's supervisory or enforcement authority, the Bureau will continue to monitor those subject to its authority — in this case, student lenders and student loan servicers — to ensure they are complying with the law,"" she wrote.

At the same time, Kraninger also explained that the Education Department has created obstacles that are getting in the way of the CFPB doing its job. In addition to the guidance to student loan servicers that is impeding oversight efforts, back in 2017, the Trump administration's Education Department ended information sharing agreements that it had with the CFPB. In her letter, Kraninger said an information-sharing agreement (called a Memorandum of Understanding) is required under law and it is ""a priority"" for the bureau to get a new one in place.

Some advocates say the CFPB should do more than acknowledge such problems in a letter to lawmakers. Frotman, of the Student Borrower Protection Center, says the bureau has broad powers to compel student loan servicing companies to turn over the information it needs about student loans and student borrowers.

""I think just identifying this fact is of little solace to student loan borrowers who desperately need the help of a consumer financial watchdog that is supposed to be independent,"" Frotman says. He says he'd like to see Kraninger more directly demand that the Education Department change its guidance to loan servicers and tell them to cooperate with regulators. The CFPB could also take loan servicers to court to get the information it needs., Frotman says.

In a statement to NPR, the CFPB said: ""The Bureau continues to supervise the student loan market, as well as taking action against those who fail to comply with the law."" And the bureau says it is confident it can resolve the issues to achieve its mission of protecting borrowers.

But for its part the Education Department appears to be defending its stance — that loan servicers not hand over information to the CFPB. The department says in a statement that it takes privacy seriously along with the need to ""protect customers' personal data."" It says requests for information about student loan borrowers should be made to the department.

State regulators also say Education Department impeding oversight

Last month, 21 state attorneys general sent Education Secretary Betsy DeVos a letter calling on her to ""reverse the limitations"" the department has placed on student loan servicing companies sharing information with state law enforcement agencies.

The attorneys general said ""student loan information is vital to our efforts to protect consumers from illegal, unfair, abusive, or deceptive practices by actors in the higher education industry, in which the Department historically has been an important partner. However, the Department's policy reversal impedes states' ability to enforce the law and shields unprincipled industry actors from regulatory enforcement, harming student loan borrowers nationwide.""

The industry group the Student Loan Servicing Alliance told NPR in a statement, ""As contractors of the Department of Education which owns its federal student loan data, federal servicers must follow federal law and ED guidance on disclosure and data sharing.""

Why not just share the information?

It's not clear why the department is blocking state and federal regulators from getting information from servicers to do oversight presumably aimed at protecting the rights of student borrowers.

Jason Delisle, a fellow at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute, says there may be a turf war going on here. Even if a particular student loan program has problems, Delisle says the department may feel, ""this is our program and we're designing it the way we want to design it and we're running it the way we want to run it."" And Delisle says if there are problems the department may feel it can sort them out by itself.

Frotman says that's not the issue. He says the Education Department may not like having regulators looking into alleged wrongdoing within the companies managing its loan programs, but ""this isn't about reasonable disagreements, it is about following the law versus obstructing law enforcement."""
"China's Huawei, 70 affiliates placed on U.S. trade blacklist",https://www.reuters.com,"['David Shepardson', 'Min Read']",05-16-2019,2019,5,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-china-huaweitech/chinas-huawei-70-affiliates-placed-on-us-trade-blacklist-idUSKCN1SL2W4,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Commerce Department said on Wednesday it is adding Huawei Technologies Co Ltd and 70 affiliates to its so-called “Entity List” - a move that bans the telecom giant from buying parts and components from U.S. companies without U.S. government approval.

U.S. officials told Reuters the decision would also make it difficult if not impossible for Huawei, the largest telecommunications equipment producer in the world, to sell some products because of its reliance on U.S. suppliers.

Under the order that will take effect in the coming days, Huawei will need a U.S. government license to buy American technology. Huawei did not immediately comment.

Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a statement President Donald Trump backed the decision that will “prevent American technology from being used by foreign owned entities in ways that potentially undermine U.S. national security or foreign policy interests.”

The dramatic move comes as the Trump administration has aggressively lobbied other countries not to use Huawei equipment in next-generation 5G networks and comes just days after the Trump administration imposed new tariffs on Chinese goods amid an escalating trade war.

The Commerce Department said the move comes after the U.S. Justice Department unsealed an indictment in January of Huawei and some entities that said the company had conspired to provide prohibited financial services to Iran. The department said it has a reasonable basis to conclude that Huawei is “engaged in activities that are contrary to U.S. national security or foreign policy interest.”

Huawei reported first-quarter revenue of $27 billion last month and said it had shipped 59 million smartphones in the first quarter.

In March 2016, the Commerce Department added ZTE Corp to the entity list over allegations it organized an elaborate scheme to hide its re-export of U.S. items to sanctioned countries in violation of U.S. law.

The restrictions prevented suppliers from providing ZTE with U.S. equipment, potentially freezing the Huawei rival’s supply chain, but they were short-lived. The U.S. suspended the restrictions in a series of temporary reprieves, allowing the company to maintain ties to U.S. suppliers until it agreed to a plea deal a year later.

In August, Trump signed a bill that barred the U.S. government itself from using equipment from Huawei and ZTE.

Senator Ben Sasse, a Republican, said “Huawei’s supply chain depends on contracts with American companies” and he urged the Commerce Department to look “at how we can effectively disrupt our adversary.”"

The 84-page report says the $123,942 figure is out of a total of $985,037 spent on 40 trips between March 1 and December 31, 2017.

The IG says the spending was ""excessive"" because it was improperly approved ""without sufficient justification"" or by someone who did not have authority to approve it.

The EPA took issue with the characterization that the spending was ""excessive,"" and rejected the inspector general's recommendation that the agency ask Pruitt and others to pay back that amount.

Pruitt took the top EPA job in February 2017, and his early months in office were marked by frequent taxpayer-funded travel to his home state of Oklahoma. That and other ethical scandals would ultimately lead to his resignation in the summer of 2018.

Cramer: Trump no longer cares if his China policies hurt American businesses,https://www.cnbc.com,['Tyler Clifford'],05-16-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/16/cramer-trump-doesnt-care-his-china-policies-hurt-american-businesses.html,"On Wednesday, the Trump administration made a national emergency via executive order to regulate any business dealing with information or communications technology that ""poses an unacceptable risk to the national security of the United States."" The move bans American businesses from buying equipment from Huawei and requires a special license to sell components to the company, Cramer highlighted.

""Huawei has the best technology for the 5G wireless infrastructure build-out, but without components from American suppliers, that technology just doesn't work. They're gonna get beat,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""It could be the end for Huawei's 5G leadership. That's a huge blow to this pioneering company that many in the industry actually feel is nothing but an arm of the [Chinese] Communist Party.""

That tanked the shares of a group of chipmakers — Qualcomm , Skyworks Solutions , Broadcom , Micron , and Xilinx — as much as 7.3%, he argued.

President Donald Trump has practically ""blacklisted"" Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei and made it crystal clear that he does not want American companies doing business with the country, CNBC's Jim Cramer said Thursday.

The semiconductor exchange-trade fund, which tracks chip stocks, slid 1.4%.

""This was a major escalation from the White House. Trump did the same thing to a smaller Chinese company not that long ago, ZTE, although he quickly walked it back,"" Cramer said. ""This one feels different ... It's clear the president no longer cares if his actions hurt major American businesses.""

Although several semiconductor names took a hit in the session, the major U.S. indexes all gained less than 1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added about 214 points, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite gained 0.89% and 0.97% respectively.

""It's not that we rallied. It's that the components of the rally actually made a ton of sense,"" Cramer said. ""This was a day where we separated the China winners from the China losers, and that allowed many stocks to roar based on good old-fashioned earnings per share.""

Cisco popped 6.7% and Walmart, which has exposure to China, climbed 1.43%. The host called them the ""surprise winners.""

Cramer said many expected Cisco to stumble, but the networking equipment maker beat earnings and revenue estimates. Walmart, which has been investing in its digital business and other areas, provided better-than-expected earnings per share and grew U.S. sales by 3.4%.

""They expressed a degree of immunity to the tariffs that stunned Wall Street,"" Cramer said. ""These companies were widely perceived to be caught in the Chinese crossfire. Turns out that's just not quite true.""

That's unlike the assets of Ralph Lauren and Macy's, who finished another day in the red. Earlier this week, their shares rallied off good quarterly reports but fell after revealing their exposure to China.

Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins told shareholders that they see minimal impact from tariffs on Chinese imports after preparing for the worse six months ago and shifting sourcing out of the country.

Walmart has warned that it will have to raise its prices if Trump goes through with his promises to slap another 25% tariff on $300 billion, on top of the existing $200 billion, worth of Chinese imports.

Luckily the department behemoth doesn't ship food from the country, meaning their grocery prices can stay low, Cramer said. Furthermore, the retail giant can weather the storm with its massive scale because it ""can source better than any other retailer on earth, save maybe Amazon. ""

If Walmart needs to change suppliers, they will do so and still have better prices than their competitors, he said, adding that he's more concerned about the strong American dollar's negative impact on the chain's international sales.

""Here's how I see it: President Trump is now in charge. He's in charge of which American companies can do business in China. If you do too much, he'll smite you. If you buy too much, he'll find you. If you rely on them too much, he'll crush you,"" Cramer said. ""The companies that didn't see this escalation coming, they may get stream-rolled, but the ones that thought ahead are being re-rated to more exalted status ... I think their stocks aren't done going higher."""
The Energy 202: Trump's Interior chief hasn't 'lost any sleep over' new climate record,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Dino Grandoni', 'Reporter Covering Energy', 'Environmental Policy', 'May At Am']",05-16-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-energy-202/2019/05/16/the-energy-202-trump-s-interior-chief-hasn-t-lost-any-sleep-over-new-climate-record/5cdc4fd01ad2e5092403d1da/,"THE LIGHTBULB

House Democrats grilled Interior Secretary David Bernhardt about what his department is doing to address the causes and effects of climate change, noting that levels of carbon dioxide just hit their highest in human history.

His response? “I haven’t lost any sleep over it.”

The exchange is the latest escalation between congressional Democrats and the Trump administration over what responsibility the Interior Department, which oversees more than 400 million acres of federal lands, bears in blunting a worldwide problem such as global warming. It came amid a barrage of legal citations from Democrats who claimed that current law compels the leader of the department to protect public lands from its impacts.

The remark came as Rep. Matt Cartwright (D-Pa.) pressed Bernhardt about how concerned, on a scale of 1 to 10, he was about the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere eclipsing 415 parts per million, as recorded by the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii.

“Okay, so you're a zero or a one, is that it?” Cartwright said in response.

Later in the hearing, Rep. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.) gave Bernhardt the chance to expand on his comment, saying that for climate scientists it is a “hair-on-fire crisis.”

“It’s one of those clips of testimony that will reverberate,” he said. “People will look back to what you said.”

Indeed, after the hearing, environmental groups shared widely on social media videos of Bernhardt's “sleep” comment.

In response, Bernhardt said: “I absolutely care that our climate is changing and that we need to factor that into our thinking. I absolutely believe that. And I've said that over and over and over.”

He noted that among developed nations, the United States is “number one” in reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

The hearing Wednesday in front of the House Natural Resources Committee, ostensibly to discuss the Trump administration's budget proposal for the department, was Bernhardt's second since being confirmed as interior secretary.

Last week in front of a House Appropriations subcommittee, Bernhardt punted the climate issue to Congress, telling members it was up to them to pass legislation compelling him to reduce emissions from public lands. Between 2005 and 2014, a quarter of the nation's carbon dioxide emissions came from the extracting and burning of fossil fuels from federal lands.

“There's no 'shalls,' "" Bernhardt said, referring to the word in law that indicates a legally binding requirement. “You guys come up with the 'shalls.' ""

In the intervening days, House Democrats had clearly dusted off law books.

During the hearing, Rep. Diana DeGette (D-Colo.) chided the Trump administration for rolling back an Obama-era rule that sought to limit the amount of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, released by oil and gas wells on the Bureau of Land Management lands.

And another Democrat, Mike Levin of California, rattled off four laws that, for example, compel the interior secretary to ensure that national parks are “unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations” and to “take any action necessary to prevent unnecessary or undue degradation” to BLM areas.

Bernhardt suggests the language in those laws did not direct him to do anything specific in response to climate change, such as stop leasing land for coal, oil or natural gas extraction.

“What I specifically said is you haven’t given me any direction to stop any particular activity,” he said.

John Leshy, interior solicitor under President Clinton, said that the legal language authorizing the government's land management programs is “necessarily general.”

“I give Bernhardt credit,” Leshy told The Post. “He's a wily guy.”

Leshy said Levin could also have mentioned the Endangered Species Act, which compels the interior secretary to use the “best available” science to determine whether a plant or animal is under threat of extinction.

On the dangers of climate change to biodiversity, he said, “the science is increasingly clear.”

At one point in yesterday's hearing, Democrats got Bernhardt to acknowledge that some laws — including the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), which requires agencies to evaluate the environmental impact of their actions — compel him to take climate change into account when managing lands.

“Certainly, NEPA would be one to them.”

Correction: The original version of this story referred to California Rep. Mike Levin as Mark Levin.

The Trump administration’s attitude to climate change, and our country's fate, in one sentence from @SecBernhardt: ""I haven't lost any sleep over it.""

— Controversial mining leases renewed: BLM has renewed two federal minerals leases for a proposed copper-nickel mine by Minnesota mining company Twin Metals. The controversial decision follows a years-long clash over opening the state to minerals mining, the Star Tribune reports. The leases were ended by the Obama administration in 2016 over concerns about the environmental risks of mining near a protected wilderness, the Boundary Waters Canoe Area.

Trump administration touts economic benefit of new mining: “Mining on public lands balances conservation . . . with the need to produce minerals that add value to the lives of all Americans by providing raw materials used in the manufacture of medical aids, automobiles, smartphones and computers, and household appliances,” said Joe Balash, the interior's assistant secretary for land and minerals management.

“Mining on public lands balances conservation . . . with the need to produce minerals that add value to the lives of all Americans by providing raw materials used in the manufacture of medical aids, automobiles, smartphones and computers, and household appliances,” said Joe Balash, the interior's assistant secretary for land and minerals management. But Minnesota lawmakers are gearing up for a fight: ""Every sulfide-ore mine has failed to contain pollution and has affected the surrounding water quality,"" said Rep. Betty McCollum (D-Minn.). ""Once polluted, this incredible landscape and its wildlife will never been the same.""

— 2020 watch: Two Democratic presidential candidates, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, are out this week with new climate policies.

Warren: In a post on Medium, Warren laid out a plan requiring the Pentagon to reach net-zero carbon emissions for its infrastructure and non-combat bases by 2030. Her plan also calls for creating a “dedicated source of funding to adapt our bases in the United States and around the world."" It also targets contractors hired by the Defense Department, proposing that any contractor that doesn't reach the net-zero emissions mark pay 1 percent of the value of the contract, which would be used to “to invest directly in making our military infrastructure more resilient.”

— A plan to put up border wall through protected lands: The federal government is looking to replace barriers across 100 miles of the southern border with Mexico in California and Arizona, including through the Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument and the Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge, the Associated Press reports, citing environmental advocates and government documents.

The refuge specifically is meant to provide a designated home for 275 wildlife species. The report follows a move by the Department of Homeland Security to waive numerous laws in order to build more border wall. “The Trump administration just ignored bedrock environmental and public health laws to plow a disastrous border wall through protected, spectacular wildlands,” the Center for Biological Diversity’s Laiken Jordahl told the AP.

— ""So you think we can innovate our way out of this?"" The House Ways and Means Committee Wednesday hearing on climate change was the first to focus on the issue in a dozen years, the Washington Examiner reports, and lawmakers discussed various topics, including a carbon tax and clean energy.

During the hearing, Republican members also acknowledged there’s been a shift in rhetoric on the issue from their party. “We have gone from full of claims of [being] climate deniers to now we seem to be progress deniers,” Rep. Kevin Brady (R-Tex.) said, suggesting Democrats haven’t appreciated the shift. “We are making progress. Is it enough? Absolutely not. But we can learn from what’s brought us that progress to solve the challenge ahead of us, which is real.”

But: Rep. Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.) meanwhile, dismissed what he called “happy talk” about progress. “There was no acknowledgment about the terrible [climate change] impacts that are getting worse, and the Trump administration's concerted effort to make it even worse. So you think we can innovate our way out of this? We are on a path that is going to be very grim.”

— New York's pipeline predicament: Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) has until Thursday to decide whether to approve a proposed pipeline that would connect natural gas fields in Pennsylvania to New Jersey and New York. The pipeline has been at the center of debate about the state’s energy future, the New York Times reports.

Environmental advocates are worried about the impact on vulnerable ecosystems and establishing a reliance on fossil fuels as some New Yorkers look toward pushing renewable energy sources. “While the pipeline has not attracted anywhere near the attention of the Keystone XL or Dakota Access pipelines in the Great Plains region, which carry oil, supporters and opponents alike said the gas project could be similarly consequential,” the Times reports.

— PG&E’s wildfire woes: California state fire officials have concluded that Pacific Gas & Electric Co. equipment is to blame for the devastating Camp Fire that killed 85 people in November and was the most destructive wildfire in the state’s history. According to investigators with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, the deadly blaze was sparked by electrical transmission lines controlled by the state’s largest utility and located in the community of Pulga, The Post’s Michael Brice-Saddler reports. In February, the company acknowledged it is “probable that its equipment will be determined to be an ignition point of the 2018 Camp fire.”

— An “an invisible cost” to deadly fires: Fire officials spoke to state lawmakers at a joint California Senate and Assembly hearing this week about the toll frequent deadly fires are having on firefighters and their mental health, as one fire captain from Sacramento called it an “invisible cost that’s rarely discussed.”

In California alone, the Firefighter Behavioral Health Alliance reports there have been 46 firefighter and emergency medical worker suicides in the past five years. Across the country, there have been 33 firefighter and emergency medical personnel suicides this year, E&E News reports. “At the hearing, fire officials said they needed more mental health support for emergency workers, both in the field during events and after the fires. They also said they needed more fire suppression personnel overall.”

— A trade-off for fast-growing trees: Although certain types of plants and trees could experience accelerated growth as a result of higher temperatures and carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere, a new study suggests those same trees could die faster, too. That means even as some experts say faster-growing trees could help combat global warming by drawing carbon in and storing the gas at higher rates, a new study in Nature Communications found “faster-growing trees also die younger, meaning the carbon they store goes back into the atmosphere more quickly,” E&E News reports.

Rod Rosenstein’s replacement has officially been confirmed by the Senate,https://www.vox.com,['May'],05-16-2019,2019,5,https://www.vox.com/2019/5/16/18626754/jeffrey-rosen-bill-barr-confirmation-deputy-attorney-general-mueller-report,"Jeffrey Rosen, an attorney who’s never served at the Department of Justice or as a prosecutor, just became Attorney General William Barr’s second-in-command.

Rosen was most recently deputy secretary at the Transportation Department, and while he’s not the first to take on this role with little DOJ background, he was widely panned by Democrats for his inexperience at the agency. Given solid backing from Republicans, however, he was confirmed by the Senate 52-45 in a vote on Thursday.

Rosen joins the DOJ as deputy attorney general at a time of immense change. Rod Rosenstein vacated the role in early May, and special counsel Robert Mueller is set to leave the agency shortly as well, now that his probe into Russian election interference is complete.

Mueller’s review may be over, but the fallout from it is just beginning — and that will likely be a key issue Rosen will have to deal with in this role, which also includes overseeing the day-to-day operations of “107,000 employees and an annual budget of approximately $28 billion,” according to a Politico report by former DOJ career attorney Julie Rodin Zebrak.

Already, Democrats have pushed for an unredacted version of the report and testimony from Mueller himself, while Republicans are urging the DOJ to conduct other reviews about bias against the Trump campaign. Rosen’s predecessor, Rosenstein, was ultimately pivotal to ensuring that the Mueller investigation was able to continue.

Rosen will report directly to Barr, someone he worked alongside previously at the law firm Kirkland & Ellis. Barr previously offered a hearty endorsement of Rosen’s nomination, praising his “more than 35 years’ experience litigating complex matters in state and federal courts across the country” earlier this year.

Who is Jeffrey Rosen?

Rosen has split his more than three-decade career between jobs in the government and stints at Kirkland & Ellis. According to his biography on the Transportation Department website, Rosen served as general counsel for the White House Office of Management and Budget and the Transportation Department between 2003 and 2009, under President George W. Bush. He had also worked at Kirkland & Ellis for almost three decades, including for clients like General Motors and Hyundai.

Rosen was confirmed for the deputy transportation secretary position 56-42 in May 2017, with predominantly Republican support.

According to Politico, Democrats’ primary concerns about his appointment to that role centered on Rosen’s approach to environmental policy. And some of these certainly proved warranted: While at the Transportation Department, Rosen has undone prior regulations established during President Barack Obama’s administration and helped roll back rules on fuel efficiency.

Rosen, during his April confirmation hearing, was also pressed on how he would handle the job at the Justice Department, including questions about his stance on releasing the full Mueller report. Rosen wouldn’t commit to sharing the entire report, though he did say he would support federal investigations that may be generated from it to continue. “If I’m confirmed, I would expect in all criminal investigations and prosecutorial matters that they proceed on the facts and the law,” he said.

Additionally, Rosen emphasized that he’d push back on potential political pressure from the White House around Justice Department activities, when needed. “If the appropriate answer is to say no to somebody, then I will say no,” he noted.

The deputy attorney general is responsible for the day-to-day functions of the agency

The deputy attorney general’s job, which has historically been a relatively low-profile one, also includes an expansive set of responsibilities, Rodin Zebrak writes. And because Rosen hasn’t worked at the Justice Department before, a lot of these could prove entirely new to him:

The deputy attorney general oversees day-to-day operations and policies of the entire DOJ, a sprawling institution of more than 107,000 employees and an annual budget of approximately $28 billion. The department includes the litigating divisions such as the Civil Rights Division, Criminal Division, Antitrust Division, National Security Division, Civil Division, and the Environmental and Natural Resources Division. The deputy supervises all 93 United States attorneys and their work around the country, as well as immigration judges. DOJ also includes the FBI, Drug Enforcement Administration, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, United States Marshals Service and Bureau of Prisons. For someone completely new to DOJ, managing all that will require a steep learning curve.

Rosen was confronted with this question at his confirmation hearing, during which he emphasized his experience overseeing more than 55,000 employees at DOT and his lengthy legal career.

He’ll be joining the agency at a time of major scrutiny related to the Mueller investigation, blowback to Trump’s immigration policies, and looming questions about antitrust enforcement. Now that he’s been confirmed, he’ll have the opportunity to prove that he can handle it."
Another Rule Trump Could Break: Primary Challengers Doom Incumbent Presidents,https://www.npr.org,['Jessica Taylor'],05-16-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/16/722230017/another-rule-trump-could-break-primary-challengers-doom-incumbent-presidents,"Another Rule Trump Could Break: Primary Challengers Doom Incumbent Presidents

Enlarge this image toggle caption Scott Eisen/Getty Images Scott Eisen/Getty Images

An incumbent president with a middling approval rating and mounting controversies is usually an easy draw for primary challengers.

Look to Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter and George H.W. Bush. All three presidents survived intraparty battles, but those primary fights left their reelection campaigns so hobbled — exposing longstanding weaknesses with their bases — that each went on to lose out on four more years in the White House.

But even if a viable GOP challenger to President Trump does emerge, it's unlikely he or she could make much headway or have a lasting impact on the president's chances in November. That's because Trump's firm grasp on the Republican Party could help him emerge not only victorious, but relatively unscathed by a primary challenge.

Political polarization is higher than ever, according to Princeton University professor of history and public affairs Julian Zelizer. And the slice of the electorate that likes Trump isn't budging, no matter what the president may say or do. Meanwhile, those who don't like him are resolute in their disdain, leaving a smaller block of persuadable voters than there were in previous elections.

""Trump has essentially remade the Republican Party in his image,"" said Zelizer. ""So many people aren't going to believe anything that the Mueller report says, and they take whatever Trump says as gospel. That just to me is another stumbling block that you probably didn't have in a post-Watergate era.""

In 1976, President Gerald Ford was already in a debilitated position. The Republican was an incumbent that had never been elected president (or even vice president) and was uniquely challenged in the aftermath of the Watergate scandal, President Richard Nixon's resignation and his own subsequent controversial pardon of Nixon. So it's not surprising former California Gov. Ronald Reagan mounted a near-upset bid against him.

During the primaries, momentum swung back and forth between the two GOP candidates. The first ballot of voting at the 1976 Republican National Convention was razor-thin: 1,187 delegates for Ford and 1,070 for Reagan, just a 117 vote difference. But Ford did narrowly clear the 1,130 delegates needed to secure the nomination. Such a fractious ending would prove prescient months later as he lost to former Georgia Gov. Jimmy Carter, netting 240 electoral votes to the Democrat's 297.

Four years later amid a sagging economy and the hostage crisis in Iran, Carter himself would be hamstrung as he sought a second term. Massachusetts Sen. Edward Kennedy, whose brothers had both sought the presidency, saw an opening. But despite strong numbers at the outset of the primary, Kennedy would peter out as his personal scandals surfaced and Carter simply out-organized him. Their fight would continue through 1980 Democratic convention though, where Kennedy, having finished with just over a third of the primary votes, admitted he couldn't win.

The famous not-really-a-concession speech Kennedy gave at the New York City convention laid out his own idealistic vision rather than trying to boost Carter.

""For me, a few hours ago, this campaign came to an end,"" the political scion told the crowd. ""For all those whose cares have been our concern, the work goes on. The cause endures. The hope still lives. And the dream shall never die.""

As a result, it was Kennedy who got the raucous applause and seemed like the hero of the 1980 DNC, not the incumbent president who had actually won the nomination. Facing a renewed Reagan in the general election, Carter was walloped, winning just 49 electoral votes to the Republican's 489.

Perhaps it's President George H.W. Bush's re-election battle that best foreshadowed the era of Trump. The former vice president and CIA director saw sky high approval numbers in the aftermath of the Gulf War. But the economy would slow, giving conservative commentator Pat Buchanan a divide he could exploit by waging a bid based on fighting the ""culture wars.""

Buchanan would falter and end up taking less than a quarter of the primary vote away from Bush, and billionaire Ross Perot running as an independent in the general election also deeply harmed the incumbent's chances. But there was an anti-establishment vein within the GOP Buchanan may have helped awaken. It might have taken decades to fully manifest, but many saw Trump as the eventual embodiment of what Buchanan helped to shape.

History doesn't always repeat itself

Trump seems to have a stronghold on his party that no candidate can shake. As Barbara Perry, director of presidential studies at the University of Virginia's Miller Center put it, Trump has simply proven, time and time again, ""that all previous rules do not apply.""

""When we look back at the lessons of history, they may repeat themselves, but they haven't so far,"" Perry said. ""He may get a challenge by either a strong gadfly or a strong personality or a strong presence in the party,"" just as Ronald Reagan was to Ford in 1976 and Ted Kennedy was to Carter in 1980. ""But I don't see that person on the horizon.""

There are some possible challengers emerging to Trump, but Perry is right that less than nine months before the nominating process begins, no Republican has stood out as a formidable alternative.

Former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld is the only major announced candidate so far after running for vice president on the Libertarian Party ticket in 2016 along with former New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson. But Weld certainly doesn't seem to have the heft of past White House challengers that could irrevocably damage a sitting president.

Some of the potential heavyweights who are still mulling bids include former Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who also sought the GOP nomination last time, and popular centrist Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, who's already made some early state moves.

Frequent Trump agitators like former Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake and former Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker were also floated early on. Flake has since ruled out a 2020 run, but the recently retired Corker still sounds open, saying recently that Trump ""purposely seeks to divide"" the American people and someone should challenge him.

""Philosophically, you could look at it and say that it would be a good thing for our country should that occur,"" Corker said during the TIME 100 Summit last month. ""If you had a real primary, where you had someone that was really being listened to, and of substance, things that we were talking about — and I could go through a list of them — they would actually be debated in a real way.""

There might once have been other names on that list — prominent 2016 doubters like South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham or former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley. Despite their blistering criticism almost four years ago toward the polarizing reality TV show host and businessman, they too have come around and been loyal allies of Trump in the case of Graham, or a onetime part of his administration, with Haley serving as UN ambassador until last year.

The president's poll numbers reflect the waning influence of the once vocal critics may have had within the party — winning over converts, even if he may have polarized more independent voters.

The most recent NBC News/Wall Street Journal survey shows a staggering 90 percent of Republicans approve of the job Trump has done, leaving little room for a challenger to grab a foothold. And for now, there's no GOP option who seems like they could truly compete with Trump, given the unprecedented way he has tried to centralize the Republican National Committee around his re-election bid and ward off a primary challenge.

Tribalism is a force that Corker also lamented, saying at the TIME event that Trump ""has an unusually visceral contact with the Republican base as it's made up today... That's in some ways where the electorate is today, where it has become very tribal in nature."""
"Education Department hinders policing of student loans, consumer agency says",https://www.politico.com,['Michael Stratford'],05-16-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/16/student-loans-education-department-1447485,"Kathy Kraninger, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau director, made the disclosure in a letter to Democratic senators released on Thursday. | J. Scott Applewhite/AP Photo education Education Department hinders policing of student loans, consumer agency says

The head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau says the Education Department is impeding access to information that regulators need to oversee the nation’s largest student loan servicing companies.

Kathy Kraninger, the CFPB director, made the disclosure in a letter to Democratic senators released on Thursday by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who has accused the bureau of abandoning its responsibility to police companies that collect payments from student loan borrowers.

Story Continued Below

Kraninger said that “student loan servicers have declined to produce information requested by the Bureau for supervisory examinations” related to federal student loans, based on a December 2017 directive from the Education Department. The department is headed by Education Secretary Betsy DeVos.

The CFPB “has pursued options that would have permitted it to obtain” the information it needs to supervise student loan servicers, Kraninger said in the letter, but she didn’t say whether those options had been successful. The letter was first reported by NPR.

Warren, a 2020 presidential candidate, as well as Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) and other Senate Democrats called Kraninger’s disclosure “disturbing news” in a letter to student loan servicers.

The senators said the Education Department had “removed a key weapon from CFPB's arsenal to fight illegal behavior and mistreatment of borrowers by student loan servicers.” They also expressed concern that “federal student loan servicers, who are paid by the federal government, are ignoring federal regulators' request for information.”

The CFPB has the authority to supervise large student loan servicing companies, regardless of whether they collect private student loans or federal student loans. That has long created tension between the Education Department and the CFPB over student loans.

The Education Department policy cited by Kraninger, first reported by POLITICO last year, orders federal student loan servicers to refuse requests for information from third parties like state attorneys general or the CFPB. The policy says those requests must instead be funneled through Education Department officials in order to comply with federal privacy laws.

The policy has been at the center of ongoing disputes between DeVos and state attorneys general seeking to investigate or take legal action against student loan servicers. DeVos has argued that her agency provides adequate oversight over the companies, rejecting efforts by state regulators to police the industry.

Liz Hill, an Education Department spokesperson, said in a statement that the agency “cooperates fully with federal law enforcement officials on matters related to the federal student aid programs.”

Hill said the policy prohibiting student loan servicers from responding directly to information requests by the CFPB or other regulators is about protecting the privacy of loan borrowers. Such requests for information “should be made to the Department, where they will be evaluated for compliance with the Privacy Act,” she said.

The Education Department has previously refused to say how many of those information requests it receives — and whether or not it has granted them. Senate appropriators last year directed the department to publicly disclose those decisions, but the department has declined to do so.

Court records reviewed by POLITICO last year showed that the Education Department had also turned down requests for student loan records made directly by state attorneys general.

The department last year also refused a request for information by the CFPB for information about Navient in connection with CFPB's massive lawsuit against the student loan servicer.

The CFPB said at the time that the Education Department was refusing to give permission for Navient to turn over a trove of documents relating to how the company collects and manages the payments of federal student loan borrowers.

A federal judge ultimately sided with the CFPB in the dispute. He ruled that Navient “cannot assert that the records may ultimately belong to the Department of Education or use the Privacy Act to shield the requested borrower documents” from the CFPB’s requests.

China sells most US Treasurys since October '16,https://www.foxbusiness.com,[],,,,https://www.foxbusiness.com/financials/china-sells-us-treasurys,"China sold the most U.S. Treasuries in almost 2-1/2 years in March amid uncertainty about a trade deal between Beijing and Washington, data from the U.S. Treasury Department released on Wednesday showed.

Continue Reading Below

Since last week after a dismal 10-year Treasury auction, there has been renewed speculation whether China may sell its U.S. debt in retaliation for increased tariffs on $200 billion of its exports to the United States.

The latest data on China's U.S. bond holding were collected before a sudden breakdown in trade talks between the world's two biggest economic powers 1-1/2 weeks ago and prior to the U.S. duty hike on Chinese goods, which went into effect on Friday.

China sold $20.45 billion in Treasuries in March, the most since October 2016, following $1.08 billion in purchases the month before.

China's stake in Treasuries fell for the first time in four months to $1.121 trillion in March, which was the lowest since May 2017 when it was $1.102 trillion. It was $1.131 trillion in February, the data showed.

""The decline this month brings China essentially flat to where they were in February, erasing the increases from December through February,"" Jefferies LLC's senior money market economist Tom Simons wrote in a research note.

Despite the drop in Treasuries holdings, the world's second-largest economy remained the largest U.S. creditor.

On the other hand, Japan raised its Treasuries holdings to $1.078 trillion, the highest since November 2017, from $1.072 trillion in February.

However, another set of Treasury data showed Japan sold $11.07 billion in U.S. government debt in March, the most for U.S.'s No. 2 foreign creditor, since February 2018.

Meanwhile, foreigners resumed sales of Treasuries in March as U.S. 10-year yields fell to 15-month lows after the Federal Reserve signaled it would not raise interest rates in 2019, according to the latest Treasury data.

They sold $12.53 billion in U.S. government debt in March after buying $19.91 billion the month before.

""Private investors have been big buyers of Treasuries since the beginning of the second half of 2018, but foreign official institutions have been inconsistent,"" Simons said.

Official overseas selling of Treasuries coincided with a dollar rally in March spurred by safe-haven bids for the greenback amid worries about the global economy, trade tension and uncertainty around Brexit.

Central banks of export-oriented countries often sell their Treasury holdings to defend their currencies from a sharp appreciation of the greenback.

Overseas accounts also sold stocks for 11 straight months, reducing their equity stakes by $23.64 billion in March.

On the other hand, they bought $4.74 billion in agency securities and $1.11 billion of corporate bonds.

OUTFLOW PERSISTS

The latest data showed a net outflow from the United States totaling $8.1 billion in March, slower than the revised $21.5 billion in February.

Foreign central banks and other government entities accelerated their reduction of U.S. assets, selling $21.7 billion in March versus a revised $10.1 billion the month before.

The official foreign sales in March were offset by net purchases by private overseas investors which acquired $13.6 billion in U.S. assets after a revised $11.4 billion in sales in February."
"Bill Nelson claimed, without evidence, that Russia meddled in Florida's 2018 midterms. Journalists say he has been vindicated",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-16-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/bill-nelson-claimed-without-evidence-that-russia-meddled-in-floridas-2018-midterms-journalists-say-he-has-been-vindicated,"There has been no greater tool than Twitter for exposing the general ignorance and slavish devotion to groupthink from which so many members of the press suffer.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis revealed this week that Russian operatives had successfully hacked voter databases in the Sunshine State during the 2016 presidential election.

""I recently met with the FBI concerning the election issue mentioned in [special counsel Robert Mueller’s report on the Russia investigation],"" DeSantis said. ""Two Florida counties experienced intrusion into the supervisor of election networks. There was no manipulation.""

From these remarks, journalists and pundits claimed vindication on behalf of failed Democratic Senate candidate Bill Nelson, who had claimed, without evidence, that the Russians meddled in Florida’s 2018 midterm elections. There still is no proof to bear out Nelson’s claim (none that he has provided anyway). But you would think otherwise from watching how certain reporters and political commentators responded this week to DeSantis’ remarks.

“Bill Nelson wasn't making things up when he said Russians hacked Florida election systems,” tweeted Huffington Post reporter Sam Levin.

The Daily Beast’s Sam Stein added, “Bill Nelson got hosed.”

Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., “still suggests Bill Nelson had it wrong when he said during 2018 campaign that Florida voting systems had been hacked,” NPR’s Greg Allen tweeted Thursday. “That follows his briefing by FBI that two Florida counties had indeed been hacked.

“How can FL and others, remedy security gaps, if we don’t know what the hell happened? Did it change voting results? Did it change any election results? Has anyone apologized to Bill Nelson?” asked CNN’s commentator Ana Navarro-Cardenas.

There are additional examples, including MSNBC's Chris Hayes, CNN’s Keith Boykin, New York magazine’s Jonathan Chait, etc., of members of the news media amplifying the notion that DeSantis’ revelation this week somehow vindicates Nelson.

To be clear, Florida's Republican governor confirmed there was meddling in the 2016 election — the presidential election. Nelson had alleged, without evidence, that the Russians interfered in the 2018 elections. Nelson said specifically on Aug. 7, 2018, that “the Russians are in Florida’s records.”

The Tampa Bay Times’ Kirby Wilson explicitly asked the Democratic candidate a day later: “Do you mean right now, or were you referring to 2016?”

Nelson replied: “Right now.”

He also said during the election, “It would be foolish to think that the Russians are not continuing to do what they did in Florida in 2016.”

Nelson was criticized at the time not for saying the Russians meddled in 2016 — which was already widely reported on and generally accepted at the time — but for claiming, without evidence, they were interfering in the 2018 elections as well.

The Washington Free Beacon’s Alex Griswold, who first flagged journalists’ and pundits’ pro-Nelson defenses this week, also makes a good point: “I suppose it's possible Nelson might be vindicated by future disclosures, but right now the victory lap is premature. In any case, if Nelson's claim is ever vindicated, that means he's only guilty of leaking classified information to sway an election, so … good for him I guess?”

How reporters and political commentators concluded that this week's revelations vindicate what Nelson claimed about the 2018 midterm elections is anyone’s guess. It probably has something to do with a failure to read past the headlines."

The State Department has ordered all ""non-emergency"" U.S. government employees to leave Iraq right away.

The travel advisory specifically orders the departure of employees at the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad and consulate in Irbil (sometimes spelled Erbil), noting that ""normal visa services will be temporarily suspended at both posts.""

Employees were urged to depart the country by commercial transportation as soon as possible and avoid U.S. facilities within Iraq.

It was not immediately clear what led to the order on Wednesday. The advisory instructs U.S. citizens not to travel to Iraq because of high risks of terrorism, kidnapping and armed conflict.

The State Department warns that ""the U.S. government's ability to provide routine and emergency services to U.S. citizens in Iraq is extremely limited.""

The New York Times reported this week that sources said Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan presented an updated military plan last week — a plan that envisioned sending up to 120,000 troops to the Middle East in case of a move by Iran. It's not evident that President Trump has a desire to send so many U.S. troops to the region. Sources told the Times that the plan was ordered by those in line with national security adviser John Bolton, who is known for a hawkish stance toward Iran."

“We gave them a reasonable period of time to produce them and ask them to do so as a demonstration of good faith, and an initial part of what would be a rolling production of documents, the long and the short of it is the deadline came and went without the production of a single document, raising profound questions about whether the department has any intention to honor its legal obligations,” Schiff said.

“So we are reluctantly scheduling a committee business meeting for next week, where we plan to take up an enforcement action,” Schiff said.

The Democratic chairman issued a subpoena for Mueller’s unredacted report, underlying evidence, and the counterintelligence and foreign intelligence materials generated in the course of the Russia investigation last week. Schiff set a 3 p.m. deadline Wednesday for the Justice Department to comply.

A spokesman for the Justice Department did not immediately return a request for comment on Schiff’s remarks.

The chairman said the committee will defer to the House counsel to decide what their best course of action is to enforce the subpoena, a matter being examined across multiple House committees grappling with how to compel the White House to cooperate with Democrats’ multiple oversight investigations.

“We will continue to urge the Department to render that unnecessary but if they don't demonstrate some good faith, we will be forced to compel them to honor their legal commitments,” Schiff said.

Schiff noted that despite asking for a “narrow” set of documents, the Justice Department’s response to their request was “largely unresponsive,” though the chairman declined to share their back-and-forth communication.

The House Judiciary Committee has similarly subpoenaed for Mueller’s full, unredacted report and underlying evidence. The Justice Department has resisted the panel’s requests, saying that turning over Mueller’s full report -- including grand jury material -- would amount to violating the law and compromising ongoing investigations.

The Judiciary panel voted to hold Barr in contempt last week for failing to comply with the subpoena. The resolution has not yet reached the floor for a vote by the full House.

Schiff has noted that his panel’s request for the files is distinct from that of the Judiciary Committee, arguing his committee is entitled to the foreign and counterintelligence information as a result of its oversight of the intelligence community.

Schiff, who issued the subpoena last Wednesday, accused the Justice Department of failing to negotiate with the committee or comply with its bipartisan requests for Mueller’s report and other files over the past several weeks.

Former DHS officials ousted over push back on Trump administration's plan to arrest thousands of migrants,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Ryan Gaydos', 'Ryan Gaydos Is An Editor For Fox News. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/former-dhs-officials-ousted-over-push-back-on-trump-administrations-plan-to-arrest-thousands-of-migrants,"Former Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and a top immigration official challenged a previously secret White House plan to arrest thousands of migrant parents and children in nearly a dozen U.S. cities, Fox News confirmed Monday.

The Trump administration wanted to target migrant families that had crossed into the U.S. from Mexico in attempt to show that the U.S. wasn't going to back down on its border stance by detaining and deporting illegal immigrant families, The Washington Post first reported, citing several current and former Homeland Security officials.

NEW TRUMP WH POLICY LETS DEPUTIES DETAIN IMMIGRANTS ON BEHALF OF ICE, SUBVERTING 'SANCTUARY' LAWS

The operation included fast-tracking immigration court cases and allowing the U.S. to deport those who failed to show up in their hearings as well as coordinating raids against parents with children in several cities, including New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and several other major metropolitan areas, Fox News confirmed.

Nielsen and top immigration official Ronald Vitiello pushed back on the administration’s plan, citing lack of preparation, public outrage and worries that the operation could use border resources. Stephen Miller and ICE Deputy Director Matthew Albence were supportive of the plan arguing that such an operation could deter migrants from crossing into the U.S., according to The Washington Post.

Nielsen and Vitello’s were concerned over the operation and logistics over the plan and not the ethical reasons behind it, according to the newspaper. Nielsen also worried that targeting parents and children might detract from the White House’s goal of going after so-called “criminal aliens.”

“There was concern that it was being hastily put together, would be ineffective and might actually backfire by misdirecting resources away from critical border emergency response operations,” a Homeland Security official told The Washington Post.

Nielsen and Vitello’s push back was reportedly part of the reason why Trump pushed both officials out of the administration.

Neither Homeland Security nor the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement have commented on the report. Miller, through a White House spokesman, declined comment to The Post.

Nielsen left her position after only 16 months on the job. The Associated Press, citing two sources, reported that Nielsen had been frustrated with the difficulty of getting other departments to help deal with the growing number of families crossing the southwestern border.

The commerce ban does not prohibit U.S. telecom companies from purchasing Huawei gear, but instead bans Huawei from sourcing its supply chain components from U.S. companies. The move will hamper Huawei’s ability to conduct business internationally because of its reliance on U.S. companies for components for its gear, according to a Reuters report citing unnamed U.S. officials.

The move comes one day after U.S. president Donald Trump declared a national emergency in relation to telecom equipment, claiming that “foreign adversaries are increasingly creating and exploiting vulnerabilities in information and communications technology and services.” Trump’s executive order prohibits U.S. companies from sourcing telecom gear from companies that pose a national security risk, but does not name Huawei nor China as specific threats.

RELATED: Trump to ban U.S. carriers from using network gear posing security risk: Reuters

Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said the ban is the result of President Trump’s request that the department to be “vigilant in its protection of national security activities.”

“This will prevent American technology from being used by foreign-owned entities in ways that potentially undermine U.S. national security or foreign policy interests,” Ross said in a statement.

In a statement, Huawei argued the ban would hurt American efforts to roll out 5G networks. “Restricting Huawei from doing business in the U.S. will not make the U.S. more secure or stronger; instead, this will only serve to limit the U.S. to inferior. yet more expensive alternatives, leaving the U.S. lagging behind in 5G deployment, and eventually harming the interests of U.S. companies and consumers,” the company said. “Unreasonable restrictions will infringe upon Huawei's rights and raise other serious legal issues.”

“We are ready and willing to engage with the U.S. government and come up with effective measures to ensure product security,” Huawei said.

The Commerce department made a similar move in 2016 against China-based telecom equipment maker ZTE, over allegations that ZTE was breaking U.S. sanctions. The ban had a devastating effect on ZTE’s business, causing the company to suspend its operations, as it was unable to source components from U.S. companies. Last year, ZTE reached an agreement with the U.S, government to pay over $1 billion in fines to have the ban suspended."
State Department's red flag on Steele went to a senior FBI man well before FISA warrant,https://thehill.com,[],05-14-2019,2019,5,https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/443710-state-departments-red-flag-on-steele-went-to-a-senior-fbi-man-well-before,"In all Washington investigations, the essential questions become who knew it and when did they know it.

In the case of FBI informant Christopher Steele and the credibility of his now-disproven Russia collusion allegations against Donald Trump Donald John TrumpNapolitano claims Trump violated separation of powers 3 times in last week Work on surprise medical bills goes into overdrive Trump pardons media tycoon, former GOP leader of California State Assembly MORE, we have some important clarity: Government officials confirm that an October 2016 email revealing that Steele met with State Department officials — a breach of protocol for an informant if it was unauthorized — was sent to an FBI counterintelligence supervisor.

ADVERTISEMENT

Multiple sources confirm to me that the recipient of the State Department email was Special Agent Stephen Laycock, then the FBI’s section chief for Eurasian counterintelligence and now one of the bureau’s top executives as the assistant director for intelligence under Director Christopher Wray.

The email to Laycock from Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Kathleen Kavalec arrived eight days before the FBI swore to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court that it had no derogatory information on Steele and used his anti-Trump dossier to secure a secret surveillance warrant to investigate Trump’s possible ties to Moscow.

Officials tell me that Laycock immediately forwarded the information he received about Steele on Oct. 13, 2016, to the FBI team leading the Trump-Russia investigation, headed by then-fellow Special Agent Peter Strzok.

Laycock was the normal point of contact for Kavalec on Eurasian counterintelligence matters, and he simply acted as a conduit to get the information to his colleagues supervising the Russia probe, the officials added.

The officials declined to say what the FBI did with the information about Steele after it reached Strzok’s team, or what the email specifically revealed. A publicly disclosed version of the email has been heavily redacted in the name of national security.

While much remains to be answered, the email exchange means FBI supervisors knew Steele had contact with State and had reason to inquire what he was saying before they sought the warrant. If they had inquired, agents would have learned Steele had admitted to Kavalec he had been leaking to the news media, had a political deadline of Election Day to get his information public and had provided demonstrably false intelligence in one case, as I reported last week.

Current and former FBI officials told me it would be a red flag for an FBI informant on a sensitive counterintelligence case such as Russia to go talking about his evidence with another federal agency without authorization.

Kevin Brock, the former FBI assistant director for intelligence, said the State Department’s email in October 2016 ordinarily should have triggered the FBI to reevaluate Steele as a source.

“This is quite important,” Brock said. “Under normal circumstances, when you get information about the conduct of your source that gives rise to questions about their reliability or truthfulness, you usually go back and reevaluate their dependability and credibility.

“It doesn’t always mean immediate discontinuation of the source. But there are policy requirements that you exercise some form of prudence, and conduct further vetting to determine whether this source can be utilized going forward. This is particularly true if the source’s information is being used in an affidavit or some other legal process.”

FBI confidential sources such as Steele sign a confidentiality agreement and undergo a training session on the do's and don’ts of informing, an event known in intelligence parlance as an “admonishment.” FBI records show Steele underwent “admonishment” training and signed an acknowledgement on Feb. 2, 2016.

The FBI fired Steele as an informant on Nov. 1, 2016, claiming he was caught leaking to the news media. But by that time Steele’s intelligence already had been used as the main evidence to secure a Federal Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrant against the Trump campaign on Oct. 21, 2016.

The public version of Kavalec's email blacked out Laycock’s name as the recipient and listed an attachment file when it was delivered last month to the conservative group Citizens United under an open records request. The blacked-out version contained only a single visible sentence, in which Kavalec wrote the FBI supervisor: “You may already have this information but wanted to pass it on just in case.”

Officials familiar with Kavalec’s email would only describe the contents as having to do with something Steele told the State Department during an Oct. 11, 2016, visit. They said the attachment was not a copy of Steele’s now-infamous dossier or a complete set of Kavalec’s typed notes from her conversation with the informant. Rather, they say, it was information Steele shared with Kavalec that she felt needed to be transmitted to the bureau.

The officials also declined to address another mystery that has caught congressional investigators’ attention: Kavalec had two exchanges with FBI officials about Steele approximately two weeks before her meeting. The email contacts on Sept. 29-30, 2016, have been redacted, except for a single phrase “Thank you Kathy.” Congressional investigators want to know if the earlier exchange resulted in Kavalec learning in advance of Steele’s work for the FBI, or was a further tipoff to the FBI of Steele’s intention to visit State, a department where he had offered pro bono information in the past.

An FBI spokeswoman declined comment. Laycock did not respond to phone and email requests for comment. State officials declined to discuss the documents.

Republican House and Senate investigators who spent two years reviewing the Russia case say they were not provided the details of Kavalec’s contact with Steele or told about the existence of her handwritten and typed notes.

Lawmakers believe the new memos provide additional evidence Steele was unsuitable to be an informant before his dossier was used to justify a FISA warrant.

Their concern is heightened by the fact that Steele was working simultaneously as an FBI informant and as a paid researcher for Fusion GPS, the firm hired by Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonFrustrated GOP senators want answers from Trump on Iran Progressive group targets Susan Collins over Trump judicial pick Poll: Biden leads Trump by double digits in Pennsylvania MORE’s presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee (DNC) to find Russia dirt on Trump in hopes of defeating him in the election.

Congressional Republicans have said publicly for months that the FBI failed to adequately inform FISA judges that Steele was working for Trump’s rival and had a bias against the GOP nominee, or that his dossier was unverified and contained demonstrably false information.

Defenders of the FBI have countered that there isn’t evidence to prove the bureau knew Steele was leaking to the media or was hired by the Clinton campaign and the DNC until after the FISA warrant was filed.

Exclusive: Trump EPA did not await court ruling to loosen biofuel rules for refiners - documents,https://www.reuters.com,"['Jarrett Renshaw', 'Min Read']",05-16-2019,2019,5,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-epa-biofuels-exclusive/exclusive-trump-epa-did-not-await-court-ruling-to-loosen-biofuel-rules-for-refiners-documents-idUSKCN1SM13Z,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Trump administration made it easier for oil refineries to get waivers from the nation’s biofuel law at least four months before a 2017 court decision it often cites to justify the move to the corn lobby, and the move was motivated by a desire to save the oil industry money, Reuters has learned.

The timing and motivation for the Environmental Protection Agency’s policy change, revealed through court documents and an interview with a former top agency official, have not been previously reported. This reinforces the concerns of the corn industry that the decision to expand the waiver program was made at the EPA’s discretion.

“EPA repeatedly told Congress its hands were tied and blamed the courts. That appears to have been a lie. EPA also said it was following Department of Energy recommendations. We also know that’s bunk. I’m going to get to the bottom of this,” U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley, a Republican from the farm state of Iowa, said in a statement on Thursday.

The waivers, granted to small refineries including those run by oil majors Exxon Mobil, Chevron Corp and billionaire investor Carl Icahn, saved the oil industry hundreds of millions of dollars. The waivers angered the corn lobby which argued they hurt farmers by threatening demand for ethanol.

Whether the EPA’s moves have hurt ethanol demand has been a topic of fierce debate.

The U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard requires refiners to blend biofuels like ethanol into their fuel or buy credits generated by those who do, but smaller refineries can be exempted if they prove compliance would cause them financial harm.

Trump’s EPA granted 35 such waivers for 2017, up sharply from seven in the final year of the Obama administration.

Court documents filed by a biofuels advocacy group show that the EPA changed the policy before May 4, 2017.

On that date, the EPA told a refining company in a letter that “we are changing our approach” to the waiver program by allowing exemptions to refineries even if their operations “are not significantly impaired” by compliance, according to the documents filed by the Advanced Biofuels Association in a challenge of the expanded waiver program.

That puts the policy shift at least four months ahead of an August 2017 U.S. Court of Appeals ruling that found the agency was using too strict a standard when it denied Utah-based Sinclair Oil an exemption. The EPA subsequently withdrew its defense on a similar court case, and lost a third.

Those cases are often cited by EPA officials and refining industry representatives defending the expanded waiver program.

“The courts have clearly told us we have to follow the law, and that’s what we are going to do,” EPA administrator Andrew Wheeler said in April media interview when pressed about the expansion.

Mandy Gunasekara, who retired as principal deputy assistant administrator at the EPA’s Office of Air and Radiation this year, said the EPA under then-administrator Scott Pruitt had decided to “reinstate” the small refinery waiver program to help an industry that felt ignored by Obama.

She said Pruitt also believed loosening the standards could help lower the cost of compliance credits, known as RINS, which could help the entire industry as opposed to just smaller refiners.

“Certainly, one of the goals was to put downward pressure on the price of RINs,” she told Reuters in an interview.

She said the Sinclair case did not influence the changes to the waiver program. “When I saw the Sinclar decision come down, I saw it as a vindication of our changes,” she said.

EPA spokesman Michael Abboud did not respond to questions about whether the agency still believes the small refinery program should be used to help manage RIN prices. He maintained that EPA has been consistent in its justification for the expansion of the waiver program.

“The premise of this story is wrong,” he said, adding that the waiver program has “been subject to appropriations language and court opinions prior to and during the Trump Administration.”

Expansion of waivers drove down RIN prices to multi-year lows last year. This helped refiners like Valero Energy Corp and PBF Energy Inc that had been purchasing them, along with CVR Energy Inc, owned by Icahn.

Icahn came under federal investigation after CVR was seen shorting the credit market in 2017 while he advocated for financial relief from the biofuel program.

Icahn and other merchant refiners had long complained that their profit margins were being squeezed by the law, which is nearly 15 years old. It was intended to help farmers and reduce U.S. reliance on energy imports.

The waiver provision was intended to temporarily exempt smaller refineries so they could invest in biofuel blending equipment."
Homeland Security asks military to build tent cities for migrants near border,https://nypost.com,['May'],05-16-2019,2019,5,https://nypost.com/2019/05/16/homeland-security-asks-military-to-build-tent-cities-for-migrants-near-border/,"The Department of Homeland Security has asked the military to build half a dozen tent cities near the southern border to house some 7,500 migrants, according to a report.

A Defense Department spokesman confirmed to NBC News that DHS made the request, which acting Secretary Patrick Shanahan is expected to sign.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement, not the military, will handle the detention and custodial duties at the six camps, which will likely not be on military bases, according to the report.

In a statement, a Defense Department rep said DHS made the request for assistance on May 9.

“After discussions with DHS on the details of the RFA, DHS has agreed to ask that DOD will loan and erect on-hand DOD tents in support of ICE, and provide contracting support to ICE for wraparound services for which ICE will reimburse DOD,” Maj. Chris Mitchell said.

Meanwhile, President Trump is set to announce his administration’s immigration plan Thursday during a speech in the Rose Garden.

The plan, which has little hope of getting through a divided Congress, was devised by the president’s son-in-law and top adviser Jared Kushner and Stephen Miller, the administration’s most prominent hardliner on immigration reform.

According to a Bloomberg report, the plan includes wall funding — the hot-button issue that prompted a government shutdown this year — without enticements for Democrats like granting legal status to so-called “Dreamers.”

The plan places immigrants’ skills above family ties to the US and overhauls the asylum process, which is meant to ease the crush of migrants coming over the border."

The Fox News host’s comments came Wednesday evening during an interview with Sen. Lindsey Graham. The South Carolina Republican was mum on details regarding Inspector General Michael Horowitz’s work for the Justice Department, but he did say those who “love the rule of law” will be “very upset.”

“We now have two sources that told the FBI and the DOJ, the upper echelon, not the rank and file, I always make the distinction,” Mr. Hannity said. “I am told in both cases that with the [former British spy Christopher Steele] dossier, that [Department of Justice lawyer Bruce] Ohr warned them it was unverified — Hillary paid for it, Steele hated Trump. Also, now, we have the emails before the first application went in. It sounds like a premeditated conspiracy to commit fraud on a FISA court. I’m also hearing: Horowitz is done and it’s devastating.

“I can’t tell you what he found, but I can tell you that if you care about the rule of law you’re going to be very upset about how the DOJ and the FBI behaved themselves during the 2016 election,” he said. “If you hate Trump, you won’t care. If you love the rule of law, you’ll be very upset.”

Mr. Horowitz announced the investigation into alleged FISA abuse in March 2018.

“It upholds many bipartisan positions of this committee and of Congress, and supports important investments to protect our national security, fund our commitments and repair America’s reputation internationally,” she added.

The panel approved the measure in a 29-23 vote along party lines, advancing it to the full House, which is expected to take up the proposal in June.

Trump's budget proposal unveiled in March called for 23 percent cuts to State as well as large cuts to other departments in an attempt to curb debt and shift spending toward defense.

The Appropriations-approved 2020 spending bill also takes aim at several of Trump’s foreign policies, including provisions that would restrict the Trump administration from selling nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia and block withdrawal from the Paris climate accord.

It would boost spending for the state department and related agencies by $885.8 million and $174.2 million for the United States Agency for International Development operations. It also includes $6.3 billion for fighting HIV/AIDS.

During the markup, the committee rejected GOP amendments that would have stripped out provisions supporting the Paris climate accord, withheld certain funds from United Nations peacekeeping forces, and kept abortion-related restrictions in place.

The bill would reverse the “gag rule,” also known as the Mexico City policy, which stops U.S. funds from going to any organization that performs, educates about or advocates abortion.

“The president has made his intentions clear,” Aderholt said. “Right now, if the bill stands at is it is, it could be vetoed and we could go toward a continuing resolution.”

The bill is the fourth of 12 appropriations bills to advance through the full committee, while eight have already passed through subcommittee, with another on the docket for Friday.

The bills are unlikely to become law as they are. Democrats are using their own set of overall spending numbers to guide the spending bills, despite the lack of an agreement with the Senate and White House on new spending caps.

The White House has proposed leaving current legislative caps in place, which would lead to dramatic spending cuts in both defense and nondefense spending.

While Senate appropriators opposed keeping the caps in place, they are waiting for a deal before starting the process of writing and marking up their versions of appropriations bills, which will have to be reconciled with the Democratic House bills.

Trump reportedly favors a yearlong continuing resolution that would keep current spending levels in place."
Cobb veterans welcome new clinic amid uncertainty over VA plans,https://www.ajc.com,[],,,,https://www.ajc.com/news/local/cobb-veterans-welcome-new-clinic-amid-uncertainty-over-plans/hkuHsbc4SyoLMY4GsiceYO/,"The Department of Veterans Affairs celebrated the opening of the first of four new clinics in Cobb County Thursday as the agency prepares to expand and shift services in the county.

The $1.2 million, 9,400-square-foot facility on Roswell Road in east Cobb will offer mainly primary care and is one of several facilities replacing a clinic in Austell, which had been Cobb’s only facility and is now slated to be closed.

Veterans who spoke to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution expressed hope the new facility would improve veteran care, even as some raised concerns over the lack of public transit access to the new clinic and ongoing communication problems with the VA.

They also pointed out that closing the Austell clinic could pose problems for veterans in the southern part of the county who will now have to travel farther to see a doctor.

“I’m so grateful that they are building a new building because Austell is ancient,” said Dan Hydrick, a Vietnam veteran and volunteer with the Cobb Veterans Court. But, he added, most veterans he’s spoken to haven’t been informed of the changes and “Change is always stressful for veterans that are trying to seek treatment.”

That’s especially true of those in treatment for mental health issues, he said. The Roswell clinic will have psychologists but not psychiatrists on staff.

The other clinics in the pipeline will be on Dallas Highway in west Cobb, Herodian Way in Smyrna, and Bells Ferry Road in north Cobb.

In a statement, the VA said its clinic locations were chosen “based on the needs of Veterans through a competitive solicitation process.”

“The VA would be interested in learning of opportunities for improved transportation in Cobb County that would serve our Veterans and support efforts to do so,” it said. “The Austell clinic will not close until the South Cobb County and West Cobb County clinics are fully operational.”

Gregory Kendall, a spokesman for the VA, said the agency had sent letters to affected veterans but “we can always do a better job of communicating.”

The VA is also working to expand telehealth options, officials said.

Robert Smith, 59, an Army veteran of Operation Desert Storm, had his first appointment at the new clinic Thursday. Smith, who lives in south Cobb, said even though it was a longer commute for him, he is willing to travel for better service.

“I like what I see and what I’m feeling,” he said. “They seem like they’re more up to helping a soldier here. Austell, I wasn’t too happy there.”

"Exxon and Energy Department Team Up on Biofuels, Plastics Research",https://www.scientificamerican.com,"['John Fialka E E News', 'About The Author S', 'John Fialka', 'Recent Articles', 'E E News']",,,,https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/exxon-and-energy-department-team-up-on-biofuels-plastics-research/,"Research collaborations for cleaner, more energy-dense biofuels and recyclable plastics are at the heart of a new agreement between Exxon Mobil Corp. and Department of Energy laboratories.

Bill Farris, associate director of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in Golden, Colo., explained that the agreement will give scientists better insights into future energy markets and ways to scale up cleaner forms of energy.

“Exxon has to think about how you scale things up,” Farris said in an interview about Exxon’s commitment to contribute $100 million to research by NREL and 16 other DOE laboratories over the next 10 years. “That’s probably one of the things we’re most excited about: taking things into the marketplace at scale. NREL could never do that alone.”

He said discussions that led to the agreement last week—one of the largest research projects that DOE labs have with a commercial company—started with biofuels and then expanded to a broad array of joint research discussions that are still underway. The labs and Exxon started talking about the agreement in November 2017.

They began with Vijay Swarup, vice president of research and development at Exxon Mobil Research and Engineering Co. “Sparks started to fly, we developed a good relationship,” recalled Farris.

In a statement released last week, Swarup said the research partnership is intended to “explore ways to bring biofuels and carbon capture and [energy] storage to commercial uses across the power generation, transportation, and manufacturing sectors.”

Exxon is the largest publicly traded international oil and gas company, and it has stressed that the agreement with DOE is designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions “on a global basis.”

Biofuels will likely be essential to that effort in the transportation sector, explained Farris, because while research has shown that electric cars can reduce greenhouse gases, the trucking and aircraft industries will require more energy-dense fuels to reduce their emissions. NREL has been experimenting with various biofuels to deliver extra energy, and Exxon has focused on algae-based fuels to fill the gap. But it will likely take more experiments and collaborations to see what technology can be scaled up for global use.

One possibility that’s intriguing researchers is fuel made from captured carbon dioxide emissions. Both NREL and its sister laboratory in West Virginia, DOE’s National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), are working on capturing emissions and putting them to use.

Exxon is interested in that, as well, along with ways to store energy. The use of hydrogen-based fuels as a way to store renewable forms of energy from electricity sources, such as solar and wind power, is another research objective.

“We see renewable energy producing electricity at very, very low costs in the future,” explained Farris, pointing to uses in transportation, buildings, factories and homes.

NREL has smaller research partnerships with other major oil companies, including Royal Dutch Shell PLC, Norway’s Equinor ASA and France’s Total SA. “They’re all trying to figure out what future markets are going to look like. Where Exxon is coming from, for example, the planet is going to have 9 billion people, and the quality of their life depends on that energy, and that energy has to have lower carbon,” added Farris.

One of the questions under scrutiny by oil companies, he said, is what future gas stations will look like. While Exxon hasn’t raised the question yet in its discussions with DOE, “I have to think they’re interested in that,” Farris said.

Major oil companies own a large number of gas stations, and in the future they may be required to supply fuel cell-powered cars with hydrogen to recharge electric cars quickly and to supply biofuels for heavy trucks.

Exxon, Farris noted, has a substantial presence in the chemical industry, and one of its research objectives is plastics that don’t use petroleum feedstocks, or that can be recycled to rid the world of its plastic waste problem, which is mounting annually.

In the near future, dozens of Exxon scientists from Texas and the East Coast will be coming to Golden to work on some of these projects with their counterparts at NREL. “If you can increase the contact time between researchers, we think you get better results,” Farris said.

"Homeland Security to allow border wall to go through national monument, wildlife refuge",https://www.cbsnews.com,[],,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/homeland-security-to-allow-border-wall-to-go-through-national-monument-wildlife-refuge/,"The U.S. government plans on replacing barriers through 100 miles of the southern border in California and Arizona, including through a national monument and a wildlife refuge, according to documents and environmental advocates.

The Department of Homeland Security on Tuesday again waived environmental and dozens of other laws to build more barriers along the U.S.-Mexico border.

Funding will come from the Defense Department following the emergency declaration that President Donald Trump signed this year after Congress refused to approve the amount of border wall funding he requested.

Barriers will go up at Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument, a vast park named after the unique cactus breed that decorates it, and Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge, which is largely a designed wilderness home to 275 wildlife species. The government will also build new roads and lighting in those areas in Arizona.

Environmental advocates who have sued to stop the construction of the wall say this latest plan will be detrimental to the wildlife and habitat in those areas.

""The Trump administration just ignored bedrock environmental and public health laws to plow a disastrous border wall through protected, spectacular wildlands,"" said Laiken Jordahl, who works on border issues at the Center for Biological Diversity.

The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment but has typically not said much about construction plans.

At Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument, row after row of cactuses decorate 516 square miles of land that once saw so much drug smuggling that over half the park was closed to the public. But illegal crossings in that area dropped off significantly in the past several years, and the government in 2015 reopened the entire monument for the first time in 12 years.

While Arizona has seen an increase in border crossers over the last year, most are families who turn themselves in to Border Patrol agents. The number of drugs that agents seize in the state has also dropped significantly.

But the government is moving forward with more border infrastructure.

The waivers the department issued Tuesday are vague in their description of where and how many miles of fencing will be installed. The Center for Biological Diversity says the plans total about 100 miles of southern border in both Arizona and California, near Calexico and Tecate.

In Arizona, construction will focus on four areas of the border and will include the replacement of waist-high fencing meant to stop cars with 18- to 30-foot barriers that will be more efficient at stopping illegal crossings.

The government has already demolished refuge land in the Rio Grande Valley of Texas and construction is set to begin any day. On one section of the Lower Rio Grande Valley National Wildlife Refuge, crews have used heavy construction equipment to destroy a mix of trees, including mesquite, mulberry and hackberry. Those trees protect birds during the ongoing nesting season.

According to plans published last year, the cleared land will be filled in and a concrete wall will be installed, with bollards measuring 18 feet installed on top.

After months of public outcry, Congress forbade U.S. Customs and Border Protection from building in the nearby Santa Ana wildlife refuge or the nonprofit National Butterfly Center. But it didn't stop money from going to wall construction in other refuge lands, nor did it stop the government from building in otherwise exempted land due to the emergency declaration, said Marianna Trevino Wright, the butterfly center's director.

""They're going to have to protect us in every single spending bill going forward, and they have to protect us against the state of emergency,"" Wright said. ""And this administration has made it clear ... that they don't want any exemptions."""
President Trump’s Immigration Vision Would Reshape the Visa System,https://www.usnews.com,[],05-16-2019,2019,5,https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2019-05-16/president-trumps-immigration-vision-would-reshape-the-visa-system,"President Donald Trump pauses while speaking about immigration in the Rose Garden at the White House, Thursday, May 16, 2019, in Washington. The Associated Press

President Donald Trump on Thursday announced an immigration reform proposal that seeks to reshape the legal immigration system and enhance border security but does not address immigrants already in the country illegally or those with protections under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.

Trump outlined the plan's broad strokes in a Rose Garden speech at the White House, but the administration has not released a detailed summary or the full contents of the effort. Despite being touted as a policy proposal, the plan has not been converted into legislation.

As expected, the proposal centers on establishing a merit-based system for legal immigration. It would increase the proportion of skill-based visas given each year from 12% to 57% while dramatically limiting visas given to immigrants who have family in the U.S., Trump said.

""We discriminate against genius, we discriminate brilliance, and we won't anymore,"" Trump said of the current immigration system, calling the rules ""senseless."" Trump also said the current rules bar Americans from entry-level jobs and drive wages down.

The plan notably does not decrease the number of visas given each year – a reversal of one of Trump's earliest immigration promises and one that may alienate immigration hard-liners.

Instead, it calls for the creation of a points-based visa program that would prioritize immigrants with high educational achievement or skill, those who are young and those who would earn high wages. All existing visa categories would be replaced with a new visa dubbed the ""Build America"" visa, Trump said.

""This will bring us in line with other countries and make us globally competitive,"" Trump said.

The proposal also includes efforts to revamp border security. Trump touted the creation of a border security trust fund that would be financed through fees and revenue collected at the border. The plan would also ensure that 100% of people and vehicles crossing the border are scanned for drugs and other illicit goods, Trump said, but he did not give specific details on how that would be accomplished. The president also said the plan would eliminate child smuggling and screen out ""frivolous"" asylum claims but similarly did not provide details on those promises.

Trump made no mention of the Obama-era DACA program, which allows immigrants brought to the country illegally as children to stay in the U.S. Trump has tried to do away with the program but has been blocked by the courts. DACA holders can currently renew their status, but new applications are not being accepted. DACA has been a key immigration priority for Democrats, and any plan without DACA protections is almost certainly a non-starter with Democratic lawmakers.

Trump positioned the plan less as a policy proposal and more as an advantage for himself and other Republicans heading into the 2020 election, saying that the vision will be one of the reasons Republicans will flip the House and retain the Senate and presidency.

Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser, devised the plan, and Republican senators were reportedly briefed on its contents this week to mixed levels of enthusiasm.

Sean Hannity: DOJ inspector general FISA abuse probe is 'done and it's devastating',https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-16-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/sean-hannity-doj-inspector-general-fisa-abuse-probe-is-done-and-its-devastating,"Fox News host Sean Hannity says he is hearing that the Justice Department inspector general's investigation into alleged Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act abuse is ""done and it's devastating.""

He made the assertion during his evening program on Wednesday and asked Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., if he also had heard any word on the investigation.

Graham, whose Judiciary Committee had been conducting his own FISA abuse inquiry, said he could not verify if Inspector General Michael Horowitz is done, but added that he expects the eventual report to be upsetting to anyone who cares about the rule of law.

Hannity first brought up the prospect of Horowitz's investigation being complete earlier in the show, speaking with Fox News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett and former Rep. Jason Chaffetz, who is now a Fox News contributor.

""I have sources telling me that Horowitz perhaps is even finished with his report and certainly the attorney general has been briefed on what is coming,"" Hannity said. He also referred to former U.S. Attorney Joe diGenova saying Horowitz determined that the three FISA extensions against onetime Trump campaign aide Carter Page were illegally obtained and was on the brink of finding the first FISA was completely illegal.

The completion of Horowitz's investigation would be news. Attorney General William Barr recently predicted that it would be complete in either late May or June, but there has been no official word of its progress since.

A Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment.

Horowitz announced his investigation in March 2018 in a statement that said his office was examining the Justice Department's and FBI's compliance with legal requirements as well as policies and procedures in applications filed with the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court related to Page as part of a larger counterintelligence probe into President Trump's campaign. Horowitz also said he would “review information that was known to the DOJ and the FBI at the time the applications were filed from or about an alleged FBI confidential source. Additionally, the OIG will review the DOJ’s and FBI’s relationship and communications with the alleged source as they relate to the FISC applications.” This “alleged FBI confidential source” is British ex-spy Christopher Steele, who authored the unverified dossier on Trump's ties to Russia that was used by the FBI in the Page warrant applications.

Horowitz can recommend that people be prosecuted. Jarrett noted that U.S. Attorney John Durham, whom Barr has tasked with reviewing the origins of the Russia investigation, could then ""subpoena people to haul them in front of a grand jury. I suspect there is a grand jury and they're well on their way to potential criminal indictments.""

Jarrett said the people ""likely"" in legal jeopardy are former FBI Director James Comey, former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, former FBI General Counsel James Baker, former FBI special agent Peter Strzok, former FBI lawyer Lisa Page, ""maybe"" former CIA Director John Brennan and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, and ""certainly"" Steele and Fusion GPS co-founder Glenn Simpson."

""We haven't made a decision, but I think you can guess which way we're leaning on our subpoena,"" Mnuchin said at a Senate Appropriations subcommittee hearing. He added, ""I take great comfort that there is a third branch of government to deal with that important issue.""

""This is why there are three branches of government, and if there is a difference of opinion, this will go to the third branch of government to be resolved,"" Mnuchin said, referring to the judicial branch.

House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal, D-Mass., made a formal request for six years of Trump's personal and business tax returns last month, which the Treasury Department rejected last week, prompting Neal to subpoena the documents last Friday. It is possible Neal will pursue a lawsuit in federal court in order to enforce the subpoena.

Neal's subpoena was one of several subpoenas issued by congressional Democrats conducting oversight of the Trump administration. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., subpoenaed the Justice Department for the unredacted version of special counsel Robert Mueller's report on Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and the president's alleged efforts to obstruct the probe.

Democrats could also move to hold Mnuchin or IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig, to whom the original request for Trump's returns was addressed, in contempt of Congress.

Neal first made the request for six years of Trump's personal and business tax returns on April 3. He originally demanded the returns under a portion of the federal tax code that says the IRS ""shall furnish"" the returns of any taxpayer to the chairman of the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee.

Mnuchin refused to provide the documents by the chairman's original April 10 deadline, saying the Treasury needed more time to complete the request and consult with the Justice Department. Neal then set a second deadline of April 23, which Mnuchin also missed, saying he expected Treasury to make a final decision by May 6. The Treasury missed that deadline last week.

Democrats have been on a hunt to obtain Trump's tax returns since he bucked decades of tradition when he refused to release them during the 2016 election cycle. Although not required by law, every major party presidential nominee since the 1970s has chosen to publicly release his or her tax returns except for Gerald Ford, who only released a summary. Financial disclosures can help paint a fuller picture of a candidate's business positions and interests by providing information about financial dealings, such as investments, donations, business relationships, assets and possible conflicts of interests.

Trump has made clear he does not want to turn over his tax returns, claiming he cannot disclose them as a result of being audited by the IRS. However, an audit does not prevent a taxpayer from releasing his or her own tax documents. The administration has indicated it plans to fight congressional requests for information about the president's finances.

Democrats requested Trump's returns as part of their wide-ranging investigations into potential conflicts of interests posed by his business dealings. Republicans, meanwhile, have criticized the request as merely a pretext for a political attack.

Mnuchin, for his part, has fought to protect the president's financial information from public disclosure, arguing the request to turn over his returns would create a dangerous precedent. Democrats, meanwhile, have argued the power for lawmakers to seek the returns is written explicitly in a 1924 law. They have also argued they need to see the president's returns to ensure the IRS was conducting audits properly.

Mnuchin on Wednesday said the tax scuffle was ""a very important issue that has a precedent way beyond any one president and Congress.""

""There is a difference in interpretation between Congress and us and the Department of Justice around this law that not only impacts this president and this Congress but has a very big impact on every single taxpayer in weaponizing the IRS,"" Mnuchin said. ""And this is why there are three branches of government.""

He also said Congress did not need to see the president's tax returns to ensure the IRS was fairly enforcing the law.

(Susan Walsh/AP)

A top U.S. arms control official and prominent Iran hawk has resigned from the State Department after serving just over a year in the position, said U.S. officials and congressional aides familiar with the decision.

The State Department on Monday did not offer a statement explaining the planned departure of Yleem Poblete, the assistant secretary of state for arms control, verification and compliance.

Her departure, which is expected to take effect in the coming weeks, creates a vacancy as the Trump administration faces major new threats and challenges specifically related to arms control.

Iran recently threatened to resume production of nuclear centrifuges in response to President Trump’s decision last year to withdraw from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal and reimpose economic sanctions. Trump has also ordered his top aides to make a new push for a historic trilateral arms control agreement involving Russia and China, something Beijing has long dismissed.

During her tenure, Poblete clashed with her boss, Undersecretary of State Andrea Thompson, Vice President Pence’s former national security adviser, said the officials and aides familiar with the infighting.

In particular, disagreements surfaced over the State Department’s report on international compliance with arms control accords, the people said.

“The tension over the compliance report has been very real, and [Thompson’s office] is now demanding sign-off much earlier in the clearance process,” said one State Department official, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss personnel moves.

In April, Reuters reported that some U.S. officials were concerned that the compliance report politicized and slanted assessments about Iran, which the Trump administration has singled out as the country’s principal foe.

Poblete, whose views on arms control were more aligned with national security adviser John Bolton rather than Thompson’s, previously served as the chief of staff of the House Foreign Affairs Committee among other jobs.

As her confirmation process for the senior arms control job dragged on, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders excoriated Democrats and emphasized the importance of the position.

“It has been almost 150 days since Dr. Poblete was nominated,” Sanders said. “Senator Schumer is holding her up, putting the safety and security of the American people and, frankly, the entire world in danger.”

Poblete was a favorite among hard-line anti-Iran groups such as the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, which hosted her for a speech in July 2018 in which Poblete praised the U.S. withdrawal from the Iran deal.

“The JCPOA was flawed at both the technical and political levels, and at the practical level,” she said in the speech, referring to the acronym for the 2015 deal.

Nonproliferation experts who supported the Iran deal viewed her departure with ambivalence.

“While the State Department can hardly afford to lose another senior leader, it is not clear that Assistant Secretary Poblete was contributing to the advancement of arms control in a helpful or substantive way,” said Alexandra Bell, senior policy director at the Center for Arms Control and nonproliferation and a former Obama administration official. “The recent debacle involving the sloppy and politically charged summary of the unclassified 2019 Compliance Report is an example of that.”

“The Trump administration should immediately move to appoint a qualified, seasoned expert to the position,” she added.

Democrats on the House Natural Resources Committee grilled the newly appointed Interior Secretary over his thoughts on climate change and how the agency, which oversees drilling on national lands, should consider climate impacts as it drafts its policies.

“You have the discretion to issue oil and gas leases on federal lands. There are certain laws that require the department to take climate change into account when it's managing its land. And so Interior would have the ability to make choices that would be consistent with those goals,” Rep. Diana DeGette Diana Louise DeGetteOvernight Energy: Dems press Interior chief to embrace climate action | Lawmakers at odds on how to regulate chemicals in water | Warren releases climate plan for military Interior chief dismisses climate concerns in first Natural Resources hearing: 'I haven't lost any sleep over it' A new age for tobacco — raising the age to 21 is a smart move MORE (D-Colo.) told Bernhardt at the hearing.

Emissions from drilling on public lands make up nearly a quarter of all greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S, according to a federal report released last November.

“I think if you all have a view on climate change that says don’t develop energy on federal lands that’s fine. You have to go through a process of codifying it and providing that direction. And if you provide it, I’ll faithfully execute it,” Bernhardt told the lawmakers.

“Just to say from today forward, David Bernhardt says, ‘No development on public lands,’ I do not have that authority.”

Rep. Mike Levin (D-Calif.) challenged Bernhardt’s claim that the Interior chief didn’t have enough authority to make decisions on global warming without a congressional bill.

“You claim that Congress hasn’t given you enough direction to address climate change,” Levin said. “What type of direction would you want Congress to give you to make it clearer?""

Bernhardt said he wasn’t given specific direction to stop drilling.

“Whatever you think you can do to stop it. If that’s what you want to do, go for it. But that should happen in this body. That’s not something the Department of Interior does with a magic wand,” he said, shrugging off the obligation.

Democratic lawmakers challenged Bernhardt on a range of issues during the committee hearing, his first as Interior head. Questions revolved around reports that he signed off on policy decisions that ultimately benefited various former lobbying clients of his and that he’s been stonewalling providing members with requested internal documents.

“I call this the gibberish slide. I have no idea what this says, but you sent it on,” Lowenthal said.

Liberal lawmakers on the committee challenged that while Interior had provided large quantities of documents, they had not provided information specific enough to their requests, which they labeled a clear attempt to obfuscate.

“There is quantitative response to the request and qualitative response to the request… The qualitative response is our point. While we have reams of paper, we don’t have quality content,” said Rep. Raul Grijalva (D-Ariz), chairman of the committee.

Grijalva had previously been vocal about his frustration with Interior’s lack of response to requests for documents. The testiness between the Interior Department and his committee nearly exploded into a standoff two weeks ago when Bernhardt wouldn't commit to a date to testify before it.

Bernhardt later agreed after Grijalva promised to first hold a one-on-one meeting with him.

“The committee needs to know what kind of relationship we're going to have with you as an equal branch of government from now on,” Grijalva asked Bernhardt at the hearing.

“I’d like to hear from you if you feel the same way the President does in terms of committee oversight. Can we expect to have a healthy relationship with the Interior Department?”

Bernhardt acknowledged there was frustration, and said maybe they could find a way to sit down again and discuss expectations further."
VA Sec. Wilkie: A breakthrough in health care for veterans is coming in June -- Here's what to expect,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Robert Wilkie', 'Robert Wilkie Is The Secretary Of The U.S. Department Of Veterans Affairs']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/sec-robert-wilkie-bringing-bipartisan-reform-to-veterans,"Imagine if Republicans and Democrats worked together to pass reforms that improve the lives of millions of people.

And imagine if those reforms put America’s veterans at the center of their health care decisions, leading to better customer service for our nation’s heroes.

This isn’t hypothetical. It happened last year when Congress passed the MISSION Act.

TRUMP REPORTEDLY TAKING BROAD LOOK AT VETERANS CONVICTED OF BATTLEFIELD CRIMES

The law gives the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) the ability to provide veterans with the best health care possible, whether at VA health care facilities or with community providers.

The legislation sailed through Congress with overwhelming bipartisan support and the strong backing of veterans service organizations.

President Donald J. Trump’s signature put us on a path to implementing these reforms. On June 6, the MISSION Act will enable VA to consolidate the department’s community care efforts into a single, simple-to-use program that will empower veterans with the ability to choose the health care providers they trust.

So what can veterans expect on June 6?

Less red tape, more satisfaction and predictability for patients, more efficiency for our clinicians, and better value for taxpayers.

Veterans will be eligible to get community care for a variety of reasons, including when VA can’t provide the treatment they need or when care outside our system is in the best medical interest of the patient.

We listened to veterans and heard they preferred standards based on drive times rather than driving mileage because those standards better reflect veteran experiences, especially in large urban areas with lots of traffic.

To ensure our veterans are spending their time getting care instead of driving to it, patients facing an average drive time of 30-minutes or more for VA primary or mental health care, or non-institutional extended care services, will have the option of choosing a community provider closer to home. For specialty care, the drive-time standard will be an average of 60 minutes.

And to get veterans the care they need when they need it, VA patients facing a 20-day or more wait time for primary or mental health care, or non-institutional extended care services, will have the option of choosing a community provider who can deliver that care faster. For specialty care, the wait-time standard will be 28 days.

For additional convenience and timely treatment, eligible veterans will also have access to urgent, walk-in care that gives them the choice to receive certain services at participating community clinics in their communities. (To access this new benefit, veterans will select a provider in VA’s community care network and may be charged a copayment.)

Veterans will be encouraged to ask VA about these new options, and well-trained staff will be available to help them quickly understand their choices.

These exciting and important changes speak to my top priority – delivering the best medical customer service and offering veterans more health care choices.

With the MISSION Act, the future of the VA health care system will lie in the hands of veterans – precisely where it should be.

While we still have more work to do, the VA is making progress.

We are seeing more patients than ever before, more quickly than ever before and studies show VA now compares favorably to the private sector for access and quality of care – and in many cases exceeds it.

And veterans have noticed.

Patients’ trust in VA care has skyrocketed to 87.7 percent, and in the last fiscal year, VA completed more than 58 million internal appointments – a record high and 623,000 more than the year before.

VA employees are noticing improvements as well. VA ranked sixth out of 17 Federal Government agencies in the Partnership for Public Service’s most recent “Best Places to Work” survey, up from 17th the year prior.

To maintain the trust of our veterans, we must continue to deliver. And we will constantly innovate, upgrade, and pursue ways to better serve our Nation’s heroes.

The MISSION Act is a vital part of this effort, giving VA the ability to implement the best practices we’ve learned in our nearly 75 years of experience offering community care.

The core of the doctor-patient relationship is trust. President Trump promised veterans that this core value would shape the VA.

Columnist

Reading George Packer’s sprawling, mesmerizing biography “Our Man: Richard Holbrooke and the End of the American Century,” I felt a shock of recognition. Not just because I knew Holbrooke and could so readily recognize him in Packer’s novelistic portrait. I realized that Holbrooke could be egomaniacal, but, like Packer, I liked and respected him anyway. He was charming company and a supportive mentor, at least when you were no threat to him — and I wasn’t.

But there’s another reason I felt a pang of familiarity while devouring “Our Man”: Packer’s description of Holbrooke reminded me of the protagonist of my book “The Road Not Taken: Edward Lansdale and the American Tragedy in Vietnam.” Lansdale was a legendary covert operative who, while working for the CIA, masterminded the defeat of the Hukbalahap rebellion, a communist insurgency in the Philippines, in the early 1950s, and then moved to Saigon, where in 1954 he helped create the state of South Vietnam.

There were, to be sure, many differences between them. Lansdale was never as ambitious or egotistical as Holbrooke, who once told a girlfriend, “I’m going to be the next Henry Kissinger.” (“That was the end of her fling with Holbrooke,” Packer writes.) Nor was he a social climber like Holbrooke, who cultivated powerful older men such as W. Averell Harriman and romanced successful women such as TV journalist Diane Sawyer. Lansdale’s ambition was to advance the cause of democracy in Asia, not himself. He even hesitated to accept an offer from President John F. Kennedy to become the U.S. ambassador to South Vietnam. Holbrooke, by contrast, was incessantly scheming for self-advancement. The only jobs he refused were the ones he judged beneath his exalted status. Holbrooke’s epic womanizing also put Lansdale to shame. Lansdale had only one mistress — Pat Kelly, the great love of his life — and he eventually married her after the death of his first wife.

But despite the many differences, I detected a strong resemblance between Holbrooke and Lansdale. Both were unconventional, strong-willed, occasionally ruthless characters. Both were animated by a powerful, perhaps excessive, faith in the United States as a force for good. Both played by their own rules. And both could not hide their disdain for deskbound, risk-averse bureaucrats.

The similarities were not coincidental. Holbrooke’s first job as a tyro diplomat in 1963 was working in Saigon for the U.S. Embassy’s Office of Rural Affairs. Its head was Rufus Phillips, a courtly Virginian, late of Yale University and the CIA, who was a protege of Lansdale’s. He taught the young Holbrooke the tenets of “Lansdalism”: To win a war among the people, you had to win over the people rather than blow them to smithereens. This was a simple yet powerful insight, later labeled “population-centric counterinsurgency,” that Holbrooke imbibed long before it became fashionable.

Phillips also reflected Lansdale’s informal and idealistic approach. Rural Affairs was a “shirtsleeves” outfit where no one stood on protocol and everyone was encouraged to get close to the Vietnamese people. Before long, Holbrooke was a provincial representative far from the comforts of Saigon. Decades later, when Holbrooke was appointed special representative to Afghanistan and Pakistan, Packer writes, he modeled his office on Rural Affairs — “the freedom and openness, the hostility to bureaucratic convention, the sense of excitement and risk.”

That Holbrooke ended his career working for the secretary of state, rather than being secretary of state himself, was a source of endless frustration to him. So, too, was the fact that his advice was constantly ignored. Lansdale suffered a similar, agonizing fate: He was sidelined from Vietnam policy in the Kennedy administration as the United States was drawing closer to a quagmire that he saw more clearly than most. When Lansdale went back to Vietnam in 1965 to work on winning “hearts and minds,” he was as ineffectual as Holbrooke proved to be on Afghanistan policy in 2009-2010.

Both Holbrooke and Lansdale blamed others for their downfall, but ultimately both sabotaged themselves through a lack of self-awareness. While interviewing for a job in the Obama administration, Holbrooke corrected President-elect Barack Obama when Obama referred to him as “Dick.” “Would you do me a favor, Mr. President?” Holbrooke said. “It’s important to my wife that you call me ‘Richard.'” Little wonder Obama had an instant aversion to him. Lansdale was similarly clueless in his dealings with Defense Secretary Robert S. McNamara. He would lecture on how to fight the Viet Cong while failing to notice the secretary’s eyes glaze over. “He was turning McNamara off,” a subordinate told me, “but waxing more and more enthusiastic, speaking more rapidly.”

The tragedy of Holbrooke’s and Lansdale’s lives is that if they had attained higher office, they might have changed U.S. foreign policy for the better, perhaps avoiding costly mistakes in Vietnam and Afghanistan. They certainly could have done better than many of the inoffensive nonentities who supplanted them. As it was, they achieved a great deal — Lansdale in defeating communism in the Philippines, Holbrooke in negotiating peace in Bosnia. But their maverick ways ultimately caused them to be rejected by the system. Presidents in the future would be well-advised to show greater tolerance for troublemakers and truth tellers.

Inspector General Michael Horowitz is examining the Justice Department's and FBI's compliance with legal requirements as well as policies and procedures in applications filed with the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court related to onetime Trump campaign adviser Carter Page.

Baker, who admitted last week the inspector general makes him ""nervous,"" said the government watchdog will probably find some errors.

""The inspector general is looking at everything we did,"" Baker said on CNN. ""If the IG usually finds mistakes that we made, so I expect him to find mistakes this time.""

Baker said last week at an event in Washington, D.C., that he took a leading role in overseeing the FISA warrant applications to obtain the authority to spy on Page. Baker said on Monday he does not believe there was any intent from the people he worked with to do ""anything wrong or illegal,"" including politically motivated spying.

Baker was appointed FBI general counsel in January 2014 and reassigned by FBI Director Christopher Wray in December 2017. Last year, it was reported that Baker was resigning, and since has written for Lawfare and joined the R Street Institute.

Attorney General William Barr has said he expects Horowitz to complete his investigation in late May or June. A particular issue in the investigation is the FBI's reliance on an unverified dossier in the FISA warrant application process."
