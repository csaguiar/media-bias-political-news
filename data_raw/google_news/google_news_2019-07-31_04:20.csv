Twitter suspends account hours after Trump retweeted it,https://www.cnn.com,"[""Donie O'Sullivan""]",07-30-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/30/politics/trump-retweet-twitter-account-deleted/index.html,"Washington (CNN) In a move that will likely embolden President Donald Trump's claims that social media companies are biased against him and his supporters, Twitter suspended an account Tuesday evening that the President had retweeted just hours earlier.

Trump retweeted a post from an account operating under the name ""Lynn Thomas"" that accused Democrats of being ""the true enemies of America."" The account, which created in September 2018, described itself as a ""Fierce Trump supporter"" and declared: ""I'm not a bot.""

Just a few hours later, Twitter had suspended the account, confirming to CNN it had broken the platform's rules. The company did not say what rules the account had broken.

In an interview with C-SPAN set to air Tuesday night , Trump said he has ""not much"" regret when it comes to the tens of thousands of tweets he has sent, but he also acknowledged that it can be an issue when he retweets other accounts.

"Judge dismisses DNC hacking lawsuit against Trump team, says claims 'entirely divorced from the facts'",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dnc-lawsuit-trump-campaign-russia-wikileaks-hacking-dismissed,"A federal judge in frank terms Tuesday dismissed a lawsuit by the Democratic National Committee (DNC) against key members of the Trump campaign and WikiLeaks over hacked DNC documents, saying they ""did not participate in any wrongdoing in obtaining the materials in the first place"" and therefore bore no legal liability for disseminating the information.

The ruling came as Democrats increasingly have sought to tie the Trump team to illegal activity in Russia, in spite of former Special Counsel Robert Mueller's findings that the campaign in fact refused multiple offers by Russians to involve them in hacking and disinformation efforts.

President Trump, in a tweet late Tuesday, noted that the judge in the case, John Koeltl, was appointed by Bill Clinton. The president called Koeltl's decision ""really big 'stuff'"" and ""yet another total & complete vindication and exoneration.""

The DNC had asserted in court filings that the Trump team's meetings ""with persons connected to the Russian government during the time that the Russian GRU agents were stealing the DNC's information"" were ""circumstantial evidence"" that they were conspiring with the Russians to ""steal and disseminate the DNC's materials.""

MCCONNELL CONDEMNS 'MODERN DAY MCCARTHYISM' IN FIERY FLOOR SPEECH, SLAMS 'FECKLESS' OBAMA RUSSIA POLICY

The suit did not allege that the stolen materials were false or defamatory but rather sought to hold the Trump team and other defendants liable for the theft of the DNC's information under various Virginia and federal statutes, including the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act, Wiretap Act, Stored Communications Act, Digital Millenium Copyright Act, and laws protecting trade secrets.

However, Judge Koeltl, sitting in the Southern District of New York, wrote in his 81-page opinion Tuesday that the DNC's argument was ""entirely divorced"" from the factual record in the case.

The DNC first filed its suit in April 2018, and the defendants responded that the First Amendment legally protected the dissemination of stolen materials.

""In short, the DNC raises a number of connections and communications between the defendants and with people loosely connected to the Russian Federation, but at no point does the DNC allege any facts ... to show that any of the defendants -- other than the Russian Federation -- participated in the theft of the DNC's information,"" Koeltl said.

""Nor does the DNC allege that the defendants ever agreed to help the Russian Federation steal the DNC's documents,"" he added.

The DNC claimed the defendants illegally compromised their trade secrets contained in some of the stolen documents -- including donor lists and strategies. But, the judge said, any such claim to trade secrecy was lost when the documents became public in the first place, and in any event, the newsworthiness of the matter trumped the trade secrecy issue.

""If Wikileaks could be held liable for publishing documents concerning the DNC's political financial and voter-engagement strategies simply because the DNC labels them 'secret' and trade secrets, then so could any newspaper or other media outlet,"" the judge wrote. That, he said, would elevate a privacy interest impermissibly over the First Amendment rights of people and media outlets to disseminate matters of ""the highest public concern.""

Koeltl went on to describe multiple hacking efforts directed by Russians at the DNC, in which Russians ""hacked into the DNC's computers, penetrated its phone systems, and stole tens of thousands of documents.""

But, even if the Russians had provided the hacked documents to the Trump team directly, the judge wrote, it would not be criminal for the campaign to then publish those documents, as long as they did not contribute to the hacking itself. Similarly, the judge said, it is not criminal to merely solicit or ""welcome"" stolen documents.

Koeltl cited the infamous Pentagon Papers case in which the Supreme Court held that The New York Times and The Washington Post were protected by the First Amendment when they published articles concerning the government's public justification for the Vietnam War.

""At first glance, this opinion raises serious concerns about our protections from foreign election interference and the theft of private property to advance the interests of our enemies,"" DNC spokesperson Adrienne Watson said.

The suit also named the Russian government, but Koeltl noted that federal law prohibited suits against foreign governments except in highly specific circumstances. Koeltl nevertheless acknowledged that the Russian government ""undoubtedly"" was involved in the hacking.

Koeltl denied the Trump team's motion for sanctions but dismissed the suit with prejudice -- meaning it had a substantive legal defect and could not be refiled. An appeal remained possible.

FBI FALSELY TOLD FISA COURT FOUR TIMES THAT YAHOO NEWS ARTICLE PROVIDED INDEPENDENT BASIS TO BELIEVE DOSSIER

In addition to the Trump campaign, WikiLeaks, and Russia, the DNC's suit named Donald Trump Jr., Paul Manafort, Jared Kushner, George Papadopoulos, Richard Gates (whose connections with Russia were especially ""threadbare,"" the judge wrote), Roger Stone, Joseph Mifsud and Julian Assange.

The DNC in its complaint mentioned, among other contacts, Papadopoulos' meeting with Mifsud in Italy in March 2016, as well as the claim Mifsud told Papadopoulos on April 26, 2016, that the Russians had ""dirt"" on Hillary Clinton in the form of thousands of emails.

The FBI probe into the Trump team came after the bureau learned Papadopoulos then allegedly told an Australian diplomat about his contacts with Russians.

Mifsud had ties to both western and Russian intelligence, and Papadopoulos relayed to his superiors on the Trump campaign that there were ""interesting messages coming in from Moscow."" There has been no evidence Papadopoulos told the Trump team specifically about the stolen emails.

The DNC also focused on statements from Stone that may have suggested he had advance warning of pending email hacks or dissemination, as well as Trump Jr.'s statement that he would ""love"" to receive potentially damaging information on Clinton. Several other communications from Trump officials to Russians or people tied to Russia were mentioned throughout the DNC's complaint.

None of these alleged episodes, the judge ruled, established a criminal conspiracy.

Republicans, meanwhile, have focused increasingly on the DNC's own apparent role in the origins of the FBI's probe into the Trump campaign, which began in the summer of 2016 -- after British ex-spy Christopher Steele, a longtime FBI informant funded by the DNC and Hillary Clinton campaign, began work on his now-discredited dossier.

The dossier was used in secret surveillance warrants to monitor members of the Trump team, and later fueled media reports that kept the investigation going, despite many apparent problems with its reliability. Multiple DOJ reviews into the dossier's use, and related matters, were ongoing.

The chances of the FBI securing a secret 2016 surveillance warrant for a Trump campaign aide were “50/50” without the controversial anti-Trump “dossier,” according to testimony in recently confirmed congressional transcripts from senior FBI lawyer Sally Moyer to House investigators.

And, Papadopoulos on Sunday told Fox News he was heading back to Greece to retrieve $10,000 that he suspected was dropped in his lap during the campaign as part of an entrapment scheme by the CIA or FBI. Federal investigators want to see the marked bills, which he said were stored in a safe.

Papadopoulos said on ""Sunday Morning Futures"" he was ""very happy"" to see House Intelligence Committee Ranking Member Devin Nunes, R-Calif., grill Mueller about the summer 2017 payment during last week's hearings -- even though Mueller maintained, without explanation, that the matter was outside the scope of his investigation.

""I was very happy to see that Devin Nunes brought that up,"" Papadopoulos said. ""A man named Charles Tawil gave me this money [in Israel] under very suspicious circumstances. A simple Google search about this individual will reveal he was a CIA or State Department asset in South Africa during the '90s and 2000s. I think around the time when Bob Mueller was the director of the FBI.""

California Requires Trump Tax Returns Under New Election Law,https://www.nytimes.com,"['Jennifer Medina', 'Annie Karni']",07-30-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/30/us/politics/california-trump-tax-returns.html,"“The Constitution is clear on the qualifications for someone to serve as president and states cannot add additional requirements on their own,” Mr. Murtaugh said. “The bill also violates the First Amendment right of association since California can’t tell political parties which candidates their members can or cannot vote for in a primary election.”

The Trump campaign, which has been closely tracking ballot access issues for months and coordinating with the White House Counsel’s Office, is likely to respond with a lawsuit, according to an official with the campaign. That suit could potentially include a number of plaintiffs, including the Republican National Committee, the California Republican Party and the Trump campaign, but the official warned that nothing about a suit had been finalized.

Nearly a dozen similar bills are active in other states, including New York, New Jersey, Washington and Pennsylvania, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.

The vast majority of presidential nominees in the last several decades have released their tax returns, with the exception of Gerald Ford in 1976. Mr. Brown and his Republican opponents declined to release their returns during the governor’s races in 2010 and 2014.

Mr. Brown warned in his veto message that such legislation would be a slippery slope.

“A qualified candidate’s ability to appear on the ballot is fundamental to our democratic system,” he wrote. “For that reason, I hesitate to start down a road that well might lead to an ever escalating set of differing state requirements for presidential candidates.”

After Democratic state senators introduced the same legislation this year, aides to Mr. Newsom asked the sponsors to add the requirements for candidates for governor as well.

“This is a huge step forward for financial transparency from people who are trying to become the most powerful person in the world,” said Scott Wiener, the state senator from San Francisco who sponsored the bill. “It is absolutely not just written for Donald Trump. This is for every Democratic and Republican and presidential candidate until the end of time.”"
Apple baits Trump by saying it wants to keep making Mac Pro in the US,https://www.theverge.com,['Jul'],07-30-2019,2019,7,https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/30/20747765/apple-mac-pro-2019-united-states-production-assembly,"During this afternoon’s call with investors, Apple CEO Tim Cook said that the company aims to assemble the 2019 Mac Pro in the United States — just as it did with the previous “trash can” design of the high-end desktop. Apple highlighted the US assembly of that device and even made a video promoting it. But the company made no mention of having the same plans for the Mac Pro it revealed at WWDC in June.

Yet according to Cook, US assembly is exactly why Apple requested an exclusion from the US government’s tariffs on importing goods from China. If Apple gets hit with an added fee for those parts, it might consider the whole plan unfeasible.

“In terms of the exclusions, we’ve been making the Mac Pro in the US. We want to continue to do that,” Cook said. “So we’re working and investing currently in capacity to do so, because want to continue to be here. And so that’s what’s behind the exclusions. So we’re explaining that and hope for a positive outcome.”

The exclusion request was denied on Friday by President Trump, but it’s clear that Cook remains hopeful a decision will ultimately be made in Apple’s favor — especially where US jobs are involved. This is obviously a statement meant to find its way to the president. The very fact that Apple asked for its waiver to apply to specific parts should’ve been a clue of the company’s intention to continue with US-based Mac Pro assembly.

The Wall Street Journal previously reported that Mac Pro production would be moved entirely to China. Apple did not refute that claim, and there’s still a possibility that both of these things are true: Apple might start out putting the new machine together in China early in the production run before shifting assembly to the US once it’s equipped to do so. The new Mac Pro is scheduled to begin shipping this fall; Apple hasn’t publicly given a more specific release date.

If we had a normal US President...,https://www.cnn.com,['Frida Ghitis'],07-29-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/29/opinions/if-we-had-a-normal-us-president-russia-china-ghitis/index.html,"Frida Ghitis, a former CNN producer and correspondent, is a world affairs columnist.

(CNN) In another time, the President of the United States might have called an urgent press conference on Monday morning -- making sure he could command the world's attention -- and issued a stern warning that violent repression of peaceful protesters is intolerable.

After all, what we saw this weekend in Moscow and Hong Kong were alarming signs that a wave of more brutal repression is looming. The regimes in Moscow and Beijing have sent notice that they are about to crush peaceful, popular movements. This should alarm the US president and produce an urgent response.

Instead, President Donald Trump woke up Monday morning prepared to stoke racist sentiment across the United States, tweeting a new barrage of inflammatory messages against prominent African American figures in what has become a familiar pattern : racist tweets from the President, widespread condemnation by the public, doubling down by the President. Trump is making racism his trademark, spending his time energizing racists while decisively removing America from the moral high ground.

Perhaps not coincidentally, this is happening at the time when democracy activists most desperately need a show of support. They could use a strong statement from Washington telling the leaders in Russia and China that the world is watching. That their actions could have consequences. That, at the very least, their position on the global stage is teetering. That the American people stand on the side of those demanding justice.

Consider what happened in Russia, where pro-democracy activists have been protesting for the right to vote after authorities brazenly disqualified opposition candidates for an upcoming municipal election. President Vladimir Putin's approval has been sliding, discontent growing, and the largest protests in years have taken place, even though Russian law now makes it nearly impossible to obtain a protest permit.

This weekend, police sent rows of menacing riot police to break down a peaceful protest, arresting more than a thousand people in Moscow.

Most alarming is what happened to opposition leader Alexei Navalny, whose very life may well depend on whether the rest of the world makes it clear to the Kremlin that, if he is killed, there will be consequences.

Navalny was arrested earlier in the week after calling for a demonstration. Then, suddenly, on Sunday, he was rushed to a hospital with what the hospital called an ""acute allergic reaction."" He does not suffer from allergies. The news immediately brought to mind the fate of other Kremlin critics who have faced, shall we call it, biochemical issues.

Recall the horrific disfigurement of former Ukraine President Viktor Yushchenko, the Ukrainian politician who dared to challenge Putin's preferred candidate in 2004. He narrowly escaped death after being poisoned with dioxin. He believes the Kremlin was behind the assassination attempt.

The Kremlin stands accused of poisoning other Putin critics, even exiled ones, including Alexander Litvinenko, who died from radioactive polonium poisoning blamed on Putin by a UK inquest, and Sergei Skripal and his daughter, poisoned in Salisbury, England. British authorities have accused two Russian men of carrying out the hit, saying they belong to Russian military intelligence. The men say they were simply tourists visiting Salisbury.

Other Kremlin critics have died mysterious deaths. The popular politician and Putin critic Boris Nemtsov, shot in front of the Kremlin, former ally Boris Berezovsky, who supposedly killed himself, and many, many courageous journalists. The Committee to Protect Journalists counts 28 Russian journalists killed since 2000, the year Putin rose to power.

Navalny's personal doctor says he has been taken back out of the hospital into prison against her advice. She thinks he has been poisoned. Perhaps it was a warning, perhaps an attempt on his life. Navalny, back in prison on Monday, suggested he may have been poisoned while in police custody.

A well-articulated warning from Washington might just save him and others.

A warning to Beijing is just as urgent. For weeks the people of Hong Kong have waged peaceful protests against a government that is supposed to be independent of China under the ""one country, two systems"" model agreed when the territory reverted to China from the UK.

Protests started against a bill that would have allowed extradition to China, where the legal system is beholden to the Communist Party-controlled regime. The protests have been massive, bringing out as many as two million people in a territory of just seven million, underscoring how widespread and intense the distrust of China is.

Beijing has been growing impatient, and the signs are nothing short of ominous.

Last week, the spokesman for the Chinese military, Wu Qian, issued a chilling reminder that China's military forces could be quickly deployed inside Hong Kong if the territory's authorities request it. Then he described the protests in a way that made very clear Beijing is running out of patience. The protesters' behavior, Wu declared, ""is intolerable.""

That was Wednesday. On Sunday, Hong Kong police clad in riot gear launched a harsh crackdown against demonstrators. CNN's Anna Coren, in the midst of the mayhem , was visibly horrified. The protesters were completely peaceful, she said.

On Monday, China issued its sternest warning yet, accusing pro-democracy protesters of committing "" evil and criminal acts .""

One shudders to think what might come next at the hands of the regime that massacred protesters at Tiananmen Square 30 years ago.

When the tanks rolled in Tiananmen, then-President George H.W. Bush wasted no time publicly condemning the regime, as have other American presidents who spoke firmly and decisively against repression.

Sure, America has failed many times, and its own history is far from immaculate, but the words of a credible American president can help draw the moral lines. It may or may not stay the hand of a tyrant, it may or may not prevent a massacre. But at the very least it helps clarify what is and is not legitimate conduct in our time. Even if it fails to stop a catastrophe in progress, it may give second thoughts to another tinpot tyrant watching from a distance.

How tragic for America and for the world that Washington today is dominated by a President who thinks nothing matters more than his personal fate and believes inciting racist hatreds at home tops the national agenda."
"DOJ investigating Zinke's use of personal email, inspector tells lawmakers",https://www.politico.com,['Nick Juliano'],07-30-2019,2019,7,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/07/30/zinke-email-justice-energy-1627744,"Former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke resigned in December amid scrutiny over his participation in a land deal with the chairman of Halliburton. | Shawn Thew - Pool/Getty Images energy DOJ investigating Zinke's use of personal email, inspector tells lawmakers

The Justice Department is investigating whether former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke used personal email accounts for official business, a matter that has become part of a larger criminal probe into the departed official, according to a letter released by House Democrats on Tuesday.

The letter is the first public confirmation of a criminal investigation into Zinke, a former Republican congressman from Montana who faced scrutiny about his mixing of official, personal and political business while in President Donald Trump’s Cabinet.

Story Continued Below

The Interior Department's acting inspector general, Gail Ennis, told the lawmakers that the email investigation has been combined with an ongoing probe the IG is conducting with DOJ. That larger probe includes Zinke's participation in a land deal with the chairman of Halliburton, as well as Interior's obstruction of a tribal casino project in Connecticut following extensive lobbying by a rival casino company, both issues that were first reported by POLITICO.

House Natural Resources Chairman Raúl Grijalva and Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings requested the email investigation in April 2018, when both were ranking members of their respective panels.

""Last year, the OIG began investigating the matter you presented contemporaneous to a related criminal investigation that we are coordinating with the Department of Justice,"" Ennis wrote to Cummings and Grijalva in her July 29 letter. ""In consultation with DOJ and to avoid any interference with the criminal case, we have decided to combine the investigations. When we write our final report of investigation, we will include information that addresses the issues raised in your letter.""

Zinke, who resigned in December, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. DOJ declined to comment.

Grijalva and Cummings welcomed the DOJ probe.

""This investigation and others like it are part of restoring public trust in government, which has suffered from the intentional destruction of the Trump years,"" Grijalva said in a statement. ""Leaving office half a step ahead of the law doesn’t wipe the slate clean. It’s imperative that political appointees at the Department of Justice allow this investigation to continue unimpeded regardless of the risk to Mr. Zinke or other Trump officials.""

EPA proposal scraps limits on coal plant waste,https://thehill.com,[],07-30-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/455386-epa-proposal-scraps-limits-on-coal-plant-waste,"The Trump administration on Wednesday proposed scrapping restrictions on arsenic-laden waste from coal-fired power plants.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed lifting some regulations on coal ash, the residue left after burning coal, which is filled with hazardous substances that can leach into the water supply and cause health problems.

“I can say without hesitation that this is an extremely dangerous proposal that will do lasting harm to communities near coal ash reuse sites and coal ash waste piles,” said Lisa Evans, senior counsel with Earthjustice.

Coal ash is used in a variety of ways, largely as a replacement for soil. It can be used to create level ground for construction projects or sprinkled over landfills as a protective cover.

But coal ash has been deemed responsible for contaminating water with arsenic, which is linked with some types of cancer.

The latest proposal from the EPA would eliminate restrictions from 2015 that limited coal ash use to 12,400 tons per site.

The Trump administration proposal would allow projects to use as much coal ash as they want but would have to file a demonstration that shows the project won’t cause harm if it’s close to certain features like groundwater or wetlands.

But Evans said that’s not a realistic safeguard.

“That demonstration doesn’t have to be defended to any regulatory agency or be posted for public notice or be written by any engineer or environmental professional,” Evans said. “You’ve got a fairly meaningless demo having to be created.”

The EPA said the regulations would help spur “beneficial use” — the term for new uses for what would otherwise be industry waste.

“Today the Agency is proposing sensible changes that will improve the coal ash regulations and continue to encourage appropriate beneficial use,” EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler Andrew WheelerJudge cuts Roundup cancer case payout from billion to million Automakers rebuff Trump, strike fuel efficiency deal with California Watchdog to probe potential interference by Interior officials in releasing public records MORE said in a statement. “These proposed changes will further responsible management of coal ash while protecting human health and the environment.”

The proposal includes some features that would make reporting requirements more accessible to the public, but environmentalists ultimately see the move as a bow to industry.

“Despite compelling and damning scientific evidence highlighting the harm to groundwater from coal ash, and court victories by community groups requiring the EPA to strengthen the 2015 rule, Wheeler is giving this gift to his former employers at the cost of public health,” Earthjustice and the Sierra Club said in a statement. “It is a disgrace to everything the EPA stands for, and we will do everything in our power to stop it.”"
US Defense Department to Develop Blockchain Cybersecurity Shield,https://www.coindesk.com,[],07-29-2019,2019,7,https://www.coindesk.com/us-department-of-defense-is-developing-a-blockchain-cybersecurity-shield,"The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) is looking to forge a blockchain cybersecurity shield.

In a report published on July 12 titled Digital Modernization Strategy, the DoD outlined several ways to advance the nation’s digital defenses. This includes the integration of cloud and quantum computing, artificial intelligence, and improved communications through distributed ledgers.

In fact, DARPA, the research wing of the Department is already experimenting with the technology “to create a more efficient, robust, and secure platform,” to secure messaging and process transactions, reports Decrypt.

Specifically, blockchain may be deployed between units and headquarters as well as intelligence officers and the Pentagon. As part of the Digital Identity Management program, the agency may also issue a digital token that authenticates an agent’s identity.

The DoD is also experimenting with the technology to facilitate the creation of an unhackable code to secure its databases.

As part of the second Cryptographic Modernization program, in effect since 2000, the Department is replacing old hardware and cryptographic systems to meet the challenges of the improved computing power of the nation’s adversaries.

Citing the trustless, transparent, and immutable attributes of blockchain the Department writes:

“Blockchain networks not only reduce the probability of compromise, but also impose significantly greater costs on an adversary to achieve it.”

The shift from “low value to high-value work” is also part of the DoDs’ Big Data Platform (BDP), which will handle petabytes of data involved in a number of cross-agency projects. The platform “provides the ability to perform aggregation, correlation, historical trending,” and may perform pattern recognition to “predict attacks.”

DHS issues hacking security alert for small planes,https://www.cbsnews.com,['Kris Van Cleave'],07-30-2019,2019,7,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/dhs-issues-hacking-security-alert-small-planes-today-2019-07-30/,"Washington — The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) issued a rare security alert Tuesday for small planes. The alert warns if a hacker gained physical access to certain small planes, they could attach a common device to its wiring. This could provide false flight data including altitude and airspeed, as well as possible access to the autopilot system, potentially leaving a pilot unable to tell whether the reading was accurate and potentially lose control of the aircraft.

""We could do basically anything the plane can do, pretty much anything the pilot could do by himself,"" said Tod Beardsley, director of research at cyber security firm Rapid7.

In a laboratory setting, researchers at Rapid7 were able to hack what's essentially a plane's electronic central nervous system, allowing them to send the erroneous commands. ""I do think it is something of a wake up call. This is something that needs to be taken seriously now rather than later, like after the disaster,"" Beardsley said.

Last year, Homeland Security researchers, who successfully hacked a 757 while it was parked, warned it's only ""a matter of time before a cybersecurity breach on an airline occurs."" DHS is now urging small plane makers to study the cyber security protections car makers added after hackers were able to exploit similar technology on the roads.

The Federal Aviation Administration tells CBS News a ""scenario that involves unrestricted physical access is unlikely"" but these findings are ""an important reminder to remain vigilant."" Rapid7 said it notified the company that built those two systems, but their findings prompted DHS to urge pilots to secure their aircraft and for manufacturers to take a look at options to better secure these systems."

PEBBLE MINE IS A GO: The Environmental Protection Agency announced Tuesday it will reverse an Obama-era decision to block a controversial Alaska mine project.

""After today's action EPA will focus on the permit review process for the Pebble Mine project"" Region 10 Administrator Chris Hladick said in a statement.

""The agency has worked closely with the Army Corps to engage with stakeholders and the public on this issue, which has resulted in an expansive public record, including specific information about the proposed mining project that did not exist in 2014,"" Hladick added.

While the EPA is withdrawing the 2014 determination, which it wrote ""was issued preemptively and is now outdated,"" the withdrawal does not constitute an approval of the permit application or a determination in the permitting process.

""Instead, it allows EPA to continue working with the Corps to review the current permit application and engage in the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) process,"" the statement reads.

The EPA announced in June it would resume consideration of the mining project, which former EPA head Scott Pruitt Edward (Scott) Scott PruittOvernight Energy: EPA halts surprise inspections of power, chemical plants | Regulators decline to ban pesticide linked to brain damage | NY awards country's largest offshore wind energy contracts EPA allows continued use of pesticide linked with brain damage Overnight Energy: Trump officials gut DC staff for public lands agency to move West | Democrats slam EPA over scientific boards | Deepwater Horizon most litigated environmental issue of decade MORE had also promised.

""Today's step is a move toward good government decision making, which we owe under the law to both the public and project proponents,"" EPA General Counsel Matthew Leopold said in a June statement.

The Obama EPA said the proposed mine would have a harmful effect on streams that feed Bristol Bay, which includes the world's largest salmon fishery, and in 2018 Pruitt announced the EPA would not seek to do away with the Obama-era decision.

""Until we know the full extent of that risk, those natural resources and world-class fisheries deserve the utmost protection,"" Pruitt said at the time.

NEW DIRECTOR AT BLM: The new head of the Interior Department's public lands agency once championed selling off federally-owned plots.

William Perry Pendley, a conservative lawyer from Wyoming, on Monday became the top official leading the Interior Department's Bureau of Land Management--the agency that oversees 12 percent of all U.S. land.

Interior Secretary David Bernhardt quietly signed a secretarial order Monday that effectively made Pendley acting director of BLM.

The staffing shake up came after Pendley was unceremoniously moved to the post of Deputy Director of BLM Policy and Programs last week, among the agency's highest positions.

News of the move was largely determined through a change to BLM's organization chart posted to its website. Interior has not returned calls for comment.

Bernhardt's secretarial order Monday called for a ""temporary redelegation of authority for certain vacant non-career senate-confirmed positions.""

The positions listed, including Pendley's, would become ""acting by operation of law.""

New chief's background: Pendley first joined the Interior Department last week. Previously, he was the president of Wyoming based Mountain States Legal Foundation, a group that in part advocated for the selling off millions of acres of federal lands out West.

The company's website hails its work as ""a non-profit, public interest law firm, focused on defending the constitution, protecting property rights, and advancing economic liberty.""

Multiple former Interior heads have come from the Mountain States Legal Foundation.

Pendley is the latest in a long line of acting directors at BLM. Previously Casey Hammond, the Interior Department's principal deputy assistant secretary for land and minerals management, served in the post. Before that, Michael Need, deputy director of operations, served in the role for seven months in 2017.

BLM under the microscope: Pendley's appointment comes as Interior and BLM are facing heavy scrutiny for their management of public lands and their employees.

The BLM manages 245 million acres of public lands. Last week Interior sparked condemnation for submitting plans for Utah's Bears Ears national monument that would open remaining lands for development after drastically shrinking the protection area in 2017.

The BLM in mid-July also submitted plans to relocate the majority of its agency staff outside of Washington, D.C., a move critics say will weaken the voices of career employees.

Conservation groups largely derided Pendley's post.

""William Perry Pendley is an ideological zealot whose views are deeply out of touch with the American mainstream,"" said Phil Hanceford, conservation director for The Wilderness Society.

""His ascending to the top of BLM just as it is being reorganized strongly suggests the administration is positioning itself to liquidate our shared public lands.""

US Defense Dept. to Experiment With Blockchain-Based Security,https://cointelegraph.com,"['Max Boddy', 'Crypto Fan', 'Masao Akimoto', 'Mystellar Org']",07-30-2019,2019,7,https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-defense-dept-to-experiment-with-blockchain-based-security,"The United States Department of Defense (DoD) is pursuing blockchain solutions for cybersecurity as part of its digital modernization strategy.

The DoD released plans for blockchain tech in its four-year roadmap on July 12, entitled “DoD Digital Modernization Strategy: DoD Information Resource Management Strategic Plan FY19–23.”

According to the report, the DoD’s research branch, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), is currently engaged in at least two exploratory blockchain projects focused on cybersecurity.

First, DARPA is experimenting with blockchain in order to construct a new — or improved — communication and transaction platform. Stated intentions for this platform include communications between units and headquarters as well as between intelligence officers and the Pentagon.

Second, DARPA is attempting to create an “unhackable code” with blockchain technology, citing blockchain’s ability to gather intel on bad actors who attempt to hack into databases.

DARPA’s blockchain workshop

As reported by Cointelegraph, DARPA previously announced plans to host a two-day blockchain workshop in February. DARPA was particularly keen on examining permissionless consensus protocols. The organization also noted that there were potentially valuable use cases for blockchain in data storage, saying:

“Technologies for distributed consensus protocols have been revolutionized by their prominent role in cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies. These technologies have dramatic implications for the security and resilience of critical data storage and computation tasks, including for the Department of Defense.”

In December 2018, DoD officials examined how blockchain technology could help emergencies responses in disaster situations in a presentation hosted by the Defense Logistics Agency Troop Support’s Continuous Process Improvement."
Border Patrol tried to fire him for lying about gun incident. Now he's Trump’s DHS spokesman,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-29-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/border-patrol-tried-to-fire-him-for-making-stuff-up-now-he-is-the-dhs-spokesman,"The top Homeland Security spokesman, brought in to serve last month by acting Secretary Kevin McAleenan, is a former Border Patrol agent whom U.S. Customs and Border Protection once attempted to fire for faking a crime against himself, according to three CBP officials with first-hand knowledge of the incident and a fourth who is also aware of it.

DHS acting Deputy Assistant Secretary of Media Operations Jose “Lu” Maheda was terminated by Border Patrol a year into his service during the 1990s. Since then, as one official put it, he has “failed up,” getting his job back and eventually becoming a regional Border Patrol spokesman. And now he is the top spokesman for the 240,000-person department because of his connection to McAleenan.

“The guy’s a proven liar and can’t testify in court and yet he’s a spokesman for DHS,” charged one CBP official who worked with Maheda at the time of the incident. “He is 100% a McAleenan sycophant.”

Under the 1972 Giglio v. United States decision, a witness whose integrity has been called into question cannot testify in court.

While working at the Border Patrol station in Nogales, Arizona during his first year on the job in 1996, Maheda left his loaded gun on the front seat of his work vehicle and set out on foot.

“While he was out — and unbeknownst to him — a supervisor came across the car and saw the” firearm, the official said. “He [Maheda] had failed to secure it, and it was just laying there, and that’s when the supervisor saw it and was like, ‘Oh my gosh, I’ve got to get this out of here.’ So the supervisor pulled the gun out. When Lu got back to the vehicle, he saw the shotgun was missing and didn’t realize the supervisor had taken it. So what he did was, he bust the window out, then went back and reported the shotgun stolen.”

A second official who worked with Maheda at the time confirmed the set of events, as did a third.

“He had a longarm go missing from his Border Patrol four-wheel drive so he busted the window out and made a notification that it was stolen, when it was in fact that an agent had just played a joke on him when he left his door unlocked,” said the third person, who also worked in Tucson at the time.

“There was no squirming out of that one. They had him dead to right,” the first official said.

Another source, a union official with secondhand knowledge of the incident, said the supervisor took the gun out of the vehicle to “safeguard” it, not as a joke. Maheda “broke the window and reported it was stolen,” he said.

While DHS does not comment on specific employee personnel actions, a DHS official provided the following information.

""Over 20 years ago, we can confirm that there was an allegation and subsequent full investigation,"" the official said. ""The employee was afforded due process and since then, the employee has had an exemplary record being promoted throughout the ranks without ill effect.""

Maheda was served termination paperwork a day after the incident. He fought the termination with the help of the National Border Patrol Council and kept his job on what the union official described as a “technicality” because he was issued a termination notice on the last day of routine year-long probation period.

The third official with first-hand knowledge of the incident said the move to provide him the termination paperwork the day after may have been intentional because it gave him a way to fight the decision, since the letter should have been served immediately.

“There were all these rumors that his brother, who was a BORTAC (Border Patrol Tactical Unit) agent that was very well thought of — that somebody may have been looking out for the family with that clerical mistake,” the official said.

At the time, Border Patrol agents in their first year could be fired for any reason without being able to appeal the decision or respond to the chief patrol agent’s concerns. A union representative at the time “argued that he was technically no longer on probation because his regular shift had ended before they fired him” and therefore the probation period was technically up, and was able to get an arbitrator to agree, according to the first CBP official. Maheda was reinstated and went to work for the union.

At a certain point in his career at DHS, Maheda began to have ""direct interface"" with McAleenan, who would eventually promote him to his current position.

The third official said Maheda was reprimanded during his work for the internal Border Patrol headquarters division during the 2000s for having “abused travel all over the country basically to install flat screen TVs.”

“He got transferred out of that branch during a bottom-up review that was done by the Border Patrol headquarters staff, led by then Operations Chief Kevin Oaks,” said this source said.

""The United States Border Patrol often conducts reviews and assessments of programs and personnel assignments. During Chief Kevin Oaks’ tenure, the United States Border Patrol restructured several programs and divisions within the Headquarters element, resulting reassignments of multiple personnel and program responsibilities,"" the DHS official said.

The first official described Maheda's promotions as ""one of those things you just keep scratching your head"" over.

“The Department is proud to include a member of the United States Border Patrol within the Department’s Office of Public Affairs,"" said Andrew Meehan, Acting Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs. ""Border Patrol agents have a unique and first-hand knowledge of the impact of the crisis on the southern border and continue to provide thoughtful guidance on how to communicate those challenges to the public.”"

EPA kills proposed Obama-era Pebble mine 'veto',https://thehill.com,[],07-30-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/455368-epa-kills-proposed-obama-era-pebble-mine-veto,"The Environmental Protection Agency announced Tuesday it will reverse an Obama-era decision to block a controversial Alaska mine project.

“After today’s action EPA will focus on the permit review process for the Pebble Mine project” Region 10 Administrator Chris Hladick said in a statement.

“The agency has worked closely with the Army Corps to engage with stakeholders and the public on this issue, which has resulted in an expansive public record, including specific information about the proposed mining project that did not exist in 2014,” Hladick added.

While the EPA is withdrawing the 2014 determination, which it wrote “was issued preemptively and is now outdated,” the withdrawal does not constitute an approval of the permit application or a determination in the permitting process.

“Instead, it allows EPA to continue working with the Corps to review the current permit application and engage in the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) process,” the statement reads.

“Today’s step is a move toward good government decision making, which we owe under the law to both the public and project proponents,” EPA General Counsel Matthew Leopold said in a June statement.

The Obama EPA said the proposed mine would have a harmful effect on streams that feed Bristol Bay, which includes the world’s largest salmon fishery, and in 2018 Pruitt announced the EPA would not seek to do away with the Obama-era decision.

“Until we know the full extent of that risk, those natural resources and world-class fisheries deserve the utmost protection,” Pruitt said at the time."
Former State Dept. analyst says White House is 'undercutting evidence' by blocking climate change warning,https://www.cnn.com,['Devan Cole'],07-30-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/30/politics/state-department-intelligence-official-white-house-climate-change/index.html,"Washington (CNN) A State Department official who quit after he says the White House blocked his written testimony on climate change from being delivered to Congress says the Trump administration is ""undercutting evidence that contradicts its policy positions.""

""I take great pride in the many positive and productive interactions I had with senior officials in my 30 months in the Trump administration,"" Rod Schoonover wrote in a New York Times op-ed published Tuesday. ""But the decision to block the written testimony is another example of a well-established pattern in the Trump administration of undercutting evidence that contradicts its policy positions.""

Last month, the White House office of Legislative Affairs blocked Schoonover, who worked as an intelligence analyst for the department, from submitting written testimony to the House Intelligence Committee that offered major warnings ""on the national security implications of climate change,"" according to a report from The Washington Post citing several senior administration officials.

The written testimony Schoonover was prepared to submit, which warned that human-caused climate change could be ""possibly catastrophic,"" according to the Post, stood in marked contrast to the generally dismissive tone President Donald Trump has taken towards climate change and to recent remarks from Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.

The White House did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment on Tuesday.

Update: Border personnel taking 80 migrants to hospitals daily: DHS official,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-30-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/border-personnel-taking-800-migrants-to-hospitals-daily-dhs-official,"Federal law enforcement assigned to the U.S.-Mexico border are transporting approximately 80 sick migrants in federal custody to hospitals for medical care each day, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection.

Mark Morgan, acting commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, incorrectly told the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Tuesday morning Border Patrol agents and Office of Field Operations officers are transporting ""800"" people daily. A previous version of this story reflected Morgan's mistake.

A CBP spokeswoman who followed up with the Washington Examiner Tuesday afternoon said Morgan ""meant to say 80 people per day on average to the hospital"" after misspeaking during the hearing.

Morgan said the need for transportation, drivers, and law enforcement to stay with migrants while they are in a medical facility has affected the Department of Homeland Security agency's ability to patrol between the ports of entry.

""We are looking at $63 million dollars for continued medical assets and high risk support across the southwest border. That was included in the supplemental,"" Morgan said during a hearing before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Tuesday.

In March, the Washington Examiner reported CBP personnel had spent more than 49,000 hours facilitating medical trips and watching patients while they are in hospitals since January. The loss of agents working in law enforcement roles is equivalent to the 2,000 hours worked by 25 Border Patrol agents in a year.

DHS has diverted $45 million in operational funds to go toward medical costs over the past five years, according to data obtained by the Washington Examiner.

As of March, the U.S. Border Patrol had diverted $9 million in operational funding in fiscal year 2019, as it has done in each of the four previous years, to instead cover medical screenings and related services for thousands of immigrants.

CBP said it had “seen an increase in the numbers of apprehended individuals requiring medical assistance,"" but Morgan did not provide an update to the total number of hospital referrals Tuesday.

Anti-Tech Wave Grows with New Justice Department Antitrust Efforts,https://reason.com,"[""Andrea O'Sullivan"", 'John Stossel', 'Jacob Sullum', 'Alex Muresianu', 'Scott Shackford', 'Gail Heriot', 'Elizabeth Nolan Brown']",07-30-2019,2019,7,https://reason.com/2019/07/30/anti-tech-wave-grows-with-new-justice-department-antitrust-efforts/,"The U.S. is moving against big tech in a big way. Last week, the Department of Justice (DOJ) announced a broad antitrust investigation into whether unnamed technology companies have engaged in anti-competitive activities. This is in addition to DOJ's joint antitrust efforts with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC); DOJ is tackling Apple and Google, while the FTC has Amazon and Facebook. The FTC formed a separate task force to monitor competition in the technology industry earlier this year. Oh yeah, and the House Judiciary Committee is sniffing around for Silicon Valley shenanigans, too.

So far, the DOJ has not named names. Since ""search, social media, and some retail services online"" were specifically mentioned, it's a good bet that Google, Facebook, and Amazon are among the targets. We can probably throw in the Apple App Store, as well.

We also don't know whether the investigations will be voluntary, or if DOJ will exert authority to compel discovery on heretofore unknown dirty deeds. So it's hard to say exactly what DOJ has up its sleeves.

But if the Trump administration's posture towards big tech is any indication, we should expect a fairly aggressive examination of possible anti-competitive actions.

During his nomination hearing, Attorney General Robert Barr stated that he wondered ""how such huge behemoths that now exist in Silicon Valley have taken shape under the nose of the antitrust enforcers"" and advocated for ""vigorous enforcement of the antitrust laws to preserve competition."" In particular, Barr worries that large platforms enjoy network effects so substantial that ""particular sectors could essentially be subsumed into these networks.""

The writing was always on the Facebook Wall. It's true that until fairly recently, most technology companies had something of a neon halo about them. We used and enjoyed social media platforms every day, those harmless and amusing outlets for comradery and cat-posting. Amazon gave us great cheap junk, Apple had the coolest products. Google gave us, well, everything else.

But how the mighty fall. After a few bonkers elections and a mass awakening to just how all those ""free"" services make money, America now calls for tech companies' heads.

It's an illustration of general U.S. attitudes to antitrust. On paper, enforcers like the DOJ and FTC are only supposed to intervene when a firm restricts output and raises prices, or when it possesses an ""essential facility"" available nowhere else. In other words, officials should get involved where consumers are demonstrably harmed, as gauged by measurable economic outcomes like price increases or output restriction.

In practice, however, many call for firms to be broken up anytime we feel they are getting too big. We forget today, but at one point, the hot talk in tech was that MySpace and AOL were due for the antitrust treatment. Today, these names do not conjure images of anti-competitive activity because they were successfully competed against—by Facebook and Google. Yet their actions remain the same.

Under the ""market structure"" conception of antitrust, it's not so much about protecting consumers as it is about protecting competition—that is to say, protecting current and future competitors.

It's hard to argue, for instance, that Windows users were harmed by the free Internet Explorer browser that came preinstalled on their computers. Microsoft's aggressive behind-the-scenes campaign to convince vendors to snub alternative browsers didn't really affect user experience. If you wanted a different browser, you could just use IE to download another browser. But competitors like Netscape clearly were harmed by such structural defaults, which is why DOJ eventually intervened.

Microsoft was big and seemed unassailable. Of course, it wasn't, but not along the dimensions over which '90s antitrust regulators so agonized. The fall came, to regulators at least, out of nowhere: Apple's streamlined strategy and the open source operating system Linux dealt major blows to Microsoft's seemingly untouchable positions in the personal computing (hello, iPhone) and server markets. Browsers were the wrong battle—dirty as the fight may have been for poor Netscape—and today Microsoft browsers are considered a bit of a joke.

In a similar way, successes spelled trouble for tech titans. It was only a matter of time until they got big enough and unpopular enough to draw antitrust scrutiny. It's almost tautological: The most competitive companies in hindsight become the most ""anti-competitive."" (Is there a major company who got there by playing nice?) You can always find something to point to as an unfair and unbreakable barrier to competition.

It doesn't sound great to say you are breaking up firms to benefit other companies. Today, aggressive antitrust enforcement is couched in terms of ""innovation."" It's not that we are shoring up businesses that couldn't keep up. We are taking down today's titans so that they little guys can get a crack at them. With more breathing room, tomorrow's paradigm shifts can sooner take flight today. Some go so far as to claim that without the DOJ's antitrust case tying up Microsoft, Google would have never taken off.

The Justice Department's statements on their investigations hew to this new conception of antitrust as a harbinger of tomorrow's innovation. Its press release singles out practices that have ""reduced competition"" and ""stifled innovation"" for scrutiny. Last on that list, by the way, are activities that ""otherwise harmed consumers.""

We'll have to wait and see what the DOJ will dig up as evidence of anti-competitive behaviors. Perhaps they will discover some truly heinous deeds. Or maybe something fairly benign will be touted as proof that online platforms' gains were ill-gotten, or that their very size is on its face is bad for competition. After all, antitrust regulators will want to come up with something.

They walk a fine line. It's not hard to imagine scenarios where actions that are bad for competitors are also bad for consumers. Let's say Microsoft's browsers blocked users from downloading alternative options. That would clearly limit choice and competition, and would probably stall browser innovation as well. But it's not always the case that what makes competitors' jobs harder makes consumers' lives worse. Regulators should keep the distinctions clear.

The big guys are ready for a fight, and their lawyers are surely fashioning preemptive rebuttals to defend their most notorious business practices from antitrust affronts. It's how the game is played.

Should we expect these antitrust efforts to do much for innovation? If the past is any guide, the Davids that will take down our Goliaths are probably putting together their slingshots as we speak, far from the eyes of antitrust regulators. And then the next decade's Justice Department will puzzle over just how those new giants got where they are in the first place. After all, if they had actionable information on what the next major markets will be, they might be in a different line of work."
"Trump's trip to his Turnberry resort cost the State Department at least $233K, review finds",https://www.cnn.com,['Jennifer Hansler'],07-29-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/29/politics/trump-turnberry-resort-cost-state-department-oig/index.html,"(CNN) The State Department spent at least $233,732 on President Donald Trump's July 2018 trip to his Turnberry resort in Scotland, according to a letter from the department's inspector general obtained by CNN.

The July 22 letter from Inspector General Steve Linick to Democratic Sens. Tom Carper of Delaware and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland details only the costs that were paid by the State Department and not reimbursed. Among the costs were more than $42,000 in overtime, more than $111,000 in hotels, more than $28,000 in rental cars and more than $51,000 in temporary duty costs, according to the letter.

The OIG review was not able to determine how much the resort gained in profit from the visit. The State Department spent $728 on three rooms for two nights at the Trump-owned property. According to the letter, the department said they were used by the US ambassador to the United Kingdom, his wife and his chief of protocol. The department said that the Trump Turnberry's rate was ""the lowest of all the hotels being utilized for this VIP visit"" and offered ""a fair and reasonable rate to the Government,"" according to document cited in the letter.

The Hill was the first to report on Linick's letter.

The State Department OIG review was prompted by a call for investigation made by the three Democratic lawmakers shortly after the President's trip. They also requested an inquiry from the Department of Homeland Security's Office of Inspector General. The department OIG did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment Monday.

US Justice Dept. can't find files on investigation into Rocky Flats nuclear arms plant,https://www.thedenverchannel.com,[],07-30-2019,2019,7,https://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/local-news/us-justice-dept-cant-find-files-on-investigation-into-rocky-flats-nuclear-arms-plant,"DENVER (AP) — The U.S. Department of Justice has lost track of more than 60 boxes of documents from a 27-year-old criminal investigation into safety and environmental violations at a former nuclear weapons plant in Colorado, officials said Tuesday.

The files were gathered in a two-year grand jury probe of the Rocky Flats plant outside Denver, which manufactured plutonium triggers for nuclear warheads and had a history of fires, leaks and spills.

The files have remained secret since the investigation ended with criminal charges in 1992.

Seven groups representing environmentalists, former nuclear workers, nearby residents and public health advocates filed a motion in federal court in January asking that the files be made public. The groups say the documents could show whether the government did enough to clean up the site before turning part of it into a wildlife refuge and opening it to hikers and bicyclists.

Government attorneys are fighting the request.

The U.S. Attorney's Office in Denver told the activists in a July 24 email that it cannot find the files.

Kevin Traskos, chief of the U.S. attorney's civil division in Denver, told The Associated Press on Tuesday that officials have done only an initial search so far. ""The search was preliminary and is continuing,"" he said.

The activists plan to ask a federal judge on Wednesday to order the Justice Department to find the documents within 30 days.

Rocky Flats, perched on a windy plateau about 15 miles (24 kilometers) northwest of downtown Denver, operated from 1952 to 1989. It shut down amid the grand jury investigation.

Rockwell International, the contractor that operated the plant, pleaded guilty to criminal charges that included mishandling chemical and radioactive material. The company was fined $18.5 million.

The government spent $7 billion cleaning up 2 square miles (5 square kilometers) at the center of the site where the plutonium triggers were built. The former buffer zone around the plant, covering 8 square miles (21 square kilometers), became Rocky Flats National Wildlife Refuge and opened to the public last fall.

In a separate case, another group of activists filed a federal lawsuit saying the government did not do enough to make sure the refuge is safe. That lawsuit is pending.

This story has been corrected to show the activists have not yet asked a judge to order the Justice Department to find the files but plan to submit the request Wednesday.

The data came in about the same as the trade expected.

Corn

In 2019, the U.S. farmers planted 91.7 million acres of corn, according to the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS). That equates to roughly 69 million football fields of corn and 3% above last year's acreage, according to NASS estimates.

The overall condition of the corn crop is rated at 58% good to excellent in the top 18 corn producing states, compared to 57% a week ago.

The USDA pegged 58% of the corn crop was in the silk stage, compared with a 83% five-year average.

Also, 13% of the corn has entered the dough stage vs. a 23% five-year average.



Soybeans

The nation’s crop is rated 54% good/excellent, equal to a week ago.

Also, 57% of the soybean crop is blooming vs. a 79% five-year average.

The USDA pegged the amount of soybeans setting pods at 21%, well below a five-year average of 45%.



Wheat

The U.S. winter wheat harvest is 75% complete vs. a 79% five-year average.

Meanwhile, the U.S. spring wheat crop is rated as 76% good to excellent, equal to last week’s rating."
DHS warns of cybersecurity vulnerability in small airplanes,https://thehill.com,[],07-30-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/455319-dhs-warns-of-cybersecurity-vulnerability-in-small-airplanes,"The Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) cybersecurity agency issued a security alert on Tuesday warning of a cyber vulnerability in small aircraft that could enable malicious actors to change key readings on the planes.

The alert was issued after cybersecurity group Rapid7 reported to DHS’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) that an aircraft’s Controller Area Network (CAN) bus system can be exploited by a cyber attacker if the hacker has physical access to the plane.

CISA warned that the hacker could attach a device to the aircraft’s CAN bus system that could “inject false data,” leading to incorrect readings.

Attackers could manipulate the plane’s altitude, airspeed and angle of attack data, CISA noted, adding that pilots would not be able to “distinguish between false and legitimate readings” and could lose control of the airplane.

In order to prevent this type of attack, CISA recommended that aircraft owners restrict physical access to the planes, and that aircraft manufacturers review the implementation of CAN bus networks to increase security.

Rapid7 also put out a paper on its findings on Tuesday, with the group's Patrick Kiley writing that the perception that airplanes are kept in secure environments could be “making them more vulnerable to cyber-attacks, not less.”

Kiley added that “while physical restrictions are great, we really feel like avionics, in particular, need to implement defense-in-depth.”"

Last week, a federal judge in California late blocked the Trump administration's new asylum rule dramatically limiting the ability of Central American migrants to claim asylum if they enter the US by land through Mexico.

The administration also filed an emergency motion in the Northern District Court of California to allow the asylum restrictions to go into effect while the appeal to the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals plays out. The Justice Department asked Judge Jon Tigar to decide whether he would stay his order blocking the rule by Friday.

The move puts yet another of President Donald Trump's immigration policies before the 9th Circuit, which has ruled against some of the President's policies.

The ruling from Tigar, a Barack Obama nominee, came the same day that a federal judge in Washington, DC, an appointee of President Donald Trump, had declined to block the rule. Tigar's decision, which affects the entire country, took precedence.

The investigation found that the business had required noncitizen workers to present immigration documents even when they had other valid documents proving they were authorized to work.

“Employers must not request additional, unnecessary work authorization documents from employees based on their citizenship status,” Assistant Attorney General Eric Dreiband of the DOJ’s Civil Rights Division said in a press release.

AT&T reels in $984M contract with Department of Justice,https://www.fiercetelecom.com,['Mike Robuck'],,,,https://www.fiercetelecom.com/telecom/at-t-reels-984-million-contract-department-justice,"AT&T announced on Monday that it has reeled in a 15-year, $984 million contract with the U.S. Department of Justice.

The deal serves as the long-term foundation for the Department of Justice's network and technology upgrades. The fully managed portfolio of solutions from AT&T includes IP voice, data, security, cloud access and professional services.

Contracts from the General Services Administration's Enterprise Infrastructure Solutions (EIS) program have become a lucrative source for service providers such as AT&T and CenturyLink. EIS gives federal agencies the flexibility and agility to migrate to modern communications and IT services that meet government security standards. Earlier this year, CenturyLink announced it was the first supplier to receive authority to operate under the EIS program.

EIS is GSA's 15-year, $50 billion program that was designed to award various contracts to vendors that help federal agencies to buy and update their IT and telecommunications infrastructure services.

Under the new contract, AT&T will offer the DoJ network function virtualization (NFV), SD-WAN, managed IP voice services and cloud connectivity across the major cloud providers and other capabilities.

AT&T was the incumbent providing DoJ data services under the predecessor procurement program known as “Networx.” The incumbents that were providing voice services to the DoJ under the Networx program were Verizon and CenturyLink.

In the transition to EIS, AT&T will continue to provide data services and adds managed IP voice services. Work on the new contract is underway, according to a spokesman.

The new AT&T solutions will help simplify cloud adoption across 43 component organizations and support the DoJ's Joint Cloud Optimized Trusted Internet Connection Service (JCOTS), which will accelerate the path for DoJ to access multiple cloud environments.

The services and applications will be used across the Justice Department's more than 120,000 employees that are spread across more than 2,100 locations.

The deal also includes access to the AT&T mobility network and FirstNet, which is the nationwide, dedicated communications platform purpose-built for public safety and first responders. As of early May, AT&T FirstNet had more than 600,000 connections, according to a story by FierceWireless.

EPA chief defends biofuel waivers in meeting with farm senators: sources,https://www.reuters.com,"['Humeyra Pamuk', 'Min Read']",07-31-2019,2019,7,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-ethanol-waivers/epa-chief-defends-biofuel-waivers-in-meeting-with-farm-senators-sources-idUSKCN1UP1HC,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency defended his agency’s expanded use of waivers exempting refineries from the country’s biofuel law during a closed-door meeting with farm state senators last week, arguing the program has had no negative impact on ethanol demand, according to four sources with knowledge of the meeting.

EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler’s comments are a sign he may resist an overhaul of the so-called Small Refinery Exemption program, which President Donald Trump last month ordered members of his Cabinet to review based on complaints from the corn lobby. The EPA and the U.S. Department of Agriculture are preparing to hold a cabinet-level meeting on the issue as soon as this week, two of the same sources said.

Under the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard, refineries must blend corn-based ethanol into their gasoline or buy credits from those that do – a policy meant to help farmers and cut U.S. petroleum imports. But small facilities can secure exemptions from the program if they can prove to the EPA that complying would cause them financial hardship.

Since Trump took office, the EPA has more than quadrupled the number of waivers it has granted to refineries, saving the oil industry hundreds of millions of dollars, but enraging farmers who claim the move threatens demand for one of their staple products. Refiners dismiss the argument, saying ethanol demand has not been impacted.

Wheeler echoed the refining industry’s point of view in his meeting last Wednesday with the senators from corn-producing states, which included powerful Republican Chuck Grassley from Iowa, according to the four sources, who asked not to be named.

“We understand Wheeler has made a case that ethanol industry was not hurt by the small refinery waivers,” said one of the sources, an industry official with knowledge of the meeting. Another source said Wheeler attributed the reason behind weak ethanol demand as falling gasoline consumption, not the waiver program.

The EPA said in a statement emailed to Reuters that it “continues to implement the Renewable Fuel Standard program in accordance with the Clean Air Act, taking into consideration additional direction from Congress, recommendations from Department of Energy, and relevant court decisions.”

It did not comment on the meeting.

Renewable fuel (D6) credits for 2019 traded as low as 20 cents each on Tuesday, losing four cents from the previous session following this Reuters report on the meeting, traders said.

The waiver program has been a source of contention between the rivaling corn and oil industries for years now, but the tug of war between the groups has intensified in recent months, underscoring the rising political importance of the RFS policy.

Industry sources told Reuters in recent weeks that decisions on some 40 outstanding waiver applications, covering the 2018 compliance year, were nearly finalized before Trump intervened and demanded the review. Since then, the USDA and EPA have been in talks on how to redesign the waiver program but so far, no definitive solution has emerged.

During a visit to a refinery in Pennsylvania on Tuesday, Wheeler said the agency was still processing them and was hoping to make decisions within the next few weeks, or at most a month.

Some refiners say they filed their applications far earlier than April, and say the EPA is already late.

Past waivers have gone to small refineries owned by giants like Exxon Mobil and Chevron Corp, along with a facility owned by billionaire investor Carl Icahn, according to a report by Reuters. That has raised accusations from the corn lobby that the EPA is misusing the program meant to protect the smallest fuel facilities from going bust."

Bobby Scott says the US Department of Agriculture concealed data showing that its recent proposed changes to the food stamp program could result in more than 500,000 low-income students losing free meals.

In a letter to Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue , Scott, a Virginia Democrat who's the chairman of the House Committee on Education and Labor, writes that the impact on school meal eligibility was not included in the Trump administration's formal proposal revising who qualifies for the food stamp program, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.

Scott writes that ""the proposed rule will impact not only SNAP eligibility, but will also affect children's eligibility for school meal programs."" The program, Scott noted, ""allows schools to provide free meals to all students in high-poverty communities.""

The congressman writes that his committee's staff learned about the impact on school lunches in a phone briefing with USDA staff and requested that the department revise its proposal to include the estimate and restart the 60-day comment period.

He notes the USDA is required by law to include ""relevant scientific and technical findings"" in proposed rules and says the effect on school meals is an ""important technical finding that must be made public.""

Homeland Security issues hacking security alert for small planes,https://kdvr.com,['Dara Bitler'],07-30-2019,2019,7,https://kdvr.com/2019/07/30/homeland-security-issues-hacking-security-alert-for-small-planes/,"× Homeland Security issues hacking security alert for small planes

WASHINGTON— The Department of Homeland Security issued a security alert Tuesday for small planes, warning that modern flight systems are vulnerable to hacking if someone manages to gain physical access to the aircraft.

An alert from the DHS critical infrastructure computer emergency response tea m recommends that plane owners ensure they restrict unauthorized physical access to their aircraft until the industry develops safeguards to address the issue, which was discovered by a Boston-based cybersecurity company and reported to the federal government.

Most airports have security in place to restrict unauthorized access and there is no evidence that anyone has exploited the vulnerability. But a DHS official told The Associated Press that the agency independently confirmed the security flaw with outside partners and a national research laboratory, and decided it was necessary to issue the warning.

The cybersecurity firm, Rapid7, found that an attacker could potentially disrupt electronic messages transmitted across a small plane’s network, for example by attaching a small device to its wiring, that would affect aircraft systems.

Engine readings, compass data, altitude and other readings “could all be manipulated to provide false measurements to the pilot,” according to the DHS alert.

The warning reflects the fact that aircraft systems are increasingly reliant on networked communications systems, much like modern cars. The auto industry has already taken steps to address similar concerns after researchers exposed vulnerabilities.

The Rapid7 report focused only on small aircraft because their systems are easier for researchers to acquire. Large aircraft frequently use more complex systems and must meet additional security requirements. The DHS alert does not apply to older small planes with mechanical control systems.

But Patrick Kiley, Rapid7’s lead researcher on the issue, said an attacker could exploit the vulnerability with access to a plane or by bypassing airport security.

“Someone with five minutes and a set of lock picks can gain access (or) there’s easily access through the engine compartment,” Kiley said.

Jeffrey Troy, president of the Aviation Information Sharing and Analysis Center, an industry organization for cybersecurity information, said there is a need to improve the security in networked operating systems but emphasized that the hack depends on bypassing physical security controls mandated by law.

With access, “you have hundreds of possibilities to disrupt any system or part of an aircraft,” Troy said.

The Federal Aviation Administration said in a statement that a scenario where someone has unrestricted physical access is unlikely, but the report is also “an important reminder to remain vigilant” about physical and cybersecurity aircraft procedures.

Aviation cybersecurity has been an issue of growing concern around the world.

In March, the U.S. Department of Transportation’s inspector general found that the FAA had “not completed a comprehensive, strategy policy framework to identify and mitigate cybersecurity risks.” The FAA agreed and said it would look to have a plan in place by the end of September.

The UN’s body for aviation proposed its first strategy for securing civil aviation from hackers that’s expected to go before the General Assembly in September, said Pete Cooper, an ex-Royal Air Force fast jet pilot and cyber operations officer who advises the aviation industry.

The vulnerability disclosure report is the product of nearly two years of work by Rapid7. After their researchers assessed the flaw, the company alerted DHS. Tuesday’s DHS alert recommends manufacturers review how they implement these open electronics systems known as “the CAN bus” to limit a hacker’s ability to perform such an attack.

The CAN bus functions like a small plane’s central nervous system. Targeting it could allow an attacker to stealthily hijack a pilot’s instrument readings or even take control of the plane, according to the Rapid7 report obtained by The AP.

“CAN bus is completely insecure,” said Chris King, a cybersecurity expert who has worked on vulnerability analysis of large-scale systems. “It was never designed to be in an adversarial environment, (so there’s) no validation” that what the system is being told to do is coming from a legitimate source.

Only a few years ago, most auto manufacturers used the open CAN bus system in their cars. But after researchers publicly demonstrated how they could be hacked, auto manufacturers added on layers of security, like putting critical functions on separate networks that are harder to access externally.

The disclosure highlights issues in the automotive and aviation industries about whether a software vulnerability should be treated like a safety defect — with its potential for costly manufacturer recalls and implied liability — and what responsibility manufacturers should have in ensuring their products are hardened against such attacks. The vulnerability also highlights the reality that it’s becoming increasingly difficult to separate cybersecurity from security overall.

“A lot of aviation folks don’t see the overlap between information security, cybersecurity, of an aircraft, and safety,” said Beau Woods, a cyber safety innovation fellow with the Atlantic Council, a Washington think tank. “They see them as distinct things.”

The CAN bus networking scheme was developed in the 1980s and is extremely popular for use in boats, drones, spacecraft, planes and cars — all areas where there’s more noise interference and it’s advantageous to have less wiring. It’s actually increasingly used in airplanes today due to the ease and cost of implementation, Kiley said.

Given that airplanes have a longer manufacturing cycle, “what we’re trying to do is get out ahead of this.”

The report didn’t name the vendors Rapid7 tested, but the company alerted them over a year ago, the report states."
Devin Nunes says 3 groups need to be examined to understand origins of Trump-Russia 'cover-up',https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-28-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/devin-nunes-says-3-groups-need-to-be-examined-to-understand-origins-of-trump-russia-cover-up,"Republican California Rep. Devin Nunes said there are three known groups that need to be examined to understand fully the origins of the Trump-Russia investigation.

During an interview Sunday on Fox News, the top Republican said the Justice Department, which is conducting a so-called investigation into the investigators, needs to determine the intersection of the FBI, Hillary Clinton's campaign and Fusion GPS, and a group of people at Cambridge University in London.

“Those are the three entities that we know,"" Nunes told host Maria Bartiromo on Sunday Morning Futures. ""What the DOJ needs to get to the bottom of is, when did these all intersect? You don’t get that until you start to interview people and remember the Mueller team never bothered to interview many of these folks.""

Former special counsel Robert Mueller concluded his investigation earlier this year and was unable to find sufficient evidence to establish criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia. GOP investigators, such as Nunes, want to know when Mueller knew there was no coordination in his 22-month-long investigation. They also are concerned the FBI has not been forthcoming in its assertion that the counterintelligence into President Trump's campaign in July 2016, after Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos told an Australian diplomat Alexander Downer he heard the Russian has damaging information on Clinton.

Papadopoulos was allegedly told about this Clinton ""dirt"" by the mysterious Maltese academic Joseph Mifsud, whom Mueller admitted in his report had lied to investigators yet was never charged.

""Mifsud is at the heart of the investigation. Mifsud is the one who supposedly knows about Clinton’s emails — that the Russians have Clinton emails. He supposedly said this to Papadopoulos, something about emails,"" Nunes said.

Nunes said that the Mifsud-Papadopoulos-Downer communications were ""the documented reason why they opened the investigation on July 31, 2016,"" but said that ""it is clear"" that the FBI was ramping up its inquiry earlier.

""What we’re trying to figure out is when did the FBI really start to run the investigation? What sort of processes did they use? What was the predicate?"" Nunes asked. ""It really appears like they were spying on the Trump campaign.""

Nunes said another key issue for Attorney General William Barr and U.S. Attorney John Durham to examine in their review of the Russia investigation origins is the role played by the dossier written by British ex-spy Christopher Steele.

The dossier contained a litany of unverified claims about Trump's ties to Russia and was used extensively in the FBI's Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act applications before the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to justify surveillance of former Trump campaign associate Carter Page, an American citizen who was never charged with any wrongdoing. Steele compiled the dossier while he was hired by the opposition research firm Fusion GPS, which itself was being funded by Clinton's campaign and the Democratic National Committee.

While possible misuse of the Steele dossier in the FISA Court is the subject of an investigation by Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz, whose report is expected to be released in September, the Barr-Durham review could follow up with prosecutorial action.

Stymieing his own efforts to inspect what the FBI was doing before July 2016, Nunes said the bureau has resisted handing over documents that he stresses he has a right to view under the purview of congressional oversight. Using his nickname for Mueller's team, the ""Mueller dossier team,"" Nunes said the Justice Department ""needs to look at these characters that were on Mueller’s team. I think they obstructed justice. They obstructed a congressional investigation.""

Beyond the FBI, the Clinton campaign, and Fusion GPS, Nunes said ""these intelligence-related folks"" at Cambridge University need to be placed under scrutiny. He name-dropped Steven Schrage, an American citizen who helped organize a symposium in July 2016, which would be before the FBI's counterintelligence operation officially began. During Mueller's testimony last week, the California congressman asked the former special counsel to confirm whether his office did not investigate who was responsible for inviting Trump campaign associates Page and Stephen Miller to this symposium. Mueller declined to answer.

Nunes was by Bartiromo prompted to speak about efforts by possible U.S. informants to ""entrap"" people tied to Trump campaign, including a $10,000 payment to Papadopoulos in 2017 during Mueller's investigation just before he was arrested by the FBI, and contacts between Cambridge University figures and former national security adviser Michael Flynn that date back years before the 2016 election.

Back in 2014, Flynn met Russian-British graduate student Svetlana Lokhova during a trip to the University of Cambridge. Flynn was director of the Defense Intelligence Agency at the time. Reports came out in 2017 that said spy officials had concerns about Flynn's ties to Russians, including his encounter with Lokhova. Flynn's spokesman said the meeting was ""incidental"" and Lokhova told Fox News last year she is ""not a Russia spy"" and said she believes Flynn ""was targeted and I was used to do it."" The dinner at which they met was set up by a United Kingdom academic group that included Cambridge academic Stefan Halper, an FBI informant who was later sent to make contact with members of Trump's campaign.

Nunes said ""none of this makes any sense"" because Mueller's unredacted report does not touch on any of this, but has an intent focus on the infamous June 2016 Trump Tower meeting between members of Trump's inner circle, including his son Donald Trump Jr. and Natalia Veselnitskaya, an attorney with ties to the Kremlin who had predicated the meetup with the promise of dirt on Clinton.

Nunes said opposition research firm Fusion GPS had very suspicious activity surrounding the June 2016 meeting, including its co-founder Glenn Simpson meeting with Veselnitskaya multiple times. NBC News reported in November 2017 that Veselnitskaya said she received incriminating information on Democrats from Simpson, who had worked with her on a case involving money laundering by a Russian company. A lawyer for Fusion GPS said at the time the firm’s work on the Trump dossier was separate from the money laundering case and that the firm was unaware of the Trump Tower meeting when it happened.

But details on Fusion GPS was left out of Mueller's unredacted 448-page report, obliquely referenced only in a footnote. In fact, Mueller, who at times appeared to be unfamiliar with his own report, said during his testimony he was ""not familiar"" with Fusion GPS.

""This is nothing more, nothing less than a cover-up,"" Nunes said Sunday."

ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. — When President Donald Trump drew widespread condemnation for describing a majority-black congressional district as a ""rat and rodent infested mess"" and for tweets targeting four Democratic congresswomen of color, it was not the first time a U.S. president attracted such attention.

Throughout American history, presidents have uttered comments, issued decisions and made public and private moves that critics said were racist, either at the time or in later generations. The presidents did so both before taking office and during their time in the White House.

Many of the early presidents, George Washington to Zachary Taylor, owned black slaves and held power when African Americans, Native Americans and Latinos did not have the right to vote or serve on juries and could be refused service in public accommodations. They often repeated commonly held racist views, even when challenged by scholars or civil rights leaders.

Before he became the nation's third president, Thomas Jefferson wrote in the Declaration of Independence that ""all men are created equal."" But in his only book, ""Notes on the State of Virginia,"" published in 1785, the future president expressed a series of beliefs about African Americans that would be seen today as racist.

This Feb. 17, 2016 file photo shows statue of Thomas Jefferson greeting visitors in the main lobby of the Jefferson Hotel in Richmond, Va. (Photo: Steve Helber, AP)

He wrote that blacks were cursed with ""a very strong and disagreeable odor"" and were incapable of producing art and poetry. And though he said he believed slavery was immoral, he owned slaves and, historians say, carried on a sexual relationship with at least one of them, Sally Hemings. If every black slave were ever freed, he wrote, they should be deported since he believed blacks and whites could not live together peacefully.

Andrew Jackson, the nation's seventh president, was also a slaveholder from the South. Before he became president, he offered in an 1804 advertisement $50 for the return of a runaway slave and $10 extra ""for every hundred lashes any person will give him, to the amount of 300."" In Jon Meacham's 2008 book ""American Lion: Andrew Jackson and the White House,"" Meacham wrote that Jackson owned around 150 slaves and freed none in his will.

As president, Jackson allowed his postmaster general to let Southerners seize anti-slavery publications in direct violation of the First Amendment. He called the abolitionist pamphlets urging black equality ""unconstitutional and wicked.""

Jackson is widely vilified today among Native Americans for his role in forcibly removing indigenous people from their land, especially for the Trail of Tears. The removal of the Cherokee people from Georgia led to thousands of deaths.

""The philanthropist will rejoice that the remnant of that ill-fated race has been at length placed beyond the reach of injury or oppression,"" Jackson said in his farewell address.

The Virginia-born Woodrow Wilson worked to keep blacks out of Princeton University while serving as that school's president. When he became president of the U.S., the Democrat refused to reverse the segregation of civil service, though he had won the White House with the support for some African American men.

In 1915, Wilson sparked outrage by screening the racist film ""The Birth of a Nation"" at the White House. The silent movie was the retelling of Reconstruction through the eyes of the Ku Klux Klan. The movie portrayed the KKK as heroes and African Americans as uncivilized.

""No explanation or apology followed"" after the screening, Patty O'Toole wrote in ""The Moralist: Woodrow Wilson and the World He Made.""

In this 1916 file photo, President Woodrow Wilson throws out the first ball at a baseball game in Washington. (Photo: AP)

Wilson appeared oblivious during the ""Red Summer"" of 1919 — a time when communities across the country saw white mobs attack African Americans, resulting in hundreds of deaths. He spoke out against lynching but did not use the federal government's resources to stop the violence.

Democrat Lyndon Johnson assumed the presidency in 1963 after the assassination of John F. Kennedy and sought to push a civil rights bill amid demonstrations by African Americans. Johnson famously convinced skeptical lawmakers to support the measure and gave a passionate speech about his days as a teacher in Mexican American schools to urge Congress to pass the Voting Rights Act.

But according to tapes of his private conversations, Johnson routinely used racist epithets to describe African Americans and some blacks he appointed to key positions.

Johnson, left, munching on a cookie, and George Meany, president of the AFL-CIO, laugh at a speaker's remark during the first annual Jewish Labor Committee Human Rights Awards dinner at the Sheraton in New York City.

His successor, Republican Richard Nixon, also regularly used racist epithets while in office in private conversations.

""We're going to (place) more of these little Negro bastards on the welfare rolls at $2,400 a family,"" Nixon once said about what he saw as lax work requirements. Nixon also made derogatory remarks about Jews, Mexican Americans, Italian Americans and Irish Americans.

The $100 million civil suit, which the Department of Justice filed in the Northern District of California, targets BTC-e for offering services to US residents without abiding by US financial regulations, including declining to register with FinCEN as a Money Services Business, failing to establish anti-money laundering procedures as stipulated under the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), and failing to report suspicious activities.

From the complaint:

“At no point in time did BTC-e have any AML policies or procedures, let alone an effective program for detecting and preventing suspicious transactions. To the contrary, BTC-e’s lax policies encouraged persons engaged in criminal activity to use its services, and BTC-e became the virtual currency exchange of choice for criminals looking to launder their illegal proceeds.”

FinCEN had levied $88.6 million in penalties against BTC-e and $12 million in penalties against Vinnik, and the DOJ says that the lawsuit intends to “enforce” those fines.

Former public defender: DOJ plan to resume federal executions a 'recipe for problems',https://thehill.com,[],07-29-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/hilltv/rising/455140-former-public-defender-trumps-plan-to-resume-federal-executions-is-recipe-for-problems,"Former public defender Robert Dunham on Monday said that the Trump administration’s plan to resume federal executions after nearly two decades is a “recipe for problems,” saying that such a move could catch some authorities unprepared if anything goes wrong.

“What we’ve seen is that there’s been 15 years of no executions,” Dunham, now the executive director of the nonprofit Death Penalty Information Center, said in an appearance on Hill.TV.

“Now you’re going to carry out five executions in the span of five weeks, three executions in the span of five days with personnel that have not carried out any executions at all,” he continued. “That particular compressed schedule if it goes forward is a recipe for problems.”

Dunham explained that federal authorities carrying out the executions need to be properly trained.

“These are going to be the first executions, so you know they’re going to be legal challenges — they frequently go on until the last minute and so you’ve got potentially unprepared personnel facing a situation that none of them has faced in a period of 15 years,” he told Hill.TV.

The Justice Department announced last week that it plans to reinstate the federal death penalty, beginning with the executions of death-row inmates later this year. All five of the inmates that Attorney General William Barr William Pelham BarrUN: Trump administration 'rolling back progress' with death penalty decision Rising star Ratcliffe faces battle to become Trump's intel chief Former Virginia deputy AG: Trump's Twitter attacks a 'distraction' from 'substantive' critiques MORE named in his release were convicted for the murders of children.

“The Justice Department upholds the rule of law — and we owe it to the victims and their families to carry forward the sentence imposed by our justice system,” Barr’s statement read in part.

Dunham, meanwhile, cast doubt over whether the executions, which are scheduled for December 2019 and January 2020, will actually move forward.

“In the statement last week, Attorney General Barr said he was directing the bureau of prisons to adopt a new protocol, which is going to be a single drug — pentobarbital — the same drug that’s used in Texas and Georgia and Missouri,” he said.

“But the difficulty as a legal matter is you can’t say this is our new protocol, you have to go through the rule-making process,” he added.

Dunham said this compressed system doesn’t allow for “meaningful consideration” for ensuring whether the drugs were obtained legally by a drug company with the appropriate health and safety records.

“If you’re going to have a death penalty — the ultimate in the law — I think it’s critical that we follow the law,” he told Hill.TV.

Barr's announcement comes as the number of executions in the U.S. has declined over the last decade.

According to a report by the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics, the number of death-row inmates had fallen for the 17th consecutive year in 2017.

It also comes amid concerns about whether capital punishment disproportionately impacts African Americans. Dunham said there is still a disproportionate number of people of color who are on death rows around the country, saying this discrimination generally happens in two stages.

“The first is who gets capitally prosecuted — what kind of case and there we see a ‘victim preference if you will’ and that’s where you get the argument that black lives don’t matter because you are much more likely to be capitally prosecuted if you’ve committed an offense against a white person and particularly against a white woman.”

A number of 2020 Democratic presidential candidates have spoken out against the Justice Department’s plan.

“Let me be clear: capital punishment is immoral and deeply flawed. Too many innocent people have been put to death,” Sen.

Acting DHS boss McAleenan praises Supreme Court 'victory' sanctioning use of Pentagon funds for border wall,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Frank Miles', 'Frank Miles Is A Reporter', 'Editor Covering Geopolitics', 'Military', 'Crime', 'Technology', 'Sports For Foxnews.Com. His Email Is Frank.Miles Foxnews.Com.']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/kevin-mcaleenan-dhs-supreme-court-victory-pentagon-funds-border-wall,"Kevin McAleenan, the acting Homeland Security secretary, told Fox News on Sunday it's a “big victory” that the Supreme Court cleared the way for the Trump administration to tap billions of dollars in Pentagon funds to build sections of a border wall with Mexico.

“There was a big victory at the Supreme Court to allow the Department of Defense to move forward with that $2.5 billion to really accelerate the progress on the wall, and kind of double what we're doing with the congressionally appropriated funding, which is going well, as you noted up to 54 miles since we talked,” he told Maria Bartiromo on “Sunday Morning Futures.”

The court’s five conservative justices gave the administration the green light on Friday to begin work on four contracts it has awarded using Defense Department money. Lower courts had frozen funding for the projects while a lawsuit over the money proceeded. The court’s four liberal justices wouldn’t have allowed construction to start.

The Supreme Court’s action reversed the decision of a trial court, which initially froze the funds in May, and an appeals court, which kept that freeze in place earlier this month. The freeze had prevented the government from tapping approximately $2.5 billion in Pentagon money to replace existing sections of barrier in Arizona, California and New Mexico with more robust fencing.

The case in which the Supreme Court ruled began after the 35-day partial government shutdown that started in December of last year. The shutdown ended in February after Congress approved approximately $1.4 billion in border wall funding, but the amount was far less than the $5.7 billion Presiden Trump was seeking. The president then declared a national emergency to take cash from other government accounts to use to construct sections of wall.

KIDNAPPED AUSTRIAN TRIATHLETE SWEET-TALKS CAPTOR INTO LETTING HER GO: REPORT

The money Trump identified included $3.6 billion from military construction funds, $2.5 billion in Defense Department money and $600 million from the Treasury Department’s asset forfeiture fund.

The case before the Supreme Court involved just the $2.5 billion in Defense Department funds, which the administration said would be used to build more than 100 miles of fencing.

One project would replace 46 miles of barrier in New Mexico for $789 million. Another would replace 63 miles in Arizona for $646 million. The other two projects in California and Arizona were smaller.

The other funds were not at issue in the case. The Treasury Department funds so far have survived legal challenges, and Customs and Border Protection has earmarked the money for work in Texas’ Rio Grande Valley but has not yet awarded contracts. Transfer of the $3.6 billion in military construction funds was awaiting approval from the defense secretary.

McAleenan told Bartiromo that “building every day down there in the border … that's already providing significant new operational capability, and helping us control some high traffic areas of the border.”

He said that he did believe the situation at the border has been improving by “almost every measure,” but the only way to eradicate the immigration crisis completely would be through congressional action.

Who's afraid of cryptocurrencies? Everyone in Washington,https://www.dallasnews.com,"['Stephen Moore', 'Connect With Stephen Moore']",07-28-2019,2019,7,https://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/commentary/2019/07/28/afraid-cryptocurrencies-everyone-washington,"What is everyone so afraid of? The one word answer is: competition. Cryptocurrencies challenge the state's strangle-hold monopoly over fiat money. This could diminish the authoritative powers of arrogant and fallible central banks.

Before refuting some of these concerns, for full disclosure I should note that I recently became an investor and economic consultant with Decentral, a California-based crypto that will tie its currency to the dollar.

Cryptos will provide a ""private option"" alternative to government money. They are hedges against inflation. and they can execute global blockchain transactions much more swiftly and at lower costs than using government money.

The claim that these currencies will be used by drug runners, money launderers and tax cheats is certainly legitimate. But this is like saying that automobiles should have been outlawed because they were used as getaway vehicles for criminals like Bonnie and Clyde. Almost any new technology can be used for good or evil. There are many legitimate reasons that hundreds of millions of law-abiding citizens worldwide would want financial privacy from government. They shouldn't be suspected of criminal activity simply because they want that right.

What is laughable is the claim that cryptos risk causing financial panics. Wait a minute. The Fed and other central banks and government financial regulators have done a pretty good job of whirling up crises on their own. Nearly every recession and depression of the last century can be traced to government mistakes, and often by the self-proclaimed oracles at the Fed.

Governments in the U.S. and around the world have amassed tens and even hundreds of trillions of dollars of debts and unfunded liabilities. It's hardly paranoid to think politicians will eventually try to inflate their way out of these debts.

Cryptos are a check and balance against currency debauchery.

This revolution in what we call money is coming one way or the other and the unprepared regulatory regimes will mostly delay and complicate, or may send the activity underground. The more these products are resisted, the more it is likely to drive up demand for private money alternatives. Just look at the big gains in Bitcoin in recent months.

Congress and the regulators should let this new exciting digital technology proliferate. No one knows whether Libra, Decentral, Bitcoin or other private competitors will win out. But as Ralph Benko, formerly with the Chamber of Digital Commerce, has pointed out: ""What would have happened to American technological dominance if regulators had snuffed out Google, Amazon, Facebook, Netflix?""

These companies would have been stillborn and Google might have emerged in Switzerland, Facebook in Singapore, Amazon in Israel. This would only weaken America's technological superiority and hurt the dollar, not save it. Besides, who is a greater threat to our liberties and American economic prosperity? Mark Zuckerberg or Rep. Maxine Waters?

New timeline emerges for DOJ inspector general report on FISA abuse,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-27-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/new-timeline-emerges-for-doj-inspector-general-report-on-fisa-abuse,"A new timeline has emerged in recent days for Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz's investigation into alleged surveillance abuses by the DOJ and the FBI.

Whereas Attorney General William Barr predicted earlier this year that the watchdog's investigation would be finished by May or early June, now lawmakers are pointing to the early fall.

Rep. Doug Collins, the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, told Maria Bartiromo on Fox News' Sunday Morning Futures that he “expects that report later this fall.”

His colleague John Ratcliffe, who has spoken to Horowitz, gave a more specific target. The Texas congressman told Fox News' Bret Baier on Wednesday, ""I think that we will get the IG's report probably sometime right after Labor Day."" Labor Day is Sept. 2.

Further solidifying the prediction was a RealClearInvestigations report about former FBI Director James Comey having an inside man at the White House, feeding the bureau information about President Trump and his aides in 2017. That report also set a release date sometime in September.

The delay in Horowitz's work was reportedly due to his team's two-day meeting with Steele in person in London in early June, during President Trump’s state visit to the United Kingdom. Investigators found Steele's information credible enough to warrant extending their investigation.

Horowitz launched an investigation in March 2018 into whether the FBI and the Justice Department filing of four Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act applications and renewals beginning in October 2016 to surveil former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page was an abuse of the FISA process. The applications relied heavily upon the unverified dossier compiled by Steele, who was hired by Fusion GPS. The opposition research firm was hired by Marc Elias of the Perkins Coie law firm at the behest of the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign. Steele's Democratic benefactors were not revealed to the FISA Court.

Meanwhile Barr's ""investigation into the investigators"" is underway, and the attorney general has said he is working very closely with Horowitz. The inspector general can recommend prosecutions, and U.S. Attorney John Durham, whom Barr tasked to lead the review, has the ability to convene a grand jury and subpoena people outside of the government. Beyond that, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, a close Trump ally, has promised a ""deep dive"" into the origins of the Trump-Russia investigation after Horowitz completes his work.

Stay tuned to the Washington Examiner this weekend for closer look at what to expect from Horowitz's report."
U.S. Presidents Relied on This Innovative Alarm Watch,https://gearpatrol.com,['Zen Love'],07-30-2019,2019,7,https://gearpatrol.com/2019/07/30/watches-you-should-know-vulcain-cricket/,"Welcome to “Watches You Should Know,” a bi-weekly (the once-every-two-weeks kind) column highlighting little-known or notable watches new and old that have interesting stories or have had a surprising impact on the industry.

It’s hard to imagine today that the rattly buzzing sound of a mechanical wristwatch alarm was once cutting-edge gadgetry. This was in the 1940s, however, and when the Vulcain Cricket was introduced, it overcame a number of technical hurdles to be loud enough, compact enough, and reliable enough to be a viable product. The first of its kind, an alarm was a genuinely useful function to have on the wrist. So much so that it found fame and took on a whole other level of status after being worn by multiple US presidents and becoming known as the “president’s watch.”

Firsts in watchmaking are always notable, but almost always require some qualification. The utility of an alarm on one’s wrist was recognized long before the Cricket, and a couple companies had produced alarm watches, but each had fatal flaws with alarms that weren’t loud enough or vibrations that adversely affected the movement. The Vulcain Cricket was not technically the first alarm watch when it was introduced in 1947, but the first to be practically successful (pocket watches notwithstanding).

Vulcain had to develop a special movement with multiple unique features in order to make the Cricket viable, let alone interesting and cool. The Caliber 120 featured one mainspring barrel to power timekeeping, as most mechanical wristwatches do, but also a separate one solely for the alarm due to its heavier power demands. The hand-wound movement offered 42 hours of power reserve for the timekeeping, and allowed the alarm to sound for around 25 seconds. Particularly clever is how clean and simple the watch remained despite its complex functionality: turn the crown one direction to wind the time’s mainspring and the other direction to wind the alarm’s mainspring.

The volume needed to be at least sufficient to wake you up, and this was achieved with a combination of solutions. The sound itself comes from a tiny hammer striking a metal “membrane.” It is then amplified via a cover which fits over the movement and, to let the sound resonate and escape, the case back is acoustically designed with holes similar to those seen in some string instruments. The hammer strikes around 1,300 times in the roughly 25 seconds of its loud, continuous ring until it audibly winds down — and it further vibrates palpably on the wrist.

All this results in a watch that looks pretty traditional, with only the addition of another hand on the dial for the alarm and a pusher at 2 o’clock that distinguishes it from time-only watches. The pusher is used to activate the alarm, stop it (important), and put the watch into alarm setting mode. One notable caveat is that the alarm can be set in ten-minute increments, but not down to an exact, individual minute.

The Cricket was successful and was followed by other notable alarm watches like the Jaeger-LeCoultre Memovox and the Tudor Advisor. The Cricket itself also evolved with additional functions and more versions. One of the most notable such Vulcain watches was the Cricket Nautical released in 1961, a dive watch rated to 300m with an alarm that would be audible to the wearer underwater.

The office of president of the United States is full of rituals and traditions, and Vulcain was lucky enough to become part of one. After the White House Press Photographer’s Association chose a Cricket to gift Harry S. Truman a 14k gold Cricket in 1953 as he was leaving office, the alarm watch continued to be associated with US presidents. Vulcain has been clever enough to send Cricket watches to US presidents as well, but this wasn’t a simple case of product placement — Nixon, it is said, got his as a gift from the National Association of Watch and Clock Collectors.

Lyndon B. Johnson clearly appreciated fine watches, as he is associated with both the Cricket and the other famous “president’s watch,” the Rolex Day Date. Johnson bought his Cricket himself in Geneva, the story goes, and had his initials, LBJ, put right on the dial. He later also bought 200 Cricket watches in bulk to give out as gifts during his time in office. There are (unsubstantiated) stories that the sound would alarm his security detail, and that he would set it to go off during meetings as an excuse to leave early. Up to the present day, presidents have been known to receive Cricket watches whether or not they are worn.

If these interesting features and stories weren’t enough to make the Cricket downright legendary, it was also the watch chosen by notable adventurers and mountain climbers. The modern Vulcain company, restarted in 2001 after the original company succumbed to the Quartz Crisis, boasts that the original Cricket’s assembly line survives. Modern versions are available today in various forms, some quite faithful to early models, and they represent a very rare current example of a mechanical alarm in a wristwatch."
"Barr Changes Asylum Rules, Limits Family Endangerment Claims",https://www.wbur.org,['Richard Gonzales'],,,,https://www.wbur.org/npr/746448090/barr-changes-asylum-rules-limits-family-endangerment-claims,"Attorney General William Barr ruled Monday that immigrants fearing persecution because of threats against their family members are no longer eligible for asylum.

The case involves a Mexican man (identified as ""L-E-A"" in court documents) who sought asylum after his family was threatened because his father did not allow drug cartel dealers to use his store for business. That fear of endangerment traditionally has been the basis for legally recognizable claims for asylum.

Under U.S. law, an asylum-seeker must prove a well-founded fear of persecution based on religion, race, nationality, political opinion or membership in a specific social group.

Barr, under his authority to oversee immigration court rulings, reversed a decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals that found the Mexican man's family was a recognizable social group. Ultimately, the BIA did not approve the man's asylum application because it did not recognize the necessary connection between his membership in the group and the alleged persecution.

Barr said the BIA was correct in rejecting the asylum claim, but ""the portion of the BIA's decision recognizing the respondent's proposed particular social group is overruled.""

""Further, as almost every alien is a member of a family of some kind, categorically recognizing families as particular social groups would render virtually every alien a member of a particular social group. There is no evidence that Congress intended the term 'particular social group' to cast so wide a net,"" Barr wrote.

However, Barr wrote that his decision does not disqualify all family-based social groups because there are some societies in which clans or sub-clans are socially distinct.

""I conclude that an alien's family-based group will not constitute a particular social group unless it has been shown to be socially distinct in the eyes of its society, not just those of its alleged persecutor,"" he wrote.

Immigrant advocates say Barr's decision is only the latest move by the Trump administration to restrict asylum.

Earlier this month, the American Civil Liberties Union and other groups challenged new restrictions sought by the administration requiring immigrants who travel through another country before reaching the United States to seek refuge elsewhere or be ineligible for asylum. A federal judge in San Francisco has temporarily blocked that rule.

The Barr decision also runs up against legal precedent, according to some advocates.

""It's a significant declaration of power from the A.G. and one that will hopefully take a beating in court,"" tweeted Aaron Reichlin-Melnick of the American Immigration Council.

DOJ’s Russia probe review focusing on 'smoking gun' tapes of meeting with Trump aide: sources,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Brooke Singman', 'Brooke Singman Is A Politics Reporter For Fox News. Follow Her On Twitter At']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dojs-russia-probe-review-focusing-on-tapes-of-talks-with-trump-aide-sources,"The Justice Department’s internal review of the Russia investigation is zeroing in on transcripts of recordings made by at least one government source who met with former Trump campaign aide George Papadopoulos overseas in 2016, specifically looking at why certain ""exculpatory"" material from them was not presented in subsequent applications for surveillance warrants, according to two sources familiar with the review.

The sources also said the review is taking a closer look at the actual start date of the original FBI investigation into potential collusion between members of the Trump campaign and the Russians, as some allege the probe began earlier than thought. Both components are considered key in the review currently being led by Attorney General Bill Barr and U.S. Attorney from Connecticut John Durham -- an effort sure to draw more attention in the coming weeks and months now that Robert Mueller's testimony is in the rearview.

REPUBLICANS CONFRONT MUELLER WITH ALLEGATIONS OF DOUBLE STANDARD IN RUSSIA PROBE

The recordings in question pertain to conversations between government sources and Papadopoulos, which were memorialized in transcripts. One source told Fox News that Barr and Durham are reviewing why the material was left out of applications to surveil another former Trump campaign aide, Carter Page.

“I think it’s the smoking gun,” the source said.

“These recordings have exculpatory evidence,” the other source added. “It is standard tradecraft to record conversations with someone like Papadopoulos—especially when they are overseas and there are no restrictions.”

Prior to the 2016 presidential election, Papadopoulos met with Maltese professor Joseph Mifsud in London, who told him that the Russians had dirt in the form of emails that could damage Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign. Papadopoulos then told Australian diplomat Alexander Downer of the new information. Downer reported Papadopoulos’ comments to him to the FBI.

A source told Fox News that the ""exculpatory evidence"" included in the transcripts is Papadopoulos denying having any contact with the Russians to obtain the supposed ""dirt"" on Clinton.

But Papadopoulos did not only meet with Mifsud and Downer while overseas. He met with Cambridge professor and longtime FBI informant Stefan Halper and his female associate, who went under the alias Azra Turk. Papadopoulos told Fox News that he saw Turk three times in London: once over drinks, once over dinner and once with Halper. He also told Fox News back in May that he always suspected he was being recorded. Further, he tweeted during the Mueller testimony about ""recordings"" of his meeting with Downer.

It is unclear, at this point, which of these individuals may have recorded conversations with Papadopoulos.

Former Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., now a Fox News contributor, first signaled the existence of transcripts of secretly recorded conversations between FBI informants and Papadopoulos earlier this year.

“If the bureau’s going to send in an informant, the informant’s going to be wired, and if the bureau is monitoring telephone calls, there’s going to be a transcript of that,” Gowdy said in May on Fox News' “Sunday Morning Futures,” acknowledging he was aware of the files and suggesting they included exculpatory information.

TREY GOWDY: SECRET FBI TRANSCRIPTS FROM RUSSIA PROBE COULD BE 'GAME-CHANGER'

“Some of us have been fortunate enough to know whether or not those transcripts exist. But they haven’t been made public, and I think one, in particular ... has the potential to actually persuade people,"" he continued. “Very little in this Russia probe I’m afraid is going to persuade people who hate Trump or love Trump. But there is some information in these transcripts that has the potential to be a game-changer if it’s ever made public.”

The transcripts are currently classified, according to sources, but under President Trump’s move in May to approve declassification of documents related to the surveillance of his campaign during the 2016 election, Barr will likely have access to those documents in a declassified format.

A source told Fox News that without the declassification order signed by Trump, Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats was not going to give anyone access to the files—over concerns for protecting sources and methods. But another source told Fox News in May that Coats, along with CIA Director Gina Haspel and FBI Director Chris Wray, are all working “collaboratively” with Barr and Durham on the review.

Barr and Durham are also trying to pinpoint the actual “start date” of the investigation, according to a source.

It has been widely reported, at this point, that the investigation was officially opened by former FBI senior counterintelligence agent Peter Strzok on July 31, 2016, after Downer shared the information that Papadopoulos was told the Russians had “dirt” on Clinton. But some suggest the probe began before that date.

On Wednesday, House Intelligence Committee Ranking Member Devin Nunes, R-Calif., challenged former Special Counsel Mueller over when the investigation started.

""The FBI claims the counterintelligence investigation of the Trump campaign began on July 31, 2016, but in fact, it began before that,"" Nunes said. ""In June 2016, before the investigation was officially opened, Trump campaign associates Carter Page and Stephen Miller were invited to attend a symposium at Cambridge University in July 2016. Your office, however, did not investigate who was responsible for inviting these Trump associates to the symposium.""

Mueller replied: ""Those areas...I'm going to stay away from.""

Meanwhile, Papadopoulos said that in May 2016, he was approached by two U.S. military officials based in the U.S. Embassy in London—Gregory Baker and Terrence Dudley. He told Fox News they were questioning him about his ties in the Middle East and Trump's relationship with Russia.

“Both wanted to ingratiate themselves in campaign via myself,” Papadopoulos tweeted last year.

It is unclear at this point what, if any, involvement Baker and Dudley had in collecting intelligence related to the Trump campaign. Both Baker and Dudley disputed Papadopoulos’ tweet, and reportedly said they reached out to him out of curiosity.

The president, his surrogates and Republicans on Capitol Hill since the start of the Mueller investigation have called for a separate probe into the Russia investigation's beginnings. Barr earlier this year assigned Durham to probe “all intelligence collection activities” related to the Trump campaign during the 2016 presidential election.

The Barr-Durham review is likely to draw more attention following Mueller’s highly anticipated testimony on Capitol Hill. Republicans sought to focus their questioning on the origins of the Russia investigation under then-Director James Comey's FBI—a topic Mueller repeatedly said was “out of his purview” due to the ongoing investigation being led by the Justice Department. Another review is being conducted by the DOJ inspector general.

“Maybe a better course of action is to figure out how the false accusations started,” Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, said Wednesday. “Here’s the good news—that’s exactly what Bill Barr is doing and thank goodness for that.”"
