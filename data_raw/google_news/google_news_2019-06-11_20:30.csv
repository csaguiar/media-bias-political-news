Biden to slam Trump as 'existential threat' during dueling Iowa stops,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Paul Steinhauser', 'Paul Steinhauser Is A Contributing Editor Based In New Hampshire.']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-to-slam-trump-during-dueling-iowa-stops-calling-him-an-existential-threat,"In what could be a preview of next year’s general election campaign for the White House, both President Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden will go head to head on Tuesday as they each make stops in Iowa, the state that kicks off the presidential caucus and primary calendar.

And Biden, the clear front-runner right now in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination, is using the opportunity to blast the Republican president for threatening tariffs on global trading partners. Warning of the impact it’s had on American farmers and manufacturers, Biden plans to call Trump an “existential threat” to the nation.

BIDEN CRITICIZED BY FELLOW DEMOCRATS FOR LIGHT SCHEDULE

“You know, Donald Trump and I are both in Iowa today. It wasn’t planned that way, but I hope Trump’s presence here will be a clarifying event,” Biden will say during an evening speech in Davenport, according to prepared remarks.

The former vice president’s remarks, released early Tuesday morning by his campaign, contain more than 40 mentions of Trump by name, including some of Biden’s most blistering attacks to date on the president.

The president responded, even before arriving in Iowa, calling Biden ""the weakest mentally.""

In a free-ranging back and forth with reporters on the White House lawn before departing for Iowa, Trump claimed ""it looks like he’s failing, it looks like his friends from the left are going to overtake him very soon,” Trump said. “When a man has to mention my name 76 times in his speech, that means he’s in trouble. He’s a different guy. He acts different than he used to. He looks different than he used to.”

“I’d rather run against, I think, Biden than anybody,” Trump added. “I think he’s the weakest mentally and I think Joe is weak mentally. The others have much more energy.”

Biden, in his speech later in the day, will argue that “America’s farmers have been crushed by his tariff war with China. No one knows that better than Iowa,”

Biden will add that Trump ""thinks he’s being tough. Well, it’s easy to be tough when someone else is feeling the pain.”

And Biden will ask “how many farmers across this state and across this nation have had to face the prospect of losing their business, of losing their farm because of Trump’s tariffs?”

Spotlighting the anxiety he said farmers are feeling, Biden will ask “how many have had to stare at the ceiling at night wondering how they’re going to make it? How many sleepless nights do you think Trump has had over what he’s doing to America’s farmers?”

Answering his own question, the former vice president plans to say “just as many as he had when he stiffed the construction workers and electricians and plumbers who built his hotels and casinos. Zero.” And questioning why the president “just backed off his tariff threat with Mexico because he got some tough new deal,” Biden will say “maybe there’s some secret development yet to be revealed— but based on what we know, it seems more like old wine in new bottles.”

Biden will also argue that “the truth is he’s scared – his economic folks told him his tough talk was about to cost to him Michigan and Ohio and Iowa.”

The president on Friday dropped the latest tariff threat as he announced that the U.S. and Mexico had reached a deal to stem the flow of migrants.

Amid criticism from Democrats, the president tweeted Monday that a “very important” part of the agreement with Mexico would be “revealed in the not too distant future.”

And, in an interview with CNBC, he touted, “If we didn’t have tariffs we wouldn’t have made a deal with Mexico.”

“This is something the U.S. has been trying to get for over 20 years with Mexico. As soon as I put tariffs on the table it was done — it took two days,” he said.

DEBATE OVER THE DEBATES: SOME DEMOCRATS FUME OVER DNC CRITERIA AS CUT OFF LOOMS

The president will be along the western edge of Iowa on Tuesday, visiting a renewable energy facility in Council Bluffs before headlining a state GOP fundraiser in West Des Moines.

Biden will campaign in the eastern part of the crucial caucus state, with stops in Ottumwa and Mt. Pleasant before giving his speech in Davenport. He’s also expected to hammer the president over climate change and health care.

“I believe Trump is an existential threat to America,” Biden will say.

White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders, responding to the speech, called the theme ""truly laughable.""

""The idea that he would say that the president poses any type of threat is truly laughable, considering he was part of the administration that allowed Russia to interfere in our election,"" Sanders elaborated.

The former vice president’s trip – his second to Iowa since launching his 2020 presidential campaign in late April – comes two days after he skipped the first major cattle call of the year in Iowa.

Biden took some incoming fire for missing the Iowa Democratic Party’s Hall of Fame dinner, which was held Sunday in Cedar Rapids. Nineteen of the nearly two-dozen candidates spoke at the annual gathering.

Speaking Monday night at a fundraiser in the nation’s capital, Biden fired back.

“One of my competitors criticized me for not going to Iowa to talk for 5 minutes,"" he said according to a pool report. ""My granddaughter was graduating. It was my daughter’s birthday. I would skip inauguration for that.""

And Biden will address the sniping again in his Davenport speech.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

""I guess some folks were surprised I made that choice, but I don't know why,"" he will say. ""There are some things more important than running for president -- and my daughter and granddaughter are two of them. So I'll make the same decision every time.""

With seven months to go until the Iowa caucus, Biden remains the front-runner in the Hawkeye State. A Des Moines Register/CNN poll released Sunday indicates the former vice president with 27 percent support, followed by Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont at 15 percent, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts at 12 percent, South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg at 10 percent, and Sen. Kamala Harris of California at 9 percent. Everyone else in the field registered at 2 percent or less."

“I'm done with him,” Pelosi said while being interviewed on stage at the 2019 Fiscal Policy event hosted by Peter G. Peterson Foundation.

In response to Pelosi's statments, Trump fired back to reporters at the White House Tuesday calling Pelosi ""a mess.""

""Nancy is a mess, the Democratic Party is a mess and they're doing everything they can to win the election,"" Trump said.

Trump attacked Pelosi in an interview with Fox News during his overseas trip in France last Thursday commemorating the 75th anniversary of D-Day calling her a “nasty, vindictive, horrible person.”

“I think she’s a disgrace,” Trump said “I actually don’t think she’s a talented person, I’ve tried to be nice to her because I would have liked to have gotten some deals done. She’s incapable of doing deals, she’s a nasty, vindictive, horrible person, the Mueller report came out, it was a disaster for them.”

Pelosi said on Tuesday she has decided not to fire back at the president and instead said she “doesn’t even want to talk about him.”

""My stock goes up every time he attacks me, so what can I say, but let's not spend too much time on that because that's his victory, the diverter-in-chief, the diverter-of-attention-in-chief.""

Pelosi repeated her previously expressed view that impeachment of Trump is ""not off the table,"" but stopped short of saying whether she has an obligation to mount an impeachment inquiry.

""I don't think you should impeach for political reasons, and I don't think you should not impeach for political reasons,"" Pelosi said.

She added, “I think the Mueller report very clearly spells out at least ten or 11 instances of obstruction of justice. But I'm not here to have that discussion. That's for the committees.”

""If you open an impeachment inquiry, do you get more information?"" Pelosi said. ""You still end up in the court.""

She added that the numbers are ""note even close"" within the Democratic caucus to move forward with impeachment.

During a closed door meeting on Capitol Hill last Tuesday, Pelosi told key Democratic committee leaders ""I want to see him in prison"" rather see Trump be impeached, according to officials familiar with the conversation.

While she did not confirm on Tuesday whether she did in fact express that sentiment to her caucus, she did not deny it either.

“When we have conversations in our caucus they stay in our caucus,” Pelosi said. “Do people think there's some impeachable offenses that the President committed? Yes. How serious are they? Are they criminal? Many people think they are."""
Trump Wants To Limit Aid For Low-Income Americans. A Look At His Proposals,https://www.npr.org,['Pam Fessler'],06-11-2019,2019,6,https://www.npr.org/2019/06/11/730639328/trump-wants-to-limit-aid-for-low-income-americans-a-look-at-his-proposals,"Trump Wants To Limit Aid For Low-Income Americans. A Look At His Proposals

Enlarge this image toggle caption John Moore/Getty Images John Moore/Getty Images

If you're poor or low-income in the U.S. and take advantage of government safety net programs, you could be affected by a number of new rules and actions proposed by the Trump administration. Most of the changes are still pending, and anti-poverty groups are trying to stop them from going into effect. Some of the proposals already face legal challenges.

President Trump has said repeatedly that he wants to get more people off government aid and into the workforce so they can become self-sufficient. To help do that, he issued an executive order last year to reduce poverty ""by promoting opportunity and economic mobility.""

In it, Trump called on federal agencies to streamline existing welfare programs, strengthen work requirements and make sure that taxpayer money is spent on ""those who are truly in need.""

But anti-poverty advocates say the administration's proposals would hurt, rather than help, poor Americans. They say it will make it more difficult for those trying to become self-sufficient by denying them food, housing and medical assistance when they need it most.

""They really are trying to use every agency to make life harder for people who are low-income,"" says Elizabeth Lower-Basch, director of income and work supports at the Center for Law and Social Policy.

Deborah Weinstein, executive director of the Coalition on Human Needs, which represents about 100 anti-poverty groups nationwide, calls the volume of proposals targeting the safety net ""head spinning.""

Here are some of the main proposals and their status:

Loading...

Food aid

The Department of Agriculture has called for stricter enforcement of a requirement that able-bodied adults work, volunteer or get job training for at least 20 hours a week to continue getting their Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits, or food stamps, after three months. Currently, most states waive that requirement. The administration would make that much more difficult to do. Critics estimate that 750,000 SNAP recipients would likely have their benefits cut off because they would be unable to find jobs or otherwise meet the requirements. The public comment period on the proposal ended April 10 and attracted more than 100,000 comments, overwhelmingly negative.

The Department of Agriculture is weighing a rule to make it harder for people to qualify for both SNAP and other welfare assistance. Currently, states have the flexibility to waive asset and income limits for those who get both food stamps and benefits from the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program. Anti-poverty advocates argue that changing that would penalize hundreds of thousands of working poor families by taking away their food aid just as they start earning enough to pay for other living expenses, such as child care and housing. But supporters of the proposal say states are exploiting a loophole in the law to give aid to those who would otherwise be ineligible. It is unclear exactly what the administration will propose and when. The rule has yet to be published in the Federal Register.

Payday loans

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has proposed rescinding an Obama-era regulation that would require payday lenders to determine whether a borrower has the ability to repay the loan. That regulation, which the Trump administration has delayed until next year, was intended to prevent low-income borrowers from becoming saddled with ballooning debt because payday loans can carry annual interest rates of 300% or more. Consumer advocates say low-income individuals often have to take out new payday loans to pay off earlier ones. The Trump administration argues that rescinding the Obama-era rule will encourage more competition in the industry and provide more options for borrowers. The public comment period on the proposed change closed May 15. It is unclear when a final rule will be issued.

Poverty line

The Office of Management and Budget is considering whether to recalculate the official poverty line using a different inflation measure, one that many economists say would paint a more accurate picture of the price increases that consumers face. But critics say the change would not reflect how inflation affects low- and moderate-income families and, over time, would lead to millions of people seeing their government benefits — such as SNAP, Medicaid, energy assistance and school lunches — reduced or eliminated. The Obama and George W. Bush administrations tried to make a similar change in the poverty line calculation with no luck. The public comment period ends June 21.

Immigration

The Department of Homeland Security has proposed limiting the ability of immigrants to get green cards if they receive government benefits, such as SNAP or housing aid. The administration says it is enforcing existing law, which seeks to block immigrants who could need assistance and become a ""public charge."" But immigrants' rights groups say the proposed change would affect not only immigrants but also family members who are U.S. citizens. Social service providers around the country report that they have already seen a big drop in immigrant families signing up for assistance, including Medicaid and SNAP, because of fears that it could hurt their efforts to get green cards or become citizens. The comment period on the proposed rule ended in December. More than a quarter of a million comments were received, mostly opposed to the change. It is unclear when the final rule will be issued.

President Trump signed a memorandum May 23 calling on federal agencies to enforce a law requiring those who sponsor green card holders to reimburse government agencies for the cost of any public benefits used by the immigrant. The administration says the law has not been fully enforced. ""To protect benefits for American citizens, immigrants must be financially self-sufficient,"" Trump said in a statement announcing the move. Immigrants' rights advocates say the announcement is part of a larger campaign by the Trump administration to restrict both legal and illegal immigration, and that the change will discourage green card holders from applying for benefits for which they or other family members are eligible.

Housing

The Department of Housing and Urban Development has proposed a rule that would deny housing assistance to families with one or more members who are undocumented immigrants. The administration notes that those in the country illegally are not eligible for housing aid, although HUD now prorates rental assistance for such ""mixed status"" families to take that into account. By HUD's own estimate, 55,000 children who are either citizens or legal residents could lose their housing as a result of the move. Critics call the proposal ""cruel"" and are waging a vigorous campaign to block it. HUD Secretary Ben Carson defended it, saying that ""it seems only logical that taxpaying American citizens should be taken care of first"" and that the change would provide more aid for needy Americans. However, HUD's own analysis concludes that the rule would lead to fewer people getting housing aid and to an increase in homelessness. The public comment period for the proposed rule runs through July 9, but House Democrats are trying to prevent HUD from enforcing such a rule.

The Agriculture Department is expected to propose a rule later this year similar to HUD's proposal, to restrict the use of rural housing assistance for households that have one or more members who are undocumented immigrants.

HUD has proposed that the operators of federally funded homeless shelters be allowed to determine which services transgender individuals can use. Operators could base their decisions on their religious beliefs, among other factors. Critics say that if the rule is adopted, transgender individuals could be kicked out of shelters or forced to use ones that serve a gender they do not identify with. Carson had assured lawmakers at a congressional hearing May 21 that he did not anticipate eliminating Obama-era rules that protect transgender individuals from housing discrimination, and lawmakers were angry to see the proposed rule on a list published by the administration the following day. Details of the rule are expected to be made public later this year for comment. About 1 in 5 transgender individuals experiences homelessness at some point in their life, according to the National Center for Transgender Equality.

Medicaid work requirement

The administration has approved waivers allowing eight states to impose work requirements on Medicaid recipients, although legal challenges have blocked such efforts in Kentucky and Arkansas. The administration argues that the requirement will encourage people to join the workforce, but opponents say that instead it will deny low-income families much-needed medical aid. About 18,000 Arkansas residents lost their Medicaid coverage when the work requirements went into effect in that state last year.

Census citizenship question

Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has proposed adding a question to the 2020 census asking whether an individual is a U.S. citizen. The administration says that it needs the information to help enforce the Voting Rights Act, but opponents believe that the real motive is to diminish minority representation. Civil rights groups argue that the question will discourage immigrant and noncitizen households from participating in the census. The result would be an undercount, especially in areas with large immigrant populations. Opponents of the change say low-income communities would be harmed because the census numbers are used to allocate hundreds of billions of dollars in federal aid, including many safety net benefits. They've challenged the citizenship question in court. The case is now before the U.S. Supreme Court, which is expected to rule in June.

"In 'The Enemy Of The People,' CNN Reporter Recounts His Time Covering President Trump",https://www.npr.org,['Annalisa Quinn'],06-11-2019,2019,6,https://www.npr.org/2019/06/11/731593232/in-the-enemy-of-the-people-cnn-reporter-recounts-his-time-covering-president-tru,"In 'The Enemy Of The People,' CNN Reporter Recounts His Time Covering President Trump

As the most visible reporter to regularly spar with the president, CNN White House correspondent Jim Acosta is a disputed icon.

President Trump has called Acosta a ""rude, terrible person"" and ""fake news."" To many on the right, he represents deep media bias; to some on the left, he represents media pushback against Trump's frequent lies. In his daily life, he is subject to near-constant abuse, insults and threats — along with some praise and a lot of selfie requests.

More telling, perhaps, than either the praise or the insults is a friendly interaction Acosta recounts in his new book, The Enemy of the People: A Dangerous Time to Tell the Truth in America.

Acosta was covering a Trump rally in South Carolina in 2018 when a Trump supporter came into the press pen and asked to borrow a chair. Acosta offered his, they had a pleasant chat and the man mentioned how odd it was to see Acosta reciting the pledge of allegiance and singing ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" at the rally along with everyone else.

""I thought to myself, Yes, I know the pledge and the national anthem. I'm an American,"" Acosta writes. ""But the moment spoke volumes. Members of the press have been so savaged by Trump and his propagandists in the media that journalists seem almost foreign or anti-American to his supporters.""

The Enemy of the People would have been a good place to ask why Trump has succeeded in this project. But Acosta used it as an opportunity to relitigate his spats with the White House rather than to meaningfully interrogate the cultural shift that left huge numbers of people despising and fearing the press.

In his most famous confrontation with the president, Acosta refused to cede the microphone to another reporter during a press briefing. An intern tried to take it, Acosta held onto it and the White House revoked his automatic access, while also publicizing a doctored video suggesting he had somehow pushed or hit the intern (he had not). A legal battle for access followed, and Acosta's pass was restored. The Enemy of the People gives his side of this fight, along with the history of his other interactions with the president, and how he has come to believe in fighting fire with fire.

In The Enemy of the People, Acosta sounds less like a reporter than a rival athlete: ""We beat Trump!"" Acosta remembers shouting after the lawsuit. Later, he writes, the ""Trump people ... had clearly gotten spanked."" The tone throughout is jocular and self-congratulatory. Describing a Trump confrontation, he writes that another reporter was ""the real hero"" of the news conference for defending Acosta, something you only say if you believe you are, in fact, the apparent and obvious hero.

""I don't believe reporters are supposed to be the story,"" Acosta writes. ""That's how I was trained. But at that press conference, I had faced a choice: Do we just absorb Trump's attacks? Or do we push back and stand up for ourselves?"" This feels like an artificial distinction. Reporters become part of the story when the president attacks them. But in between absorbing abuse and hitting back is another option: fighting for access, challenging the president on lies, and reporting the facts the way you would with any other story. Acosta seems to believe that the attacks give him special dispensation to offer his personal opinions, and that doing so is even an act of bravery or public service.



There is a difference between saying that Trump encouraged violence against protesters (fact) and referring to the ""[t]oxic Trump effect on our national discourse"" (opinion), or between saying that Sarah Sanders often attacks the press for accurate reporting (fact) and Sarah Sanders said ""some of the vilest, most un-American stuff that has ever been said in the White House briefing room"" (opinion). In other words, Acosta has become a commentator, not a reporter.

In a CBS interview over the weekend, Acosta spoke about the dangers of Trump's rhetoric about journalists. An angry Trump supporter mailed pipe bombs, Acosta explained, to CNN ""and other Democratic targets.""

""And other Democratic targets"" was clearly a slip of the tongue: CNN is not affiliated with any party. Acosta meant perceived Democratic targets. But the mistake (which he has made before) is nonetheless telling. Acosta has allowed Trump to set the terms of engagement. Trump paints the media as the opposition, and Acosta has accepted the mantle without wondering what he might be giving up in return.

This is most apparent when he uses Trump's tactics to justify his own combativeness: ""I don't recall Trump ever apologizing for his behavior,"" he writes at one point. ""Hey, if they can do it, my thought was, why can't we?"" he writes at another. But I can think of lots of reasons, starting with the use of the words we and they."
Trump is reportedly in denial about his campaign’s bleak internal polling,https://www.vox.com,['Jun'],06-11-2019,2019,6,https://www.vox.com/2019/6/11/18661072/trump-campaign-internal-polling-denial,"During campaign rallies since he’s become president, President Donald Trump has repeatedly dismissed polls that reflect poorly on him as somehow representing “suppression,” or not including the 10 percent of people he thinks support him but refuse to say so publicly.

But his denialism about bad polling now reportedly extends to polls conducted by his own campaign.

As Politico recently detailed, the Trump campaign put together a 17-state polling project that found the president lagging behind Democratic frontrunner Joe Biden in key battleground states like Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan. But according to the New York Times’s Annie Karni and Maggie Haberman, after he was briefed about the “devastating” polling, Trump told his aides to deny it and instead tout polls showing him doing better.

From the Times:

After being briefed on a devastating 17-state poll conducted by his campaign pollster, Tony Fabrizio, Mr. Trump told aides to deny that his internal polling showed him trailing Mr. Biden in many of the states he needs to win, even though he is also trailing in public polls from key states like Texas, Michigan and Pennsylvania. And when top-line details of the polling leaked, including numbers showing the president lagging in a cluster of critical Rust Belt states, Mr. Trump instructed aides to say publicly that other data showed him doing well.

Along the lines of “other data” that shows him doing well, Trump on Monday evening tweeted a poll from his favorite pollster, Rasmussen, showing his approval rating at a relatively robust 50 percent.

Despite the Phony Witch Hunt, we will continue to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! Thank you!! pic.twitter.com/MXuiolM745 — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 10, 2019

But there are a couple of reasons not to give much credence to Trump’s tweet. First, as CNN detailed in December, Rasmussen — which is known to skew to the right — was the least accurate pollster out of any that released generic congressional ballot polls in the runup to November’s midterm elections:

Rasmussen’s final poll was the least accurate of any of the 32 polls. They had the Republicans ahead nationally by one point. Democrats are currently winning the national House vote by 8.6 points. That’s an error of nearly 10 points.

Secondly, and relatedly, the Rasmussen poll Trump cited is an outlier when compared to others. For instance, RealClearPolitics’ aggregated polling of Trump’s approval rating, which includes Rasmussen, currently has it pegged at a much more problematic 44 percent, with 53 percent disapproving of his job performance.

Perhaps even more important than Trump’s consistently low approval rating is the fact that he’s underwater in battleground states key to his 2020 prospects. As my colleague Dylan Scott detailed last week, state polls from Morning Consult found Trump’s approval rating below his disapproval rating in New Hampshire, Wisconsin, Michigan, Iowa, Arizona, Pennsylvania, Ohio, North Carolina, and Indiana. Especially bleak is the fact that Trump’s approval rating is more than a dozen points underwater in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Iowa — all states he won in 2016.

Of course, a lot can change between now and November of next year. And in fairness to Trump, it is true that state-level polls underestimated his support in 2016, even if national ones were more accurate about Hillary Clinton’s 2.1 percent margin of popular vote victory than Trump would have you believe. It’s undeniable, however, that the 2020 polling, taken in its totality, doesn’t look good for Trump right now.

But instead of engaging with that reality, Trump is reportedly putting his head in the sand and his faith in Rasmussen.

"Firearms distributor files for bankruptcy, says gun sales dropped when Trump became president",https://www.foxbusiness.com,['Kathleen Joyce'],,,,https://www.foxbusiness.com/features/firearms-distributor-files-for-bankruptcy-after-gun-sales-decreased-following-trumps-victory,"A firearms distributor filed for bankruptcy protection Monday saying sales were affected after President Trump was elected president.

United Sports Cos (USC) said it planned to liquidate its holdings citing excessive debt and inventory. The company, which served 20,000 in the U.S., also cited “significant disruptions” in other retailers, such as Bass Pro Shop buying Cabela in 2017, Reuters reported.

The company banked on Hillary Clinton winning the election and boosted its inventory before the race, CEO Bradley Johnson said in a court filing with the U.S. bankruptcy court in Wilmington, Del. Sales of firearms slowed dramatically after the election of Trump as president in 2016 allayed fears of a Democratic crackdown on gun owners, The Associated Press reported in March 2018.

The company expected higher sales but Clinton lost the election. Johnson said sales fell from an average of $885.3 million from 2012 to 2016 to $557 million in 2018. According to its petition, USC said it had “between $100 million and $500 million in liabilities,” Reuters reported.

Following the school shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in February 2018, Dick’s Sporting Goods announced it would stop selling firearms at its stores. Last year, Remington Outdoor Co. went bankrupt.

USC, founded in 1933, carries brands such as Remington, Smith & Wesson and Glock. The company, which also sells outdoor equipment, was the “largest distributor of firearms in the U.S.” a few years ago, according to Bloomberg. However, Wellspring Capital Management, the company’s largest equity owner, “cashed out” more than $183 million “through dividend recapitalization deals in 2012 and 2013,” Bloomberg reported.

USC blamed mismanagement at Wellspring for its decline. The company said Wellspring “appointed fiduciaries who grossly mismanaged the business and depleted all reserves necessary to weather the storms and the headwinds the business would face,” Bloomberg reported.

Judge Napolitano 'surprised' Bill Barr agreed to turn over Mueller report documents to Nadler,https://www.foxnews.com,"['David Montanaro', 'David Montanaro Is An Editor With Fox News.']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/judge-napolitano-bill-barr-mueller-report-documents-nadler,"Fox News senior judicial analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano said Tuesday morning he was ""kind of surprised"" that the Justice Department agreed to turn over key evidence from Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential elections, which included whether there were ties between President Trump and Russian officials.

Meanwhile, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., announced Monday that he plans to hit pause on efforts to hold Attorney General Bill Barr in contempt of Congress.

Nadler’s announcement came after the Judiciary Committee voted to hold Barr in contempt last month after the Justice Department did not comply with a subpoena seeking access to an unredacted version of Mueller’s report, as well as underlying documents and evidence. President Trump also asserted executive privilege over the files in a bid to protect them from release.

Nadler said the Justice Department would begin sharing the documents with his panel late Monday, and added that both Democrats and Republicans would have access to the files.

Nadler did say, however, that if “important information is held back,” then the committee would have “no choice but to enforce our subpoena in court and consider other remedies.”

Reacting to the developments on ""Fox & Friends,"" Napolitano called it a ""surprising"" move by Barr and one that could have been averted.

""It also shows you the power the Congress has,"" he said, adding he believes Barr made the deal to avoid being held in contempt of Congress and later being forced to comply with the subpoena by a federal judge.

Napolitano said Barr should not have ""sat on"" the subpoena from the Judiciary Committee, but immediately challenged it in federal court.

""The attorney general is a very smart fellow, but I am surprised he agreed to release these documents.""

Shanahan's memos follow recent reporting that the White House Military Office coordinated directly with the Navy's Seventh Fleet to have the USS John S. McCain hidden from view during President Donald Trump's visit to Japan last month. After the news surfaced, Shanahan told reporters that request was ultimately not carried out.

""Those of us privileged to serve our Nation, in and out of uniform, in the DoD must be the epitome of American values and ethics. Our mission, to protect and defend the Nation, is apolitical,"" Shanahan wrote in one of Tuesday's memos.

""I call on leaders at all levels in the Department to reinforce the apolitical nature of military and civilian service and professionalism, while ensuring all personnel remain free to exercise the responsibilities of citizenship as laws and regulations allow,"" he added.

Following the USS John McCain controversy, Shanahan repeatedly insisted that ""there's no room for politicizing the military"" -- a point he again emphasized in Tuesday's memos to DoD personnel.

The Mid-Continent quarry has sat for decades in the hills of western Colorado, where kayakers paddle the Roaring Fork River and tourists soak in the natural hot springs. But now a proposed expansion of the 16-acre limestone mine has kicked off a battle that stretches to the office of Interior Secretary David Bernhardt, whose former employer is lobbying for the project.

The mine's owner, Rocky Mountain Resources, is led by CEO Chad Brownstein, whose father chairs the major lobbying firm where Bernhardt worked for a decade. Bernhardt’s old firm is pushing the mining proposal on two fronts, according to interviews and POLITICO’s review of public records — pressing local government leaders to endorse the project, while meeting in D.C. with Interior staff who could decide the expansion’s fate.

Bernhardt promised nearly two years ago to recuse himself from decisions involving his former firm’s clients. But that ethics pledge expires in August, freeing him to work on those issues. An Interior spokesperson would only refer to that pledge when asked whether he’d recused himself from the mine's proposal, and declined to say what action he may take when the pledge expires.

The mine’s array of powerful allies is inspiring deep unease among leaders in Glenwood Springs, a community of 10,000 people whose outdoor tourist attractions include hot springs, whitewater rafting, fly fishing and scenic mountain trails. Residents worry that the expansion, which would allow the mine to spread across 440 acres, would bring a surge of truck traffic, dust and noise — as well as the scarring on the mountain ridge that would become visible from the town. And they say the mine is already violating its permits.

The dispute also follows months of questions from House Democrats and Interior’s internal watchdog about whether the department is taking actions that benefit Bernhardt’s former employer, Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck.

“We’re acutely aware of Chad Brownstein and the relationship to David Bernhardt,” said Jeff Peterson, executive director of Glenwood Springs Citizens Alliance, a group formed to oppose the mine expansion. “It’s something unfortunately we can’t control. But there’s a real concern that this will get essentially rubber stamped and it doesn’t matter what it will do to our community.”

Glenwood Springs Mayor Jonathan Godes agreed.

“Our concern is that there is going to be one of the largest mines in Colorado directly abutting our city,” Godes said. “And when you have a former lobbyist for one of the largest legal lobbying firms in the extractive industry running DOI ... and Norm Brownstein the father of the CEO of Rocky Mountain Resources, it doesn't take a huge leap of faith to say something ain’t right here.”

Just the sheer lobbying firepower Rocky Mountain Resources is bringing to the project may be enough to pressure Interior employees, said Daniel Stevens, executive director at the watchdog group Campaign for Accountability.

Brownstein Hyatt “has a lot of pull, and when it asks Interior to jump, Interior jumps,” Daniels said. “Does every other small firm applying for a mining permit run to the top lobbying firm in the country to work on their behalf? Seems a little disproportionate here.”

RMR defended its corporate track record and its project, but the company and its executives did not respond to detailed questions about its lobbying efforts and ties to Bernhardt. Jon Hrobsky, one of the Brownstein lobbyists working on behalf of RMR, has known Bernhardt since they were both staffers for former Republican Colorado Rep. Scott McInnis and worked with him at Interior during the George W. Bush administration. Hrobsky and another Brownstein lobbyist, Luke Johnson, have both met with Interior officials to discuss ""natural resources"" on behalf of the company, according to the disclosure forms.

The Brownstein firm registered as lobbying for RMR as of April 30, according to its disclosure form. But two of its employees, Michael Stratton and Christine Jochim, have been assisting RMR since at least February, according to emails POLITICO received via public information requests. On April 5, Stratton sent a message to Glenwood Springs City Manager Debra Figueroa saying he was “hoping to make progress on behalf of RMR relative to making a presentation about their quarry proposal,” according to one of the emails.

Stratton and Jochim provided legal work for RMR but did not lobby before April 30, a Brownstein spokesperson said.



When asked if Bernhardt had recused himself from the matter, an Interior spokesperson referred to his ethics pledge.

Bernhardt also has personal ties to the area: He grew up in Rifle, Colo., about a half-an-hour drive from Glenwood Springs.

The mine has been in operation since 1982. Glenwood Springs residents who have spoken up at county board meetings overwhelmingly opposed the expansion and said the noise, traffic and sheer size of the project would all but destroy their tourism-based economy.

Garfield County inspectors earlier this year found a range of violations at the mine: It has spread outside its currently permitted acreage, is selling products it wasn’t permitted to and is operating during months it had promised the county it would shut down, the inspectors wrote in a report.

In interviews, residents said the BLM’s office has refused to respond to their complaints, forcing them to turn to the agency’s D.C. headquarters. But the bureau has allowed the mine to keep operating despite its violations.

“We issued a letter [to BLM] saying we don’t think RMR is compliance,” Peterson said. “We’ve heard absolutely nothing from the BLM. It’s been crickets on that front.”

RMR, a holding company based in Beverly Hills, Calif., acquired the Mid-Continent mine in October 2016. CEO Chad Brownstein's father is Norm Brownstein, who founded and still chairs Brownstein Hyatt, where Bernhardt spent most of his professional life.

The fight between the company and the community reached a new level of antipathy in May, when RMR sued the county board and its members. The lawsuit contends that the county agreement the board is trying to enforce should take a back seat to the company’s permit from BLM.

Records indicate that board members have reached out to Bernhardt directly: They called him on Sept. 17 and met with him in his D.C. office on March 5, according to Bernhardt’s official schedules. Neither of those conversations involved the Mid-Continent mine issue, according to an Interior spokesperson and others who attended the meeting, although an initial meeting request form said the commissioners had asked to speak to Bernhardt about topics including BLM.

The board members are unable to speak about the matter, a county spokesperson said after POLITICO tried to ask them questions about the mining permit. But a month after meeting with Bernhardt, the board heard county inspectors list the mine’s violations and gave Rocky Mountain Resources until June 1 to comply.

Bernhardt has already come under fire for making policy decisions that could benefit Brownstein clients. Interior’s inspector general is reviewing Bernhardt’s role in blocking a department report analyzing how a controversial pesticide affected federally protected wildlife, and examining whether he improperly pushed to remove a species of small fish from the endangered species list to benefit a former client.

The House Committee On Oversight and Reform and the National Archives and Records Administration are also probing whether Bernhardt is suppressing the release of his meeting schedules.

Craig Holman, a lobbyist at the government watchdog group Public Citizen, said Bernhardt should allay these concerns by continuing to recuse himself from matters involving his former firm even after his ethics pledge ends in two months.

“Unfortunately, as we have seen over and over again with Bernhardt, the conflicts of interest are so widespread that they keep popping up and Bernhardt seems unable to divorce himself effectively from his former clients and employers,” Holman said.

The Brownstein firm has been actively working on the ground in Colorado to promote the project. Stratton, one of the Brownstein lobbyists, has advised Chad Brownstein on the mine since RMR acquired it in 2016, an RMR spokesperson said. He attended at least one Monday night county board hearing and has met with city officials seeking to persuade them that expanding the mine is in the community’s interests, according to interviews and documents obtained by POLITICO.



“Mike Stratton has advised Chad Brownstein for over two decades on corporate matters,” the spokesperson said. “Mike and Chad have equal to that a close personal friendship since Chad was 21.”

He has also participated in meetings and conference calls in which BLM discussed the limestone mine with RMR, said David Boyd, a spokesperson for the bureaus Northwest Colorado District. Boyd said he was “not aware” whether Chad Brownstein was involved in any of the discussions.

Stratton also represents the American Petroleum Association, the country's largest petroleum trade association.



The other Brownstein lawyer, Jochim, has worked on the mine proposal since at least February, according to emails POLITICO obtained. Jochim, a former Nuclear Regulatory Commission attorney and former Justice Department law clerk, requested in April that the city hand over all communications pertaining to the mine, according to documents POLITICO obtained through Colorado public record access laws.

Stratton declined to answer questions, saying he was not the company spokesperson. Jochim did not respond to questions.





A Rocky Mountain Resources spokesperson did not answer questions about whether Chad Brownstein or anyone in his father’s lobbying firm has discussed the project with either Bernhardt or other senior Interior staff. Company executives declined requests for an interview.

Residents and city officials said they don’t recall having any complaints about the mine before RMR bought it. The site has become the focus of numerous complaints since the new owner took over, however.



The mine’s operations have crept well outside the 16 acres originally stipulated in its county agreement and BLM permit, according to a March memo by Garfield County inspectors. Inspectors also found that RMR had not been paying royalties to the bureau for all the materials it had been extracting and selling from the mine.

Residents also complained that RMR was operating the mine year-round, violating its agreement with the county to shut operations every December to April to minimize harm to wildlife.

David McConaughy, a Glenwood Springs attorney representing the company, told the county board at its April public meeting that BLM has approved RMR’s requests for exemptions to the seasonal shutdowns since 2016. But neither BLM nor the company alerted the county at the time, board members responded.

""We’re trying to be transparent with the county ... to reconcile conflicts in the various permits,” McConaughy said at the hearing.

McConaughy declined to speak to POLITICO, referring questions to RMR.

BLM returned Rocky Mountain Resources’ March expansion proposal to the company within the required 30-day review period, saying the plan didn’t contain enough information. The local BLM office is “currently determining how to address the existing mining operations as well as any future proposal,” the bureau’s Boyd said.

“As would typically be the case for controversial topics in a field office, the BLM Washington Office and DOI have been briefed on the potential expansion proposal for the Mid-Continent Quarry,” Boyd added.

A Rocky Mountain Resources spokesperson defended the company’s record, saying the violations of the county agreement stemmed from problems inherited from the previous owner. The company also said the expansion would diversify the economy of a town that depends on tourists arriving to hike and ski the nearby mountains.

“Currently, many Glenwood Springs’ employers are unable or unwilling to provide their employees adequate wages to afford the town’s high cost of living, including affordable housing for teachers and developing professionals,” the company said in a statement to POLITICO. “RMR believes a community should embrace opportunities to improve the lives of its constituents, not just those who can afford to influence local politics.”

Residents who spoke to POLITICO said RMR’s economic arguments ring hollow.

Besides expanding the mining pit area, RMR also proposed increasing truck traffic from around 20 round trips a day to as many as 450, according to a proposal it submitted to the BLM in March. The dramatic increase in traffic — plus the sight of the expanded mine in the hills above the town — would all but cripple Glenwood Springs’ tourist economy, said former Mayor Michael Gamba, a Republican civil engineer.

“We had lived harmoniously with that mine for the past 20-plus years,” Gamba said in an interview. “Had nothing changed, we would have had no objections to them having it. But the proposed expansion is an existential threat to our community.”"

(Paul J. Richards/AFP/Getty Images)

John V. Kelly, the acting inspector general for the Department of Homeland Security, announced his retirement Monday following revelations that he directed his staff to whitewash audits of the agency’s performance after federal disasters.

Kelly, 64, a career auditor who rose to the top job in 2017, announced his retirement in a brief email Monday morning to hundreds of DHS employees and contractors.

“It has been an honor and privilege to serve the American citizens for over 40 years,” he wrote. “However, it is time for me to retire.”

Kelly, who had planned to retire after the confirmation of President Trump’s nominee for the position, wrote in an email to The Washington Post that he “accelerated my retirement because I feel it’s in the best interest of the organization and its employees.”

“As I told the staff, I have truly enjoyed my 11-year tenure with the DHS OIG, an organization with a very important mission and extraordinary staff and managers that successfully execute that mission on a daily basis,” Kelly wrote. “Nobody in DHS leadership or any member of Congress asked me retire.”

Kelly’s announcement follows The Post’s report last week that an internal review found that Kelly overrode auditors who had found problems with the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s response to various disasters.

When teams of auditors flew to local communities to assess how well FEMA was helping residents recover, Kelly — then in charge of the emergency management auditing staff — directed them to ignore most problems, according to the internal review and interviews. Instead, he told them to produce what the staff dubbed “feel-good reports.”

[How the DHS watchdog whitewashed audits of FEMA’s disaster response]

The practice was repeated over five years after hurricanes, floods, wildfires and other disasters, including Hurricane Sandy in 2012 and catastrophic flooding in Louisiana in 2016, the review found.

Under pressure from House Republicans, the inspector general’s office retracted 13 faulty reports and purged them from its website in 2017 and 2018. Officials acknowledged they did not comply with federal auditing standards.

The inspector general’s office then spent 14 months examining what occurred. Kelly was recused from the review.

Investigators found that Kelly had praised FEMA’s work ethic to his auditors, telling them they would see “FEMA at her best” and instructing supervisors to emphasize what the agency had done right in its disaster response

Kelly joined the inspector general’s office in 2008 from the Government Accountability Office, where his long career covered performance and financial audits and program evaluations at numerous federal agencies.

A graduate of the University of Scranton, he quickly rose through the ranks in the DHS inspector general’s office, which provides independent, fact-driven audits and investigations of the performance of the sprawling agency.

The flawed audits on his watch represented a tiny fraction of the watchdog’s oversight of FEMA. The internal review did not find that Kelly was influenced by a personal relationship with anyone at the emergency response agency.

However, Jennifer Costello, the deputy inspector general, told the head of the internal review team that the “retraction of publicly issued reports because they are not reliable” was “not an insignificant matter.”

The reports, Costello wrote, “represent millions of wasted taxpayer dollars and understandably cast doubt on our credibility.” She said the inspector general’s office needs to hold itself to “the same standards to which we hold the Department when conducting oversight of its programs and operation.”

When the internal review was made public on May 23, Kelly sent his staff an email of apology, writing, “I take responsibility for failing to set a tone that all of our products need to be fully objective.”

The office has agreed to an outside review of its performance by another federal inspector general’s office to ensure that it has improved its overall operations and oversight of FEMA.

Trump this spring nominated Joseph V. Cuffari, a policy adviser to Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey (R), to lead the office. His nomination has not yet been voted on by the Senate.

Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), chairman of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, said that the situation underscored the need for Cuffari to be promptly confirmed. “Ensuring a department has an independent inspector general is vital to maintaining transparency and holding government agencies accountable,” Johnson said in a statement."

The oak tree sapling, imported from France's Belleau Wood forest, was planted by the two presidents last year as a representation of the two nations' friendship.

The European Sessile Oak originated from the site in France where more than 9,000 U.S. Marines died in battle during World War I. It was planted on the South Lawn of the White House on April 23, 2018 during Macron's state visit, but mysteriously disappeared five days later.

A tweet by French ambassador to the U.S. Gérard Araud on April 29 indicated that the tree was not missing, but was quarantined. The mandatory quarantine is for any living organism imported to the U.S. The tree was to be replanted later.

The tree was never replanted and died in quarantine, a diplomatic source told Agence France-Presse.

Since the planting of the ""friendship tree"" the two leaders' relationship has grown rocky over issues including, what to do in Iran, addressing climate change and world trade."
"DHS chief reveals startling stat on asylum seekers who skip hearings, disappear",https://www.foxnews.com,['Adam Shaw'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dhs-secretary-reveals-startling-stat-on-asylum-seekers-who-skip-hearings-disappear,"The acting Homeland Security secretary gave lawmakers a glimpse Tuesday into just how many asylum seekers skip their hearings after being released into the United States -- telling a Senate panel that a recent program found 90 percent miss their court dates.

Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., asked Acting Secretary Kevin McAleenan how many asylum seekers coming across the southern border show up for their hearings.

BORDER ARRESTS SKYROCKET IN MAY, AS OFFICIALS DECLARE 'FULL-BLOWN EMERGENCY'

“It depends on demographic, the court, but we see too many cases where people are not showing up,” he said, telling Graham that DHS recently conducted a pilot program with family units.

“Out of those 7,000 cases, 90 received final orders of removal in absentia, 90 percent,” he said.

“90 percent did not show up?” Graham asked.

“Correct, that is a recent sample from families crossing the border,” McAleenan clarified.

McAleenan’s testimony also painted a grim portrait of a border crisis that shows no signs of easing, with Border Patrol overwhelmed and underfunded. The secretary described authorities as hamstrung by laws that limit how long they can keep migrants in custody.

“Currently due to a single district court order, we cannot obtain effective immigration enforcement results for the families arriving at our border -- they cannot be held for longer than 21 days and do not receive rulings from immigration courts for years,” he said.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection reported that it encountered 144,000 migrants at the border in May, a level not seen in decades, describing the situation as a “full-blown emergency.” McAleenan said that 60,000 children have entered into DHS custody in just the last 40 days.

McAleenan told lawmakers they also suffer due to “misaligned” asylum standards, meaning many of those who demonstrate “credible fear” of returning home -- the initial bar for claiming asylum -- are later judged not to have a valid asylum claim.

PELOSI HITS TRUMP'S DEAL WITH MEXICO, ACCUSES HIM OF 'THREATS AND TEMPER TANTRUMS'

He also said the restrictions on how long family units can be held mean that a child is now seen as a passport to the U.S. -- a perception he said is based in reality. He testified that only 30 percent of those coming to the border are actually trying to avoid being captured.

“Unless you’re a single adult, it is very unlikely you’ll be repatriated,” he said.

McAleenan urged Congress to act to end those loopholes and to grant requested DHS funding, and suggested that moves to make asylum seekers claim asylum in their home countries or designated third-countries could help solve the crisis.

Graham’s “Secure and Protect Act of 2019,” being discussed at the hearing, would include a provision to establish refugee processing centers in Mexico and Central America, and the senator asked the DHS chief if such an approach would work.

“First of all, it would break the back of the smuggling organizations, they’re profiting from this cycle.” McAleenan said. ""It would provide access to asylum in country in a much safer manner than taking this dangerous journey and it would stop this flow immediately.”

“I believe the vast majority [of the migrant flow] would stop,” he said.

Democrats, meanwhile, suggested that the administration bears some of the blame for the situation at the border, with Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., pointing to McAleenan's recent appointment as an example of dysfunction at the department.

“In less than two and a half years, there have already been four heads of this department, we have before us an acting secretary who has been on the job for more than two months,"" he said. ""We cannot face this crisis effectively with a revolving door policy in the leadership at the Department of Homeland Security.”

McAleenan’s testimony comes amid continued negotiations between the Trump administration and Mexico on immigration. The U.S. announced on Friday that it had reached a deal with Mexico to drop threatened tariffs on Mexican imports in exchange for Mexico increasing efforts to limit U.S.-bound migration flows from Central America.

An administration source told Fox News Tuesday that a new deal for Mexico becoming a safe third country for asylum seekers was completed, but not yet announced.

A source familiar with the negotiations told Fox News on Tuesday that while the agreement with Nadler, D-N.Y., would allow members of his committee to review certain underlying evidence associated with the Mueller report, he is not going to get access to “whatever documents he wants.”

NADLER PUTS BARR CONTEMPT PUSH ON HOLD AFTER STRIKING MUELLER REPORT DEAL

“This is not a blank check. They can’t just see whatever they want,” the source told Fox News. “They have to tell us what they want to see and then we will consider that legitimate request. This is just the start of a process.”

The source also told Fox News that when Nadler requests a document, the White House will have the ability to review the files to see if any White House equities are implicated. At that point, President Trump would have the opportunity to assert executive privilege in a bid to protect them from release.

The pushback comes after Nadler on Monday announced the deal with the Justice Department for documents and evidence related to Mueller’s inquiry on whether the president obstructed justice -- an agreement that prompted him to hit pause on efforts to hold Attorney General Bill Barr in contempt, though his House colleagues are still pursuing contempt against Barr on two separate fronts this week.

Nadler in his statement described the document access as key, as fellow Democrats cast the deal as a win over the Trump administration.

“I am pleased to announce that the Department of Justice has agreed to begin complying with our committee’s subpoena by opening Robert Mueller’s most important files to us, providing us with key evidence that the Special Counsel used to assess whether the President and others obstructed justice or were engaged in misconduct,” Nadler said in his statement on Monday. “These documents will allow us to perform our constitutional duties and decide how to respond to the allegations laid out against the President by the Special Counsel.”

Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, went so far as to claim this was a DOJ ""capitulation"" and the department has begun to open up ""all"" the documents Democrats want to see.

The Justice Department agreed to give both Democrats and Republicans access to the files.

“Given our conversations with the Department, I will hold the criminal contempt process in abeyance for now,” Nadler said Monday. “We have agreed to allow the Department time to demonstrate compliance with this agreement. If the Department proceeds in good faith and we are able to obtain everything we need, then there will be no need to take further steps.”

Nadler did say, however, that if “important information is held back,” then the committee would have “no choice but to enforce our subpoena in court and consider other remedies.”

HOUSE DEMS PLAN NEW WAVE OF RUSSIA HEARINGS AMID IMPEACHMENT CHATTER

Nadler’s announcement comes after the Judiciary Committee voted to hold Barr in contempt last month, after the Justice Department did not comply with a subpoena seeking access to an unredacted version of Mueller’s Russia report, as well as underlying documents and evidence. President Trump also asserted executive privilege over the files in a bid to protect them from release.

However, at this stage House Democrats are still preparing to move forward on a separate contempt-related resolution to enforce subpoenas for Barr and former White House Counsel Don McGahn. The measure is scheduled for floor action on Tuesday.

Meanwhile, Nadler’s committee, which would oversee any potential impeachment proceedings, has sought underlying evidence related to Mueller’s obstruction of justice inquiry for months.

Last month, in his only public appearance as special counsel, Mueller maintained that there was “not sufficient evidence to charge a conspiracy” with regard to whether members of the Trump campaign coordinated with the Russian government during the 2016 presidential election.

But Mueller left open the question of whether the president obstructed justice.

“If we had had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said that,” Mueller said. “We did not determine whether the president did commit a crime.”

Republicans assail Dean’s record: 'How many presidents have you accused of being Richard Nixon?',https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],06-10-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/congress/republicans-shred-deans-record-how-many-presidents-have-you-accused-of-being-richard-nixon,"Republican lawmakers on the House Judiciary Committee Monday attacked star witness John Dean’s credibility, citing his criminal record and history of attacking President Trump and other Republicans.

“Mr. Dean has made a cottage industry out of accusing presidents of acting like Richard Nixon,” Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., said.

Dean, the ex-White House counsel in President Richard Nixon's administration, was convicted of obstruction of justice after striking a deal to cooperate with the Watergate investigation. He has spent decades critical of the GOP and wrote a book in 2004 accusing President George H.W. Bush of acts “worse than Watergate.”

He frequently appears on CNN as a paid contributor, in which he's usually criticizing Trump.

Democrats invited him to serve as their lead witness in a hearing meant to scrutinize the special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into alleged Russian collusion with the 2016 Trump campaign.

But Republicans ridiculed his appearance.

“You are functionally here as a prop because they can’t impeach the president,” Gaetz said, referring to the public polling against impeachment and resistance from Speaker Nancy Pelosi to allow an impeachment inquiry.

Dean declined to tell Gaetz how much money he has earned through his GOP criticisms in books and on television. Dean said he didn’t know.

“It’s not by choice I’ve done a lot of this,” Dean said. “I’ve been dragged into this.”

House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., and other Democrats praised Dean as a key figure in helping the Watergate prosecutors and whose testimony was deemed truthful.

And Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., recalled his father, left-wing social critic Marcus Raskin, being placed on Nixon’s enemies list. Rep. Raskin on Monday called Dean “a man of honor, a man of integrity, and a man who stands up to the truth.”

But Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., pointed out 19 discrepancies were discovered in Dean’s statements back during the Watergate investigation.

Democrats called on Dean to use his Watergate past to assess Trump’s actions to obstruct the Mueller investigation.

Nadler introduced Dean without mentioning either his criminal conviction or that his law license was revoked.

“He is most well known as a principal witness during the Senate Watergate hearing,” Nadler said. “Where his testimony was later fully corroborated as to its truthfulness by the revelations in President Nixon’s White House tapes.”

Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, read through a litany of negative comments Dean has made about Trump, including one in which he describes discussing Trump’s impeachment with Pelosi, D-Calif.

Biggs called Dean a convicted felon offering “conjecture and legal posturing,” offering dubious testimony.

“You are not the fall guy in the Watergate scandal,” Biggs told Dean. “The FBI referred to you as the master manipulator of the cover-up. The U.S. attorney’s office said you were at the center of the criminality.”

Biggs called the hearing a farce.

“So much of what you say seems very difficult to accept at face value quite frankly,” Biggs said."

Kelly joined the inspector general’s office in 2008 from the Government Accountability Office, where his long career covered performance and financial audits and program evaluations at numerous federal agencies.

A graduate of the University of Scranton, he quickly rose through the ranks in the DHS inspector general’s office, which provides independent, fact-driven audits and investigations of the performance of the sprawling agency.

The flawed audits on his watch represented a tiny fraction of the watchdog’s oversight of FEMA. The internal review did not find that Kelly was influenced by a personal relationship with anyone at the emergency response agency.

However, Jennifer Costello, the deputy inspector general, told the head of the internal review team that the “retraction of publicly issued reports because they are not reliable” was “not an insignificant matter.”

The reports, Costello wrote, “represent millions of wasted taxpayer dollars and understandably cast doubt on our credibility.” She said the inspector general’s office needs to hold itself to “the same standards to which we hold the Department when conducting oversight of its programs and operation.”

When the internal review was made public on May 23, Kelly sent his staff an email of apology, writing, “I take responsibility for failing to set a tone that all of our products need to be fully objective.”

The office has agreed to an outside review of its performance by another federal inspector general’s office to ensure that it has improved its overall operations and oversight of FEMA.

Trump this spring nominated Joseph V. Cuffari, a policy adviser to Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey (R), to lead the office. His nomination has not yet been voted on by the Senate.

Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), chairman of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, said that the situation underscored the need for Cuffari to be promptly confirmed. “Ensuring a department has an independent inspector general is vital to maintaining transparency and holding government agencies accountable,” Johnson said in a statement."
Just One Tiny Industry May Emit More Methane Than EPA Had Estimated for All of Them,https://earther.gizmodo.com,"['Yessenia Funes', 'About The Author', 'I Mostly Write About How Environmental Policy', 'Climate Change Intersect With Race', 'Class Though I Occasionally Write About Animals', 'Science', 'Art', 'Too.

People tend to equate methane with cow farts (though their burps are worse), but we may be pointing our fingers in all the wrong places, according to a new study. The production of ammonia for fertilizer may result in up to 100 times more emissions than has been previously estimated for this sector. And that alone is more than what the Environmental Protection Agency estimates all industries emit across the U.S.

The study, published May 28 in the journal Elementa, zooms into the ammonia fertilizer industry because it relies heavily on natural gas to run its production plants. Ammonia is a compound made of nitrogen, which is used across the agriculture sector to fuel the growth of crops. While the ammonia fertilizer industry’s emissions of carbon dioxide are better understood, emissions of methane—which has 25 times the global warming potential of carbon dioxide over a century—were a huge question mark. Until now.

The team of authors from Cornell University and the Environmental Defense Fund had two sampling adventures in June 2015 and September 2016 that took them to six ammonia fertilizer plants in the Midwest, including Oklahoma, Kansas, and Iowa. They used their findings to estimate industry-wide emissions throughout the U.S. The team found that the fertilizer industry results in 29 gigagrams of methane emissions a year. The EPA, however, reports this industry emitted only 0.2 gigagrams of methane a year between 2015 and 2016. As for all industries (like waste, chemical, and metals production), the EPA estimates 8 gigagrams, which is still much smaller than this single industry’s.

A worst case scenario—where other plants are consuming more natural gas than the ones analyzed—resulted in methane emissions that reached 139 gigagrams a year. For context, that’s equivalent to the carbon emissions from 669,314 passenger vehicles driven in a year. Or more than the carbon emitted from 3 billion pounds of coal burned. Best case scenario, the emissions are just 2 gigagrams of methane a year, which is still a lot more than what the EPA currently estimates for this industry.

That is pretty wild, but this is an estimate based only on six plants. They make up more than 25 percent of the 23 plants operating in 2016 and are also of varying sizes to represent the different facilities throughout the U.S., so the six are a pretty good sample. But the authors would like to examine more plants to be sure.

The researchers drove downwind from the facilities in a Google Street View car decked out with a killer methane analyzer that recorded the methane levels in the air. That way, the team was able to capture the methane emissions near the facility in the areas where wind was likely to push it. This poses some limitations, though, because not every plant had the best road access. The authors recommend looking at airborne measurements next time, too. The team looked at samples over just a few days in a single month over these two years. Capturing a longer timeline of data could further verify (or disprove!) their analysis.

Methane emissions feel especially relevant these days. The Trump administration has been attempting to roll back methane regulations since President Awful took office. (The Department of Energy actually called natural gas “freedom gas” the other day.) A coalition of states and environmental groups like the Sierra Club pressed a judge Friday to stop Trump from rolling back these protections, reports E&E News.

Methane isn’t just dangerous for our planet because it’s worsening climate change; its emissions are often coupled with particulate matter and other air pollutants that pose threats to the health of communities closest to the facilities where it’s being emitted.

DOJ supports lawsuit demanding religious tuition payments,https://www.foxnews.com,[],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/doj-supports-lawsuit-demanding-religious-tuition-payments,"The U.S. Department of Justice is backing three families who are suing to force the state of Maine to pay tuition for some students to attend religious high schools.

The ""Statement of Interest"" filed Monday supports a lawsuit that targets the state's longstanding tuition policy for students in districts that don't have a high school. In those cases, the state will pay for tuition to a private school, but not a religious school.

Over the years, state and federal courts have consistently upheld the Maine's exclusion of religious-backed private schools from the tuition program.

But the Department of Justice contends that the state has failed to justify its ""discrimination"" against religious schools, citing a U.S. Supreme Court decision in a case in which the Missouri Department of Natural Resources denied a grant to a church-affiliated preschool.

The DOJ filing reflects how the U.S. Supreme Court ""seems to be leaning our way on this issue,"" said Steven Whiting, an attorney who filed a friend-of-the-court brief on behalf of an Orthodox Jewish organization.

""The law has changed over time and now it's time for the court to look at this thing as a constitutional right. School choice shouldn't depend on whether you're religious or not,"" he said.

There was no immediate comment Tuesday from the Maine attorney general or Department of Education.

Three families in Glenburn and Palermo are suing in U.S. District Court to force the state to pay for their kids to attend Bangor Christian Schools and Temple Academy.

The lawsuit contends that denying religious schools, while allowing tuition payments for other private schools, violates the families' constitutional rights.

Maine's attorney general advised in 1980 that it's unconstitutional to use public funds to send students to schools ""characterized by a pervasively religious atmosphere."" Lawmakers enacted legislation in 1982 to prevent religious schools from receiving such tuition payments.

The U.S. Department of Justice has filed several similar actions around the country following an executive order promoting ""Free Speech and Religious Liberty"" by President Donald Trump. Then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions followed up with guidance for federal agencies in October 2017.

Last month, DOJ weighed in with support of students who are suing Vermont. The lawsuit targets the state's refusal to pay college tuition under a dual enrollment program for students attending religious high schools. The program helps students at public or secular private schools obtain college credits while attending high school.

Trump appoints Social Security Administration watchdog to also oversee Interior,https://thehill.com,[],06-10-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/447713-trump-appoints-social-security-administration-watchdog-to-also,"President Trump Donald John TrumpTop Armed Services Republican plots push for 0B defense budget Amash exits House Freedom Caucus in wake of Trump impeachment stance Amash exits House Freedom Caucus in wake of Trump impeachment stance MORE has quietly appointed his Social Security Administration (SSA) inspector general to also oversee a much different agency: the Interior Department.

On May 28, Gail Ennis began her second job overseeing the Interior Department’s Office of the Inspector General (OIG), a role she will keep for the foreseeable future, the OIG confirmed to The Hill.

The Trump administration is still awaiting the confirmation of Mark Greenblatt, the former assistant inspector general for investigations at the Commerce Department, to formally head the Interior’s OIG office.

Ennis was sworn into the SSA role just five months ago, her first time serving as an inspector general. Her professional background is in securities litigation, working previously as a partner at the Washington, D.C.-based law firm WilmerHale, where she reportedly earned $2 million a year.

At the SSA, Ennis has most recently led efforts to thwart scam Social Security phone calls, at the Interior department she will oversee investigations into Interior’s newly appointed Secretary David Bernhardt's lobbying ties and two ongoing Justice Department investigations into former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke Ryan Keith ZinkeOvernight Energy: Trump appoints Social Security watchdog to also oversee Interior | Critics question EPA guidance on pipelines | Battle over science roils EPA Overnight Energy: Trump appoints Social Security watchdog to also oversee Interior | Critics question EPA guidance on pipelines | Battle over science roils EPA Trump appoints Social Security Administration watchdog to also oversee Interior MORE. One of those investigations has reportedly made it to the grand jury.

The appointment of Ennis to Interior was not formally announced by the White House, however, the Interior Department’s website was updated last week to reflect her new position.

Ennis replaces former acting Inspector General Mary Kendall, who retired from the office at the end of May. Kendall oversaw multiple ethics investigations into Zinke, including recommending a number of them to the Justice Department for further investigation. Those investigations reportedly played a heavy factor in Zinke’s decision to leave the administration early this year.

Ennis is the second Trump political appointee whom the administration has attempted to put in the Interior OIG role.

Earlier this year, Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Ben Carson Benjamin (Ben) Solomon CarsonTrump appoints Social Security Administration watchdog to also oversee Interior Trump appoints Social Security Administration watchdog to also oversee Interior Ben Carson decries 'gotcha' politics: 'Give me a break' MORE announced to staff that Assistant HUD Secretary Suzanne Israel Tufts would replace Kendall. Because Tufts had been previously confirmed by the Senate, she would not have to go through another confirmation process for the role.

However, following backlash to that announcement, the Interior Department later said the announcement was a misunderstanding and Carson reversed the move. Tufts resigned not long after.

“On May 28th, Social Security [Inspector General] Gail S. Ennis started at [Department of Interior] OIG as Acting Inspector General. Continuing with her responsibilities as SSA IG, Ms. Ennis will also lead our organization while Mark Greenblatt’s nomination continues to progress in the Senate,” an OIG spokesperson said in a statement to The Hill.

The White House referred comment to the Interior OIG. The Interior Department did not return a request for comment.

In addition to the ongoing investigations into Interior's current and former secretaries, the OIG is also investigating six high-ranking interior officials for ethics concerns.

Wilmer Hale, the law firm where Ennis previously worked as a partner, lobbies for a number of clients with business before Interior. For example, the law firm represents Twin Metals a Minnesota based mineral mining company that is lobbing to build a hotly debated copper-nickel mine near the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness. In May, the Trump administration moved to renew one of the mine's mineral leases, reversing a decision from the Obama administration.

Ennis, who was not a registered lobbyist, said the Interior OIG ethics office is currently reviewing her former clients.

""DOI OIG General Counsel is conducting a thorough ethics review that will ensure that I do not participate in any matter that would create a conflict of interest or an appearance of a conflict of interest,"" Ennis told the Hill in a statement.

DOJ investigating 'non-governmental organizations and individuals' as part of 'broad' probe into surveillance abuses,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/durham-investigating-non-governmental-organizations-and-individuals-potentially-including-fusion-gps,"As part of its ongoing ""multifaceted"" and ""broad"" review into potential misconduct by U.S. intelligence agencies during the 2016 presidential campaign, the Justice Department revealed Monday it is also investigating the activities of several ""non-governmental organizations and individuals.""

Additionally, the DOJ announced that the probe, let by Connecticut U.S. Attorney John Durham, was looking into the involvement of ""foreign intelligence services."" Former Trump aide George Papadopoulos told Fox News last month that an informant who was likely ""CIA and affiliated with Turkish intel"" had posed as a Cambridge University research assistant in September 2016 and tried to ""seduce him"" to obtain information linking the Trump team to Russia.

The information was contained in a letter to House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., who had inquired as to the scope of Durham's investigation. The letter could indicate that the DOJ is looking closely at work done during the campaign by Fusion GPS, the firm retained by the Hillary Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee (DNC) to conduct opposition research against the Trump campaign.

Fusion GPS, in turn, hired British ex-spy Christopher Steele to produce an unverified and largely discredited dossier that the FBI went on to cite in secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) court applications to surveil former Trump aide Carter Page.

CARTER PAGE: FBI INFORMANT 'INTENSIFIED' COMMUNICATIONS JUST BEFORE FISA WARRANT OBTAINED

Last week, reports indicated Steele had agreed to talk with Durham if certain preconditions were met. Multiple sources familiar with the matter told Fox News, meanwhile, that Durham is “very dialed in” and “asking all the right questions."" Separately, sources within the Justice Department confirmed to Fox News that Barr has met “on multiple occasions in recent weeks” with Durham in Washington, D.C.

Numerous problems with the Steele dossier's reliability have surfaced, including several issues that were brought to the FBI's attention before it cited the dossier in its FISA application and subsequent renewals. Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report made plain, for example, that then-Trump lawyer Michael Cohen did not travel to Prague to conspire with Russian hackers seeking to access Democrat files, as the dossier alleged.

Mueller also was unable to substantiate the dossier's claims that Page had received a large payment relating to the sale of a share of Rosneft, a Russian oil giant.

FMR TRUMP AIDE ALLEGES BOMBSHELL INFORMANT TRIED TO 'SEDUCE' HIM IN 'BIZARRE' EPISODE FOR RUSSIA DIRT ON TRUMP

North Carolina GOP Rep. Mark Meadows told Fox News on Sunday he has seen ""additional documents"" that demonstrate that “prior to the first FISA application, Peter Strzok, Andy McCabe, and others at the FBI knew that Christopher Steele's dossier was not credible.” Internal FBI text messages obtained by Fox News in March showed FBI brass scrambling to respond to a concern from a senior DOJ official about the potential ""bias"" of a key FISA source.

Meadows, speaking to ""Fox News Sunday,"" pointed specifically to a report from The Hill's John Solomon, who found that Ukrainian businessman Konstantin Kilimnik, a key figure in Mueller's report, was actually a U.S. informant. In his report, Mueller linked Kilimnik to Russian intelligence, and did not mention Kilimnik's secretive ties to the U.S. in the report other court filings -- even as Mueller suggested former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort's ties to Kilimnik were nefarious.

""The deeper the dive we take into the Mueller report, we're starting to find out some of the conclusions, and actually some of the facts they put forth in there, are a misrepresentation of what we actually know,"" Meadows said.

Meadows added that he expected DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz's investigation into potential FBI and DOJ surveillance misconduct to come out later than June, when it was originally expected. Meadows said more information has come to light that might necessitate the delay.

Solomon, reporting for the Hill, also recently unearthed a documented conversation Steele had with a State Department contact -- which were relayed to the FBI -- in which Steele claimed the Russians were running a “technical/human operation run out of Moscow targeting the election"" and that ""payments to those recruited are made out of the Russian Consulate in Miami.""

There is no Russian consulate in Miami, a fact the State Department official, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Kathleen Kavalec, emphasized in her notes. Additionally, Steele had suggested his client was ""keen"" to see his information come to light prior to Election Day. Kavalec forwarded her notes to the FBI and other government officials several days before the FISA warrant was issued for Page. Fox News has confirmed The Hill's reporting.

RUSSIAN-BORN UK ACADEMIC SAYS SHE'S BEING USED TO 'SMEAR' MICHAEL FLYNN

Further, in its original FISA application and subequent renewals, the FBI told the FISA court that it ""did not believe"" Steele was the direct source for a Yahoo News article implicating Page in Russian collusion. Instead, the FBI suggested to the court, the September 2016 article by Michael Isikoff was independent corroboration of the dossier.

But London court records show that contrary to the FBI's assessments, Steele briefed Yahoo News and other reporters in the fall of 2016 at the direction of Fusion GPS.

Carter Page has not been charged with any wrongdoing, even though the FBI called him an ""agent of a foreign power"" in its October 2016 FISA application. On Sunday, Page told Fox News' ""Sunday Morning Futures"" that his actions had been ""completely spun in the fake Mueller"" report to help advance what he characterized as Democrats' ""ridiculous"" goal of impeachment.

REUTERS/Ting Shen

(Reuters) - The main U.S. refining industry association said on Monday it sued to block the Trump administration’s effort to expand sales of higher ethanol blends of gasoline, arguing the move exceeded the administration’s authority.

The legal challenge from the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers (AFPM) association escalated a battle between the oil and corn industries over the nation’s biofuel policy, which requires refiners to blend biofuels like corn-based ethanol into their gasoline, often at great expense.

President Donald Trump had directed the Environmental Protection Agency to lift a summertime ban on the sale of gasoline containing 15 percent ethanol, called E15, in an effort to help farmers suffering from the U.S. trade war with China. The EPA unveiled its rule doing so on May 31.

The summertime E15 ban had been implemented during the Obama administration to reduce smog emissions, but Trump’s EPA said E15’s impact on air quality was similar to that of E10, which could already be sold year-round.

The tension over the policy move reflects how Trump has struggled to please both Big Oil and Big Agriculture, two critical constituencies in the Republican president’s 2020 re-election bid.

AFPM asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia to review the EPA’s rule, in papers filed on Monday, said Diana Cronan, a spokeswoman for the group.

AFPM has one month to provide the court with the outline of its case, she said."

CBP told The Hill the subcontractor that had its network breached had not been given permission to transfer CBP photos to its system. CBP has not named the subcontractor, and told The Hill that as of Monday, none of the images involved in the breach has been discovered on the darknet.

Thompson criticized CBP and the Department of Homeland Security in general for allowing the data breach to occur, saying in a statement that the privacy of Americans can’t be compromised.

“Government use of biometric and personal identifiable information can be valuable tools only if utilized properly,” Thompson said. “Unfortunately, this is the second major privacy breach at DHS this year. We must ensure we are not expanding the use of biometrics at the expense of the privacy of the American public.”

A spokesperson for Thompson told The Hill that the committee “hopes to have government witnesses” at the hearings, but had no further details on dates in July the hearings will take place."
'Dangerous Proposal': USDA Seeking to Replace Government Inspectors at Beef Slaughter Plants With Private Employees,https://www.ecowatch.com,"['Common Dreams', 'Jordan Davidson', 'Yes', 'The Revelator', 'Olivia Rosane']",06-11-2019,2019,6,https://www.ecowatch.com/usda-inspectors-deregulation-2638771530.html,"By Julia Conley

In an apparent effort to boost profits for meat manufacturers despite potential harms to food safety, the U.S. Department of Agriculture is reportedly planning to privatize inspections of beef slaughter plants.

""This dangerous proposal could rid beef slaughter plants of most government inspectors,"" Food and Water Watch said in a statement.

The group released an application from beef, pork, and poultry manufacturer Tyson Foods, in which the company requested a waiver to allow Tyson employees to conduct more inspections at its beef plant in Holcolm, Kansas, instead of relying on USDA food safety inspectors.

Food and Water Watch reported Monday that the USDA is pursuing deregulation of the food inspection system that has been used for years at beef slaughterhouses. The information came from documents obtained through the Freedom of Information Act.

BREAKING: We have obtained documents that confirm the USDA is seeking to privatize inspections of beef slaughterhouses. This dangerous proposal could rid beef slaughter plants of most government inspectors. https://t.co/jNospAvLYn pic.twitter.com/cbx4fo6lHy

The documents were uncovered after many recent denials by USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) that it plans to privatize inspections of mass-produced beef, Food and Water Watch stated.

Tyson's proposal comes 21 years after FSIS first launched a pilot program in more than two dozen poultry and pork plants in which government food safety inspectors were replaced by the manufacturers' own inspectors, allowing the companies to regulate themselves.

In 2013, the USDA's inspector general found that the agency ""did not critically assess whether the new inspection process had measurably improved food safety at each plant"" that produced pork.

The following year, FSIS expanded the program to the entire poultry industry. The agency will not conduct an assessment of the new system's effects on food safety until 2022.

""The previous attempts at privatized inspection have led to weaker food safety performance and are a ploy by the industry to increase line speeds,"" said Tony Corbo, a senior lobbyist with Food and Water Watch.

Despite a lack of evidence that the privatized food safety inspection system is making food safer — and CDC data showing that foodborne illnesses from foods including chicken have been on the rise since 2015 — FSIS is weakening standards in order to increase the speed with which meat is processed, allowing for greater manufacturing profits.

""The Tyson plant in Holcomb, Kansas is approved to operate at the current maximum line speed allowable"" said Corbo. ""FSIS management has had difficulty meeting its inspection staffing requirements in the past in western Kansas, which has contributed to beef slaughter plants not being able to maintain maximum line speeds. Tyson's solution seems to be to get rid of the government inspectors."""

Ortagus added that embassies are permitted to hang the rainbow Pride flag or display other Pride images without violating the State Department’s directive, but flag poles should be reserved for the U.S. flag.

She also told reporters that Pompeo “respects the dignity of every individual,” reflected in the Pride celebrations taking place in U.S. embassies.

"Barr compares his return to DOJ to D-Day, likens it to trying to 'land without getting shot'",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Sam Dorman', 'Sam Dorman Is A Reporter With Fox News. You Can Follow Him On Facebook']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/william-barr-doj-return-d-day-shot,"Attorney General William Barr compared his arrival at the Justice Department to the type of situation soldiers faced before D-Day.

""As we've been watching the coverage of June 6, 1944 D-Day, I had the thought that my arrival this time felt a little bit, I think, like jumping into Sainte-Mère-Église on the morning of June 5, trying to figure out where you could land without getting shot,"" he said at the FBI Academy on Friday.

Thursday marked the 75th anniversary of D-Day, the day when Allied soldiers stormed the beaches of Normandy in an effort to challenge the Nazi stronghold in Northern Europe.

DEMS UNVEIL CONTEMPT RESOLUTION FOR BARR, MCGAHN OVER SUBPOENA SNUB

President Trump spent that day at Normandy, commemorating the sacrifice of American veterans as he faced impeachment calls and investigations from Democrats in Congress.

“To more than one hundred and seventy veterans of the Second World War who join us today – you are among the very greatest Americans who will ever live,"" he said.

While in Normandy, Trump also spoke with Fox News about the Russia investigation and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who resisted impeachment but also reportedly said she wanted to see Trump in ""prison.""

“She’s incapable of doing deals, she’s a nasty, vindictive, horrible person, the Mueller report came out, it was a disaster for them,"" he said of Pelosi.

ADAM SCHIFF CONTINUES ATTACK ON BARR, SAYS AG IS 'SECOND MOST DANGEROUS MAN' IN US

Pelosi, who also visited Normandy, refused to discuss impeachment during an interview on D-Day but has repeatedly criticized the administration, especially the attorney general.

Barr, who also served as AG under former President George W. Bush, returned to the Justice Department as Pelosi's party continued pressing the Russia issue and his department faced intense questioning surrounding the investigation.

From the start, Barr was suspected of bias due to a memo he wrote which said he thought Trump was well within his powers when he fired former FBI Director James Comey -- one of the main issues in suspicions surrounding whether the president obstructed justice.

Since his arrival, Barr has taken actions that prompted both media figures and congressional Democrats to accuse him of shielding the president from warranted scrutiny. Barr has also come under fire for pursuing the president's directive to de-classify intelligence material in order to uncover information related to the Russia probe's origins.

HOUSE DEMS TO VOTE ON HOLDING BARR, MCGAHN IN CONTEMPT, SEEKING TO KEEP MUELLER SPOTLIGHT ALIVE

That prompted an inquiry from House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who blasted the AG as unworthy of that title. Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., who also serves on that committee, said that while he was reluctant to impeach Trump, he was ready to pursue that path with both Barr and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin.

Democrats seemed poised to at least hold Barr in contempt as his Department refused to comply with House Democrats request for more information surrounding the investigation.

Citing Barr's refusal, House Democrats proposed giving congressional investigators the power to ""“to initiate or intervene in any judicial proceeding before a Federal Court."" Rules Committee Chairman James McGovern, D-Mass., whose committee would take up the resolution, vowed to hold the administration accountable.

“We will not allow this president and his administration to turn a blind eye to the rule of law,"" he said."
Ken Cuccinelli named acting head of DHS's legal immigration division,https://www.washingtontimes.com,"['The Washington Times Http', 'Stephen Dinan']",06-10-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/jun/10/ken-cuccinelli-named-acting-head-dhss-legal-immigr/,"Former Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli was officially named acting director at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services on Monday, putting him in charge of some of the most important behind-the-scenes immigration initiatives of the Trump administration.

Foremost among his tasks will be to speed changes to a major guest-worker program and to finalize the new “public charge” rules, which are designed to push legal immigrants to prove they can be self-sustaining without becoming dependent on public assistance.

Mr. Cuccinelli, in a statement, pronounced himself “honored” to lead the agency.

“USCIS has the extraordinary responsibility to administer and protect the integrity of our nation’s lawful immigration system,” he said. “Our nation has the most generous legal immigration system in the world and we must zealously safeguard its promise for those who lawfully come here.”

Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan announced Mr. Cuccinelli’s accession to the USCIS job in a statement Monday — though there could be some legal hurdles.

Since Mr. Cuccinelli has not been in the agency, Mr. McAleenan created a new deputy position at USCIS and placed it first in the line of succession, giving him a path to be the new director.

Democrats said that was a cheap-shot end run that might not hold up to court scrutiny.

“Once again, this president is trying to circumvent Congress and our Constitution by appointing someone as acting head of an agency who would not be confirmed by the Senate to that post and who is grossly unqualified for it,” said House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer, Maryland Democrat.

Mr. Cuccinelli had been under consideration for a job as immigration “czar” at the White House, but instead President Trump deputed him over to Homeland Security as an adviser.

Now he lands in a specific job, taking over for Director Francis Cissna, who had fallen out of favor with the White House for not moving fast enough on what top White House advisers said were the president’s top priorities.

Democrats saw Mr. Cuccinelli’s appointment as an attempt to undermine the agency.

“Mr. Cuccinelli is an anti-immigrant fringe figure that has no business leading a component that is supposed to administer our nation’s legal immigration system,” said Rep. Bennie G. Thompson, chair of the House Homeland Security Committee.

The Mississippi Democrat predicted Mr. Cuccinelli would be a force for chaos at the agency, undermining its mission.

And he said there’s no chance Mr. Cuccinelli would be confirmed to the position if nominated to it, so it makes no sense to install him as the acting director.

Mr. Thompson didn’t say which Senate Republicans he thinks would oppose Mr. Cuccinelli and thus prevent his confirmation, but Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell earlier this year told reporters he did not want Mr. Trump to select Mr. Cuccinelli.

Mr. Cuccinelli, as head of a conservative activist organization, backed a challenger to Mr. McConnell in his 2014 election, and in 2017 Mr. Cuccinelli signed onto a letter urging Mr. McConnell to give up the leader’s post.

“America is too good for you to lead it,” Mr. Cuccinelli and fellow conservatives wrote.

Though USCIS gets less attention than the other two immigration agencies, Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, it is instrumental in the enforcement of immigration laws, deciding on legal immigration applications and some visitor visas.

The agency is under fire from Democrats who say that it has slow-walked legal immigration under Mr. Trump, erecting what activists have labeled an “invisible wall” to prevent migration.

Yet USCIS points to increased processing of citizenship applications and to the border crisis, which has spawned a massive surge in asylum petitions, both of which fall to the agency’s officers to adjudicate.

The White House has been demanding stricter asylum standards out of USCIS, saying it could help cut down on the flow of illegal immigrants if it took a more critical eye of the initial claims migrants make at the U.S.-Mexico border.

“One of the biggest frustrations is the fact that USCIS has not been able to change agency culture about ‘credible fear’ and asylum from the Obama years,” a White House official told reporters two months ago, predicting changes at the agency.

Those comments came as Mr. Trump had ousted Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and acting ICE Director Ronald D. Vitiello, seeking a tougher direction from his leaders.

Mr. Cissna survived the initial culling, but White House officials made clear he was on the hot seat.

"EPA cuts 40 regulations, saves $3.6B, seeks balance on costs",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],06-11-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/washington-secrets/epa-cuts-40-regulations-saves-3-6-billion-seeks-balance-on-costs,"Aiming to erase the “fuzzy math” past administrations used to hide the costs of politically favored policies, the Environmental Protection Agency is pulling back the curtain on costs and benefits, and planning to kill regulations that are out of whack.

“It hopefully will take away some of the fuzzy math that administrations have done in the past on justifying regulations,” said EPA Administrator Andrew R. Wheeler of his new policy.

And, he added, it will set a new bottom-line for all regulations in the rules heavy agency. “If the costs are too high we should change the regulatory approach. We shouldn’t be having regulations that cost more than the benefits they provide,” he said in an interview.

With the new rules will come unusual transparency and a pledge to make public the costs and benefits of regulations coming out of the environmental agency.

“It will provide more confidence in the regulatory process,” said Wheeler.

And, he added, “Hopefully there will be fewer people upset with EPA, upset with the federal government.”

The new effort in Wheeler’s policy memo, titled “Increasing Consistency and Transparency in Considering Benefits and Costs in the Rulemaking Process,” is aimed at opening the door to the secretive regulation process and ending suspicions that politics drives policy.

“I really do hope it depoliticizes it,” said Wheeler.

President Trump campaigned on a promise to cut two Obama-era regulations for every new one he proposes. The EPA has led that effort, cutting far more than 2-1 for a total savings to taxpayers of $3.6 billion, Wheeler said. Since Trump came into office, the EPA has cut 40 major regulations and plans to axe another 49, he said.

“We are definitely at the top” of regulation killers, he added.

The new memo to assistant administrators said that regulations on the Clean Air Act will come under scrutiny first.

While Wheeler’s actions may sound like common sense, many EPA laws only “contemplate the consideration of benefits and costs as part of the regulatory decision-making,” said his memo.

Now, he wrote, “the EPA should evaluate and consider both benefits and costs in decision-making.”"

Private attorney and GOP activist Brady Toensing is leaving Vermont to take a senior counsel position with the U.S. Department of Justice. He starts work for the Office of Legal Policy Monday.

Toensing, 51, announced his resignation as vice chair of the Vermont Republican Party on May 23. An activist lawyer, advocate for open government and head of President Donald Trump’s Vermont campaign committee in 2016, Toensing has long been a thorn in the side of moderate Republicans, iconoclastic lefty U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders and the Democratic establishment in Vermont.

Get all of VTDigger's daily news. You'll never miss a story with our daily headlines in your inbox.

“We are going to miss Vermont, but I am excited to be joining the Department of Justice in a dream job and under the leadership of Attorney General Bill Barr,” Toensing said in an email. “Our youngest is graduating from high school this week, so the timing is pretty good.”

Deb Billado, chair of the Vermont Republican Party, said his seat will remain vacant until the party reorganizes in November. “It’s certainly an opportunity that doesn’t come along every day for lawyer and I’m excited for him,” Billado said.

Toensing and Billado have been Trump stalwarts, pushing away moderate Republican Party members, including Gov. Phil Scott who has rebuffed many of the president’s policies.

Toensing’s connection to Trump runs deep. Last year the president considered retaining Toensing’s mother and stepfather, prominent conservative D.C. attorneys Victoria Toensing and Joseph diGenova, to be part of his team handling the investigation led by special counsel Robert Mueller.

Over the past five years, Toensing has fought with the state’s most prominent politicians in the press and the courts over the state’s gun laws, climate change initiatives, accusations of campaign finance abuse and the state’s refusal to produce public records. He also waded into public disputes with U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, Gov. Peter Shumlin, and former Vermont Attorney General William Sorrell, accusing them of misconduct.

TJ Donovan, who took Sorrell’s place when he was elected Vermont attorney general in 2016, says Toensing has been a worthy adversary. Donovan appointed him to the Vermont Campaign Finance Task Force in 2017.

VTDigger is underwritten by:

“I said to him I hope you’re not leaving Vermont for good, that we need lawyers like Brady in our state,” Donovan said in an interview Monday. “He can be a pain in the butt no doubt, but he holds government officials accountable — he was a worthy adversary, he was tough, he was dogged and he was fair.”

“Brady and I have been fighting for the past three years so my sense is our fights will continue,” Donovan said. “But I also think it’s useful, I will have somebody I can call and have a reasonable conversation with — I anticipate calling upon Brady as issues arise … I have respect for his legal acumen and his integrity.”

Others on the left of the political spectrum weren’t as generous in their appraisal of Toensing’s contributions to the legal and political landscape.

State Sen. Chris Pearson, P/D-Chittenden, who was the subject of one of Toensing’s several campaign finance complaints leveled at liberals, said “he really does epitomize the modern Republican ethic of winning at all costs.”

“I know how hard it is to recruit people to run for office and to serve and when they look at the kind of harassment that can entail at the hands of people like Brady Toensing that discourages more people from being engaged,” Pearson said. “At the same time he’s vigorously defended transparency and the public’s right to know, there’s a tension there I think.”

Most recently, Toensing served as local counsel in a case brought by the National Rifle Association against the state of Vermont over the constitutionality of a new magazine limit put in place last year as part of sweeping reforms to the state’s gun laws.

Toensing won a landmark First Amendment case in 2018. The Vermont Supreme Court ruling set a new precedent making the private emails of officials pertaining to government business subject to public records requests. In that lawsuit, the Charlotte attorney represented the interests of the Free Market Environmental Law Clinic and the Energy and Environment Legal Institute, conservative groups funded by the Koch brothers, that were seeking information about a group of state attorneys general offices — including Vermont’s — investigating Exxon Mobil’s alleged early knowledge and longtime denials of climate change.

Toensing is perhaps best known for his 2016 letter to the U.S. Department of Justice alleging that Sanders pressured People’s United Bank to issue a loan requested by his wife, Jane Sanders, the former president of Burlington College, for the purchase of the former Roman Catholic Diocese of Burlington headquarters on Lake Champlain. Last fall, the Vermont U.S. Attorney’s Office dropped an investigation into whether Jane Sanders overstated donor pledges used as collateral for the loan.

Toensing also went after then-Vermont Attorney General William Sorrell in 2015 for alleged campaign finance violations when he accepted $200,000 from a PAC set up by the Democratic Attorneys General Association in his 2012 primary against Donovan. Sorrell was accused of improperly coordinating with the PAC. A special investigator found in 2017 that DAGA — not Sorrell — ran afoul of Vermont campaign finance rules.

When former Gov. Peter Shumlin came under criticism for taking advantage of his neighbor Jeremy Dodge in East Montpelier, Toensing represented Dodge pro bono and helped him reclaim his land.

And then there were the campaign finance cases.

When Sanders promoted former staffer Pearson’s campaign for the state Senate in an email to supporters in 2016, Toensing cried foul. He alleged that the email was an in-kind contribution that generated an $80,000 windfall from 12,000 Sanders fans and therefore violated campaign finance laws.

In 2011, Toensing defended former Republican Lt. Gov. Brian Dubie when he was accused of misusing campaign finance laws by allegedly coordinated with the Republican Governors Association on a poll. In a settlement, Dubie paid $10,000 to the state and $10,000 to the Vermont Foodbank. The RGA settled for $30,000.

Toensing holds an undergraduate degree and obtained a juris doctorate from Georgetown University in 1996. He worked for U.S. Sen. Warren Rudman after law school and then went into private practice. Toensing has represented plaintiffs and defendants in gender discrimination cases, and CIA and FBI employees in internal hearings and investigations, according to a bio on his law firm’s website.

Since 2010, he has represented the former president of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International through multiple lawsuits involving allegations of international money laundering and bank fraud.

His mother, Victoria Toensing, and his stepfather, Joseph DiGenova, are prominent conservative Washington lawyers and fierce advocates for Trump. A recent Politico piece characterized the “husband and wife duo” as the staunchest defenders of the president on TV. Toensing and DiGenova were such a dominant media presence in the Lewinsky affair that Washington Post dubbed them the “Power Couple at the Scandal’s Vortex.”

Battle over science roils EPA,https://thehill.com,[],06-09-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/447520-battle-over-science-roils-epa,"Environmental Protection Agency is battling its own board of science advisers over its controversial plan to dismiss certain types of scientific research from consideration when issuing rules.

A meeting this week between the agency and some of the nation’s top scientists highlighted the growing rift between the EPA and the scientific community, with members of the Science Advisory Board (SAB) pushing back on the administration's efforts to bar consideration of studies that don't make their underlying data public.

Critics say the move would omit important research from EPA consideration and lead to a dramatic rollback of existing regulations.

The SAB, a team of more than 40 of the nation’s top scientists, have been asking to weigh in on the controversial proposal since it was unveiled more than a year ago.

On Wednesday, it said it would do so —despite a request from the agency to review a narrow portion of the rule.

There’s mistrust between the scientific community and EPA’s leaders in the Trump administration.

That spurred scientists to call the proposal “censored science.”

EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler Andrew WheelerOvernight Energy: Trump appoints Social Security watchdog to also oversee Interior | Critics question EPA guidance on pipelines | Battle over science roils EPA Overnight Energy: Trump appoints Social Security watchdog to also oversee Interior | Critics question EPA guidance on pipelines | Battle over science roils EPA Battle over science roils EPA MORE on Wednesday appeared before the board, vowing to improve the relationship between it and the agency.

“I’ll be the first to admit that we have not utilized you in ways that we should. We can and we will do better,” Wheeler said.

But many in the science and environmental community walked away from the meeting disheartened at what they see is the agency’s plan to amplify pet policies and the voices of industry over those from scientists.

“I would say the way that the meeting proceeded kind of contradicted a lot of Administrator Wheeler’s statement at the beginning of the meeting,” said Genna Reed, lead science and policy analyst with the Union of Concerned Scientists. “Their discussion showed that EPA has not really involved the Science Advisory Board and gotten their advice on several of the deregulatory actions they’ve proposed.”

Scientists have had a number of concerns over how the Trump administration values science, but things really came to a head when the EPA announced the science transparency rule without first consulting the SAB.

The group didn’t find out about the rule until it was publicly announced — a sign, scientists and environmentalists say, the EPA was not interested in meaningful feedback.

The proposal has since proven to be one of the most controversial EPA has written, prompting 600,000 comments. Critics say the rule will exclude some of the most important research from consideration simply because it does not rely on data that can be shared publicly.

The board sent a letter in May of 2018 with a number of questions and asking to weigh in on the rule but it took almost 11 months before the agency responded in April of this year.

Wheeler apologized for the delay Wednesday, saying it was the result of the agency taking time to rethink how it wants to work with the board going forward.

He asked the board to give its thoughts on how the agency can deal with studies that don’t make their data public because it includes confidential business information or personally identifiable information.

The board bucked that request and instead voted to review the proposal in its entirety.

“I’m wondering if any of the comments the EPA received gave you pause about proceeding with that rule?” asked Barbara Morrissey, chair of a separate EPA panel, the Children’s Health Protection Advisory Committee.

“I agree the confidentiality issue in an important and a thorny one so I’m glad that you referred that to us, but I’m concerned about whether the best available science can be ignored because it can’t be replicated for obvious reasons,” she said, nodding to studies of people who were exposed to harmful chemicals.

Watchers of the board were surprised by the vote given how the makeup of the board has changed under the Trump administration.

Fears that the EPA planned to sideline scientists started under Pruitt when he announced that scientists who receive grants from the EPA would not be allowed to serve on the board—a move that knocked out about half of the members sitting on the Science Advisory Board.

Reed with the Union of Concerned Scientists said there are pretty much two types of grants available to scientists—those from the EPA and those from industry. She didn’t understand why getting an EPA grant would present a conflict of interest when an industry grant wouldn’t.

“People who received these no strings attached grants and are experts on some of the most pressing environmental issues are kept from serving on the board,” she said. “It’s clearly a political maneuver to change the composition of these advisory committees.”

Twenty six of the 45 current board members were appointed during the Trump Administration, a huge amount of turnover in a board that otherwise loses under a fifth of its members each year due to term limits.

“I was pleasantly surprised,” Chris Zarba, who served as the former staff coordinators for SAB until last year, said of the vote to review the entire science transparency rule. It’s not that the Trump administration picks aren’t qualified, he said, but a good board needs diversity.

“Think of it this way. If I was picking a world class football team, and I only picked people that were world class, top-ranked players — if all those people I picked were field goal kickers, I’d never win a game,” he said. “It’s hard to question any single member on the board, and by law the administrator can pick anyone they want and any member that is qualified, but the bigger question is: is the entire team well equipped and accurately representing mainstream science? I think we will see how it turns out...There are certainly picks I wouldn't have recommended to the administrator.”

Robert Phalen is one Trump administration pick that has been questioned by scientists for views of air pollution that are out of line with most mainstream scientists. The University of California Irvine professor told the American Association for the Advancement of Science that “modern air is a little too clean for optimum health.""

Phalen was one of the few at the meeting to vote against reviewing the science transparency rule in its entirety.

“I can see and respect both sides of the debate on transparency,” he told The Hill in an email. “We need to know if the research used for regulations is free of serious errors, and that requires other scientists having access to the data. On the other hand if the data were widely available it could be improperly used, such as for disclosing private information. So both sides have validity.”

Wheeler said the agency will move forward with something, assuring the board that the administrator will always have the power to give an exemption to an important study, even if it can’t disclose all its data.

“I do fundamentally believe the more information we put out to the public as far as what is the basis for our regulatory decisions, the more sound our decision will be and the more easily understood and accepted by the public our decision will be because they see all the science we are using,” he told the board."

ATCHISON, Kan. -- Most history classes teach Zachary Taylor was the 12th U.S. president and Harry Truman was the only president from Missouri.

But a pair of historical markers in Plattsburg, Missouri, and a museum in Atchison, Kansas, tell a different story.

People pass by the towering statue outside the Clinton County Courthouse every day. Few people recognize it as David Rice Atchison, and likely fewer understand the plaque below that declares him ""President of the United States for one day.""

""He was this vital important pre-Civil War person that pretty much vanished off the pages of history,"" said Chris Taylor, Atchison County Historical Society executive director.

But on March 4, 1849, Atchison was the nation`s highest ranking elected official sworn into office.

The nation's 11th president, James Polk's term had expired, and the President-elect, Zachary Taylor, refused to be inaugurated on a Sunday.

Atchison of Missouri had just been named president pro tempore of the U.S. Senate.

""In 1849, there was no pressing thing that would happen. Today, if we didn't have a president for 24 hours, the whole world would be in total chaos,"" Taylor said.

The Atchison County Historical Society Museu boasts ""The World's Smallest Presidential Library.""

In its Hall of Presidents, Atchison is placed between Polk and Taylor and proclaimed ""The Real 12th President."" It features a 1849 newspaper article from Washington D.C.'s National Intelligencer that explained how Atchison may have accidentally become president for a day.

The museum asks visitors to vote in a 1850s Kansas ballot box what they'd do if they were president for a day.

So how did Atchison spend it? After being up for dozens of hours signing final presidential orders that had to pass through the Senate from the previous term, he mostly slept.

""His friends started showing up to wake him up to be appointed as ministers to different countries or part of his 24-hour cabinet, so people realized this odd thing was happening,"" Taylor said.

Atchison never gained the official title of vice president either, but would serve in the de-facto capacity under two presidents because of deaths in office. He'd retire from politics shortly after Atchison, Kansas, was named for him, on the losing side of the debate whether Kansas should be admitted as a slave or free state.

A marker next to his Plattsburg, Missouri, grave declares him ""President for a Day."" Memoirs say he'd often boast after his odd attachment to history that he had ""the honestest administration in the U.S.""

Since 1849, whenever Inauguration Day has fallen on a Sunday, the president has been sworn in privately, and then had a formal public ceremony the following day."
Lawmakers try to save DHS lab that prepares first responders for terror threats,https://www.cnn.com,['Geneva Sands'],06-10-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/10/politics/dhs-lab-first-responders-funding-house/index.html,"(CNN) Lawmakers are again attempting to keep a Department of Homeland Security laboratory that specializes in first-responder technology and assistance from shutting its doors.

The House overwhelmingly passed a bill Monday evening that would permanently authorize the New York City-based National Urban Security Technology Laboratory, which has been at risk of losing funding over the past couple of years and was not included in the administration's latest DHS funding request.

The lab ""is constantly developing and testing new tools for our brave first responders to use in the event of a terrorist attack, industrial accident or natural disaster and closely collaborates with law enforcement agencies like the FDNY, NYPD and the Nassau County Police Department in my district,"" Rep. Kathleen Rice, a New York Democrat who cosponsored the bill, said Monday on the House floor, urging her colleagues to pass the legislation. The final vote was 395-3.

She said the administration has proposed closing the lab in each of the last two federal budgets.

The potential funding cut comes amid budget battles between the White House and Democrats on Capitol Hill, as the administration has shifted its funding and influence to the department's immigration missions.

Justice Department strikes deal to give House Democrats evidence obtained by Robert Mueller,https://www.salon.com,[],06-10-2019,2019,6,https://www.salon.com/2019/06/10/justice-department-strikes-deal-to-give-house-democrats-evidence-obtained-by-robert-mueller/,"The Department of Justice has agreed to provide Congress with some evidence collected by Robert Mueller that could zero in on possible obstruction of justice by President Donald Trump, the House Judiciary Committee announced Monday.

The exact scope of the material the Justice Department has agreed to turn over was not immediately clear.

""These documents will allow us to perform our constitutional duties and decide how to respond to the allegations laid out against the president by the special counsel,"" Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., the committee chairman, said in a statement.

Nadler said he expected the department to begin sharing some of the material later Monday and noted that all members of the panel would be able to view the documents privately.

The development marks an unexpected breakthrough in the negotiations between the House Judiciary Committee and the White House over access to evidence obtained by Mueller throughout his nearly two-year investigation into Russian election interference in the 2016 election, alleged ties between the Trump campaign and Moscow and whether the president obstructed justice.

Discussions between the Trump administration and the House Judiciary panel appeared to come to a halt last month after the committee voted along party lines to hold Attorney General William Barr in contempt of Congress for failing to comply with a subpoena to turn over Mueller's full report and underlying evidence — material which members of the House Judiciary Committee said they need to conduct an obstruction of justice investigation into the president. Trump also asserted executive privilege over Mueller's findings on the attorney general's recommendation.

Nadler's announcement comes a day before the House is scheduled to vote on a resolution on whether to hold Barr and White House counsel Don McGahn in contempt of Congress for defying congressional subpoenas related to Mueller's report. He said Monday that he would ""hold the criminal contempt proceedings in abeyance for now.""

If the Justice Department, Nadler added that ""proceeds in good faith, and we are able to obtain everything that we need, then there will be no need to take further steps."" But, if important information is held back, he said, ""we will have no choice but to enforce our subpoena in court and consider other remedies.""

Rep. Doug Collins of Georgia, the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee, praised the Justice Department for turning over the documents, which he said ""debunks"" claims the White House is stalling Congress in their oversight efforts.

""The Justice Department has yet again offered accommodations to House Democrats, and I am glad Chairman Nadler — for the first time in months — has finally met them at the negotiating table,"" Collins said in a statement. ""In light of today's agreement from the Justice Department, it's logical to ask: Is the chairman prepared to rescind his baseless recommendation to hold the attorney general in contempt, or do House Democrats still plan to green-light lawsuits against the attorney general and former White House counsel tomorrow?"""
Top U.S. diplomat for Africa to travel to Sudan to urge talks: State Department,https://www.reuters.com,"['Reuters Editorial', 'Min Read']",06-10-2019,2019,6,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-sudan-politics-usa/top-us-diplomat-for-africa-to-travel-to-sudan-to-urge-talks-state-department-idUSKCN1TB2IV,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. top diplomat for Africa will visit Sudan this week to meet with a transitional military council and the country’s civilian opposition to urge talks, the State Department said on Monday.

Talks between the two collapsed last week when security forces stormed a sit-in that had been the focal point of Sudan’s protest movement for nearly two months.

Tibor Nagy, the U.S. assistant secretary for Africa, will also discuss a political solution for Sudan during a visit to Ethiopia, whose Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has tried to mediate between the military council and protest movement.

“He will call for a cessation of attacks against civilians and urge parties to work toward creating an enabling environment ... for talks to resume,” the State Department said, adding that Nagy will later travel to Mozambique and South Africa."
VA owes $190 million to disabled veterans improperly charged home loan fees,https://www.foxnews.com,['Robert Gearty'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/va-owes-190-million-to-disabled-veterans-improperly-charged-home-loan-fees,"The Department of Veterans Affairs owes about $189 million to 53,000 disabled veterans who were charged home loan fees they were exempt from having to pay, an investigation has found.

These veterans were charged the fees under the VA’s Home Loan Guaranty Program and now may be entitled to refunds ranging from $5,000 to $20,000, a VA Inspector General audit released Thursday found.

VA loan managers knew disabled vets were being charged the fees improperly since 2014 but never did anything about it, VA IG auditors determined.

“OIG finds it troubling that senior (Veterans Benefits Administration) management was aware that thousands of veterans were potentially owed more than $150 million yet did not take adequate actions to ensure refunds were issued,” the IG report says.

DOZENS OF ATTORNEYS GENERAL ASK BETSY DEVOS TO FORGIVE DISABLED VETS STUDENTS LOANS

The loan managers told the IG they were focused on other priorities, including processing high volumes of applications, USA Today reported.

The report faulted the Veterans Benefits Administration for placing the burden on a disabled vet to submit a claim for a refund.

The VA announced last month that it was notifying veterans when they buy homes through the Home Loan program that they are exempt from the fees if they are disabled or later determined to be disabled, the paper reported.

“Through an internal quality improvement effort, VA has put a plan in place to better inform veterans through key communications when the law allows VA to waive the fee for a veteran,” the announcement quoted VA Secretary Robert Wilkie as saying.

The Veterans Benefits Administration told the IG that it would identify exempt veterans who paid the fees and issue them refunds and that the financial impact to the veterans was minimal over the life of the loan, The Washington Post reported.

(KCRG File)

Felicia Sadler, of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, wrote the letter saying that the department intended to close the file on the city's Project Civic Access agreement. That program helps ensure cities and counties comply with the ADA. Cedar Rapids entered the agreement to participate on September 1, 2015.

The file was closed after the city showed sufficient progress and evidence that work will continue to get the city into ADA compliance. Officials believe that most of the work will be done in the next few years.

The city said that over 4,000 curb ramps had been installed, and various adjustments made at parks and other city facilities."
EPA getting common sense with cost-benefit analysis,https://www.washingtontimes.com,"['The Washington Times Http', 'Daren Bakst']",06-10-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/jun/10/epa-getting-common-sense-with-cost-benefit-analysi/,"ANALYSIS/OPINION:

Shouldn’t Environmental Protection Agency regulations do more good than harm?

The agency hasn’t always thought so.

In 2012, under President Barack Obama, the EPA finalized a rule to reduce emissions of mercury and other hazardous air pollutants from coal- and oil-fired power plants. In doing so, the agency decided that it didn’t need to consider the rule’s costs, estimated at $9.6 billion per year — roughly 2,000 times more than its annual benefits of only $4 million to $6 million.

Fortunately, the U.S. Supreme Court directed the agency to take costs into consideration based on specific Clean Air Act language applicable to that rule. If the EPA had its way though, costs wouldn’t have been considered.

That cavalier attitude is evident in other major air regulations, where the EPA didn’t bother to quantify whether there would be any benefits for reducing emissions of the regulated pollutant.

Now, however, there’s reason to hope that some common sense might finally be coming to the EPA.

In May, EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler issued a memorandum directing the agency to “ensure that its regulatory decisions are rooted in sound, transparent and consistent approaches to evaluating benefits and costs.”

The full scope of what this process will entail isn’t clear. However, it appears that various offices within the EPA will be proposing rules to codify important principles of cost-benefit analysis into the agency’s work.

The memo explains that “the EPA should evaluate and consider both benefits and costs in decision-making.” The fact that such an obvious point has to be made is sadly instructive.

This entire effort shouldn’t be, and doesn’t appear to be, a scheme to reduce regulations per se. But the need for a reasonable, objective and predictable way to make regulatory decisions is quite evident.

Regulators shouldn’t be allowed to work backwards, deciding what policy they want and then gaming (or ignoring) cost-benefit analysis to reach their preferred policy outcomes. By codifying basic regulatory principles through the rule making process, the EPA will have a more difficult time going back to the “anything goes” mentality that exists now.

There must be a reasonable and transparent process in how the EPA comes up with their regulations. Make no mistake, these EPA regulations have a major impact on the lives of all Americans. In addition to environmental objectives, these regulations impact everything from energy costs, infrastructure development and transportation, to whether a farm includes some dry land that is actually a regulated water under the Clean Water Act.

In moving forward with this process, the EPA should codify basic principles of cost-benefit analysis that have been well-established over the years through various means, including executive orders and Office of Management and Budget documents.

For example, the agency should carefully evaluate to what extent existing regulations or laws contribute to the problem that the agency wants to address. The EPA should also evaluate alternatives to regulation and choose an alternative that achieves the regulatory objective while posing the least burden on society.

The EPA should identify where regulations are outdated, duplicative and unnecessary. Further, unless expressly prohibited in statute, the EPA should assume that cost-benefit analysis is required across the board.

As with the EPA, Congress delegates far too much power to other agencies and is arguably unlawfully delegating its lawmaking power. This is certainly a critical problem that needs to be addressed.

But to the extent agencies are able to exercise this enormous and largely unchecked power, there should be some reasonable rules of the game so that their decision-making is based on sound economic principles. This in no way should suggest that cost-benefit analysis is a panacea for sound policymaking, but applying reasonable principles is far better than having none at all.

To its credit, the EPA is taking on this important endeavor to help ensure the agency properly and consistently considers costs and benefits, now and in the future. Other agencies should follow suit.

US Commerce Department official killed in DC in apparent murder-suicide,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],06-09-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/us-commerce-department-official-killed-in-dc-in-apparent-murder-suicide,"A U.S. Department of Commerce official was killed Friday in what police have said is a murder-suicide, according to multiple reports.

"Treasury Secretary Mnuchin says the bond market is telegraphing a Fed rate cut, not a recession",https://www.cnbc.com,['Michael Sheetz'],06-10-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/10/mnuchin-bond-market-telegraphing-a-fed-rate-cut-not-a-recession.html,"Investors have been warning that the bond market is indicating a deteriorating economic outlook, but Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin disputed that interpretation in CNBC interview.

Mnuchin believes that falling bond yields, rather than warning of a recession, are indicating that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in the coming months. Bond yields fell to 20-month lows last week after government data showed U.S. job creation slowed more than expected in May.

""I would say that the bond markets are predicting ... a lowering of interest rates,"" Mnuchin said in an interview Sunday on CNBC's ""Street Signs Asia. ""

Mnuchin noted that he did not intend to comment on whether interest rates should be lowered, saying that he wants ""to respect"" the independence of the Federal Reserve. Mnuchin meets weekly with Fed Chairman Jerome Powell. On Monday, President Donald Trump told CNBC the Fed made a mistake raising rates in December and is ""very disrputive"" to the economy.

Investor expectations of a June rate cut from the Fed rose last week to 27.5%, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool. The market gives July a 79% chance of a Fed rate cut.

Mnuchin said the global economy is now in an environment where ""interest rates are very low around the world,"" which is what investors are ""seeing in the U.S. bond markets."" But the Treasury sees ""no signs of a recession"" in the U.S. economy, Mnuchin said, even as his department is ""somewhat concerned about what we see as a slowdown in Europe, China and other areas of the world.""

""We still see the growth in the U.S. as really quite strong,"" Mnuchin added."
