Trump Asserts Executive Privilege on 2020 Census Documents,https://www.nytimes.com,"['Charlie Savage', 'Julie Hirschfeld Davis']",06-12-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/12/us/politics/us-census-2020-trump.html,"“This begs the question,” Mr. Cummings added: “What is being hidden?”

At the White House, Mr. Trump defended his administration’s push to include a citizenship question in the 2020 census: “When a census goes out, you should find out whether or not — and you have the right to ask whether — somebody is a citizen of the United States,” he said as he met with Poland’s president, Andrzej Duda.

But in an Oversight Committee meeting on Capitol Hill, Democrats demanded to see the deliberations behind the question, and they pointed to Mr. Trump’s declaration months ago that he intended to defy all congressional subpoenas. In the census investigation, they said, the administration had provided little more than unresponsive documents and stonewalling of critical deposition requests.

“It is indeed laughable” to say that the administration had cooperated with the panel, said Representative Stephen F. Lynch, Democrat of Massachusetts, brandishing a blacked-out page with no text visible as an example of the heavily redacted material the Commerce Department had sent. “We’ve reached our limit.”

In separate letters from the Justice Department and the Department of Commerce, administration officials maintained they had already turned over many materials in response to the subpoena, but that they had to keep certain information confidential to protect the candor of internal and attorney-client deliberations. Still, both officials made it clear that the privilege assertion was in retaliation for the panel’s insistence on issuing contempt citations for Mr. Barr and Mr. Ross.

“The Department regrets that you have made this assertion necessary by your insistence upon scheduling a premature contempt vote,” the letter from the Commerce Department said."
"Kamala Harris: If elected, my DOJ would have 'no choice' but to prosecute Trump",https://www.foxnews.com,['Ronn Blitzer'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/kamala-harris-if-president-doj-would-have-no-choice-but-to-charge-trump,"2020 candidate Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., has issued a stunning warning to President Trump that seems to echo controversial recent comments from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, saying her Justice Department would likely charge him with obstruction of justice if she wins the White House.

Harris, in a newly released interview, said she believes the only reason former Special Counsel Robert Mueller did not recommend prosecuting Trump was because of the Justice Department’s policy against indicting a sitting president. Once out of office, Trump would be subject to charges -- and Harris was emphatic in saying the DOJ should pursue them.

DEMS' LONG GAME? PELOSI RAISES PROSPECT OF PROSECUTING TRUMP ONCE HE LEAVES OFFICE

“I believe that they would have no choice and that they should, yes,” Harris said on this week’s NPR Politics Podcast.

The former California attorney general and San Francisco district attorney cited the importance of holding everyone accountable for their actions.

“I mean look, people might, you know, question why I became a prosecutor,” Harris said. “Well, I’ll tell you one of the reasons – I believe there should be accountability. Everyone should be held accountable, and the president is not above the law.”

Harris is not the first high-profile Democrat to suggest that not only should Congress pursue impeachment against Trump -- but he should face criminal charges once out of office.

Pelosi, D-Calif., reportedly told colleagues last week: “I don’t want to see him impeached, I want to see him in prison.”

REP. WARREN DAVIDSON: PELOSI MENTIONED TRUMP IMPRISONMENT TO ‘KEEP IMPEACHMENT ZEALOTS IN LINE’

Trump reacted to this by calling Pelosi ""a nasty, vindictive, horrible person.""

Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., however, had no problem with Pelosi's remarks.

""I don’t have any difficulty with those words,"" Cicilline told ""Fox News Sunday,"" comparing them to when then-candidate Trump inspired ""lock her up"" chants when he ran against Hillary Clinton. A 2018 New York Times report also said that Trump looked into prosecuting Clinton, as well as former FBI Director James Comey.

Joining the chorus of Democrats hinting that prosecuting Trump might be appropriate was another 2020 candidate, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. The progressive Democrat said recently that Trump would be ""carried out in handcuffs"" if he were anyone else, though she did not openly advocate charges against him.

Asked Wednesday if he would advocate Trump's prosecution, fellow candidate Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., said “no one is above the law” while leaving the question open.

“To be very blunt, if my attorney general at the Department of Justice finds that there is probable cause that a law has been broken by anyone, I expect him to hold the alleged offender accountable no matter who they are or what title they’ve held in the past,” he said. “I’m not going to be a president that undermines the independence of the DOJ or the judiciary in a way that I’ve seen this administration do.”

"New poll shows Biden beating Trump by a ""landslide""",https://www.cbsnews.com,[],,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/new-national-poll-says-bidens-lead-over-trump-is-of-landslide-proportions/,"A new national poll from Quinnipiac University shows President Trump trailing each of six Democratic candidates in potential head-to-head contests and calls Joe Biden's advantage of ""landslide proportions.""

The Democrats' lead ranges from five points for Cory Booker and Pete Buttigieg to 13 points for Biden. In between, Bernie Sanders leads Mr. Trump by nine points, Kamala Harris by eight, and Elizabeth Warren by seven.

Interestingly, while Biden beats Mr. Trump by a landslide in the Quinnipiac poll, his lead among his Democratic competitors has narrowed since April. One Iowa Democrat CBS News spoke to said she's happy to have a lot of great options but some think maybe a little too many.

The president and former vice president traded sharp words in Iowa Tuesday where, as CBS News' Ed O'Keefe reports, it appears like the two are already campaigning as if it's November 2020. Both have repeatedly traded barbs since the former vice president jumped into the 2020 race, but as the Quinnipiac indicates, Biden isn't the only Democrat the president has to worry about.

""I'd rather run against, I think, Biden than anybody. I think he's the weakest mentally. And I like running against people that are weak mentally. I think Joe is the weakest up here,"" Mr. Trump said.

The president's focus on Biden is strategic. CBS News has learned that polling conducted by the Trump campaign shows the president trailing the former VP in several key states and Biden's approach seemed to resonate.

""He thinks these tariffs are being paid by China, just like he thinks Mexico is building the wall,"" Biden said to applause Tuesday.



But Iowa voters also say they're hungry for policy proposals.

""I don't vote for a persona, I vote for what are you going to do,"" one Iowa voter said.

Mr. Trump knows voters aren't yet sold on Biden. The president's campaign also believes Elizabeth Warren is gaining strength, and sees a path for Bernie Sanders. So for now, President Trump is an equal opportunity opponent."
"Schiff hammers ‘collusion’ narrative at latest Russia hearing, as GOP slams 'grotesque spectacle'",https://www.foxnews.com,['Adam Shaw'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/schiff-hammers-collusion-narrative-at-latest-russia-hearing,"House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff, D-Calif., sought Wednesday to keep the fire burning over Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report with the latest in a series of hearings on the Russia controversy -- as Republicans voiced frustration over what they described as a “grotesque spectacle” on Capitol Hill.

Schiff called the hearing to examine what he called the “disturbing findings” of Volume One of Mueller’s report. That volume focused on allegations that the Trump campaign colluded with Russian officials during the 2016 campaign.

EX-NIXON AIDE JOHN DEAN TESTIFIES ON WATERGATE-RUSSIA 'PARALLELS' AS GOP MOCKS APPEARANCE

“Volume one of the report outlines a sweeping and systemic effort by Russia to interfere in the 2016 election for the benefit of Donald Trump,” Schiff declared. “It establishes that the Trump campaign welcomed the Russian interference because it expected to benefit electorally from the information stolen and released through the Russian effort.”

While he said that most Americans would consider the actions of the campaign and Russian officials to “constitute plain evidence of collusion,” he noted that the report did not find evidence sufficient to support criminal conspiracy charges.

“Nevertheless and contrary to the president’s often-repeated mantra and many misrepresentations of the attorney general, the special counsel reached no conclusion as to whether the Trump campaign’s many Russian contacts constituted collusion since that term is not defined in criminal law.”

The hearing featured two former FBI officials while Republicans invited former federal prosecutor and Fox News contributor Andrew McCarthy to testify. McCarthy told the panel that Russia wasn’t backing Trump per se in the 2016 campaign, and was rather supporting the candidate seen at the time as most likely to lose.

“[Russian President Vladimir] Putin tends to back the candidates he believes will lose on the theory that an alienated losing faction will make it harder for the winning faction to govern,” he said.

“It is a mistake, I respectfully submit, to allow him to divide us by portraying him as on one side or another. He’s against all of us.”

But the sharpest remarks came from Ranking Republican Devin Nunes, R-Calif., who said that Democrats’ claims of collusion had been “exposed as a hoax.”

“One would think the Democrats would simply apologize and get back to lawmaking and oversight but it's clear they couldn't stop this grotesque spectacle even if they wanted to,” he said.

“After years of false accusations and McCarthyite smears, the collusion hoax now defines the Democratic Party,"" he said. ""The hoax is what they have in place of a governing philosophy or a constructive vision for our country.”

The spat was the latest example of fraying tensions between lawmakers from opposing parties over the Russia probe. Democrats are keen to continue investigating the actions of the Trump campaign and alleged obstruction of justice, and a number have opened the door to possible impeachment. Democrats on Tuesday passed a civil enforcement resolution that members say effectively holds Attorney General William Barr and former White House counsel Don McGahn in contempt of Congress, pertaining to another dispute related to the Russia investigation. The DOJ pushed back and said it was not a civil contempt vote.

DONALD TRUMP JR. SAYS 'NOTHING TO CORRECT' AS HE RETURNS FOR SENATE COMMITTEE TESTIMONY

Meanwhile, Republicans in Congress have supported the Trump administration’s push to investigate the origins of the Russia probe.

DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz is expected soon to issue his report on possible surveillance abuses during the 2016 campaign -- including how the Democrat-funded anti-Trump Steele dossier was used to secure surveillance warrants on former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page. Barr has launched a separate investigation into the origins of the probe.

On the Senate side, Donald Trump Jr. also visited Capitol Hill Wednesday for a second closed-door interview with that chamber’s intelligence committee. He appeared in response to a subpoena from the panel’s Republican Chairman Richard Burr, R-N.C.

Trump Jr. told reporters he had “nothing to correct” regarding his prior testimony as he arrived. He was expected to be asked about plans to build a Trump Tower in Moscow, as well as a meeting in New York's Trump Tower with a Russian lawyer that initially had promised dirt on Hillary Clinton.

Wednesday's House hearing came two days after John Dean, former White House counsel to President Richard Nixon, testified to the House Judiciary Committee that parts of the Mueller report “echo Watergate” -- comments that drew mockery and anger from Republicans.

""In many ways, the Mueller report is to President Trump what the so-called Watergate road map…was to President Richard Nixon,” Dean said, adding Mueller “has provided this committee a road map.”

But as a number of Democrats have eyed possible impeachment of the president, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said this week that such a move is “not even close” to having enough support in the House.

DOJ antitrust chief warns Big Tech that low prices or free products won't protect them,https://www.foxnews.com,['Christopher Carbone'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/tech/doj-antitrust-big-tech-low-prices-free-products-wont-protect,"The Justice Department's assistant attorney general highlighted the antitrust case against Silicon Valley's major players during a Tuesday speech.

Makan Delrahim described a range of possible arguments against tech companies as his office takes the lead in probing Google and, possibly, Apple. Separately, the Federal Trade Commission is overseeing inquiries into possible antitrust practices of Facebook and Amazon.

After discussing the breakup of Standard Oil in 1911, the 1982 dissolution of AT&T into the ""Baby Bells"" and the government's successful monopoly case against Microsoft in 2001 – which arguably helped lay the foundation for the success of Google and Yahoo – Delrahim explained several arguments that could be made against the world's most powerful tech companies on antitrust grounds.

Offering Low Prices or Free Services

Critics have pointed out Amazon's undeniable power in the area of American e-commerce and its foray into the world of bricks-and-mortar retail, but the company's defenders note the consistently low prices it offers on a gigantic array of consumer goods. In addition, Facebook and Google offer a multitude of services for free.

WHY IS NANCY PELOSI IGNORING FACEBOOK CEO MARK ZUCKERBERG?

But Delrahim said the Justice Department takes a much broader view.

""The Antitrust Division does not take a myopic view of competition. Many recent calls for antitrust reform, or more radical change, are premised on the incorrect notion that antitrust policy is only concerned with keeping prices low,"" he said in his speech at the Antitrust New Frontiers Conference. ""It is well-settled, however, that competition has price and non-price dimensions.""

Besides price, ""diminished quality"" is a factor the Justice Department would consider.

""As an example, privacy can be an important dimension of quality. By protecting competition, we can have an impact on privacy and data protection. Moreover, two companies can compete to expand privacy protections for products or services, or for greater openness and free speech on platforms,"" Delrahim said.

Exclusive Agreements

Delrahim said the Antitrust Division has a history of investigating ""exclusive conduct"" under Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act.

""[Exclusivity agreements] also can be anticompetitive, however, where a dominant firm uses exclusive dealing to prevent entry or diminish the ability of rivals to achieve necessary scale, thereby substantially foreclosing competition,"" he said. ""This is true in digital markets as well.""

SOCIAL MEDIA CONTRIBUTES TO RADICALIZATION, TOP TWITTER EXEC SAYS

The Justice Department's antitrust case against Microsoft focused in part on that company's inclusion of its own browser in its Windows operating system, which the federal agency found discouraged users from seeking alternatives.

“This theory is broadly applicable to other technology markets,” Delrahim added.

CREEPY DEEPFAKE AI LETS YOU PUT WORDS INTO SOMEONE ELSE'S MOUTH

Swallowing Up Competitors

Facebook and Google have gobbled up hundreds of other companies – some of them former competitors – over the last two decades. Delrahim indicated that this type of behavior could be considered anticompetitive.

“It is not possible to describe here each way that a transaction may harm competition in a digital market, but I will note the potential for mischief if the purpose and effect of an acquisition is to block potential competitors, protect a monopoly, or otherwise harm competition by reducing consumer choice, increasing prices, diminishing or slowing innovation, or reducing quality,"" he said. ""Such circumstances may raise the Antitrust Division’s suspicions.”

According to The New York Times, Google has acquired at least 270 companies over nearly two decades, including YouTube, which was a competitor to Google Video; Waze, which competed with Google Maps; and DoubleClick, which had been the tech giant's chief advertising competitor.

Facebook has acquired 92 companies since 2007, including Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014. The Menlo Park, Calif. based company also bought and shut down other social networks, including Gowalla, Beluga and Nextstop, the Times reports.

AMAZON'S SECOND NEW YORK GO STORE SERVES COFFEE, ACCEPTS CASH

Still, Delrahim said that acquisitions can be positive if they ""combine complementary technologies or bring products and services to market that would not have been made available to consumers otherwise.""

Although these investigations may take years to complete, Delrahim made it clear that the Justice Department is taking a serious look at Silicon Valley's main players.

""While antitrust is not a panacea for every policy challenge presented by the digital market, the Antitrust Division will not shrink from the critical work of investigating and challenging anticompetitive conduct and transactions where justified,"" he said. ""That is because where competition is harmed, consumers and markets lose with higher prices, lower quality, lower rate of innovation, less free speech and even lower privacy protections.""

"Democrats accuse Trump of creating ‘phony’ emergency to secure arms deals with Saudis, UAE",https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Karoun Demirjian', 'Congressional Reporter Focusing On National Security', 'June At Pm']",06-12-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/house-lawmakers-to-grill-state-department-over-trumps-arms-sales-to-saudi-arabia-uae/2019/06/12/9bbc148e-8d05-11e9-adf3-f70f78c156e8_story.html,"The House Foreign Affairs Committee split along partisan lines Wednesday over how sharply to criticize the State Department for finalizing 22 arms sales despite congressional objections, as Democrats accused the Trump administration of creating a “phony” emergency to funnel weapons to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.

“Here’s the reality: there is no emergency,” said panel chairman Rep. Eliot L. Engel (D-N.Y.), one of several Democrats furious with the administration’s moves. “It’s made up. And it’s an abuse of the law.”

R. Clarke Cooper, the assistant secretary of state for political-military affairs, told the panel that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had been responding to a “significant increase” in threats from Iran, coupled with “the clear, provocative, damaging actions taken by Iran’s government” when he announced the Trump administration would use its emergency authority to advance the arms deals worth about $8 billion.

“It was a measured response which promotes regional stability and security,” Cooper said.

But Democrats were not having it — and Republicans were clearly uncomfortable with having been circumvented, though their rebukes were more measured.

“The recent use of this emergency authority, in my judgment, was unfortunate,” said the panel’s ranking member, Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Texas), adding: “Consulting with Congress is always the better route.”

Members of the House committee are preparing four disapproval resolutions to try to block the arms deals from going forward. A bipartisan group in the Senate also is pushing for a vote on 22 disapproval resolutions and is expected to demand a vote on the measure early next week.

[Trump’s arms deals benefiting Saudi Arabia to face their first test in Congress]

It is unclear, though, if either approach will be able to overcome an expected veto from President Trump, who has continued to embrace Saudi leaders even in the face of bipartisan backlash on Capitol Hill.

Trump’s stance has thus far stymied congressional efforts to pull back U.S. military support to Saudi Arabia, to constrain its controversial intervention in Yemen’s civil war, or impose sanctions in response to its leaders’ role in the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a Washington Post contributing columnist who was slain in the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul in October.

Against that backdrop, Pompeo’s emergency order to complete the arms deals last month struck many lawmakers as surprising and offensive, not simply for supplying Saudi Arabia and its allies with weapons at a time when most lawmakers in Congress are advocating holding such materiel back, but also for the breadth of the order.

House Democrats grilled Cooper Wednesday about whether the president or his son-in-law, Jared Kushner — who has a close relationship with Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman — had played a role in the emergency declaration, or hashing out the terms of the arms deals ahead of time. Cooper denied that Kushner had.

They also questioned why Pompeo had not briefed lawmakers on his plans. The secretary met with all senators and House members behind closed doors just three days before the emergency declaration to discuss the threats posed by Iran, which, Cooper testified, precipitated the emergency declaration.

“Which came first, the arms sales, or the threat?” Engel asked Cooper — pointing out that acting defense secretary Patrick Shanahan told lawmakers during the May 21 briefings that the threat from Iran had spiked, but was in decline.

Cooper’s attempt to assuage lawmakers by telling them the State Department valued engagement with Congress came as a particular affront to Democrats, who questioned why they should trust that the Trump administration would not repeat this practice for future arms deal.

“This is gaslighting,” Rep. David N. Cicilline (D-R.I.) said.

Cooper refused to answer in the public setting several questions regarding the timeline and purpose of individual arms sales, leaving Democrats to question whether the administration was trying to arm Saudi Arabia for either a regional war or an escalation of its military campaign in Yemen by shipping it offensive weapons that could be used to target civilians. McCaul, the panel’s top Republican, joined Democrats in questioning how critical the emergency could be if it would take months or years to complete certain weapons deals.

While it is unclear if Congress will be able to build enough bipartisan support to block these 22 deals in the face of a presidential veto, the administration’s move has compelled leading Democrats and Republicans to discuss changing the law governing Congress’ role in approving such sales.

Even one of the president’s closest allies on Wednesday endorsed the idea of taking away the president’s emergency powers.

“Do away with the emergency exception,” said Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.). “I would not have agreed to that before, but after this maneuver by the administration, count me in.”"
"DHS chief reveals startling stat on asylum seekers who skip hearings, disappear",https://www.foxnews.com,['Adam Shaw'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dhs-secretary-reveals-startling-stat-on-asylum-seekers-who-skip-hearings-disappear,"The acting Homeland Security secretary gave lawmakers a glimpse Tuesday into just how many asylum seekers skip their hearings after being released into the United States -- telling a Senate panel that a recent program found 90 percent miss their court dates.

Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., asked Acting Secretary Kevin McAleenan how many asylum seekers coming across the southern border show up for their hearings.

BORDER ARRESTS SKYROCKET IN MAY, AS OFFICIALS DECLARE 'FULL-BLOWN EMERGENCY'

“It depends on demographic, the court, but we see too many cases where people are not showing up,” he said, telling Graham that DHS recently conducted a pilot program with family units.

“Out of those 7,000 cases, 90 received final orders of removal in absentia, 90 percent,” he said.

“90 percent did not show up?” Graham asked.

“Correct, that is a recent sample from families crossing the border,” McAleenan clarified.

McAleenan’s testimony also painted a grim portrait of a border crisis that shows no signs of easing, with Border Patrol overwhelmed and underfunded. The secretary described authorities as hamstrung by laws that limit how long they can keep migrants in custody.

“Currently due to a single district court order, we cannot obtain effective immigration enforcement results for the families arriving at our border -- they cannot be held for longer than 21 days and do not receive rulings from immigration courts for years,” he said.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection reported that it encountered 144,000 migrants at the border in May, a level not seen in decades, describing the situation as a “full-blown emergency.” McAleenan said that 60,000 children have entered into DHS custody in just the last 40 days.

McAleenan told lawmakers they also suffer due to “misaligned” asylum standards, meaning many of those who demonstrate “credible fear” of returning home -- the initial bar for claiming asylum -- are later judged not to have a valid asylum claim.

PELOSI HITS TRUMP'S DEAL WITH MEXICO, ACCUSES HIM OF 'THREATS AND TEMPER TANTRUMS'

He also said the restrictions on how long family units can be held mean that a child is now seen as a passport to the U.S. -- a perception he said is based in reality. He testified that only 30 percent of those coming to the border are actually trying to avoid being captured.

“Unless you’re a single adult, it is very unlikely you’ll be repatriated,” he said.

McAleenan urged Congress to act to end those loopholes and to grant requested DHS funding, and suggested that moves to make asylum seekers claim asylum in their home countries or designated third-countries could help solve the crisis.

Graham’s “Secure and Protect Act of 2019,” being discussed at the hearing, would include a provision to establish refugee processing centers in Mexico and Central America, and the senator asked the DHS chief if such an approach would work.

“First of all, it would break the back of the smuggling organizations, they’re profiting from this cycle.” McAleenan said. ""It would provide access to asylum in country in a much safer manner than taking this dangerous journey and it would stop this flow immediately.”

“I believe the vast majority [of the migrant flow] would stop,” he said.

Democrats, meanwhile, suggested that the administration bears some of the blame for the situation at the border, with Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., pointing to McAleenan's recent appointment as an example of dysfunction at the department.

“In less than two and a half years, there have already been four heads of this department, we have before us an acting secretary who has been on the job for more than two months,"" he said. ""We cannot face this crisis effectively with a revolving door policy in the leadership at the Department of Homeland Security.”

McAleenan’s testimony comes amid continued negotiations between the Trump administration and Mexico on immigration. The U.S. announced on Friday that it had reached a deal with Mexico to drop threatened tariffs on Mexican imports in exchange for Mexico increasing efforts to limit U.S.-bound migration flows from Central America.

An administration source told Fox News Tuesday that a new deal for Mexico becoming a safe third country for asylum seekers was completed, but not yet announced.

“Seventeen admitted or were tested out as fraudulent,” McAleenan testified. “This is a 15 percent return.”

McAleenan also said that special agents with forensic interview skills interviewed 1,568 family unites and found that 242 families “were fraudulent.”

“I don’t think we can ignore these numbers,” he said.

McAleenan clarified that the statistics don’t necessarily mean that 15 percent of all families trying to cross the border are misrepresenting unrelated minors as blood-related offspring.

He said the families tested were targeted referrals by border patrol agents who were suspicious about certain migrants borrowing or renting children to get into the United States more easily.

Durbin, an outspoken advocate for immigrant rights, acknowledged there was “no excuse” for misrepresenting children to fraudulently gain asylum.

“We should not ignore them. There is no excuse, none, for mispresenting a child as your own in an effort to defraud anyone in our country or any other place,” Durbin said. “But this notion that we can somehow dismiss the 85 percent of children because some are abusing that representation of parental responsibility troubles me greatly.”

Earlier in the hearing, McAleenan said border investigators found a 51-year-old migrant paid $80 to rent a 6-month-old child to get across the border.

“We’re very concerned about the incidents of fraud. We think it’s a huge part of this cycle, and it’s caused by the fact that they know if they come as a family they’ll get special treatment at the border,” he testified.

The Treasury Department issued final regulations on Tuesday severely limiting the benefit to taxpayers who donate to municipal charitable funds in lieu of paying state and local taxes. New Jersey authorized municipalities to set up such funds, though no town has yet to do so.

The rule first was proposed in August, drawing criticism then from New Jersey state and federal officials. New brickbats were thrown after the final regulations were issued.

“This seems to be a massive giveaway to the moocher states and another whack at states like New Jersey,” said Rep. Josh Gottheimer, D-5th Dist.

Top Trump officials meddled with IRS to make sure you wouldn’t get a full property tax break, inspector general says The decision centers on the total amount that can be claimed if taxpayers donate to a charitable fund in lieu of paying state and local taxes.

The agency had for years approved such charitable accounts to allow taxpayer subsidies for private schools. However, this time top Trump administration officials, in an action the Treasury inspector general for tax administration called a departure from normal procedure, inserted themselves into the debate over municipal charitable funds.

“The IRS has allowed these charitable funds for decades and is only now banning them because states like New Jersey sought to utilize them and establish its own,” said U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez, D-N.J., a member of the tax-writing Senate Finance Committee.

The new rule leaves the tax breaks for private and religious schools in place, saying that “state tax credits and state tax deductions should be treated differently.”

Nathan Diament, executive director of the Orthodox Union Advocacy Center, said the new rule ad other anticipated actions “are implementing the president’s promises to support school choice in the United States.”

The Trump tax law targeted the federal deduction for state and local taxes. Residents of New Jersey and other high-tax state, most of which send billions of dollars more to Washington than they receive in services, had primarily benefitted from those deductions.

New Jersey taxpayers sent $21.3 billion more to Washington in 2017, second only to New York’s $35.6 billion, according to the most recent report from the State University of New York’s Rockefeller Institute of Government.

The law, which provided most of its benefits to corporations and wealthy Americans, has had little impact on economic growth, according to the Congressional Research Service, even as it was projected to increase the federal deficit by $1.9 trillion over 10 years.

Rep. Bill Pascrell Jr., a member of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, said the fight isn’t over.

“The Republican tax law, the GOP’s signature achievement of the last two years, was passed to bring deliberate pain to states like New Jersey,"" said Pascrell, D-9th Dist. “We will not rest in seeking ways to help our constituents counter the impact of Republicans’ vicious policies.”

Gov. Phil Murphy said on Twitter that the state would not give up, saying the IRS “made clear it is not interested in fairness for New Jersey’s taxpayers.”

In an exclusive interview with ABC News Live, before a rare joint appearance on Capitol Hill, former EPA administrators William Reilly, Lee Thomas and Christine Whitman warned that recent gains in cleaner air and water in the U.S. are beginning to ""backslide.""

""If we continue business as usual, it's catastrophic,"" said Reilly, who led the agency under President George H.W. Bush. ""We're the number two emitter in the world after China.""

Whitman, a former New Jersey governor who ran the EPA under President George W. Bush, raised concerns about ""the disrespecting of science in the administration and the undermining of science and the importance of science.""

Thomas said his old boss, President Ronald Reagan, would have wanted the agency to recommit to its central purpose.

""Change the direction, change the management and go back to the mission of the agency. That's what I think President Reagan would say, 'That's not how I want this agency to operate,'"" Thomas said.

Three Republican former @EPA chiefs join me for an exclusive joint interview @ABCNewsLive on the state of the agency and our #climate. 3:30/5:30/6:30p ET https://t.co/t5KL0KMFpQ or @ABC on Hulu, Roku, Facebook, Apple TV pic.twitter.com/ioQg8e339q — Devin Dwyer (@devindwyer) June 11, 2019

The trio spoke with ABC News before a House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee hearing Tuesday on the direction of the EPA, which was created in 1970 by Republican President Richard Nixon to protect the human health and the environment. Former Obama administration EPA chief Gina McCarthy also testified.

Asked to grade the performance of the current EPA leadership, led by Administrator Andrew Wheeler, the three Republicans agreed on ""D"" or ""a little lower.""

""You need an agency that is credible, has consistency in its rule making and is science-based,"" said Thomas, who lamented a steady exodus of career employees from the EPA because of disillusionment with its current direction.

ABC News

When ABC News Live spoke with Wheeler earlier this year, he insisted that the agency remains focused on its core purpose but is balancing other economic priorities. He said he does not believe climate change is a ""hoax,"" as President Donald Trump has insisted, but also does not think it's the ""crisis"" many environmentalists make it out to be.

""That's an unfair characterization,"" said Reilly of Wheeler's position, noting that the agency's own National Climate Assessment has painted a dire picture of the situation.

""The Green New Deal did something really wonderful,"" he said. ""I am told by so many Republican members of Congress that they are never asked about climate when they go on the stump. And now, they're asked. That is marvelous. It's put it on the agenda.""

Whitman agreed.

""For the first time in my memory, an environmental issue is going to be a major part of a political campaign for the presidency,"" she said. ""I haven't seen that before, and it's not going to go away, and that's good.""

"DOJ slams latest committee contempt vote, warns of retaliation",https://www.washingtontimes.com,"['The Washington Times Http', 'Stephen Dinan']",06-11-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/jun/11/doj-slams-latest-committee-contempt-vote/,"The Justice Department warned Tuesday that it could retaliate against the House Oversight Committee should the panel vote this week to pursue contempt of Congress proceedings against Attorney General William P. Barr, saying it would sour what cooperation there has been.

Assistant Attorney General Stephen E. Boyd said the department has turned over thousands of pages of documents to the Oversight Committee but Chairman Elijah Cummings‘ quick trigger finger on the contempt vote is ruining that.

“Should the committee take the unnecessary and counterproductive step of proceeding with a contempt vote, the department will be forced to reevaluate its current production efforts in ongoing matters,” Mr. Boyd wrote.

He also warned that Mr. Cummings‘ vote won’t end up getting the congressman what he wants.

If the committee does pursue contempt, President Trump will assert a protective executive privilege over the documents Mr. Cummings is trying to get. That would effectively shield them all, while government lawyers look them over, Mr. Boyd suggested.

Mr. Cummings, in a reply letter Tuesday, said Republicans were making demands and issuing threats without offering any accommodations or promises that they will turn over documents if the committee delays its action.

“The committee cannot accept these terms,” he said. “The committee has a responsibility under the Constitution to conduct rigorous oversight of the census, and we will not continue to delay our efforts due to your ongoing obstruction.”

Mr. Cummings suspects shenanigans behind the move to add the citizenship question to the 2020 census — a contention several federal judges have backed up with their findings in several court cases.

The legality of the citizenship question is now pending before the Supreme Court.

Republicans argue Mr. Cummings is trying to sway the justices by orchestrating the contempt vote.

Mr. Boyd said that when Congress demands documents from the administration there is supposed to be an accommodation, where both sides work through privileges and other issues that arise.

He said that didn’t happen in this case.

In particular, he said, Mr. Cummings refused to allow a Justice Department lawyer to attend a deposition of a top department official — leading Mr. Barr to order the official not to testify.

The department released a legal opinion last month justifying Mr. Barr’s stance, saying the Obama administration held the same position.

Homeland Security’s Jeanette Manfra is coming to Disrupt SF – TechCrunch,https://techcrunch.com,[],06-12-2019,2019,6,https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/12/jeanette-manfra-disrupt-sf/,"We can’t talk cybersecurity without hearing from the government.

We’re thrilled to announce Homeland Security Assistant Director Jeanette Manfra, a senior executive at the department’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), will be at Disrupt SF.

Manfra is one of the federal government’s most experienced cybersecurity civil servants. She currently leads CISA’s cybersecurity efforts in protecting and strengthening the country’s most important infrastructure, like the power grid and water supplies. A decade-long government career professional, she previously served as acting deputy under secretary for cybersecurity at the National Protection and Programs Directorate, a division of Homeland Security dedicated to protecting government networks and critical infrastructure, later absorbed by CISA after the agency was created by President Trump in November 2018.

Prior to Homeland Security, Manfra served in the U.S. Army as a communications specialist and a military intelligence officer.

For years, cybersecurity warfare was somewhat limited to governments attacking governments. But the threat landscape has changed, and the new battleground is both in government and in the private sector.

Now under one roof, CISA acts as the nation’s cybersecurity risk adviser — working closely with government departments to protect federal systems and networks, and private industry to advise and warn on ongoing and emerging threats.

The agency has recently doubled down on its efforts to ensure election security, as well as risks to the U.S. supply chain.

Cybersecurity is one of those universal topics that affects every consumer, business, enterprise and government. We’re excited to talk shop with Manfra about the state of the security union.

The Energy 202: 'Just do your jobs': Ex-EPA chiefs go off on Trump administration,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Dino Grandoni', 'Reporter Covering Energy', 'Environmental Policy', 'June At Am']",06-12-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-energy-202/2019/06/12/the-energy-202-just-do-your-jobs-ex-epa-chiefs-go-off-on-trump-administration/5d00011a1ad2e55f2de7c082/,"THE LIGHTBULB

""Afraid."" ""Concerned."" Or just plan ticked off.

That is what past leaders of the Environmental Protection Agency said they felt when they think about the direction the agency has taken under President Trump.

Four former EPA chiefs — three Republicans and one Democrat — spent Tuesday criticizing the EPA's shrinking size and ambition in testimony on Capitol Hill, saying the agency has moved away from its core duties under Trump, The Post's Brady Dennis and I reported.

“I’m deeply concerned that five decades of environmental progress are at risk because of the attitude and approach of the current administration” Christine Todd Whitman, a Republican who led the agency during the George W. Bush administration, told lawmakers on the House Energy and Commerce Committee.

""Climate change is real, and the administration is abdicating its responsibilities by denying it,"" added Whitman, once the governor of the coastal state of New Jersey.

Similar worries dominated the testimony of Gina McCarthy, who led the EPA during the final years of the Obama administration and has been an outspoken critic of the current one.

Like Whitman, McCarthy bemoaned the exodus of longtime EPA employees and what she calls the sinking morale of many career staffers. She and others raised questions about whether the Trump administration is adequately relying on science to drive its policy decisions, and said the White House is ignoring the threat of climate change amid an aggressive push to scale back environmental regulations.

And for McCarthy, the Trump administration is in the process of rolling back her own work.

“I’m here for one reason and one reason only, and it’s not to weep about all my precious rules being rolled back. Although I admit that the constant roll back is beginning to tick me off a bit,"" McCarthy said. ""Maybe even more than just a bit.""

""I’m here to remind the political leadership at the EPA that what they do matters, and it’s time for them to step up and to do their jobs. Just do your jobs,"" she continued, adding the current EPA seemed to value lowering costs to industry more than safeguarding public health.

The EPA did not respond to a request for comment on the testimony. Earlier this year, the agency touted its work during the first two years under Trump, highlighting dozens of deregulatory actions and saying that it had “continued to deliver on its promise to provide greater regulatory certainty while protecting public health and the environment.”

The Hill hearing was intended to “address the mission and future” of the agency, according to Rep. Frank Pallone Jr. (D-N.J.), the committee chairman. It comes after seven past EPA chiefs, representing Republican and Democratic administrations, wrote to House lawmakers in April, offering Congress help with oversight of the agency.

“We are united that there has never been a more important time for us to put aside our differences and advocate collectively for public health and the environment,” they wrote in the letter, which was first reported by E&E News.

The letter was signed by the EPA’s first administrator, William Ruckelshaus, a Republican who also has been critical of the Trump administration’s approach, as well as a host of other past leaders.

The ex-EPA chiefs, who served under Reagan, Obama and both Bushes, pressed Congress to use its oversight power to rein in the current deregulatory push and to ensure the EPA relies on science over politics in its actions. House Democrats who invited the former officials echoed their concerns and promised they are already looking into the rollback of air and chemical rules.

“The four former administrators with us this morning truly know what is at stake and how to accomplish EPA’s mission,” Pallone said.

Some Republicans on the committee criticized McCarthy’s management of the EPA for what they saw as exceeding her authority, pointing to the EPA’s efforts to drastically slash emissions from coal-fired power plants.

“Under her leadership, I think the EPA went rogue,” Rep. David B. McKinley (R-W.Va.) said.

Other Republicans emphasized how often their constituents, many of whom are rural farmers, have to contend with difficult-to-understand regulations on pesticides and fertilizers. And at times, the former administrators acknowledged the challenges of making the public understand their work.

“It’s not an accident that the president can say the kind of things he said about wanting to break up EPA into little bits,” said former administrator William Reilly, who served under George H.W. Bush.

But Reilly still expressed apprehension with what he sees as the pro-industry direction the agency has taken, with its revisions to Obama-era air pollution rules on mercury and methane.

He noted that while the EPA needs to consider the ""economic impact"" of its actions, ""the environment and health come first.""

Lee Thomas, a Republican who led the EPA from 1985 to 1989, compared the current EPA management to the tenure of Anne Gorsuch Burford — Reagan’s controversial first EPA administrator.

Burford, the mother of Supreme Court Justice Neil M. Gorsuch, resigned amid sharp budget cuts, a rift between political and career staff and a scandal over mismanagement of the Superfund cleanup program.

“EPA in 1983 was in the middle of chaos and turmoil,” Thomas said. “There were six different congressional committees that were investigating what was going on at EPA … There was a deregulatory agenda. There was an attack on science at many levels.”

“All that sound familiar?” he added. “ Well there’s an awful lot of that going on today.”

POWER PLAYS

— 2020 watch: Joe Biden told a Greenpeace activist he supports having a climate-focused presidential debate. “We should,” Biden said when asked on a ropeline after a speech in Iowa. “I think that’s what we should be doing. …Yeah, I’m all in. Take a look at what I’m talking about – and by the way, the first climate change plan in the history of the Congress? Biden.”

The context: “Biden has been at pains to emphasize his devotion to climate action, especially since an aide was quoted as saying Biden would take a ‘middle road’ to fighting climate change — a characterization he strongly disputes,” The Post’s David Weigel reports. Biden’s remarks make him the 15th Democratic candidate to endorse a climate debate.

Meanwhile: The chair of the Democratic National Committee defended his decision not to hold a single-issue debate. He called climate change an “urgent threat” and insisted he’s “confident that climate change will receive more attention than ever before — and deservedly so.” But he said “[t]o amend these rules now, after having enforced them throughout this primary process, would be putting our thumb on the scale,” he said in a post on Medium. “If we change our guidelines at the request of one candidate who has made climate change their campaign’s signature issue, how do we say no to the numerous other requests we’ve had?”

In response: Democratic contender and Washington Gov. Jay Inslee (D), who is running on a climate change platform, said the DNC “won’t recognize the climate crisis as an existential threat, but instead has chosen to treat it as a pet issue of one candidate.”

Trump in Iowa: While speaking at the Southwest Iowa Renewable Energy in Council Bluffs, the president touted his work on ethanol while taking a jab at Biden. “I fought very hard for ethanol,” Trump told the audience. “Under the previous administration, our leaders rejected American energy and they rejected ethanol.""

Biden fires back: The former vice president criticized the Trump administration’s tariffs between the United States and China, which he said “crushed” the state’s farmers, during remarks in Iowa, The Post’s Matt Viser, John Wagner and Jenna Johnson report. “[Trump] thinks he’s being tough,” Biden said. “Well, it’s easy to be tough when someone else is feeling the pain.”

Biden's legacy on ethanol: The ex-vice president ""was considered instrumental in orchestrating the blending cuts as a way to help struggling refineries on the East Coast deal with rising compliance costs under the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard,” per Reuters. “A federal court struck down the cuts in 2016. But the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has yet to make the biofuel industry whole for the lost gallons despite repeated promises to do so.”

— It'll be harder for China to choke the U.S. of “rare earth” minerals than it thinks: Amid escalating trade tensions between Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping, China is threatening to hold these minerals hostage as retaliation. The elements are linchpins of many high-tech products such as wind turbines, electric vehicles and nuclear reactors. And China’s share of global production was at more than 97 percent in 2010, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.

But: According to The Post's David J. Lynch, the U.S. economy is more resilient to such a rare-earth ban than it appears. New mines in California, Australia and Myanmar have shrunk China's production share to 71 percent last year. And any embargo won't be foolproof, with rogue operations in China last year producing an estimated 60,000 tons of rare earths.

— Democratic chair wants an explanation for the suppression of congressional testimony on climate: House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) sent letters to the State Department and Office of the Director of National Intelligence demanding more information about the White House’s suppression of written testimony about “possibly catastrophic” consequences of climate change. The Post first reported last week that the White House blocked a State Department intelligence agency from submitting written testimony to Schiff’s committee about the national security threat from human-driven global warming. “

If these reports are accurate, I applaud your Bureau for standing by its analysts and the integrity of its analysts and the integrity of their work in the face of political pressure, but the Committee remains gravely concerned about the events surrounding [bureau senior analyst Rod Schoonover]’s withheld written testimony,” he wrote in the letter to State Assistant Secretary Ellen McCarthy, who oversees the State Department’s Bureau of Intelligence and Research.

Schiff’s demand: The chairman called for details about communications with the White House on any review process for the written testimony as well as testimony from McCarthy or other officials to explain the basis for Schoonover’s analysis.

He reportedly agreed to the interview because he thought it was with his hometown newspaper, the Glenwood Springs Post Independent. He spoke briefly about climate change and about national parks, mentioning that he recently saw structures in Acadia National Park that are “literally crumbling.” “You may go look at a campground and charcoal grills are falling down, the amenities don’t work, the water doesn’t turn on when you turn it on,” Bernhardt said, telling the publication he’s hoping to address park maintenance by raising entry fees and visitor costs.

— Adrift in the Arctic: This fall, scientists will launch the largest Arctic research expedition ever, to document how climate change is affecting the fastest-warming region on Earth, as The Post’s Sarah Kaplan reports from Utqiagvik, Alaska. “What the scientists discover during their year in the frozen north will help them forecast the future of the entire planet,” she writes. “Struggling on the sea ice off Alaska during their training this April, they get a taste of how tough the task will be. They are steeling themselves for what awaits at the pole: profound isolation and protracted darkness, laborious experiments, cold that can plunge to 45 degrees below zero. There are countless ways the Arctic might thwart and threaten them at every turn.”

By the numbers: It will take one year and $134 million and will be part of a 17-nation project. The Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate, a 387-foot research station, is scheduled to launch on Sept. 20 and will see a rotating set of 300 meteorologists, biologists, oceanographers and ice experts.

— A “new climate regime”: A study published this week in the journal Earth’s Future warned about a “new climate regime” with “extraordinary” heat waves, The Post’s Jason Samenow reports. He points to heat waves that killed hundreds and hospitalized thousands across the Northern Hemisphere last summer, a pattern that may be part of a new normal. “The study’s modeling analysis, conducted by researchers in Switzerland and the United Kingdom, found heat events like last summer’s do ‘not occur in historical simulations’ and ‘were unprecedented prior to 2010,’ ” he adds. “As the climate warms, the study projects that the area affected by heat waves like last summer’s will increase 16 percent for every 1.8 degrees (1 Celsius) of warming.”

But that ethics pledge expires in August. | J. Scott Applewhite/AP Photo energy & environment Colorado mine’s ties to Interior secretary unsettle tourist town The mine’s array of powerful allies is inspiring deep unease among leaders in Glenwood Springs.

The Mid-Continent quarry has sat for decades in the hills of western Colorado, where kayakers paddle the Roaring Fork River and tourists soak in the natural hot springs. But now a proposed expansion of the 16-acre limestone mine has kicked off a battle that stretches to the office of Interior Secretary David Bernhardt, whose former employer is lobbying for the project.

The mine's owner, Rocky Mountain Resources, is led by CEO Chad Brownstein, whose father chairs the major lobbying firm where Bernhardt worked for a decade. Bernhardt’s old firm is pushing the mining proposal on two fronts, according to interviews and POLITICO’s review of public records — pressing local government leaders to endorse the project, while meeting in D.C. with Interior staff who could decide the expansion’s fate.

Story Continued Below

Bernhardt promised nearly two years ago to recuse himself from decisions involving his former firm’s clients. But that ethics pledge expires in August, freeing him to work on those issues. An Interior spokesperson would only refer to that pledge when asked whether he’d recused himself from the mine's proposal, and declined to say what action he may take when the pledge expires.

The mine’s array of powerful allies is inspiring deep unease among leaders in Glenwood Springs, a community of 10,000 people whose outdoor tourist attractions include hot springs, whitewater rafting, fly fishing and scenic mountain trails. Residents worry that the expansion, which would allow the mine to spread across 440 acres, would bring a surge of truck traffic, dust and noise — as well as the scarring on the mountain ridge that would become visible from the town. And they say the mine is already violating its permits.

The dispute also follows months of questions from House Democrats and Interior’s internal watchdog about whether the department is taking actions that benefit Bernhardt’s former employer, Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck.

“We’re acutely aware of Chad Brownstein and the relationship to David Bernhardt,” said Jeff Peterson, executive director of Glenwood Springs Citizens Alliance, a group formed to oppose the mine expansion. “It’s something unfortunately we can’t control. But there’s a real concern that this will get essentially rubber stamped and it doesn’t matter what it will do to our community.”

Glenwood Springs Mayor Jonathan Godes agreed.

“Our concern is that there is going to be one of the largest mines in Colorado directly abutting our city,” Godes said. “And when you have a former lobbyist for one of the largest legal lobbying firms in the extractive industry running DOI ... and Norm Brownstein the father of the CEO of Rocky Mountain Resources, it doesn't take a huge leap of faith to say something ain’t right here.”

Just the sheer lobbying firepower Rocky Mountain Resources is bringing to the project may be enough to pressure Interior employees, said Daniel Stevens, executive director at the watchdog group Campaign for Accountability.

Brownstein Hyatt “has a lot of pull, and when it asks Interior to jump, Interior jumps,” Daniels said. “Does every other small firm applying for a mining permit run to the top lobbying firm in the country to work on their behalf? Seems a little disproportionate here.”

RMR defended its corporate track record and its project, but the company and its executives did not respond to detailed questions about its lobbying efforts and ties to Bernhardt. Jon Hrobsky, one of the Brownstein lobbyists working on behalf of RMR, has known Bernhardt since they were both staffers for former Republican Colorado Rep. Scott McInnis and worked with him at Interior during the George W. Bush administration. Hrobsky and another Brownstein lobbyist, Luke Johnson, have both met with Interior officials to discuss ""natural resources"" on behalf of the company, according to the disclosure forms.

The Brownstein firm registered as lobbying for RMR as of April 30, according to its disclosure form. But two of its employees, Michael Stratton and Christine Jochim, have been assisting RMR since at least February, according to emails POLITICO received via public information requests. On April 5, Stratton sent a message to Glenwood Springs City Manager Debra Figueroa saying he was “hoping to make progress on behalf of RMR relative to making a presentation about their quarry proposal,” according to one of the emails.

Stratton and Jochim provided legal work for RMR but did not lobby before April 30, a Brownstein spokesperson said.



When asked if Bernhardt had recused himself from the matter, an Interior spokesperson referred to his ethics pledge.

Bernhardt also has personal ties to the area: He grew up in Rifle, Colo., about a half-an-hour drive from Glenwood Springs.

The mine has been in operation since 1982. Glenwood Springs residents who have spoken up at county board meetings overwhelmingly opposed the expansion and said the noise, traffic and sheer size of the project would all but destroy their tourism-based economy.

Garfield County inspectors earlier this year found a range of violations at the mine: It has spread outside its currently permitted acreage, is selling products it wasn’t permitted to and is operating during months it had promised the county it would shut down, the inspectors wrote in a report.

In interviews, residents said the BLM’s office has refused to respond to their complaints, forcing them to turn to the agency’s D.C. headquarters. But the bureau has allowed the mine to keep operating despite its violations.

“We issued a letter [to BLM] saying we don’t think RMR is compliance,” Peterson said. “We’ve heard absolutely nothing from the BLM. It’s been crickets on that front.”

RMR, a holding company based in Beverly Hills, Calif., acquired the Mid-Continent mine in October 2016. CEO Chad Brownstein's father is Norm Brownstein, who founded and still chairs Brownstein Hyatt, where Bernhardt spent most of his professional life.

The fight between the company and the community reached a new level of antipathy in May, when RMR sued the county board and its members. The lawsuit contends that the county agreement the board is trying to enforce should take a back seat to the company’s permit from BLM.

Records indicate that board members have reached out to Bernhardt directly: They called him on Sept. 17 and met with him in his D.C. office on March 5, according to Bernhardt’s official schedules. Neither of those conversations involved the Mid-Continent mine issue, according to an Interior spokesperson and others who attended the meeting, although an initial meeting request form said the commissioners had asked to speak to Bernhardt about topics including BLM.

The board members are unable to speak about the matter, a county spokesperson said after POLITICO tried to ask them questions about the mining permit. But a month after meeting with Bernhardt, the board heard county inspectors list the mine’s violations and gave Rocky Mountain Resources until June 1 to comply.

Bernhardt has already come under fire for making policy decisions that could benefit Brownstein clients. Interior’s inspector general is reviewing Bernhardt’s role in blocking a department report analyzing how a controversial pesticide affected federally protected wildlife, and examining whether he improperly pushed to remove a species of small fish from the endangered species list to benefit a former client.

The House Committee On Oversight and Reform and the National Archives and Records Administration are also probing whether Bernhardt is suppressing the release of his meeting schedules.

Craig Holman, a lobbyist at the government watchdog group Public Citizen, said Bernhardt should allay these concerns by continuing to recuse himself from matters involving his former firm even after his ethics pledge ends in two months.

“Unfortunately, as we have seen over and over again with Bernhardt, the conflicts of interest are so widespread that they keep popping up and Bernhardt seems unable to divorce himself effectively from his former clients and employers,” Holman said.

The Brownstein firm has been actively working on the ground in Colorado to promote the project. Stratton, one of the Brownstein lobbyists, has advised Chad Brownstein on the mine since RMR acquired it in 2016, an RMR spokesperson said. He attended at least one Monday night county board hearing and has met with city officials seeking to persuade them that expanding the mine is in the community’s interests, according to interviews and documents obtained by POLITICO.



“Mike Stratton has advised Chad Brownstein for over two decades on corporate matters,” the spokesperson said. “Mike and Chad have equal to that a close personal friendship since Chad was 21.”

He has also participated in meetings and conference calls in which BLM discussed the limestone mine with RMR, said David Boyd, a spokesperson for the bureaus Northwest Colorado District. Boyd said he was “not aware” whether Chad Brownstein was involved in any of the discussions.

Stratton also represents the American Petroleum Association, the country's largest petroleum trade association.



The other Brownstein lawyer, Jochim, has worked on the mine proposal since at least February, according to emails POLITICO obtained. Jochim, a former Nuclear Regulatory Commission attorney and former Justice Department law clerk, requested in April that the city hand over all communications pertaining to the mine, according to documents POLITICO obtained through Colorado public record access laws.

Stratton declined to answer questions, saying he was not the company spokesperson. Jochim did not respond to questions.





A Rocky Mountain Resources spokesperson did not answer questions about whether Chad Brownstein or anyone in his father’s lobbying firm has discussed the project with either Bernhardt or other senior Interior staff. Company executives declined requests for an interview.

Residents and city officials said they don’t recall having any complaints about the mine before RMR bought it. The site has become the focus of numerous complaints since the new owner took over, however.



The mine’s operations have crept well outside the 16 acres originally stipulated in its county agreement and BLM permit, according to a March memo by Garfield County inspectors. Inspectors also found that RMR had not been paying royalties to the bureau for all the materials it had been extracting and selling from the mine.

Residents also complained that RMR was operating the mine year-round, violating its agreement with the county to shut operations every December to April to minimize harm to wildlife.

David McConaughy, a Glenwood Springs attorney representing the company, told the county board at its April public meeting that BLM has approved RMR’s requests for exemptions to the seasonal shutdowns since 2016. But neither BLM nor the company alerted the county at the time, board members responded.

""We’re trying to be transparent with the county ... to reconcile conflicts in the various permits,” McConaughy said at the hearing.

McConaughy declined to speak to POLITICO, referring questions to RMR.

BLM returned Rocky Mountain Resources’ March expansion proposal to the company within the required 30-day review period, saying the plan didn’t contain enough information. The local BLM office is “currently determining how to address the existing mining operations as well as any future proposal,” the bureau’s Boyd said.

“As would typically be the case for controversial topics in a field office, the BLM Washington Office and DOI have been briefed on the potential expansion proposal for the Mid-Continent Quarry,” Boyd added.

A Rocky Mountain Resources spokesperson defended the company’s record, saying the violations of the county agreement stemmed from problems inherited from the previous owner. The company also said the expansion would diversify the economy of a town that depends on tourists arriving to hike and ski the nearby mountains.

“Currently, many Glenwood Springs’ employers are unable or unwilling to provide their employees adequate wages to afford the town’s high cost of living, including affordable housing for teachers and developing professionals,” the company said in a statement to POLITICO. “RMR believes a community should embrace opportunities to improve the lives of its constituents, not just those who can afford to influence local politics.”

Residents who spoke to POLITICO said RMR’s economic arguments ring hollow.

Besides expanding the mining pit area, RMR also proposed increasing truck traffic from around 20 round trips a day to as many as 450, according to a proposal it submitted to the BLM in March. The dramatic increase in traffic — plus the sight of the expanded mine in the hills above the town — would all but cripple Glenwood Springs’ tourist economy, said former Mayor Michael Gamba, a Republican civil engineer.

“We had lived harmoniously with that mine for the past 20-plus years,” Gamba said in an interview. “Had nothing changed, we would have had no objections to them having it. But the proposed expansion is an existential threat to our community.”"

Homeland Security watchdog retires early after his office was forced to retract ‘feel-good’ audits of disaster response,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Lisa Rein', 'Reporter Covering Federal Agencies', 'The Management Of Government In The Trump Administration', 'Kimberly Kindy', 'National Investigative Reporter']",06-10-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/homeland-security-watchdog-retires-early-after-his-office-was-forced-to-retract-feel-good-audits-of-disaster-response/2019/06/10/a370f488-8b9d-11e9-b08e-cfd89bd36d4e_story.html,"A house on Staten Island that was heavily damaged during Hurricane Sandy, shown in 2012. (Paul J. Richards/AFP/Getty Images)

John V. Kelly, the acting inspector general for the Department of Homeland Security, announced his retirement Monday following revelations that he directed his staff to whitewash audits of the agency’s performance after federal disasters.

Kelly, 64, a career auditor who rose to the top job in 2017, announced his retirement in a brief email Monday morning to hundreds of DHS employees and contractors.

“It has been an honor and privilege to serve the American citizens for over 40 years,” he wrote. “However, it is time for me to retire.”

Kelly, who had planned to retire after the confirmation of President Trump’s nominee for the position, wrote in an email to The Washington Post that he “accelerated my retirement because I feel it’s in the best interest of the organization and its employees.”

“As I told the staff, I have truly enjoyed my 11-year tenure with the DHS OIG, an organization with a very important mission and extraordinary staff and managers that successfully execute that mission on a daily basis,” Kelly wrote. “Nobody in DHS leadership or any member of Congress asked me retire.”

Kelly’s announcement follows The Post’s report last week that an internal review found that Kelly overrode auditors who had found problems with the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s response to various disasters.

When teams of auditors flew to local communities to assess how well FEMA was helping residents recover, Kelly — then in charge of the emergency management auditing staff — directed them to ignore most problems, according to the internal review and interviews. Instead, he told them to produce what the staff dubbed “feel-good reports.”

[How the DHS watchdog whitewashed audits of FEMA’s disaster response]

The practice was repeated over five years after hurricanes, floods, wildfires and other disasters, including Hurricane Sandy in 2012 and catastrophic flooding in Louisiana in 2016, the review found.

Under pressure from House Republicans, the inspector general’s office retracted 13 faulty reports and purged them from its website in 2017 and 2018. Officials acknowledged they did not comply with federal auditing standards.

The inspector general’s office then spent 14 months examining what occurred. Kelly was recused from the review.

Investigators found that Kelly had praised FEMA’s work ethic to his auditors, telling them they would see “FEMA at her best” and instructing supervisors to emphasize what the agency had done right in its disaster response

Kelly joined the inspector general’s office in 2008 from the Government Accountability Office, where his long career covered performance and financial audits and program evaluations at numerous federal agencies.

A graduate of the University of Scranton, he quickly rose through the ranks in the DHS inspector general’s office, which provides independent, fact-driven audits and investigations of the performance of the sprawling agency.

The flawed audits on his watch represented a tiny fraction of the watchdog’s oversight of FEMA. The internal review did not find that Kelly was influenced by a personal relationship with anyone at the emergency response agency.

However, Jennifer Costello, the deputy inspector general, told the head of the internal review team that the “retraction of publicly issued reports because they are not reliable” was “not an insignificant matter.”

The reports, Costello wrote, “represent millions of wasted taxpayer dollars and understandably cast doubt on our credibility.” She said the inspector general’s office needs to hold itself to “the same standards to which we hold the Department when conducting oversight of its programs and operation.”

When the internal review was made public on May 23, Kelly sent his staff an email of apology, writing, “I take responsibility for failing to set a tone that all of our products need to be fully objective.”

The office has agreed to an outside review of its performance by another federal inspector general’s office to ensure that it has improved its overall operations and oversight of FEMA.

Trump this spring nominated Joseph V. Cuffari, a policy adviser to Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey (R), to lead the office. His nomination has not yet been voted on by the Senate.

Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), chairman of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, said that the situation underscored the need for Cuffari to be promptly confirmed. “Ensuring a department has an independent inspector general is vital to maintaining transparency and holding government agencies accountable,” Johnson said in a statement."
US Department of Defense Reports Final Results from Travelan® Shigellosis Challenge Study,https://finance.yahoo.com,[],06-12-2019,2019,6,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-department-defense-reports-final-110000151.html,"Key Highlights:



Travelan ® shigellosis challenge studies in non-human primates successfully completed

Travelan ® prevented clinical shigellosis (bacillary dysentery) in 75% of Travelan ® treated animals compared to placebo and demonstrated a significant clinical benefit

Prophylactic administration of Travelan ® may provide an effective prevention alternative to antibiotics for gastrointestinal infections in humans

Three new Shigella specific anti-microbial therapeutics under preclinical evaluation

A preventative treatment that protects against enteric diseases, specifically Shigella, is a high priority objective for the US Army

MELBOURNE, Australia, June 12, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Immuron Limited (ASX: IMC; NASDQ: IMRN), an Australian biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing oral immunotherapeutics for the prevention and treatment of many gut mediated pathogens, today is pleased to provide shareholders with an update on the company’s cooperative research and development agreements with the US Department of Defense (US DoD).

The Shigella challenge model was used to assess the therapeutic potential of Travelan® as a prevention treatment for shigellosis or dysentery. The placebo-controlled study was carried out in 12 juvenile rhesus monkeys segregated into 2 groups: a Travelan® treatment cohort of 8 and a placebo cohort of 4, which were treated twice daily for a total of 12 doses over a 6-day period. The animals received treatment for 3-days prior to oral challenge with ~3 x 109 viable Shigella organisms.

As reported in September last year, all (4 of 4 - 100%) placebo-treated animals displayed acute clinical signs of dysentery within 24 – 36 hours of Shigella challenge. Only two of the eight Travelan-treated group displayed any signs of dysentery. The remaining 6 of 8 (75%) of the Travelan-treated group remained healthy and without signs of dysentery post challenge. Recently completed histopathological analysis, which provides a comprehensive view of the clinical disease and its effect on tissues of gut, revealed that all animals in the placebo-treated group displayed severe inflammation in different parts of the gastrointestinal tract. These animals also had very high levels of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1b, IL-6 and IL-8) in fecal samples collected throughout the study. The inflammation seen in the gastrointestinal tract and the increase in inflammatory cytokines in the feces were closely associated with the observed clinical outcomes of dysentery. Only 3 of the 8 Travelan-treated animals had signs of inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract, and only 2 of those had high levels of inflammatory cytokines in fecal samples. All other animals in the Travelan-treated group were clinically healthy and did not excrete any inflammatory cytokines. Overall the results suggest that Travelan® is functionally cross-reactive and may have some prophylactic activity against Shigellosis.

“The latest results reported by our colleagues at the US Armed Forces Research Institute of Medical Sciences (AFRIMS), an overseas laboratory of the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR), located in Bangkok, Thailand are very impressive indeed. The study results clearly demonstrated that animals with severe inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract and high inflammatory cytokines in fecal samples were associated with severe dysentery and that prophylactic administration of Travelan® significantly reduced the inflammatory response,” said Dr. Robert Kaminski, Chief, Subunit Enteric Vaccines and Immunology, Department of Enteric Infections, Bacterial Diseases Branch, WRAIR.

The abstract of the study findings has been submitted for presentation at the 10th International conference on Vaccines for Enteric Diseases which will be held at the University of Lausanne Switzerland on the 16th to 18th October 2019.

“This is further validation of our technology platform,” said Dr. Gary Jacob, CEO of Immuron. “The work completed by our research collaborators at the WRAIR has clearly demonstrated the effectiveness of Travelan® and the Immuron technology platform in neutralizing pathogenic gastrointestinal bacterial infections and offers significant potential as a preventative treatment for US military personnel and civilians stationed or traveling in locations where such infections may be debilitating.”

The company is also pleased to report that it has completed the manufacture of three new Shigella specific therapeutic products which have been manufactured with proprietary vaccines developed by the WRAIR. Preliminary laboratory evaluation has indicated that all three products have generated a strong antibody response to the Shigella antigens used in the manufacturing campaign. The three products will be evaluated in preclinical models of shigellosis developed by the WRAIR.

“The WRAIR has been developing vaccines against Shigella for over a decade and the combination of our Shigella vaccine research and development efforts with Immuron’s oral immunotherapy platform make perfect sense. The WRAIR will fund the evaluation of the anti-Shigella specific activity of the new products including assessing their protective capacity in established small animal models which will be completed and reported throughout the remainder of this year,” said Dr. Robert Kaminski.

House Intelligence panel requests documents after reports WH blocked climate change testimony,https://www.cnn.com,['Eli Watkins'],06-11-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/11/politics/house-intelligence-state-department-climate-change/index.html,"Washington (CNN) House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff has requested documents from a State Department agency on the heels of reports that the White House blocked an official from submitting testimony on climate change.

Schiff, a California Democrat, said in a letter dated Tuesday to Ellen McCarthy, the assistant secretary for the State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research, that his committee was left with ""deep concern"" that the Trump administration recently sought to bar the submission of written testimony from Rod Schoonover ""for political reasons."" Schoonover, an analyst with the State Department agency, testified before the House panel last week.

The Washington Post, citing several administration sources, reported that officials from several different White House offices took issue with Schoonover's prepared testimony in which he was going to warn Congress about wide-ranging and ""possibly catastrophic"" national security concerns as a result of human-caused climate change.

In his letter, Schiff said the administration ""repeatedly confirmed"" ahead of the June 5 hearing that Schoonover would submit written testimony, but that the evening before the hearing, the State Department informed the committee ""without explanation"" that the agency would not submit a written statement.

He said the House Intelligence Committee, ""in light of these reports of undue White House interference in testimony before the Committee,"" now requests testimony from McCarthy or ""an appropriate senior representative"" to address: Schoonover's testimony; communications with the White House about that written testimony; the prepared written testimony itself; and other documents relevant to the hearing and blocked testimony.

Republicans assail Dean’s record: 'How many presidents have you accused of being Richard Nixon?',https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],06-10-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/congress/republicans-shred-deans-record-how-many-presidents-have-you-accused-of-being-richard-nixon,"Republican lawmakers on the House Judiciary Committee Monday attacked star witness John Dean’s credibility, citing his criminal record and history of attacking President Trump and other Republicans.

“Mr. Dean has made a cottage industry out of accusing presidents of acting like Richard Nixon,” Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., said.

Dean, the ex-White House counsel in President Richard Nixon's administration, was convicted of obstruction of justice after striking a deal to cooperate with the Watergate investigation. He has spent decades critical of the GOP and wrote a book in 2004 accusing President George H.W. Bush of acts “worse than Watergate.”

He frequently appears on CNN as a paid contributor, in which he's usually criticizing Trump.

Democrats invited him to serve as their lead witness in a hearing meant to scrutinize the special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into alleged Russian collusion with the 2016 Trump campaign.

But Republicans ridiculed his appearance.

“You are functionally here as a prop because they can’t impeach the president,” Gaetz said, referring to the public polling against impeachment and resistance from Speaker Nancy Pelosi to allow an impeachment inquiry.

Dean declined to tell Gaetz how much money he has earned through his GOP criticisms in books and on television. Dean said he didn’t know.

“It’s not by choice I’ve done a lot of this,” Dean said. “I’ve been dragged into this.”

House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., and other Democrats praised Dean as a key figure in helping the Watergate prosecutors and whose testimony was deemed truthful.

And Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., recalled his father, left-wing social critic Marcus Raskin, being placed on Nixon’s enemies list. Rep. Raskin on Monday called Dean “a man of honor, a man of integrity, and a man who stands up to the truth.”

But Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., pointed out 19 discrepancies were discovered in Dean’s statements back during the Watergate investigation.

Democrats called on Dean to use his Watergate past to assess Trump’s actions to obstruct the Mueller investigation.

Nadler introduced Dean without mentioning either his criminal conviction or that his law license was revoked.

“He is most well known as a principal witness during the Senate Watergate hearing,” Nadler said. “Where his testimony was later fully corroborated as to its truthfulness by the revelations in President Nixon’s White House tapes.”

Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, read through a litany of negative comments Dean has made about Trump, including one in which he describes discussing Trump’s impeachment with Pelosi, D-Calif.

Biggs called Dean a convicted felon offering “conjecture and legal posturing,” offering dubious testimony.

“You are not the fall guy in the Watergate scandal,” Biggs told Dean. “The FBI referred to you as the master manipulator of the cover-up. The U.S. attorney’s office said you were at the center of the criminality.”

Biggs called the hearing a farce.

“So much of what you say seems very difficult to accept at face value quite frankly,” Biggs said."

Veteran 'literally body-slammed' by VA police: Lawmakers grill VA on use of force,https://www.usatoday.com,"['Donovan Slack', 'Published P.M. Et June']",06-11-2019,2019,6,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/06/11/veterans-affairs-officials-grilled-va-police-vet-injuries-death/1425552001/,"CLOSE A USA TODAY investigation into VA Medical Centers shows that veterans are enduring longer emergency room wait times than those at non-VA facilities. USA TODAY

WASHINGTON – One described a Veterans Affairs police officer throwing a New York veteran seeking therapy to the ground. Another said a California veteran died after receiving similar treatment at the hands of VA police there. A third noted that a VA officer training to be an instructor at the national VA police academy threatened employees with a gun at a Massachusetts car dealership.

The underlying question from lawmakers to VA officials Tuesday: What is going on with VA police?

“I mean really what are they doing over there?” asked Rep. Gilbert Cisneros, Jr, D-Calif., who questioned training in particular. “Why are we having these situations where individuals are being injured or hurt or killed?”

An investigation of the VA police force by the agency’s inspector general concluded in December that systemic management failures had resulted in short-staffing and millions in overtime charged to taxpayers, as well as missed opportunities to ensure staff and veteran patients were protected.

USA TODAY reported in December on a case in Missouri where a veteran died after being tackled and detained by VA police in Kansas City.

Senior VA executives told lawmakers at the hearing Tuesday that the agency has hired a new security manager and appointed police supervisors in every VA region to improve management. They said officer training has been extended in recent years and includes a focus on de-escalating situations rather than confrontation.

“It’s really troubling, it’s hard for me to sit here and answer questions after hearing the stories that you’re talking about, and certainly anytime anything like this occurs, we have to go back and question whether or not the things that we are doing are being effective,” said Renee Oshinski, acting deputy under secretary for health for operations and management.

Kevin Hanretta, the principal deputy assistant secretary for operations, security and preparedness, said the incidents in New York and California described by lawmakers are “very unfortunate.” But he said they are not representative of “the VA police in the field serving our nation’s veterans.” Hanretta said the job offer for the instructor-trainee at the academy, since rescinded, is under investigation.

The VA employs nearly 4,000 officers at 139 medical centers who play a critical role in securing property, preventing and investigating crimes and often intervening to help patients or staff during potentially dangerous incidents.

'Literally body-slammed'

Rep. Kathleen Rice, D-N.Y., said Tuesday that mission went awry when one of her constituents went last June to the VA in Northport, N.Y. Jean Telefort, a veteran with post-traumatic stress disorder, was seeking therapy after spinal surgery.

She said the VA had allowed him to see a non-VA therapist after the procedure, but then cut that off and sent him to a VA facility instead. That facility, however, didn’t offer therapy. So the VA sent him to the VA in Northport. When he became frustrated, a scheduling clerk there called VA police.

“He was literally body slammed onto the ground, with his arms twisted behind his back,” Rice said. “This is someone who was post spinal surgery – he informed them of that, ‘I can’t breathe, I just had spinal surgery.’”

But VA officers kept him on the ground, and refused to take his handcuffs off, even after a physical therapist who had treated him before said Telefort was not a danger.

Rice said he later received summonses to appear in federal court for charges that have since been deferred. She said a VA employee later accessed his medical records and entered false information.

“This incident keeps going on and on and on,” Rice said. “The questions that I have are many.”

The director of the VA’s office of security and law enforcement, Frederick Jackson, said an investigation after the incident, which included statements from witnesses, concluded the VA officers acted appropriately.

Veterans die after VA police run-ins

In Loma Linda, California, a 65-year-old veteran became frustrated after waiting four hours for a procedure in 2011. He tried to leave and go to a VA in Long Beach instead, but VA officers wouldn’t let him.

“They pretty much took him, slammed him to the ground, hit his head and he ended up dying,” Cisneros said.

The family won a $500,000 settlement from the VA in 2015, according to the lawyer who filed the case, although the agency maintained he had died from an unrelated stroke.

Family members of the veteran who died in Kansas City after an altercation with VA police also have filed suit. USA TODAY reported in December that a veteran tackled by VA officers outside the VA medical center was found by emergency medical workers to be “non-verbal, moaning with a decreased level of consciousness,” according to internal documents.

They said he had a gash in his scalp and “multiple” cuts and bruises on his face. A CT scan of his head showed areas of bleeding around his brain. The veteran, identified as Dale Farhner in the lawsuit, died soon afterward.

In response to inquiries from USA TODAY at the time, VA spokesman Curt Cashour said the incident was under investigation.

An instructor trainee

In January, a VA police employee who had recently won a post as an instructor trainee at the national VA police academy stumbled into a car dealership in Massachusetts, flashed a gun and demanded gas for his car, The Boston Globe reported.

Police arrested him and put him in a cell, where he stuffed the toilet with paper and banged his head against the door. He had previously been dismissed from the Massachusetts State Police, faced allegations of sexual harassment and, in 2017, had his permit to carry a weapon revoked.

“Can you just help me understand how that would happen – how this man of all people would be sent to the elite VA police academy?” Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass., asked VA officials Tuesday.

Hanretta, the deputy assistant secretary overseeing security, said the VA immediately launched an investigation and the academy job offer was rescinded.

“In this particular case, at the time of his selection, we were not aware of all of the background circumstances,” he said.

Jackson, the director of law enforcement noted that while he did “go down to the law enforcement training center, he was never an instructor” because he hadn’t completed training yet.

“I have no idea why this man would wear the uniform period,” Moulton said.

“We will work with this group of employees just as we work with all USDA employees,” Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said in a statement Tuesday. (Erik S. Lesser/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock) (Erik S Lesser/EPA-EFE/REX/Shutterstock)

For the second time this year, workers at a science division of the Agriculture Department voted overwhelmingly to unionize in apparent revolt against the administration’s plan to relocate them from Washington, D.C., to a yet-to-be-announced location.

On Tuesday, employees at the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, which distributes $400 million in competitive grants to researchers around the country each year, voted 137 to 2 to be represented by the American Federation of Government Employees, the largest federal employees union. In May, the Economic Research Service, a federal statistical agency also included in the relocation, voted 138 to 4 to unionize with AFGE.

“We will work with this group of employees just as we work with all USDA employees,” Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said in a statement distributed to reporters before the votes were counted. In August, Perdue announced the relocation as a cost-saving measure that would move scientists closer to those they serve, a claim critics dispute.

In early May, USDA announced that Kansas City, the Research Triangle in North Carolina and the state of Indiana had been selected as the leading candidates for relocation sites. The department has not said when it would make a final decision. “I truly believe that the relocation of ERS and NIFA will help to fulfill USDA’s commitment to be the most effective, most efficient and most customer-focused agency in the federal government,” Perdue said in the statement.

But former USDA officials and leaders in the agricultural community argue the relocation will paralyze the agencies, and have also warned that this proposal is an attempt to weaken the influence of scientists under the Trump administration.

Members of Congress were divided largely along partisan lines. At an Agriculture Committee hearing last week, Rep. Neal Dunn (R-Fla.) said the secretary “has broad support to move forward with this decision.” But Democrats in both chambers have introduced legislation to block the move, and they dispute whether the secretary has the authority to relocate the offices without congressional approval.

Peter Winch, a union organizer for AFGE, said that the newly formed union would ask the department to allow employees to visit the proposed relocation site and to give them more than 30 days to respond to reassignment letters.

The unionization vote comes as the Trump administration has taken a confrontational approach toward federal employees and their unions with executive orders, new policies creating a faster path to firing and tough stances at the bargaining table.

At a rally on Tuesday morning, about a dozen NIFA and ERS employees waved American flags and handed out pro-union stickers. Unionization would “delay changes to working conditions” and offer “protection from political interference,” according to the fliers they distributed. Those who spoke to The Washington Post did so on the condition of anonymity because they said they feared professional repercussions. Many employees are applying for new jobs in the District, and few said that they would consider relocating.

A senior NIFA employee said that the push to unionize “would never have happened without the secretary of agriculture.” Another lamented the absence of a USDA chief scientist, who in previous administrations had been the voice of scientists in the department.

A third employee said the workload — the number of grant awards to be processed — has quadrupled due to high attrition and the lasting effects of the federal government shutdown this winter. NIFA’s $1.7 billion budget supports cutting-edge research as well as rural communities and programs like 4-H. “The mission still has to be done,” the person said, but the “morale is not great.”

Inside the NIFA office building, workers waited for up to an hour to vote. Three-quarters of NIFA employees eligible to cast a ballot did so. About 30 people watched as an official from the Federal Labor Relations Authority counted the votes. NIFA employees cheered when the final tally was announced.

“Waiting for the department to give us a voice was not going to happen,” the senior NIFA employee said. The relocation process, which has “generated considerable frustration,” the person said, “provided a lot of motivation for employees to form a union in order to have a voice.”

The administration has argued that its pro-management policies are an effort to make government and its employees more efficient and able to serve the public. But the actions have created anxiety in federal offices and resulted in court challenges.

Last year, a federal judge shot down the bulk of three White House executive orders that were designed to bring a pro-management atmosphere to federal offices.

Among the toughest provisions was a drastic cut to what is known as official time, legally mandated spans that union officials spend on the clock representing their members in grievances and other disputes. The executive orders also sought to make it easier for managers to fire poor performers.

The judge’s ruling is on appeal, and a decision is expected in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, the administration has worked around the constraints of the court ruling at the bargaining table.

State Dept. pushes back on Friedman comments about Israel's 'right' to annex West Bank,https://www.cnn.com,"['Nicole Gaouette', 'Jennifer Hansler']",06-11-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/11/politics/david-friedman-us-israel-west-bank/index.html,"Washington (CNN) The State Department pushed back on comments by the US ambassador to Israel suggesting that Israel has a right to annex part of the West Bank.

State Department spokesperson Morgan Ortagus said the administration's position on the West Bank has not changed, despite Ambassador David Friedman's comments to The New York Times that ""Israel has the right to retain some, but unlikely all, of the West Bank.""

Speaking to reporters Monday, Ortagus said that ""the administration's position on the settlements has not changed. Our policy on the West Bank has not changed.""

Asked what the US position on settlement activity is, a State Department official cited President Donald Trump, saying that ""as the President has said, while the existence of settlements is not in itself an impediment to peace, further unrestrained settlement activity doesn't help advance peace.""

International law

Israeli settlement activity in the Palestinian territories is illegal under international law, though Israel has always sought to dispute this. The State Department official said they had nothing further to add when asked if the US considers Israeli settlement construction to be illegal.

Ortagus on Monday said there was no plan for any sort of disciplinary action against Friedman.

""The ambassador, the secretary and everyone who is involved in the Middle East peace plan, in this entire administration, is working towards a comprehensive and lasting peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians,"" she continued.

The State Department has been a junior partner in the administration's efforts to forge a resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. That initiative has been led out of the White House by Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, along with Friedman and a former lawyer for the Trump organization, Jason Greenblatt.

'A significant change'

The trio has been promoting the economic aspects of their plan, saying they want to improve Palestinian quality of life, but downplaying the prospect of finding a political solution and playing down the long-standing formula of a two-state solution with both sides having a capital in Jerusalem.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu raised the prospect of annexing some parts of the West Bank in the final days of the recent election campaign in an effort to rally conservative voters. Asked if that move might hurt the chances of peace, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told Jake Tapper in April, ""I think that the vision that we'll lay out is going to represent a significant change from the model that's been used.""

Aaron David Miller, a vice president at the Wilson Center and a CNN contributor, said that in previous administrations, Israeli settlement policy was ""on the radar screen"" as an issue.

Not on the radar

""It is now not on the radar screen and there is what I would describe as a willful acquiescence to the settlement enterprise,"" Miller said. ""When no one challenges statements about annexation, including the secretary of state ... you can't help reach the conclusion that this is a fundamental reorientation in policy to basically undermine the traditional US approach"" of a two-state solution and ""some reconciliation between Israelis and Palestinians.""

Other analysts raised the security implications of annexation.

The Israeli Policy Forum, a group that advocates for a two-state solution, said while Friedman's annexation remarks ""are not surprising, given his long publicized pro-settlement and anti-two-state outlook, they are disturbing nonetheless."" The Israeli security establishment, most major American Jewish organizations and pro-Israel members of Congress support the idea of two states, the forum said.

Annexation would be ""deeply harmful to Israel's long-term future as a Jewish, democratic, and secure state,"" the forum said in a statement, adding that it would create an uncertain security and diplomatic environment for Israel, risk the collapse of the Palestinian Authority and ""be a disaster for Israelis and Palestinians."""

The European Sessile Oak originated from the site in France where more than 9,000 U.S. Marines died in battle during World War I. It was planted on the South Lawn of the White House on April 23, 2018 during Macron's state visit, but mysteriously disappeared five days later.

A tweet by French ambassador to the U.S. Gérard Araud on April 29 indicated that the tree was not missing, but was quarantined. The mandatory quarantine is for any living organism imported to the U.S. The tree was to be replanted later.

The tree was never replanted and died in quarantine, a diplomatic source told Agence France-Presse.

Since the planting of the ""friendship tree"" the two leaders' relationship has grown rocky over issues including, what to do in Iran, addressing climate change and world trade."
Ethics group goes after Interior for sidestepping Senate when filling posts,https://thehill.com,[],06-12-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/448141-ethics-group-goes-after-interior-for-sidestepping-senate-when,"An environmental group filed a complaint against the Department of the Interior on Tuesday, saying the agency shuffled controversial employees into roles without Senate confirmation.

A May 23 order from Interior Secretary David Bernhardt slotted people into various vacant roles that would normally require a nomination to the Senate.

Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility (PEER) argued the agency is violating federal law on vacancies by “temporarily redelegating” roles to existing employees for the 27th time under the Trump administration.

PEER said some of those who took over positions that require confirmation by the Senate would be unlikely to get confirmed if officially nominated. ADVERTISEMENT

The group is especially focused on Karen Budd-Falen, who had sued Interior and the Bureau of Land Management numerous times as a lawyer in Wyoming.

PEER senior counsel Peter Jenkins said Budd-Falen is too controversial for approval by the Senate.

“Putting Karen Budd-Falen in this position is like putting Genghis Khan in charge of a day care center,” he said in a statement. “Since David Bernhardt knows Budd-Falen is so right wing that she could never be confirmed for the job he just gave her, this maneuver only underlines the Administration’s continuing contempt for the Senate’s constitutional advice and consent prerogative.”

Interior did not respond to a request for comment.

Budd-Falen was serving as deputy solicitor at Interior, a role that does not require Senate review. Bernhardt appointed her to the role of assistant secretary for Fish and Wildlife and Parks. Robert Wallace was recently nominated to take over that post — a role that has gone without a Senate-confirmed leader since 2011.

Wallace looks headed for likely confirmation given his support from Republicans, Democrats and some in the conservation community, but it’s not clear when the Senate may vote to confirm him.

PEER said the lack of Senate-confirmed leadership at Interior across multiple departments invalidates some agency decisions regarding Sage Grouse management. Their complaint asks the inspector general's office to remedy the issue by forcing Interior to reissue some decisions that were made by offices without an official leader."
DOJ investigating 'non-governmental organizations and individuals' as part of 'broad' probe into surveillance abuses,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/durham-investigating-non-governmental-organizations-and-individuals-potentially-including-fusion-gps,"As part of its ongoing ""multifaceted"" and ""broad"" review into potential misconduct by U.S. intelligence agencies during the 2016 presidential campaign, the Justice Department revealed Monday it is also investigating the activities of several ""non-governmental organizations and individuals.""

Additionally, the DOJ announced that the probe, let by Connecticut U.S. Attorney John Durham, was looking into the involvement of ""foreign intelligence services."" Former Trump aide George Papadopoulos told Fox News last month that an informant who was likely ""CIA and affiliated with Turkish intel"" had posed as a Cambridge University research assistant in September 2016 and tried to ""seduce him"" to obtain information linking the Trump team to Russia.

The information was contained in a letter to House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., who had inquired as to the scope of Durham's investigation. The letter could indicate that the DOJ is looking closely at work done during the campaign by Fusion GPS, the firm retained by the Hillary Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee (DNC) to conduct opposition research against the Trump campaign.

Fusion GPS, in turn, hired British ex-spy Christopher Steele to produce an unverified and largely discredited dossier that the FBI went on to cite in secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) court applications to surveil former Trump aide Carter Page.

CARTER PAGE: FBI INFORMANT 'INTENSIFIED' COMMUNICATIONS JUST BEFORE FISA WARRANT OBTAINED

Last week, reports indicated Steele had agreed to talk with Durham if certain preconditions were met. Multiple sources familiar with the matter told Fox News, meanwhile, that Durham is “very dialed in” and “asking all the right questions."" Separately, sources within the Justice Department confirmed to Fox News that Barr has met “on multiple occasions in recent weeks” with Durham in Washington, D.C.

Numerous problems with the Steele dossier's reliability have surfaced, including several issues that were brought to the FBI's attention before it cited the dossier in its FISA application and subsequent renewals. Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report made plain, for example, that then-Trump lawyer Michael Cohen did not travel to Prague to conspire with Russian hackers seeking to access Democrat files, as the dossier alleged.

Mueller also was unable to substantiate the dossier's claims that Page had received a large payment relating to the sale of a share of Rosneft, a Russian oil giant.

FMR TRUMP AIDE ALLEGES BOMBSHELL INFORMANT TRIED TO 'SEDUCE' HIM IN 'BIZARRE' EPISODE FOR RUSSIA DIRT ON TRUMP

North Carolina GOP Rep. Mark Meadows told Fox News on Sunday he has seen ""additional documents"" that demonstrate that “prior to the first FISA application, Peter Strzok, Andy McCabe, and others at the FBI knew that Christopher Steele's dossier was not credible.” Internal FBI text messages obtained by Fox News in March showed FBI brass scrambling to respond to a concern from a senior DOJ official about the potential ""bias"" of a key FISA source.

Meadows, speaking to ""Fox News Sunday,"" pointed specifically to a report from The Hill's John Solomon, who found that Ukrainian businessman Konstantin Kilimnik, a key figure in Mueller's report, was actually a U.S. informant. In his report, Mueller linked Kilimnik to Russian intelligence, and did not mention Kilimnik's secretive ties to the U.S. in the report other court filings -- even as Mueller suggested former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort's ties to Kilimnik were nefarious.

""The deeper the dive we take into the Mueller report, we're starting to find out some of the conclusions, and actually some of the facts they put forth in there, are a misrepresentation of what we actually know,"" Meadows said.

Meadows added that he expected DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz's investigation into potential FBI and DOJ surveillance misconduct to come out later than June, when it was originally expected. Meadows said more information has come to light that might necessitate the delay.

Solomon, reporting for the Hill, also recently unearthed a documented conversation Steele had with a State Department contact -- which were relayed to the FBI -- in which Steele claimed the Russians were running a “technical/human operation run out of Moscow targeting the election"" and that ""payments to those recruited are made out of the Russian Consulate in Miami.""

There is no Russian consulate in Miami, a fact the State Department official, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Kathleen Kavalec, emphasized in her notes. Additionally, Steele had suggested his client was ""keen"" to see his information come to light prior to Election Day. Kavalec forwarded her notes to the FBI and other government officials several days before the FISA warrant was issued for Page. Fox News has confirmed The Hill's reporting.

RUSSIAN-BORN UK ACADEMIC SAYS SHE'S BEING USED TO 'SMEAR' MICHAEL FLYNN

Further, in its original FISA application and subequent renewals, the FBI told the FISA court that it ""did not believe"" Steele was the direct source for a Yahoo News article implicating Page in Russian collusion. Instead, the FBI suggested to the court, the September 2016 article by Michael Isikoff was independent corroboration of the dossier.

But London court records show that contrary to the FBI's assessments, Steele briefed Yahoo News and other reporters in the fall of 2016 at the direction of Fusion GPS.

Carter Page has not been charged with any wrongdoing, even though the FBI called him an ""agent of a foreign power"" in its October 2016 FISA application. On Sunday, Page told Fox News' ""Sunday Morning Futures"" that his actions had been ""completely spun in the fake Mueller"" report to help advance what he characterized as Democrats' ""ridiculous"" goal of impeachment.

In an internal memo sent to Pentagon staff and members of the armed forces, Shanahan said long-standing Pentagon policy allows military professionals to carry out ""obligations of citizenship,"" including ""certain political activities."" He stressed, however, that there are limitations in place to ensure their actions don't appear partisan.

""Our policy and tradition also clearly limit active duty members from engaging in partisan political activities or actions that could appear to imply DoD sponsorship, approval, or endorsement of a political candidate, campaign, or cause,"" Shanahan wrote in the memo, which was first reported by CNN.

""I expect you to remind leaders at all levels in the Department to reinforce the apolitical nature of military service and professionalism, while ensuring all Service members remain free to exercise the responsibilities of citizenship as laws and regulations allows,"" he added.

Shanahan's message comes after the administration faced bipartisan criticism over attempts by White House officials to keep the USS John S. McCain out of President Trump's view during his state visit to Japan last month. After the episode came to light, Shanahan said the Navy had ignored the directive and said he had asked the Pentagon's inspector general to review the incident.

During that same trip, U.S. service members attending a Memorial Day address by Mr. Trump were photographed wearing patches inspired by his campaign slogan, ""Make America Great Again."" When the photos first surfaced, the Pentagon told CBS News it was reviewing the incident.

Lawmakers try to save DHS lab that prepares first responders for terror threats,https://www.cnn.com,['Geneva Sands'],06-10-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/10/politics/dhs-lab-first-responders-funding-house/index.html,"(CNN) Lawmakers are again attempting to keep a Department of Homeland Security laboratory that specializes in first-responder technology and assistance from shutting its doors.

The House overwhelmingly passed a bill Monday evening that would permanently authorize the New York City-based National Urban Security Technology Laboratory, which has been at risk of losing funding over the past couple of years and was not included in the administration's latest DHS funding request.

The lab ""is constantly developing and testing new tools for our brave first responders to use in the event of a terrorist attack, industrial accident or natural disaster and closely collaborates with law enforcement agencies like the FDNY, NYPD and the Nassau County Police Department in my district,"" Rep. Kathleen Rice, a New York Democrat who cosponsored the bill, said Monday on the House floor, urging her colleagues to pass the legislation. The final vote was 395-3.

She said the administration has proposed closing the lab in each of the last two federal budgets.

The potential funding cut comes amid budget battles between the White House and Democrats on Capitol Hill, as the administration has shifted its funding and influence to the department's immigration missions.

U.S. refiner group sues Trump EPA over high-ethanol gasoline,https://www.reuters.com,"['Reuters Editorial', 'Min Read']",06-11-2019,2019,6,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-ethanol-lawsuit/u-s-refiner-group-sues-trump-epa-over-high-ethanol-gasoline-idUSKCN1TB2HP,"FILE PHOTO: The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) sign is seen on the podium at EPA headquarters in Washington, U.S., July 11, 2018. REUTERS/Ting Shen

(Reuters) - The main U.S. refining industry association said on Monday it sued to block the Trump administration’s effort to expand sales of higher ethanol blends of gasoline, arguing the move exceeded the administration’s authority.

The legal challenge from the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers (AFPM) association escalated a battle between the oil and corn industries over the nation’s biofuel policy, which requires refiners to blend biofuels like corn-based ethanol into their gasoline, often at great expense.

President Donald Trump had directed the Environmental Protection Agency to lift a summertime ban on the sale of gasoline containing 15 percent ethanol, called E15, in an effort to help farmers suffering from the U.S. trade war with China. The EPA unveiled its rule doing so on May 31.

The summertime E15 ban had been implemented during the Obama administration to reduce smog emissions, but Trump’s EPA said E15’s impact on air quality was similar to that of E10, which could already be sold year-round.

The tension over the policy move reflects how Trump has struggled to please both Big Oil and Big Agriculture, two critical constituencies in the Republican president’s 2020 re-election bid.

AFPM asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia to review the EPA’s rule, in papers filed on Monday, said Diana Cronan, a spokeswoman for the group.

AFPM has one month to provide the court with the outline of its case, she said."
USDA Set to Adjust U.S. Soy Numbers in July Report - Chief Economist,https://www.agriculture.com,[],06-12-2019,2019,6,https://www.agriculture.com/markets/newswire/usda-set-to-adjust-us-soy-numbers-in-july-report-chief-economist,"By Nigel Hunt

LONDON, June 12 (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Agriculture is set to revise its U.S. soybean forecasts next month after leaving area and yield projections unchanged in a monthly report issued on Tuesday, USDA chief economist Robert Johansson said.

USDA’s monthly World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates (WASDE) report cut corn area and yields following severe delays to plantings this season.

“I think conventional wisdom is that some of the corn acres would translate into bean acres and that translates into lower soybean prices,” Johansson said on the sidelines of a reception organised by the International Grains Council.

The U.S. soybean area was kept at 84.6 million acres and yield at 49.5 bushels an acre.

“I think we didn’t have information to go on right now to change those soybean numbers. I think we will see adjustments being made to the soybean crop in the July WASDE,” he said, adding it was a later planted crop than corn.

USDA on Tuesday raised its forecast for the average soybean farm price to $8.25 a bushel from $8.10.

The U.S. corn area was cut to 89.8 million acres from a previous forecast of 92.8 million, while the corn yield was downwardly revised to 166 bushels per acre from 176 bushels.

Johansson noted that the planting and emergence of the corn crop had been delayed.

“That is going to push the main grain filling period for corn into the hottest part of the summer,” he said, adding that typically could affect overall yield.

Johansson said an expected reduction in soybean demand from China linked to an outbreak of African swine fever in the world’s biggest hog herd was now “built into the market.”

Soybean meal is a major feed ingredient for hogs.

He noted that Rabobank had forecast China’s pork output would fall by 30%, which would dampen soybean prices. [nL3N21T33L}

Soybean crush numbers in China have, however, so far remained relatively constant, he added.

“We haven’t seen the crush numbers down as much in China as you might expect (if pork production was falling so sharply),” Johansson said, adding that might partly reflect increased demand from the poultry sector as Chinese consumers eat more chicken.

Johansson said there was “no question” the United States would like to have a trade agreement with Britain if the UK leaves the European Union.

He said there could be challenges similar to those faced in negotiations between Washington and the European Union to try to agree a Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership.

Differing views on food safety proved a stumbling block in those negotiations.

“There are some pretty hard decisions there,” he said, while adding he had faith in the ability of negotiators to bridge the gap. (Reporting by Nigel Hunt; editing by Dale Hudson)

The most unpopular president could win again in 2020,https://www.salon.com,[],06-12-2019,2019,6,https://www.salon.com/2019/06/12/the-most-unpopular-president-could-win-again-in-2020_partner/,"Donald Trump is the first president to ever be elected while being actively disliked by the majority of Americans. Trump was also the first person elected president who was significantly less popular than his counterpart.

Most Americans have heard of presidents losing the popular vote but winning the election. But to win while the majority of Americans oppose you? How is that possible?

Advertisement:

At the time of the election, Trump had the highest unfavorability rating in history, with over 61% of Americans having an “unfavorable” view or “disapproving” of Trump. (There’s also an “undecided” option.)

Luckily for Trump, he faced a historically unpopular opponent. Before 2016, no losing presidential candidate had had an unfavorable rating above 47%. But on election eve, Hillary Clinton’s was 52%, an unprecedented election in American history.

Pretty soon, Americans will start to hear nothing but polls, predictions and political forecasts in the news cycle for the 2020 elections. But, as a statistician and political polling expert, we think that there is one polling prediction device that will be overlooked and misunderstood: approval ratings.

Winning without the popular vote

History has been rather kind to presidents who didn’t win the popular vote. Trump is the fifth U.S. president to lose the popular vote and win the Electoral College.

Advertisement:

All presidents have experienced a bump in popularity between election and Inauguration Day. But only Trump still found his approval rating — the percent of Americans who approve of the way the president is handling his job — below 50% upon entering office.

According to FiveThirtyEight, the day Trump stepped into the White House, he had only a 45.5% approval rating. This stands in stark contrast to Barack Obama, for example, who took office with a 68% approval rating.

Moreover, Trump has the lowest approval average in history, at only 40%. The next lowest is Harry Truman at 45.4%.

These data clearly show that Trump is the least-liked president in American history. With such unpopularity, how could he possibly win again?

Approval ratings and reelection

While election forecasting has become increasingly complex with new prediction models and techniques, there is an unsung hero of polling predictions: the approval ratings.

Introduced by George Gallup in the late 1920s, presidential approval ratings aimed to gauge the level of public support for the sitting president at any given time during his presidency.

Advertisement:

Every single reelected president since approval rating polls began has had over a 50% approval rating when reelected, or been on an upward approval rating trend over 30 days before the election. If neither of those is satisfied, the incumbent loses.

It has been that simple.

As with any statistical analysis, the trends are more important than the raw numbers. The 2016 election was historically unprecedented in terms of favorability of the candidates, as is the political polarization of the U.S.

Look at the spread

We think that pollsters, and the general public, shouldn’t compare Trump’s approval ratings to past presidents.

What can be compared? The difference of highs and lows.

According to historical Gallup polls, Trump’s spread — the difference between the highest recorded and lowest recorded approval rating poll — has never been more than 13%.

Advertisement:

Not a single president since this type of robust polling began, back to Franklin D. Roosevelt, has ever shown this level of consistency in approval ratings. In fact, the next-smallest spread was 27%, for John F. Kennedy.

Trump’s approval ratings show that he has the strongest base in historical times.

2020 by the numbers

Advertisement:

There are still nine months to go until the first ballots will be cast in the race to the White House for 2020, and the Democratic nominee’s identity will most likely not be known for almost a year. Still, Trump’s chances of reelection are being discussed daily.

Trump’s approval ratings are unlikely to go over 50%, given his lackluster starting point. So what does he actually need to win?

A simple statistical model applied to recorded approval ratings shows Trump has been garnering higher and higher approval ratings since taking office. Put simply, his base is staying strong and even growing. This is in direct contrast to all presidents except Bill Clinton.

Past incumbent presidents followed the rule that 49% approval and above means winning reelection, and anything below meant no second term. But Trump did not start at, nor will most likely ever reach, that level of approval.

Advertisement:

Americans may again see something that, statistically speaking, has never been seen before. Approval ratings have high correlations with predicting the next president, but with Trump, the numbers are outside any historical trends.

The most unpopular winner ever may very likely win again.

State Department praises release of US resident from Iran,https://www.cnn.com,['Jennifer Hansler'],06-11-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/11/politics/state-department-nizar-zakka/index.html,"(CNN) The US State Department on Tuesday praised the release of Nizar Zakka after nearly four years of detention in Iran, expressing ""hope"" that it could be ""a positive sign for American detainees"" in that country.

Zakka, a Lebanese citizen with permanent US residency, was released after being held in Tehran for ""espionage"" since 2015. The 52-year-old was arrested in September of that year ""while attending a conference on women and sustainable development,"" according to Iran's semi-official state news agency Tasnim. He was convicted on espionage charges and sentenced to 10 years in prison in 2016.

Zakka, speaking with Al Arabiya following his release, said he was ""subjected to all kinds of torture from the Iranians"" when he was first arrested. He told the news outlet that the torture became psychological.

""I can't describe it. It's very hard to describe,"" he said of his detention in Iran's Evin prison.

In a statement, a State Department spokesperson hailed Zakka's release as ""without a doubt a great day for Mr. Zakka, his family, and all those who have supported him during his unlawful imprisonment.""

Carter Page says FBI informant 'intensified' communications just prior to FISA warrant,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Carter Page', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/fbi-informant-intensified-communications-just-prior-to-fisa-warrant-carter-page-says,"Former Trump foreign policy aide Carter Page said Sunday that U.S. intelligence informant Stefan Halper ""intensified"" communications with him as the FBI worked to obtain a secret surveillance warrant to monitor Page, shortly after he and Halper met for the first time at a research institute symposium in Cambridge, England, in July 2016.

Page's remarks on Fox News' ""Sunday Morning Futures"" come as the Justice Department is set to unearth new documents this week concerning the origins of the Russia probe. A DOJ court filing Thursday, meanwhile, provided more details about a crucial period just before Halper allegedly sprang into action to seek more information on future National Security Adviser Michael Flynn.

Within days of a January 2016 Flynn phone call to Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak referenced in the court filing, Russian-born U.K. academic Svetlana Lokhova said Halper suddenly contacted her to gain information on Flynn. Asked about the timing, a source familiar with the situation told Fox News that ""nothing is a coincidence"" when it comes to Halper, and that Kislyak was likely under U.S. surveillance.

""I had a longstanding relationship with Professor Halper,"" Page told host Maria Bartiromo. ""I always believe in 'innocent until proven guilty,' but my conversations with him intensified right in the month before my illegitimate FISA warrant in September 2016, when all these defamatory articles are being placed by the [Democratic National Committee].""

COMEY, BRENNAN SURROGATES DISPUTE WHO PUSHED DISCREDITED DOSSIER

Page has sued he DNC and other actors for defamation related to accusations that he was colluding with Russian agents. The FBI, in its Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) application, flatly called Page ""an agent of a foreign power."" Page has not been charged with any wrongdoing despite months of surveillance, and the dossier that the FBI relied upon in its FISA application has largely been discredited as a political document rife with inaccuracies.

In its warrant application, the FBI assured the FISA court on numerous occasions that other sources independently corroborated the dossier's claims but did not clearly state that the dossier's author worked for a firm hired by Hillary Clinton's campaign.

Page continued: ""Professor Halper was being very positive, you know, like a Harriet Tubman figure. He understands sort of the the injustices, or he presented himself as understanding that ...... and I sort of trusted him.""

The FBI formally opened its counterintelligence probe into the Trump campaign July 31, 2016, several days after Page says he first met Halper at the symposium. From 2012 to 2018, the Defense Department paid Halper more than $1 million for consulting work.

During the 2016 presidential campaign, Halper -- now widely reported to be a confidential FBI source -- also reached out to Trump campaign aides including Page, George Papadopoulos and Sam Clovis. (Papadopoulos separately told Fox News in May that in September 2016, a U.S. intelligence informant approached him in London seeking information, and attempted to ""seduce"" him as part of a ""bizarre"" episode."")

FOX NEWS EXCLUSIVE: INTERNAL FBI TEXT MESSAGES REVEAL HIGH-LEVEL DOJ DOUBTS ABOUT KEY FISA SOURCE

Ultimately, Page told Bartiromo, his actions, and those of other Trump campaign officials, were ""completely spun in the fake Mueller"" report to help advance what he characterized as Democrats' ""ridiculous"" goal of impeachment.

""Professor Halper was being very positive, like a Harriet Tubman figure. ... I sort of trusted him."" — Carter Page

""I had a longstanding relationship with the CIA, going back decades, essentially,"" Page said. ""I was always very transparent, open.""

North Carolina GOP Rep. Mark Meadows, also speaking to ""Fox News Sunday,"" backed up Page's assertion. Specifically, Meadows pointed to a report from The Hill's John Solomon, who found that Ukrainian businessman Konstantin Kilimnik, a key figure in Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report, was actually a U.S. informant. In his report, Mueller linked Kilimnik to Russian intelligence, and did not mention Kilimnik's secretive ties to the U.S. in the report other court filings -- even as Mueller suggested former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort's ties to Kilimnik were nefarious.

""The deeper the dive we take into the Mueller report, we're starting to find out some of the conclusions, and actually some of the facts they put forth in there, are a misrepresentation of what we actually know,"" Meadows said.

Meadows added that he expected DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz's investigation into potential FBI and DOJ surveillance misconduct to come out later than June, when it was originally expected. Meadows said more information has come to light that might necessitate the delay.

Page, for his part, told Bartiromo that he did not recall ever ""crossing paths"" with Kilimnik.

In a separate lawsuit filed last month, Lokhova accused Halper and various news media outlets of conspiring to defame her, by falsely claiming she had inappropriate contact with Flynn to further the narrative that Flynn was compromised by Russia.

The complaint asserted that ""Stefan Halper is a ratf----- and a spy, who embroiled an innocent woman in a conspiracy to undo the 2016 presidential election and topple the President of the United States of America.""

According to the lawsuit, ""On January 12, 2016, [Cambridge Professor Christopher] Andrew emailed Lokhova, and invited her and her partner, David North ('North'), to Andrew’s house to have dinner with Halper and his wife. Two dates in February were offered. Andrew stated that the purpose of the dinner was to discuss the book that Lokhova and he were authoring. Lokhova was perplexed. At no point before this unexpected invitation had Halper expressed any interest in Lokhova’s work.""

The complaint alleges, ""Halper had no interest in Lokhova’s work. Rather, Halper wanted to have dinner with Lokhova to probe her for information relating to Flynn in the hopes that his FBI handlers might find a basis upon which to file an application to conduct surveillance and spy on General Flynn.""

RUSSIAN-BORN UK ACADEMIC SAYS SHE'S BEING USED TO 'SMEAR' FLYNN

Halper has said virtually nothing in public about his role. During a rare interview with BBC Radio 4 Today in May 2017, Halper was asked if the Trump FBI inquiry was of Watergate proportions. He responded that the probe was ""moving in that direction.""

Multiple independent reviews into potential FBI and DOJ misconduct in 2016 are ongoing. John Durham, the Connecticut U.S. attorney assigned by Attorney General Bill Barr to investigate the origins of the Russia probe, is “very dialed in” and “asking all the right questions,” according to multiple sources familiar with the matter.

Separately, sources within the Justice Department confirmed to Fox News last week that Barr has met “on multiple occasions in recent weeks” with Durham, who was in Washington, D.C., this month.

'Dangerous Proposal': USDA Seeking to Replace Government Inspectors at Beef Slaughter Plants With Private Employees,https://www.ecowatch.com,"['Common Dreams', 'The Conversation', 'Jordan Davidson', 'Madison Dapcevich', 'Climate Nexus', 'Deutsche Welle']",06-11-2019,2019,6,https://www.ecowatch.com/usda-inspectors-deregulation-2638771530.html,"By Julia Conley

In an apparent effort to boost profits for meat manufacturers despite potential harms to food safety, the U.S. Department of Agriculture is reportedly planning to privatize inspections of beef slaughter plants.

""This dangerous proposal could rid beef slaughter plants of most government inspectors,"" Food and Water Watch said in a statement.

The group released an application from beef, pork, and poultry manufacturer Tyson Foods, in which the company requested a waiver to allow Tyson employees to conduct more inspections at its beef plant in Holcolm, Kansas, instead of relying on USDA food safety inspectors.

Food and Water Watch reported Monday that the USDA is pursuing deregulation of the food inspection system that has been used for years at beef slaughterhouses. The information came from documents obtained through the Freedom of Information Act.

BREAKING: We have obtained documents that confirm the USDA is seeking to privatize inspections of beef slaughterhouses. This dangerous proposal could rid beef slaughter plants of most government inspectors. https://t.co/jNospAvLYn pic.twitter.com/cbx4fo6lHy

The documents were uncovered after many recent denials by USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) that it plans to privatize inspections of mass-produced beef, Food and Water Watch stated.

Tyson's proposal comes 21 years after FSIS first launched a pilot program in more than two dozen poultry and pork plants in which government food safety inspectors were replaced by the manufacturers' own inspectors, allowing the companies to regulate themselves.

In 2013, the USDA's inspector general found that the agency ""did not critically assess whether the new inspection process had measurably improved food safety at each plant"" that produced pork.

The following year, FSIS expanded the program to the entire poultry industry. The agency will not conduct an assessment of the new system's effects on food safety until 2022.

""The previous attempts at privatized inspection have led to weaker food safety performance and are a ploy by the industry to increase line speeds,"" said Tony Corbo, a senior lobbyist with Food and Water Watch.

Despite a lack of evidence that the privatized food safety inspection system is making food safer — and CDC data showing that foodborne illnesses from foods including chicken have been on the rise since 2015 — FSIS is weakening standards in order to increase the speed with which meat is processed, allowing for greater manufacturing profits.

""The Tyson plant in Holcomb, Kansas is approved to operate at the current maximum line speed allowable"" said Corbo. ""FSIS management has had difficulty meeting its inspection staffing requirements in the past in western Kansas, which has contributed to beef slaughter plants not being able to maintain maximum line speeds. Tyson's solution seems to be to get rid of the government inspectors."""
Trump appoints Social Security Administration watchdog to also oversee Interior,https://thehill.com,[],06-10-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/447713-trump-appoints-social-security-administration-watchdog-to-also,"President Trump Donald John TrumpTrump judicial nominee withdraws amid Republican opposition: report Trump judicial nominee withdraws amid Republican opposition: report Cummings offers to delay contempt vote for Wednesday deadline on subpoenaed census docs MORE has quietly appointed his Social Security Administration (SSA) inspector general to also oversee a much different agency: the Interior Department.

On May 28, Gail Ennis began her second job overseeing the Interior Department’s Office of the Inspector General (OIG), a role she will keep for the foreseeable future, the OIG confirmed to The Hill.

The Trump administration is still awaiting the confirmation of Mark Greenblatt, the former assistant inspector general for investigations at the Commerce Department, to formally head the Interior’s OIG office.

Ennis was sworn into the SSA role just five months ago, her first time serving as an inspector general. Her professional background is in securities litigation, working previously as a partner at the Washington, D.C.-based law firm WilmerHale, where she reportedly earned $2 million a year.

At the SSA, Ennis has most recently led efforts to thwart scam Social Security phone calls, at the Interior department she will oversee investigations into Interior’s newly appointed Secretary David Bernhardt's lobbying ties and two ongoing Justice Department investigations into former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke Ryan Keith ZinkeOvernight Energy: Trump appoints Social Security watchdog to also oversee Interior | Critics question EPA guidance on pipelines | Battle over science roils EPA Overnight Energy: Trump appoints Social Security watchdog to also oversee Interior | Critics question EPA guidance on pipelines | Battle over science roils EPA Trump appoints Social Security Administration watchdog to also oversee Interior MORE. One of those investigations has reportedly made it to the grand jury.

The appointment of Ennis to Interior was not formally announced by the White House, however, the Interior Department’s website was updated last week to reflect her new position.

Ennis replaces former acting Inspector General Mary Kendall, who retired from the office at the end of May. Kendall oversaw multiple ethics investigations into Zinke, including recommending a number of them to the Justice Department for further investigation. Those investigations reportedly played a heavy factor in Zinke’s decision to leave the administration early this year.

Ennis is the second Trump political appointee whom the administration has attempted to put in the Interior OIG role.

Earlier this year, Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Ben Carson Benjamin (Ben) Solomon CarsonLawmakers say major changes needed to expand access to affordable housing Lawmakers say major changes needed to expand access to affordable housing Trump appoints Social Security Administration watchdog to also oversee Interior MORE announced to staff that Assistant HUD Secretary Suzanne Israel Tufts would replace Kendall. Because Tufts had been previously confirmed by the Senate, she would not have to go through another confirmation process for the role.

However, following backlash to that announcement, the Interior Department later said the announcement was a misunderstanding and Carson reversed the move. Tufts resigned not long after.

“On May 28th, Social Security [Inspector General] Gail S. Ennis started at [Department of Interior] OIG as Acting Inspector General. Continuing with her responsibilities as SSA IG, Ms. Ennis will also lead our organization while Mark Greenblatt’s nomination continues to progress in the Senate,” an OIG spokesperson said in a statement to The Hill.

The White House referred comment to the Interior OIG. The Interior Department did not return a request for comment.

In addition to the ongoing investigations into Interior's current and former secretaries, the OIG is also investigating six high-ranking interior officials for ethics concerns.

Wilmer Hale, the law firm where Ennis previously worked as a partner, lobbies for a number of clients with business before Interior. For example, the law firm represents Twin Metals a Minnesota based mineral mining company that is lobbing to build a hotly debated copper-nickel mine near the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness. In May, the Trump administration moved to renew one of the mine's mineral leases, reversing a decision from the Obama administration.

Ennis, who was not a registered lobbyist, said the Interior OIG ethics office is currently reviewing her former clients.

""DOI OIG General Counsel is conducting a thorough ethics review that will ensure that I do not participate in any matter that would create a conflict of interest or an appearance of a conflict of interest,"" Ennis told the Hill in a statement.

Annapolis Housing Authority's 2018 inspections score low by Housing and Urban Development,https://www.capitalgazette.com,['Naomi Harris'],06-11-2019,2019,6,https://www.capitalgazette.com/news/annapolis/ac-cn-housing-authority-inspections-20190611-story.html,"The most recent federal inspections of Housing Authority of the City of Annapolis properties from 2018 showed poor scores of most properties with some, including Newtowne 20 and Morris H. Blum, showing no improvement from prior inspections.

According to the physical inspections conducted by Housing and Urban Development, the housing authority received scores below 60 out of 100 in 2018 with a 39 for Newtowne 20, a 51 for Morris H. Blum and a 41 for Robinwood. HUD, which distributes funding to the housing authority, did not provide scores for Harbor House Apartments/Eastport Terrace and Bloomsbury Square for 2018. Bloomsbury Square did not require an inspection last year because of a high score the prior year, at 81.

Residents from Annapolis public housing properties filed a lawsuit last month against the city and the housing authority stating the city failed to inspect and license properties. Residents in the lawsuit claim they lived in deplorable conditions and cited issues like water damage, sewage leaks and mold.

Through a random sampling of apartment units, federal inspectors review a property site including the building exterior, common area, units and the building system. The weight of the scoring comes down to what is called the “exigent health and safety” (EHS).

“Examples of EHS deficiencies include blocking of emergency fire exits, exposed wires and missing or inoperable smoke detectors,” HUD regional public affairs officer Nika Edwards said via email.

For properties that have one of those deficiencies, the public housing agency must address issues HUD identifies immediately and notify HUD they have been addressed within 72 hours, according to Edwards. HUD identified those deficiencies at Newtowne 20, Morris H. Blum and Robinwood.

According to physical inspection report by HUD, Morris H. Blum has declined in score each year since 2015. In 2015, the property received a high score of 87 but two years later dropped to 66 and even lower with a 51 in 2018.

Harbor House went from a score of 62 in 2015 to 46 in 2016 and an increase to 54 by 2017. Other properties have ranked relatively low as well.

Robinwood went from 63 in 2015 to 30 by 2017 and 50 later that year. Newtowne 20 saw an extreme decline that has not gotten substantially better. In 2015, the property earned an 81 but in 2017 HUD inspectors gave Newtowne a 29 in January and then a 34 in October.

Housing authority officials did not respond for comment regarding the scores.

When a public housing property scores less than 80 it must be inspected every year. If the score is between 80 and 89, properties are inspected every two years and from 90 to 100, it is inspected every three.

As part of the physical inspections of public housing properties, HUD inspectors look at factors like overgrown vegetation, water leaks, health and safety, and the state of apartments or units to determine if the condition is decent, sanitary and safe, according to guidance regulation documents.

According to Edwards, the public housing team in Baltimore has worked with the housing authority by providing technical assistance to “think through other options,” when it comes to preserving affordable housing.

“Ultimately, we need to be thinking of what is best for the residents and the quality of life. What can we do to preserve it and what long terms strategies can we look to -- to make a significant impact,” Edwards said.

The inspection routine is also undergoing changes after the federal agency realized housing authorities and private owners of HUD-subsidized housing have become used to the inspection process. One of the changes will be a shift from a 90 to 120 notification of inspection to 14 days.

Executive director of the housing authority and others are looking for ways to fund redevelopment of Newtowne 20. In May, Beverly Wilbourn and her agency applied for two programs through HUD for Section 18 federal subsidies, which can be used for obsolete properties, and 4% tax credits.

The agency hopes to start relocation in August or September, according to Wilbourn. The goal is to demolish and rebuild the property, which is made up of 78 aged units, in early 2020.

As a young adult, Ronnie Werner protested the war in Vietnam, fought for civil rights and supported a 42-year-old Democrat, Robert F Kennedy, in her first election in 1968. Forty years later, her home served as the local headquarters for then-Sen. Barack Obama’s presidential campaign, as she urged her fellow Democrats to embrace new leadership.

That was then. Now, as Democrats grapple with the possibility that President Donald Trump could win four more years in the White House, Werner feels that betting on the next generation is a risk she can’t afford to take.

“We’re in such terrible straits that everything I’ve worked for my entire professional, personal life is about to go down the toilet,” said Werner, 72, as she waited to see former Vice President Joe Biden at a pizza parlor in Hampton. “Young people, I think they are hungry for change and they deserve change, but they don’t know how scary this is.”

The political power of generational change, a constant in Democratic politics and in victorious presidential campaigns for much of the past 60 years, is being hotly debated as the party wrestles with how to defeat Trump.

Age has never defined a race so sharply before. The 23 Democrats include one of the youngest presidential candidates in modern history and the oldest one, spanning four generations — from 37-year-old Pete Buttigieg, mayor of South Bend, Indiana, to 77-year-old Bernie Sanders, senator from Vermont.

“The age thing is going to be one of the wedges by the time we get to the caucus next year,” said Bryce Smith, the 27-year-old Democratic chairman in Dallas County, a fast-growing suburb of Des Moines, Iowa. “It’s that question of experience versus new leadership.”

Interviews with more than three dozen voters, strategists and officials in recent weeks showed Democrats struggling not only with the question of how old, exactly, was too old but also with whether it was time to turn over the country’s most powerful office to a new generation.

Democratic midterm wins ushered in a diverse wave of younger politicians, assisted by record turnout from young voters. Twenty-four Democrats under the age of 40 entered Congress, a fourfold increase from just two years ago. While the three most powerful House Democrats are in their late 70s, the party’s youngest members, like 29-year-old Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, exert tremendous influence over its agenda. Their victories boosted expectations that youth could be an asset in the presidential race.

Yet, at a time of ascendancy for younger Democrats, some worry there may be political peril in nominating a younger politician to challenge the 72-year-old Trump. It’s a notable shift for a party that has traditionally won the White House by embracing the ethos of a new generation in candidates like Obama in 2008, Bill Clinton in 1992 and John F. Kennedy in 1960.

The two men leading most national polls — Sanders and Biden — would be over 80 by the time they finished their first term in office, beating out Trump to become the oldest of any president elected to a first term. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who polls in third place in many surveys, will be 71 on Election Day.

Their age cuts a striking contrast with many of their rivals: Biden won his first statewide race for Senate in 1972, before eight of the Democratic candidates had been born. When Sanders entered Congress in 1990, 10 of his opponents had not yet graduated from college. Both men were the only candidates in federal office during the fall of the Berlin Wall, the first invasion of Iraq and the first major generational transition for their party in more than three decades — the election of Clinton in 1992.

“If you think about Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, they really almost represent the very late years of the silent generation,” said Neil Howe, a generational demographer who coined the phrase “millennial generation” in 1991.

Biden has repeatedly said that it is fair to question his age, announcing that he plans to release his medical records before the general election. But Sanders, pointing to his good health, has dismissed questions about his age as less important than those about his positions.

“At the end of the day, it’s not whether you’re young or whether you’re old — it’s what you believe in,” argued Sanders during a Fox News town hall in April.

Meanwhile, younger candidates have made their age a central part of their primary message, arguing they’re better prepared to embrace the new solutions needed to tackle issues like climate change, health care and the changing economy. A survey released by the Pew Research Center this month found that just 3% of Americans say candidates in their 70s are ideal for the office.

“The world has changed so rapidly and we need what comes with a generational shift — new ideas, new approaches, new ways of doing things,” said Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio, 45, who describes his age as one of his strongest assets.

Buttigieg has made “intergenerational justice” the central theme of his candidacy, often saying he worries about what the United States will be like in 2054 — the year he will be Trump’s current age.

In an interview, Buttigieg said he references that year to try to encourage Democrats to look beyond defeating the president.

“What’s helpful, I think, with the generational energy that a young candidate can bring, is being able to put a very quick face on the urgency of dealing with things for the future,” he said. “When we’re trying to design that world, substantively, it points you to a place that’s more favorable turf for Democrats.”

Historically, Democratic nominees and presidents have been younger than their Republican counterparts. The two Democratic nominees who have won the White House since 1992 — Clinton and Obama — cast themselves as agents of generational change.

“Political parties are like anything else; they have to refresh themselves,” said James Carville, a chief strategist of Clinton’s 1992 victory. “The country, in 1992 and 2008, had great angst and dissatisfaction with things. I certainly see that now.”

In the early months of the Democratic primary, a fairly significant split has developed between younger and older voters. While Biden leads the Democratic field across demographic groups, polling shows him with a far bigger advantage among voters over age 55. That’s a powerful cohort to have backing his bid: In 2016, voters older than 45 cast 60% of all votes in the 2016 primary, according to an analysis of exit polling.

But the dominance of older voters at the polls may not hold in 2020. This presidential race is likely to be the first election in which voters under 40 make up the same proportion of the electorate as voters over 55 — nearly 40% of the electorate, according to some early projections. Generation Z, Millennials and Generation X outvoted older generations in the 2018 midterms, and early surveys show them on track to turn out in far greater numbers in next year’s primary contests than they did four years ago.

“The generational gap is growing larger,” said John Della Volpe, the director of polling at the Harvard Institute of Politics, which regularly surveys young voters. “Younger people believe they’ve been on the short end of the stick for a generation now.”

Polling shows that younger voters lean more to the left than their parents do, with a majority saying they support programs like government-run health insurance, free college and action to curb climate change. In polling conducted by Harvard University in March, only 16% of 18- to 29-year-olds said they agreed with the statement that “elected officials who are part of the Baby Boomer generation care about people like me.”

They are also more likely to embrace the possibility of a history-making candidate, expressing greater enthusiasm for a female nominee.

“I’m ready for someone who’s not an older white man,” said Meg Thode, 21, a recent college graduate. “The country doesn’t look the same way it did 20, 30, 40 years ago.”

Some younger voters say they question whether the older candidates really understand the increasing diversity of the country and the kinds of economic challenges younger people face.

“It seems like the younger politicians understand the issues that are on our minds more,” said Rachel Felorman, a 19-year-old student in New Hampshire. “Look who’s taking the most action on climate change, on affordable health care and affordable tuition.”

But Della Volpe cautions that age alone is unlikely to determine the millennial and Generation Z vote, pointing to the strong support that Sanders had from young voters during his 2016 primary campaign. Early polling in this race shows Sanders leading among younger voters. Rising generations are rarely represented by presidents their own age, Howe said.

“It’s one thing for the government to reflect that younger generation. It’s a very different thing to say that means that someone from that generation has to be elected,” he said. “An interesting question is, could Bernie Sanders be the great champion for the millennial generation?”"
Just One Tiny Industry May Emit More Methane Than EPA Had Estimated for All of Them,https://earther.gizmodo.com,"['Yessenia Funes', 'About The Author', 'I Mostly Write About How Environmental Policy', 'Climate Change Intersect With Race', 'Class Though I Occasionally Write About Animals', 'Science', 'Art', 'Too.

People tend to equate methane with cow farts (though their burps are worse), but we may be pointing our fingers in all the wrong places, according to a new study. The production of ammonia for fertilizer may result in up to 100 times more emissions than has been previously estimated for this sector. And that alone is more than what the Environmental Protection Agency estimates all industries emit across the U.S.

The study, published May 28 in the journal Elementa, zooms into the ammonia fertilizer industry because it relies heavily on natural gas to run its production plants. Ammonia is a compound made of nitrogen, which is used across the agriculture sector to fuel the growth of crops. While the ammonia fertilizer industry’s emissions of carbon dioxide are better understood, emissions of methane—which has 25 times the global warming potential of carbon dioxide over a century—were a huge question mark. Until now.

The team of authors from Cornell University and the Environmental Defense Fund had two sampling adventures in June 2015 and September 2016 that took them to six ammonia fertilizer plants in the Midwest, including Oklahoma, Kansas, and Iowa. They used their findings to estimate industry-wide emissions throughout the U.S. The team found that the fertilizer industry results in 29 gigagrams of methane emissions a year. The EPA, however, reports this industry emitted only 0.2 gigagrams of methane a year between 2015 and 2016. As for all industries (like waste, chemical, and metals production), the EPA estimates 8 gigagrams, which is still much smaller than this single industry’s.

A worst case scenario—where other plants are consuming more natural gas than the ones analyzed—resulted in methane emissions that reached 139 gigagrams a year. For context, that’s equivalent to the carbon emissions from 669,314 passenger vehicles driven in a year. Or more than the carbon emitted from 3 billion pounds of coal burned. Best case scenario, the emissions are just 2 gigagrams of methane a year, which is still a lot more than what the EPA currently estimates for this industry.

That is pretty wild, but this is an estimate based only on six plants. They make up more than 25 percent of the 23 plants operating in 2016 and are also of varying sizes to represent the different facilities throughout the U.S., so the six are a pretty good sample. But the authors would like to examine more plants to be sure.

The researchers drove downwind from the facilities in a Google Street View car decked out with a killer methane analyzer that recorded the methane levels in the air. That way, the team was able to capture the methane emissions near the facility in the areas where wind was likely to push it. This poses some limitations, though, because not every plant had the best road access. The authors recommend looking at airborne measurements next time, too. The team looked at samples over just a few days in a single month over these two years. Capturing a longer timeline of data could further verify (or disprove!) their analysis.

Methane emissions feel especially relevant these days. The Trump administration has been attempting to roll back methane regulations since President Awful took office. (The Department of Energy actually called natural gas “freedom gas” the other day.) A coalition of states and environmental groups like the Sierra Club pressed a judge Friday to stop Trump from rolling back these protections, reports E&E News.

Methane isn’t just dangerous for our planet because it’s worsening climate change; its emissions are often coupled with particulate matter and other air pollutants that pose threats to the health of communities closest to the facilities where it’s being emitted.

Justice Department backs parents suing Maine over tuition for religious schools,https://www.pressherald.com,"['Follow On Twitter', 'Email Writer']",06-11-2019,2019,6,https://www.pressherald.com/2019/06/11/doj-expresses-support-for-plaintiffs-in-maine-religious-school-tuition-case/,"The U.S. Department of Justice has thrown its support behind a small group of Maine parents who have filed a federal lawsuit seeking reimbursement for their children’s religious school tuition.

The department filed a “letter of interest” in U.S. District Court in Portland on Monday expressing its opinion about the Maine case, Carson v. Makin. It sided strongly with the plaintiffs, citing DOJ guidance that “government may not target persons or individuals because of their religion,” and “individuals do not give up their religious-liberty protections by providing or receiving social services, education or healthcare.”

Related Headlines Families’ lawsuit challenges Maine law against public funding for religious schools

Three married couples in central Maine filed the lawsuit in August 2018 against the state Department of Education over a decades-old Maine law that bars tuition reimbursements for religious schools. Oral arguments in the lawsuit are scheduled for June 24 at the federal courthouse in Portland.

Local school administrative units in Maine that do not have their own secondary schools can pay a certain amount in tuition for students to attend outside public or private schools. But that money cannot be used at religious schools, a policy that the parents’ legal complaint calls discriminatory and unconstitutional.

The plaintiffs, led by Glenburn residents David and Amy Carson, are represented by two national groups that describe themselves as advocates for religious liberty and school choice. The lawsuit comes at a time when the Trump administration has made the push for alternatives to public schools central to the national education policy debate.

DOJ spokeswoman Kelly Laco said in an email that the protection of religious freedom is a top priority for the department.

In July 2018, the DOJ announced the formation of the Religious Liberty Task Force, which brings together department components to coordinate their work on religious freedom litigation and policy, and to implement former U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ 2017 religious liberty guidance, Laco said.

“That guidance was issued at the direction of President Trump’s May 4, 2017, executive order promoting free speech and religious liberty,” she said.

Laco did not respond to a follow-up email asking if the Department of Justice plans to get involved further in the case, such as by participating in oral arguments.

Zachary Heiden, legal director for the American Civil Liberties Union of Maine, said his organization joined the case as a “friend of the court” arguing in favor of upholding the state’s ban on tuition reimbursement for religious schools.

Heiden said he has read the DOJ’s letter and found that its legal arguments primarily echo those made by the plaintiffs in their original complaint. He said it’s not unusual for the department to file a letter of interest in a case in which it has an opinion.

“This is what they do,” Heiden said. “This is one of the ways in which the Department of Justice does its job.”

He said the impact of the lawsuit’s outcome will be limited in scope because the existing law only applies to certain small communities in Maine. However, it could be used as precedent in other related cases.

Heiden believes the plaintiffs have an uphill battle. The same state law has been challenged four times in various state and federal courts, he said, and in all four cases the plaintiffs have lost.

“Those courts have always said that this Maine law is constitutional, is permissible,” Heiden said. “That law hasn’t changed. The First Amendment hasn’t changed. So it would be quite significant for the court to now say that, actually, the Maine law violates the Constitution.”

More than 30 states have constitutional amendments that prohibit state funding of religious organizations, including schools. Though Maine is not one of them, it passed a law in 1981 that bars public funding for sectarian schools. Legislative efforts to expand school choice and give taxpayer money to religious schools have failed to gain traction in recent years.

One of the groups representing the plaintiffs in Carson v. Makin, the Virginia-based Institute for Justice, a nonprofit libertarian public-interest law firm, has said it decided to challenge the Maine law again in light of a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in 2017.

In that case, Trinity Lutheran Church in Missouri was barred from participating in a state program that reimburses the cost of rubberizing playground surfaces. The nation’s highest court ultimately decided the church should be eligible for that public funding. Advocates for public funding of religious schools hope that case will serve as legal precedent to advance their own interests.

But Heiden said he doesn’t see a strong connection between the Missouri case and the one in Maine.

“I disagree with their interpretation of that (Missouri) case,” he said. “It’s about … shredded rubber tires on playground surfaces, which I don’t think is the same thing as funding education. But obviously the DOJ has a different interpretation of that.”

Former U.S. Interior Secretary and REI board member Sally Jewell has been tapped as interim CEO of The Nature Conservancy, after resignations of top brass and a law firm's critical report on its work environment for women.

Jewell will take her post on Sept. 3. The appointment follows the resignation Friday of Nature Conservancy CEO Mark Tercek, a week after he asked for the resignation of Conservancy president Brian McPeek. Its Caribbean director exited last week.

The Nature Conservancy is the world's largest environmental organization, with $1.3 billion in revenues for 2018.

RELATED: Sally Jewell: UW will hear from and honor one of its own

It has been a shaping force for conservation in Washington, with acquisitions small (Yellow Island in the San Juans) and large (restoration of Ellsworth Creek in Southwest Washington). It has undertaken ambitious projects such as preserving Moses Coulee in Central Washington.

The Nature Conservancy was a major supporter of Initiative 1631, the carbon fee on last fall's Washington ballot.

""Our strength has always been in our people, and we recognize this comes with great responsibility to provide this team a supportive, open and inclusive work environment so everyone can thrive,"" Jewell said in accepting her new post.

The new chair of The Nature Conservancy will be former Alaska Gov. Fran Ulmer, current chair of the Arctic Research Commission.

Jewell was promoted for the interior job, in Obama's second term, by Seattle super lawyer Gerry Grinstein, and won Senate confirmation on a bipartisan 87-11 vote. She started on a hesitant note, but became a Cabinet star as Obama made multiple national monument designations.

The designations included monuments in the California desert and the ""Lost Coast"" of Northern California, expansion of the Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument on the Oregon-California border, and the big Organ Mountains Desert Peaks National Monument in New Mexico.

President Donald Trump has set out to eviscerate the Bears Ears National Monument in southeast Utah, designated just before Obama left office. The Trump administration is seeking to reduce its size from 1.3 million acres to just 201,000 acres.

It is the largest reduction in public land protection in American history. A major court fight is shaking up.

Sally Jewell has been on The Nature Conservancy's board of directors.

She was known, at the Interior Department, for getting around, and took Obama as far afield as Alaska's Kenai Fjords National Park.

VA owes $190 million to disabled veterans improperly charged home loan fees,https://www.foxnews.com,['Robert Gearty'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/va-owes-190-million-to-disabled-veterans-improperly-charged-home-loan-fees,"The Department of Veterans Affairs owes about $189 million to 53,000 disabled veterans who were charged home loan fees they were exempt from having to pay, an investigation has found.

These veterans were charged the fees under the VA’s Home Loan Guaranty Program and now may be entitled to refunds ranging from $5,000 to $20,000, a VA Inspector General audit released Thursday found.

VA loan managers knew disabled vets were being charged the fees improperly since 2014 but never did anything about it, VA IG auditors determined.

“OIG finds it troubling that senior (Veterans Benefits Administration) management was aware that thousands of veterans were potentially owed more than $150 million yet did not take adequate actions to ensure refunds were issued,” the IG report says.

DOZENS OF ATTORNEYS GENERAL ASK BETSY DEVOS TO FORGIVE DISABLED VETS STUDENTS LOANS

The loan managers told the IG they were focused on other priorities, including processing high volumes of applications, USA Today reported.

The report faulted the Veterans Benefits Administration for placing the burden on a disabled vet to submit a claim for a refund.

The VA announced last month that it was notifying veterans when they buy homes through the Home Loan program that they are exempt from the fees if they are disabled or later determined to be disabled, the paper reported.

“Through an internal quality improvement effort, VA has put a plan in place to better inform veterans through key communications when the law allows VA to waive the fee for a veteran,” the announcement quoted VA Secretary Robert Wilkie as saying.

The Veterans Benefits Administration told the IG that it would identify exempt veterans who paid the fees and issue them refunds and that the financial impact to the veterans was minimal over the life of the loan, The Washington Post reported.
