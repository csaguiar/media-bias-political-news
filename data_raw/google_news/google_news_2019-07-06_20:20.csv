"GOP senators urge Trump to reject Iran's ‘nuclear blackmail,’ seek to ‘snapback’ sanctions at the UN",https://www.foxnews.com,['Ben Evansky'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/gop-senators-trump-iran-nuclear-blackmail-sanctions-snapback,"Three GOP senators this week urged President Trump to reject what they describe as Iran’s ‘nuclear blackmail’ in the wake of the rogue nation’s violation of the 2015 nuclear agreement -- and highlighted the use of a mechanism in the U.N. resolution enshrining the deal that allows for a “snapback” of sanctions.

“Regime officials have signaled they intend to creep towards a nuclear weapon, while demanding concessions and promising to ‘reverse’ their violations if their demands are met,” Sens. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, Tom Cotton, R-Ark., and Marco Rubio, R-Fla., wrote in a letter Tuesday. “We urge you to reject their nuclear blackmail.”

COTTON MOCKS IRAN OFFICIAL'S SANCTIONS COMPLAINT: WON'T BE ABLE TO SPEND IRANIANS' MONEY IN '5-STAR RESTAURANTS'

Iran recently began stockpiling low-enriched uranium beyond agreed limits, in violation of the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), and have warned that more violations could soon be coming.

Given that it was United Nations Security Council resolution 2231 that endorsed the Obama-era deal, the Council could be the site of the next stage in deciding the embattled deal’s fate. Trump pulled the U.S. out of the deal last year, having described it as “the worst deal in history,” and the administration has since imposed waves of crippling economic sanctions on Tehran.

The senators urge Trump to invoke the so-called “snapback mechanism” in resolution 2231 that would restore sanctions on Iran’s uranium enrichment and missile development.

And while Security Council diplomats seek to work out how the U.S. will re-impose the sanctions given that it quit the deal last year, the letter from the senators notes that the U.N. resolution enables the original parties to the deal to revoke or snapback at any time.

“Paragraph 10 of the resolution defines the United States as a participant for the purpose of invoking the mechanism. We urge you to do so,” the senators wrote.

The lawmakers also call on the president to cease the use of “civil-nuclear waivers” that they say allows Iran to keep a nuclear status quo.

While the preferred mechanism for disputes in the JCPOA is that they be dealt with by a joint commission of eight members to decide if it goes to the Security Council, Tehran’s threats to enrich uranium mean the process of bringing the snapback mechanism into effect will sooner rather than later be tested.

From 2006 onwards the Council passed six resolutions that imposed severe sanctions on Iran in order to halt its nuclear ambitions by banning Iran from conducting nuclear research and developing ballistic missiles.

TRUMP VOWS IRAN CANNOT HAVE PATH TO NUKES, SAYS HE HOPES SANCTIONS SENT 'MESSAGE'

The senators letter also claimed that the deal “was built to enable Iranian cheating” and allowed hundreds of billions of dollars to flow into regime coffers, “allowing the Iranians to boost its military and terrorist activities regionally and globally, even as they maintained nuclear weapons infrastructure, periodically exceeded restrictions on nuclear materials.”

“That’s how the deal was always supposed to work, that’s how it did work, and that’s why it is imperative that the United States now respond forcefully to Iran’s systematic violations by ending civil-nuclear waivers and invoking the U.N. snapback,” the senators argued.

It is unclear how such a move would be received by America’s European allies at the Security Council -- who opposed the U.S. departure from the deal, and who have fought to keep the compact intact.

Behnam Ben Taleblu a Senior Fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies in Washington D.C. told Fox News that if the snapback mechanism is used and resolution 2231 is done away with, “it would also mean the Rouhani government’s policy of playing both sides of the Atlantic against one another would have failed.”

A source familiar with the administration’s discussions on the use of snapback told Fox News that there are ongoing interagency talks happening now about using the mechanism.

An indication of the interagency discussions came earlier in the week from Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, whose statement on Iran’s violation called on the international community to restore its longstanding requirement of not allowing any uranium enrichment for the regime’s nuclear program in light of Iran’s latest violation.

His statement pulled no punches as he noted that “no nuclear deal should ever allow the Iranian regime to enrich uranium at any level. Starting in 2006, the United Nations Security Council passed six resolutions requiring the regime to suspend all enrichment activity. It was the right standard then; it is the right standard now.”

A senior GOP congressional staffer told Fox News: “Snapback is quickly becoming the only game in town, now that Iran has violated the deal.”

The staffer told Fox that, even though the U.S. left the deal, the administration still has every right per the resolution to put the snapback mechanism into play.

“There's no technical reason the Trump administration can't just do it and quickly restore the international sanctions from before the deal,” the staffer stated, adding that some officials wanted to hold off while the Europeans negotiated with Iran to stay in bounds.

“Now that the Europeans have failed and the Iranians are engaged in nuclear blackmail, there's no reason left to hold off.”"
Honeybees hit by Trump budget cuts,https://www.cnn.com,['Sam Fossum'],07-06-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/06/politics/honeybees-study-usda-donald-trump-budget-cuts/index.html,"Washington (CNN) The US Department of Agriculture has suspended data collection for its annual Honey Bee Colonies report, citing cost cuts -- a move that robs researchers and the honeybee industry of a critical tool for understanding honeybee population declines , and comes as the USDA is curtailing other research programs .

It's also another step toward undoing President Barack Obama's government-wide focus on protecting pollinators , including bees and butterflies, whose populations have plummeted in recent years.

The annual survey, which started in 2015, gathers data on the number of honeybees per state by quarter, including those being lost with symptoms of colony collapse disorder, an issue that's made honeybees a darling of environmentalists and climate activists.

It is at least the third bee-related dataset to be suspended under the current administration.

""The decision to suspend data collection was not made lightly, but was necessary given available fiscal and program resources,"" according to a notice posted by the USDA's National Agricultural Statistics Survey. The USDA would not provide a figure for how much the agency was saving by discontinuing the survey.

The suspension is ""temporary,"" according to a USDA spokesperson, who did not say when or if it would be resumed. This year's report, scheduled to be released in August, will only include part-year data.

Outside groups that have been critical of the administration see the move as another way to undermine federal research.

""This is yet another example of the Trump administration systematically undermining federal research on food safety, farm productivity, and the public interest writ large,"" said Rebecca Boehm, an economist at the Union of Concerned Scientists.

Tracking honeybee loss

The USDA survey is one of two national surveys that tracks honeybee loss and the only one overseen by the federal government. The other survey, run by the Bee Informed Partnership, has been tracking data for longer and relies on grant funding, including from the USDA, to support its work. The USDA survey is considered to be a more statistically accurate survey, since it has access to the list of all registered bee keepers in the US, but it has only been gathering data since 2015.

Researchers at the USDA's Economic Research Service described the dataset as valuable and important for beekeepers and other stakeholders like the honey industry and farmers whose crops rely on honeybees to pollinate them.

""We're concerned about whether honeybee colony losses are still high and whether we're making any progress in bringing them down,"" said Peyton Ferrier, an economist at USDA who conducts research on how honeybee health affects the agriculture industry.

Bees help pollinate a third of the crops we eat, including almonds, apples, avocados and grapes, but bee populations have been steadily declining since 2006. That's caused alarm not just in the US but in Europe as well. Pollinators like bees are under threat because of parasites like varroa mites, widespread pesticide use, habitat loss and the climate crisis.

In 2014, the Obama administration launched a program to address honeybee population losses , directing federal agencies to work toward preserving bee and other pollinator populations.

Last year, the Trump administration reversed an Obama-era rule barring the use of neonicotinoids, a chemical family that is one of the major culprits in colony collapse disorder, in wildlife refuges. And the Environmental Protection Agency has granted ""emergency"" permissions to 18 states to spray an insecticide that's considered ""highly toxic"" to bees.

Two other surveys have been suspended or scaled back in the last year. The Cost of Pollination survey, which tracked how farmers pay for honeybees to pollinate their crops, was suspended in 2018, and the Honey survey -- which gathers information on honey production -- has been scaled back to cut data collection on beekeeping operations that have less than five colonies.

Understanding what's going on with honeybees

Mace Vaughan, co-director of the Pollinator Conservation Program at Xerces Society, told CNN he is ""definitely disappointed"" that the federal government isn't making a long-term commitment to understanding what is happening with bee colonies.

""We need some sort of thermometer to be able to determine, at a big scale, are we actually helping to turn around hive loses, to turn around pollinator declines,"" Vaughan said. ""Understanding what's going on with honeybees is incredibly important to having a sense of what's impacting pollinators in general.""

He added that the loss of the USDA survey means there is ""no redundancy"" in the system.

Dennis vanEngelsdorp, an entomologist who studies bee health at the University of Maryland, explained the important role honeybees play in agriculture, adding that it's important to have a ""finger on the pulse"" to better understand the trends in bee health.

""The value of all these surveys is its continuous use over time so you can compare trend lines,"" he said.

The most recently available data shows that beehive loss reached its highest winter levels this past year, according to the Bee Informed Partnership's most recent report.

Kelvin Adee, president of the American Honey Producers Association, said he's hopeful that the pause in data collection is temporary and that he understands USDA's budget constraints. But he said he hopes the USDA returns to collecting this data in the future.

""We definitely hope that they pick it back up again and have that information available. If it's not, then that's going to become a concern to us,"" he said. ""Where are we going to get that data that can be depended on?"""
Melania Trump honored with odd statue likened to a 'scarecrow' in her Slovenian home town,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Lukas Mikelionis', 'Lukas Mikelionis Is A Reporter For Foxnews.Com']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/melania-trump-slovenian-hometown-sevnica-statue,"First Lady Melania Trump’s Slovenian home town is paying a tribute to her as a “Slovenian hero” with a wood-carved statue that has raised some eyebrows, with some decrying it as a “scarecrow.”

The life-size statue was officially unveiled on Friday on the outskirts of Sevnica. It was first envisioned by Brad Downey, a 39-year-old American artist.

BETTE MIDLER BLASTS MELANIA TRUMP IN POEM FOLLOWING TWITTER CLASH WITH PRESIDENT

Downey, who told AFP that it’s the first monument dedicated to the First Lady in the world, commissioned a local artist to carve a tree using a chainsaw and shows the wife of President Trump in a blue dress raising her left hand in a waving motion.

But the sculpture has attracted some detractors who say it looks more like a “scarecrow” than a true representation of the First Lady.

“I can understand why people might think that this falls short as a description of her physical appearance,” Downey told AFP, but said the statue was “absolutely beautiful.”

WIDELY MOCKED CRISTIANO RONALDO BUST REPLACED AT PORTUGAL AIRPORT

The town of Sevnica has become an overnight tourist attraction following Trump’s election into office in 2016, with some journalists looking for insight into the first lady.

The town welcomed the opportunity to cater to the tourists, reportedly offering a series of Melania Trump-branded food and other items.

The actual sculptor is Ales Zupevc, a local artist also known as Maxi. Downey told the AFP that conversations with the artist helped him to see Trump’s ancestral town through local eyes.

“You see this river that she would have seen as a child, you see the mountains,” he told the outlet.

Yet the statue’s style was mocked by others in the country, with some unsure whether it was meant to be a parody or a serious attempt at honoring the first lady.

“If the monument was meant to be a parody, then the artist has been successful,” Nika, an architecture student told AFP. “We in Sevnica can only laugh and, at the same time, hold our heads in our hands over their [the Trumps’] catastrophic reputation.”"
"Susan Collins, a Fixture in Maine, Has Twin Troubles: Trump and Kavanaugh",https://www.nytimes.com,['Sheryl Gay Stolberg'],07-06-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/06/us/politics/susan-collins-election.html,"EASTPORT, Me. — Senator Susan Collins jogged her way through the Fourth of July parade in this picturesque little port city, handing out American flag stickers to cheers and shouts of “Thank you!” But beneath the bonhomie, there were hints that the once untouchable Republican may be in trouble because of two men: Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh and President Trump.

A retired restaurant worker shouted at Ms. Collins on Thursday to “get those kids out of cages” — a reference to border detention centers — and later invoked her vote to confirm Justice Kavanaugh. An organic farmworker shouted “Kavanaugh!” as the senator ran past. A local shopkeeper has been sending Ms. Collins letters urging her to live up to the example of Margaret Chase Smith, the iconic Republican senator from Maine who stood up to Joe McCarthy.

All three voted for Ms. Collins in 2014, persuaded by her reputation as a true moderate. “I want to vote for her again,” said the shopkeeper, Linda Cross Godfrey, 72. “It will be up to her whether I do or not.”

Ms. Collins, who coasted to a fourth term in 2014 with 68 percent of the vote, will be difficult to beat. But the polarization that has swept the nation is seeping into Maine as well, even here in the Collins-friendly part of the state known as Down East, where the nationalization of politics should seem far away. That has raised an important question: Can a cautious politician like Ms. Collins — at 66, the sole remaining New England Republican in Congress — survive in the loud and angry era of #MeToo and Trumpism?"
Reluctant witnesses in FISA abuse probe agree to talk to DOJ inspector general,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Catherine Herridge', 'Catherine Herridge Is An Award-Winning Chief Intelligence Correspondent For Fox News Channel', 'Fnc', 'Based In Washington', 'D.C. She Covers Intelligence', 'The Justice Department', 'The Department Of Homeland Security.

Horowitz early in his investigation into alleged government surveillance abuse have come forward at the 11th hour, Fox News has learned.

Sources familiar with the matter said at least one witness outside the Justice Department and FBI started cooperating -- a breakthrough that came after Attorney General William Barr ordered U.S. Attorney John Durham to lead a separate investigation into the origins of the bureau’s 2016 Russia case that laid the foundation for Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s probe.

While the investigative phase of the inspector general’s long-running probe is said to be complete, the sources said recent developments required some witnesses to be reinterviewed. And while Barr testified that he expected the report into alleged Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) abuse to be ready in May or last month, multiple sources said the timeline has slipped.

""The wheels of inspector general investigations move very, very slowly,"" former senior DOJ official Tom Dupree told Fox News.

Dupree, who served as deputy assistant attorney general from 2007 to 2009, does not have firsthand knowledge of the current IG case but is familiar with the process. He added, ""Like any investigation, you talk to one person, something that person tells you sends you back … to the first person, so it can be a very extensive, exhaustive process, because you are constantly picking up leads, interviewing former sources and navigating complex questions of classified information.""

Late-breaking information is known to delay such investigations. Horowitz’s office similarly encountered new evidence late in the process of the IG review into law enforcement decisions during the 2016 Hillary Clinton email investigation. In this case, additional FISA information came to light late in the process – including October 2016 contact (first reported by The Hill and confirmed by Fox News) between a senior State Department official and a former British spy Christopher Steele, who authored the infamous and salacious anti-Trump dossier.

The State Department contact with Steele was relayed to a senior FBI official. The timeline matters because about two weeks later, the FBI and DOJ used Steele's unverified research, paid for by the DNC and Clinton campaign, to secure a surveillance warrant against former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page. At the very least, it's been argued, Steele's contact with another government agency should have been a red flag for the FBI because it may have violated his confidential human source agreement.

Steele was later fired by the FBI over his media contacts before the 2016 presidential election. The Page surveillance warrant is the central issue of the DOJ IG’s review.

With the timeline for Horowitz’s report not public, one of the wild cards is the final review by the FBI and DOJ, which includes classification issues and could take weeks.

A spokesman for Horowitz would not comment on the report's status. But during largely unrelated testimony in November, Horowitz offered some guidance for the timeline of the FISA abuse probe in response to questions from GOP Rep. Jim Jordan.

""What I can say is given the volume of documents we've had and the number of witnesses it looks like we'll need to interview, we are likely to be in the same sort of general range of documents and witnesses as the last report,"" Horowitz said, referring to his team's review of the Clinton email case. ""It wouldn't surprise me if we are in that million or so plus range of documents and a hundred-ish or so interviews. The last review, as you know, took us about … 16 months or so.""

If that same guidance holds, the window for completion would begin this month, though it remains unclear how much the DOJ/FBI review and the additional interviews could delay the process."

US State Department mocked for warning citizens away from...Irish music festival,https://www.rt.com,[],,,,https://www.rt.com/news/463531-us-warning-irish-festival/,"The US State Department has warned American citizens of ‘a potential for violence’ at a music festival in Ireland. Locals mocked the state department’s paranoia, and the Irish police insist there’s nothing to worry about.

The world can be a dangerous place and the US State Department often warns its citizens to avoid travel to defined hotspots. This weekend alone the department issued warnings concerning planned suicide bombings in Afghanistan, arson in Haiti, demonstrations in Mali, and a suburban music festival in Dublin, Ireland.

One of these events is not like the others, yet the state department warned its citizens in Ireland of “a potential for violence” at the Longitude festival, which runs until Sunday in Dublin’s leafy Marlay Park. “Be aware of your surroundings and exercise caution if in the area,” it tweeted on Friday.

The tweet did not mention its sources, but was published shortly after a similar message from the US embassy in Dublin, which warned Americans to avoid the festival altogether, monitor local media for updates, and “notify family and friends of your safety.”

The Irish were quick to mock the State Department. “Violence?,” one tweeted. “Are ICE agents doing security or something?”“Ah lads, this is Ireland, the only report to be worried about is the weather report this weekend,” another added.

“There could be a bit of banter over a few pints,” one said. “There is however no chance of an armed gunman using a semi automatic weapon fire on festival goers.”

The Irish police (Gardaí) posted pictures of officers mingling with the crowd on Friday. “Nothing to see here folks except good fun, good music and above all a very enjoyable evening,” the force tweeted. By Saturday afternoon, “no incidents of note” had been reported.

The Justice Department Hasn’t Found a New Reason for the Census Citizenship Question—but Trump Has,https://slate.com,['Mark Joseph Stern'],07-05-2019,2019,7,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/07/justice-department-census-citizenship-question-trump.html,"President Donald Trump boards Air Force One before departing from Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland on Friday. Mandel Ngan/Getty Images

The Department of Justice revealed on Friday that it’s still searching for a new justification for a census citizenship question that might pass legal muster. And while it rummages around for that rationale, the DOJ asked a federal judge to delay discovery into the allegedly discriminatory motives that produced the citizenship question, a request he promptly denied. Meanwhile, Donald Trump revealed his actual reason for wanting a citizenship question on the census—and it contradicts statements his own solicitor general made to the Supreme Court.

Welcome to the ongoing clown show of census 2020.

Friday’s DOJ filing was expected to provide a new reason for the citizenship question, after SCOTUS ruled that its previous rationale was bogus. (Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross, who oversees the census, said the question was necessary to better enforce the Voting Rights Act, a claim that does not make sense and is contradicted by the record.) Trump ordered administration officials to devise this new pretext just one day after they told a court they had dropped their quest for the citizenship question.

That about-face created difficulties in the ongoing case before U.S. District Judge George Hazel. The Supreme Court blocked the citizenship question because it was illegally supported by pure pretext, not because it was discriminatory. In June, however, plaintiffs uncovered new evidence that seemed to indicate the purpose of the question was to diminish Hispanics’ voting power. In light of these materials, Hazel reopened discovery in the case to let plaintiffs pursue their equal protection claim, a decision affirmed by the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.

Had the Trump administration simply dropped the citizenship question, this case would be moot. But Trump has refused to give up on the question, so this case should, in theory, move forward, with discovery commencing as soon as possible.

On Friday, though, DOJ attorneys asked Hazel to pause discovery while they develop a different justification for the citizenship question. They argued that, by “providing a new rationale,” they will have magically cleansed the question of any discriminatory intent. For support, they cited Trump v. Hawaii, in which the Supreme Court held that any prejudiced motives undergirding Trump’s initial travel ban had been washed away by its third iteration. The DOJ, in other words, believes that Trump v. Hawaii prohibits courts from examining illegal motives behind the original citizenship question once it issues a new rationale for that question.

None of these shenanigans will please Chief Justice John Roberts.

Hazel did not agree, rejecting the DOJ’s request on Friday in an order allowing discovery to move forward. And for good reason.* It would be much more difficult to engage in animus-laundering here, where the administration’s first justification for the citizenship question has already been shot down. Trump officials are now openly contriving a new rationale, beginning with their conclusion and working backward to find some pretext that SCOTUS might accept. The administration must uproot the entire legal structure upon which the citizenship question stands—unlike in the travel ban case, where the stated purpose (national security) was always the same. Any animus attached to rationale No. 1 will surely taint rationale No. 2 when both are fruit of the same poisonous tree.

It is also pretty shocking to see the DOJ take its time in crafting a new pretext when it repeatedly told the Supreme Court that it had to finalize the census forms by June 30. The administration used this deadline to leapfrog over the court of appeals and get a swift Supreme Court ruling. Now that urgency has vanished, creating the inescapable impression that the DOJ lied to SCOTUS about its alleged timeline in a game of chicken that it unexpectedly lost. (The government is already printing census forms without a citizenship question, so any alteration at this late date will cost a huge sum of money.)

Finally, the Justice Department is not being helped by Trump, who acknowledged on Friday that the “number one” reason for a citizenship question is “for districting.” Presumably, Trump means that he wants to let states draw districts by counting only citizens of voting age, not all persons—a scheme that would dramatically boost white voting power. (It has been neither permitted or prohibited by SCOTUS.) That’s a troubling concession, because Solicitor General Noel Francisco told the Supreme Court that using citizenship data for redistricting was not the purpose of the census citizenship question. Once again, Trump is telling a very different story from the narrative carefully crafted by DOJ attorneys.

None of these shenanigans will please Chief Justice John Roberts, who wrote the opinion blocking the citizenship question on the first go-round. With every reversal and misrepresentation, the Trump administration is making it more difficult for Roberts to uphold the question under a new rationale. The DOJ will eventually contrive a new pretext that will likely get laughed out of court. It is destroying its own credibility to pursue what has become a feeble and humiliating vanity project for the president.

Update, July 5, 2019, at 3:48 p.m.: This article has been updated to note that Hazel allowed discovery to move forward."
"If AOC really thinks Trump is a ‘fascist,’ why does she want to make the government so much more powerful?",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-05-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/if-aoc-really-thinks-trump-is-a-fascist-why-does-she-want-to-make-the-government-so-much-more-powerful,"Jobs are up, wages are rising, and President Trump gave a nonpartisan, patriotic speech at Washington, D.C.’s Fourth of July celebration.

Oh, and if you haven’t noticed, we’re also on the brink of fascism. Or something.

That’s the latest hysterical claim from Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. She said in an interview this week with Yahoo News that the U.S. is on the brink of collapse into the extinct authoritarian ideology of the late Benito Mussolini.

Are we headed to fascism? Yes. I don’t think there’s a question. If you actually take the time to study, and to look at the steps, and to see how government transforms under authoritarian regimes, and look at the political decisions and patterns of this president, the answer is yes.

Bizarrely, an opinion writer at the New York Times gave credence to this ludicrous claim, arguing that the Trump administration “draws on fascist ideology in its rhetoric” and that Trump “echoes the very aspects of American history that Hitler praised.” Meanwhile, liberal law professor Laurence Tribe received almost 10,000 likes for a tweet comparing Trump’s Fourth of July celebration to Chinese authoritarianism.

The resemblance to days before Tiananmen Square is chilling. https://t.co/cFJJZzL4F7 — Laurence Tribe (@tribelaw) July 2, 2019

For those who don’t know, fascism has, in practice, involved state violence and authoritarianism, as well as rigid, undemocratic state control of an entire country's economy and civil society. It has also often invoked nationalism, xenophobia, and jingoism.

Any reasonable person realizes this is a far cry from the present-day United States. Even Trump's worst tendencies, which don't amount to fascism, have routinely been thwarted by courts, advisers, and elections.

Yet, even assuming the contrary, it’s clear that the New York Democratic congresswoman's cries of fascism are hysterical and unserious. If she were really worried the U.S. was sliding toward fascism, she wouldn’t be trying to make the executive branch so much more powerful than it already is.

After all, that’s exactly what Ocasio-Cortez’s agenda would do.

Her ""Medicare for all"" healthcare platform, for example, involves the federal government taking over the entire business of healthcare, dumping hundreds of millions of people off private insurance and onto government rolls. This essentially means giving the government discretionary power over who gets healthcare and of what sort — not the kind of authority you would give Trump if you really thought him a dictator.

More broadly, Ocasio-Cortez’s Green New Deal would cost up to $93 trillion in government spending over a decade. Funding this would require massive increases in taxation and increased government involvement in the economy. The current size of the economy is about $20 trillion annually, and so under Ocasio-Cortez’s proposal, the government would be controlling more than half the economy. Unsurprisingly, Cato Institute scholar Ryan Bourne called her platform a “green-painted Trojan horse” that is “filled with the biggest single government expansion the United States has seen since the 1930s.” That gives a would-be fascist president a lot of power.

Fundamentally, this doesn’t make sense. Surely Ocasio-Cortez knows that Democrats will not win every election, and as the old adage goes, a government big enough to give you everything you want is big enough to take from you everything you have.

So no, the facts on the ground don’t support Ocasio-Cortez’s claims that Trump is taking the U.S. toward fascism, and neither does her own rhetoric and advocacy. Anyone actually concerned about growing concentration of power would advocate for decentralization, localism, and constitutionally limited government. Thus, Ocasio-Cortez’s cries of “fascism” are remarkably disingenuous."

Michael Morell was the deputy director of the CIA from 2010 to 2013 and twice its acting director. He is a contributing columnist for The Post.

From his very first day in office, President Trump has had a strange and, at times, strained relationship with the U.S. intelligence community. The president and his political aides have often challenged the honesty and integrity of the community, damaging morale, undercutting its mission and making the already difficult challenge of uncovering threats to our nation even harder.

But, by putting the CIA’s analytic judgment (that one of Russia’s objectives in interfering in the 2016 election was to help then-candidate Trump) into the crosshairs of the Justice Department, as reported by several news organizations , the president and Attorney General William P. Barr are crossing another line.

I see no problem with a Justice Department review of whether the CIA and other intelligence agencies lived up to their legal and regulatory responsibilities as to how they handled any information related to U.S. persons — U.S. citizens and U.S. nationals. There are strict rules in this regard — the most important promulgated by multiple attorneys general over time — and, in our divisive political environment, it would be beneficial to our democracy for the country to know whether the rules were followed or not.

Nor am I arguing that CIA analytic judgments should be beyond review, but that has already happened in this case. Both the Senate and the House intelligence committees have done reviews of the analysis, with the bipartisan Senate committee calling the overall analysis a “sound intelligence product.” The partisan House committee split on the question of the specific judgment about Russian President Vladi­mir Putin’s intent to help Trump.

What I am arguing is that the Justice Department has no standing to review the CIA’s analytic judgment. The whole idea is inappropriate and dangerous. It is certainly unprecedented, and there are good reasons it has never been done before.

I have great respect for John H. Durham , the U.S. attorney for the District of Connecticut tapped by Barr to do the review. But, while Durham is familiar with the CIA from previous investigations, he and his team have no experience with, or knowledge of, the process of intelligence analysis itself. He and his team could well impose a hard-to-meet law enforcement standard on the analysts’ conclusions. That would create a burden of proof that might be right in a court of law but would be risky and unwise in the assessment of intelligence for real-time decision-making.

A similarly dangerous consequence of a Justice Department review of analysis is the chilling effect it may have on analysts and analysis. Out of prudence, any analyst asked to submit to an interview with Durham’s investigators will want to have a personal lawyer nearby — likely a first for many, if not all, of the analysts. This will all be watched closely inside the intelligence community: The prospect that Justice Department prosecutors could ask questions about how an analyst came to a specific conclusion — along with the thought that there may be legal consequences for having done so — could lead analysts to withhold their judgments or even decide that this profession is not for them. We lose as a nation with either outcome.

If the shoe were on the other foot — if a senior intelligence community official were asked to review decisions made by the FBI and career prosecutors — how do we think the attorney general, or career prosecutors, would react? With loud protests, no doubt.

There seems to be an erroneous belief among some that if the analysts had not come to the conclusion that Putin was trying to help Trump, there would not have been an FBI counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign. This belief is misplaced; there was likely never a link between a judgment by the intelligence community analysts and a decision by the FBI on whether to open a counterintelligence case. The two were most likely completely separate. And, further, it seems that the analytic judgment about Russian intent came after the opening of the counterintelligence investigation. If so, it could not have been a predicate for the investigation.

A Justice-led review of the quality of intelligence analysis represents yet another weakening of the intelligence community as an institution. The country could be paying for these kinds of decisions for years to come."
Trump's not-so-secret war on state environmental protection,https://thehill.com,[],07-06-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/opinion/energy-environment/451811-trumps-not-so-secret-war-on-state-environmental-protection,"Trump’s EPA claims to support “cooperative federalism,” as a way to “rebalance the power between Washington and the states.” But its actual agenda appears to be halting the wave of bold environmental protections emerging from American cities and states. To that end, the EPA now seeks to limit states’ authority to protect our climate, while threatening budget cuts of nearly $1.4 billion in state environmental funding.

If this effort succeeds, our towns and cities will face dirtier air, hotter summers and more extreme weather — and there will be less we can do about it.

A centerpiece of EPA’s attack on climate protection is its proposal to freeze car emission standards at 2020 levels, which would increase greenhouse gas emissions by 1.7 billion metric tons. EPA also seeks to limit state power by revoking a waiver under the Clean Air Act that allows California and a dozen states that follow its lead to set their own more stringent standards.

State authority to protect air quality has existed in one form or another for half a century. EPA has granted 50 waivers, but has never revoked one. So, it is hard to imagine a more brazen attack on state authority than rescinding this waiver, which was granted five years ago. In effect, Trump’s EPA is forcibly enlisting states in the administration’s war on climate protection.

Another recent salvo in that war is new guidance that would limit state authority over energy pipelines. Under the Clean Water Act, a pipeline cannot be constructed unless the state certifies that it will not cause violations of any “appropriate requirement of state law.” But the new guidance would let the federal government and energy companies run roughshod over state laws aimed at reducing air emissions and addressing climate change.

Along with shrinking state power, EPA’s conception of “cooperative federalism” also means shrinking state funding, with a proposed budget that cuts support for state environmental protection by $1.4 billion.

This includes crippling cuts of $500 million in support for state environmental programs, which depend on EPA for more than a quarter of their operating budgets. The biggest cuts, $300 million, are to programs for clean and safe water, with the remaining $200 million directed at programs that protect air quality and manage hazardous waste, pesticides and toxics. These cuts would starve states of vital resources needed to carry out their role as EPA’s partners in administering our nation’s environmental laws and responding to emergencies like hurricanes, floods and severe storms.

The budget also proposes $43 million in cuts to brownfields programs that are key to redeveloping our nation’s cities. Brownfields are contaminated or polluted sites, often in the heart of America’s downtowns and former economic centers. By cleaning and repurposing these sites, cities can improve the quality of urban life and increase property values.

EPA calculates that approximately 129 million people (roughly 40 percent of the U.S. population) live within three miles of a brownfield site that receives EPA funding. As of November 2018, grants awarded by the program have reclaimed 77,000 acres of idle land for productive use, with over 141,300 jobs created and $26.8 billion leveraged.

The EPA’s proposed budget would also slash more than $140 million from federal support for state and interstate programs to protect and restore nationally significant water bodies like the Chesapeake Bay, Puget Sound, Long Island Sound and Lake Champlain. America’s surface waters are an important source of drinking water for our nation’s communities.

But the biggest cuts, a whopping $874 million, are to a pair of highly successful state revolving loan funds that have tremendously improved our nation’s water infrastructure by ensuring adequate sanitation and treatment for the water our communities depend on.

These funds are needed now more than ever. Just ask the people of Martin County, Kentucky; Salem, Oregon; Toledo, Ohio; and Flint, Michigan — who had to stop using their contaminated tap water.

They are not alone: More than 27 million Americans are served by community water systems that do not fully meet health-based drinking water standards. Every year our nation suffers a quarter of a million water main breaks, with sewer overflows that discharge billions of gallons of raw sewage into local surface waters. At the same time, some $660 billion will be needed to repair the country’s aging water infrastructure over the next 20 years.

The good news is that cities and states are fighting back. Earlier this year, the House passed a budget that rejected all of the proposed cuts, and the Senate seems likely to follow suit. States are already preparing to challenge the regulatory cutbacks in court. As for water quality certification, the strong language of the Clean Water Act recognizing state authority likely means that any new EPA steps to undercut that authority will be rejected by the courts.

For Trump’s EPA, “cooperative federalism” means that states cooperate while the federal government kneecaps state-level efforts to protect people and the environment. And this is from an administration that ostensibly supports states’ rights. It’s chilling to wonder how far EPA might go if it wanted to weaken the role of the states. Let’s hope we never find out.

"After nearly two years, State Dept. responds to inquiry over alleged alcohol poisonings of US tourists",https://www.cnn.com,"['Michelle Kosinski', 'Zachary Cohen']",07-03-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/03/politics/state-department-tainted-alcohol-mexico/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Nearly two years after receiving an inquiry from Senate Homeland Security Committee chairman Ron Johnson, the State Department is finally revealing details about its investigation into multiple deaths and illnesses that occurred shortly after Americans drank alcohol at Mexican resorts , CNN has learned.

The response, obtained by CNN, said that two bars were ultimately shut down by Mexican authorities after the State Department pressured them to inspect a number of establishments.

It was sent to Johnson, a Wisconsin Republican, last month by the State Department's Office of Inspector General. Johnson first wrote to enquire about the cases involving allegations of tainted alcohol in October 2017.

The timing of the OIG's response coincides with a more recent string of mysterious tourist deaths in the Dominican Republic

In several of those cases, families have alleged that the victims became ill just after consuming alcohol, leading the FBI to look into whether tainted alcohol might be a factor there as well.

While there is no indication of a link between the incidents that occurred in Mexico and the more recent cases in the Dominican Republic, the response to Johnson's 2017 letter highlights several concerns related to the US government's handling of inquires involving American tourists abroad.

Johnson sent his letter to the State Department just months after the death of a 20-year-old woman from Wisconsin named Abbey Conner in January 2017.

She and her brother Austin lost consciousness soon after consuming alcohol at the pool bar in the Iberostar Paraiso del Mar on the first day of their family's vacation. Abbey was found face-down in the shallow end of the pool, nearly drowned, and died days later after being airlifted to a hospital in Florida.

""According to Ms. Connor's family, and other victims who have since come forward, the consumption of allegedly tainted alcohol at Mexican resorts has led to violence, physical abuse and even death,"" Johnson's letter to the State Department states. ""I respectfully ask the Office of the Inspector General to examine how the Department monitors, records and reports overseas incidents involving physical abuse or death after the consumption of potentially tainted alcohol.""

'Formal report would not be appropriate'

Despite prompting a wide-ranging probe into the issue, which included reviewing every complaint made to the State Department about possible bootleg alcohol, interviewing the people involved and significant coordination with the Mexican government, the Inspector General ultimately concluded that a ""formal report would not be appropriate.""

The response explains, ""OIG faced several challenges in completing this review, including the fact that victims often did not report incidents of unregulated alcohol to the department, which significantly limited the number of cases on which OIG could base any generalizable findings,"" it states.

""In addition, OIG's review was complicated by the fact that the guidance for consular personnel who face these types of situations is general and sometimes advisory, mainly because of the complex and variable nature of the incidents themselves.""

However, the lengthy response does detail the inner workings of how this inquiry was handled as a result of pressure on the State Department, and details some of the actions that were taken as a result of the review.

Ultimately, the State Department's Bureau of Consular Affairs did provide OIG with a list of 15 complaints that it has received since 2017 related to the consumption of unregulated alcohol by Americans in the Mexican state of Quintana Roo, the most visited by tourists from the US.

Two bars shut down

The State Department pressured the Mexican government to inspect 30 bars, restaurants and hotels. Two bars -- including one that served Abbey and Austin Conner -- have been shut down as a result. Raids were conducted by Mexican authorities that did end up finding ""a significant amount of alcohol of 'undetermined origin'"" and led to the identification of one supplier of questionably-sourced alcohol.

Ten thousand gallons of this alcohol was seized -- although according to the OIG, none tested positive for any dangerous substances.

And the State Department's work led to the Mexican government opening an office staffed with bilingual attorneys to help American tourists file police reports.

The response makes no mention, however, of multiple incidents reported in various media outlets that Mexican officials had, in other raids, seized hundreds of gallons of alcohol allegedly tainted with methanol, a toxic form of alcohol that is used in fuel, antifreeze, windshield wiper fluid and solvents. It can cause blindness and death.

Those findings are included in the Conner family's wrongful death lawsuit against Iberostar, filed last year.

The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, which has reported extensively on the Mexican cases, reports that it has heard from more than 200 people who believe they encountered tainted alcohol in Mexico, and the paper cites a 2017 Mexican government-spearheaded study that found that as much as 36% of all alcohol consumed throughout Mexico is produced illegally and unregulated.

The OIG's response did detail some of the difficulties American families of victims faced in getting help from the State Department while in Mexico, which some families described as ""insensitive,"" ""bureaucratic,"" or virtually nonexistent. At times families were told by State officials that they could not help them navigate the Mexican law enforcement or healthcare process.

The family of one woman who died was told the State Department couldn't help them at all submitting a police report when the Mexican government refused to let them file one.

In one case, a man had to wait until the next day for assistance filing a police report, despite reporting he was drugged and sexually assaulted after drinking tainted alcohol.

Yet despite recording the summaries of various reported cases, OIG did not express an opinion as to whether extensive handling of alleged cases of tainted alcohol in Mexico falls under the State Department's area of responsibility.

""OIG cannot draw definitive conclusions about any individual consular officer's compliance with Department policies in these cases,"" their response to Johnson's letter says, since State Department guidance on this issue remains vague.

An official with the inspector general's office told CNN their investigation is now closed.

""We were really limited by our jurisdiction, in what we could look at,"" the official said. ""We mostly had to focus on the actions of the State Department. And it did put a lot of pressure on the Mexican government to do thorough inspections.""

The official said the Mexican government was receptive to the US's urgings to do something about‎ the problem, but added, ""Mexico doesn't want to lose tourist dollars. It's a huge source of revenue.""

Gary Davidson, an attorney for the family of Abbey Conner, continues to seek answers and compensation for the family's loss. ""There is basically homemade liquor down there, circulating in the community of hotels -- and a lot of the hotels are buying it,"" he told CNN."

"Obama DHS chief blasts Dems’ ‘open borders’ push, warns migration would explode",https://www.foxnews.com,['Adam Shaw'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/obama-dhs-chief-blasts-dems-open-borders-push-warns-migration-would-explode,"An Obama-era Department of Homeland Security chief is warning Democratic presidential candidates to cool their push to decriminalize illegal border crossings, saying such a move would be tantamount to “open borders” policy and lead to hundreds of thousands more people flooding into the U.S. every month.

“That is tantamount to declaring publicly that we have open borders,” Jeh Johnson told The Washington Post.

DHS ACTING CHIEF PREDICTS UP TO 25 PERCENT DROP IN BORDER CROSSINGS AFTER NEW MEXICO AGREEMENT

“That is unworkable, unwise and does not have the support of a majority of American people or the Congress, and if we had such a policy, instead of 100,000 apprehensions a month, it will be multiples of that,” he said.

In May, authorities apprehended or encountered more than 144,000 border crossers, representing a stunning increase over the past several months. Current acting DHS Secretary Kevin McAleenan said Friday that he anticipates the numbers decreased in June, amid new efforts to crack down both at the U.S.-Mexico border and Mexico's border with Central America.

Johnson’s warning that any gains could be reversed comes as 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls have lurched to the left on immigration, calling for health care for illegal immigrants and scrapping certain immigration enforcement measures.

At a Thursday night primary debate in Miami, candidates making up about half the field were asked if they support making crossing the border a civil, rather than a criminal, offense. Almost all the candidates, including former Obama Vice President Joe Biden, raised their hands.

The moment demonstrated how a once-fringe policy, pushed earlier this year by former Housing Secretary Julian Castro, has become mainstream among Democrats. Just days before the debate, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., came out in favor of such a proposal.

OBAMA'S IMMIGRATION CHIEFS SPEAK OUT ON 'CRISIS' AT SOUTHERN BORDER

However, Castro on Thursday denied he supported open borders.

“Open borders is just a right-wing talking point,” he said. “It doesn’t matter what Democrats do on immigration.”

Since then Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J. announced on Tuesday a plan to “virtually eliminate immigration detention.”

“Without waiting for Congress to act, Cory will stop the treatment of immigrants as criminals, close inhumane DHS facilities, end the use of for-profit detention facilities and end unnecessary barriers for refugees and those seeking asylum to virtually eliminate immigrant detention,” a press release said.

Johnson, meanwhile, has also pushed back on the controversy surrounding the Trump administration's use of detention centers for migrants. On Friday, he said that chain link fences or ""cages"" weren't ideal, but were one of the ways authorities are forced to cope with the surge of migrants crossing the border, and that the alternative was putting them ""on the streets.""

""Chain link barriers, partitions, fences, cages -- whatever you want to call them -- were not invented on January 2017,"" Johnson said.

The Justice Department in Washington in May 2013. (J. David Ake/AP)

Contributing columnist

Pity the poor Justice Department lawyer who draws the short straw these days.

On Wednesday, only 24 hours after assuring a federal district judge that the government would not try to add to the 2020 Census the citizenship question the Supreme Court had blocked, the department suddenly reversed ground.

That left it to a sheepish and bewildered career Justice Department lawyer, Joshua Gardner, to tell Judge George M. Hazel of the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland that he was backing away from firm representations he had made to the court on behalf of the federal government just a day earlier.

The sole provocation for this humiliating situation: a tweet from President Trump on Wednesday morning asserting “we are absolutely moving forward” on the citizenship question,” notwithstanding the Supreme Court’s decision.

You read that right: a tweet. Nothing more.

Gardner had no choice but to inform the court, “The tweet this morning was the first I had heard of the president’s position on this issue. . . . As you can imagine, I am doing my absolute best to figure out what’s going on.""

And, in short order, Gardner found himself backpedaling and doing his best to defend his own credibility, pleading to the court that, “I’ve been with the United States Department of Justice for 16 years through multiple administrations, and I’ve always endeavored to be as candid as possible with the court.""

Translation: I’m a career employee and not a Trump toady; I recognize that the department looks lawless and untrustworthy right now, but please try not to hold it too much against us going forward.

Career Justice Department lawyers are used to working in anonymity and with the winds of their credibility and that of the department as a whole at their backs. This is very far from the way Gardner would like to have seen his name in the national news.

Likewise for Sarah Fabian, the career lawyer forced to the front lines to draw the fire of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit — and public humiliation — for defending the proposition that denying immigrants soap and toothbrushes complies with the statutory mandate of “sanitary” detention facilities.

The fault here — beyond the obvious erratic lurching of the president and his l’etat-c’est-moi disregard of the rule of law — rests with Justice Department leadership.

Administrations change positions. That is understood and legitimate. But they do it with care, circumspection and due regard for the need to respect the law as objective and continuous, and for their duty of candor to the courts.

So the true eyebrow-raising feature of the department’s abrupt U-turn on the census is its absence of deliberation. The assistant attorney general for the civil division, Jody Hunt, who joined the conference before the court, conceded that the tweet was the sole impetus for the reversal.

That demonstrates an undue, if not ridiculous, solicitude for the whims of the mad king. The indication that Trump wanted to find a way around the ruling of the Supreme Court should have been (at most) a trigger for a reasoned process involving department leadership — in particular, the solicitor general, the client (in this case, the Commerce Department) and, perhaps, the White House counsel.

And voices within those discussions needed to be ready push back against political caprice, or measure it against the government’s longer-term responsibility to safeguard its credibility with the court and display fidelity to the rule of law. That is ultimately a service to the president, as well as to the department and the courts.

Yes, time is very short, but there is no indication of any such process having taken place here. Trump tweets; the department disposes.

The backwards somersault was all the more ill-considered given the severe credibility problems that the department and administration have created in this very case. The Supreme Court’s decision took the very unusual step of essentially rejecting as pretextual the proffered reason for including the citizenship question. Even before that, Hazel had taken the unusual step of reopening the case based on new evidence suggesting that the true reason for the question was to increase the political power of Republicans and non-Hispanic whites.

Finally, the solicitor general had made repeated representations to the Supreme Court that June 30 was a drop-dead date after which the census question could not be added. Now that the administration seems to believe otherwise, it leaves him with egg on his face.

The department seems relatively indifferent to the institutional cost of defending the imperial presidency, including the potential erosion in public confidence that the government is constrained by law. But this latest episode is a new indication that the federal courts at least are taking notice. The 9th Circuit on Wednesday handed the administration its latest setback, rejecting its request to stay a District Court ruling blocking the diversion of military funds to pay for Trump’s border wall.

If the department continues to jump at the president’s every hiccup — candor and consistency be damned — it may find that the courts are more likely to deny it the traditional benefit of the doubt and reject its litigating positions. That is more than an embarrassment for the front-line lawyers; it is a body blow to the department’s institutional interests and, potentially, the public’s confidence in a government of laws, not of men.

"Lots of DoD Small Launchers, But What Will They Launch?",https://breakingdefense.com,"['Theresa Hitchens', 'Arie Egozi', 'Sydney J. Freedberg Jr.', 'Leonardo Drs', 'Breaking Defense']",,,,https://breakingdefense.com/2019/07/lots-of-dod-small-launchers-but-what-will-they-launch/,"WASHINGTON: Small satellite launcher projects are all the rage at DoD, but there aren’t many actual small satellites for them to launch. While there are numerous experimental satellites being designed and flown, there is no officially funded program aimed at designing, building and using smallsats for DoD missions.

“I think there’s been a long chicken and egg problem between small launch and small satellites” says Steve Nixon, president of the aptly-named SmallSat Alliance. “The traditional way is to attack them at the same time: do a little bit of both consecutively. We would like to see the national security side move out more aggressively, because there is lot of agreement about the value of small satellites.”

Indeed, part of the mission of the SmallSat Alliance, formed last year, is to help DoD figure out how it can “go beyond just experiments and begin to use small satellites for true operations.”

A DoD official admitted this week that right now it would be impossible to name a “program of record” for small satellites within the military services.

Part of the problem is that Air Force leadership has sent mixed signals on the level of interest in small satellites. The Air Force accounts for about 90 percent of DoD space spending.

Former Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson waxed decidedly noncommittal in a speech at the annual Space Symposium in April. Wilson said that an internal Pentagon study on future space architectures found that “exquisite satellites” (that is, large, expensive, and highly capable) are still a key DoD focus. (That study has not been released publicly.)

Air Force Space Command Vice Commander Lt. Gen. David Thompson, however, told a New America conference here in May that the Air Force will “definitely be using” large constellations of small satellites.

“The external and internal communication regarding [DoD] smallsat strategy is not consistent and not clear,” Carissa Christensen, CEO of Bryce Space and Technologies, said somewhat wryly in a Tuesday interview.

Experiments Everywhere

At the same time, practically every space-related body within DoD seems to be experimenting with small satellites based in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) — or in Pentagonese, “proliferated LEO.”

One of the flagship programs underway is the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency’s (DARPA) Blackjack program, designed to test small satellite constellations based on a Lego-like model of standardized bus designs with switchable payloads. While the Air Force has been planning to transition technology proven successful from Blackjack — called CASINO for Commercially Augmented Space Inter Networked Operations — to its own LEO-based constellation of smallsats, funding for that is uncertain.

The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) at Wright Patterson AFB long has developed smallsat-based experiments, such as the Demonstration and Science Experiments (DSX) spacecraft studying the affects of the Van Allen radiation belts on spacecraft components. The DSX was launched last week on SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy, along with 24 other small satellites under Air Force Space and Missile System Center’s (SMC) Space Test Program-2 mission.

The DoD Space Test Program (STP) has been around for decades, working to orbit Army, Navy and Air Force space experiments that are chosen by the DoD Space Experiments Review Board (SERB), chaired by the head of Air Force acquisition, Will Roper. SMC manages the STP program.

The Army, which has long been interested in the promise of small satellites for its tactical needs, has its own programs as well. The most recent effort is the Gunsmoke-L program started last year with a two-year (plus an option for a third), $8.3 million contract with Dynetics, based in Huntsville, Ala., to develop, test, integrate and demonstrate two “tactical space support vehicles.” The Army has built a series of the classified Gunsmoke satellites, dating back to at least 2017.

Further, my colleague Vivienne Machi last week broke the news that the Army is developing its first “tactical space layer” strategy that could include satellites in LEO for communications; position, navigation, and timing (PNT) and battle management command and control (BMC2) missions.

The Navy, in November 2018, launched its ICE-Cap (Integrated Communications Extension Capability) nansosatellite to demonstrate the ability of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites to expand the coverage of its Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) narrow-band communications satellite network to the polar regions.

But none of these test projects are slated to transition to formal programs, with formal budgets, and formal military missions.

Proliferating Launch Initiatives

Meanwhile, there is enormous industry buzz in the small launch vehicle market, including about the potential for DoD contracts.

Christensen said one of the reasons small launch vehicle vendors around the world are increasingly looking at governments as potential customers is that the commercial market is simply not going to be able to support all of them. Based on market history and future trends, she explained, not all the thousands of smallsats being proposed (or even already licensed) will actually be deployed; even some of the companies that manage to orbit some smallsats will fail; and once a company actually manages to become economically viable, the size of its satellites is likely to grow.

But rather than being concerned about the disconnect between DoD’s eagerness to on-ramp commercial launch capability and the lack of real DoD smallsat programs, Christensen believes DoD is doing the right thing by moving out to try to harness the capability for responsive launch. (Responsive launch, the ability to launch practically on demand, has been a Holy Grail for the Pentagon for more than a decade. See Operationally Responsive Space.)

“I really feel like this slight disconnect of market dynamics is creating a really good opportunity to take advantage of emergent systems and determine if they have applicability to future military of IC [Intelligence Community] needs, for much cheaper than starting from scratch and building internal DoD programs.”

There are at least three significant DoD programs seeking to validate smaller launchers for future military use.

STP is partnering with the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) on the Rapid Agile Launch Initiative (RALI). RALI is designed to leverage DIU’s expertise in open sourcing by rapidly awarding DoD launch service agreements with non-traditional, venture-class companies.

Last week, the truly non-traditional startup SpinLaunch announced it has become the latest winner of a DIU contract under that initiative. The contract (for an unspecified amount) is to prototype SpinLaunch’s ground-based, kinetic energy launch system that functions as a kind of centrifugal force catapult to heave a small rocket carrying a satellite out of the atmosphere.

A SpinLaunch fact sheet explains that the launch system uses “existing technology and components from oil/gas/mining and wind turbine industries to construct an innovative mass acceleration system, which achieves very high launch speeds without the need for enormous power generation or massive infrastructure. After ascending above the atmosphere, a relatively small, low-cost onboard rocket will be used to “provide the final required velocity for orbital insertion.”

The RALI program’s first launch was in May, when New Zealand startup Rocket Lab successfully lofted three small experimental satellites into LEO. It included the Army’s Harbinger, a commercial small satellite built by York Space Systems in Denver, to “demonstrate the ability of an experimental commercial system to meet DoD space capability requirements.”

DARPA’s Launch Challenge in April awarded $400,000 to each of three companies chosen to demonstrate “flexible and responsive” launch of small payloads. Tucson-based Vector Launch, Virgin Orbit, and a “stealth” startup now are competing for prizes up to $10 million for proving they can successfully launch twice in a row — from any launch facility chosen by DARPA — within a short timeframe. As a next step, the competitors early next year will be asked to launch a payload to LEO within two weeks from one of eight predetermined sites — after receiving notice of the launch site only a few weeks prior, and exact details on the payload and intended orbit just days before. One of the goals is to demonstrate that DoD can contract backup launches if one of its few fixed launch facilities is put out of commission by either an accident or an attack.

Todd Master, the program manager for the DARPA Launch Challenge, told me that DARPA is busy with preparatory work in the run up to the actual launch-off planned for early next year. This includes, he says, working with the Federal Aviation Authority to ensure that the commercial licensing process is smooth, given the “challenges” the project presents to the FAA’s normal launch licensing process. “They’ve been a great partner,” he said, adding that DARPA sees the Launch Challenge as “hopefully laying the ground work for streamlined licensing processes that could work in the future” to help DoD acquire commercial space launch capabilities.

And yet another new Air Force small launch effort, called the Rapid Space Launch Initiative (RSLI), was kicked off in late May by SMC’s Rocket Systems Launch Program based at Kirtland AFB in New Mexico. The RSLI request for proposals says that the Air Force is “investigating the possible procurement of a capability to rapidly launch and deploy space payloads critical to national security in an ultra-responsive manner. The objective is 24 hours from “call up” notification to on-orbit capability.”

That project seeks to demonstrate rapid space launch capabilities to LEO “on a small scale,” with “the intended payload” an “Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle Secondary Payload Adapter (ESPA) class space vehicle or smaller with a mass up to 220kg.” The RFI, however, notes that “demonstrated solutions that can scale to orbits and payloads of national security value are also of great interest. The program intends to hold an industry day in El Segundo, Calif., July 29-30."

House Democrats file lawsuit to obtain Trump tax returns,https://www.cnn.com,"['Lauren Fox', 'Katelyn Polantz', 'Clare Foran', 'Ellie Kaufman']",07-02-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/02/politics/tax-return-lawsuit/index.html,"(CNN) The Democrat-led House Ways and Means Committee filed a lawsuit on Tuesday to enforce subpoenas and obtain President Donald Trump's tax returns, an escalation in a fight for the President's personal financial information.

The lawsuit was filed in D.C. District Court against Treasury and the IRS and their respective leaders, Steve Mnuchin and Charles Rettig.

House Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal is seeking the President's tax returns using a little-known IRS provision known as 6103 , which allows the Chairmen of the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee to request and obtain an individual's tax information for a legitimate legislative purpose.

The move comes months after Neal made his initial request for the President's tax information and as outside groups and other liberals on the Ways and Means Committee grew impatient with the pace of Neal's efforts. Neal initially made his request for Trump's tax returns on April 3. After a series of follow-up letters, the Treasury Department formally denied the request at the beginning of May, and Neal issued subpoenas to the IRS and Treasury Department on May 10.

""In refusing to comply with the statute, Defendants have mounted an extraordinary attack on the authority of Congress to obtain information needed to conduct oversight of Treasury, the IRS, and the tax laws on behalf of the American people who participate in the Nation's voluntary tax system,"" House attorneys wrote in the complaint.

Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen not yet briefed on DOJ probe into origins of Russia probe,https://www.usatoday.com,"['Kevin Johnson', 'Published P.M. Et July']",07-05-2019,2019,7,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/07/05/deputy-ag-jeffrey-rosen-not-yet-briefed-doj-surveillance-probe/1655150001/,"CLOSE Attorney General William Barr told a network television interviewer that he wants answers on how the probe began into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. (May 17) AP, AP

ENGLEWOOD, Colorado – Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen said that he has yet to be briefed on the potentially volatile inquiry into possible surveillance abuses by federal authorities in the early days of the Russia investigation.

Rosen, in an interview with USA TODAY this week, said that he was unaware of the investigation’s status and did not know whether it has since morphed into a criminal inquiry.

“I don’t know the answer to that. I’d have to check and get back to you. I hear it described as an inquiry. I don’t want to say something that won’t be accurate. So let me defer on that one. “

The Justice Department later declined to elaborate. But Rosen’s deference on such a high-profile matter underscored the extreme close-hold on an inquiry launched by Attorney General William Barr and now managed by Connecticut U.S. Attorney John Durham.

It also highlights how Rosen, more than a month following his confirmation, has so far assumed a role largely out of the public eye in a stark departure from his predecessor, Rod Rosenstein, whose rocky two-year tenure was defined by his management of the Russia investigation and former Justice special counsel Robert Mueller.

John Durham: Attorney general taps top Connecticut federal prosecutor for review of Trump-Russia inquiry

""It (the surveillance inquiry) started before I arrived,"" Rosen said, adding that he was ""not currently"" being briefed on it. ""I had some generalized awareness, but I'm not meeting regularly with Mr. Durham.""

In April, Barr startled some lawmakers when he disclosed that he was reviewing the FBI's use of surveillance involving associates of President Donald Trump during the presidential campaign as authorities sought to understand Russia's interference efforts. At the time, Barr said he did not know whether officials had done anything wrong, though the review's disclosure was instantly cheered by some Republicans and Trump who has long disparaged Mueller's work as a ""witch hunt.""

""Spying on a campaign is a big deal,"" Barr told a Senate panel then. ""I think spying did occur. The question is whether it was adequately predicated.""

In May, the attorney general injected new urgency into that review when he tapped Durham, a long-time federal prosecutor, to review the ""genesis and the conduct"" of the FBI's investigation into possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia.

Durham's appointment came just three days before Rosen's confirmation as second-in-command at Justice.

The inquiry is proceeding, as Justice's inspector general is conducting its own review of how federal authorities obtained a warrant in 2016 to monitor former Trump foreign policy adviser Carter Page and his possible links to Russia. The results of that investigation are expected to be disclosed soon.

While not briefed on the Barr-Durham inquiry, Rosen nevertheless characterized it as ""serious.""

""I'm not sealed out,"" the deputy attorney general said, explaining that the attorney general had already taken on the coordinating role with Durham.

Rosen, 61, arrived at the Justice as a largely unknown player, having served in the top ranks of the Transportation Department – but never at the sprawling Justice Department.

His lack of Justice experience drew criticism from some Democrats who have expressed concern for the department's independence from the White House in the aftermath of the Mueller investigation.

""At this critical moment, we need a deputy attorney general who knows the Justice Department, who has experience in criminal investigations and prosecutions, and who is committed to the department’s role of enforcing the law independently,"" Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said after voting against Rosen's confirmation.

Acknowledging his role as ""the new guy,"" Rosen said the learning curve has presented few problems so far.

""You know it’s always risky to assume that you know what you don’t know,"" the deputy attorney general said. ""So, I’m sure there are things I don’t know. But it’s gone extremely well from my vantage point. I think some of the concerns that were raised about that (lack of experience) didn’t account for the fact that the Justice Department, in some ways, is like a big law firm. I spent a lot of time at a big law firm; there (are) tremendous resources available. And so the things that I need to get up to speed on, I have like the foremost experts in the world available to me to brief me on them.""

In his first month, Rosen has sought a fuller understanding of the opioid crisis in America and has taken a lead role in Justice's implementation of bipartisan criminal justice legislation aimed at easing sentences for non-violent drug offenders, reducing the federal prison population and assisting offenders' transition back into their communities.

Rosen said Justice is on schedule to deliver a critical tool to assess the needs and risks of future recidivism for federal prisoners. The program, required under the First Step Act, a sweeping measure intended to reduce the nation's prison population, is due by July 19.

On the same date, the federal Bureau of Prisons is set to recalculate the amount of so-called ""good time"" earned by federal offenders, an action that is expected to result in the release of 2,200 offenders to their home communities.

Barr: Attorney general says he will review government 'spying' on Trump campaign; 'I am concerned'

Rosen, who was touring the federal prison in Englewood, Colo., earlier this week in advance of the actions slated for later this month, said Justice was ""pushing hard"" to abide by the requirements of the new legislation.

Since the First Step Act was signed into law in December, Rosen said 1,093 drug offenders have been released from federal prisons as part of a provision that reconciled overly harsh sentences issued to crack cocaine offenders. Another 171 low-risk elderly inmates and 46 chronically-ill offenders also have been released under terms of the legislation.

""I’m putting my personal attention on that,"" Rosen said of the legislation. ""The attorney general is, too.""

Rosen's personal attention to a separate prison-related matter, however, captured the most public notice of his tenure so far.

In a letter to Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance earlier this month, the deputy attorney general weighed in on the question of where former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort should be confined during his prosecution on state financial fraud charges.

Citing Manafort lawyers' concern for their client's ""health and safety"" if moved to a state prison, Rosen directly raised the issue with Vance, noting that that lawyers preferred that Manafort remain in federal custody where he is serving a 7.5-year sentence on a financial conviction. Such issues are generally not raised to the highest levels of the Justice Department.

Manafort: Reports: Manafort not headed to Rikers Island after DOJ intervened

Rosen dismissed the suggestion he was intervening on behalf of Manafort. He said he was merely attempting to resolve a question raised by federal prison officials.

""To me that seemed pretty benign,"" Rosen said. ""Maybe…I have to adapt to a new environment, as someone who came from another department. But it didn’t seem like an extreme measure to me to ask the New York district attorney, 'What do you think we should do with this?'""

Going forward, Rosen said he expects to apply a simple rule of management.

""It’s not my job to do their jobs,"" he said of the department's more than 110,000 employees. ""It’s to ensure that everyone is doing their job.""

Correspondence shows how climate change deniers got into EPA fuel economy rollback fight,https://electrek.co,"['Renogy Watts Volts Monocrystalline Solar Starter Kit', 'Chargepoint Home Wifi Enabled Electric Vehicle', 'Ev']",07-03-2019,2019,7,https://electrek.co/2019/07/03/climate-change-deniers-epa/,"In the ongoing saga of the Trump administration’s efforts to roll back fuel economy standards, it’s been known that automakers sought to ease the rising MPG requirements set by the Obama administration. But a new report reveals how a number of climate change deniers injected themselves into the conversation, pushing the administration to go “much further” than planned.

Recently released government emails show how these deniers even went so far as to call automakers “the opposition,” according to a new report from the New York Times.

Myron Ebell of the Competitive Enterprise Institute — described by the Times as “a free-market think tank in Washington that disputes that climate change is a problem” — did just that in a May 2018 email to an EPA official, among others.

Ebell, who leads the climate change-denying “Cooler Heads Coalition,” wrote that the administration should stick to the rollback. He was also, unsurprisingly, selected to lead the Trump administration’s EPA transition team in 2016.

As the administration finalizes its plan to roll back fuel economy standards, the automakers are concerned about a “split market” between California and states which plan to follow higher standards, and the other states. Last month, 17 automakers wrote a letter asking to stop the planned rollback.

Prior to that, in a letter sent to Trump this May, Ebell and his group wrote about the automakers’ pushback. From the Times:

“Their main concern is the expected legal battle with California,” they wrote. “In fact, what many liberal California politicians really want to do is ban gasoline-powered cars altogether.” Their letter went on to say: “You should dismiss this concern. We agree that in an ideal world, California would negotiate with you in good faith, but we all know that is not a reality in this current political climate.”

The administration still hasn’t shown any signs of pulling back.

As National Highway Traffic Safety Administration deputy administrator Heidi King simply told the Times, “In my experience, these rules tend to go to the courts regardless.” The NHTSA is making the new rules in conjunction with the EPA.

The Times also notes how another conservative group, American Commitment, generated “almost 1,600 public comments in support of the rollback, or 13 percent of the 12,000 comments received and posted by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.”

Many of these particular comments came with the same boilerplate language accusing Obama and California as wanting to ban the internal combustion engine, and so forth.

Even the oil companies seem to want no part of these efforts. BP sent a letter to EPA administrator Andrew Wheeler in June that found the oil giant siding with the automakers, asking the administration to focus on improving fuel economy, the Times said.

Electrek’s Take

As unsurprising as any of this might be to anyone who’s been following what’s going on with the fuel economy rollback — or with the current EPA and administration in general — it’s still gross beyond belief. A group of people that has absolutely no business even being involved in these decisions instead has an incredible amount of influence.

We’ve reached a point where even BP — BP! — is pushing back against the administration’s efforts.

Automakers are still not without blame in their role here. Not by a long shot, not at all. They’re the ones who opened this Pandora’s box and pushed the EPA to reduce emissions standards the first chance they got.

But now, at this point in time, it seems clear that if it were just a discussion between automakers that have realized the error of their ways and an administration that actually cared about listening to their concerns about what might happen to the market… or an EPA that cared about reducing emissions… or improving the environment… things could be at least a little different. There could be some sort of “compromise,” at a minimum.

But it’s not.

If you’re looking for a glimmer of hope on this, look to King’s quote about how “these rules tend to go to the courts regardless.” California and 17 other states already filed suit against the EPA last year for its proposed rollback. Upon finalization of the plan, legal challenges against the rollback only seem set to increase.

States will be leading the way in that regard, but after all this, wouldn’t it be something if the automakers stepped up with a legal pushback of their own? If the rules are indeed finalized as expected, we’re curious to see what the next move will be from the industry as they face the dreaded “split market.” After all, there’s nothing stopping them from wanting to meet the Obama-era standards on their own.

It's time to break up the Department of Homeland Security,https://www.cnn.com,['David Perry'],07-04-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/04/opinions/department-of-homeland-security-needs-dismantling-perry/index.html,"David M. Perry is a journalist and historian. He's the senior academic adviser to the history department at the University of Minnesota. Follow him on Twitter . The views expressed here are those of the author. View more opinion articles on CNN.

(CNN) Every day, it seems, we get another story about the horrible conditions in the US Customs and Border Protection detention facilities or Border Patrol officers behaving badly . This current crisis at the border and in the various immigration agencies is not just a byproduct of Trump and his advisers' virulent nativism, but a manifestation of the flaws built into the Department of Homeland Security. The DHS was never going to work. It's time to break it up.

The department was thrown together during George W. Bush's administration, forged in fear in the aftermath of 9/11. Today, it's a hodgepodge of diverse agencies -- including the TSA, FEMA, ICE, and many more -- often with conflicting missions, all of which have been subordinated beneath Trump's anti-immigrant agenda

I remember remarking to a friend in 2002, when the Homeland Security Act created the new department with broad bipartisan support, that ""Homeland Security"" sounded like something out of a dystopian novel. A year after 9/11, American politicians were afraid of another attack, they were being misled toward war in Iraq, compromising civil liberties in exchange for projecting a feeling of security, and making lots of mistakes, usually with wide margins of support from their constituencies.

As we head toward the 2020 election, and as horrific conditions in prison-like facilities run by the immigration agencies of DHS are headline news , it's long past time to take a sober look at the post-9/11 moment and find ways to fix some of those mistakes.

This week, as the Congressional Democrats were touring a Texas border facility run by Customs and Border Protection, ProPublica broke a story that described a secret Facebook group of some 9,500 current and former Border Patrol agents. Here, members ""joked about the deaths of migrants, discussed throwing burritos at Latino members of Congress visiting a detention facility in Texas on Monday and posted a vulgar illustration depicting Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez engaged in oral sex with a detained migrant."" The US Customs and Border Protection Agency has called the posts ""completely inappropriate"" and promised to investigate its officers

Examining these abuses shines a light on the folly of slamming immigration enforcement agencies (such as ICE and CPB) into a single department with agencies in charge of emergency management (FEMA), transportation (TSA), and energy (Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency), all bound together by a counterterrorism mission statement.

As security expert Bruce Schneier often says , in the aftermath of terrorism, politicians feel desperate, rationalizing: ""Something must be done. This is something. Therefore, we must do it."" That's the kind of thinking that created the Department of Homeland Security.

Immigration police from throughout the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement division of DHS, which includes ICE and CPB, seem to feel free to act with impunity , knowing they can resist oversight by citing the counterterrorism mission of DHS. Any budgetary limit on one agency opens up the other components to plundering, such as when DHS transferred nearly $10 million from the Federal Emergency Management Agency to ICE, the funds at least partially used for immigration detention and deportation, in the midst of the 2018 hurricane season.

JUST WATCHED Border patrol agent warns of derogatory culture at CBP Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Border patrol agent warns of derogatory culture at CBP 03:55

I'm far from the first to call for breaking up DHS and returning its components to other departments where they belong, back to pre-existing agencies like Transportation, Justice, and Energy. In 2006, not long after FEMA failed New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina, Yale sociologist Charles Perrow offered some ""dreary conclusions"" in Homeland Security Affairs, writing that DHS is not particularly adept at fulfilling its core mission of streamlining intelligence sharing among federal agencies while diverting funds from supporting first responders in the wake of natural disasters.

In 2011, David Rittgers, a legal policy analyst for the libertarian Cato Institute, made his case that ""the Department of Homeland Security should be abolished and its components reorganized into more practical groupings."" In 2012, Tulane scholar Kevin Gotham linked the 2002 Homeland Security Bill to an accelerated process of privatization of disaster relief at least partially responsible for the failures during Hurricane Katrina.

Former DHS counterterrorism official Matt Mayer, later a scholar of homeland security, wrote in 2015 , ""after twelve years of mediocre-to-poor operations and countless scandals ... the core functions overseen by DHS can be managed more effectively elsewhere, especially where territorial battles undermine operational efficacy.""

None of these authors are radicals. They are just looking at the mission of DHS, assessing its successes, condemning its many failures, and concluding that the agency can't be fixed.

DHS was a bipartisan mistake. It's made it harder for FEMA to respond to national disasters. It's enabled a culture of impunity and aggression among our immigration officers. It has a history emerging from a specific historical context and time. I believe that as the decades pass, historians like me will look back in sadness at the years after 9/11, when national unity was squandered in persuading Americans to abandon their civil liberties, plunging the nation into endless war, and laying the groundwork for our new regime of concentration camps (as some genocide scholars characterize them ) on the American border.

Ivory Mathews, who is coming off of her role as executive director of the Greenville Housing Authority, says they should be focused on the residents first.

""Some of the immediate changes that they will begin to see is just our ability to respond to them as they might have concerns and to know that their questions or needs aren't just going on deaf ears,"" says Mathews.

She outlined her 12-month plan to commissioners, starting with a top to bottom approach of reviewing and updating bylaws, providing training to the board of commissioners, and improving resident services.

She also stressed the importance of respect towards residents during her presentation.

""That is a culture that we will resonate deeply in this organization under my leadership.""

Mathews also wants to make sure there's a full assessment of the CHA's Public Housing Program and Housing Choice Voucher Program.

""For me, because I lived it, I want to make sure that every piece of oxygen that I breathe, can do the work to make sure that children and families are given the opportunity to live in stable housing,"" says Mathews.

Community leaders were also impressed with Mathews plan.

""I think the re-tooling process that we're going through is going to be a win-win not only for the residents, but for our community also.""

Board chair Ernest Cromartie III says he's excited for what Mathews will bring.

""We think that she brings the right skill set, competency, compassion needed to perform well and be the leader of the new path forward for the Columbia Housing Authority.""

Her role is as interim executive director and she's under contract with the CHA for a year, but Mathews expressed that she is interested in the permanent executive director role."
U.S. reviews export requests to Huawei with 'highest scrutiny': Commerce Department,https://www.reuters.com,"['Alexandra Alper', 'Min Read']",07-03-2019,2019,7,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-china-huawei-tech-commerce-idUSKCN1TY2HA,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government said on Wednesday it was reviewing license requests from U.S. companies seeking to export products to China’s Huawei Technologies Co Ltd “under the highest national security scrutiny” since the company is still blacklisted.

In an email to Reuters, the Commerce Department said that as it reviewed applications, it was applying the “presumption of denial” standard associated with Entity Listed companies, meaning applications are unlikely to be approved.

President Donald Trump surprised markets on Saturday with an announcement that U.S. companies would be allowed to sell products to Huawei [HWT.UL], which was placed on the so-called Entity List in May over national security concerns.

U.S. chipmakers, which had been seeking a carve-out for exports of less sensitive technology to the world’s top telecoms technology maker, welcomed the news.

But four days after Trump’s announcement on the sidelines of the G20 in Japan, industry and government officials were uncertain what the new policy will be.

“It seems like nobody has made up their mind as to what the policy is and, as a result, nothing’s changing,” said Douglas Jacobson, an international trade lawyer.

“There’s even less change than we anticipated if we’re still applying the presumption of denial,” Jacobson added, noting that he’s advising clients not to even apply for a license because it’s not worth their time and money under that review policy.

In an email to enforcement staff on Monday, seen by Reuters, John Sonderman, deputy director of the Office of Export Enforcement in the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security, sought to clarify how agents should approach license requests by firms seeking approval to sell to Huawei.

All such applications should be considered on merit, he wrote, citing regulations that include the “presumption of denial” licensing policy.

The Commerce Department spokesman said on Wednesday that the department intends to notify companies of decisions on export license applications once the review is complete.

White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said earlier this week that the government would allow “lower tech” chip sales that do not impact national security, echoing similar comments from National Economic Council Chairman Larry Kudlow.

The United States has accused Huawei of stealing American intellectual property and violating Iran sanctions.

It has launched a lobbying effort to convince U.S. allies to keep Huawei out of next-generation 5G telecommunications infrastructure, citing concerns the company could spy on customers. Huawei has denied the allegations."

On Aug. 3, 2016, Strzok wrote, ""I think we need to consider the lines of what we disclose to DOJ. For example, the last stipulation notes we will not disclose [the] identifies outside the FBI. I think you might argue the unauthorized disclosure might (reasonably) be expected to cause exceptionally grave damage to US national security...""

In an earlier discussion on Aug. 2, 2016, Strzok reported he had a “good meeting.” Page warned, ""Make sure you can lawfully protect what you sign. Just thinking about congress, foia (Freedom of Information Act), etc. I'm sure it's fine. I just don't know how protection of intel-type stuff works in that context.""

Fox News has learned some of the words and names that were redacted in the string of Strzok-Page messages; they are included below.

[NOTE: 'OUTBOX' messages are from Page, 'INBOX' messages from Strzok]

The New York Times was first to report lengthy details about the 2016 meeting in question, when the FBI ""dispatched a pair of agents to London on a mission so secretive that all but a handful of officials were kept in the dark."" The report said this assignment included questioning Australian Ambassador Alexander Downer. Downer's information about then-Trump campaign aide George Papadopoulos helped lay the foundation for the FBI’s counterintelligence probe – which later grew into former Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation.

House Republicans, continuing to probe the texts, have considered August 2016 a pivotal month. They have been looking closely at these exchanges, and how long before the August meeting Downer reported the Papadopoulos information.

Inspector General Michael E. Horowitz, meanwhile, has been conducting a separate investigation into alleged surveillance abuse during the 2016 campaign, with that case in its final phases. And, this past May, Attorney General William Barr asked U.S. Attorney John Durham to probe the origins of the FBI counterintelligence case which was opened in late July 2016 by then-agent Strzok.

Fox News also has learned what's behind some of the redactions for the texts during that period, revealing new details of the Strzok meeting which took place at the U.S. embassy in London inside a secure facility known as SCIF.

In the texts, Strzok said the meeting did not include the No. 2 State Department official in London known as the deputy chief of mission.

Horowitz also has been investigating leaks from senior FBI officials as part of his probes. The expectation is that report will come after the surveillance abuse investigation.

The country’s annual celebration of its independence is not complete without family gatherings, picnics, parades, and the sights and sounds of fireworks.

Yet on national forests and grasslands, fireworks and other explosives are prohibited permanently. Public lands provide another option for celebrating the Fourth: Simply look up at night. Nature’s light show can provide its own “oohs and ahhs.” Stargazing, especially in areas where darkness is broken only by campfires, provides spectacular shows.

Although fireworks are not allowed, national forests and grasslands are the perfect spaces to spend your holiday. They provide entertainment for everyone, from camping, to cookouts, to places to enjoy water recreation.

If camping or picnicking is what you are planning, make sure you check with the local ranger district of your national forest or grassland for any bans on open flames, whether it’s a fire pit, grill or campfire. Even if there are no bans, please be cautious. The rule to ensuring your campfire is out is to drown, stir, drown and feel with the back of your hand to ensure the fire is fully out. Letting a campfire die out naturally is not safe. Hot embers could be smoldering underneath the ashes and could reignite. Remember, the ashes should be cold to the touch.

You can also use a mesh dome over fire pits to help stop embers from flying in the air and landing on dry grass. These embers could spark a fire in an area further than your campsite.

Other safety tips include being careful to not park on tall, dry grass. The heat from the car, or chains dragging along the ground if you are pulling something, could spark a fire. For more information, check out our Know Before You Go tips and wildfire prevention advice from Smokey Bear.

We want you to enjoy your Fourth of July safely. Remember, you are responsible for your safety and for the safety of those around you.

The Environmental Protection Agency has weighed in once again on the proposed Pebble Mine, and it has mine opponents cheering.

In formal comments released Tuesday, the EPA says a draft report on the mine’s environmental impact lacks important information and likely underestimates the risk to water quality and fish habitat in the Bristol Bay watershed.

Longtime Dillingham fisherman Norm Van Vactor, CEO of the Bristol Bay Economic Development Corporation, always believed the professional staff at the EPA would see the holes in the draft report on Pebble. Still, he worried some voices might be stifled for political reasons. Even before he finished reading the EPA comments, Van Vactor could feel his faith restored.

“It’s a powerful statement,” Van Vactor said. “I think it’s a powerful indictment.”

The two primary federal agencies involved in Pebble’s application for a Clean Water Act permit are the EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers. The Corps prepared the draft report looking at what impact the copper and gold mine could have on the environment. The EPA issued comments critical of that report.

“I mean, it’s almost like we were singing off the same page,” said Pebble critic Rich Borden.

He used to manage environmental matters for mining giant Rio Tinto but he believes the Pebble mine is too risky. Borden said the EPA pointed out some of the same deficiencies he noticed in the Army Corps’ report.

“Lack of detail, the fact that it’s conceptual, and there’s a lack of engineering drawings or even sufficient design to tell what the impacts are going to be – that’s exactly the same thing I said,” Borden noted. “They seem (to be) very substantive, honest comments. “

Meanwhile, the mine developers are soldiering on.

“Hey, you know, it’s Tuesday,” Pebble spokesman Mike Heatwole said.

The EPA’s comments haven’t disrupted Pebble’s work at the site. Heatwole said they’re doing wetlands-mapping of the proposed road corridor and plan to drill a dozen new holes for a groundwater study.

“There’s really nothing in their comments that come as a surprise to us,” Heatwole said. “And really the issue at hand is whether or not the issues highlighted by the EPA have been adequately addressed via the process, and if they have not, we’re confident the Corps will ensure this as they work toward finalizing the EIS for the project.”

The EPA provided pages and pages of recommendations for the Army Corps to improve its final environmental impact statement. The comments were signed by Chris Hladick, the EPA administrator for Region 10, which includes Alaska.

In a second document issued by EPA Region 10, the agency concludes the project “may have substantial and unacceptable adverse impacts on fisheries resources in the project area watersheds, which are aquatic resources of national importance.”

A disagreement between EPA Region 10 and the Corps could be decided by higher-ups in Washington. In the meantime, mine opponents say they hope the EPA’s comments embolden Alaska’s congressional delegation to take a stand against Pebble. They’ve been targeting Sen. Lisa Murkowski. She chairs the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. She also chairs the appropriations subcommittee that decides the EPA’s budget."

(Erik S Lesser/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock)

Members of Congress representing many of the D.C.-based federal workers whose jobs are about to be reassigned or moved to the Midwest are running out of ways to try to stop the Trump administration from relocating those offices.

Democratic lawmakers have written a flurry of letters, bills and amendments in a race to block the measures before the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30, with little success.

Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue last month finalized plans to move about 550 jobs at two scientific agencies in the Agriculture Department from Southwest Washington to the greater Kansas City region.

In a separate move, the administration has threatened to furlough and possibly lay off 150 workers at the Office of Personnel Management, the federal workforce’s human resources agency, if Congress blocks the administration’s plans to eliminate the department.

Proponents of the changes say they want to streamline operations, save taxpayer money, spread the economic effects of federal jobs beyond the nation’s capital and bring workers closer to the people they serve.

Opponents of the USDA’s move, including Democratic lawmakers and unions representing federal workers, say the agencies will hemorrhage talent because many scientists and researchers would rather quit than move their families 1,000 miles from the District.

[Perspective: Stark choice for USDA employees: Move to Kansas City or lose your job]

Capital region lawmakers say both of the administration’s proposals are part of a long-standing Republican campaign, bolstered by President Trump, to paint federal workers as unnecessary bureaucrats.

“In the White House, there is, among some people, a real disrespect for federal employees, animated by their disrespect for the government generally,” House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.), whose district includes part of Prince George’s County, said in a brief interview. “So if you’re hostile to government, you’re then . . . hostile to those who work in government.”

Rep. Gerald E. Connolly (D-Va.), who represents most of Fairfax and Prince William counties, said an “unrelenting assault” on benefits, compensation, hiring, workers’ rights, workplace conditions and appellate rights started when Republicans took control of Congress in 2011.

“The Republicans, and especially the Trump administration, view the entire federal enterprise, federal workers, as part of the swamp, and anything they can do to diminish it, demean it, from their point of view is a good thing,” Connolly said.

He pointed to a March 2017 resolution spearheaded by Republican Jason Chaffetz of Utah, then the chairman of the House Oversight Committee, that would have deemed it unnecessary for federal agencies to be located in the District. The measure, called Divest D.C., advanced to the full House but never got a floor vote.

Current efforts appear to be moving ahead unabated, raising concerns among federal workers that the administration could try to replicate the plans across government.

“It seems like if they are successful here, this could just be the tip of the iceberg,” said Sandra Salstrom, a lobbyist for the American Federation of Government Employees, a union for federal workers. “We don’t know who’s next.”

Connolly is chairman of the House Oversight Committee’s panel on government operations, which in May held a three-hour hearing titled “The Administration’s War on a Merit Based Civil Service.”

The hearing focused on the administration’s plans to move most Office of Personnel Management functions into the General Services Administration, the government’s real estate and procurement arm. The plan also would shift leadership to the executive branch, raising worries that the agency could become politicized.

The OPM-GSA merger was the subject of a rally last week organized by federal worker unions across from the current OPM headquarters.

In addition to Connolly and Hoyer, Rep. Don Beyer (D-Va.) and Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.), the District’s nonvoting delegate, took turns at the microphone in the shadow of a statue of Argentine independence hero José de San Martín.

Plans to move the USDA agencies — the Economic Research Service, a statistical agency, and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, which funds cutting-edge agricultural science — to Kansas City intensified Democrats’ frustration.

Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) of Montgomery County has tried to stop the USDA move through a bill and an amendment, and he sits on a committee that could block the leases on new office space if the contracts exceed a certain threshold.

He suggested the move was part of an ongoing effort by the administration to suppress scientific data on climate change.

“I will use every tool I have on both the Appropriations Committee and the Environment and Public Works Committee to block this move,” he said in a statement.

The USDA Office of Inspector General began a review of the relocation in November at the request of Norton and Hoyer. The report is under review by the agency before its release to Congress and the public.

Kevin Hunt, a geographer and head of his union bargaining unit at the Economic Research Service, is a Missouri native but does not plan to move.

He said he is sad to leave what he considers a “dream job” that allows him to do research and publish in scientific journals, pays well and has promotion potential. His partner has a good job elsewhere, making it difficult to move.

Hunt said he believes the agency belongs in the District, where collaboration with other agencies is seamless.

“It’s not about Kansas City,” he said in a phone interview. “It’s about moving people who are established here and who are at the top of their game.”

Lawmakers have inserted language into multiple appropriations bills to block the administration from spending money to move workers in the fiscal year starting Oct. 1.

However, the changes are on track to begin before the end of the current fiscal year on Sept. 30, which prompted Norton to suggest litigation as a next step. The basis for a legal challenge is unclear.

“I’ve got to be absolutely candid with you,” she told workers at the rally. “I am going to ask you to go into court. . . . I’m standing here this afternoon to say, ‘If we don’t beat them, I am sure that you will beat them. Keep fighting. We are there with you!’”

She added in an interview: “I think we have done everything we can do. We’re racing against the clock.”

Asked about litigation, an AFGE spokesman said they are pursuing collective bargaining to block or delay the moves.

House Democrats sue Treasury Department to obtain Trump's tax returns,https://www.salon.com,[],07-02-2019,2019,7,https://www.salon.com/2019/07/02/house-democrats-sue-treasury-department-to-obtain-trumps-tax-returns/,"House Democrats filed a lawsuit against the Treasury Department and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) on Tuesday over the White House's refusal to provide lawmakers with access to six years of President Donald Trump's tax returns.

The move escalates the standoff between the executive and legislative branches of government over the president's financial records, setting the stage for what is likely to be a lengthy legal battle. It comes after a months of fighting between the Democratic-led House Ways and Means Committee, which requested and then subpoenaed the returns, and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin.

The outcome of the dispute will likely determine whether the financial information that Trump has kept secret will be viewed by Congress and the public.

In the lawsuit, which was filed Tuesday in the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., the House Ways and Means Committee argued that the administration's refusal to provide the documents represents ""an extraordinary attack on the authority of Congress to obtain information needed to conduct oversight of Treasury, the I.R.S., and the tax laws on behalf of the American people.""

The panel's chairman, Rep. Richard Neal, D-Mass., is seeking Trump's tax returns under Section 6103 of the federal tax code that says the IRS ""shall furnish"" the returns of any taxpayer to the chairmen of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee for a legitimate legislative purpose.

Neal initially made the request for Trump's tax returns on April 3. After a series of letters between the panel and the administration, Mnuchin formally rejected the request at the beginning of May, arguing that the request represents an unprecedented abuse of power. Neal issued subpoenas to the IRS and Treasury Department on May 10.

The panel stated in the filing that they need access to the president's returns to ""carry out its broad mandate to oversee Treasury, the IRS, and the Nation's tax laws.""

Ways and Means member Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Texas said on Tuesday, ""This long-overdue legal action is needed to keep this bad president from setting a bad precedent. It should not take a court to affirm that 'shall' means 'shall.' But Trump will do what it takes to delay the inevitable, hiding his tax returns as long as he can.""

The Treasury Department and Republicans in Congress, meanwhile, have argued that the request represents an abuse of power.

Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas, the top Republican on the Ways and Means panel, previously urged Mnuchin to reject Neal's request, calling it an ""abuse"" of authority from Democrats on the committee.

""Weaponizing our nation's tax code by targeting political foes sets a dangerous precedent and weakens Americans privacy right,"" Brady wrote in an April 3 letter to Mnuchin. ""All Americans have a fundamental right to the privacy of the personal information found in their tax returns.""

Democrats have been on a hunt for Trump's tax returns since he bucked decades of tradition when he refused to release them during the 2016 election cycle,

Although not required by law, every major party presidential nominee since the 1970s has chosen to publicly release his or her tax returns except for Gerald Ford, who only released a summary. Financial disclosures can help paint a fuller picture of a candidate's business positions and interests by providing information about financial dealings, such as investments, donations, business relationships, assets and possible conflicts of interests.

The lawsuit over Trump's taxes is the latest development in an escalating feud between Congress and Trump, who has vowed to fight ""all the subpoenas"" looking into his administration and personal finances.

Trump has asserted executive privilege to block the release of an unredacted version of former special counsel Robert Mueller's report, as well as its underlying evidence, on Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. He also blocked subpoenas for testimony from former White House communication director Hope Hicks, former White House deputy counsel Annie Donaldson and former White House counsel Don McGahn.

Trump also sued the House Oversight and Reform Committee to block the panel for obtaining years of his financial records from accounting firm Mazars USA.

He also sued Deutsche Bank and Capital One in an attempt to block the banks from responding to subpoenas, issued by House Intelligence Committee and the House Financial Services Committee, seeking financial documents related to the president, his family and the Trump Organization.

The district court judges ruling on the two separate cases sided with Congress, saying the panels have broad authority to subpoena documents for investigative purposes that could result in legislative action. Trump's legal team appealed both rulings."
This new tool cuts VA disability claims’ processing time in half,https://www.fedscoop.com,['Tajha Chappellet-Lanier'],07-02-2019,2019,7,https://www.fedscoop.com/digital-va-disability-claims-tool-form-526ez/,"Written by Tajha Chappellet-Lanier

Veterans looking to receive compensation for service-connected disabilities can now use a self-service online tool developed by the U.S. Digital Service team at the Department of Veterans Affairs.

The new tool, built in partnership by the digital team (DSVA), the VA’s Office of Information Technology and the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA), aims to make it easier for veterans to submit disability claims to the agency. And it comes with a side benefit for all involved: It’s reportedly decreasing the overall adjudication times for claims.

The Disability Compensation Claim Tool is a new digital front end for the form 526EZ, a deeply bureaucratic 12-page document that begins with seven pages of instructions. In it, veterans are called upon to describe their service-connected injuries neatly and in a small table — a process that can be as taxing as it is confusing.

The new digital version is designed such that veterans can “get through the process easily and understand what’s happening,” Andrea Schneider, product lead at DSVA, told FedScoop in an interview. It’s not just an online version of the old paper form — it’s a revamped experience that guides veterans through the process, asking user-friendly questions and using the answers to populate a regular 526EZ on the backend. In a sense, the tool works to translate the kind of plain language a veteran would use into the bureaucratic officialese that claims adjudicators require.

“We don’t need the veteran to be an expert in our administrative processes,” Paul Shute, chief of operational innovation at the VBA’s Compensation Service, told FedScoop.

As always, DSVA emphasized user-centered design in building the tool, talking with “hundreds” of veterans to unveil their needs and testing an early version of the tool beginning in August 2018, the team said. The final version, which fully launched in March, is the culmination of about two years of “solid, dedicated effort,” Schneider told FedScoop.

“It’s been a labor of love,” she added.

But the tool isn’t just easier — it’s also faster. Before launch, the average disability claims processing time was somewhere between 108 and 120 days (FedScoop got differing feedback on this). The majority of that time, Shute told FedScoop, was spent gathering evidence — often in a back-and-forth between the veteran and the adjudicator. The new tool’s use of conditional logic and data integration has already managed, on average, to cut that time in half, the team said. Since March, there have been more than 10,000 claims submissions sent through the tool.

“It’s been an incredible project,” Schneider said. “It’s been impactful from a service perspective, feeling like we’re really able to touch people’s lives and make them a little bit better.”

The new tool is the latest in the VA’s continued focus on putting its veteran “customers” first. In November 2018 the agency launched a new version of VA.gov, one that puts veteran service front and center. And in May the agency officially added customer experience to its “Core Values and Characteristics” — the guidelines in the the Code of Federal Regulations that define priorities of VA employees as well as what the agency stands for.

“We depend on Veterans, their caregivers, and our business partners to help us form the vision of an improved Veteran experience,” James Gfrerer, CIO at the VA, said in a statement emailed to FedScoop. “Human-centered design, powered by IT, is transforming VA.”"

Many people consider watermelon a delicious summer treat — whether in granitas, salads or simply freshly sliced. It’s not surprising that July is National Watermelon Month.

Watermelons, which originated in Africa, have been grown in the North America since the 1600s and are an important U.S. crop. According to the National Agricultural Statistics Service, the United States produced 4,494,000 pounds of watermelon in 2016.

What you might not know is that the watermelon you eat today owes its existence to Charles Andrus, a plant breeder with the Agricultural Research Service (ARS) Vegetable Breeding Laboratory. In 1954, Andrus developed the watermelon variety “Charleston Gray,” which takes its name from the South Carolina city where the lab is located. In fact, the humble “Charleston Gray” is in the lineage of 95 percent of watermelons grown in the world today.

Unfortunately, like many other crops, watermelons are susceptible to a variety of diseases and pests, including anthracnose and aphids.

Over the years, scientists at the ARS U.S. Vegetable Laboratory in Charleston have continued studying watermelons in an effort to develop new varieties that are more resistant to diseases and pests. To that end, ARS has been evaluating the genetic diversity within different kinds of watermelon germplasm. The genome of the domesticated watermelon contains 23,440 genes. Sequencing the genome would make valuable traits, such as disease resistance, available to breeders and ultimately growers for breeding watermelons with enhanced protection against major diseases.

Now 65 years after its debut, the “Charleston Gray” watermelon is back in the spotlight. In a long-term study, a research team led by ARS geneticist Amnon Levi at the U.S. Vegetable Laboratory collaborated with scientists at the Boyce Thompson Institute to unlock the genome of ""Charleston Gray.""

Employing the most advanced genomic technologies available, the team also genotyped an additional 1,365 watermelon lines from the USDA National Plant Germplasm System. This important work will facilitate the identification of valuable new genes with the potential to confer disease and pest resistance—obstacles to enjoying this favorite summertime treat."

DOJ says citizenship question being dropped from 2020 Census: NY attorney general's office,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/doj-says-citizenship-question-being-dropped-from-2020-census-ny-attorney-generals-office,"The New York attorney general’s office said Tuesday the Justice Department has decided to print the 2020 Census without the citizenship question sought by the Trump administration, ending a contentious legal dispute over an issue that could soon affect the makeup of Congress and the Electoral College.

The Supreme Court ruled last week that the question couldn't be added for now, but left open the possibility that additional arguments could change its mind. Civil rights groups argued that the Trump administration's reasons for including the question were merely pretextual efforts to discourage illegal immigrants from responding to the Census.

Population counts from the Census are used to apportion House seats among the 50 states, and a new electoral map based on the Census will be in effect for the 2024 presidential election. States receive votes in the Electoral College equal to the number of members in their congressional delegation, counting both House and Senate seats.

In a tweet on Monday, Daniel Jacobson, who worked in the White House Counsel’s Office under President Obama, said a trial attorney at the Justice Department told him that ""the printer has been instructed to begin the printing process"" without the citizenship question.

""We won,"" Jacobson wrote.

In a statement to Fox News, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross tied the decision to the Supreme Court's ruling.

“I respect the Supreme Court but strongly disagree with its ruling regarding my decision to reinstate a citizenship question on the 2020 Census,"" Ross said. ""The Census Bureau has started the process of printing the decennial questionnaires without the question. My focus, and that of the Bureau and the entire Department is to conduct a complete and accurate census.”

For his part, House Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings, D-Md., issued a less-than-celebratory statement calling for answers, even as he praised the decision to scrap the citizenship question.

""I am encouraged that Administration officials dropped President Trump’s unconstitutional plan to postpone the Census just because he lost the Supreme Court case,"" Cummings said. ""The Trump Administration put our country through more than a year of wasted time and squandered resources—all in the service of an illegal attempt to add a discriminatory question based on a pretext.""

Cummings continued: ""The Attorney General and the Secretary of Commerce must now turn over all of the documents our Committee has subpoenaed on a bipartisan basis.""

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y, added, ""The exclusion of the citizenship question from the census is a victory for our democracy and for fair representation of all communities in this country.""

President Trump had tweeted that he had asked lawyers if the count can be delayed until the Supreme Court can reevaluate the matter, based on additional evidence supporting the administration's justifications for adding the citizenship question.

The Supreme Court, in its ruling last week, did not prohibit a citizenship question out of hand but dismissed the administration's provided rationale as insufficient.

However, Kristen Clarke, president and executive director of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, told Fox News on Tuesday that the Supreme Court was unlikely to change its mind. Clarke's team successfully challenged the Trump administration on the use of the citizenship question in federal court in California, and was one of several groups to bring such lawsuits.

“The Supreme Court’s ruling left little opportunity for the administration to cure the defects with its decision to add a citizenship question and, most importantly, they were simply out of time given the impending deadline for printing forms,"" Clarke said.

Experts agreed that any delay could gum up the U.S. Census Bureau's finely calibrated timetable for the 10-year count. Monday was the deadline to start printing the 600 million documents that will be mailed to 130 million households for next April's census count.

CAL THOMAS: CENSORING THE CENSUS IS ABOUT POLITICS, NOT THE LAW

For months, the Trump administration had argued that the courts needed to decide quickly whether the citizenship question could be added to the 2020 census because of the looming deadline.

""I think it's very important to find out if somebody is a citizen as opposed to an illegal,"" Trump told reporters Monday. ""There's a big difference to me between being a citizen of the United States and being an illegal.""

Former President Barack Obama's administration didn't ask the citizenship question in the 2010 census. The citizenship question was last asked on the census in 1950, but beginning in 1970, a citizenship question was asked in a long-form questionnaire sent to a relatively small number of households, alongside the main census. In 2010, there was no long-form questionnaire.

""There is no credible argument to be made that asking about citizenship subverts the Constitution and federal law,"" Chapman University law professor and constitutional law expert John Eastman told Fox News.

From a logistical standpoint, any delay ""would be a nightmare,"" said John Thompson, who served as Census Bureau director during Obama's second term.

The bureau already has been in the process of signing almost 250 office leases across the U.S. and has hired 1,500 specialists partnering with community organizations to encourage people to participate in the census. More than 170,000 recruits already have filled out applications for the almost half-million positions being created for the count. The bureau has helped set up more than 1,500 committees nationwide working to get everyone to respond.

Furthermore, Congress would have to change the law for the count to be delayed because Title 13 of the U.S. Code mandates that it take place on April 1, 2020, Thompson said.

""I don't think there's any ambiguity, but I'm not a lawyer,"" Thompson said.

Fewer people are expected to fill out the questionnaires using paper than in years past because the bureau for the first time is relying on most respondents to use the Internet to answer questions. Still, printed postcards and letters are to be sent out next March reminding residents it's time to answer the questionnaire, and those who don't respond digitally are expected to be mailed paper questionnaires.

As recently as last week, the Trump administration's solicitor general wrote in court papers that the Census Bureau needed to finalize the questions by June. Any changes to the paper questionnaire after June would impair the bureau's ability to conduct the count in a timely manner, wrote the solicitor general, Noel Francisco.

More than two dozen Democrats in the U.S. Senate last week sent a letter urging Ross to drop any further pursuit of the citizenship question because it would delay the bureau's ability to conduct the count.

""The 2020 Census is less than half a year away, and any unnecessary delay in operations would impact the ability of the Census Bureau to count every person in our country,"" the letter read.

This past May, Montana Republican Sen. Steve Daines introduced legislation that would require the census to include a citizenship question.

""This is America,"" Daines told Fox News at the time. ""We are a sovereign nation. It's absurd that we don't know how many citizens and non-citizens are living in this country. That's why I'm introducing this bill to require a citizenship question on the census - and ensure that states harboring millions of illegal immigrants are not rewarded with additional taxpayer dollars.""

EPA plan to limit animal testing raises toxic chemical regulation concerns: report,https://thehill.com,[],07-03-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/451618-epa-moving-ahead-with-plan-to-phase-out-animal-testing-report,"The Intercept reported Wednesday that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is looking to push ahead with a plan to phase out animal lab testing, which is raising concerns among some public health and environmental advocates who say the testing is needed to evaluate the toxicity of chemicals.

EPA chief Andrew Wheeler Andrew WheelerEPA plan to limit animal testing raises toxic chemical regulation concerns: report EPA's backward accounting protects polluters, not the people Overnight Energy: Top EPA official stepping down amid ethics probe | Critics slam EPA for rolling back union protections | Trump officials open door to controversial Alaska mining project MORE signaled the agency will slash funding on experiments tested on mammals in half by 2025 and look to stop using mammal studies for the approval of new chemicals by 2035, in an internal department memo reviewed by The Intercept.

The EPA, however, is denying The Intercept's report that it is looking to phase out animal testing, calling it inaccurate. It did acknowledge it is seeking to reduce and replace animal testing requirements.

""Though, EPA does look to announce sometime soon agency goals to reduce the number of animals impacted by EPA testing. Human health will be fully protected under any final EPA policy goal to reduce reliance on animal testing,"" an EPA spokesperson said in an emailed statement. ""EPA can protect human health and simultaneously reduce, replace, and refine animal testing requirements.""

According to The Intercept, the EPA is looking to use alternative methods to animal testing, such as computer modeling and tests on cells, to measure chemical toxicity.

However, scientists warn that the alternatives are not yet able to replicate mammal studies for regulation — which many say is the reason the federal agency is looking to make the policy change, The Intercept reports.

""EPA is well aware that these cells don’t replicate human metabolism. So when it comes to bioactivation, they’re going to miss all that — and they know that,"" Thomas Zoeller, a biologist at the University of Massachusetts Amherst who studies the health effects of man-made chemicals such as polychlorinated biphenyls, told The Intercept."

Trump tweet breaks Interior Department webpage,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-02-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/trump-tweet-breaks-interior-department-webpage,"A tweet from President Trump’s account generated so much web traffic to the Department of Interior’s press release regarding Fourth of July celebrations that it broke the webpage.

“What to Expect At This Year’s Annual Fourth of July Celebration,” the article was titled.

Trump’s tweet gained more than 6,000 likes and 2,000 retweets in less than 20 minutes.

The link to the press release was broken for about 30 minutes. It has since been fixed.

Trump has been hyping up his first-ever “Salute to America” event on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. — an event that will feature U.S. Army Abrams Tanks and shutdown the airspace around Washington during and after Trump’s speech.

"Giants Fans Can Find Solace in California, U.S. Agriculture’s MVP in Sales",https://www.usda.gov,"['Posted Gary Keough', 'Director', 'Nass Pacific Region In']",07-05-2019,2019,7,https://www.usda.gov/media/blog/2019/07/05/giants-fans-can-find-solace-california-us-agricultures-mvp-sales,"Posted by Gary Keough, Director, NASS Pacific Region in Research and Science

While California’s value of agricultural products sold increased 6 percent from the last Ag Census, so did production expenses in the Golden State. According to the 2017 Census of Agriculture, agricultural production expenses increased 7 percent from 2012 to 2017.

It might not be the Giants’ year in baseball, but in U.S. agriculture, California is clearly the MVP in sales. According to the 2017 Census of Agriculture, California’s 70,521 farms ranked No. 1 in agricultural sales with $45.2 billion; this accounted for nearly 12 percent of the U.S. total and was over $16 billion more than the No. 2 state. In addition, Fresno, Tulare, Monterey, Kern, Merced, Stanislaus, and San Joaquin Counties led all U.S. counties in sales. In fact, Fresno County’s agricultural sales were greater than 25 states.

The Golden State’s commodity roster ranges widely from grapes to poinsettias to mozzarella. In 2017, California led the nation in crop sales ($33.4 billion) by toping all other states in sales of fruits, nuts, and berries ($19.7 billion); vegetables ($8.2 billion); nursery, greenhouse, and floriculture production ($2.9 billion); and other crops and hay sales ($1.0 billion). California also ranked third in cotton sales ($0.5 billion).

California ranked fifth in the nation for livestock and poultry sales ($11.8 billion). California’s the No. 1 milk producer in the country ($6.5 billion); it is also a top ten producer of: cattle and calves ($3.1 billion); poultry and eggs ($1.9 billion); aquaculture ($105.6 million); sheep, goats, wool, and mohair ($86.9 million); and other animals and animal products ($76.6 million), and equine ($48.3 million).

Looking for that little known statistic to plug into your own sabermetrics of agriculture? California is the top state for using renewable energy producing systems in agriculture with 14,552 farms. Solar is the state’s most common renewable energy producing system on farms and ranches.
