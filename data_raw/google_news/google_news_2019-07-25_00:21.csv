What If They’re Not Coming for the Jews This Time?,https://www.theatlantic.com,"['David Frum', 'Staff Writer At']",07-24-2019,2019,7,https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/07/has-trump-abandoned-anti-semitism/594619/,"This special exemption poses a moral quandary for communally concerned Jews quite unlike anything in our collective experience.

Jewish collective life in America has been built on the assumption that people who espouse any form of bigotry—whether against African Americans, or gays, or the disabled—will, sooner or later (and probably sooner!), also turn upon Jews. The famous Martin Niemöller poem begins, “First, they came for the socialists”; only in the third line do they “come for the Jews.”

But what if a new generation of bigotry arose, attended by a strong, take-it-to-the-bank guarantee: This time, they are not coming for the Jews—not sooner, not later. That ancient obsession is laughably out of date. Today we have other concerns. Here’s a photograph of me posing alongside Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. He likes George Soros even less than we do!

David Frum: Trump is baiting Democrats

What if American Jews found themselves facing people who practiced a politics of incitement, but not against Jews—indeed, who found it more useful to cast themselves as allies of Jews?

Trump usually has, at most, a perfunctory word for mass shootings and hate crimes. But Trump traveled in person to pay respects to the victims of the Pittsburgh synagogue shooter. Vice President Mike Pence had led the way, personally helping to restore a desecrated Jewish cemetery in St. Louis, Missouri, early in 2017.

When Trump attacked Representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, he specifically cited her record of tweets and statements about Jewish money supposedly swaying Congress in favor of Israel. Among other pieces of classic anti-Semitic language, Omar had said, “I want to talk about the political influence in this country that says it is okay for people to push for allegiance to a foreign country.”

Statements like that goaded President Barack Obama’s former chief of staff Rahm Emanuel to write here in The Atlantic: “No one is questioning the right of members of Congress and others to criticize Israeli policies. But Omar is crossing a line that should not be crossed in political discourse. Her remarks are not anti-Israel; they are anti-Semitic.” Her words set in motion a resolution in the House of Representatives to condemn anti-Semitic and other bigoted speech.

By contrast, the Trump administration has more than fulfilled the wishes of many American Jews on issues from moving the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem to condemning Palestinian incitement to countering the Iranian nuclear program. At the Department of Justice’s conference last week, Barr said:

Far too often, Jews and Jewish communities in America suffer outside the spotlight. New York City, this past year, has seen a sharp uptick in attacks on Orthodox Jews, particularly in the Crown Heights neighborhood. People are attacking Jews in the streets and vandalizing synagogues. In Massachusetts in March, vandals desecrated 59 gravestones in a Jewish cemetery, knocking over headstones and scrawling swastikas and hateful graffiti. While the tragic attacks in Pittsburgh and Poway appropriately drew national attention, these attacks and others like them in communities across the country are, sadly, less well known outside the Jewish community. But they form the daily background of concerns about security and safety that many in the Jewish community feel. As attorney general and a fellow citizen, I want to assure the Jewish community that the Department of Justice and the entire federal government stands with you and will not tolerate these attacks.

As measured by polls, the large majority of American Jews recoil from Trump and his administration. Yet if you spend time in the organized Jewish world, you have probably noticed an early but unmistakable warming to the president. The warming is most pronounced among the older, more communally committed, and more Israel-focused part of the Jewish world."
Trump keeps losing tech policy fights,https://www.theverge.com,['Jul'],07-24-2019,2019,7,https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/24/20726401/trump-tech-policy-fights-twitter-algorithm-cryptocurrency-regulation-ftc-facebook-doj-fcc,"We’re two and a half years into Donald Trump’s presidency, and one thing is clear: his administration keeps getting absolutely railroaded in tech policy fights.

Unlike Barack Obama, whose administration’s oversight of the tech industry was marked by general coziness and a revolving door of industry players, Trump has been far more aggressive with the tech industry, weighing in on everything from Twitter’s algorithm to cryptocurrency regulation. But almost every time, his efforts have resulted in weak enforcement changes, whipsaw policy confusion among free-market conservatives, and / or outright losses. Take the three biggest policy fights so far:

None of those are good outcomes, and those are just the big three. But there are more:

You might agree with some of these outcomes, or you might disagree. (I think imposing heavy new speech regulations on private platform companies is a bad idea, but I know lots of people who disagree!) But the pattern is abundantly clear: Trump enters tech policy fights with inconsistent policy positions, doesn’t quite have the legal horsepower or agency resources to muscle through the consequences, and then backs down in a way that rarely improves or even changes the outcome for consumers or citizens.

Trump enters tech policy fights with inconsistent positions, doesn’t have the horsepower, and then backs down

Just ask yourself, honestly: is this Facebook fine really going to change anything about how Facebook works? Is Dish Network really going to become a viable fourth national wireless carrier after all of these spectrum transfer machinations? Do you know if Huawei should be banned from working with US tech companies or not? Do you think AT&T and Verizon are really going to get better about selling your data all over the place?

There are a lot of reasons why Trump keeps attacking tech and media companies — some of them are political, some of them are policy-oriented, and some of them are clearly, deeply personal. But whatever the motivations, it’s time that these companies faced meaningful oversight and checks on their power. They are a new class of gatekeepers with unprecedented power over American life, and it’s important to hold them accountable.

But so far, Trump hasn’t been able to do it."
Trump administration scores win over challenge to asylum restriction,https://www.foxnews.com,['Ronn Blitzer'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-admin-scores-win-over-move-to-limit-asylum-claims,"A federal judge decided Wednesday to leave in place a Trump administration rule that imposes restrictions on individuals seeking asylum in the United States if they passed through a third country on their way to the border between the U.S. and Mexico, potentially leading to a sharp reduction in Central American migrants entering the country.

The rule, published in the Federal Register last week, requires people seeking asylum to first apply in one of the countries they pass through on their way to the U.S., with certain exceptions. The rule was quickly met with a legal challenge from advocacy groups, who moved for a temporary restraining order blocking the rule. After a hearing in Washington, D.C. federal court, District Judge Timothy J. Kelly denied the motion. The rule will remain in place for the duration of the case, unless the decision is successfully appealed.

LINDSEY GRAHAM CLAIMS BORDER FRAUD SO PREVALENT 'A TERRORIST COULD EASILY GET IN'

""We are disappointed in the court's decision today,"" said Claudia Cubas, litigation direction for the Capital Area Immigrants' Rights Coalition.

The White House called the ruling ""a victory for Americans concerned about the crisis at our southern border,"" adding, ""Tens of thousands of migrants making opportunistic asylum claims have not only exacerbated the crisis at our southern border but also have harmed genuine asylum seekers, who are forced to wait years for relief because our system is clogged with meritless claims.""

Kelly, who was appointed to the bench by President Trump said the immigrant advocate groups who filed the lawsuit did not show that their work would be irreparably harmed if the policy moved forward.

With certain exceptions, the rule requires individuals to apply for and be denied asylum in another country in order to apply in the U.S. That means that migrants from Central American nations who travel through Mexico – who make up a significant portion of recent asylum seekers – will not be eligible for asylum in America unless they previously applied for asylum in Mexico or any other country they traversed and were turned down.

The new rule’s exceptions include certain cases of human trafficking.

The rule is meant to crack down on asylum seekers coming to the U.S. more for economic reasons than to escape persecution in their home countries. Administration officials say this could help close the gap between the initial asylum screening that most people pass and the final decision on asylum that most people do not win. The goal in part is to allow quicker determinations in these cases.

The policy follows the Trump administration's Migrant Protection Protocols, commonly referred to as the ""remain in Mexico"" policy. Under that policy, asylum seekers were often told to go back to Mexico to await hearings, rather than be allowed to remain in the U.S.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION AIMS TO EXPAND FAST-TRACK DEPORTATIONS ACROSS US, LEGAL FIGHT EXPECTED

Democrats railed against that policy, with 2020 hopeful Beto O'Rourke calling it ""inhumane.""

A reduction in asylum seekers would ease the burden on federal agencies currently overwhelmed by the volume of individuals seeking entry into the U.S.

Detention facilities have been notoriously stretched for resources, resulting in outcries against the government. The criticism has particularly been strong when it comes to the conditions in which migrant children have been kept.

US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin Thinks Outlook for Bitcoin Is Bleak,https://www.coindesk.com,[],07-24-2019,2019,7,https://www.coindesk.com/ius-treasury-secretary-mnuchin-thinks-outlook-for-bitcoin-is-bleak,"U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin commented on cryptocurrency’s future viability, in an interview on Wednesday.

“I can assure you I will personally not be loaded up on bitcoin in 10 years,” Mnuchin said on CNBC’s Squawk Box. “I would bet even in five to six years I won’t even be talking about bitcoin as Treasury Secretary.”

While Mnuchin’s comments today do not elucidate his specific regulatory policies, he said previously that cryptocurrencies pose “risk to the financial system” if misused like Swiss bank accounts.

To prevent financial crime or monetary distortion, the Secretary has called upon the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) and the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) to design guidance that will hold cryptocurrencies to the highest standards.

Today he added, “We’re going to make sure we have a unified approach and my guess is that there are going to be more regulations that come out from all these agencies.”

On July 18, Mnuchin erroneously claimed that fiat currencies are not vehicles for money laundering, while “there are billions of dollars of transactions going on in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for illicit purposes.”

Several media outlets – including Squawk Box anchor Joe Kernan, at the time – responded with incredulity. Tom Robinson, CEO of research firm Elliptic, wrote an OpEd for VentureBeat claiming, “Less than 0.5 percent of bitcoin transactions are used for illicit purchases.”

""I can assure you I will personally not be loaded up on bitcoin"" in 10 years, says Treasury Secretary Mnuchin #bitcoin pic.twitter.com/0J5acWQwRO — Squawk Box (@SquawkCNBC) July 24, 2019

While Mnuchin seems to think crypto’s future is bleak, he continues to bat for the U.S. dollar.

Mnuchin added later in today’s interview, “I think the dollar is the reserve currency in the world. It’s in our interest. We want to maintain it.”

"The “Whoa!” moment of the Mueller hearings so far, explained",https://www.vox.com,['Jul'],07-24-2019,2019,7,https://www.vox.com/2019/7/24/20708624/olc-opinion-ted-lieu-mueller-congress,"Special counsel Robert Mueller didn’t charge President Donald Trump with obstruction of justice during the Russia investigation, but he didn’t exonerate the president, either.

The reason for that, according to Mueller, is that he believes a Justice Department opinion bars him from charging a sitting president with a federal crime.

It was therefore no surprise that Mueller was asked about his position during Wednesday’s House Judiciary Committee hearing, leading to one of the most controversial moments of the session.

“I’d like to ask you the reason, again, that you did not indict Donald Trump is because of OLC [Office of Legal Counsel] opinion stating that you cannot indict a sitting president, correct?” Rep. Ted Lieu (D-CA) asked Mueller.

Mueller’s response was straightforward: “That is correct.”

That moment set off a bit of a firestorm among left-leaning watchers. Greg Sargent, a liberal commentator at the Washington Post, tweeted, “Whoa!” Nicholas Kristof, an opinion writer for the New York Times, called Mueller’s response “the big news so far” and “very significant.”

Mueller reiterates that OLC decision is reason why he didn't indict Trump pic.twitter.com/urwwpEWoNb — TPM Livewire (@TPMLiveWire) July 24, 2019

But this reaction, frankly, is just wrong. Here’s why.

Mueller has repeatedly said he didn’t make a decision on indicting Trump

Mueller spent much of his report giving reasons for why he didn’t charge Trump with a crime.

In addition to the Justice Department opinion, Mueller cited that it would be unfair to indict Trump when he can’t defend his name in court.

“The concerns about the fairness of such a determination would be heightened in the case of a sitting President, where a federal prosecutor’s accusation of a crime, even in an internal report, could carry consequences that extend beyond the realm of criminal justice,” he wrote.

And asked earlier in Wednesday’s hearing by Rep. Guy Reschenthaler (R-PA) if he decided not to prosecute Trump, Mueller responded that “we made a decision not to decide whether to prosecute or not.”

In other words, the Justice Department policy wasn’t the only thing keeping Mueller from charging Trump with a federal crime. Many factors, including Mueller’s views of fairness, explain his non-decision decision.

Mueller later clarified his response to Lieu at the start of the House Intelligence Committee hearing hours later.

“I want to go back to one thing that was said this morning by Mr. Lieu who said, and I quote, ‘you didn’t charge the president because of the OLC opinion.’ That is not the correct way to say it,” Mueller said in his statement. “As we say in the report and as I said at the opening, we did not reach a determination as to whether the president committed a crime.”

It’s understandable why many have latched onto the Lieu moment. After all, it would be a massive admission by Mueller under oath. But it seems he was a bit imprecise in answering the lawmaker, or at least didn’t make his true feelings clear.

Put together, the Mueller-Lieu exchange is not the bombshell it’s being made out to be. And if you don’t believe me, just listen to Mueller himself."
Justice Department launches antitrust probe into big tech,https://arstechnica.com,['Kate Cox'],,,,https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/07/justice-department-launches-antitrust-probe-into-big-tech/,"The Department of Justice is launching an antitrust probe into some of the world's biggest and most influential tech companies, the agency announced Tuesday.

The department's Antitrust Division, which is responsible for reviewing and enforcing issues relating to mergers, monopolies, competition, and price-fixing, said its review would ""consider the widespread concerns that consumers, businesses, and entrepreneurs have expressed about search, social media, and some retail services online.""

“Without the discipline of meaningful market-based competition, digital platforms may act in ways that are not responsive to consumer demands,” Makan Delrahim, head of the Antitrust Division, said. “The Department’s antitrust review will explore these important issues.”

The DOJ didn't name any names, but the list of ""market-leading online platforms"" accused of stifling competition through dishonest tactics, or simply of being too big for competitors to exist against, generally has Amazon, Facebook, and Google at the top; all three companies' stocks immediately tanked following the announcement.

Reports by several media outlets earlier this year, citing the ever-popular ""sources familiar with the matter,"" indicated the DOJ and Federal Trade Commission were planning something of a divide-and-conquer approach to tech sector regulation, with the DOJ digging into Apple and Google, and the FTC handling Amazon and Facebook.

Widespread scrutiny

The Justice Department is just the latest, not the first, body to take a hard look at what the tech sector has gotten up to in the past decade.

Congress kicked off its own probe into big tech's behavior last month, when the House Antitrust Subcommittee launched a bipartisan investigation into ""competition in digital markets."" The subcommittee chair, Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.) at the time called the growth of monopolies in the US economy ""one of the most pressing economic and political challenges we face today.""

Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat who is one of the party's leading candidates in the 2020 presidential primary race, in March issued a call to use existing antitrust law to break up Amazon, Google, and Facebook.

Traditional bricks-and-mortar retailers have also been asking regulators to update antitrust policy in order to rein in Google and Amazon, which dominate the online marketplace through what the retailers say are anticompetitive practices.

The DOJ is also lagging behind its international peers. Germany, Austria, Italy, and the European Union have all launched separate antitrust investigations into Amazon's behavior with third-party merchants on its marketplace since November, and the EU has fined Google billions of dollars four separate times in recent years for violations of European monopoly law."
Mueller flubs on which president appointed him to prosecutor post in Massachusetts,https://www.foxnews.com,"[""Andrew O'Reilly""]",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/mueller-flubs-on-which-president-appointed-him-to-prosecutor-post-in-massachusetts,"Former Special Counsel Robert Mueller confused which president appointed him the United States Attorney for the District of Massachusetts back in the 1980s during his congressional appearance Wednesday.

Answering a question during a lengthy hearing before the House Judiciary Committee, Mueller said he thought President George H. W. Bush appointed him to the post in Massachusetts, but was quickly corrected by Rep. Greg Stanton, D-Ariz., who noted that Mueller was appointed by President Ronald Reagan in 1986.

Bush appointed Mueller as United States Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division in 1990.

EX-SPECIAL COUNSEL ROBERT MUELLER TESTIFIES TO CONGRESS -- LIVE BLOG

Stanton’s questioning was meant to emphasize Mueller’s long history in government and the respect he garnered from both Democratic and Republican presidents. The former special counsel also served as deputy attorney general under President George W. Bush and later as his FBI director – a post he continued under President Barack Obama.

Mueller’s flub on who appointed him in Massachusetts came after hours of questioning in which Mueller appeared confused or befuddled by questions or references. He was also unwilling or unable to offer crisp sound bites that could reshape already-entrenched public opinions.

He frequently gave terse, one-word answers to lawmakers' questions, even when given opportunities to crystallize allegations of obstruction of justice against the president. He referred time and again to the wording in his report or asked for questions to be repeated. He declined to read aloud hard-hitting statements in the report when prodded by Democrats to do so.

MUELLER REFUSES TO DISCUSS RUSSIA PROBE ORIGINS, STEELE DOSSIER IN TESTIMONY

Although Mueller declared at the outset that he would be limited in what he would say, the hearings nonetheless carried the extraordinary spectacle of a prosecutor discussing in public a criminal investigation he conducted into a sitting U.S. president.

Mueller, known for his taciturn nature, warned that he would not stray beyond what had already been revealed in his report. The Justice Department had instructed him to stay strictly within those parameters, giving him a formal directive to point to if he faced questions he did not want to answer.

Facebook and Other Big Tech Stocks Are Barely Moving on the DoJ’s New Probe. Here’s Why.,https://www.barrons.com,['Eric J. Savitz'],,,,https://www.barrons.com/articles/doj-investigation-tech-stocks-51563989279,"Text size

Large-cap tech shares are mostly shrugging off the news that the U.S. Department of Justice plans to review “the practices of market-leading online platforms.” Indeed, today’s news is brimming with reports on regulatory actions against tech businesses—but the real market moving news on tech this week will be financial.

Facebook (ticker: FB) reports earnings Wednesday; Alphabet (GOOGL) and Amazon.com (AMZN) report Thursday. On Tuesday, Snap (SNAP) reported huge user growth, and the stock is on fire. Investors don’t believe that Washington’s investigations will have a material impact on big tech’s financial results, so they are largely ignoring them for now.

It’s a busy day on the regulatory front, even aside from the DoJ story.

Facebook (FB) reached an agreement with the Federal Trade Commission to pay a $5 billion fine over the company’s data privacy practices. In announcing the penalty, the FTC said the agreement also “requires Facebook to restructure its approach to privacy from the corporate board-level down, and establishes strong new mechanisms to ensure that Facebook executives are accountable for the decisions they make about privacy, and that those decisions are subject to meaningful oversight.”

Facebook said the agreement “provides a comprehensive new framework for protecting people’s privacy and the information they give us.”

But Democrats on the Commission observed that the penalties were more or less meaningless in the larger scheme of things—something investors had already figured out.

“The proposed settlement does little to change [Facebook’s] business model or practices,” writes Commissioner Rohit Chopra in a dissenting opinion. “The settlement imposes no meaningful changes to the company’s structure or financial incentives, which led to these violations. Nor does it include any restrictions on the company’s mass surveillance or advertising tactics. Instead, the order allows Facebook to decide for itself how much information it can harvest from users and what it can do with that information, as long as it creates a paper trail.”

Commissioner Rebecca Kelly Slaughter writes in her own dissent that in the interest of shedding a spotlight on Facebook’s behavior, the FTC should have litigated the matter. “The Commission would better serve the public interest and be more likely to effectively change Facebook by fighting for the right outcome in a public court of law,” she writes.

Meanwhile, Facebook yesterday also reached a deal with the Securities and Exchange Commission to pay a $100 million fine “for making misleading disclosures regarding the risk of misuse of Facebook user data,” a case tied to the Cambridge Analytica scandal. (On Wednesday, Netflix happened to unveil a new documentary on Facebook and the Cambridge Analytica story called The Great Hack.)

Additionally, The Wall Street Journal reports that Apple (APPL) appears to be favoring its own apps in App Store searches. The Journal writes that “the company’s apps ranked first in more than 60% of basic searches, such as for ‘maps,’ the analysis showed. Apple apps that generate revenue through subscriptions or sales, like Music or Books, showed up first in 95% of searches related to those apps.”

While the DoJ announcement Tuesday didn’t name names, there’s little mystery about which companies the government has in mind.

“The Department’s review will consider the widespread concerns that consumers, businesses, and entrepreneurs have expressed about search, social media, and some retail services online,” the government said in a press release.

“The goal of the Department’s review is to assess the competitive conditions in the online marketplace in an objective and fair-minded manner and to ensure Americans have access to free markets in which companies compete on the merits to provide services that users want. If violations of law are identified, the Department will proceed appropriately to seek redress.”

The language suggests they are going after four of the world’s largest companies by market cap—Alphabet’s Google unit dominates search, Facebook rules social media, and Amazon.com is synonymous with online retail. Apple likely falls under the online retail rubric, as well, given its dominant App Store platform.

A spokesman for Google declined to comment on the DoJ announcement directly, and instead pointed to testimony last week by Adam Cohen, Google’s director of economic policy, during a House subcommittee hearing on online platforms. “In the face of intense competition, we are proud of our record of continued innovation,” he said. “We have helped reduce prices and expand choice for consumers and merchants in the U.S. and around the world. We have created new competition in many sectors, and new competitive pressures often lead to concerns from rivals. We have consistently shown how our business is designed and operated to benefit our customers.”

Apple declined to comment on the DoJ announcement, while Facebook and Amazon didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.

Microsoft (MSFT), largely a cloud play now and the world’s most valuable public company, was once the government’s favorite tech target. It appears to have avoided the investigators this time around.

It’s not entirely clear how the DoJ announcement relates to previous news that the FTC and the Justice Department had agreed to divvy up their investigatory responsibilities, with Justice taking on Apple and Google, and the FTC focusing on Amazon and Facebook. But the overall intent seems the same—to curb the behavior of tech giants.

So how is this likely to play out?

Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives wrote in a research note Wednesday that any push to break up the companies is likely to fail. Current antitrust law is intended to protect consumers against predatory pricing, not punish companies for being big and successful.

In the cases of Google and Facebook, the companies don’t charge for their primary products—so there’s no pricing, let alone predatory pricing. To assess the market effect of the companies on other measures isn’t impossible, but, Ives notes, it would likely require changes in antitrust law, and in the current political mood in Washington, that seems “exceedingly unlikely.”

Legislation could have a more immediate impact, though, particularly the pending California Consumer Privacy Act, which Barron’srecently covered. The law goes into effect in January and is intended to force changes in the way companies collect and sell personal information. For Google and Facebook, and increasingly for Apple and Amazon, the ability to sell targeted ads is of huge value. Federal legislation to do the same could be the route to real change in the tech business, with a higher probability of success than antitrust enforcement.

Ives predicts that Congress and the DoJ will investigate, and find “no harm, no foul.” He thinks investors should buy all of the big four stocks on any weakness relating to the investigations.

In afternoon trading, Facebook is down 0.4% to $201.51; Alphabet is down 1.2%, to $1,134.75; Apple is down 0.4%, to $208.03; and Amazon is 0.3%, to $1988.95. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite is up 0.4%.

DOJ announces investigation into big tech – TechCrunch,https://techcrunch.com,[],07-23-2019,2019,7,https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/23/doj-announces-investigation-into-big-tech/,"The Department of Justice announced that its Antitrust Division is reviewing how the world’s largest technology companies have gotten that way and whether their business practices reduced competition or hurt consumers.

In a statement the DOJ said that it will consider “widespread concerns that consumers, businesses, and entrepreneurs have expressed about search, social media and some retail services online.”

The language appears to be targeting Alphabet (the parent company of search giant Google), Amazon and Facebook specifically.

Last week representatives from technology companies were hauled in before Congress to testify about their companies’ policies and practices. They were met with withering criticism from both the left and the right sides of the aisle over their businesses practices.

Amazon was taken to task for its data collection and private label practices; Google for its ad business and manipulation of search results; and Facebook for just about everything involving the scope and breadth of its business or planned businesses.

Against that backdrop it’s no wonder the Department of Justice is getting in on the action."
"DOJ opens sweeping antitrust review of big tech giants, saying they may work against consumers",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/doj-opens-sweeping-antitrust-review-of-big-tech-giants-saying-they-may-work-against-consumers,"In a shot across the bow of online titans like Facebook, Google and Amazon, the Justice Department announced Tuesday it has opened a wide-ranging antitrust investigation of big technology companies and whether their online platforms have hurt competition, suppressed innovation or otherwise harmed consumers.

President Trump has relentlessly criticized the big tech companies by name in recent months. He and other top Republicans frequently assert that companies such as Facebook and Google are biased against him and conservative politicians.

“Without the discipline of meaningful market-based competition, digital platforms may act in ways that are not responsive to consumer demands,” DOJ antitrust head Makan Delrahim said in a statement. “The department’s antitrust review will explore these important issues.”

BIG TECH'S MOMENT OF RECKONING HAS ARRIVED

Antitrust law generally prohibits corporations from abusing monopoly power to harm consumers, and also prohibits companies from conspiring to fix prices or suppress competition through other anti-competitive activity.

In 2018, The Daily Caller published an article asserting that Google almost exclusively targets conservative sites for fact-checking -- and, in the process, often erroneously attributes statements to the conservative sites. Others blamed a software bug for the problem.

Some researchers have alleged anti-conservative bias in Google's search results. A leaked video of top Google executives conducting a company-wide meeting after the 2016 election showed them tearfully lamenting the results of the race, which would send Trump to the White House.

The DOJ's move comes as a growing number of lawmakers have called for stricter regulation or even breaking up of the big tech companies, which have come under intense scrutiny following a series of scandals that compromised users' privacy.

The Justice Department did not name specific companies in its announcement. But the DOJ did say it would look into ""widespread concerns that consumers, businesses, and entrepreneurs have expressed about search, social media and some retail services online.""

Additionally, the ""department’s Antitrust Division is conferring with and seeking information from the public, including industry participants who have direct insight into competition in online platforms, as well as others,"" the DOJ said.

GOOGLE VP GRILLED IN HEARING OVER ALLEGED BIAS AGAINST CONSERVATIVES

“Without the discipline of meaningful market-based competition, digital platforms may act in ways that are not responsive to consumer demands,” said Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim of the Antitrust Division. “The department’s antitrust review will explore these important issues.”

The DOJ said it will seek to assess ""the competitive conditions in the online marketplace in an objective and fair-minded manner and to ensure Americans have access to free markets in which companies compete on the merits to provide services that users want.

""If violations of law are identified, the department will proceed appropriately to seek redress,"" the statement concluded.

Google directed requests for comments to the testimony its director of economic policy, Adam Cohen, made to the House Judiciary Committee last week. Cohen reiterated the company's benefits to consumers.

“Google’s control over what people hear, watch, read, and say is unprecedented,” Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, the chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said at the hearing. “Google can, and often does, control our discourse.”

Cruz added: “The American people are subject to overt censorship and covert manipulation” by Google’s algorithm.

SEN HAWLEY TAKES ON BIG TECH, SEEKS TO ELIMINATE LEGAL PROTECTIONS AND UNIQUE IMMUNITIES THEY ENJOY

But Google’s vice president of global government affairs and public policy, Karan Bhatia, defended the tech giant – arguing that the company has no political bias and does not monitor content posted on its platforms. Bhatia noted that the company does censor or take down some content, but denied that there was any political motivation behind that.

“We work hard to fix our mistakes,” Bhatia said. “But these mistakes have affected both parties and are not a product of bias.”

He added: “We are not censoring speech on our platforms... We do have community guidelines against uploading, for example, videos that have violent imagery.”

Apple referred to comments from CEO Tim Cook, who told CBS last month he doesn't think ""anybody reasonable"" would call Apple a monopoly.

Earlier, the Washington Post reported that the FTC will allege that Facebook misled users about its privacy practices as part of an expected settlement of its 2018 Cambridge Analytica scandal.

The federal business watchdog will reportedly find that Facebook deceived users about how it handled phone numbers it asked for as part of a security feature and provided insufficient information about how to turn off a facial recognition tool for photos.

Advertisers were reportedly able to target users who provided their phone number as part of a two-factor authentication security feature.

The FTC established its own watchdog to probe big technology companies earlier this year, and shares antitrust authority with the DOJ.

Mr. Gregg, who moved to the United States to be with his husband, did not meet a five-year residency requirement. His lawyers say that requirement would not have applied if they had been treated as the married couple they are.

For two married United States citizens, “all the law requires is that one of them lived in America for at least one day,” said Aaron Morris, the executive director of Immigration Equality, which has worked on all three lawsuits.

“Marriage is so fundamental to how you define a family,” he said. “To disenfranchise a little girl of citizenship because she has two dads is invidious discrimination that has been struck down time and time again.”

The State Department declined to comment on Tuesday, citing pending litigation. In court documents, the department has argued that the policy does not discriminate and applies to opposite-sex and same-sex couples alike.

But gay couples argue that they are far more likely to be questioned about their conception methods when applying for citizenship. Immigration Equality said that it had heard from at least three dozen families in similar situations since mid-2017; by the organization’s account, most were same-sex couples.

In court documents, the State Department has said that rules for passing down citizenship for children born abroad are important for preventing fraud and ensuring that children born abroad have a sufficient connection to the United States to warrant citizenship."

Mueller scrambles hearing by tapping top deputy as counsel,https://www.politico.com,"['Andrew Desiderio', 'Kyle Cheney']",07-23-2019,2019,7,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/07/23/nadler-doj-mueller-testimony-1426721,"Robert Mueller's spokesman Jim Popkin on Monday said he didn’t know yet who would be joining the former special counsel at the hearing | Carolyn Kaster/AP File Photo Legal Mueller scrambles hearing by tapping top deputy as counsel Republicans called the plan a 'stunt' that could be a breach of House rules.

Robert Mueller’s top deputy will appear alongside him for his highly anticipated testimony on Wednesday, according to congressional aides familiar with the preparations, a last-minute curveball that came despite the Justice Department's demand that Mueller’s deputies refrain from testifying.

Aaron Zebley, Mueller’s longtime right-hand man, will appear as Mueller’s counsel when he testifies before the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday morning; but he will be formally sworn in as a witness for the House Intelligence Committee’s hearing with the former special counsel later that afternoon, an aide said.

Story Continued Below

Republicans said any decision to allow Zebley to accompany Mueller as a sworn-in witness would represent a breach of their tentative negotiations. Georgia Rep. Doug Collins, the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, called the prospect a “stunt” and said it could “jeopardize whether tomorrow's hearing complies with the rules of the House.”

“If Democrats believe it is the special counsel’s responsibility to testify to his report, they have no ground for outsourcing that duty at the expense of our committee’s integrity,” Collins said.

No Republicans on the Intelligence Committee, however, joined the public outcry.

Mueller spokesman Jim Popkin on Tuesday confirmed Zebley’s appearance for Mueller’s five hours of combined testimony before the House Judiciary and Intelligence committees.

“Aaron Zebley was the deputy special counsel and had day-to-day oversight of the investigations conducted by the office,” Popkin said. “He will accompany special counsel Mueller to the Wednesday hearings, as was discussed with the committees more than a week ago.”

Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), chairman of the Intelligence Committee, cautioned that Mueller — not Zebley — would be answering lawmakers’ questions.

“Our intention is that Mueller do the testifying and not have someone else do it for him,” Schiff said. “Now, there may be questions that one of his team is better situated to answer of a technical nature. But we don't want a hearing with Bob Mueller converted to a hearing with someone else.”

Both Zebley and James Quarles, another Mueller deputy, initially were expected to testify before the Judiciary and Intelligence committees behind closed doors, but those sessions were called off amid opposition from Attorney General William Barr.

Barr has said that Mueller’s deputies should not testify, and he suggested that the Justice Department would move to block them from appearing if the committees issued subpoenas to compel their testimony. It is unclear whether the Justice Department will try to disrupt Wednesday’s arrangement.

The move threatens to further inflame tensions between the Justice Department and House Democrats. Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler on Tuesday blasted President Donald Trump’s Justice Department as “incredibly arrogant” for instructing Mueller to limit the scope of his testimony Wednesday before the Judiciary and Intelligence panels.

But the New York Democrat predicted that the Justice Department’s Monday directive would not affect Wednesday’s highly anticipated pair of hearings with the former special counsel.

“I don't think it's much of an impediment, simply because Bob Mueller had indicated repeatedly that he was going to do exactly that,” Nadler said on CNN. “I think it's incredibly arrogant of the department to try to instruct him as to what to say. It's a part of the ongoing cover-up by the administration to keep information away from the American people, but I think that it's not going to have a real impact.”

And in a letter to Mueller late Tuesday night, Schiff said the Trump administration was seeking to “obstruct the authorized oversight activity and legitimate investigations of the committee.”

“The committee rejects the limitations that the Department of Justice has attempted to place on your testimony on the eve of your appearance before our committee,” Schiff added.

Mueller has stated that his 448-page report “is my testimony” and that he does not intend to speak about topics that were not already made public, presenting Democrats with a challenge when Mueller appears before the House Judiciary and Intelligence panels.

And on Monday, the Justice Department told Mueller that his testimony “must remain within the boundaries of your public report” because the president has asserted executive privilege over the investigation’s underlying evidence, POLITICO first reported.

Nadler said on Tuesday that Democratic lawmakers have “been operating under the assumption that he'll do essentially what he said — he'll stay more or less within the bounds of the report.” But the chairman also said Mueller “does not have to comply” with the Justice Department directives.

“He doesn't work for them,” Nadler said, “and that letter asks things that are beyond the power of the agency to ask even if he still worked for them.”

Despite the Justice Department’s letter to Mueller, it is unlikely the department will insist on having a lawyer in the room during Mueller’s testimony to lodge objections to certain questions — essentially relying on Mueller to self-police his remarks. Mueller is known to strictly adhere to Justice Department guidelines, and Democrats do not expect him to deviate from that practice,

poster=""http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201907/806/1155968404_6063098476001_6063107661001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404""

In May, Trump asserted executive privilege over Mueller’s entire report and underlying materials. The move came after the Judiciary Committee issued a subpoena for the unredacted report and all evidence underpinning it, and the Justice Department’s defiance of that subpoena led the panel to hold Barr in contempt of Congress.

Democrats are eager to ask Mueller several questions about his investigation and his legal conclusions, including whether he would have charged Trump with obstruction of justice if he were not the president — a reference to Justice Department policy that prohibits the indictment of a sitting president. While Mueller is unlikely to answer that question directly, Democrats say there are other ways to illuminate Mueller’s decision not to formally accuse the president of committing a crime.

The Judiciary Committee is expected to focus on five specific episodes of potential obstruction of justice — ones that, according to Mueller, met all three elements required for an obstruction charge.

Judiciary Committee Democrats held a mock hearing on Tuesday afternoon to prepare for their questioning of Mueller. They also rehearsed how they would respond to efforts by Republicans to discredit Mueller’s investigation or lodge procedural objections that could delay the hearing.

House Democrats are planning an all-out messaging blitz over the next few days, blanketing social media with excerpts of Mueller’s report and real-time clips from the hearing. It’s an effort to amplify any of the material Mueller gives them and line it up with the most damaging details of his report.

Democrats also have put together a five-page set of talking points for their colleagues who aren’t as deeply immersed in the Mueller report, distilling Mueller’s dense findings into a digestible summary they can use to help spread the caucus-wide message.

Judge Rules Trump’s EPA Flouting Clean Air Act As Denver Ozone Spikes Again,https://www.westword.com,['Chase Woodruff'],07-24-2019,2019,7,https://www.westword.com/news/judge-rules-trump-epa-flouting-clean-air-act-as-denver-ozone-spikes-again-11422270,"As ozone pollution in the Denver metro area took another turn for the worse this week, a federal judge ruled that the Environmental Protection Agency is violating clean-air laws by delaying a key decision on local air-quality standards.

In a ruling issued Monday, July 22, Judge John Kane of the U.S. District Court in Denver found that EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler has “failed to perform a nondiscretionary duty” by delaying a determination regarding the metro area’s classification under the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for ozone pollution. The partial summary judgment came as a result of a lawsuit filed by environmental group WildEarth Guardians against Wheeler and the EPA earlier this year. Court filings show that the agency didn’t object to Kane’s ruling.

“This is the Trump administration’s EPA on full display,” says Jeremy Nichols, WildEarth Guardians’ climate and energy program director. “They just refuse to comply with the law. They’re willing to keep dragging their feet to the point where they get ruled against in court, because they don’t want to comply. They don’t want to have to clamp down.”

The group's lawsuit revolves around a regulatory decision that was due to be made by the EPA earlier this year. For more than a decade now, a nine-county region known as the Denver Metro/North Front Range Nonattainment Area has exceeded federal standards for ozone pollution that were set by the agency in 2008. The state faced a January 2019 deadline to bring the area's air quality into compliance, or be reclassified from ""moderate nonattainment"" to ""serious nonattainment,"" which would require regulators to impose stricter regulations on polluters. The state missed the deadline — air pollution in Denver got worse last year, not better — but the EPA's attainment determination hasn't yet been made.

""This is a simple finding that they need to make,"" says Nichols. ""It's not a complicated action. It's very clear that Colorado failed to meet the 2008 ozone air-quality standards, so this shouldn't be happening. It's a sign of how nuts the Trump administration is, and how they just refuse to take their legal duties seriously. And unfortunately, it's our clean air that suffers.""

The EPA did not respond directly to questions regarding the attainment determination and when it's expected to be made. ""EPA supports the state’s efforts to address ozone issues along the Front Range,"" EPA Region 8 spokesperson Lisa McClain-Vanderpool said in an email. ""The Agency does not comment on ongoing litigation.""

Monday's court ruling came as ozone pollution in Denver began to rise to its highest level of the year so far, reaching an eight-hour Air Quality Index of 133 on Tuesday, July 23. Parts of metro Denver reached one-hour ozone concentrations of 100 parts per billion on Monday and Tuesday, according to state air-quality data — levels that are considered “unhealthy” for all groups on the AQI scale.

High levels of ozone pollution are expected to continue along the Front Range this week. In a forecast issued this morning, officials with the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment warned that ""active children and adults, and people with lung disease, such as asthma, should reduce prolonged or heavy outdoor exertion"" in the afternoon and evening, when ozone levels are typically at their daily peak.

Ground-level ozone is a so-called criteria pollutant that can cause a wide variety of negative health effects, from acute symptoms such as coughing and shortness of breath to chronic conditions like asthma and emphysema. It's formed primarily by the interaction between sunlight and ""ozone precursors"" like volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxides. In Denver, studies have shown that the two largest sources of ozone-forming pollutants are motor vehicles and oil and gas facilities along the Front Range, both of which can account for up to 40 percent of local ozone production on a given day.

A reclassification to serious nonattainment by the EPA would force CDPHE regulators to subject those emissions sources to a higher degree of scrutiny and regulation. In March, Governor Jared Polis withdrew a state request, made by his predecessor John Hickenlooper, for an extension to meet the federal ozone standards. ""There’s more we can do to protect our air quality and health, and we should do it sooner not later,"" Polis said at the time.

Even if the extension hadn't been withdrawn, it would have expired last week. Nichols and WildEarth Guardians, along with other environmental groups, have launched a campaign to pressure the CDPHE to act now, without waiting for the Trump administration to finally tell state officials what they already know.

""Having the backing of the EPA's finding forces them to [act], but the state shouldn't have to be forced to clean up the air,"" Nichols says. ""They could start to implement more rigorous permitting; they could start to put emissions on track. They could be taking some actions now.""

DOJ Announces Probe Into Big Tech Over Antitrust Concerns,https://gizmodo.com,"['Bryan Menegus', 'About The Author', 'Senior Reporter.

The Justice Department is finally set to being its long-rumored review of monopoly concerns in the areas of online search, ecommerce, and social media, specifically targeting big tech companies such as Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Apple. An exceptionally broad probe, the agency announced this afternoon it would seek to learn if such companies had “reduced competition, stifled innovation, or otherwise harmed consumers.”

The FTC and DOJ, which both possess antitrust powers, have been prepping for action against these mega-corporations for months, divvying up which agency would pursue which tech giant. Some of the companies being probed by the DOJ, like Amazon, were initially believed to fall under the purview of the FTC alone, lending heightened seriousness to the review. The full extent of actions from either agency, however, remains largely open-ended, and it’s possible both agencies may pursue separate probes into the same companies.

News of the DOJ’s move comes less than two weeks after the FTC fined Facebook for $5 billion over its handling of the Cambridge Analytica scandal—a wrist slap congressional Democrats found woefully inadequate—and hours after the Washington Post reported the agency had approved unprecedented oversight measure over Facebook’s privacy policies.

According to the Wall Street Journal, the DOJ has already held closed-door hearings to receive testimony from critics of Facebook.

“If violations of law are identified,” the DOJ wrote this afternoon, “the Department will proceed appropriately to seek redress,” which would include issues outside the scope of antitrust that are nonetheless discovered during the process of their research.

Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, and Facebook stocks all took a dip on release of the news and, if you listen closely with your ear towards the West coast, you can hear the sound of a thousand buttholes clenching."
Ethics Office Examines Allegations That Interior Dept. Officials Violated Transparency Laws,https://www.nytimes.com,['Coral Davenport'],07-23-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/23/climate/interior-department-freedom-of-information.html,"Mr. Trump’s first appointee to head the E.P.A., Scott Pruitt, and his first appointee to head the Interior Department, Ryan Zinke, resigned last year after thousands of pages of documents released under Freedom of Information Act requests raised questions about matters such Mr. Pruitt’s alleged spending abuses, first-class travel and relationships with lobbyists, and Mr. Zinke’s efforts to secure taxpayer-funded perks for his wife.

Both men have said that the criticism of their actions was politically and personally motivated, and that they did nothing wrong.

Last year, the Interior Department implemented a new “awareness policy” regarding requests for information and public records under the Freedom of Information Act. The new policy requires career staff reviewing such requests to notify politically appointed officials if their names or email addresses appear in documents that have been designated to be released.

That policy, watchdog groups say, has allowed top officials appointed by President Trump to then withhold or delay the release of such information. “The upshot is that, in practice, the policy has morphed from a procedure that provides awareness to political appointees to one that allows political appointees to unlawfully withhold and delay documents,” said Travis Annatoyn, senior counsel at Democracy Forward, a watchdog group that has requested an Interior Department investigation into the matter.

A spokeswoman for the Interior Department, Molly Block, declined to comment and referred to the Interior Department’s website, which includes a document describing the policy.

White House nixed DHS chief McAleenan Refugee Day border welcome for migrants,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-23-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/dhs-chief-mcaleenan-wanted-to-visit-border-and-welcome-migrants-for-refugee-day-white-house-said-no,"The White House communications team and the Department of Homeland Security's acting secretary office engaged in a tense argument last month after acting Secretary Kevin McAleenan proposed traveling down to the U.S.-Mexico border on World Refugee Day to celebrate and welcome migrants, including those who entered illegally, two senior administration officials told the Washington Examiner.

A senior public affairs official at DHS asked the White House in early June for permission to go down to the southern border with Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar on June 20. One person identified the official as acting DHS Assistant Secretary of Public Affairs Andrew Meehan.

""The wildly off base proposal was met with immediate concern as not being thought through,"" one official told the Washington Examiner Monday evening.

A second official said the White House was concerned about the ""optics"" if two Cabinet officials were welcoming people who had illegally crossed into the country when President Trump has taken a hard stance against any type of illegal immigration, including against those who are seeking asylum on the southern border.

The DHS official trying to advance McAleenan's proposal refused to accept the White House's decision and ""sparred with"" several members of the White House strategic communications team, including then-director Mercedes Schlapp, over ""multiple contentious phone calls,"" the first source said. The second official said the fight lasted ""weeks.""

""The obvious glaring concern was that the border crisis was about migrants and asylums, not refugees, DHS disagreed,"" the first official wrote in a text, suggesting the the appearance would seem supportive of the people abusing the system instead of legitimate refugees.

The same official said Azar was not supportive of McAleenan's idea and was not planning to go along for the trip. The second official said Azar was on board, but added neither secretary ""understood the ramifications"" of such a trip.

The June 20 World Refugee Day celebration may not have been greenlighted but McAleenan did go to the border on that date. He flew with a Washington Post reporter on Thursday. It's not clear if Azar traveled down separately. An HHS spokeswoman would only say: ""In the past year and a half, Secretary Azar has visited numerous Office of Refugee Resettlement facilities and seen the quality of care provided to unaccompanied alien children.

DHS did not deny that McAleenan's office requested a trip on World Refugee Day and instead shared a schedule of events he took part in while on the border that day.

""On June 20, 2019, Acting Secretary McAleenan hosted the first ladies of Guatemala and Honduras for a tour of the Rio Grande Valley Border Patrol Sector,"" a DHS official wrote in an email Thursday. ""The trip included an overview of how transnational criminal and human smuggling organizations pair adult aliens with children they are not related to with the intent of posing as family units to help secure release into the U.S.""

The day after, June 21, the Washington Post published a story leaking confidential details of a nationwide Immigration and Customs Enforcement operation, which five current and former senior administration officials charged to the Washington Examiner that McAleenan leaked because he did not approve of the raids and sought to sabotage them.

""This is a DHS leadership team who has been at odds with the administration from the beginning. It’s a difference of world view,"" the first official said Monday.

The DHS Office of Inspector General has taken up the formal investigation into the leak of government information in late June, which forced ICE to call off a nationwide operation, the Washington Examiner was first to report.

The White House did not respond to a request for comment.

"The Justice Department’s new Big Tech investigation was announced with unusual fanfare, and some antitrust experts say it might not herald as big of a crackdown as it seems",https://www.businessinsider.com,['Troy Wolverton'],07-24-2019,2019,7,https://www.businessinsider.com/doj-unusual-antitrust-announcement-could-be-good-for-big-tech-2019-7,"The US Department of Justice's surprise press release Tuesday of its Big Tech investigation was designed to send a signal to a lot of groups — but tech companies were not really one of them.

The announcement was an unusually public performance by a federal regulator which typically prizes confidentiality in such matters. That's because it was basically a notice, intended particularly to a key figure in Congress, that the Justice Department will now be spearheading the antitrust investigations into the big tech companies, said David Balto, an antitrust lawyer in Washington D.C. with decades of experience working for and with competition regulators officials there.

For tech companies, the DOJs' announcement was if anything, a subtle indication that the government may not come down as hard on them as it might seem, he said.

""This is good news for the companies,"" Balto said.

That may seem a bit ironic, given the substance of the announcement. In its statement, the Justice Department said it would review the market power of the ""leading online platforms"" to see if they have thwarted competition or harmed consumers. The agency vowed to ""seek redress"" if it found violations, essentially threatening to sue the companies.

Read this: The Department of Justice just launched a broad probe into whether big tech companies like Amazon, Facebook, and others illegally harm competition

The announcement came as something of a surprise. Numerous reports have indicated that the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission were starting to look into the competitive practices of the big tech companies. But the agencies had declined to comment on the record for those reports. In fact, federal enforcement agencies rarely acknowledge ongoing investigations into particular people or companies.

The agency is likely responding to political pressure

Unusual as it was, the Justice Department's move didn't come out of nowhere. Political figures on the left and right, including senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders and President Donald Trump, have been calling for increased scrutiny of the market power of the big tech companies and even, in many cases, for breaking them up.

""There is enormous political pressure on the agencies in Washington to be seen as doing something about big tech,"" said Daniel Crane, a professor at the University of Michigan's law school who focuses on antitrust issues. He continued: ""This is their way of responding to the political pressure.""

But Balto thinks there something more going on. Last month, The Wall Street Journal reported that the FTC and the Justice Department had divvied up oversight over the tech giants. Under the agreement, the FTC was to get authority over Facebook and Amazon, while the Department of Justice would oversee Apple and Google parent Alphabet.

The problem with that arrangement was that Mike Lee, who serves as chairman of Senate Judiciary Committee's subcommittee on antitrust, competition policy and consumer rights, objected to it, Balto noted. In an opinion piece published by the Washington Examiner last month, Lee lambasted the idea that the agencies would split oversight duties over the big tech companies. The two agencies risked duplicating efforts and causing a divergence in enforcement, he said.

""These investigations will clearly cover much of the same ground,"" Lee said in his op-ed. ""Splitting antitrust investigations of these firms between two agencies,"" he continued, ""is just analytically inefficient.""

The Justice Department is saying it's in charge

Lee's subcommittee was scheduled to hold a hearing on Tuesday with top antitrust regulators in the Trump administration at which he was expected to question them over the decision to split up oversight of the tech companies. That hearing ended up being postponed, but, in Balto's view, the Justice Department's announcement was its way of responding to Lee's concerns by staking out its turf.

""This is really the (Justice Department) saying, 'thank you, it's my football, and I plan to play with it,'"" he said.

The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that the Justice Department's review would not pre-empt the investigations already underway by the FTC into the companies under its purview.

Balto says that while the Justice Department may leave some issues to the FTC, Tuesday's announcement indicates that the DOJ is laying claim to all inquiries involving online platform and marketplace issues — the core of the antitrust charges made against the big tech companies. Senator Elizabeth Warren and others have raised concerns about how those companies use their control over their platforms and marketplaces to give their own products and services a leg up over rivals.

""These issues are incredibly complex, time consuming, and really difficult, and to have two agencies looking at the same conduct really didn't make sense,"" Balto said.

Lee's office did not respond to calls or an email seeking comment. Likewise, the Justice Department did not respond to an email seeking comment.

The move could be good news for the tech giants

The news that the Justice Department was opening up its review was seen as a negative sign on Wall Street Tuesday. The big four companies' stock prices all fell following the announcement.

But having the Justice Department take point on antitrust review is actually a good thing for the tech companies, Balto said. The Department of Justice hasn't filed a major suit under the Sherman Antitrust Act since the Microsoft case two decades ago. And the agency actually has fewer legal options when it comes to policing competition than does the FTC, he said.

""I don't think anybody's going to lose any more sleep that this is all with the Justice Department,"" Balto said. ""If anything, they'll feel more comfortable in their legal position.""

For his part, Crane is dubious that anything much will come of the investigations in the near future, regardless of which agency is leading the charge. When it comes to antitrust enforcement, the FTC's track record is not much better than the Department of Justice in recent decades, despite theoretically having enhanced enforcement powers, he said.

The courts have made it difficult for regulators to win antitrust cases, and even when such cases are successful, they tend to take many years to play out. Because of that, there's little chance the big tech companies will be broken up anytime soon, despite the political pressure on them, he said.

""The kind of blockbuster, 'let's break them up' case that is being trumpeted politically, I just don't see that being in the offing,"" Crane said.

‘It’s a disaster over there’: Commerce reaches new heights of dysfunction,https://www.politico.com,['Daniel Lippman'],07-22-2019,2019,7,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/07/22/wilbur-ross-commerce-department-dysfunction-1424427,"Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross doesn’t hold routine meetings with senior staffers, according to a person familiar with the department’s inner workings, ""Because he tends to fall asleep in meetings."" | Win McNamee/Getty Images Finance & Tax ‘It’s a disaster over there’: Commerce reaches new heights of dysfunction Under Secretary Wilbur Ross, the department is chaotic and adrift.

Constant infighting among top officials. Sudden departures of senior staffers without explanation. A leader who is disengaged and prone to falling asleep in meetings.

The Commerce Department has reached its apex of dysfunction under Wilbur Ross, according to four people with knowledge of the inner workings of the department. The 81-year-old Commerce secretary, who has for months endured whispers that he is on the outs, spends much of his time at the White House to try to retain President Donald Trump’s favor, the sources said, leaving his department adrift.

Story Continued Below

He’s hardly the only top Trump official to seek the president’s approval. But department insiders say they’ve rarely seen Commerce so rudderless — and they say Ross’ penchant for managing upward at the expense of his staff is leading to what one plugged-in observer described as “a disaster over there.”

“With our ongoing trade wars and the census looming, Commerce needs functional leadership to be effective, and right now they just don’t have it,” said Theo LeCompte, a former top Commerce official in the Obama administration who speaks often with former colleagues.

One common complaint: Ross, a successful investor before Trump tapped him as secretary of Commerce, isn’t frequently seen in the building talking to employees or rallying them to do good work.

“He’s sort of seen as kind of irrelevant. The morale is very low there because there’s not a lot of confidence in the secretary,” said a former outside adviser to Commerce who is still in touch with many employees at the department. “He’s not respected in the building.”

Ross doesn’t hold routine meetings with senior staffers, according to a person familiar with the department’s inner workings and a former outside adviser — a departure from past practice that one source attributed to the secretary’s lack of stamina.

“Because he tends to fall asleep in meetings, they try not to put him in a position where that could happen so they’re very careful and conscious about how they schedule certain meetings,” said the former outside adviser. “There’s a small window where he’s able to focus and pay attention and not fall asleep.”

A Commerce official disputed that criticsm, saying that Ross has frequent afternoon meetings, including “long” meetings on the census.

“Secretary Ross is a tireless worker who is the sole decision-maker at the department,"" said Commerce press secretary Kevin Manning. ""He routinely works 12-hour days and travels often, with visits to seven countries and eight states in the last three months to advance the president’s agenda.""

Yet top Commerce officials have pushed to not have Ross called to testify at congressional oversight hearings, according to two sources close to the department, because they fear he isn’t up to the task. “There’s a great deal of effort to shield him from testifying ever again,” said one of the sources.

A Commerce official disputed that and said, “He’s obviously going to have to testify again. … You can’t get through the rest of [congressional appropriations] season without testifying again.”

Ross did testify at an oversight hearing on the census for nearly seven hours in March, and emerged through the ordeal generally unscathed. But according to one person familiar with the department, the consensus among the top ranks of the administration was that it would be best to avoid a repeat appearance.

“There was a great deal of concern to not have him testify expressed from the White House,” this person said, characterizing the instructions as: “‘Don’t do this, people. Don’t do this, he’s probably not the right guy to go there.’”

Ross certainly has other reasons to avoid Congress — namely, the heated dispute between Hill Democrats and the administration over adding a citizenship question to the 2020 census.

In April, Ross offered to send aides to testify on his behalf before a House Appropriations subcommittee, an offer the panel’s Democratic chairman, José Serrano, said showed “stunning disrespect.” Serrano’s Republican counterpart, Robert Aderholt, told Reuters that Ross refused to testify out of “concern that this hearing might focus more on political or legal issues than the budget itself.”

“His relationship with the Hill has deteriorated more and more, and he’s just not interested in dealing with the Hill if he can avoid it,” said a person familiar with the department’s internal discussions.

A Commerce official noted that Ross talked to Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) two weeks ago, and held a party two months ago that a number of senators attended. Another Commerce employee observed, “This administration is very hesitant to do oversight in general or to comply with oversight requests in general.”

There are public signs, however, of apparent unease with Ross as a spokesperson for the administration. At an appearance at the White House in mid-July on an announcement on abandoning the citizenship question in the census, the Commerce secretary stood next to Trump the entire time and was one of three people who didn’t speak. Attorney General Bill Barr, on the other hand, spoke at length.

Ross’ relationship with the White House and with Trump was also damaged by stories that came out in the past 18 months showing that he wasn’t as rich as he had claimed and hadn’t fully divested some stock as he had promised, according to the former outside adviser. (The Commerce official disputed that, arguing that the White House has not cared about these issues.)

Ross’s deputies, meanwhile, are coming under fire of their own as tensions rise withini the department.

Political appointees sometimes close doors right in front of career employees to keep them out of meetings, one former Commerce official in touch with former colleagues said.

Meanwhile, “it’s totally infighting among the politicals,” said another person familiar with the department. “It’s just everybody fighting everybody.” In particular, the relationship between Ross’ office and the legislative affairs team is “clearly broken,” this person said.

Charles “Kolo” Rathburn, who had been acting head of legislative affairs, “was unceremoniously let go” and abruptly left earlier in July, according to a person familiar with Commerce and the outside adviser, who said it had to do with issues of professional conduct in the workplace. Another person familiar with Commerce also confirmed his departure.

“He wasn’t allowed to clean out his office,” said one of the people. Rathburn had replaced Mike Platt, who had left in early May.

A Commerce official said Rathburn, who didn’t respond to requests for comment, is working to pass the bar exam and has an offer for a higher-paying position at a law firm if he does.

Ross Branson, who had been deputy assistant secretary of legislative affairs and was Platt’s deputy, also left Commerce on Friday, according to two people familiar with his departure. He had become “collateral damage,” according to one of the people, and was told that he had to look for a new job. He starts on Monday as head of legislative affairs at the Export-Import Bank, a position that a Commerce official described as “definitely a promotion.” Branson and the Ex-Im Bank did not respond to a request for comment.

Much of the tension inside the building has centered on Earl Comstock, who shepherded Ross’ confirmation on Capitol Hill and is one of the secretary’s top lieutenants as the department's policy director.

The disarray inside Commerce is drawing an intervention from chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and other White House officials, who are trying to figure out how to wrest control from Comstock, who increasingly seems to be involved in everything that happens inside the department.

“Things come to a screeching halt because he demands to be the final decision on everything whether it’s an email that goes out to the Hill or a letter to respond to X, Y and Z,” said a person familiar with Commerce.

Comstock, who didn’t respond to requests for comment, has also been at the center of many of the spectrum battles between the Federal Communications Commission and the departments of Transportation, Education, Commerce and NASA and NOAA, according to an administration official. He has “literally been seeding bad intel and bad information to get other people agitated,” said the official.

He also tried to scuttle a joint White House-FCC summit on 5G, the wireless technology, in April by “calling everyone he could 24 hours before the event trying to get it to be canceled,” this person said. Comstock clashed in particular with former National Telecommunications and Information Administration chief David Redl, who left his post abruptly in May.

Critics of Ross’ leadership at Commerce also have a new target of concern: chief of staff Michael Walsh, who is described by some as inexperienced on policy and difficult to work with.

Walsh didn’t respond to a request for comment, but the Commerce official said that he has good relationships throughout the administration and on the Hill and visits the White House frequently. A second person familiar with Commerce also claimed, “People want his job so they’re spreading bad stuff on him.”

The chaos inside the department has had consequences for some employees.

“There’s great frustration among people who really want to use their skills and talents to help this country and are being marginalized by a White House who doesn’t need to ask any questions because it already thinks it has the answers,” said Roger Fisk, a Commerce official in the Obama administration. “All of that expertise is just lying dormant hiding in plain sight.""

Lindsey Graham says his 'deep dive' investigation of DOJ and FBI will include Papadopoulos testimony,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-24-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/lindsey-graham-says-his-deep-dive-investigation-of-doj-and-fbi-will-include-papadopoulos-testimony,"Republican South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham said Tuesday that his “deep dive” into the origins of the Trump-Russia investigation would include testimony from former Trump campaign associate George Papadopoulos, whose interactions with the mysterious Joseph Mifsud allegedly led to the FBI opening an inquiry into Trump in July 2016.

Papadopoulos was swept up in special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation, and he ultimately pleaded guilty about lying to investigators.

Graham, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said his committee “will be looking at the counterintelligence investigation of the Trump campaign.”

“We will call Papadopoulos and we will find out what happened,” Graham promised.

Graham said he would wait until the completion of the investigation by Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz into possible abuse of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. The allegations of abuse are related to the Justice Department and the FBI using a salacious and unverified dossier compiled by British ex-spy Christopher Steele to surveil a member of the Trump campaign.

Steele had been hired by the opposition research firm Fusion GPS, which itself had been hired by the Clinton campaign and the DNC through the Perkins Come law firm, facts which were not revealed to the FISA Court.

Trump granted Attorney General William Barr broad declassification authority, and Barr selected U.S. Attorney John Durham to be his right-hand man in a separate inquiry into why and how the Justice Department and the FBI launched an investigation into Trump.

“We’ll wait on Mr. Horowitz to do his report about the FISA warrant abuse,” Graham said. “But we’ll take a deep dive into the 2016 surveillance by the FBI and other organizations and campaigns to make sure we know what we’re doing and that there are protocols in place to ensure that we don’t play politics with the law.”

In recent days, Graham has been shedding more light on what his own follow-up investigation is going to look like, saying last week that he had questions for former FBI Director James Comey about his handling of the dossier, for former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe about the importance of the dossier in the FISA applications, and for Papadopoulos about whether he was really trying to make inroads with the Russians.

Papadopoulos pleaded guilty in October 2017 to making false statements to the FBI about his contacts with Mifsud and served just 12 days in federal prison late last year. He is now on supervised release.

""I’m going to deep-dive into how this stuff started,” Graham said last weekend. “How could it go so far if there was no collusion?” Graham said that the probe by the Justice Department and the FBI into possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia that began under President Obama was a “politicized investigation.”"
USDA rule could affect 3.1M food stamp recipients,https://abcnews.go.com,['Abc News'],,,,https://abcnews.go.com/Lifestyle/wireStory/usda-rule-affect-31m-food-stamp-recipients-64508284,"About 3.1 million people would lose food stamp benefits under the Trump administration's proposal to tighten automatic eligibility requirements for the food stamp program.

The Agriculture Department said Tuesday that the rule would close ""a loophole"" that enables people receiving only minimal benefits from the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program to be eligible automatically for food stamps without undergoing further checks on their income or assets.

""For too long, this loophole has been used to effectively bypass important eligibility guidelines. Too often, states have misused this flexibility without restraint,"" Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said in a statement.

The proposed rule is the latest in the Trump administration's efforts to cut back on the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program or SNAP, the official name of the food stamp program. It also has proposed to tighten work requirements for those who receive federal food assistance.

USDA estimates that 1.7 million households — 3.1 million people — ""will not otherwise meet SNAP's income and asset eligibility prerequisites under the proposed rule."" That would result in a net savings of about $9.4 billion over five years.

An unpublished version of the proposed rule acknowledges the impact, saying it ""may also negatively impact food security and reduce the savings rates among those individuals who do not meet the income and resource eligibility requirements for SNAP or the substantial and ongoing requirements for expanded categorical eligibility.""

Democrats in Congress were quick to condemn the proposal.

House Speaker Nancy Pelsoi said it was ""the administration's latest act of staggering callousness"" while Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said he would ""fight to make sure these cuts never become a reality.""

Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., said the administration was trying anew to circumvent Congress and that the effect would be to ""take food away from families, prevent children from getting school meals, and make it harder for states to administer food assistance.""

Congress has rejected previous, similar attempts to change the expanded automatic eligibility provisions, most recently during the farm bill debate in 2018.

Robert Greenstein, president of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said the proposal could discourage working families with incomes close to the maximum for SNAP participation from seeking more work out of fear that the added wages could make them ineligible for the program.

""The proposed rule would weaken SNAP's role in supporting work while making it harder for families that struggle to get by on low wages to meet their basic needs,"" he said.

About 36 million people participated in SNAP in April 2019, down from more than 38 million a year earlier.

Under current law, states may automatically make people eligible for food stamps, if they meet income and other requirements for TANF. USDA says 43 states have expanded that to include households that it says ""barely participate"" in TANF. The provision is called ""expanded categorical eligibility.""

USDA said the policy has resulted in people receiving food stamps who don't need it and wouldn't qualify under regular program rules.

Ellen Vollinger, legal director of the Food Research & Action Center, said the proposal was troubling and that the government should ""put attention on how to help more people, not undercut supports for them and make their struggle against hunger even harder.""

She said the department didn't seem to address a resulting loss of school meals, which she said the Congressional Budget Office included in its analyses of previous, similar proposals. ""It's another hit on hunger,"" she said.

Under the proposal, to qualify for automatic eligibility, people would have to get at least $50 a month in benefits from TANF for a minimum of six months.

Perdue said the change is necessary for ""preventing abuse of a critical safety net system so those who need food assistance the most are the only ones who receive it.""

The rule, expected to be published in the Federal Register on Wednesday, is open for public comment for 60 days.

State Department yanks data on U.S. tourists harmed in Jamaica,https://www.freep.com,"['Tresa Baldas', 'Published A.M. Et July']",07-23-2019,2019,7,https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/detroit/2019/07/23/state-department-american-tourists-jamaica/1796973001/,"CLOSE

At a time when tourism fears have escalated in the Caribbean, the State Department has stopped publishing crime data involving Americans harmed in Jamaica — but it won't say why.

For the first time in seven years, the State Department did not list how many Americans were sexually assaulted, robbed, murdered or kidnapped in Jamaica in its 2019 Crime and Safety Report. That information was previously published in reports that were cited in a 2018 Free Press investigation, which found that sexual assaults of U.S. tourists in Jamaica is an historic and unchecked problem, with an estimated one American raped a month.

That's according to State Department data that was publicly available for seven straight years — until now.

The Free Press, which interviewed numerous U.S. victims who said they were sexually assaulted in Jamaica, including four Michigan tourists, asked the State Department multiple times why the 2019 report omits data involving American crime victims in Jamaica. The agency wouldn't explain, beyond saying: “We do not have any other information to share at this time.""

These are the choke marks that an 18-year-old South African au pair says she suffered after being drugged and raped at a Sandals-owned beaches resort in Jamaica on July 4, 2018. She says Sandals paid her American host family $25,000 and silenced them with a non-disclosure agreement (Photo: South African au pair)

But the State Department did warn in its 2019 report that ""rape and sexual assault are serious problems throughout Jamaica, including at resorts and hotels. The use of date rape drugs is possible, even at private parties and resorts.""

The Jamaica 2019 Crime and Safety Report was released in the wake of a tourism scare involving the Dominican Republic, where 10 American tourist deaths have been reported since May. Several more U.S. tourists have reported becoming severely ill while on vacation there, including a Detroit man who landed in Harper Hospital's ICU following his May vacation to the DR.

Jamaica and the Dominican Republic are among nine Caribbean and Central American destinations that the U.S. State Department has issued Level 2 travel advisories for, citing violence and crime. Level 2 means “Exercise Increased Caution.” The other countries on the Level 2 travel advisory list are: The Bahamas, Belize, Colombia, Cuba, Turks and Caicos, Mexico and Guatemala.

There are four categories of travel advisories: “Level 1: Exercise Normal Precautions”; “Level Two: Exercise Increased Caution”; “Level 3: Reconsider Travel” and “Level 4: Do Not Travel.”

Caribbean destinations that are currently deemed safe for travel — they have no travel advisory — include:

Anguilla, Antigua, Aruba, Barbados, Bonaire

British Virgin Islands

Cayman Islands

Costa Rica, Curaçao, Grenada

French West Indies, which include Guadeloupe, Martinique, French Saint Martin, and Saint Barthélemy.

Saint Kitts and Nevis

Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines

Countries on the “Level 3, Reconsider Travel” list are:

El Salvador

Honduras

Nicaragua

Haiti

Countries on the “Level 4, Do Not Travel” list are:

Venezuela

While the FBI investigates the Dominican Republic deaths, tourism officials there are working feverishly to dispel concerns about travel safety. So are officials in Jamaica, where an island-wide security audit of resorts was ordered in the wake of the Free Press investigation, which detailed the rapes of two Detroit women who were attacked at gunpoint by a Jamaican resort employee last fall.

Jamaica's Minister of Tourism Edmund Bartlett said in early July that the months-long security audit is complete and that his office is reviewing it. Findings have not yet been released.

“The issue of safety and security is very central to us. We will have further discussions with the (Jamaica Hotel and Tourist Association) as it relates to the recommendations, and together we will craft the new architecture in Jamaica,” Bartlett said at a June tourism meeting.

The audit sought to uncover, among other things, non-compliance by resorts regarding safety incidents. It focused on building safety, personnel, security measures, communication devices and security incident history.

Meanwhile, State Department warnings about sexual violence against women tourists in Jamaica continue.

""If you are a victim of a sexual assault, contact the police and the U.S. Embassy in Kingston as soon as possible,"" the State Department states in its 2019 report, reminding victims that Jamaican hotels and resorts ""should assist you with these communications.""

That message highlighted a key finding in the Free Press investigation.

Numerous victims told the Free Press the resorts ignored or downplayed their fears, discouraged them from going to the police, and in some cases silenced them with free travel in exchange for them signing non-disclosure agreements.

The 2019 State Department report also highlighted this finding by the Free Press: tourists who are sexually assaulted in Jamaica feel justice is out of reach. As one mother told the Free Press three years after her daughter was allegedly raped in a laundry room by a resort lifeguard: ""My daughter will never have justice.""

CLOSE The rapes of two Detroit women at a Jamaican resort has highlighted a pervasive problem on the island getaway: sexual assaults are ignored. Tresa Baldas, Detroit Free Press

Four and a half years after the alleged rapes of the girl and her friend, the case is finally going to trial in Jamaica in December. The victims will testify from a location in the U.S.

The State Department warns about such delays.

""Victims of sexual assault in Jamaica should not expect the same assistance routinely offered in the United States,"" the State Department writes in its 2019 report. ""Rape kits are not always available, and victims must often ask for medication to avoid STD transmission and reduce the chances of pregnancy. An offer of counseling is unlikely.""

Police resources are also limited, the government says.

""Law enforcement shortcomings exist in collection of evidence. Prosecution of rape cases moves very slowly,"" the State Department states, adding: ""Victims may need to return to Jamaica during the legal process.""

"Brooklyn man accused of immigration fraud, submitting hundreds of faked applications: DOJ",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Bradford Betz', 'Bradford Betz Is An Editor For Fox News. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/brooklyn-man-accused-of-immigration-fraud-submitting-hundreds-of-faked-applications-doj,"A New York City man was arrested Tuesday for allegedly running an immigration fraud scheme that involved filing over 1,800 fake immigration applications over the past four years, according to a press release from the Department of Justice’s office in Vermont.

Brooklyn resident Arleigh Louison, 53, was arrested by Diplomatic Security Service (DSS) agents who executed a federal search warrant at his office, the press release said.

Louison’s arrest comes less than a week after a federal grand jury returned a 12-count indictment, charging him with presenting false adjustment of status petitions to the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services Service Center in St. Albans, Vt.

The Office of the United States Attorney for the District of Vermont, which conducted the probe, said Louison made false statements in connection with Form I-360 petitions for status adjustments under the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), a law that enables immigrants to become lawful permanent residents (LPRs) of the U.S. if they were abused by a relative who is a U.S. citizen or LPR.

Louison allegedly submitted false information in the VAWA petitions so petitioners could secure work authorization permits. Last week’s indictment charged that the petitioners – who paid Louison for his services – were not abused as described in the petitions and never discussed abuse with Louison.

ICE ANNOUNCES HUNDREDS OF MIGRANTS ARRESTED IN RAID OPERATIONS

The U.S. Attorney’s Office in Vermont said that Louison filed false statements with the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, including more than 1,800 fraudulent applications for over 1,000 petitioners in the last four years.

WASHINGTON — The Environmental Protection Agency’s inspector general will investigate allegations that William L. Wehrum, the agency’s former air quality chief, violated ethics rules when he met with former clients from his days as a lawyer and lobbyist for the oil, gas and coal industries.

The inquiry will look into whether Mr. Wehrum’s efforts at the E.P.A. to weaken climate change and air pollution standards improperly benefited those former clients, a congressional aide said .

At issue are Mr. Wehrum’s ties to the Utility Air Regulatory Group, a coalition of utilities and trade groups that lobbies on behalf of coal-fired power plants, which he represented as a lawyer at his former firm, Hunton & Williams.

That relationship first drew scrutiny last year after Politico reported that the 25 power companies and six trade groups that make up the coalition paid the firm more than $8 million in 2017 just before President Trump appointed Mr. Wehrum. (The law firm is now known as Hunton Andrews Kurth. The Utility Air Regulatory Group announced in May that it would disband after winding down operations.)"
AG Barr's promise to probe Big Tech does the unthinkable — unites Democrats and Republicans,https://www.cnbc.com,['Jennifer Elias'],07-23-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/23/ag-barrs-promise-to-probe-big-tech-unites-democrats-and-republicans.html,"President Donald Trump delivers his State of the Union address to a joint session of the U.S. Congress on Capitol Hill January 30, 2018 in Washington, DC.

Only Big Tech could bring together Bill Barr and Elizabeth Warren.

Republicans and Democrats alike are doubling down on their criticism of Big Tech after U.S. Attorney General William Barr announced late Tuesday that the Department of Justice will open a broad antitrust review of big tech companies. He didn't name names, but shares of Amazon, Alphabet and Facebook traded lower on the news.

As the 2020 Presidential elections get closer and the Democratic candidates gear up for their second debate next week, criticism of Big Tech runs across the aisle — even if the specifics differ. The most outspoken Democrats primarily argue that the big platforms stifle fair competition, while Republicans have loudly complained about anti-conservative bias.

""They're politically caught in the crosshairs,"" said Brian Yacktman, founder of YCG Investments, which oversees over $750 million and owns shares of Facebook and Alphabet. ""What's bipartisan is that people are concerned about companies having too much power and too much control over data so they want regulation.""

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) are among those with divergent views on practically everything, except when it comes to criticizing Big Tech. Politicians were quick to express their views after Tuesday's DOJ announcement.

""Big tech companies like Amazon, Facebook, and Google wield enormous, monopolistic power,"" Elizabeth Warren tweeted following Barr's statement. ""I've been saying that we need to #BreakUpBigTech for a long time and I support a legitimate antitrust investigation into these companies.""

Another presidential candidate, Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), reacted to the DOJ investigation stating, ""For some time, I have been calling on the antitrust agencies to look into anticompetitive practices by the large online platforms as well as for increased transparency.""

Klobuchar is also a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy and Consumer Rights. ""The American people deserve to know whether these tech giants are unlawfully stifling competition and how our laws and enforcers can encourage innovation while protecting consumers,"" she added.

On the Republican side, Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri thanked Barr for following through with promises he made to look into big tech companies at his confirmation hearings earlier this year.

""In January, AG Barr gave me his commitment that he would take Big Tech antitrust concerns seriously,"" Hawley wrote. ""Glad to see he's following through.""

Senator Mark Warner (D-Virginia), a former venture capitalist, said that while he supports fair competition among businesses, ""The mission of the Justice Department is fact-based, and I hope that its review will be driven by facts and the dynamics of these markets, rather than by outside political considerations.""

Silicon Valley antitrust lawyer Gary Reback, who spearheaded efforts that led to the government's case against Microsoft in the 1990s, told CNBC last month that wide-ranging skepticism has left big tech companies like Google without political shelter.

""I've been taking companies to Washington where they've complained about Google for a long time and there were politicians blocking it once, but the blockers aren't there anymore,"" he said.

Daniel Ives, managing director of equity research for Wedbush Securities, echoed that sentiment.

""Big Tech already has a bullseye on its back from both sides of the aisle going into the 2020 elections so the rhetoric is only going to continue to increase,"" he said.

Tech stocks are falling in after-hours trading on Tuesday, on news that the government is going to pursue a broad antitrust inquiry into the sector.

The Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (ticker: XLK) is down 0.2% in after-hours trading after gaining 0.6% in regular market hours. Facebook (FB) has fallen 1.3% to $199.65, while Apple (AAPL) is off 0.6% to $207.70, Amazon.com (AMZN) is 1% lower to $1,975, Netflix (NFLX) is down 0.3% to $306.27, and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) has dropped 1.1% to $1,135.

Editor's Choice

The Justice Department is opening a review of big tech firms from e-commerce to social media, as it seeks to determine whether or not these companies are unlawfully using their clout to stifle competition, officials in the agency told The Wall Street Journal on Tuesday afternoon. (Google was previously in the spotlight following unconfirmed reports that it was the target of a DoJ review at the end of May.)"
"DOJ Probing Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon",https://www.investopedia.com,['Mark Kolakowski'],07-24-2019,2019,7,https://www.investopedia.com/doj-antitrust-probe-of-big-tech-4694494,"The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has announced that it is ""reviewing the practices of market-leading online platforms,"" with a view towards determining whether they have ""reduced competition, stifled innovation, or otherwise harmed consumers."" The DOJ press release indicates that they are responding to ""widespread concerns that consumers, businesses, and entrepreneurs have expressed about search, social media, and some retail services online.""

Goal of the Review

The goal of this review is to ""assess the competitive conditions in the online marketplace...and to ensure that Americans have access to free markets in which companies compete on the merits to provide services that users want.""

Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim of the Antitrust Division provided this quote for the press release: ""Without the discipline of meaningful market-based competition, digital platforms may act in ways that are not responsive to consumer demands.""

The DOJ says that it will ""seek redress"" for any violations of law, without offering any further specifics.

Likely Targets

The DOJ press release does not mention specific companies, but its language suggests that the key targets of this review are likely to be among the mega cap FAANG members. Facebook Inc. (FB) is the leader in social media, Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) is the preeminent online retailer, and the Google division of Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) is by far the dominant search engine. Apple Inc. (AAPL), meanwhile, has been mentioned in various press reports as another likely target.

Double Trouble

The DOJ already has been partnering with Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in reviewing competitive practices in the tech industry, with an eye towards possible antitrust violations, per an earlier report in Barron's. According to that article, the FTC is taking the lead on Amazon.com and Facebook, while the DOJ leads on Apple and Alphabet.

However, the current announcement from the DOJ seems to be ratcheting up the pressure on the tech giants, The Wall Street Journal reports. It now seems possible that a given company may face antitrust actions launched by both the DOJ and the FTC, greatly increasing the potential penalties. Meanwhile, executives from these same tech giants testified last week before a U.S. House of Representatives subcommittee on antitrust matters.

Calls For Breakup

All four FAANG members mentioned above have been under fire from various quarters for allegedly monopolistic practices. In a recent ""private presentation"" to the DOJ, critics of Facebook, including some academics, reportedly argued that the company should be broken up, per the Journal. Google and Amazon also have faced calls for breakup at various times in recent years, from various constituencies."
DOJ opens antitrust inquiry into top tech companies,https://thehill.com,[],07-23-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/policy/technology/454392-doj-opens-antitrust-inquiry-into-top-tech-companies,"The Department of Justice (DOJ) on Tuesday announced it is launching an investigation into whether the country's largest tech companies have stifled competition or harmed consumers, marking the department's widest-ranging inquiry into potential tech antitrust violations yet.

The DOJ's antitrust division is leading the probe, surveying ""whether and how market-leading online platforms have achieved market power and are engaging in practices that have reduced competition, stifled innovation, or otherwise harmed consumers,"" the DOJ said in a statement.

The inquiry emerges as Silicon Valley is facing intensifying scrutiny from Washington, including looming record penalties from federal regulators and a separate antitrust investigation by bipartisan House lawmakers.

Facebook, Google and Amazon — some of the largest and most powerful tech companies in the world — could all be implicated in the DOJ's probe.

The department will ""consider the widespread concerns that consumers, businesses, and entrepreneurs have expressed about search, social media, and some retail services online,"" according to the statement.

Google dominates global search services, Facebook owns three of the top social media platforms, and Amazon is a leading player in online retail.

“Without the discipline of meaningful market-based competition, digital platforms may act in ways that are not responsive to consumer demands,” Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim, who helms the antitrust division, said in a statement. “The Department’s antitrust review will explore these important issues.”

Delrahim, who will head the investigation, lobbied on Google's behalf in 2007 when it was facing antitrust scrutiny over its acquisition of DoubleClick, a top online advertising company that has boosted the company's dominance in digital ads. Delrahim reported a $100,000 paycheck from Google that year.

He also lobbied on behalf of Apple in 2006 and 2007 on patent reform.

Delrahim's former lobbying credentials have prompted some Democratic lawmakers, including 2020 contender Sen. Elizabeth Warren Elizabeth Ann Warren Ocasio-Cortez about as well known as top Democrats: poll Warren presses Pelosi on impeachment: 'Some things are above politics' Overnight Defense: Esper sworn in as Pentagon chief | Confirmed in 90-8 vote | Takes helm as Trump juggles foreign policy challenges | Senators meet with woman accusing defense nominee of sexual assault MORE (D-Mass.), to call for him to recuse himself from any tech probes.

Reports over the past several months have indicated the DOJ and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) divvied up oversight of the country's largest tech giants in preparation for potential investigations into the companies' enormous market power.

Amazon declined to comment on the DOJ antitrust probe.

A Google spokesperson pointed The Hill to recent testimony by Adam Cohen, Google's director of economic policy.

Testifying before the House Judiciary Committee earlier this month, Cohen argued that Google has helped create competition. ""In the face of intense competition, we are proud of our record of continued innovation,"" Cohen told lawmakers. ""We have created new competition in many sectors, and new competitive pressures often lead to concerns from rivals.""

Google dominates online search, holding about 92 percent of the world's search engine market share, according to some estimates.

Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

According to the DOJ, if investigators identify ""violations of law ... the Department will proceed appropriately to seek redress.""

A growing chorus of critics, including some lawmakers on Capitol Hill, have started to question whether the country's antitrust laws need to be updated to align with the changing online landscape.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced a new plan to eliminate automatic enrollment for those who are already part of other programs.

Right now, most states including Michigan, allow those who are part of some welfare programs to automatically enroll in the SNAP program.

The change could impact more than three million Americans.

""Any time there is limitations on the eligibility for the SNAP program, more people are removed from the program and then in need of food, and then they come to food pantries in our network,"" said Kait Skwir with the Food Bank Council of Michigan.

Because the information is so new, the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services doesn't have a number for how many people will be affected.

A spokesperson says it would likely be a small percent of the one million Michiganders in the program.

""These are people with incomes that are very close to the poverty threshold, and so their ability to save and move toward self-sufficiency is dramatically impacted by losing a benefit like food assistance,"" said Skwir.

The Michigan League for Public Policy, a nonpartisan group, says the change could also impact the economy.

""They're not buying things on Amazon. They're not paying off old credit card debt. What they're doing with those federal dollars is they are buying food from a local grocery store,"" said Peter Ruark with the Michigan League for Public Policy.

USDA officials say this will close a ""loophole"" that allows people to abuse the system.

In Michigan, that's about .3% of recipients, according to MDHHS.

""I don't think I would call this a loophole. We do have programs in place to find fraud when there's any fraud occurring with the food assistance program or other programs,"" said Bob Wheaton with MDHHS.

MDHHS Director Robert Gordon said, “Instead of supporting work, this proposal punishes full-time earners. Instead of targeting fraud and abuse, this proposal goes after families playing by all the rules. It is a radical break from a long-standing, bipartisan approach to food assistance.”

The Trump administration says this plan would save $2.5 billion.

Democrats press Trump Treasury picks on donor disclosure guidelines,https://thehill.com,[],07-24-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/policy/finance/454563-dems-press-treasury-nominees-on-guidance-reducing-donor-disclosure,"Democratic senators at a hearing on Wednesday pressed Treasury Department nominees on guidance the department issued last year reducing donor disclosure requirement for certain tax-exempt groups.

“This makes it easier for dark-money groups to be able to do their business in secret,” Senate Finance Committee ranking member Ron Wyden Ronald (Ron) Lee WydenOvernight Defense: Esper sworn in as Pentagon chief | Confirmed in 90-8 vote | Takes helm as Trump juggles foreign policy challenges | Senators meet with woman accusing defense nominee of sexual assault Hillicon Valley: DOJ opens tech antitrust probe | Facebook, Amazon set lobbying records | Barr attacks encryption as security risk | NSA to create new cybersecurity arm Overnight Health Care: Grassley gambles on drug price bill despite GOP doubts | Newly opened migrant children shelter could close this week | FDA warns company over CBD claims MORE (D-Ore.) said.

The Finance Committee held a hearing on four nominations to Treasury and tax court positions. These included the nominations of Brent McIntosh, the current Treasury general counsel, to be a Treasury undersecretary, and Brian Callanan, the current Treasury deputy general counsel, to succeed McIntosh as general counsel.

Democrats focused many of their questions to McIntosh and Callanan on the process Treasury undertook before issuing the donor disclosure guidance.

Under the guidance, which Treasury issued with the IRS, certain tax-exempt groups — including social-welfare organizations such as the National Rifle Association and the American Civil Liberties Union — will no longer be required to report the names and addresses of major donors on annual forms.

Republicans have said the guidance is important in order to protect taxpayers’ privacy and First Amendment rights. But Democrats have long taken issue with the guidance, which they say could make it easier for foreign government and “dark money” groups to influence U.S. elections. Last year, the Senate approved a resolution to overturn the guidance, though the House did not take it up.

Wyden and Sen. Maggie Hassan Margaret (Maggie) HassanFinding a path forward to end surprise medical billing Trump's new labor chief alarms Democrats, unions Second ex-Senate staffer charged in aiding doxxing of GOP senators MORE (D-N.H.) asked the Treasury nominees about the decision to not provide a comment period before issuing the donor guidance.

Hassan noted that two states, Montana and New Jersey, have challenged the guidance in court because there wasn’t a public notice and comment period. She argued that the guidance could make it harder for the government to go after pharmaceutical companies who funded nonprofits that provided fraudulent information about drug addiction.

“In effect, the Treasury has hamstrung law enforcement’s ability to follow the money and hold pharma accountable for fraud,” she said.

McIntosh said the IRS made the decision to issue the guidance without a notice and comment period. He said he was aware that the guidance was going to be issued but he didn’t decide that the guidance wouldn’t come in the form of a regulation.

McIntosh also said he thinks there is a “long tradition” of the IRS relieving reporting requirements without notice and comment.

Callanan said that other units at Treasury and the IRS first analyzed the guidance action, and that he reviewed their analysis and “was comfortable with the substantive and procedural legal considerations, that it was within the statutory authority.”

Sen. Bob Casey Robert (Bob) Patrick CaseyPennsylvania school district turns down local businessman's offer to pay off student lunch debts Democrats pledge to fight Trump detention policy during trip to border Democrats grill USDA official on relocation plans that gut research staff MORE Jr. (D-Pa.) asked the nominees if Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) was consulted before the guidance was issued.

Callanan said that FinCEN generally doesn’t make use of tax-return information, and that the legal path for FinCEN to access such information is “exceedingly narrow.” He said that he didn’t know if FinCEN was consulted but would look into it.

Callanan also said, in response to a letter Wyden and Casey sent to the IRS earlier this month, that lawyers for the IRS’s criminal tax function were consulted.

Catherine Cortez Masto Catherine Marie Cortez MastoMcConnell challenger faces tougher path after rocky launch The Hill's Morning Report - A raucous debate on race ends with Trump admonishment Democrat Sherrod Brown torches Facebook at hearing: They 'broke journalism,' 'helped incite a genocide' MORE (D-Nev.) asked if Treasury was lobbied to reduce tax-exempt groups’ donor disclosure requirements.

Callanan said he was aware of a public letter from a number of tax-exempt groups, and that there were a number of lawmakers who had asked about the issue, including Sen. Ron Johnson Ronald (Ron) Harold JohnsonGOP leaders struggle to contain conservative anger over budget deal Mystery surrounds elusive sanctions on Russia Trump may intervene in Pentagon cloud-computing contract: report MORE (R-Wis.).

Wyden said he has “deep concerns” about McIntosh and Callanan’s nominations because of their roles at Treasury when the donor guidance was issued and because of their involvement in Treasury’s rejection of House Democrats’ request for President Trump Donald John Trump Ocasio-Cortez about as well known as top Democrats: poll Protestor yelling about Trump Tower meeting thrown out of Mueller hearing Chris Wallace: 'This has been a disaster for the Democrats' and 'for the reputation of Robert Mueller' MORE’s tax returns.

Wyden had put a hold on the nominations in June, because he found Treasury’s responses to his questions about the handling of the tax return request unsatisfactory. Last week, Wyden announced that he would let the nominations move forward, after Treasury provided information that the senator said confirmed that the department’s actions are “unprecedented.”

“Mr. McIntosh and Mr. Callanan are currently the top lawyers at the Treasury Department,” Wyden said. “It has appeared that Treasury’s leadership is more interested in protecting Donald Trump and party interests than guaranteeing the department follows the law. So in my judgment, that’s not the kind of conduct that gets you a promotion.”"
"Some Alabama sheriffs give concealed gun permits without full background checks, DOJ says",https://www.al.com,"['Carol Robinson', 'Crobinson Al.Com']",07-24-2019,2019,7,https://www.al.com/news/birmingham/2019/07/some-alabama-sheriffs-give-concealed-gun-permits-without-full-background-checks-doj-says.html,"Some Alabama sheriffs have been issuing concealed carry permits to people without full background checks or even when the National Instant Criminal Background Check System denied the application, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives announced this week.

As a result, federally-licensed gun shops across Alabama can no longer accept a concealed carry permit as proof that a criminal background check has been done on a buyer.

Federal officials did not name the sheriffs who issued the permits.

As a result of the practice, authorities said, guns have been transferred to convicted felons and other prohibited buyers in violation of federal law, thereby creating “a substantial public safety concern.” They have not said how many guns may have been transferred to prohibited buyers.

The Brady Act, which took effect in November 1998, requires federal firearms licensees to conduct the NICS background check before selling a gun to an unlicensed person. The Brady Act, however, has exceptions to the NIC check requirement, including an exception for holders of certain state permits to possess, carry or acquire firearms.

In 2016, ATF informed all Alabama federal firearms licensees that under Alabama law, the states concealed carry permits issued on or after Aug. 1, 2013 qualified as an alternative to a NICS. ATF’s determination, authorities said, was based on the understanding that full NICS check would be conducted by the government agencies issued the concealed carry permits and that if the background check showed the person was prohibited form possession a firearm under federal or state law, the applicant would be denied a permit.

“Based on recent information received from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Criminal Justice Information Services Division Audit Unit, and upon results of inspections conducted by ATF field offices, ATF has determined that...CCP permits have been, and continue to be, issued to individuals without completion of a NICS check, or after a NICS denial,’’ according to the DOJ press release. “At least some of these permits were issued to felons and other federally prohibited persons who used them purchase firearms from Alabama FFLs without a NICS check.”

Additionally, ATF officials said, the determined that some Alabama counties – again they have not released the names of those counties – have not been requiring non-U.S. citizen concealed carry permit applicants to submit the necessary information for authorities to conduct an Immigration Alien Query.

The audit, authorities said, was done in 2018 and all Alabama gun shops have been notified of the change. “The concealed carry permit is still needed but is no longer accepted as a background check,’’ said ATF spokesman Michael Knight. “That’s the way it used to be and the way it is in most states.”

He said the threshold used by sheriff’s offices is different and not as extensive as the checks done by federal firearms licensees.

“The gun shops took the concealed carry permit (as proof of a background check) in a good faith,’’ Knight said. “In reality, the gun shops always had the option to run their own anyway.”

Knight said they don’t know the full extent of the lapse because “We don’t know how many guns out there that have not been recovered yet.”

Jefferson County sheriff’s spokesman Capt. David Agee said they do a complete background check on all permit applicants. ""Our process is complete,'' he said.

ATF officials, as well as Shane Thomas, general manager at Birmingham Pistol Wholesale, say the only change the buyers will see is perhaps a longer wait. “They may have to wait up to five days,’’ Thomas said. “There will be people who don’t understand but we’ll obey (the mandate) and move on.”

He said for the most part, using the concealed carry permit as a background check alternative was working but said the new mandate, “takes the guess work out of it.”

“It really doesn’t matter what we think,’’ Thomas said. “We’re going to do what we’re told to do.”"
State AGs say EPA violated law with fuel efficiency rollback,https://thehill.com,[],07-24-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/454591-state-ags-say-epa-violated-law-with-fuel-efficiency-rollback,"Several state attorneys general said the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) violated the law by informing them as it planned to scale back fuel efficiency requirements for vehicles.

The attorneys say an executive order from the Clinton administration requires the agency to consult with states before proposing standards that would freeze Obama-era fuel requirements for new vehicles.

“The Trump Administration is not only paving the way for polluters, it is doing so illegally. For decades, states have stepped up to protect our planet with cost-saving, pollution-fighting clean car regulations. Trump’s Administration wants to overturn these standards, and failed to follow basic accountability measures in proposing new rules,” New York Attorney General Leticia James said in a statement.

Some states have opposed to the Trump administration's fuel economy rollback because it would prevent them from adopting the stricter fuel efficiency standards currently allowed in California.

New York, along with 11 other states, say they discovered through a Freedom of Information Act request that the agency was discussing the rollback long before they were alerted and asked EPA to open the rule back up for comment.

“The FOIA responses now confirm that the agencies have not complied with the Executive Order. The agencies should accept this supplemental comment into their rulemaking dockets because the delay in submitting the comment is attributable entirely to the agencies’ late responses to the FOIA requests,” the states said in a letter to EPA.

An EPA spokesperson said the agency would respond to the letter through the proper channels.

“As the Administration has long stated, we are pursuing one national standard to provide safe, affordable vehicles for consumers while also improving environmental outcomes,"" the agency said in an email to The Hill.

The letter was signed by Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Vermont, and Washington in addition to New York."
Department of Labor Opinion: Driver Sleeper Berth Off-Duty Time Need Not Be Compensated,https://www.ttnews.com,"['Eric Miller', 'Staff Reporter']",07-23-2019,2019,7,https://www.ttnews.com/articles/department-labor-opinion-driver-sleeper-berth-duty-time-need-not-be-compensated,"[Stay on top of transportation news: Get TTNews in your inbox.]

The U.S. Department of Labor has clarified that the time drivers spend in sleeper berths does not count as compensable time, unless they are actually performing work or are on call.

The decision was outlined in an opinion letter, written July 22 by DOL Wage and Hour Division Administrator Cheryl Stanton, based on the federal Fair Labor Standards Act.

She said that past guidance by the department’s Wage and Hour Division has been “unnecessarily burdensome for employers.”

Stanton

Stanton wrote that her opinion “adopts a straightforward reading of the plain language under which the time drivers are relieved of all duties and permitted to sleep in a sleeper berth is presumptively non-duty sleeping time and non-working time when the employer permits the employee to sleep in adequate facilities.”

The presumption that nonworking time in which the employee is relieved of all duties is not compensable holds true regardless of whether the truck is moving or stationary, Stanton said.

American Trucking Associations said the opinion will help the industry better understand its compliance obligations prospectively, rather than settling such matters only after the fact through “costly and wasteful litigation.”

“ATA commends Acting Secretary [Patrick] Pizzella and Administrator Stanton for adopting a straightforward, plain-language reading of the law, rather than the burdensome alternative interpretation embraced by those outlier decisions,” Chris Spear, the federation’s president, said July 22.

“This opinion, which is consistent with decades-old DOL regulations, the weight of judicial authority, and the long understanding of the trucking industry, clears up confusion created by two recent court decisions that called the compensability of sleeper berth time into question.”

Spear was referring to previous court decisions by federal district judges in Arkansas and Arizona that truck drivers are entitled to compensation for time in the sleeper berth. However, those decisions were preceded by two federal cases that resulted in legal rulings more favorable for carriers, including one that was affirmed by an appeals court.

Pianka

“This isn’t a regulation. This is just agency guidance,” added Richard Pianka, ATA’s deputy general counsel. “This is DOL’s view of what the law means.”

However, Pianka told Transport Topics the opinion can be expected to be very influential in court challenges on driver sleeper-berth pay issues.

“A court does not have to give this dispositive weight,” Pianka said. “But they will give it serious consideration and they will not reject it out of hand.”

Pianka continued, “We’re hoping that this opinion letter will clear up the confusion and keep outliers confined, as opposed to spreading further, and that this wave of class-action liability will simmer down.”

Andy Scott, an attorney with Atlanta law firm Fisher & Phillips LLP, who does work for trucking companies, said these cases were just starting to gather strength.

“This new opinion is going to nip that trend in the bud,” he said. “It will probably make it easier to win the cases that are currently underway.”"
Justice Department Launches Antitrust Probe of Big Tech,https://www1.cbn.com,[],07-23-2019,2019,7,https://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/july/justice-department-launches-antitrust-probe-of-big-tech,"The U.S. Department of Justice opened a sweeping antitrust investigation of big technology companies and whether their online platforms have hurt competition, suppressed innovation or otherwise harmed consumers.

It comes as a growing number of lawmakers have called for stricter regulation or even breaking up of the big tech companies, which have come under intense scrutiny following a series of scandals that compromised users’ privacy.

President Donald Trump also has relentlessly criticized the big tech companies by name in recent months. He frequently asserts, without evidence, that companies such as Facebook and Google are biased against him and conservative politicians.

The Justice Department did not name specific companies in its announcement.

The focus of the investigation closely mirrors a bipartisan probe of Big Tech undertaken by the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust. Its chairman, Rep. David Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat, has sharply criticized the conduct of Silicon Valley giants and said legislative or regulatory changes may be needed. He has called breaking up the companies a last resort.

Major tech companies already facing that congressional scrutiny declined to comment on the Justice Department’s probe.

Amazon had no comment. Facebook also did not have an immediate comment.

Google directed requests for comments to the testimony its director of economic policy, Adam Cohen, made to the House Judiciary Committee last week. Cohen reiterated the company’s benefits to consumers.

Apple referred to comments from CEO Tim Cook, who told CBS last month he doesn’t think “anybody reasonable” would call Apple a monopoly.

Shares of Facebook, Amazon and Apple were down slightly in after-hours trading.

One antitrust expert believes the DOJ investigation may prompt regulators to interpret U.S. competition law in new ways.

University of Pennsylvania law professor Herbert Hovenkamp said the companies may have been their abusing market power by collectively buying hundreds of startups in recent years to devour their technology and prevent them from growing into formidable rivals.

Traditionally, antitrust regulators have only sought to block acquisitions involving large companies in adjacent markets. But Hovenkamp says U.S. antitrust law is broad enough for regulators to consider the potential damage wrought by relatively small deals, too.

Earlier, the Washington Post reported that the Federal Trade Commission will allege that Facebook misled users about its privacy practices as part of an expected settlement of its 2018 Cambridge Analytica scandal.

The federal business watchdog will reportedly find that Facebook deceived users about how it handled phone numbers it asked for as part of a security feature and provided insufficient information about how to turn off a facial recognition tool for photos.

Advertisers were reportedly able to target users who provided their phone number as part of a two-factor authentication security feature.

The FTC didn’t respond immediately to a request for comment.
