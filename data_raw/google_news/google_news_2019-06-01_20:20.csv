"The Supreme Court could intervene in attempt to remove Trump from office, Dershowitz says",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Sam Dorman', 'Sam Dorman Is A Reporter With Fox News. You Can Follow Him On Facebook']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/supreme-court-intervene-trump-office-dershowitz,"President Trump may succeed if he follows through on his attempt to take an impeachment attempt to the Supreme Court, Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz said on Friday.

""Our non-lawyer president may be closer to the truth than his lawyer critics,"" Dershowitz wrote in an op-ed published in The Hill.

Dershowitz, a Fox News contributor, was referring to responses to the president's tweet that he would take the issue to the nation's highest court.

""I DID NOTHING WRONG. If the partisan Dems ever tried to impeach, I would first head to the U.S. Supreme Court,"" Trump said in April.

ANDREW MCCARTHY: MUELLER PROBE WAS ALWAYS ABOUT IMPEACHMENT

Dershowitz, in his Friday op-ed, pointed to previous Supreme Court justices who indicated that the Supreme Court should intervene under certain circumstances.

“Finally, as applied to the special case of the President, the majority argument merely points out that, were the Senate to convict the President without any kind of trial, a Constitutional crisis might well result,"" former Supreme Court Justice Byron White said.

""It hardly follows that the Court ought to refrain from upholding the Constitution in all impeachment cases. Nor does it follow that, in cases of presidential impeachment, the Justices ought to abandon their constitutional responsibility because the Senate has precipitated a crisis.""

Dershowitz also knocked people for criticizing Trump's willingness to go to raise the prospect of a Supreme Court challenge.

CHAD PERGRAM: DEMOCRATS 'NOWHERE NEAR' THE AMOUNT OF VOTES THEY NEED FOR IMPEACHMENT

""No one should criticize President Trump for raising the possibility of Supreme Court review, especially following Bush v. Gore, the case that ended the 2000 election,"" he said. ""Many of the same academics ridiculed the notion that the justices would enter the political thicket of vote-counting.""

Dershowitz's op-ed came as media outlets amplified questions surrounding potential impeachment. While some in Congress supported that move, many didn't.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. -- who presides over the chamber responsible for impeachment -- has repeatedly pushed back on impeachment and, on Thursday, argued it could ultimately prevent an effective prosecution against the president.

Many have speculated that impeachment could spell trouble for Democrats in 2020, but some progressives, like Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., have argued that certain issues transcended politics.

Meanwhile, congressional Democrats continued pressing the administration for more information surrounding the Russia investigation -- coming up against the Trump administration's refusal to comply with congressional subpoenas."
The Paparazzi Staked Outside Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner’s D.C. Home,https://www.nytimes.com,['Shawn Mccreesh'],06-01-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/01/style/ivanka-trump-jared-kushner-paparazzi-daily-mail.html,"American Royalty?

Although paparazzi flare-ups aren’t unheard-of in Washington (just ask Dick Morris, Monica Lewinsky and Hope Hicks), this sustained stakeout is very TMZ for the land of C-Span.

So why, two years in, is The Daily Mail still so invested in Ms. Trump, even as some polls find that her approval numbers have sunk, particularly among the millennial American women who make up a key demographic for the Daily Mail website?

Maybe the tabloid, which is besotted with Meghan Markle, thinks it has locked onto the closest thing Americans have to a princess. Centuries after the break from the Crown, is The Daily Mail tapping into a strand of Yankee D.N.A. that yearns for erstwhile royalty?

Whatever the reason, Ms. Trump seems to be getting good ratings — to put it in Trumpian terms.

The Daily Mail did not return requests for comment, but former staffers said it was part of a strategy to boost web traffic. The Daily Mail was founded in 1896 and its print paper remains focused on British readers. Its website (officially known as the Mail Online), however, was started in 2003 and, according to comScore, within a decade became one of the most highly trafficked news sites worldwide , thanks in part to a cascade of celebrity click bait and lurid crime stories .

Former staffers attested to Ms. Trump as a traffic driver, with clicks coming primarily from the United States. “It’s a classic Daily Mail guilty pleasure,” said Taylor Lorenz, the former head of social media for The Daily Mail, about the nonstop coverage of Ms. Trump’s comings and goings. “If those posts weren’t doing well, they wouldn’t be running them.”

Mr. D’Agostino had another theory. “The Daily Mail has carved out a niche,” he said, speculating that the real value of his photos was to feed the maw of search engines and the 24-hour news cycle, “so that if you’re looking for a story about Jared and Ivanka, you’re going to end up on The Daily Mail.”"
Trump’s Middle East Peace Plan Faces a Crossroads After Coalition Talks in Israel Crumble,https://www.nytimes.com,['Mark Landler'],06-01-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/01/us/politics/trump-middle-east-peace-israel.html,"WASHINGTON — President Trump plans to throw his full weight behind Benjamin Netanyahu’s campaign to save his job as prime minister of Israel. But to do that, analysts and former diplomats said, the president will have to sacrifice any last hopes of proposing a peace plan that is acceptable to both Israelis and Palestinians.

Mr. Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, met Mr. Netanyahu in Jerusalem to discuss the status of the plan on Thursday, hours after the prime minister failed to form a governing coalition. Mr. Kushner emerged with a longer timetable and a narrower diplomatic mission, these people said.

Rather than make concessions to the Palestinians, Mr. Kushner will be under pressure to tilt the plan ever further in Israel’s favor. Far from being a bold effort to break decades of enmity between the two sides, it could end up becoming a vehicle to resurrect Mr. Netanyahu’s political fortunes and to protect Mr. Trump’s.

The plan, which Mr. Kushner has drafted under a veil of secrecy for more than two years, was already looking like a doomed effort. Though its details remain unknown, Mr. Kushner has suggested it will not call for the creation of a Palestinian state, jettisoning decades of American policy toward the conflict. The Palestinians have vowed to reject it out of hand, branding it a blueprint for Israeli domination."
President Trump says he was shocked by Meghan Markle's 'nasty' comment about him,https://www.foxnews.com,[],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/president-trump-shocked-meghan-markle-nasty-comments-uk-visit,"President Donald Trump has revealed his shock at Meghan Markle’s “nasty” comments about him — but believes she will make a great American princess.

The US leader can expect a lavish welcome from the Queen, Charles and Harry at Buckingham Palace on Monday.

Speaking to The Sun in the Oval Office, Trump told of his great honor at meeting the 93-year-old monarch again, and how he’s ready to lock horns with the Prince of Wales on climate change.

Relations with Meghan are believed to be much frostier — yet Trump was generous in his praise for the new mom.

Officially she will miss next week’s functions while on maternity with three-week-old son Archie. But it is thought she and Trump are being kept apart to avoid an embarrassing confrontation.

LA-born Meghan, 37, accused him of being “misogynistic” and “divisive” during his 2016 presidential campaign. The ex-""Suits"" actress also pledged to vote for his rival Hillary Clinton.

Told of Meghan’s barbs by The Sun, Trump insisted it was the first time he’d heard them. He said: “I didn’t know that. What can I say? I didn’t know that she was nasty.”

When told Meghan had threatened to leave for Canada if he won in 2016, he countered: “A lot of people are moving here (to the US).”

He also revealed that he had no idea that he wouldn’t be meeting Meghan on his three-day state visit to the UK. He said: “I didn’t know that. I hope she is OK.”

Rather than hit back at Meghan in his customary fashion, the President seemed willing to mend fences — while saying she can flourish in her new role. He predicted she will make “a very good” American princess.

On her joining the Royal Family, he added: “It is nice, and I am sure she will do excellently. She will be very good. I hope she does (succeed).”

Meghan detailed why she didn’t like Trump in a 2016 interview on US talk show, ""The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore."" She said: “It’s really the moment I go. We film 'Suits' in Toronto and I might just stay in Canada.

“Yes, of course, Trump is divisive, think about female voters alone, right?"" she said. “I think it was in 2012 the Republican Party lost the female vote by 12 points.""

“That is a huge number and with as misogynistic as Trump is, and so vocal about it, that is a huge chunk of it.”

She added: “You’re not just voting for a woman if it’s Hillary (Clinton). Yes, you’re voting because she’s a woman, but certainly, because Trump has made it easy to see that you don’t really want that kind of world that he’s painting.”

Trump, who will be joined on his trip by First Lady Melania, 49, is also ready to talk environmental issues with Charles over tea next week.

The Prince is expected to tackle the President on his controversial decision to pull America out of the Paris climate change agreement last year.

Trump told The Sun of the encounter: “I have met Charles before. I like Charles. I think that’s very good. We will be talking. I can say we have among the cleanest climate in the world right now.""

“Our air and water are doing very well. We hope other countries can do so well. You know, it is a big atmosphere and frankly if one country is going to be bad and other countries going to be good, the country that is good gets penalized. Which is unfair.”

In a sign at how deeply Trump values the honor of his state visit and being hosted by the Queen, he is bringing all four of his grown-up children and their spouses to share the experience.

And he wants Ivanka, Tiffany, Eric, and Donald Jr to hold a “next generation” meeting with Princes William and Harry. The President said: “I think my children will be meeting them. It would be nice.”

He explained: “I am bringing some of the family. They are going to be there and we will be greatly honored by the trip. It will be great seeing the Queen for the second time.""

“We had a very good talk the first one. We had a lot of interesting things to say. It really was a great visit. My mother also loved the Queen.”

The White House will cut off the special treatment of India, which is currently exempt from billions in tariffs, on June 5, The New York Times reported.

The notice of the change asserted that India did not allow the U.S. ""equitable and reasonable access to its markets.""

The administration will also tax Indian solar panels and washers, according to the Times, halting an exemption India and other countries obtained.

A Saturday statement from India's Ministry of Commerce and Industry called the development ""unfortunate,"" saying that the country tried to offer the U.S. ways to move forward.

""India as part of our bilateral trade discussions, had offered resolution on significant US requests in an effort to find a mutually acceptable way forward,"" it said. ""It is unfortunate that this did not find acceptance by the US.""

'Bare minimum': Britain decides no palace stay or parliamentary speech for Trump in low-key state visit,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],06-01-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/bare-minimum-britain-decides-no-palace-stay-or-parliamentary-speech-for-trump-in-low-key-state-visit,"Opening his speech to British parliamentarians in 2011, President Barack Obama said, “I have known few greater honors than the opportunity to address the Mother of Parliaments at Westminster Hall.""

It is an honor that will not be extended to President Trump next week during his first state visit to Britain, one of a number of differences from the trips made by his predecessors.

British and American officials have played down concerns about protests and insist that Trump is being afforded every bit of the usual hospitality — from dinner with the queen to bilateral talks with Theresa May, the prime minister.

But royal watchers said the Trumps will be missing out on many of the trappings of a state visit, such as staying at Buckingham Palace. “Not being invited to speak before Parliament is testament to the fact they know he is going to be rude and there’s going to be massive protests,"" said Marlene Koenig, an author and expert on British and European royalty.

“They are doing the bare minimum of what they would do for a state visit of a major ally.""

Rather than stayinhg with the Queen, Trump will be put up at Winfield House, residence of Woody Johnson, the United States ambassador to the Court of St James's. Johnson, the owner of the New York Jets, was appointed by Trump. Winfield House, a neo-Georgian manion in Regent's Park, has the advantage of being set in 12 acres of grounds, safely away from demonstrators.

Several honors afforded visiting American presidents or other heads of state will be missing.

He will not get the usual welcome in Horse Guards Parade, the grand parade ground in central London where visiting heads of state are usually invited to inspect the honor guard with the queen before a carriage procession to Buckingham Palace.

Instead, he will follow the example of President George W. Bush, who was given his royal welcome in the garden of Buckingham Palace in 2003 because of fears protesters would line the route through London. There, Trump will inspect the guard of honor, comprising the Nijmegen Company Grenadier Guards, with Prince Charles.

The reception stands in contrast to the visit of President John F. Kennedy in 1961. Then, some half a million cheering people gathered simply to catch a glimpse of him and his wife Jackie.

Trump will not get to stay at Buckingham Palace with the Queen. Both Bush and Obama, the only two American presidents to have been granted official state visits, stayed at the royal residence, but Trump has been told that renovations to the east wing of the palace meant its guest rooms were out of service.

American officials were eager to play down any hint of a snub and said the timing of the visit — to coincide with the 75th anniversary of D-Day — illustrated the strong bonds between the two countries. “It gives evidence to the fact that the special relationship between the U.S. and the U.K. is real and enduring,” said a senior administration official. “As the president himself has said, ‘It's a bond like no other.’”

The run-up to this visit featured speculation about whether Trump would be invited to address the British Parliament.

In the end, the speaker — the figure who presides over the House of Commons and who had previously said Trump’s attendance would run counter to Parliament’s longstanding opposition to sexism and racism — said he had not been asked by British officials to host the president. Presidents Obama, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, and Bill Clinton all addressed Parliament.

A U.K. official said Trump had not requested to address Parliament. ""The president not asking to do that is the norm,"" he said. On both sides of the Atlantic, a mutually-convenient cover story of Trump not being asked to be invited in order to avoid being told he will not be invited appears to have been adopted.

But protesters say they can already claim a victory in ensuring Trump will not address MPs and Lords.

“Our voices are being heard,” said Mohammed Ateek, a Syrian refugee and a spokesman for the Stop Trump Coalition. “What a shame if they had allowed him to address Parliament, which stands up for democracy.

“We contributed to this because if there were no voices being raised against Trump, then they would have said, why not?”

Previous visits have sometimes reflected the warm relations between individual leaders.

In 1982 the queen invited Ronald Reagan to stay with her at Windsor Castle and took him horse riding. A decade late, Bill and Hillary Clinton were treated to a night aboard the royal yacht Britannia.

And in 2011, Obama grilled sausages with David Cameron in the garden of Number 10 during an event for British and American service personnel."
DOJ reportedly exploring antitrust probe of Google,https://www.foxbusiness.com,['Megan Henney'],,,,https://www.foxbusiness.com/technology/doj-reportedly-exploring-antitrust-probe-of-google,"The U.S. Department of Justice is gearing up to investigate antitrust violations by Alphabet Inc.’s subsidiary Google, focusing largely on the company’s search practices, according to a Friday report from The Wall Street Journal.

The report comes amid renewed public scrutiny on the influence that big tech wields, as well as calls by 2020 presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren to break up some of the country’s biggest technology companies, including Amazon, Google and Facebook, which she referred to as “monopolies.”

If the DOJ proceeds with the investigation, it will mark the first major antitrust case against a big tech company since President Trump took office.

It’s unclear whether the DOJ has contacted Google. A spokesperson for the DOJ declined to comment. The FTC and Google did not immediately respond to FOX Business’ request for comment.

Google has faced questions about potential antitrust violations in the past.

The Federal Trade Commission, which shares antitrust authority with the DOJ, previously conducted a broad investigation of Google, looking into its advertising practices and influence in the online ad industry, but closed it in 2013 when the company agreed to voluntarily change some of its business practices, including agreeing to give online advertisers more flexibility to manage ad campaigns on Google, as well as its rival ad platforms.

In March, European Union regulators fined Google $1.7 billion for abusing its market dominance by preventing its rivals from placing online search advertisers,; in total, the EU has fined Google about $10 billion.

In a statement, the EU’s top antitrust watchdog, Margrethe Vestager, said Google cemented itself as a powerhouse in the online search industry -- then proceeded to shield itself from competition by imposing restrictive contracts with third-party websites that blocked other companies from placing their search adverts on those websites between 2006 and 2016.

“This is illegal under EU antitrust rules,” she said at the time.

The commission found that Google and its parent company Alphabet Inc. blocked competition by inserting exclusivity clauses into its contracts with third-party websites beginning in 2006, prohibiting publishers from placing any search adverts from competitors on their search results pages.

As of 2009, Google began to replace those clauses with a so-called premium placement clause, requiring websites to save the most visible and clicked on parts of the websites’ search results pages for Google"
"William Barr vs. Robert Mueller, explained",https://www.vox.com,['Jun'],06-01-2019,2019,6,https://www.vox.com/2019/6/1/18647362/mueller-barr-trump-obstruction-law,"Major disagreements between Robert Mueller and Attorney General William Barr have spilled out into public this week, with the dispute focusing on the handling of the investigation of President Trump for potential obstruction of justice.

On Wednesday, Mueller announced his resignation and made his first-ever public statement on the investigation, giving a summary of his conclusions that was conspicuously different from Barr’s. After that, Barr responded, defending his own decisions in an hour-long interview with CBS This Morning.

Discrepancies between Barr and Mueller have simmered for some time. Barr’s initial letter describing Mueller’s findings gave a starkly incomplete picture that seemed much rosier for Trump than the full report. And he has since adopted Trump’s line that the investigation found “there was in fact no collusion.” (Mueller says there was “insufficient evidence to charge a broader conspiracy.”)

But the heart of the current dispute relates to the highly unusual way the obstruction investigation wrapped up — with Mueller deciding not to reach a conclusion on whether Trump broke the law, and with Barr then deciding to reach the conclusion that he didn’t.

Barr is now taking aim at several of Mueller’s choices. He says Mueller “could’ve reached a decision” on whether Trump committed crimes. He says he disagrees with Mueller’s application of obstruction statutes to certain of Trump’s acts. And he says that even if you accept Mueller’s interpretation of obstruction law, the evidence against Trump was “deficient” in every single episode.

What Mueller did

Tasked with investigating President Trump for potentially attempting to obstruct the Russia investigation, Mueller conducted a thorough investigation into 11 particular “episodes” involving the president (including the firing of James Comey as FBI director, Trump’s conduct toward witnesses like Paul Manafort and Michael Cohen, and Trump’s attempts to dismiss Mueller himself).

But Mueller also determined that he could not indict a sitting president because of existing Justice Department policy. “Charging the President with a crime was therefore not an option we could consider,” he said this week.

Still: even if Mueller couldn’t charge Trump, it seemed at least possible that he would wrap up his investigation with a judgment on whether the president broke the law.

So it came as a surprise to many when he chose not to do that. “We concluded that we would not reach a determination, one way or the other, about whether the president committed a crime,” Mueller said Wednesday. In part, his report explains, this is because it would be unfair to accuse the president of a crime when he can’t be charged and have the opportunity to clear his name at trial.

What Mueller did instead was lay out evidence and analysis about each of the potentially obstructive episodes involving Trump. Specifically, he examined whether Trump’s actions in each case met three elements common to obstruction statutes: 1) whether they were obstructive acts, 2) whether they had a nexus to an official proceeding, and 3) whether there was corrupt intent.

Often, Mueller’s analysis seemed quite damning. For some of the episodes, he said there was “substantial” evidence that all three of those elements applied; for others, his assessment was more mixed. But he never took the final step of clearly saying Trump broke the law or committed a crime in any instance.

Yet in one last twist, Mueller also said that if he had “confidence” that Trump “clearly did not commit obstruction of justice,” he would say so — and that he is “unable to reach that judgment.” So he implied that, at the very least, Trump’s conduct wasn’t obviously innocent.

What Barr did

As Mueller was wrapping up his work in March, he informed the Justice Department and its new attorney general, Barr, that he wouldn’t reach a judgment on whether Trump obstructed justice.

Barr has testified that he was “frankly surprised” to hear this, and he told CBS this week that he didn’t agree with that call. “He could’ve reached a conclusion. The opinion says you cannot indict a president while he is in office but he could’ve reached a decision as to whether it was criminal activity,” Barr said.

Then Mueller may have been surprised at what Barr did next — he decided to step into the void and issue his own conclusion on Trump’s conduct.

Barr says he worked with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and other Justice Department lawyers on this, and that there were two parts to their analysis.

First, he says, he offered up a different interpretation of how the obstruction statutes could be applied to Trump’s actions.

“We didn’t agree with the legal analysis — a lot of the legal analysis in the report. It did not reflect the views of the department. It was the views of a particular lawyer or lawyers and so we applied what we thought was the right law,” he told CBS.

Barr said that, for instance, the president’s firing of an FBI director is a “facially valid exercise of core presidential authority,” so the obstruction of justice statutes shouldn’t apply to it. (He made a similar argument last year in a memo before he got the attorney general job.)

Second, though, he says, he didn’t just “rely on” his team’s alternate interpretation of how the obstruction statutes should be applied — he also examined whether, under Mueller’s interpretation of the obstruction laws, Trump’s actions in any instance satisfied all three elements of the statute (that they were obstructive acts, that they had a nexus to an official proceeding, and that they were done with corrupt intent).

For every single one, Barr said, “we thought long and hard about it, we looked at the facts and we didn’t feel the government could establish obstruction.”

It’s certainly a convenient conclusion for Trump. And it’s curious that we actually haven’t seen any of Barr’s analysis on these topics, beyond his brief letter to Congress.

What are Barr’s responses to the seemingly damning analysis Mueller gave about certain episodes? Did he in fact think “long and hard” about it and seriously study Mueller’s evidence and arguments? Or was it more of a hasty “nothing to see here” whitewash?

How can a president be held accountable for lawbreaking?

Looming over all this are the tremendously important issues of what is to be done when the president of the United States may have committed criminal wrongdoing — and whether the president is in fact above the law.

Currently, there’s no easy answer to this within the US government. The Justice Department, which is charged with investigating and enforcing federal law, is to at least some extent subordinate to the president and run by his appointees. And DOJ has taken the position that it cannot indict a sitting president.

Congress, meanwhile, has the constitutional authority to impeach and remove a president. But it doesn’t really have the ability or expertise to conduct a serious criminal investigation.

Now, Mueller’s role as a Justice Department special counsel required him to submit “a confidential report explaining the prosecution or declination decisions reached” to the attorney general (not to Congress).

Still, some have speculated that Mueller may have truly intended his report for Congress to act on. Under this interpretation, Mueller gathered facts and did the analysis, but one reason for his refusal to take the final step and say that Trump’s conduct was criminal was because he believed that was Congress’s job.

Mueller has never outright said he intended any such thing. But in his remarks Wednesday, the special counsel did mention how “the Constitution requires a process other than the criminal justice system to formally accuse a sitting President of wrongdoing.”

Barr, however, recoiled at this very concept “The Department of Justice doesn’t use our powers of investigating crimes as an adjunct to Congress,” he told CBS. “Congress is a separate branch of government and they can, you know, they have processes, we have our processes. Ours are related to the criminal justice process. We are not an extension of Congress’s investigative powers.”

And these arguments aren’t baseless. Mueller had no actual obligation or authority under the law to give his final report to Congress, and certainly not to make an impeachment referral. Barr’s critique is that Mueller was a Justice Department special counsel investigating violations of federal criminal law. And the impeachment process has nothing to do with federal criminal law. So why should the special counsel be involved in it?

In any case, Barr did choose to release the report anyway, and Congress now has the ability to decide how it wants to proceed. But the question remains: What should the Justice Department do when it thinks the president may have violated federal criminal law? This whole messy process hasn’t resulted in any clear answer."
Migrants at overcrowded border facilities may become violent: DHS watchdog,https://nypost.com,['June'],06-01-2019,2019,6,https://nypost.com/2019/06/01/migrants-at-overcrowded-border-facilities-may-become-violent-dhs-watchdog/,"Migrants seeking asylum and being held at an overcrowded US Border Patrol facility in Texas could become violent due to the inhumane conditions, an internal Department of Homeland Security watchdog found.

Justice Department does not comply with court order to release transcripts of Michael Flynn’s conversations with Russian ambassador,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Carol D.

(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)

Federal prosecutors on Friday declined to make public transcripts of recorded conversations between Michael Flynn and Russia’s ambassador to the United States in December 2016, despite a judge’s order.

In a court filing Friday, the Justice Department wrote that it did not rely on such recordings to establish Flynn’s guilt or determine a recommendation for his sentencing.

Prosecutors also failed to release an unredacted version of portions of the Mueller report related to Flynn that the judge had ordered be made public.

Flynn, who served briefly as President Trump’s first national security adviser, pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his conversation with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, and he cooperated with special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s investigation. He is awaiting sentencing.

The government’s unusual response came after U.S. District Judge Emmet G. Sullivan in Washington ordered earlier in May that the Justice Department make public various materials related to the case, including transcripts of any audio recordings of Flynn, such as his conversations with Russian officials.

[Judge orders public release of what Michael Flynn said in call to Russian ambassador]

Prosecutors provided one item that Sullivan ordered be released: a transcript of a voice mail left by an attorney for Trump, much of which had already appeared in Mueller’s report. It is unclear how the judge will react to the government’s noncompliance with other elements of his order. Late last year, Sullivan postponed Flynn’s sentencing after angrily lambasting the former national security adviser for his actions, saying, “Arguably, you sold your country out.”

While Flynn’s interactions with Kislyak were described in Mueller’s report and in court documents, the exact words the two men used have not been revealed. U.S. officials have not publicly confirmed the existence of recordings, which are classified.

Sullivan made clear he wanted the full transcript of Flynn’s calls to be shared with the public, although he did not provide his reasoning. The Justice Department’s response appeared to duck that order.

Prosecutors Brandon L. Van Grack of the Justice Department’s national security division, who was formerly on Mueller’s team, and Assistant U.S. Attorney Deborah Curtis of Washington provided little explanation as to why they were not turning over the transcripts but indicated that the judge had asked for material that was not relevant to Flynn’s eventual sentencing.

In a single line addressing Sullivan’s order, prosecutors wrote that the government “is not relying on any other recordings, of any person, for purposes of establishing the defendant’s guilt or determining his sentence, nor are there any other recordings that are part of the sentencing record.”

Sullivan’s request was atypical, some legal experts said, in that he demanded the release of classified records that prosecutors did not use to prove Flynn’s guilt.

Still, some former prosecutors said the government’s response was also notably spare.

“I’m sure they spent a ton of time thinking about how to do this — to protect intelligence equities, to protect their case, to try not to annoy the judge, to balance all those interests,” said Barbara McQuade, a former U.S. attorney in Michigan.

She noted that although there was no public indication that prosecutors had filed additional material under seal, it was possible that they did.

“If they’re simply trying to avoid the order by sidestepping it and saying ‘it’s not necessary to your sentencing decision,’ judges tend not to be satisfied with such a response,” she added.

The U.S. attorney’s office in Washington declined to comment.

The transcripts of the Flynn-Kisylak calls would provide a rare glimpse into the power of American surveillance to capture the private discussions of foreign emissaries — and an intimate look at a budding relationship between a top Russian official and one of the president-elect’s most trusted lieutenants in the weeks before Trump took office.

Flynn’s lying about his contacts with the Russian ambassador made him the shortest-serving national security adviser in U.S. history: He spent just 24 days in the prestigious White House job.

Sullivan ordered the transcripts of Flynn’s conversations released two weeks ago after The Washington Post filed a motion seeking the release of redacted and sealed documents in the case. The Post argued that the public deserved to know more about the Trump adviser’s role in key events and the information he shared with investigators.

As part of his order, Sullivan had also given the government until Friday to release an unredacted version of portions of Mueller’s report dealing with Flynn.

In declining to release that, prosecutors wrote that the “limited remaining redactions pertain to sourcing of information, such as references to grand jury subpoenas.”

They provided no explanation other than to say that “all of the information in the Report that the defendant provided to the Special Counsel’s Office has been unredacted, as has all of the information in the Report that others provided about the defendant.”

The one item that the Justice Department made public on Sullivan’s order was a full transcript of a voice mail that John Dowd, a private attorney for Trump, left for Flynn lawyer Robert Kelner in November 2017.

Most of the voice mail was quoted in Mueller’s report, which described a message left by a personal counsel to Trump for a Flynn attorney after the former national security adviser began to cooperate with investigators. The special counsel scrutinized the message as part of his investigation into whether Trump sought to obstruct the Russia investigation.

The Trump counsel was Dowd, according to people familiar with the episode.

In the voice mail to Kelner, Dowd described himself as “sympathetic.”

“I understand your situation, but let me see if I can’t state it in starker terms,” he said, adding that if “there’s information that implicates the President, then we’ve got a national security issue.”

“So you know, ...we need some kind of heads up,” he added. “Um, just for the sake of protecting all our interests if we can, without you having to give up any...confidential information....remember what we’ve always said about the President and his feelings toward Flynn and, that still remains.”

In a statement Friday, Dowd said there was never anything improper about his contact with Flynn’s lawyer and that he had never tried to discourage Flynn’s cooperation with the government.

“This is clearly a baseless, political document designed to smear and damage the reputation of counsel and innocent people,” Dowd said of the special counsel report.

State Dept. panel to redefine human rights based on 'natural law and natural rights',https://abcnews.go.com,['Abc News'],,,,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/state-dept-panel-redefine-human-rights-based-natural/story?id=63400485,"Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is setting up a commission at the State Department to redefine human rights as based on what the department is describing as ""natural law and natural rights.""

The move has alarmed human rights activists, especially those focused on LGBT rights and women's rights, who fear it will mean an end to promoting protections for both groups around the world.

""It's an important review of how we think about human rights inside of our efforts in diplomacy,"" Pompeo told reporters Thursday, adding the effort is focused on ""how do we make sure that we have a solid definition of human rights upon which to tell all our diplomats around the world how to engage on those important issues.""

The State Department has declined to comment beyond Pompeo's remarks. But it did issue a public notice in the Federal Register on Thursday that says the body, named the Commission on Unalienable Rights, will provide Pompeo ""advice and recommendations concerning international human rights matters"" and meet about once a month.

""The Commission will provide fresh thinking about human rights discourse where such discourse has departed from our nation's founding principles of natural law and natural rights,"" according to the notice.

Use of the term ""natural law"" has concerned some advocacy groups and department staff, as it is interpreted in this case as ""God-given"" or religiously-based rights that affect issues like sexuality, abortion rights, and more. In particular, the phrase has been prominent in the work of Princeton professor Robert George.

George has played a prominent role in the creation of the commission, according to a source familiar with the plans for the commission. George, co-founder of the National Organization for Marriage, a nonprofit that advocates against same-sex marriage, is among the 15 academics recommended to make up the panel, according to the source.

Author of the 1999 book ""In Defense of Natural Law,"" where he argued against homosexuality and abortion rights and in favor of religious liberty, George also wrote the original concept note that outlined a vision for the commission, the source said.

The commission ""is absolutely about those issues, but it's not explicit in the paper,"" the source said. ""It questions whether and which human rights are universal.""

George did not respond to a request for comment.

Dr. Kiron Skinner, Pompeo's director of policy planning, is listed as the top official on the Federal Register notice. Skinner, who leads the department's long-term foreign policy strategy team, recently raised eyebrows by describing the U.S. rivalry with China as a clash of civilizations and ""the first time that we will have a great power competitor that is not Caucasian.""

Along with George and Skinner, the full list of participants has been recommended to the Secretary, but he still has to approve the final list. As part of the process, however, the department had to publish the Federal Register notice, which is dated May 22.

Igniting further concern about the project is the fact that the department's Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor was not consulted in the process, two sources told ABC News.

""The wording of the Commission's mandate raised eyebrows with human rights advocates and congressional staff. The fact that it was announced with no prior outreach to or input from the human rights community immediately raised concerns over its motives... [and] the State Department already has a well-defined understanding of how to advance human rights and maintains several offices dedicated to various human rights issues,"" said Rob Berschinski, who served as deputy assistant secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, or DRL, in the Obama administration.

Pompeo said Thursday the project is ""separate"" from DRL, but ""deeply connected to the work that not only DRL does, but that the entire State Department does around the world.""

Promoting the right to religious freedom has been a high priority for Pompeo, who will host his second summit on the topic this July. But he and the Trump administration, in general, have been criticized for pulling punches on U.S. partners over their human rights abuses. Saudi Arabia and Egypt, for example, have been embraced by the top Trump officials despite their crackdowns on political opposition, women's rights activists, and NGOs.

""If the administration truly wants to engage in a meaningful dialogue about respecting human rights, then we are happy to have that discussion. But the fact that this panel was announced without details or consultation with human rights experts suggests that this may be just another instrument to negate rights, rather than protect them,"" said Tarah Demant, director of Amnesty International's Gender, Sexuality, and Identity program."
US Border Patrol agents will deploy to Guatemala to train 'side-by-side',https://www.cnn.com,['Geneva Sands'],05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/31/politics/us-border-patrol-agents-will-train-guatemala/index.html,"(CNN) US Border Patrol agents and other Department of Homeland Security law enforcement officers will be sent to Guatemala to assist in training missions with local authorities as part of a two-year plan aimed at decreasing migration flows to the United States.

Agents will be ""side-by-side"" with local Guatemalan authorities, deployed to locations where US law enforcement has not traditionally operated, according to a senior DHS official.

This is a unique surge of DHS personnel to Guatemala, with a ""significant increase"" in US law enforcement presence in the country, said acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan.

The deployment of DHS officers follows an agreement signed earlier this week between the US and Guatemalan governments. It comes as the administration is trying to find a way to stem the influx of migrant families, mostly from Central America, through Mexico to the US.

The number of migrants illegally crossing the the southern US border has been on a steady upswing, resulting in dangerous overcrowding in US holding facilities at the border. The month of May is on pace to have the highest number of border crossings in over 12 years, according to McAleenan.

The inspector general report said that the El Paso Del Norte Processing Center in Texas, which has a maximum capacity of 125 people, was holding as many as 900.

""[Customs and Border Protection] was struggling to maintain hygienic conditions in the holding cells. With limited access to showers and clean clothing, detainees were wearing soiled clothing for days or weeks,"" the report said. ""We also observed detainees standing on toilets in the cells to make room and gain breathing space, thus limiting access to the toilets.""

It determined that the agency should “take immediate steps to alleviate the overcrowding at the El Paso Del Norte Processing Center.” The agency concurred with the report's finding."
Border Patrol holding 900 at facility fit for 125 in situation that ‘could turn violent’,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,"['U.S. Department Of Homeland Security', 'Office Of Inspector General']",06-01-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/border-patrol-holding-900-at-facility-fit-for-125-in-situation-that-could-turn-violent,"A government watchdog is warning of a potentially “violent” situation at one Border Patrol station on the U.S.-Mexico border where migrants are held in unsafe conditions. Even so, Homeland Security officials are not planning changes anytime soon.

The Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General released a report Friday that found “dangerous overcrowding” among adults being held at the El Paso Del Norte Processing Center in West Texas.

During an unannounced trip to the border May 7 to 8, Inspector General Office workers observed 900 people being held at a facility where the maximum capacity is 125 people.

Inspectors peered into cells and found 76 people in one fit for a dozen people. Another cell suitable for eight people held 41. A third cell with capacity for 35 was holding 155 people.

“Border Patrol agents told us some of the detainees had been held in standing-room-only conditions for days or weeks,” the inspector general report states.

CBP’s 2015 National Standards on Transport, Escort, Detention, and Search standards state that “under no circumstances should the maximum occupancy rate, as set by the fire marshal, be exceeded.”

The report revealed that not only were people being held in overcrowded conditions, they were also being held far longer than Border Patrol policy states detainees can be held before being transferred to Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

“According to Border Patrol’s custody logs, there were 756 detainees on site when we visited PDT on May 7, 2019. Of those, 502 detainees (66 percent) had been held at PDT for longer than 72 hours [the limit outlined in TEDS], with 33 detainees (4 percent) held there for more than two weeks,” the report states.

CBP said hygiene conditions have sunk because detainees do not have adequate access to showers and clean clothing. Some men and women had been in “soiled clothing for days or weeks.” Because of the overcrowded cells, some were standing on toilets, making it difficult or impossible to use those facilities.

“We are concerned that overcrowding and prolonged detention represent an immediate risk to the health and safety not just of the detainees, but also DHS agents and officers. Border Patrol management on site said there is a high incidence of illness among their staff,” the report states. “In addition, Border Patrol management on site said there is an ongoing concern that rising tensions among detainees could turn violent.”

An unspecified number of Border Patrol agents have opted to retire early while others were looking at leaving their jobs.

Agents at the station told the inspectors they called ICE on a daily basis hoping new beds would be available so that some detainees could be transferred out of the agency’s custody.

U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Office of Inspector General

The El Paso Border Patrol sector is one of nine on the southern border. Since the start of fiscal 2019 in October, the region has seen the second-highest number of families illegally crossing: 98,052. That figure is up 1,816% from the same time the previous year.

The inspector general’s office said it informed acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan about its concerns and was unsatisfied with his department’s response. DHS said it is building a tent near the facility that will be able to hold 500 people by July 31.

“We observed conditions at the El Paso Del Norte Processing Center (PDT) Border Patrol facility that represent an immediate risk to the health and safety of detainees and DHS employees … Dangerous overcrowding among single adults in PDT requires immediate action,” inspectors wrote."
Spray cheese would count as food stamp staple under Trump administration proposal,https://www.cbsnews.com,"[""Caitlin O'Kane""]",,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-administration-proposal-would-count-spray-cheese-beef-jerky-staple-foods/,"A new policy proposed by the Trump administration would allow foods like spray cheese to be considered ""staples"" for federal food stamps. Staple foods are important to the food stamps program, officially known as SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program), as regulations require SNAP retailers to stock a certain number of these food staples.

Loosening the rules would allow more retailers like convenience stores to accept SNAP benefits, even if they don't carry much in the way of fresh or healthy food.

A 2001 rule from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) required stores that take SNAP to carry a variety of foods in each of the four ""staple food"" categories: Meat, poultry, or fish; dairy products; bread or cereals; and vegetables or fruits. The stores must also carry at least one perishable item in at least two of the categories.

Under the new proposal, which was introduced in April, canned spray cheese or canned cheese dipping sauce would count as a dairy, pimento-stuffed olives would count as a vegetable or fruit, and beef jerky would count as a meat.

The Department of Agriculture said the new proposal ""provides greater regulatory flexibility to SNAP retailers, particularly small entities, in meeting the enhanced stocking requirements of the 2016 final rule.""

This Obama-era rule required SNAP stores carry a wider variety of foods in each group, increasing the number of products from three to seven in each staple group. Some food industry groups opposed this rule, believing small SNAP retailers ""would struggle to reach seven (7) varieties in the meat, poultry, or fish and dairy products staple food categories and such commenters suggested increasing flexibility for stores in these categories,"" the USDA writes.

The National Association of Convenience Stores, which lobbied for the proposed change, said ""meeting the new requirements can be difficult for convenience stores and other small format retailers who face constraints on supply and delivery.""

""On average, convenience stores get food deliveries 1-2 times a week, which can make stocking certain foods, particularly perishable foods, difficult,"" NACS writes on their website. The proposed changes would address this problem by giving retailers more flexibility, saving small businesses $500 over the course of five years, the Department of Agriculture said.

However, some consumer advocates blasted the proposal for putting retailers' interests ahead of the health and nutrition needs of poor families.

The Center for Science in the Public Interest is urging people to ""tell the U. S. Department of Agriculture that low-income families deserve to shop in stores that offer a meaningful variety of healthy staple foods.""

""You don't have to have a nutrition degree to know that canned spray cheese sauce is not a staple food,"" Margo Wootan, the group's vice president for nutrition, told Bloomberg News, which first reported on the proposal. She compared it to the notorious Reagan administration federal school lunch policy which sought to count ketchup as a vegetable.

""Those are not real food you could serve to your family for dinner,"" Wootan said.

The Department of Agriculture will be taking public comments on the proposal until June 7, when a decision to adopt the new rules will be made."
"Justice Dept. Keeps Wiretaps Secret in Flynn Case, Rejecting Judge’s Order",https://www.nytimes.com,['Adam Goldman'],05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/31/us/politics/flynn-kislyak-wiretap.html,"WASHINGTON — Federal prosecutors rebuffed a judge’s order to release by Friday highly classified transcripts of discussions that Michael T. Flynn, the president’s former national security adviser, had with the Russian ambassador during the presidential transition.

The transcripts between Mr. Flynn and Sergey I. Kislyak, formerly Russia’s top diplomat in the United States, were expected to show that they talked in December 2016 about sanctions that the Obama administration had just imposed on Russia. Mr. Flynn initially denied those exchanges about sanctions both to Trump administration officials and the F.B.I. in the weeks after the discussions.

The conversations prompted concerns among senior Obama administration officials about whether the Trump transition team was flouting norms about holding off on making policy until after taking office. The phone calls were also at the center of the scandal that eventually prompted Mr. Flynn’s ouster just weeks into President Trump’s term.

The order this month from the judge, Emmet G. Sullivan of the Federal District Court in the District of Columbia, was unusual. The transcripts came from a secret F.B.I. wiretap of Mr. Kislyak, and their release would have provided an extraordinarily rare look at the fruits of the government’s eavesdropping. Agents routinely listen to wiretaps of foreign officials, but they remain among the government’s most closely held secrets."
Elizabeth Warren says she wants to make it legal to indict presidents,https://www.vox.com,['May'],05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.vox.com/2019/5/31/18647042/elizabeth-warren-trump-indictment-mueller,"Special counsel Robert Mueller said indicting President Donald Trump was “not an option” this week, citing a longstanding Justice Department policy that shields a sitting president from criminal indictments and prosecution.

Now Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) says she would change the policy as president.

Warren, among the first major Democratic 2020 candidates to call for Trump’s impeachment, released a two-part proposal on presidential powers Friday. First, she called on Congress to pass a law clarifying that the president of the United States is subject to the same federal criminal code as everyone else. Second, she pledged to appoint an attorney general and assistant AG who would change current Justice Department policy around indicting sitting presidents.

“Donald Trump believes that he can violate the law, and he believes that the role of the Department of Justice is to help him get away with it. That’s not how our country is supposed to work,” Warren wrote. “I pledge to nominate an [Office of Legal Counsel] head who will reverse the Watergate-era rule that a President cannot be indicted for criminal behavior.”

On Wednesday, Mueller reiterated he was operating under DOJ policy, as presented by the Office of Legal Counsel, that a sitting president cannot be charged with a federal crime.

“Under longstanding department policy a president cannot be charged with a federal crime while he is in office,” Mueller said. “That is unconstitutional. ... The special counsel’s office is part of the Department of Justice and by regulation it was bound by that department policy. Charging the president with a crime was, therefore, not an option we could consider.”

To be clear, what Mueller is referring to is not something expressly written in the Constitution. It’s a large gray area in the nation’s body of law — which Warren says she would address as president.

The question of presidential immunity, briefly explained

The closest the Supreme Court has come to answering the question of presidential immunity recently is a 1997 ruling in Clinton v. Jones, which maintained that a president is subject to civil lawsuits. But whether a sitting president can be subject to criminal prosecution remains an unanswered question in the courts.

Upon review in 1973 and again in 2000, OLC concluded that the best way to address criminal charges is to wait until a president leaves office, leaving impeachment as the avenue for accountability.

As Vox’s Dylan Matthews explained, the most famous argument in favor of making presidents immune from criminal prosecution is from a 1997 law review article by Yale constitutional law professor Akhil Amar and a then-student of his, Brian Kalt, who’s now a law professor at Michigan State University:

Amar and Kalt argue that the president is a unique official, as the sole person ultimately in charge of the executive branch. “If he is arrested, so too is the executive branch of the government,” they write. This distinguishes him from a normal legislator or judge, who can be prosecuted, because there are plenty of other judges and legislators who can carry on their work. “Any distraction of the President from his duties is much more significant than similar distractions of these other, prosecutable officials, and has a much bigger impact on the well-being of the nation and all its People,” they conclude.

But even Kalt says this is unsettled territory. There is an argument to be made that the president should be subject to the same legal standard as everybody else, and that there are structures in place to address a president with “distractions” from his executive duties.

The investigation into Trump, and the special counsel report outlining evidence that Trump may have obstructed justice, has raised this issue into the forefront once again.

The EPA says a chemical in Monsanto's weed-killer doesn't cause cancer — but there's compelling evidence the agency is wrong,https://www.businessinsider.com,['Hilary Brueck'],06-01-2019,2019,6,https://www.businessinsider.com/glyphosate-cancer-dangers-roundup-epa-2019-5,"Gardeners Alva and Alberta Pilliod say they used Monsanto's Roundup spray to keep weeds off their driveway for more than two decades, applying the herbicide while wearing flip flops, shorts, and tank tops. Now, they both have Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL). In a lawsuit, they were awarded $2.05 billion in damages in May.

School groundskeeper Dewayne Johnson, now in his 40s, also used to spray Roundup up to 30 times every summer. He has the same blood cancer as the Pilliods, and won nearly $80 million in a suit last year.

A third man, Edwin Hardeman, used Roundup for more than 25 years to keep weeds off his oak trees. He got NHL, too. A jury in California ruled in March that Roundup was a ""substantial factor"" in his diagnosis.

More than 13,000 similar lawsuits have popped up in the US. Almost all are being filed by gardeners, groundskeepers, and other professional weed-whackers who allege that their consistent, repeated use of Roundup gave them cancer. One of the latest allegations came this week from 44-year-old groundskeeper Jeffrey Sabraski. Sabraski alleges he sprayed Roundup several times per week, wearing nothing but shorts and t-shirts, and has also developed NHL. He's suing Monsanto, as the Minneapolis Star Tribune reported on Wednesday.

Roundup is the most widely-used herbicide in the world, and its key chemical is called glyphosate. The plaintiffs in this recent surge of court cases say that Monsanto didn't sufficiently warn them about the potential health risks associated with the product or tell them how to protect themselves from exposure.

But teasing out the health risks of glyphosate isn't easy. The World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) says the chemical is ""probably"" carcinogenic to humans. But the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the agro-chemical giant Bayer, which now owns Monsanto, both say glyphosate isn't linked to cancer in any meaningful way.

""EPA continues to find that there are no risks to public health when glyphosate is used in accordance with its current label and that glyphosate is not a carcinogen,"" the agency said on its website. Canadian health authorities support the US' stance.

However, peeling back the curtain on the scientific studies that have looked at glyphosate thus far can tell us a lot about how the chemical can indeed be dangerous when people and animals are exposed to it in the wrong ways.

What Monsanto and the EPA say about glyphosate

Glyphosate, which has been in use around the world since the 1970s, blocks an enzyme pathway that helps plants grow. The herbicide's patent expired in 2000, and Indian and Chinese farmers are now the weed-killer's biggest buyers.

It's tricky for epidemiologists to say conclusively that something causes cancer, so what we know so far — from thousands of studies conducted in rats, mice, and humans — is that the pesticide might be linked with cancer, or it might not. Glyphosate might make cancer more likely to sprout up, since there's evidence it can encourage DNA damage. But more research is still needed to learn how, exactly, it affects the human body.

Monsanto maintains there's no good evidence the chemical causes cancer. The company often points to a 2017 study of more than 54,000 pesticide sprayers in Iowa and North Carolina (mostly farmers), which found no statistically significant association between glyphosate and cancer.

The company also often highlights the results of large-scale studies of French, Norwegian, and North American farmers that have found glyphosate to be safe.

But farmers are largely protected from the dangers of herbicides and pesticides, since they spray fields using industrial-grade farm equipment. In that same study, in fact, chemical sprayers who had the most exposure to glyphosate were found to have a slightly higher risk of developing acute myeloid leukemia than people who'd never used the weed-killer. The difference, however, was so small that more research is needed to confirm these results.

The EPA has also consistently said that consumers have nothing to worry about when it comes to glyphosate.

""In 2017, EPA published comprehensive ecological and human health risk assessments for glyphosate. No human health risks were identified,"" the agency said in April. However, the EPA cautioned that ""potential ecological risks were identified for terrestrial and aquatic plants, birds, and mammals, primarily from exposure to spray drift.""

Humans, of course, are terrestrial mammals, too. And gardeners who use lots of glyphosate — without much protection — would arguably also be exposed to spray drift.

""The evidence is not as strong so as to be absolutely sure"" Manolis Kogevinas, of the Barcelona Institute for Global Health, told Business Insider. ""But yeah, there's definitely a chance that they will develop cancer.""

The IARC has a different stance

In March 2015, the IARC convened a group of 17 experts from 11 countries to determine the potential human health dangers of glyphosate, along with four other pesticides and herbicides. The international, non-partisan committee concluded that glyphosate is ""probably"" carcinogenic to humans, based on studies in humans and lab animals.

That's why glyphosate is now a ""Group 2A"" carcinogen, according to IARC. That means that the chemical is considered to be a contributor to cancer, but not on the level of more well known cancer-causers like formaldehyde and UV radiation.

But the IARC also has a complicated history with glyphosate research. Reuters reported in 2017 that the agency had cut sections out of a draft report that suggested glyphosate might not contribute to cancer. In a follow-up letter to Congress, IARC director Christopher Wild wrote that the group revised that draft because some of the data came from ""a review article co-authored by a Monsanto scientist.""

He added that the information from that article ""was insufficient for independent evaluation of the individual studies and the conclusions reached by the Monsanto scientist.""

Why these groups came to different conclusions about glyphosate

A tightly reviewed and vetted paper published in the journal Environmental Sciences Europe earlier this year looked into why the EPA and IARC appear to disagree about the risks of glyphosate. It found that the EPA's conclusions relied mainly on ""unpublished regulatory studies,"" many of them industry-funded. The IARC, on the other hand, looked at ""mostly peer-reviewed studies.""

That could explain why 99% of the glyphosate studies that the EPA considered found that the chemical is not a cancer-causer, while 70% of the studies the WHO looked at suggested it probably is.

""It's kind of easy to understand why EPA would say, 'Well, geez, you know, it must be okay,'"" study author Charles Benbrook, an agricultural economist who now serves as an expert witness for plaintiffs involved in Roundup litigation, told Business Insider. ""It was okay because they were looking at a bunch of negative studies that Monsanto [did]. Monsanto repeated essentially the same study like 30 times.""

Benbrook alleges that the reason so many big payouts are being won in court is that Monsanto didn't properly warn people who used Roundup at home or on a small scale that they should wear protective clothing when they applied the weed-killer.

""It's not farmers out in the field with their large, modern spray rigs, where the operator is inside a steel and glass cab with a sophisticated air filtration system that essentially eliminates exposure,"" Benbrook said. ""Some people are spraying Roundup 6 or 8 hours a day for five days a week with this kind of handheld equipment.""

Monsanto maintains that as long as consumers follow the instructions on the label, glyphosate-based herbicides are perfectly safe. The company also points to hundreds of glyphosate studies in EPA databases that were not Monsanto-funded.

""At the end of the day, whether you're in the court of law, regulatory agencies, or court of public opinion, it's the science that should matter here,"" a Bayer spokesman said in an email to Business Insider. ""And the extensive body of science over 40 years, including several recent human epidemiology studies, shows that glyphosate-based herbicides are not associated with NHL. Customers who know these products best continue to rely on them.""

The company also points to the courtroom testimony of Robert Phalen, an environmental scientist who testified in the Pilliod's trial that human skin actually repels glyphosate. (Phalen once authored a textbook with another scientist also named Robert Phalen, who has said modern air may be ""a little too clean."")

Monsanto tweaked its Roundup formula in Europe

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends that pets stay off lawns and plants that have just been sprayed with glyphosate, since animals can develop digestive or intestinal issues if they touch the substance when it hasn't dried. Glyphosate has also recently been linked to more severe cases of fatty liver disease in people.

But beyond glyphosate, there's another compound in Roundup: soap-like detergents called surfactants that help the chemical penetrate the leaves of plants to work its weed-killing magic. Benbrook believes Monsanto should be doing more to warn people about how surfactants work and how to protect themselves.

""It's the surfactants that are carrying the glyphosate first through the skin and inside the body, and then inside of cells where damage can be done to DNA,"" he said.

In Europe, Benbrook noted, surfactant chemicals have been made less toxic for consumers. In the US, however, there's been less regulatory pressure, so Monsanto has not changed Roundup formulas in the same way. ""When juries learn that Monsanto is making a product that's at least 10 times, maybe 100 times safer all across Europe?"" he said. ""That's not acceptable. That's one of the reasons that I think we can expect a continuation of these mammoth punitive damage awards that have occurred in the first three trials.""

Bayer said that allegation is one ""we don't believe is supported by the extensive body of science.""

The company told Business Insider in an email that ""regulators have specifically assessed the safety of the class of surfactants used in glyphosate-based herbicides; in 2009, the U.S. EPA concluded that these surfactants are not carcinogenic.""

The statement added that Monsanto tweaked the surfactants in products sold in Europe ""due to market preferences or country-specific requirements in the region.""

Traces of glyphosate in food don't seem to hurt people

As lawsuits about glyphosate have entered the spotlight, some people have expressed concerns about the trace amounts of the chemical in our food.

The traces of glyphosate found in a bowl of Cheerios or a glass of wine are probably not going to kill anyone, though.

""Using the internationally accepted limits, an average adult male would have to drink over 1,000 liters of wine a day to reach any level of risk,"" pharmacologist Ian Musgrave recently wrote in The Conversation.

That said, it's worth remembering that different people's bodies can react differently to chemicals. The foods pregnant women eat impact how their fetus grows and develops, for example, and the developing digestive systems of infants and toddlers may be more delicate than others. Scientists are still studying how pesticides can impact childhood brain development.

Kogevinas still doesn't think the chemical's presence in food is much to worry about, though.

""If you ask me, is the glyphosate the problem in my food? No, it is not,"" he said. But he noted that he prefers to buy organic produce to avoid pesticides more generally.

Kogevinas lives in Barcelona, where the Roundup formulations adhere to the European standards, but that didn't affect his decision about whether or not to buy it: He has opted never to use glyphosate in his own garden."

CNN reports the IG said that during an unannounced inspection investigators found unsanitary and “standing-room only conditions” at the processing center. One cell built to hold 12 migrants had 76 detainees, while another meant for eight people had 41 migrants, the report says. “[Customs and Border Protection] was struggling to maintain hygienic conditions in the holding cells. With limited access to showers and clean clothing, detainees were wearing soiled clothing for days or weeks,” the report says. “We also observed detainees standing on toilets in the cells to make room and gain breathing space, thus limiting access to the toilets.” The watchdog warned that morale is low among DHS workers at the facility, and “corrective action is critical to the immediate health and safety needs of detainees.”"
"William Barr dishes on what Huber, Horowitz, and Durham are investigating",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/william-barr-dishes-on-what-huber-horowitz-and-durham-are-investigating,"Attorney General William Barr gave his clearest explanation yet of the various “investigations of the investigators” being carried out by the Justice Department.

In an interview with CBS’s Jan Crawford, Barr described what tasks U.S. Attorney John Durham, Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz, and U.S. Attorney John Huber have been assigned regarding the origins of the Trump-Russia investigation and the conduct of the DOJ and FBI as they carried it out.

Following pressure from congressional Republicans, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced in March 2018 that Huber, a U.S. attorney from Utah, had been picked to review any misconduct by the DOJ and FBI. Some Republicans had been calling for a second special counsel.

Huber’s long-running inquiry has long been shrouded in mystery, but Barr revealed Horowitz and Durham have taken over most of his responsibilities.

Barr said “Huber had originally been asked to take a look at the FISA applications and the electronic surveillance” but that he then “stood back and put that on hold while the Office of Inspector General was conducting its review.”

Barr said Huber “was essentially on standby” in the event that Horowitz “referred a matter to him to be handled criminally.” That apparently has not been necessary, as Barr said “he has not been active on this front in recent months.” Barr said Durham would now be taking over Huber’s role in handling any criminal referrals from Horowitz and Huber’s involvement with Trump-Russia matters was done.

Sessions had also asked Huber in 2017 to look into issues related to the sale of Uranium One and allegations that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had been improperly involved in the process, as well as broader claims of corruption at the Clinton Foundation. Barr seemed to suggest that what evidence Huber found, if any, may soon be revealed.

""The other issues [Huber has] been working on relate to Hillary Clinton” are ""winding down and hopefully we'll be in a position to bring those to fruition,"" Barr said.

[ Also read: William Barr responds to critics of his reputation: 'Everyone dies']

In regards to the DOJ inspector general investigation, Barr said he would not describe Horowitz’s role as small, but rather as very specific. “He’s looking at a discrete area that is, you know, important, which is the use of electronic surveillance that was targeted at Carter Page,"" Barr said. Page was a former Trump campaign adviser who was surveilled by the DOJ and the FBI for months beginning in October 2016.

More than a year ago, in March 2018, Horowitz announced the start of the FISA abuse investigation, saying he was doing so following requests from Sessions and Republican members of Congress. GOP lawmakers alleged the DOJ and FBI had abused the FISA process and misled the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court in their investigation and surveillance of Trump and his associates during the campaign and Trump's administration.

At the time, the inspector general's office said it would “examine the Justice Department’s and the FBI’s compliance with legal requirements, and with applicable DOJ and FBI policies and procedures, in applications filed with the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) relating to a certain U.S. person.” That “certain U.S. person” is Page.

The DOJ inspector general also said it would “review information that was known to the DOJ and the FBI at the time the applications were filed from or about an alleged FBI confidential source. Additionally, the OIG will review the DOJ’s and FBI’s relationship and communications with the alleged source as they relate to the FISC applications.” The “source” is Christopher Steele, the British ex-spy whose unverified dossier was used by the FBI to obtain FISA warrants against Page.

Steele has communicated in recent days that he’d be willing to cooperate with Horowitz but not with Durham.

Barr, who has said that Horowitz’s probe should be ending in May or June, called him a “superb government official” in this latest interview, but pointed out that Horowitz “has limited powers.”

“He doesn't have the power to compel testimony, he doesn't have the power really to investigate beyond the current cast of characters at the Department of Justice,” Barr said. “His ability to get information from former officials or from other agencies outside the department is very limited.”

That’s why Barr said he selected Durham, a U.S. attorney for Connecticut, to head up DOJ’s newest inquiry. Barr was recently given broad declassification authority by Trump, and Durham will have greater investigative powers than Horowitz has at his disposal. Barr praised Durham, saying, “He has, over the years, been used by both Republican and Democratic attorneys general to investigate these kinds of activities. And he's always gotten the most laudatory feedback from his work. So there's no doubt in my mind that he's going he's going to conduct a thorough and fair review of this.”

Barr defended his scrutiny of the actions of the DOJ and FBI in his CBS interview, saying, “I think it's important to understand what basis there was for launching counterintelligence activities against a political campaign, which is the core of our … First Amendment liberties in this country.”

“And what was the predicate for it? What was the hurdle that had to be crossed? What was the process? Who had to approve it? And including the electronic surveillance, whatever electronic surveillance was done? And was everyone operating in their proper lane?” Barr asked."

Ron Wyden said the Treasury Department's response to congressional requests for the president's tax returns was “unresponsive and wholly unacceptable.” | AP Photo/Cliff Owen finance & tax Wyden threatens to hold nominees over Trump tax return defiance

Sen. Ron Wyden threatened on Thursday to put a hold on Treasury Department nominees unless the administration offers fuller answers about congressional efforts to obtain President Donald Trump’s tax returns.

Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, had pressed Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in a letter this month about the administration’s handling of House Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal’s request for Trump’s returns. He said Thursday that the department’s response — which came not from Mnuchin, but from Justin Sok of Treasury’s legislative affairs office — was “unresponsive and wholly unacceptable.”

“If the Treasury Department refuses to answer our questions, I am prepared to again place a hold on department nominees as I did previously when routine requests for information went unanswered,” the Oregon Democrat added. “Congress needs to take action to force the administration to comply with oversight.”

Wyden had already said last week that Brent McIntosh, Treasury’s general counsel and Trump’s nominee to be Treasury undersecretary for international affairs, “needs to be prepared to thoroughly answer” questions about his role in the department’s refusal to comply with Neal’s request and a subsequent subpoena if he wanted the position.

Several other Treasury nominees could face a hold: Brian McGuire for assistant secretary for legislative affairs, Michael Faulkender for assistant secretary for economic policy, Brian Callanan for general counsel and Geoffrey William Seiji Okamoto for deputy undersecretary.

In his letter to Mnuchin this month, Wyden asked how often tax committees had sought tax return information this century and how frequently that request has been handled by the Treasury secretary instead of the IRS commissioner.

Sok’s response maintained that Neal’s request was “categorically different” than previous committee requests for “statistical data to inform the drafting of tax legislation,” similar to the arguments that Mnuchin has made in public. Mnuchin repeatedly has said that Neal’s stated reason for requesting Trump’s returns — to conduct fuller oversight of the IRS’ capabilities in its routine auditing of presidents — is a cover and that Democrats are merely seeking ways to embarrass the president.

Wyden placed holds on Treasury nominees last year — including Justin Muzinich, Trump’s choice to be deputy secretary — because he believed the administration was stonewalling requests for oversight information. Muzinich was confirmed in December.

Department of Corrections turns over disputed documents to Justice Department,https://www.al.com,"['William Thornton', 'Wthornton Al.Com']",06-01-2019,2019,6,https://www.al.com/news/2019/06/department-of-corrections-turns-over-disputed-documents-to-justice-department.html,"The Alabama Department of Corrections surrendered documents this week that the U.S. Department of Justice said dealt with reports of excessive force and sexual abuse against inmates by correctional officers.

According to a four-page motion filed Thursday by lawyers representing the DOJ, the ADOC provided documents “specifically related to use of force and sexual abuse by staff.” As a result, the DOJ withdrew a petition to enforce a subpoena that it filed last October.

U.S. Magistrate Judge Gray Borden had given both sides until Friday to come up with a solution to the impasse.

There is no word yet on what DOJ will do with the documents. In April the Justice Department released a report on its two-and-a-half-year investigation into violence and poor conditions within Alabama’s men’s prisons. The DOJ concluded that there is reasonable cause to believe that conditions in the prisons violate the Eighth Amendment.

Last month, in an effort to get the contested documents, Justice Department lawyers said there are still areas of the investigation that have “not been completed.”

A footnote on the first page of the 62-page report on Alabama’s prisons says that the investigation was opened to look at whether ADOC was adequately ensuring inmate safety from physical and sexual violence between inmates, and whether inmates had safe and sanitary living conditions.

However, the footnote stated that an investigation into a third issue - whether inmates were safe from excessive force and sexual abuse from staff members – is ongoing “because the Department’s petition to enforce its subpoena for documents relevant to that issue is pending with the court.”

On Oct. 12, 2018, DOJ filed a petition requesting the federal court force ADOC to turn over a series of individual prisoner investigative files, and documents on open and closed investigations, including autopsy reports on some inmates and some medical records not previously made available at correctional facilities.

The filing also requested weekly reports from ADOC’s Intelligence and Investigations Division from September 2016 to September 2017.

Since 2012, Alabama men’s and women’s prisons have come under repeated scrutiny for staffing and safety, as well as a pervasive atmosphere of documented sexual and physical abuse."
State Department to launch new human rights panel stressing 'natural law',https://www.politico.com,['Nahal Toosi'],05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/30/human-rights-state-department-1348014,"The Commission on Unalienable Rights will advise Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in a move that has surprised and puzzled human rights activists. | Chris J. Ratcliffe/Getty Images foreign policy State Department to launch new human rights panel stressing 'natural law'

The Trump administration plans to launch a new panel to offer ""fresh thinking” on international human rights and “natural law,” a move some activists fear is aimed at narrowing protections for women and members of the LGBT community.

The new body, to be called the Commission on Unalienable Rights, will advise Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, according to a notice the State Department quietly published Thursday on the Federal Register.

Story Continued Below

“The Commission will provide fresh thinking about human rights discourse where such discourse has departed from our nation's founding principles of natural law and natural rights,” states the notice, which is dated May 22.

Several human rights activists said Thursday that they were surprised by the move and trying to learn details. Some privately said they worry that talk of the “nation’s founding principles” and “natural law” are coded signals of plans to focus less on protecting women and LGBT people.

The word “natural” in such context is often interpreted to mean “God-given,” a phrasing that is less common in modern human rights literature but which could signal a religious component, experts said.

Activists and former U.S. officials noted that the Trump administration’s record on human rights so far is spotty at best.

“Many in the human rights community will welcome an opportunity to advise the Trump Administration on where its policies contradict America’s founding principles. There will be much to discuss,” said Rob Berschinski, a top official with Human Rights First.

The State Department already has an entire bureau devoted to the issues of human rights, democracy and labor, and it was not clear whether officials in that bureau were involved or even aware of the plans for the new commission.

The top State Department contact listed on the notice was Kiron Skinner, Pompeo's director of policy planning. Her team acts like an in-house think tank that considers long-term foreign policy strategy.

Skinner drew criticism recently for seeming to suggest that China, a rising power, is such a fundamentally different culture from the United States that arguments about human rights may not have much effect in dialogue with Beijing. Skinner’s defenders have argued she is a serious thinker who probably simply stumbled in trying to articulate her point.

State Department officials were not able to offer details about the planned commission on Thursday.

But in remarks to reporters after this article was first published, Pompeo said the goal of the panel was to sort out “how do we connect up what it is we’re trying to achieve throughout the world, and how do we make sure that we have a solid definition of human rights upon which to tell all our diplomats around the world.”

“It was a project that I wanted to proceed on, and it’s an important review of how we think about human rights inside of our efforts in diplomacy,” he said. He added that while the panel is separate from the human rights bureau, it is “deeply connected” to that bureau’s work.

Former top U.S. officials who dealt with rights issues expressed puzzlement over the commission’s creation.

“On the one hand it’s commendable that the secretary wants to place more emphasis on these issues, given that the administration to date has not been very outspoken on them,” said David Kramer, who served as the assistant secretary of State for human rights under the administration of Republican President George W. Bush. “On the other hand, I’m not sure what this commission is supposed to do that the human rights bureau doesn’t already do.”

“I don’t think this is the advisory committee for expanding rights,” quipped Tom Malinowski (D-N.J.), a congressman who held the same assistant secretary role in the administration of President Barack Obama.

Generally speaking, President Donald Trump and his aides have de-emphasized the role of human rights in their foreign policy, raising the issue only selectively — typically to raise pressure on countries considered adversaries.

The Republican administration has, for instance, highlighted the plight of female activists seeking more freedom in Iran, a longtime U.S. nemesis, but largely ignored similar challenges facing such activists in Saudi Arabia, a longtime U.S. ally.

The administration has made promoting religious freedom overseas a high priority, a move that has delighted Trump’s many evangelical Christian supporters.

But the administration also has rolled back domestic regulations aimed at protecting members of the LGBT community, especially those who are transgender.

It also has cut down sections about women’s reproductive rights in the State Department’s annual human rights report and made attempts to eliminate references to “sexual and reproductive health” in U.N. documents.

According to the notice posted Thursday, the new commission will meet at least once a month. It is not clear who will serve on the panel or when their appointments will take effect, but activists and former U.S. officials noted that its composition will greatly affect the policies it promotes."
US Department of Energy is now referring to fossil fuels as “freedom gas”,https://arstechnica.com,['Megan Geuss'],,,,https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/05/us-department-of-energy-is-now-referring-to-fossil-fuels-as-freedom-gas/,"Call it a rebranding of ""energy dominance.""

In a press release published on Tuesday, two Department of Energy officials used the terms ""freedom gas"" and ""molecules of US freedom"" to replace your average, everyday term ""natural gas.""

The press release was fairly standard , announcing the expansion of a Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) terminal at the Freeport facility on Quintana Island, Texas. It would have gone unnoticed had an E&E News reporter not noted the unique metonymy ""molecules of US freedom.""

DOE Assistant Secretary for Fossil Energy Steven Winberg is quoted as saying, ""With the US in another year of record-setting natural gas production, I am pleased that the Department of Energy is doing what it can to promote an efficient regulatory system that allows for molecules of US freedom to be exported to the world.”

Also in the press release, US Under Secretary of Energy Mark W. Menezes refers to natural gas as ""freedom gas"" in his quote: “Increasing export capacity from the Freeport LNG project is critical to spreading freedom gas throughout the world by giving America’s allies a diverse and affordable source of clean energy.""

Slate notes that the term ""freedom gas"" seems to have originated from an event with DOE Secretary Rick Perry. Earlier this year, the secretary signed an order to double the amount of LNG exports to Europe, saying, “The United States is again delivering a form of freedom to the European continent. And rather than in the form of young American soldiers, it’s in the form of liquefied natural gas.”

A reporter at the order signing jokingly asked whether the LNG shipments should be called ""freedom gas,"" and Perry said, ""I think you may be correct in your observation.""

If the DOE is still running with the term as a joke, then the wit in the Energy Secretary's office is bone dry. Ars contacted the DOE to see if ""freedom gas"" and ""molecules of US freedom"" are now going to be standard in department communication with the public. We are also curious if any potential drop in LNG exports could result in patriotism bloat. The DOE has not responded, though we'll update the story if it does.

According to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), Canada, Mexico, South Korea, and Japan were the top importers of freedom gas last year. China, India, and the UK buy a smaller number of molecules of US freedom."
Here’s Why Bill de Blasio Thinks He Can Be President. And Here’s Why He’s Wrong.,https://www.thedailybeast.com,['Richard A. Greenwald'],06-01-2019,2019,6,https://www.thedailybeast.com/heres-why-bill-de-blasio-thinks-he-can-be-president-and-heres-why-hes-wrong,"When Mayor Bill de Blasio announced his bid for president, after months of mulling, New Yorkers—76 percent of whom had said he shouldn’t run— shrugged. That’s to be expected. While being the mayor of the nation’s largest city might seem like a perfect position from which to launch a national political career, New Yorkers don’t take kindly to mayors with national aspirations. History tells us that—contra Sinatra’s boast that “if I can make it there, I can make it anywhere”—being the mayor of Gotham is a dead end job.

New York City is one of the world’s great cities. It has been a center of world finance for nearly 200 years. It birthed the original plutocrats of the Gilded Age, along with industrialism in its modern capitalist form. New York City exemplified the age of mass consumption, popular entertainment, and the department store. It has always sat at the center of the news, media, and publishing universe. It is also home to the United Nations. Given the attention, the city deservedly gets, mayors have the sort of recognition and exposure that makes them household names. Yet while LaGuardia, Lindsay, Koch, Giuliani, and Bloomberg all had national reputations, none of them have held an office outside of New York City.

Add de Blasio to that list. He ran for mayor in 2013 on a progressive platform, vowing to take on the hyper-gentrification and increasing income inequality of the Bloomberg era. His “Tale of Two Cities” theme called for serving and servicing forgotten New Yorkers—or real New Yorkers. New York City has always had this thing for authenticity, as a city of immigrants and migrants that has constantly tried to define itself against the same glamourized media images of it the city that help draw people here.

Having foreseen the blue wave rising, de Blasio has struggled to stay atop it. His administration has been defined in many ways by his public feud with Governor Andrew Cuomo— who battled the mayor over housing, education, infrastructure, transportation, and public health—and who swerved hard to the left himself after the election of Trump in 2016, and is now a key supporter of Joe Biden. New York mayors often feud with governors and presidents; this one has been outfoxed and outflanked.

Moreover, that de Blasio’s further left politics are now closer to the mainstream of the Democratic party hardly makes him—after a term of half limited success and with inequality continuing to widen on his watch—the natural standard bearer for a party that’s now full of progressives, including Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and NYC’s own AOC. (Despite having endorsed her opponent, incumbent Congressman and Queens boss Joe Crowley, De Blasio insisted afterward that ‘“Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is someone who absolutely comes from my wing of the Democratic Party”).

For all the media exposure they get, New York mayors also have to overcome the cultural baggage of Gotham to achieve national office. They are clearly representatives of cosmopolitanism, of the vast multicultural landscape, of urbanism, high finance and big money, as well as unionism and social movements and activist politics. In short, they play against every image we have of middle of the road America. And the electoral college means there’s no political gain in running as America’s mayor, as one of de Blasio’s predecessors (whatever happened to that guy?) tried to do a few years after stumbling into that title in his last days in office.

We have always had a love-hate relationship as a nation with Gotham. There is a whole film culture about its destruction, from King Kong all the way through the Avengers. It is a Hollywood trope to show New York in ruins. Books too, like the concrete eating tiger who destroys whole blocks of Manhattan in Jonathan Lethem’s Chronic City. This dystopian imagining of New York plays because to many Americans, New York is representative of chaos and dysfunction because of its sheer size and its embrace of outsiders. Because New York never settles and never remains still, it is always on the make, on the go, always reinventing itself and its past. It seems to many a place without a tradition, only a chaotic present and a future.

Maybe one day, we’ll have a mayor who can overcome the cultural baggage to make the leap. I would argue that we would be a better nation for it. Scholar Benjamin Barber makes the case in his recent book, If Mayors Ruled the World. The skills it takes to master the local political landscape are massive.

A successful mayor is in charge of our largest city, bigger than some states in population. The budget is staggering. The problems are massive. Because of the ethnic populations and the presence of the United Nations, New York City mayors need to have a foreign policy presence. Because of economic realities, they need to promote jobs, industry and because it is also a progressive city, they need to promote equality. They need to worry about homelessness and hunger—not just in theory—and about the nuts and bolts of basic policy. They truly understand that, as former House Speaker Tip O'Neill famously put it, “all politics is local.”

The country could do much worse than a successful mayor of New York City as president. But, it will not be this mayor."
Barr rips 'legal analysis' in Mueller report: 'It did not reflect the views of the department',https://www.foxnews.com,"['Brooke Singman', 'Brooke Singman Is A Politics Reporter For Fox News. Follow Her On Twitter At']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/barr-says-he-didnt-agree-with-the-legal-analysis-in-mueller-report-says-it-did-not-reflect-the-views-of-doj,"Attorney General Bill Barr said in an interview that aired Friday that he does not agree with ""a lot of the legal analysis"" inside Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report and said it does “not reflect the views” of the Justice Department, the latest break between President Trump's attorney general and leader of the Russia probe.

In a sit-down interview with CBS News’ Jan Crawford, Barr was asked about the handling of his initial four-page summary of Mueller’s report, which he shared in late March. Barr and former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said they determined that the evidence found in Mueller’s probe was not sufficient to charge the president with an obstruction of justice offense.

BARR SAYS HE 'PERSONALLY FELT' MUELLER COULD HAVE REACHED DECISION ON OBSTRUCTION

“We didn’t agree with the legal analysis, a lot of the legal analysis in the report,” Barr said. “It did not reflect the views of the department. It was the viewpoint of a particular lawyer or lawyers, so we applied what we saw was the right law.”

Speaking of Mueller's findings on obstruction, Barr said, “The bottom line was that Bob Mueller identified some episodes. He did not reach a conclusion. He provided both sides of the issue. And his conclusion was he was not exonerating the president, but wasn’t finding a crime either.”

Barr’s comments come after Mueller made a rare public appearance this week—his first and only in his tenure as special counsel. Mueller announced that the investigation was officially complete and that he was resigning from the Justice Department to return to private life.

Mueller detailed the findings of the report, stating that there was “no evidence” of a conspiracy related to Russia colluding with members of the Trump campaign during the 2016 presidential election, and explained his investigatory decisions related to his inquiry on whether the president obstructed justice.

“If we had had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said that,” Mueller said Wednesday at the Justice Department. “We did not determine whether the president did commit a crime.”

Mueller explained the longstanding Justice Department policy, which states that a sitting president cannot be charged with a crime, and added that “charging the president with a crime was not an option we could consider.”

“We concluded that we would not reach a determination one way or the other about whether the president committed a crime,” Mueller said. “That is the office’s final position.”

But Barr told CBS News that he felt Mueller could have come to an official conclusion on the inquiry.

“I personally felt he could’ve reached a decision,” Barr said. “The opinion says you cannot indict a president while he is in office, but he could’ve reached a decision whether it was criminal activity, but he had his reasons for not doing it, which he explained.”

MUELLER SAYS CHARGING TRUMP WITH A CRIME WAS 'NOT AN OPTION' IN RUSSIA PROBE

Barr added: “I am not going to argue about those reasons but when he didn’t make a decision, the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and I felt it was necessary for us as heads of the Department to reach that decision.”

This week, Mueller also said that while the Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) opinion blocks a president from indictment while in office, “the Constitution requires a process other than the criminal justice system to formally accuse the president of wrongdoing.” Some on the left took that as a green light to ramp up talks about impeachment proceedings against the president.

When asked if he thought Mueller was suggesting Congress could be the “venue” to hold the president accountable, Barr said he was “not sure.”

“Well, I’m not sure what he was suggesting,” Barr said in in the interview. “You know, the Department of Justice doesn’t use our powers of investigating crime as an adjunct to Congress.”

Barr also responded to Mueller’s announcement this week that, despite negotiations with top congressional committees, he does not plan to testify in public or private.

“It’s up to Bob, but I think the line he’s drawing, which is he’s going to stick to what’s in the report, is the proper line for any department official,” Barr said.

TRUMP BLASTS MUELLER AS 'HIGHLY CONFLICTED,' CALLS IMPEACHMENT A DIRTY, FILTHY, DISGUSTING WORD'

Earlier this month, the House Judiciary Committee voted to hold Barr in contempt for defying the panel’s subpoena requiring that he turn over an unredacted version of Mueller’s report, as well as underlying documents and evidence. In turn, the president asserted executive privilege over the materials in a bid to protect those files from release.

Despite the criticism of Barr over his handling of the report, Mueller defended him on Wednesday, saying that he does ""not question the attorney general's good faith"" in the decision to release the report in full, with redactions, to the public and Congress. Mueller said that he had suggested only ""portions of the report be released,"" and said that he ""appreciated"" Barr's decision.

Meanwhile, Barr, also has fallen under intense scrutiny over his testimony last month before a congressional committee when he said he believed that ""spying did occur"" on the Trump campaign during the 2016 presidential election.

Barr, since, has appointed U.S. attorney from Connecticut John Durham to investigate the origins of the Russia investigation.

When asked about his use of the word ""spying,"" Barr said: ""I mean, I guess it's become a dirty word somehow. It never has been for me. I think there's nothing wrong with spying. The question is always whether it's authorized by law.""

He added: ""It's part of the craziness of the modern day, that if the president uses a word, then all of a sudden it becomes off bounds. It's a perfectly good English word and I'll continue to use it.""

Barr's review of the origins of the original Russia investigation at the FBI comes amid several other investigations--specifically led by the Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz. Horowitz, for over a year, has been investigating alleged misconduct related to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrants-- a probe that is expected to be complete by late next month. Durham, though, is cooperating with Durham, FBI Director Christopher Wray and CIA Director Gina Haspel.

But last week, the president signed a memo to declassify documents related to the 2016 surveillance of Trump campaign officials. It is unclear what the documents contain, or when they will be declassified.

""I had a lot of questions about what was going on, and I assumed I'd get answers when I went in, and I have not gotten answers that are at all satisfactory and in fact, probably have more questions,"" Barr told CBS News. ""Some of the facts that I've learned don't hang together with the official explanations of what happened.""

He added: ""That's all I really will say. Things are just not...jibing."""

Whether it's chain migration or whether it's a lottery, they won't give us any. And the asylum procedures are ridiculous. No place in the world has what we have in terms of ridiculous immigration laws.""

Trump's latest political move on illegal immigration comes as administration officials told ABC News in Guatemala that they are now targeting transportation networks for migrants with the same focus and effort as drug smugglers.

It’s the latest push by the administration to try to contain the crisis at the border that’s overwhelmed border communities and tested Trump’s “America First"" policy.

Migrants families are arriving in record numbers this year, with officials expecting to handle some 1 million people at the southern border this year -- double the number of last year. The reasons are complex, ranging from poverty to threats from gangs to weather-related disasters that have wiped out farmland.

The Trump administration also blames court-ordered limits on the ability to detain children past 20 days, insisting that has only encouraged travelers to bring children with the promise of a quick release where they will able to live and work waiting for an overwhelmed immigration court system to take up their case.

Critics counter that the president has done little to address the humanitarian crisis in Central America and say his threats to close the border and build a wall may have even encouraged the latest rush of asylum seekers.

Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan tells ABC’s Matt Gutman in an interview in Guatemala this week that he was visiting the country to forge a new relationship with the country's security forces. The goal is to break up human smuggling networks that are charging people some $6,000 to $7,000 to reach the U.S.

McAleenan called Guatemala the ""epicenter"" of the migration issue with 40 percent of the migrants arriving at the border coming from there.

""We've got to work with them here to address these smugglers at the front end of the process,"" McAleenan said in the interview.

That view – addressing the root cause of the migration and going after transportation networks -- has long been pushed by the Homeland Security Department, including under McAleenan's predecessor Kirstjen Nielsen. But with the president's repeated promise of ""America First,"" Trump has shown little appetite – at least publicly – to address the crisis through diplomatic channels and foreign aid.

This spring, the State Department announced Trump wanted to cut all direct assistance to Guatemala, as well as El Salvador and Honduras -- the three countries that represent the vast majority of asylum seekers arriving at the U.S. border.

"DOJ inspector general: Ex-FBI official leaked 'sensitive' info, improperly accepted gift from media",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/doj-inspector-general-ex-fbi-official-leaked-sensitive-info-improperly-accepted-gift-from-media,"The Justice Department's watchdog said a high-ranking FBI official leaked ""sensitive"" information to reporters multiple times without authorization and had improperly accepted a gift from the media.

A one-page report from Inspector General Michael Horowitz released Wednesday concluded that a now-former deputy assistant director with the FBI “engaged in misconduct” by disclosing information to the media that had been filed under seal in federal court, maintaining dozens of unauthorized contacts with reporters, and accepting a $225 ticket from a member of the media to attend a dinner sponsored by the media.

Despite these violations of FBI policy, the inspector general said “prosecution of the [deputy assistant director] was declined.”

The investigation was initiated by the Office of the Inspector General in response to allegations from the FBI, and the inspector general said that it is now “providing this report to the FBI for appropriate action.”

When the Washington Examiner reached out to the DOJ inspector general’s office for further information about the investigation, including the identity of the unnamed deputy assistant director, a senior counsel said to file a Freedom of Information Act request with their office.

During a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing this month, Sen. Chuck Grassley told Attorney General William Barr “there have been a number of leaks coming out of the Justice Department and FBI during high-profile investigations” and that “leaks undermine the ability of investigators to investigate.” Barr assured him that “we have multiple criminal leak investigations underway.”

[ Related: Doug Collins suspects ex-FBI leaker is Peter Strzok]

The inspector general said in its report Wednesday that the investigation stemmed from one of many episodes referenced in the office’s bombshell 2018 report titled “Review of Allegations Regarding Various Actions by the Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Advance of the 2016 Election.” That inspector general inquiry, which focused on the conduct of the DOJ and FBI during the “Midyear Exam” investigation into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server, concluded that members of both the department and the bureau acted improperly.

The 568-page tome that dropped nearly a year ago described “a culture of unauthorized media contacts” within the FBI and had a section focused on “dozens of FBI employees that had contact with members of the media,"" many in violation of FBI policies. Horowitz said “the harm caused by leaks” and “the fear of potential leaks” actually “influenced FBI officials who were advising then Director Comey on consequential investigative decisions in October 2016.”

The 2018 report said investigators “identified instances where FBI employees received tickets to sporting events from journalists, went on golfing outings with media representatives, were treated to drinks and meals after work by reporters, and were the guests of journalists at nonpublic social events.” Horowitz said “we do not believe the problem is with the FBI’s policy, which we found to be clear and unambiguous,” but instead “we concluded that these leaks highlight the need to change what appears to be a cultural attitude.”

A February 2018 report from Horowitz found former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe had improperly disclosed information to the Wall Street Journal confirming the existence of a Clinton Foundation investigation. That report determined McCabe “lacked candor” when speaking with former FBI Director James Comey, with the FBI’s Internal Investigations Section, and with the Office of the Inspector General. Then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions fired McCabe in March 2018 just a couple days before he was set to retire.

Former FBI General Counsel James Baker, who has been making the rounds on cable news shows defending his role in the Trump-Russia investigation and his handling of the Steele dossier over the past few weeks, recently confirmed the existence of a likely criminal leaks investigation into him, but declined to provide many specifics. “I am confident that I did nothing wrong and nothing illegal,"" Baker said. That probe was handled by U.S. Attorney John Durham, who was recently picked by Barr to head up the investigation of the investigators who ran the Trump-Russia probe.

Besides looking into criminal leaks, Horowitz is also handling a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act abuse investigation that is expected to wrap up in May or June."

EPA finalizes plan to expand ethanol use,https://abcnews.go.com,['Abc News'],,,,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/epa-finalizes-plan-expand-ethanol-gasoline-summer/story?id=63397761,"Gasoline that contains a higher percentage of ethanol should be available to drivers around the country this summer, the Trump administration announced Friday.

The Environmental Protection Agency finalized a proposal to lift limits on the amount of ethanol in gasoline, saying it will expand the market for biofuels and generate a win for corn producers. Industry groups also said it will help the biofuel industry and give consumers more options at the pump.

“As President Trump promised, EPA is approving the year-round sale of E15 in time for summer driving season, giving drivers more choices at the pump,"" EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler said in a press release.

Trump said he would ask for the change at a campaign rally last March, months before the midterm elections. Expanding ethanol is seen as a way to boost markets for corn produced in Midwestern states and benefit political candidates that support expanded ethanol production.

The head of EPA’s air office, Bill Wehrum, said the proposal helps support renewable fuels and addresses concerns from the oil industry about the regulation of biofuels.

The EPA originally set limits on gasoline with 15% ethanol because of concerns the higher temperatures in the summer could lead to more air pollution. But Wehrum said he doesn't expect a noticeable impact because gasoline with 10% ethanol is already sold in the summer months.

""At the end of the day from an environmental standpoint this doesn't make any significant difference,"" he told reporters Friday.

Critics see the decision as an attempt by Trump to help farmers in the Midwest who have been hurt by the trade war with China and declining commodity prices. Corn growers have called for the administration to allow more ethanol and have opposed waivers from oil refineries exempting them from requirements to include a minimum amount of ethanol.

Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue also applauded the decision in a statement, saying it will help farmers and consumers while the administration looks to grow the market for American-produced ethanol both in the U.S. and in other countries.

Many farmers are facing historic delays in planting corn crops due to severe flooding. Other efforts to help struggling farmers in states impacted by natural disasters have stalled in Congress."
Justice Department asks Supreme Court to move quickly on DACA,https://www.cnn.com,"['Ariane De Vogue', 'Cnn Supreme Court Reporter']",05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/29/politics/daca-supreme-court/index.html,"Washington (CNN) A frustrated Trump administration is asking the Supreme Court to say by the end of next month if it will hear arguments on whether it can wind down the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, an Obama-era program that protects young undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children from deportation.

Such action could mean the court hears oral arguments and issues a decision in the middle of the 2020 presidential election.

As things stand, lower courts have ruled against the administration's attempts to rescind the program and issued a nationwide injunction that keeps it on the books, and the Supreme Court has not acted upon a longstanding request from the Justice Department to take up the issue.

The justices' inaction suggests that some of them believe the issue should percolate in the lower courts before Supreme Court review."
"Justice Department opinions take on the force of law — but are not, in fact, the law",https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Fred Barbash', 'Law', 'Constitution', 'May At Am']",05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/justice-department-opinions-take-on-the-force-of-law--but-are-not-in-fact-the-law/2019/05/30/f4efe222-8280-11e9-933d-7501070ee669_story.html,"The Justice Department issues opinions through its Office of Legal Counsel that have been called “the law that presidents make.” (Amr Alfiky/Reuters)

When former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III declared that indicting a sitting president was “unconstitutional,” some legal experts were taken aback. The question has never been litigated and so never decided by the Supreme Court.

The reality, as Mueller said in the same breath — making his first public comments Wednesday on his Russia investigation — is that the prohibition on charging presidents with federal crimes is “long-standing department policy.” It was formulated in two opinions during the administrations of Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton by the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel (OLC).

The opinions of this elite corps of lawyers are binding on the federal government — but are not the equivalent of Supreme Court rulings.

[On question of obstruction, Mueller hewed to untested Justice Department opinion]

For these lawyers are not “umpires,” as Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. once described the role of Supreme Court justices. They are the president’s lawyers, whose stated responsibilities include “facilitating the work of the Executive Branch and the objectives of the President, consistent with the law.”

The body of opinions they produce have been called “the law that presidents make.”

And it is no surprise that such law holds that presidents are not subject to criminal prosecution.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) said Friday in a blog post that as president, she would seek a reversal of that Justice Department policy. “When I’m elected, I will exercise my constitutional authority to appoint an Attorney General who shares my strong conviction that no one — not even a President — is above the law,” she said.

While the OLC is proud of its “independent and principled” judgment, a recent Cornell Law Review study of its work, as well as a review of its publicly available decisions, suggests that it has a hard time saying “no” to its chief client.

The yeses accumulate. And because the Supreme Court tends to stay away from separation-of-powers issues, an OLC opinion becomes precedent for the next OLC opinion on the same subject, and the next one and the one after that.

Before long, it’s all settled as far as the Justice Department is concerned.

That’s how White House claims of “executive privilege” have evolved. What began as a few historical examples of withheld information by a handful of presidents and a passing acknowledgment in the Supreme Court’s 1974 Watergate tapes case, U.S. v. Nixon, is now routinely invoked by presidents as fundamental law.

The OLC’s recent opinion supporting President Trump’s barring of House Judiciary Committee testimony by former White House counsel Donald McGahn is illustrative, citing “nearly five decades” of OLC precedent in support of Trump’s claim.

Similarly, the OLC cited prior opinions and “centuries of historical practice and precedents” in addition to its interpretation of the law, when it determined that Trump could name Matthew G. Whitaker acting attorney general, temporarily replacing Jeff Sessions, despite the fact that Whitaker had held no position confirmed by the Senate.

“Some people have described it as a one-way ratchet,” said Jonathan Shaub, who served in the OLC from 2014 through the summer of 2017. “A president does something. The next president comes along and says, ‘I can do this other thing that’s just a step further.’ ”

The OLC’s precedent, Shaub said, “sets the stage for future presidents, and most favor executive branch authority.”

Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec declined to comment.

Unlike a court, the OLC’s opinion-making process is neither neutral, adversarial nor transparent. Much of its work is kept secret. Some is informal, according to lawyers who have worked there, consisting of emails and purely oral communications.

All this is among the reasons executive branch power keeps expanding, often at the expense of Congress, particularly in areas involving war powers and national security.

On occasion, precedent doesn’t matter so much. The most recent example of that came when the OLC said the appointment of Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, as adviser to the president, did not run afoul of federal nepotism laws.

The decision, dated on Trump’s Inauguration Day, ran contrary to at least four earlier OLC opinions on similar questions.

The office said it had “reexamined the legislative materials” on nepotism. (The federal anti-nepotism law was enacted after Bobby Kennedy served as attorney general to his brother, President John F. Kennedy, and did not apply to Hillary Clinton, who served as health-care adviser to her husband, because a court ruled the first lady was a “de facto” White House official.)

The most famous reversal was the revocation by the OLC in 2004 of the “torture memos” authorized by the same office for the George W. Bush administration after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.

For a Cornell Law Review article, scholar Adoree Kim compared the OLC’s publicly released decisions advising executive branch agencies with those advising the White House and found a sharp divergence. While the office often felt free to say “no” to agency legal interpretations, it was far more obliging to the White House.

“The OLC is deeply deferential to the President and to presidential action,” she wrote, and “this deference is not unique to times of crisis. It is also not limited to the realm of foreign affairs, or to constitutional questions. Rather, the OLC demonstrates systematic partiality toward the President.” The office, she concluded, is indeed the “president’s law firm.”

But “as a practical matter,” said Walter Dellinger, who ran the office for three years under President Bill Clinton, “it is difficult to cut back on opinions expanding executive power,” though it can and has been done.

Deference to the president “is baked into OLC’s culture,” former OLC lawyer Erica Newland wrote recently in The Washington Post. It “proceeds from the assumption that the president is acting consistent with Article II of the Constitution and with his oath of office, both of which require that he ‘faithfully’ execute the laws.”

“But when I was at OLC, I saw again and again how the decision to trust the president failed the office’s attorneys, the Justice Department and the American people. The failure took different forms,” she wrote. “Sometimes, we just wouldn’t look that closely at the claims the president was making about the state of the world. When we did look closely, we could give only nudges.”

Newland left the office in November. “I decided that the responsibilities entailed in my oath were incompatible with the expectations of my job,” she wrote."
Mark Meadows sends referral to DOJ about mysterious UK communique about Christopher Steele,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/mark-meadows-sends-referral-to-doj-about-mysterious-uk-communique-about-christopher-steele,"Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., sent a referral to the Justice Department about a message a top United Kingdom national security official delivered to the Trump transition team a week before President Trump's inauguration.

Congressional investigators told the Hill that in January 2017 then-U.K. national security adviser Sir Mark Lyall Grant hand-delivered a memo to soon-to-be national security adviser Michael Flynn's team that asserted the U.K. government had doubts about the credibility of British ex-spy Christopher Steele. Recent reports suggest Steele had briefed British intelligence officials on his dossier after the 2016 presidential election, and the heads of MI5 and MI6 were made aware of the contents of the dossier by late November.

“A whistleblower recently revealed the existence of a communique from our allies in Great Britain during the early days of the Russia collusion investigation,” Meadows said.

“Based on my conversations with that individual, and the credible timelines that are supported by other events, I made a referral to Attorney General William Barr and Inspector General Michael Horowitz for further investigation,” the North Carolina Republican added. “There now is overwhelming evidence to suggest that on multiple occasions the FBI was warned that Christopher Steele and the dossier had severe credibility issues.”

Steele compiled a dossier that contained salacious and unverified claims about Trump's ties to Russia. He was hired by opposition research firm Fusion GPS and was paid, in part, by the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton's campaign. His dossier has become a flashpoint of concern for Republicans after the declassification of a House Intelligence Committee memo that said the FBI used the unverified research to obtain Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrants beginning in October 2016 to wiretap onetime Trump campaign adviser Carter Page.

GOP investigators learned of the communique's existence within the past few weeks by a whistleblower who was part of Flynn's team and are pressing for answers ahead of Trump's visit to the United Kingdom early next month. Its existence came to light a month after the revelation of a State Department official's notes about an October 2016 meeting with Steele, sent to the FBI, that warned he was unreliable and that he had said he was being encouraged to get his allegations out prior to the 2016 presidential election.

The communique could be significant as it would have been delivered before the FBI applied for three FISA renewals against Page in 2017 using Steele's research. Sources said Flynn was not aware of its existence until he was questioned as part of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation, after he pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with a Russian envoy, and therefore Trump too was likely not told about it.

The possible misuse of Steele's dossier has come into greater focus in recent weeks, including questions about whether the dossier contained possible Russian disinformation and whether former FBI Director James Comey or former CIA Director John Brennan tried to include the dossier in the January 2017 Intelligence Community Assessment on Russian interference in the 2016 election.

At least three federal investigations are looking into alleged FISA abuse, and other matters related to the way the FBI and the Justice Department conducted the Trump-Russia investigation, and several top ex-officials. Among them are Barr's examination of the origins of the counterintelligence inquiry into Trump's campaign. He has tasked U.S. Attorney John Durham to lead the review. Barr says he is working closely with Horowitz, who is nearing completion of his FISA abuse investigation.

Steele is reportedly open to speaking with Horowitz but has declined to cooperate with Barr."
USDA moving ahead with reorganization plan opponents argue would 'eviscerate' research units,https://www.cnn.com,['Sam Fossum'],05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/31/politics/usda-reorganization-trump/index.html,"(CNN) Hundreds of professional researchers at the US Department of Agriculture are waiting to hear where outside the Washington area their jobs will be relocated -- part of a drive by Secretary Sonny Perdue to cut costs in the federal bureaucracy that many workers also see as a way to disrupt climate research and other work their bosses disagree with.

The looming changes have triggered unionization drives, with workers in charge of research grants set to vote June 11 on joining the American Federation of Government Employees, one of the major federal workers' unions, after USDA economists voted to join earlier this month.

One watchdog group opposed to the relocation says the relocation is a ""back-door"" way to cut staff at the Economic Research Service (ERS), which provides research and statistical analysis for lawmakers, and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA), which oversees the allocation of federal funding for primarily academic research across the country.

""If Secretary Perdue wishes to eviscerate ERS and NIFA research that is opposed by the White House, let him make that case to Congress, rather than hide behind an unjustified, criticized plan to force world class researchers to make the decision to uproot their families or leave their careers,"" Institute for Agriculture and Trade senior policy analyst Steve Suppan said in a statement

The Trump administration has been focused on remaking the federal bureaucracy , triggering a steady outflow of career civil servants. The Environmental Protection Agency's workforce, for example, has decreased by nearly 1,200 employees in the last two years, according to federal data -- many of whom were scientists, according to records obtained by the Washington Post

The ERS and NIFA units have produced research with conclusions that contradict the Administration's talking points, especially on topics like the impacts of climate change on crop or livestock production, or how changes in trade or tax policy, like tariffs or Trump's tax plan, can affect US agriculture. For example, two ERS researchers presented a paper last year that suggested Trump's 2017 tax reform would benefit the wealthiest farmers at the expense of lower-earning farm households , according to the New York Times.

The relocation initiative has brought simmering discontent at USDA to a head. The agency, which handles everything from farm management to school lunches, was among those hit by last winter's record-setting partial federal government shutdown . It has seen the largest drop in employee engagement -- a measure that gauges satisfaction and commitment -- falling 6.9% between 2017 and 2018, the most out of any of the large agencies surveyed, according to an annual government survey.

""These are knowledge-based organizations,"" said Max Stier, president and CEO of the Partnership for Public Service, which tracks the federal bureaucracy. ""Employee engagement is directly correlated to performance.""

The USDA says workers will be able to remain in their jobs, but for most, that will mean moving from Washington, DC, to a new location.

Three location finalists -- Indiana, Kansas City or North Carolina's Research Triangle -- were announced earlier this month by Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue. In addition to the relocation, Perdue plans to move both the ERS and NIFA under the Office of the Chief Economist, a political branch of the department.

The USDA said the only goal is efficiency.

""It's been our goal to make USDA the most effective, efficient and customer-focused department in the entire federal government. In our administration, we have looked critically at the way we do business, with the ultimate goal of ensuring the best service possible for our customers, and for the taxpayers of the United States,"" Perdue said in a statement to CNN. ""In some cases, this has meant realigning some of our offices and functions, or even relocating them, in order to make more logical sense or provide more streamlined and efficient services. None of this reflects on the jobs being done by our ERS or NIFA employees.""

But three longtime agency employees, one from ERS and two from NIFA, told CNN that researchers and economists view the move as an intentional decision to undercut their work. All three employees requested anonymity out of fear of retaliation.

These workers described a steady flow of coworkers leaving since Perdue's initial announcement about the relocation plans last year, with one saying they are receiving goodbye emails from colleagues at a rate of roughly two per week.

""People who have families are hanging in limbo,"" one of the NIFA employees said. ""Many of the decisions they have to make are based on the school year and they simply can't make those decisions without any certainty.""

The ERS employee said that ERS employees have been told that there will be a limited number of buy-outs and that they will be offered on a first come, first served basis. The rest will have to choose whether to move or quit. They've been told they will receive some kind of assistance with a move, but those details aren't clear.

A USDA spokesperson told CNN that USDA has not yet determined how many people will be offered separation or retirement packages.

""We continue to openly and transparently share information with our employees, stakeholders and Congress,"" the spokesperson added.

Peter Winch, an American Federation of Government Employees representative who helped organize the ERS union, said that the union will try to stop the move and, failing that, will bargain to help make the transition as ""soft as possible.""

Winch said that there are about 225 NIFA staff eligible to participate in the June 11 unionization vote, which covers all professional and non-professional employees. There were 204 ERS staffers eligible to vote earlier this month, Winch said.

According to notes in the USDA budget, there were 350 staff at NIFA and 320 at ERA at the end of 2018.

The relocation plan has drawn opposition from House Democrats , who included language in their budget banning USDA from using funds allocated by Congress to relocate either NIFA or ERS outside the capital. A group of Democratic senators have also introduced legislation that would bar USDA from moving and reorganizing ERS and NIFA

The USDA's inspector general is also investigating whether Perdue has the legal authority to move the agencies.

Former USDA officials and scientific and agricultural associations have also come out against the plan, arguing that it may push trained staff out the door and pose a risk to the agency's independent and objective analysis.

""ERS is ranked as number three in the world of institutions in the field of agricultural economics, a reflection of our leadership in economic research,"" 56 former USDA officials wrote in a letter submitted to Congress . ""This proposal puts a world-renowned research agency at risk and could set back the federal statistical system at a time when the United States should be leading the world in innovation.""

Other agencies within the USDA are also experiencing tumult.

Last week, USDA announced it will cease operating the Job Corps Civilian Conservation Centers, which help train low-income, rural students on how to respond to national emergencies, and will transfer them to the Department of Labor. Nine out of the 25 centers are expected to close as part of the move, according to the announcement, and a union spokesperson from the National Federation of Federal Employees told CNN that the move will cut more than 1,000 jobs

The ERS employee said that even if the move never happens, damage may already have been done.

""My fear is that the quagmire will continue to bleed us,"" the ERS employee said. ""That's what is so nefarious about all this, just how strategic this feels."""
U.S. police chiefs call for meeting with Homeland Security over immigration issues,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Tom Jackman', 'Reporter Covering Criminal Justice Locally']",05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonpost.com/crime-law/2019/05/30/us-police-chiefs-call-meeting-with-homeland-security-over-immigration-issues/,"

Houston police Chief Art Acevedo presides over a meeting of the Major Cities Chiefs Association in Miami on Wednesday. (Major Cities Chiefs Association/Major Cities Chiefs Association)

MIAMI — The police chiefs of America’s largest cities on Thursday called on the federal Department of Homeland Security to meet with them as their departments struggle with the influx of immigrants from the southern border. The chiefs said they want to hear how federal immigration authorities plan to deal with relocating immigrants to their cities and how they will handle “sanctuary city” status declared by local governments, and the police want a voice in the federal policymaking process.

The Major Cities Chiefs Association, comprising the chiefs and sheriffs of the 69 largest law enforcement agencies in the United States, formed an immigration working group at its meeting here, led by Houston police Chief Art Acevedo, who has openly opposed a Texas law banning sanctuary cities. Acevedo and other chiefs here said they do not take immigration status into account when performing their duties, only whether someone is breaking the law or has been a crime victim. They see immigration enforcement as a federal responsibility, not one for local police.

“From our perspective,” Acevedo said in an interview, “there is no such thing as a ‘sanctuary city’ in terms of taking action against those who would do harm to members of our communities.” Police have long felt that taking on immigration enforcement by routinely checking a person’s status will deter immigrants from reporting crime or cooperating with investigations. Acevedo said there had been a nearly 43 percent drop in reporting of sexual assaults in Houston by its Hispanic community in 2017.

The chiefs’ working group wants to discuss the federal policy on Immigration and Customs Enforcement civil detainers for undocumented immigrants, which a number of police departments and jails have refused to recognize since they are not criminal warrants. They also want to talk about the issue of notifying ICE before releasing prisoners who have immigration detainers. “The immigration authorities have to pick them up,” Acevedo said. “We don’t turn them over.”

Some chiefs told Acevedo that their local social service agencies are being overwhelmed by busloads of suddenly relocated immigrants. “There needs to be a sense of urgency,” Acevedo said, “when we see asylum seekers that are being distributed throughout the country. We need to know what is the plan and what is the impact on public safety. We need to be part of the discussion because while immigration enforcement is a federal issue, these decisions have an impact on the safety and security of the American people, and that is our primary responsibility.”

In a statement, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security said the agency “has repeatedly and extensively worked with our country’s law enforcement officials to address the current immigration crisis facing our homeland and keep our communities safe. In fact, former Secretary Nielsen met with the Law Enforcement Immigration Task Force, co-chaired by Chief Acevedo, this past February to discuss law enforcement concerns and Acting Secretary McAleenan continues to meet with various law enforcement leaders to seek feedback and identify viable, lasting solutions to the ongoing crisis and achieve the Department’s humanitarian and security mission.”

"After the News That Leaked From the Justice Department at 8:34 p.m. on Friday, Life at Google Might Never Be the Same",https://www.inc.com,"['Like This Column', 'Sign Up To', 'The Opinions Expressed Here Inc.Com Columnists Are Their Own', 'Not Those Of Inc.Com.']",05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.inc.com/bill-murphy-jr/after-news-that-leaked-from-justice-department-at-834-pm-on-friday-life-at-google-might-never-be-same.html,"Friday evening, the weather in Washington was incredible: the kind of pleasant, late spring or early summer night when the temperature is so comfortable that you almost forget there actually is a temperature.

I imagine the whole city kicking back, taking a brief respite from the partisan warfare and bureaucratic lobbying that govern much of life.

All of which makes the news that leaked in the middle of it even more remarkable.

Writing in The Wall Street Journal, Brent Kendall and John D. McKinnon first reported at 8:34 p.m. that ""[t]he Justice Department is gearing up for an antitrust investigation of Alphabet Inc.'s Google, a move that could present a major new layer of regulatory scrutiny for the search giant.""

The reporting was sourced only to ""people familiar with the matter,"" which is the classic language for a Washington leak -- and timed for a late spring Friday evening when almost everyone else had knocked off for the weekend.

Interestingly, the Journal report says that the government has been planning the move ""in recent weeks,"" which could coincide with when Google unveiled a series of privacy controls that many critics say are window dressing, designed more to protect Google's digital advertising business (which did $30.7 billion in the first quarter of this year).

Regardless, this won't be the first time that Google has faced off against U.S. government regulators.

The last time around, in 2013, the Federal Trade Commission ""conducted a broad antitrust investigation,"" as the Journal put it, but closed without taking any action -- ""though Google made some voluntary changes to certain business practices.""

This time, however, there are at least five giant differences:

The first is that the entire cultural perception of tech and big tech giants has changed. As recently as 2017, Google ranked 7th on the Harris Poll annual list of the most visible companies in America, ranked by public perception. By 2018 it was number 28; this year it's currently 41st. The second is that this is the Justice Department, not the FTC. As the FTC explains on its website, the two agencies share jurisdiction but -- and I don't know yet if this is relevant, but it would worry me -- only the DOJ can ""obtain criminal sanctions"" in antitrust cases. The third is that in the meantime, Google has been walloped by antitrust regulators in Europe, including multi-billion dollar fines Fourth, 2013 was the Obama era. We're in the President Trump era now. During his nomination hearings in January, Attorney General William Barr specifically talked about antitrust enforcement against the big tech giants. (""I think a lot of people wonder how such huge behemoths that now exist in Silicon Valley have taken shape under the nose of the antitrust enforcers."") Finally, while Republicans control the executive branch, it's not as if Google can count on knee-jerk defense from Democrats in the current era. In fact, U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts who is currently running for president, has been calling for the breakup of big tech companies under antitrust grounds for months.

So, where does this leave Google? In uncharted waters within the United States, at least. As Tony Romm of The Washington Post, who confirmed the Journal report, put it:"

Doug Collins suspects ex-FBI leaker is Peter Strzok,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/doug-collins-suspects-ex-fbi-leaker-is-peter-strzok,"A top Republican wants to know if a high-ranking FBI official who leaked ""sensitive"" information and improperly accepted a gift from the media was Peter Strzok, the former FBI agent who is well known for his text messages displaying a negative opinion of President Trump.

Rep. Doug Collins, the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, wrote letters to Attorney General William Barr and Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz on Thursday with questions about the DOJ watchdog's investigation into FBI misconduct.

In his letter to Horowitz, Collins asked about a one-page report released on Wednesday that found a now-former FBI deputy assistant director “engaged in misconduct” by disclosing information to the media that had been filed under seal in federal court, maintaining dozens of unauthorized contacts with reporters, and accepting a $225 ticket from a member of the media to attend a dinner sponsored by the media.

The Georgia congressman said he has reason to believe Strzok was the unnamed former official

[Related: DOJ inspector general: Ex-FBI official leaked 'sensitive' info, improperly accepted gift from media]

""While the DAD is not named in the Summary, there are several indications the DAD in question is former FBI counterintelligence agent Peter Strzok,"" Collins said. ""For example, the 2018 Report noted, 'Peter Strzok is an experienced counterintelligence agent who was promoted to Deputy Assistant Director (DAD) of the Espionage Section in September 2016.' The 2018 Report also said, '[m]ost troubling, on October 29, 2016, Strzok forwarded from his FBI account to his personal email account an email about the proposed search warrant the Midyear team was seeking on the Weiner laptop. This email included a draft of the search warrant affidavit, which contained information from the Weiner investigation that appears to have been under seal at the time in the Southern District of New York . . .'""

Collins asked Horowitz if Strzok is the individual referenced in the report and pressed the inspector general and Barr on whether prosecution was declined. Despite the FBI official's violations of bureau policy, the inspector general said “prosecution of the [deputy assistant director] was declined"" and the matter was being referred to the FBI for ""appropriate action.""

Strzok was the lead investigator of the Hillary Clinton emails inquiry and opened the counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia in the summer of 2016.

Text messages between Strzok and former FBI lawyer Lisa Page, in which they displayed a negative opinion of Trump, were uncovered over the course of the Justice Department's inspector general investigation into the DOJ and FBI's conduct during the investigation into Hillary Clinton's unauthorized private email server. Upon the discovery of these texts, Strzok was removed from special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation and was later fired from the bureau.

The report, which came out in the summer of 2018, said their text messages ""potentially indicated or created the appearance that investigative decisions were impacted by bias or improper considerations. But the inspector general determined that there was no evidence “improper considerations, including political bias, directly affected the specific investigative decisions.""

Among these texts was a reference to a ""media leak strategy,"" which raised concerns last fall among Republican lawmakers and Trump. Despite warnings about ""troubling evidence that the practice of coordinated media interactions"" with the Justice Department and FBI, Strzok's lawyer Aitan Goelman said the term ""media leak strategy"" in his client’s messages refered to a DOJ-wide initiative to detect and stop aides sharing information with the media. ""The President and his enablers are once again peddling unfounded conspiracy theories to mislead the American People,"" Goelman said in a written statement.

Collins, who set a June 7 deadline, also asked Barr and Horowitz about the existence of other investigations into other former FBI officials, including former General Counsel James Baker, former Director James Comey, and former Deputy Director Andrew McCabe.

""Leaking classified and sealed material is a dangerous, illegal action. The DOJ's declination to prosecute leaks is concerning and only emboldens leakers to continue their reckless actions,"" Collins said in a tweet.

Barr testified this month that the Justice Department has ""multiple criminal leak investigations underway.”"

Opinion | Can a Sitting President Be Charged With a Crime?,https://www.nytimes.com,[],05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/30/opinion/letters/trump-president-indictment.html,"To the Editor:

Robert Mueller’s public statement left most with the impression that the president would have been indicted but for the legal opinion of the Office of Legal Counsel that a president cannot be charged with a crime while in office. This is enshrined in a Justice Department policy that Mr. Mueller had to follow. But this policy is not based on any provision of the Constitution, any law passed by Congress or any court decision.

The policy flies in the face of the principle that no man is above the law in this country, including the president. That is not just a concept. It is the basis of numerous court decisions such as United States v. Nixon and Clinton v. Jones. No case has decided otherwise.

It is time that the policy that handcuffed Mr. Mueller be revisited and abandoned, or tested in court. Otherwise the only consequence for a criminal president is the impeachment process, which is unlikely today with a Senate controlled by the president’s own party.

I believe that Robert Mueller is wrong in stating that he is precluded by law from offering an opinion on whether President Trump’s acts warrant indictment. He relies on Justice Department Office of Legal Counsel opinions."
DHS awards $276M contract for CDM dashboard,https://www.fedscoop.com,['Billy Mitchell'],05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.fedscoop.com/continuous-diagnostics-mitigation-cdm-dashboard-ecs-federal/,"Written by Billy Mitchell

The Department of Homeland Security has awarded ECS Federal a $276 million contract to provide a governmentwide dashboard for the Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation (CDM) program.

The Fairfax, Virginia, company will receive $7.7 million in the base year of the potential six-year contract, according to data on the Federal Procurement Data System. DHS’s goal is to improve how security information about federal networks is visualized for IT personnel in agencies across the government.

The General Services Administration’s FEDSIM office issued the contract on behalf of DHS’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), formerly the National Protection and Programs Directorate.

The dashboard “will provide a total integrated technology solution for the CDM Federal and Agency dashboards, and will provide DHS with an integrated Dashboard solution for continuous monitoring and mitigation of cyber threats and vulnerabilities to the Federal .gov environment by expanding and enhancing the current instance of the Federal Dashboard through a suite of integrated hardware and software tools resulting in a ‘CDM Dashboard Ecosystem,'” a CISA official told FedScoop via email. “The enhancement of the CDM Dashboard through this [task order] will provide Federal agencies with a user-friendly and intuitive solution that can be utilized to visualize and prioritize risks and vulnerabilities in an Agency’s cybersecurity posture.”

The overall purpose, the official said, is to “provide actionable information to allow agencies to ‘fix the worst problems first'” across their networks.

CDM Program Manager Kevin Cox recently described the next steps for the program now that the initial contracts have been awarded and basic tool sets are available.

“It’s a question of: Will the CDM program become this wider sense of getting full cybersecurity solutions in place across all these different capability areas, or will we be more targeted on high-value assets, specific environments, etc.?” Cox said.

Cox also explained how the dashboard will open agencies up to new tools, analytics and business intelligence.

“If one agency has an incident, there’s a greater likelihood that spreads and gets to other agencies or that it’s happening at the same time across many agencies,” he said. “So we wanted to get that visibility.”"

The Paralympic-style competition, which will be hosted in 2020 by the Marine Corps, brings together injured, ill or wounded active-duty service members and veterans to compete each year for the honor of their branch of service.

Events in the 2019 games, which will take place in June in Tampa, Florida, include archery, cycling, shooting, sitting volleyball, swimming, track and field, wheelchair basketball, indoor rowing, powerlifting, and time trial cycling.

""When they win a medal, they win it for their team. And they don't play their national anthem. They play their service song,"" said retired Marine Maj. Gen. Juan Ayala, the director of the city's San Antonio Office of Military and Veteran Affairs.

The games can mean a great deal to wounded service members like Marine Cpl. Mathew Maddux.

Maddux, the Marines' ambassador for the 2020 games, was injured in 2017 when a malfunction in his tank caused a nuclear, biological and chemical system to overheat and combust next to him. The blast left him with burns on his face, impaired peripheral vision, vertigo problems and a prosthetic ear.

Waking up after the incident, Maddux said he knew right away life would be different. Like the Marine he is, Maddux learned to adapt and overcome, competing in the 2018 Warrior Games.

""I was the ultimate champion last year -- did all the sports,"" Maddux said. ""I got a bronze medal in the 4x100, like a relay team.""

More than physically, he says, the games helped him mentally.

""Mentally reassuring yourself that you can still go out there and be an athlete,"" Maddux said. ""Still go out there and still be in a fight.""

Ayala, who the 2015 Warrior Games when he was still in the Marines, says the competition is special.

""They're focused on the recuperative powers to make that athlete feel like he or she are back in the game, they're back in the unit, they're back in the fight,"" Ayala said.

Ex-State Department head of diplomatic security 'surprised' by Hillary Clinton's private email use,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/ex-state-department-head-of-diplomatic-security-surprised-by-hillary-clintons-private-email-use,"The official in charge of protecting State Department staff said he was ""surprised"" to learn that Hillary Clinton used a personal email address to conduct government business.

Eric Boswell, the former head of diplomatic security, acknowledged in a deposition this month that he warned Clinton and other State Department staff against the use of personal emails.

""We also urge Department users to minimize the use of personal web email for business, as some compromised home systems have been reconfigured by these actors to automatically forward copies of all composed emails to an undisclosed recipient,"" read a 2011 memo that bore his signature.

Clinton was a recipient of the memo, but Boswell could not confirm whether the secretary of state actually read it.

Boswell, who stepped down from his position in 2012, said he and other former State Department officials had spoken about Clinton's use of the private email address clintonemail.com as a ""general issue.""

""We were surprised,"" he added.

Boswell participated in a deposition this month as part of a court-ordered discovery related to Clinton’s use of an unauthorized email server during her time as secretary of state. A federal judge ruled that several Obama administration officials would have to answer conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch's questions about whether Clinton intentionally attempted to evade the Freedom of Information Act by using a nongovernment email system.

Boswell also warned Clinton against her use of Blackberry devices in the executive offices of the State Department. In a previously declassified memo to Cheryl Mills, Clinton's chief of staff, Boswell said the secretary of state should discontinue her use of the device due to ""vulnerabilities and risks."" Although Clinton assured Boswell she read the internal memo and ""gets it,"" an email obtained by Judicial Watch indicates she still carried the device ""[a]gainst the advice of the security hawks.""

The debate over whether Clinton's home-based email server, which she claims was set up for convenience, remains alive today. During a hearing with Attorney General William Barr this month, Rep. Louie Gohmert accused FBI Director Christopher Wray of a pro-Clinton cover-up by not pressing the intelligence community for proof that it was not hacked by China.

Also this month, partially redacted documents were released by the FBI that were part of the bureau's ""Midyear Exam"" investigation, which looked into Clinton's mishandling of classified information on her unauthorized private email servers while serving as secretary of state. The documents put on display a sense of alarm among Clinton's staff following what they feared to be a hack of the server and glaring security oversights.

The FBI investigation into Clinton's emails came to a conclusion during the 2016 presidential election. Former FBI Director James Comey publicly recommended in 2016 that no charges be brought against Clinton, who was then a candidate for president, but admonished Clinton and her colleagues for being ""extremely careless"" in handling classified information.

One of the main controversies stemming from Clinton's emails was how a technician managing the server deleted 33,000 emails. The FBI was only able to recover about 5,000 of the emails, which were released in tranches up until earlier this year as part of a Judicial Watch lawsuit. Clinton has said she ""never received nor sent any material that was marked classified,"" but the FBI found 110 emails did contain classified information.

Clinton has long blamed the FBI's handling of the investigation as a reason for her 2016 loss to President Trump."

"States Can’t Block Legal Hemp Shipments Within Their Borders, USDA Says",https://www.marijuanamoment.net,['Kyle Jaeger'],05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.marijuanamoment.net/states-cant-block-legal-hemp-shipments-within-their-borders-usda-says/,"Advocates, industry representatives, regulators, health professionals and marijuana legalization opponents stood up before the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Friday to share their perspectives on how to best approach regulating the cannabis compound CBD.

There are lots of questions, including many related to safety we will need to answer to ensure that FDA is taking an appropriate, well-informed, and science-based approach to the regulation of cannabis and cannabis derivatives, including CBD. — Dr. Ned Sharpless (@FDACommissioner) May 31, 2019

The first-of-its-kind public meeting is meant to inform the FDA’s approach as it considers developing alternative pathways to regulate cannabidiol, which is not currently permitted in the food supply or as a dietary supplement.

Here’s a look at the discussions that took place at the event:

Advocates and opponents

Jonathan Miller, general counsel at U.S. Hemp Roundtable, said there is “an urgent need for an efficient regulatory framework for CBD” and noted that it was the intent of Congress to provide for the marketing of hemp-derived CBD products when it passed the 2018 Farm Bill, federally legalizing the crop and its derivatives.

Interestingly, Miller said his organization has been working with lawmakers in recent weeks to draft standalone legislation to regulate CBD if the FDA determines that the task is too complicated for the agency to complete on its own. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), who led the charge on hemp legalization, previously suggested that further legislative action may be necessary to unlock the full potential of the hemp economy.

The National Cannabis Industry Association (NCIA), which represents a wide range of industry stakeholders, made a similar argument in its testimony.

Andrew Kline, the group’s director of public policy, said “we strongly recommend [that] FDA act quickly to clarify the regulatory environment.”

“Because there are significant confusions in the market, businesses don’t know what is legally permissible and some are making health claims in the absence of clear regulatory guidance,” he said. “Most significantly, banks and payment processors don’t understand [the regulatory rules] and as a result many CBD companies are at risk of losing financial services.”

NCIA also provided the panel with extensive written testimony it compiled from more than 100 industry representatives, scientists and attorneys in support of establishing clear regulatory guidelines for CBD.

“The bottom line is this: an overwhelming preponderance of evidence indicates that cannabis and cannabis-derived compounds present minimal safety concerns,” Kline said. He added that the FDA should create universal testing and labeling requirements to “help protect the public from health and safety risks.”

On the opposing side, members of the anti-legalization group Smart Approaches to Marijuana (SAM) Canada and the Marijuana Victims Alliance offered testimony that touched on CBD regulations but mostly served to express opposition to marijuana reform more broadly.

“The public is up against a narrative that is at war with science,” SAM Canada’s Pamela McColl said. She claimed that marijuana is addictive, leads people to harm themselves and damages DNA.

“The subversion of truth and science and what is going on in North America [is a source of] great concern and reason to pause and do risk assessments on these drugs and analyze the influence of the billionaires and in the industry that have influenced public sentiment and dictated a very deceitful campaign,” she said.

Sally Schindel, the representative from Marijuana Victims Alliance, said that her son committed suicide, which she attributed in large part to his cannabis use.

“What we need is our federal government enforcing federal laws,” she said. “We need FDA to be more involved and take a leading role in marijuana research and policy formation.”

Shawn Hauser, a hemp and cannabinoid attorney with the law firm Vicente Sederberg LLP, represented the Cannabis Trade Federation at the hearing. “The appropriate regulation of products containing lawful cannabinoids already exists, and that data arising out of the state-regulated regime supports such regulation,” she said.

But “whether right or wrong, the current situation has created a vacuum. It opens the door to bad actors,” which ought to inform the FDA’s next steps.

“Cannabis products can be safely regulated under the existing dietary supplement framework and where products are intended for non-medicinal purposes, it is appropriate to regulate them as such,” she said. “The years of data from these state regulatory regimes are an important source of data for the agency to consider in determining the regulatory pathway. We stand ready to advance to the next level as a partner with FDA in effective federal regulation of cannabinoid products.”

Regulators

Represents from state regulatory agencies in Virginia, Florida, North Carolina and Pennsylvania also addressed the uncertainty that’s prevalent throughout the industry without updated FDA guidelines.

“Currently, states are struggling with the lack of sound scientific research available in CBD and long-term health impacts, including those to children,” Pam Miles of the Virginia Department of Agriculture, said. She added that her department “is hopeful that FDA will begin to supply significant leadership as it related to CBD, including research related to its health impacts.”

Brenda Morris, representing the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, talked about the “patchwork of laws” surrounding CBD and how that has fostered an environment where “anything is allowed.”

“Without the FDA’s guidance and leadership, individual states may carve out their own regulatory exceptions for CBD,” Joseph Reardon of the North Carolina Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, said, noting that his state’s hemp industry has greatly expanded in recent years. “We urge the FDA to resolve the statutory issues and properly establish a legal pathway for CBD products to enter the market place.”

Health and consumer advocates

The Alzheimer’s Association argued that existing research is insufficient to substantiate claims about the therapeutic potential of cannabis for Alzheimer’s and dementia. The group said the “lack of evidence creates a substantial risk for individuals and their families.”

The American Epilepsy Society expressed similar concerns, despite CBD being an FDA-approved drug in the treatment of seizures in the form of Epidiolex.

“We support reducing regulatory barriers to research of cannabis-derived compounds,” a representative for the group said. “We strongly urge the FDA to classify the compounds and drugs under the complete jurisdiction of the FDA. We also advocate for ongoing studies on the efficacy of cannabis drugs.”

Ashley Morgan of the American Veterinary Medical Association told the FDA panel that “we believe there is therapeutic potential in the development of cannabis-derived and cannabis-related compounds and we would like to see the potential realized.”

“We believe FDA must seriously consider the need for efficacy and safety data when therapeutic claims are made” about CBD products, she said. “To facilitate the development of such products for veterinary use is imperative [for the FDA to] provide pathways to ensure the regulatory clarity and predictability and economic viability of the industry. The agency must make enforcement priorities known and consistently and intentionally act on the priorities.”

Another interesting testimony came from Larry Walker at the University of Mississippi, which is currently the site of the nation’s only federally authorized marijuana manufacturer for research purposes. He raised some concerns about potential adverse effects of CBD but made a series of recommendations to the FDA about how to minimize risks.

“A possible path forward, it seems to us, is prudent to have a multitrack approach with these products that are cannabis-related,” Walker said.

“It would be outstanding if the FDA could conduct some basic studies in this realm. It is a national need,” he said. “We need a national testing program for cannabinoid quality and standardization, a national adverse reporting program for whatever products are out there and a rapid response program for products where there are serious incidents. We need analytical backup on many of these things where the serious incidents have occurred. Finally, if possible, together research outcomes in the state medical programs.”

Sue Sisley, an internal medicine physician at the Scottsdale Research Institute, expressed frustration over the fact that the DEA “has not processed” applications to increase the number of authorized manufacturers for research-grade cannabis “despite members of Congress repeatedly urging” the agency to do so.

“Sadly, because of the limitations with the current drug supply, we are forced to import study drugs from a Canadian manufacturer and that is disappointing to us,” she said. “We would like to see our own domestic variety of domestic manufacturers. The point is that researchers need access to options. Scientists need options when it is to embolden scientific freedom.”

James Beck, representing the Parkinson’s Foundation, noted that while traditional pharmaceuticals can treat some of the symptoms Parkinson’s patients experience, many remain unaddressed, leaving the community “seeking alternative ways in which to control the symptoms.”

He said that marijuana doesn’t seem to treat tremors, but “it may be helpful on a targeted level for nonmotor symptoms, sleep, anxiety.”

“Bottom line, we really need more research to understand the utility of cannabis for Parkinson’s disease,” Beck said. “I don’t know that there’s very other circumstances we have a drug that is life-saving.”

Jacqueline French of the Epilepsy Foundation said that the group wants the FDA to “preserve access to CBD for those who need it as a life-saving medication.” However, she emphasized the need to create “manufacturing standards” to avoid contamination from mold and other contaminants.

Americans for Safe Access’s Heather Despres talked about standards that her organization has developed, recommending that the FDA consider integrating some of their best practices on “cultivation, manufacturing, distribution and laboratory operations.”

“There are many challenges facing the cannabis industry. There are solutions available,” she said. “We have worked with state regulators to develop and implement a standard, [and] we look forward to working with you, together, to help implement those standards.”

FDA reaction

Amy Abernethy, the FDA principal deputy commissioner who helped organize the public meeting, identified several themes that emerged during the talks.

In general, there is a need to “further clarify the regulatory framework to reduce confusion in the market,” to provide that clarification in timely manner, to collect data on CBD to ensure that the products are safe and to create labeling standards so consumers know what they’re getting.

Here is some of what I am hearing… First, there is a need to further clarify the regulatory framework to reduce confusion in the market. The product questions apply to people and animals. — Dr. Amy Abernethy (@DrAbernethyFDA) May 31, 2019

Key questions about product safety need to be addressed. Data are needed to determine safety thresholds for CBD; datasets/information should be objective, of adequate quality and available for transparent review. Lab testing and data analyses need to be replicable. — Dr. Amy Abernethy (@DrAbernethyFDA) May 31, 2019

Consumers need consistent information and labeling. State/government entities need support in knowing what to do. And we really need to understand the implications for children when they take CBD-containing products at different dosage ranges. More updates later today. — Dr. Amy Abernethy (@DrAbernethyFDA) May 31, 2019

Another theme that seemed to develop is the lack of information about dosing guidelines. Several experts who testified were unable to give clear answers to the FDA panel when asked about what the proper doses are in different contexts, and what their affects on consumers are.

Many people use these products. For CBD, info presented suggests that many consumers think that regulatory pathways are fully in place to keep products safe. Meanwhile speakers reinforced that regulatory pathways are unclear. We must sort this out in service of public health. — Dr. Amy Abernethy (@DrAbernethyFDA) May 31, 2019

Today’s meeting illuminated many different issues encountered by manufacturers, researchers, local governments, etc (e.g., labeling, marketing, access to research product, terminology, manufacturing, standards). — Dr. Amy Abernethy (@DrAbernethyFDA) May 31, 2019

Systematic studies are needed. It sounds like a number of studies are available or underway. We also wonder if real-world evidence derived from electronic health records, personal monitors, administrative data, etc, can be used to address critical questions in this space. — Dr. Amy Abernethy (@DrAbernethyFDA) May 31, 2019

I suspect that the public docket will expand our understanding, add new information, and reinforce observations today. We will work as quickly as possible to define a way forward. Appreciate a speaker’s observation: “You guys have a tough job. Good luck with that.” Indeed. — Dr. Amy Abernethy (@DrAbernethyFDA) May 31, 2019

Interested parties can submit public comments to FDA’s docket on CBD issues through July 2.

EPA's Fuzzy Math Not Helping Environment or Economy,https://www.realclearpolitics.com,[],05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2019/05/29/epas_fuzzy_math_not_helping_environment_or_economy_140438.html,"There’s nothing Washington loves better than a false dichotomy. Tax or cut. Spend or slash. Regulate or deregulate. Either you’re for the former or you’re for the latter. Well, that isn’t how life really works, and -- especially when it comes to regulation -- it certainly isn’t how manufacturers think. Everyone wants clean water and clean air, everyone wants an economy that delivers growth and opportunity, and neither idea is in conflict with the other. The challenge is how do we achieve both?

The answer is not to regulate too much or regulate too little, but simply regulate smarter. This is the common-sense idea underpinning a recent policy announcement from the Environmental Protection Agency -- something that manufacturers strongly support and, if fully enacted, something that could have the greatest positive impact on the future of American manufacturing than any other EPA action in recent memory.

Recently, EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler (pictured) ordered his agency to develop reforms that would increase consistency and transparency in the consideration of costs and benefits in the EPA rule-making process. This may sound arcane, but it actually matters a lot. There is hardly any trust or balance in the current cost-benefit equation. Nor is there much transparency in the assembly process for rules and regulations that it relies on. For example, when the EPA measured the benefits of its carbon-reducing rules, it used a metric that counted benefits 300 years into the future. Of the 17 rules the EPA issued between 2000 and 2013 that cost $1 billion or more, more than 97% of the benefits claimed were from reductions of a single pollutant (particulate matter), which almost necessarily meant the EPA double-counted benefits from rule to rule.

On the cost side, the EPA regularly avoids a statutory requirement to examine the impact of its regulations on small businesses, even though small firms make up the supply chain of virtually every regulated industry. It has also displayed frustrating inconsistency from rule to rule in terms of the costs it measures. For instance, the agency’s 2010 fuel economy rule measured only the costs and benefits to cars, despite the fact that the rule simultaneously triggered New Source Review permitting requirements for millions of buildings by making greenhouse gases “regulated pollutants.”

In perhaps the most egregious example, the EPA once considered setting a standard for ozone so strict that the controls needed to meet it didn’t exist. In its cost-benefit analysis, the EPA simply called these “unknown controls” and assigned them a modest cost. We measured the true cost of these standards and arrived at a different conclusion: It would have been the most expensive regulation ever.

No one wins when an agency this important is forced to rely on a system this flawed. Overcounting benefits threatens environmental action by eroding trust in what the agency says and puts out. Undercounting costs threatens manufacturers, our economy and the livelihoods of countless middle-class workers and families who obviously bear the brunt when reality eventually sets in (as it inevitability must). No one should want either of these things, and no one should have anything to fear from a serious, reliable and consistent set of standards for measuring costs and benefits into the future. Having reliable data to go on and smarter regulations based off of that data will go a long way toward getting us all closer to the better future that -- in the end -- every American wants. Greener and cleaner. Stronger and more prosperous.

The EPA has done a good job over the years cleaning up the environment, and regulations are a big part of its success. What manufacturers need now is for the agency to get those regulations right the first time. We don’t want zero regulation. We don’t want massive regulation. We just want better regulation. The way to get there is through a smarter and more consistent evaluation of the costs and benefits that they rely on, just as the EPA administrator himself recently proposed. Now, it’s up to the administrator and his team to issue rules fixing this process for good."
