Congress and Trump Discover Bipartisanship on Immigration—But Only to Increase H-2B Visas for Captive and Underpaid Migrant Workers,www.commondreams.org,Daniel Costa,04-02-2019,2019,4,http://www.commondreams.org/views/2019/04/02/congress-and-trump-discover-bipartisanship-immigration-only-increase-h-2b-visas,"Migrant workers make important contributions to the U.S. economy, and it should go without saying that they deserve equal rights, fair pay, protections from retaliation, and a path to permanent residence and citizenship. Sadly, the H-2B program does not meet any of these standards.

Instead of taking action together to enact legislation that would provide a path to citizenship for the unauthorized immigrants who are in danger of losing their immigration protections and work authorization as a result of President Trump’s efforts to end Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) and Temporary Protected Status, Congress and the Trump administration have collaborated to increase in the size of the main temporary work visa program that U.S. employers use to fill low-wage non-agricultural jobs: the H-2B visa.
This year, employers and corporate lobbyists claimed—as they do every year—that 66,000 low-wage work visas were not enough to fulfill their demand for cheap, captive labor in the landscaping, construction, forestry, seafood, meat processing, traveling carnival, and hospitality industries. Members of Congress acquiesced to their demands by inserting language into the appropriations legislation that is now funding the government during fiscal year 2019, that gave the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) the authority to temporarily increase the annual limit of 66,000 visas by up to 69,000 additional visas. DHS ultimately decided last week to increase the H-2B annual limit by 30,000 visas , taking the total H-2B “cap” for 2019 to 96,000.
Migrant workers make important contributions to the U.S. economy, and it should go without saying that they deserve equal rights, fair pay, protections from retaliation, and a path to permanent residence and citizenship. Sadly, the H-2B program does not meet any of these standards. Instead, the H-2B program—like other U.S. temporary work visas programs—empowers employers to legally exert an unusual amount of control over migrant workers, who often arrive indebted to the labor recruiters who connect them to jobs in the United States. H-2B workers are in effect, captive, because their visa status is controlled by their employer—which means that if an H-2B worker isn’t paid the wage he or she was promised, or is forced to work in an unsafe workplace—the worker has little incentive to speak up or complain to the authorities. Complaining can result in getting fired, which leads to becoming undocumented and possibly deported. It also means not being able to earn back the money that was invested in order to get the job.
These problems, which are inherent in the H-2B program, are well-documented. There are numerous cases of litigation , media reports , government audits , and studies revealing how migrants employed through the H-2B program arrive in the United States with massive debt, are often exploited and robbed by employers, and even become victims of human trafficking. While these most-egregious examples are clear legal violations, much of the abuse and discrimination in the H-2B program is perfectly legal. First, employers control the workers’ immigration status. And second, employers have been allowed to underpay H-2B workers for years thanks to the way the H-2B wage rules work, which have included policy changes made through appropriations riders that have weakened the already-inadequate wage rules and de-funded enforcement. Since U.S. workers are forced to compete with vulnerable and underpaid H-2B workers, wages and working conditions for all workers in major H-2B occupations are degraded. As a result, there’s no question that the H-2B program needs major reforms to protect both migrant and American workers.
Table 1 below illustrates how the H-2B program allows employers to undercut U.S. wage standards. Table 1 shows the top 20 H-2B occupations in fiscal2017 by Standard Occupational Classification code, according to H-2B jobs certified by the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL), and the nationwide average hourly wage for all certified H-2B workers in each of the occupations. The 2017 average hourly wage rates for all workers in the occupation nationwide, according to the DOL’s Occupational Employment Statistics (OES) survey—which is used to set H-2B wage rates, making it an apples-to-apples comparison—is listed next to the H-2B wage. The final column shows the difference between the average hourly certified H-2B wage and the average hourly OES wage for the entire country; this is what employers save, on average, by hiring an H-2B worker instead of a worker who is paid the national average wage for the occupation.

The South Dakota Legislature Has Invented a New Legal Term to Target Pipeline Protesters,www.commondreams.org,Andrew Malone,04-02-2019,2019,4,http://www.commondreams.org/views/2019/04/02/south-dakota-legislature-has-invented-new-legal-term-target-pipeline-protesters,"The new law gives the state the authority to sue individuals and organizations for “riot boosting,” but it does not clearly describe what speech or conduct it considers to be “riot boosting.”

The government of South Dakota has made it very clear that it does not like people who protest the Keystone XL pipeline. The state’s governor has dismissed them as “out-of-staters who come in to disrupt.” And other officials have similarly leveraged long-debunked and harmful tropes, mischaracterizing those speaking out as “paid protesters.”In this atmosphere, South Dakota enacted a new law last week, the Riot Boosting Act . The law seeks to suppress protests before they even start and prohibits people from engaging in full-throated advocacy. It does so by creating a new, ambiguous term: “riot boosting.”
If you’re wondering what that means, so is everyone else, including those who want to speak out. And that’s a big problem.
The law joins two existing state criminal laws that also target such speech, meaning that advocacy could now result in up to 25 years of prison time, fines, or civil penalties — or a combination of all three.
The new law gives the state the authority to sue individuals and organizations for “riot boosting,” but it does not clearly describe what speech or conduct it considers to be “riot boosting.” The law is written so broadly that even a tweet encouraging activists to “Join a protest to stop the pipeline and give it all you’ve got!” could be interpreted as “riot-boosting” should a fight break out at the protest. The law joins two existing state criminal laws that also target such speech, meaning that advocacy could now result in up to 25 years of prison time, fines, or civil penalties — or a combination of all three.
Let’s be very clear: States are within their rights to prohibit incitement of violence — a narrow category of unprotected speech that refers to words intended and likely to cause imminent violence. But these laws go far beyond that by criminalizing impassioned advocacy that lies at the core of our political discourse. They instill a fear among peaceful organizers that their actions or words could be misconstrued by the government as “riot boosting.” As a result, activists are now forced to think twice before even encouraging others to join a protest, let alone train, educate, or advise those who plan to protest. And, because of these laws, they may forgo such speech and association altogether.
That is a clear First Amendment violation—and why we are in court to challenge the laws on behalf of the Sierra Club, NDN Collective, Dakota Rural Action, and the Indigenous Environmental Network.
According to the state’s website , the Riot Boosting Act is a result of Governor Kristi Noem’s discussions with TransCanada—the company that is set to build and operate the Keystone XL pipeline—and other stakeholders. Notably, the state did not meet with Native American tribes or environmental groups.
This comes across loud and clear in the final law, which not only gives the state the authority to sue anti-pipeline groups and activists but also gives third-parties—including TransCanada—the ability to join in. Further, the money seized from protesters through these lawsuits can be used to fund the very thing they are protesting, thereby giving the company an added financial incentive to go after pipeline protesters.
If this attack on protest sounds eerily familiar, that’s because it is.In just the last two years, we’ve seen a rise in government efforts to stifle protests, particularly those led by Indigenous and environmental activists, often in opposition to pipelines . There have been attempts to equate protesters with domestic terrorists and saboteurs . Law enforcement authorities have partnered with private security companies to surveil activists and control protests . Known FBI informants have infiltrated activist spaces and camps. The federal government has implemented “no-fly zones” to black out media coverage during heightened police crackdowns .
And if Governor Noem’s rhetoric on “shut[ting] down” “out-of-state people” who come into South Dakota to “slow and stop construction” of the pipeline sounds familiar, it should. It echoes government attempts throughout our history to justify anti-protest actions by delegitimizing protesters as “outside agitators.”
In 1964, infamous segregationist George Wallace said racial tensions did not exist in the South “except in a very few isolated instances” caused exclusively by “ outside agitators .” He was not alone in attempting to frame the civil rights movement in the South as the work of “outside agitators.” Southern authorities frequently attempted to discount legitimate grievances and protests by Black people as nothing more than an attempt by radical outsiders to sow dissent. They even called Reverend Martin Luther King Jr . an “outside agitator.”
More recently, in 2014, after the unrest in Ferguson, Missouri, the police blamed “outside agitators” for the majority of the unlawful activities. Not only were these claims later debunked in a scathing report by the Department of Justice, they also allowed the police to minimize the harmful impact of their own improper practices that caused the citizens of the city to protest in the first place.
What’s happening in South Dakota is no different. The government has dismissed Native Americans, state farmers and ranchers, and residents of nearby states who opposed the pipeline as outside agitators. But the pipeline, if constructed, would have a substantial impact on all of their lives—including our clients, many of whom are South Dakotans. Moreover, the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline is a national issue, and it deserves a national debate.
Opposition to the construction of the pipeline may agitate Gov. Noem, but the First Amendment guarantees the right to voice that opposition. Those affected by the pipeline’s construction deserve to be heard even if Gov. Noem and TransCanada want them all to shut up.

"Statement From National Nurses United President Zenei Cortez, RN: Sens. Kaine and Bennet’s New ""Medicare X"" Bill Fails to Solve Underlying Problems in Our Health Care System",www.commondreams.org,commondreams.org,04-02-2019,2019,4,http://www.commondreams.org/newswire/2019/04/02/statement-national-nurses-united-president-zenei-cortez-rn-sens-kaine-and,"WASHINGTON - In response to Senators Tim Kaine and Michael Bennet’s “Medicare X” health care legislation, reintroduced today, National Nurses United President Zenei Cortez, RN issued the following statement:
“We nurses find Senators Tim Kaine and Michael Bennet’s ‘Medicare X’ plan to be sub-par and wholly inadequate to address the health care crisis confronting our country. Now is not the time for half measures, while lives are at stake. Poll after poll shows that the majority of Americans favor Medicare for All, and Democrats have an opportunity to show real leadership and put forth transformative legislation that will change our country for the better. ‘Medicare X’ does nothing but put a Band-Aid on our current broken system. The solution to fix our health care is clear: the Medicare for All Act of 2019 (H.R. 1384), which offers real patient choice, without devastating out of pocket costs. The Medicare for All Act is backed by over 100 members of Congress and will guarantee quality health care for everyone.”
“We nurses urge the Senate Democratic caucus to reject these sorts of half measures and instead put their full support behind H.R. 1384. National Nurses United, along with our allies, will continue to build the grassroots movement for genuine health care justice and push to pass Medicare for All.”

The Case for Using Ranked Choice Voting in the 2020 Democratic Presidential Primaries,www.commondreams.org,Adam Eichen,04-02-2019,2019,4,http://www.commondreams.org/views/2019/04/02/case-using-ranked-choice-voting-2020-democratic-presidential-primaries,"To make the 2020 primary campaign more democratic, we should demand a system that takes all voter preferences into account. That system is ranked choice voting.

Sen. Bernie Sanders stands as the current frontrunner of announced candidates for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. Given his small donor fundraising capacity , ability to draw massive crowds , and impressive early polling results , the left wing of the Democratic Party has ample reason to be hopeful.
Ranked choice voting (RCV) has a long, albeit niche history in the United States.
Yet, there is a growing possibility that a Sanders primary victory may be undemocratic. As Sanders supporters know so well, the Democratic National Committee sets rules that, whether intentionally or not, can disempower segments of the primary electorate. And the way convention delegate allocation rules are currently set, tens of thousands of primary voters will likely have no influence in the selection of the 2020 presidential nominee, which, strangely enough, might actually benefit Sanders.
The Democrats allocate delegates proportionally for all candidates that garner at least 15 percent of the vote in a given state. In a highly competitive primary, though, few candidates can meet this threshold as voters are spread thin. As such, voters who support these candidates will have their votes effectively wasted. Early polls suggest upwards of 50 percent of the vote could fall into this category, as only Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden consistently poll above 15 percent .
Sanders could potentially win early states with a small plurality—say 30 percent—with most primary voters split among candidates below the threshold. With enough narrow victories, and the inevitable winnowing of the field, Sanders could win enough delegates under these conditions to become the Democratic nominee on the first ballot at the DNC convention.
The Democratic National Committee and state Democratic parties make the rules, so Sanders is by no means to blame for this situation. And barring some major shift, whichever candidate eventually wins will suffer from an equally appalling number of wasted votes. For a mass movement-based candidacy that, at its core is about empowering Americans in the political process, though, there is an onus to at least highlight the problem and attempt to fix it, especially if a solution is obtainable—which it is.
To avoid undemocratic allocation of delegates, states could implement ranked choice voting for the presidential primaries .
Ranked choice voting (RCV) has a long, albeit niche history in the United States, but its most famous application is in Maine , where the system determines federal elections. RCV’s basic premise is simple : allow voters to rank candidates in order of preference, and if no candidate reaches a given threshold—in most cases a majority of the vote—the last place candidate’s votes are re-allocated according to his or her voters’ second choices. This process continues until a candidate reaches the threshold. In the presidential primaries, RCV would sequentially reallocate the votes of candidates below 15 percent until all remaining candidates are above 15 percent—minimizing wasted votes.
Not all states will be able to implement ranked choice voting in time for the 2020 primary. For one, as Rob Richie, CEO of FairVote, explains, “Few states have a turnkey solution to run RCV easily in primaries”, as many states use outdated, RCV-incompatible voting machine technology. Moreover, according to Richie, state parties will have to include RCV provisions in their final delegate allocation plans due by early May and any requisite state laws must be passed—big tasks to accomplish on a short timeframe. Fortunately, there is a growing RCV movement in key early primary and caucus states that may well clear these hurdles.
The most substantial progress on RCV has been made in caucus states. Caucuses, unlike primaries, are run entirely by the political parties, so no legislation is required to make a change. And state parties are rising to the occasion. In February, the Iowa Democratic Party proposed using ranked choice voting for those who cannot attend the in-person caucus . The Nevada , Hawaii and Alaska Democratic parties recently followed suit, integrating ranked choice voting in their delegate allocation plans.
“Caucus states are a logical place to win RCV first,” Richie notes. “Voters in caucuses have more power than in primaries because they get a backup choice. Once caucuses allowed early voting to expand the electorate [after new DNC rules were issued ], RCV was the best way to give them the same power of a backup choice.”
Legislative efforts are also underway to reform the Maine and New Hampshire primaries. On Wednesday, March 20, dozens of Maine voters arrived at the Maine Veterans and Legal Affairs Committee to testify in support of LD 1083, a bill to expand the state’s use of ranked choice voting to the presidential primaries and general election. LD 1083 has a real chance of passing, as no one reportedly testified against it and the bill has the support of Senate leadership .
“Maine voters have made it clear they support having more choice in their elections and the bill to allow that for the highest office in the land looks on target to pass in time for 2020,” former Maine State Representative and longtime RCV advocate Diane Russell tells In These Times.
Across the border in New Hampshire, a small but dedicated coalition of state legislators and voters have advanced the issue. (In full disclosure, I have been helping lead this effort.) In January, an omnibus RCV bill was introduced in the state house and was met with significant public support. What was scheduled to be a 30-minute hearing on the bill in the House Election Law Committee lasted almost two hours, with the vast majority of speakers testifying in favor of the measure. The bill ultimately failed to advance out of committee , but there is now growing interest in passing a presidential primary bill in the state senate .
Even if RCV fails to make it into the 2020 primary, energy directed towards this fight is hardly in vain. The push for RCV in presidential primaries is happening in the context of a growing movement for RCV in state elections . In Massachusetts, for example, advocates are preparing to put RCV on the ballot in 2020—that is, if they don’t pressure state legislators to pass it first.
At this point, it is a complete unknown which presidential candidate RCV would benefit. But Sanders and his supporters should vocally support presidential primary RCV regardless, for when it comes to democracy, the goal must be inclusion over self-interest. And if Sanders were to win the primary, he could transform concerns about democratic legitimacy into a campaign pitch, pointing to wasted votes as another example of the broken democracy we all need to fix.

The Government’s System of Censoring Its Former Employees Is Unconstitutional,www.commondreams.org,Vera Eidelman,04-02-2019,2019,4,http://www.commondreams.org/views/2019/04/02/governments-system-censoring-its-former-employees-unconstitutional,"The system is so opaque that many others aren’t even aware of their obligations to submit
by Vera Eidelman , Ramya Krishnan 0 Comments This broken system violates the First Amendment because it infringes both the authors’ right to speak as well as the public’s right to hear them. (Photo: Victoria Pickering/ Flickr)
Individuals don’t lose their First Amendment rights by entering into government service. By now, that is black letter law. You wouldn’t know this, though, from the system of lifelong censorship that the government imposes on former intelligence agency employees and military personnel.Under this system, known as “prepublication review,” millions of former public servants must submit their writing to the government for review prior to publication. And the government can censor their words with very few constraints. The review process frequently results in delays, sometimes severe ones, that prevent the people who know the most about how the government actually works from contributing to critical public debates. And the associated frustrations often cause authors to self-censor or sit out debates entirely.
On Tuesday, the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University and the ACLU filed a lawsuit challenging the system, in its current form, on behalf of five former intelligence agency employees and military personnel.
Originally, prepublication review affected a small number of former government employees, mostly those who worked for the Central Intelligence Agency and had access to the nation’s most sensitive secrets. In the late 1970s, one CIA employee challenged the agency’s prepublication review regime on First Amendment grounds, but the Supreme Court dismissed his claim — without briefing or a hearing on the merits of the claim — in a single footnote.
Since then, the system has grown increasingly unwieldy, arbitrary, and far-reaching. Today at least 17 agencies administer some form of prepublication review. Review criteria are opaque and overbroad, and they differ across agencies. Authors have no meaningful recourse to contest unfavorable decisions. Censors have sweeping power to delay publication or to redact information regardless of whether it would reveal bona fide national security secrets. Moreover, the government appears to review manuscripts that are critical of intelligence agencies and government policies with greater scrutiny and more slowly.
This broken system violates the First Amendment because it infringes both the authors’ right to speak as well as the public’s right to hear them. This system also violates the Fifth Amendment because it fails to provide former employees with fair notice of what they can and cannot publish without prior review, and it invites arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement and redactions by government censors.
Even Congress recognizes that the system is broken. Nearly two years ago, it ordered the intelligence community to develop a new set of rules to govern prepublication review. The government has said that these rules are “forthcoming,” but Congress’s deadline has passed, and the director of national intelligence hasn’t given any indication of when the new rules will be published or implemented.
They have been forced to choose between subjecting their writing to an unconstitutional censorship regime or risking sanction.
As former intelligence employees and military personnel, our clients bring unique and important perspectives to matters of great public concern. Yet they have been forced to choose between subjecting their writing to an unconstitutional censorship regime or risking sanction. Our clients take seriously their obligations to protect information essential to national security, and they understand the consequences, including criminal prosecution, of breaking the public’s trust. They believe, however, that the current system is broken and getting more broken every day.
One of our clients is Mark Fallon, who spent almost three decades with the Naval Criminal Investigative Service and two years at the Department of Homeland Security. When he wrote a book criticizing the Bush administration’s torture policies, the government sat on the manuscript for months.
The book, “Unjustifiable Means,” was based entirely on Fallon’s post-retirement research into the voluminous public record of the Bush administration’s use of torture. More than eight months after he submitted his manuscript, the government cleared it — but not until the ACLU and the Knight Institute wrote to six senators about the ongoing censorship, and various news outlets shined a light on the government’s extreme delay. When it finally returned Fallon’s manuscript, the government required 113 separate redactions, several more than two pages long. Eager to finally add his voice to the ongoing public discussion, Fallon accepted the redactions, though they were seemingly arbitrary and diminished the book’s impact. In the end, in addition to delaying Fallon’s publication by many months, the government severely curtailed his ability to engage in the renewed public debate of torture sparked by then-presidential candidate Donald Trump.
Another of our clients — former CIA officer Mel Goodman — waited more than 11 months for his book, a memoir about his time in government that was critical of the agency, to clear prepublication review. When he finally got the manuscript back, the CIA insisted that he redact pages of information that was already in the public domain. He believes the redactions were largely intended to avoid embarrassing the agency, not to protect information that is legitimately classified.
Similarly, our client Richard Immerman — an academic who worked for less than two years in the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) — had to wait nearly six months for a response after he submitted his book on the history of the CIA. He learned that the ODNI had sent his manuscript to the CIA, which conducted its own review and ended up demanding extensive redactions — all of which related to publicly sourced material, including material that the CIA itself had previously published. Although Immerman was able to successfully appeal the vast majority of these redactions, he had to spend another two months fighting with CIA censors to achieve that outcome.
Even former employees who have generally had smoother experiences with prepublication review, like our client Tim Edgar (also formerly of the ODNI), see the requirements of the process — what must be submitted, by whom, when, and for what purposes — as vague and confusing as well as ripe for abuse.
The system is so opaque that many others aren’t even aware of their obligations to submit. Our client Anuradha Bhagwati, for example, is a former Marine Corps officer who has written and spoken widely about her experiences in the military. It was only recently, however, that she learned that, as a former Defense Department employee, she is technically required to submit such works for review, even if she never had access to highly sensitive information while in government.
The government has an interest in protecting legitimate national-security secrets, but the current prepublication review system needs to be overhauled. Any system of prepublication review should apply only to those who had access to the most closely held government secrets and only to material reasonably likely to contain those secrets. The system should provide clear notice of what must be submitted and what standards will guide agency review. It should also clearly limit the discretion of government censors, include strict and definite time limits for completion of review, and require censors to explain their decisions. Finally, censors’ decisions should be subject to prompt review by the courts.
We are hopeful that our lawsuit will lead to a system in which former employees like our clients can participate in ongoing public debates without having to navigate a sprawling and burdensome censorship process that simply can’t be squared with the Constitution.

Major Nurses Union Calls Medicare X Plan 'Sub-Par and Wholly Inadequate to Address the Healthcare Crisis',www.commondreams.org,commondreams.org,04-02-2019,2019,4,http://www.commondreams.org/news/2019/04/02/major-nurses-union-calls-medicare-x-plan-sub-par-and-wholly-inadequate-address,"""The solution to fix our healthcare is clear: the Medicare for All Act of 2019,"" said National Nurses United president Zenei Cortez

Democratic Senators Tim Kaine and Michael Bennet reintroduced their ""Medicare X"" public option plan Tuesday in an effort expand health insurance coverage, but National Nurses United said the bill is ""sub-par and wholly inadequate to address the healthcare crisis confronting our country.""
""'Medicare X' does nothing but put a Band-Aid on our current broken system.""
—Zenei Cortez, National Nurses United ""Now is not the time for half-measures, while lives are at stake,"" NNU President Zenei Cortez, RN, said in a statement .
Instead of embracing incremental measures, Cortez argued, Senate Democrats should line up behind Medicare for All, which would provide comprehensive health insurance to everyone at a lower overall cost to the nation .
""The solution to fix our healthcare is clear: the Medicare for All Act of 2019 (H.R. 1384), which offers real patient choice, without devastating out of pocket costs,"" said Cortez. ""The Medicare for All Act is backed by over 100 members of Congress and will guarantee quality healthcare for everyone.""
Kaine readily admitted that his legislation would not fundamentally alter the current for-profit healthcare system, which has left 30 million Americans uninsured and over 80 million more underinsured.
""We preserve everything about the existing system,"" the Democrat from Virginia told The Hill . ""And we just put one additional element into it.""
According to Kaine's office, Medicare X would ""build on the Medicare framework to establish a public insurance option.""
Medicare X would allow Americans of all ages to buy a public insurance plan, which distinguishes it from other incrementalist plans Democrats have introduced in recent weeks —such as Sen. Debbie Stabenow's (D-Mich.) proposal to let Americans buy-in to Medicare at age 50 .
But, Cortez argued, Kaine and Bennet's plan would not do nearly enough to remedy the systemic problems and immense costs of the U.S. healthcare system.
As Common Dreams reported Tuesday, a Gallup survey found that Americans were forced to borrow $88 billion to cover their healthcare expenses in 2018.
""'Medicare X' does nothing but put a Band-Aid on our current broken system,"" Cortez said. ""We nurses urge the Senate Democratic caucus to reject these sorts of half measures and instead put their full support behind H.R. 1384.

The Feminist Agenda Is Rising—When Will Women’s Pay?,www.commondreams.org,commondreams.org,04-02-2019,2019,4,http://www.commondreams.org/newswire/2019/04/02/feminist-agenda-rising-when-will-womens-pay,"Statement by National NOW President Toni Van Pelt
WASHINGTON - Today, April 2, is Equal Pay Day—marking the number of extra days into 2019 the average woman has to work to earn as much as men did in 2018. Last year, Equal Pay Day was calculated to occur on April 10—meaning that in 2019, women have improved the score by a mere eight days.
The U.S. economy has a structural flaw when it comes to women’s wages. When averaging data for all races, women take home just 80 cents for every dollar earned by men. White women, non-Hispanic women earn 77 cents as compared to men and the gender pay gap is even worse among most women of color. According to U.S. Census data:
African-American women earn 61 cents for every dollar earned by men, meaning that for them, Equal Pay Day won’t occur until August 22, 2019. For Native American women, the pay gap is 58 cents for every dollar, with equity not reached until September 23, 2019. Latinas earn 53 cents on the dollar, and won’t catch up to men until November 20, 2019. Due to higher educational attainment for Asian Americans the wage gap is smaller for Asian American women at 85 cents, but they still earn significantly less than men. Although Congress enacted the Equal Pay Act in 1963, their work is far from finished. We need the federal Paycheck Fairness Act , to remedy its flaws and strengthen protections that ensure women are paid fairly through increased penalties and better reporting for wage discrimination, among other provisions. The bill recently passed the U.S. House of Representatives and we demand that the Senate schedule a vote on this crucially important legislation.
The gender wage gap puts an even greater burden on hard-working women and their families who are already struggling to keep up with monthly bills, health care, child care and an economy that too often leaves them behind. It even has an impact on the pension and social security earnings that women receive in retirement.
When the Equal Pay Act was passed, full-time working women were paid 59 cents on average for every dollar paid to men. Since then, the wage gap has narrowed by just 21 cents- a rate of less than half a penny a year. At the current pace, gender pay equity won’t be achieved until the year 2058.
Let’s move Equal Pay Day back where it belongs—to December 31. The earnings year should end with the calendar year—and not a day longer. The feminist agenda is rising—and so must women’s pay.

Manning—who served seven years in prison for releasing a trove of classified documents to Wikileaks—has been detained in solitary confinement in a Virginia jail for nearly four weeks for refusing to answer questions before a grand jury.
On Monday, Manning's lawyers filed a motion with a federal appeals court in Richmond, Virginia, demanding her release on bail.
""Ms. Manning's conditions of confinement must either be modified so as not to constitute punishment or she must be released,"" said Manning's attorneys. ""Since the jail cannot turn back the clock on punishment that has already occurred, her confinement in [administrative segregation] in excess of 15 days already constitutes an incurable due process violation. She must therefore be released.""

US Government's Refusal to Confirm or Deny It Put American Journalist on Drone Kill List Called 'Chilling',www.commondreams.org,commondreams.org,04-02-2019,2019,4,http://www.commondreams.org/news/2019/04/02/us-governments-refusal-confirm-or-deny-it-put-american-journalist-drone-kill-list,"""The government seeks to shield itself from all inquiry into the process by which it acts as prosecutor, judge, jury, and executioner.""

Lawyers for an American journalist who believes he was placed on the government's infamous ""kill list"" warned Tuesday that the rights of all U.S. citizens are at stake if the country's drone assassination program is allowed to continue.
The organization's comments came as part of a response to the U.S. government's attempt to dismiss a lawsuit regarding its use of the list. Reprieve is representing Bilal Abdul Kareem, a journalist and U.S. citizen who claims he was repeatedly targeted —and nearly killed on five separate occasions—by drone and missile attacks in 2016 when he was reporting on the ongoing conflict in Syria.
Kareem joined an Al Jazeera journalist in 2017 in a lawsuit against the government, demanding that the Trump administration remove their names from the ""kill list"" of potential targets for the U.S. drone program.
If the government manages to have the lawsuit dismissed, legal experts warn it would allow the Trump administration and future presidents to secretly place any American on a kill list without telling them why, therefore stripping them of their constitutional right to due process.
""The government's assertion that it has the right to mark its own citizens for death, based on secret information, without affording them the legal protections offered by the Constitution, is chilling."" —Jennifer Gibson, Reprieve ""The right to due process has been a bedrock of the judicial system, and one of the pillars that support a free society going back eight centuries to the Magna Carta,"" wrote Tom Emswiler and Will Isenberg in the Boston Globe last summer. ""It is the birthright of every American. Gaining a tactical advantage is not worth losing that heritage.""
As Common Dreams reported at the time of the filing, Kareem believes the Obama administration placed him on the kill list and wants President Donald Trump to remove his name, asserting that his inclusion ""is the result of arbitrary and capricious agency action, accomplished without due process, and in violation of the United States Constitution and U.S. and international law.""
The government responded that if those included on the U.S. kill list were to be informed and given a trial, national security could be jeopardized during the court case.
Such a claim suggests that the right of the U.S. to operate its drone program trumps Kareem's—and all Americans'—Fifth and 14th Amendment rights, Reprieve said.
""By invoking the state secrets privilege in the context of designating a U.S. citizen for lethal action, the government seeks to shield itself from all inquiry into the process by which it acts as prosecutor, judge, jury, and executioner of plaintiff Bilal Abdul Kareem,"" said Reprieve and the law firm Lewis Baach Kaufmann Middlemiss , which is also representing Kareem, in a statement Tuesday.
The government, in its motion to dismiss, said that Kareem's due process rights would be satisfied simply by allowing him to present evidence that he has been wrongly placed on the kill list, and that the government was under no obligation to repond.
Reprieve rejected that argument, saying it was akin to ""limiting the accused to unilaterally contending that he is innocent of unknown charges in the hopes of persuading a silent, opaque coterie of government officials not to kill him.""
""The government's assertion that it has the right to mark its own citizens for death, based on secret information, without affording them the legal protections offered by the Constitution, is chilling,"" said Jennifer Gibson, co-counsel for Kareem.
""The consequences of this action are too severe,"" Reprieve added, ""and the right [to due process] too foundational to a constitutional democracy, to allow the government to secretly condemn an American citizen to death.""

'Weak Journalism': NYT Fails to Disclose Op-Ed Writer's Close Family Ties to Venezuelan Opposition Leader,www.commondreams.org,commondreams.org,04-02-2019,2019,4,http://www.commondreams.org/news/2019/04/02/weak-journalism-nyt-fails-disclose-op-ed-writers-close-family-ties-venezuelan,"Newspaper keeps from readers that author's father was recently appointed to powerful position by opposition leader Juan Guaidó
by Eoin Higgins, Comedian Joanna Hausmann argues for U.S. intervention in Venezuela in a New York Times op ed. (Photo: screenshot, Times op ed video)
A recent video opinion piece published by The New York Times intended to drum up support for U.S. involvement in Venezuela failed to disclose the author's ties to the opposition government, leading to criticism from progressives of the paper's coverage.
Joanna Hausmann, a comedian who posts highly viewed articles on Venezuela on YouTube, delivered a five minute, thirteen second opinion piece at the Times Monday in which she claims that the country's leader, President Nicolas Maduro, is a dictator and that the American left are his patsies.
""This movement is dangerously glorifying a brutal dictator and promoting inaction,"" Hausmann says in the video as quirky music plays behind her. ""That is the worst combination for ordinary Venezuelans.""
Hausmann also claims that the country's economic problems are the fault of decades of socialist rule and that the path forward is a future without Maduro—it's implied, though never outright stated, that the answer is for opposition leader Juan Guaidó to take power.
What the video and the Times did not reveal is that Hausmann's father, Harvard University economics professor Ricardo Hausmann, currently serves as Guaidó's envoy to the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB). It's a position that, if Guaidó became president, would wield immense political and economic power.
That omission was a focus of criticism from progressives. The elder Hausmann's place in the Venezuelan shadow government is a conflict that should have been made clear in his daughter's opinion video implicitly arguing for American intervention to remove Maduro.
""[Very] cool of the NYT to not mention, you know, the fact that Joanna Hausmann's dad is an economic adviser for Guaidó,"" tweeted Think Progress reporter Rebekah Entralgo Fernández.

— Rebekah Entralgo Fernández (@rebekahentralgo) April 1, 2019 Ricardo Hausmann's past in Venezuela should give Americans serious pause before taking him seriously, Anya Parampil argued in an early March article for Mint Press News .
Ricardo Hausmann is much more than a prominent pundit. He is one of the West’s leading neoliberal economists, who played an unsavory role during the 1980s and ’90s in devising policies that enabled the looting of Venezuela’s economy by international capital and provoked devastating social turmoil.
That translates to his daughter's latest video, Parampil said on Twitter.
""She's not an independent voice but rather the failchild of Guaidó advisor Ricardo Hausmann, a man who neoliberalized and destroyed [Venezuela's] economy once before and wants to do it all over again,"" Parampil said .
Parampil also had some choice words for the Times :
NYT fails to disclose that @joannahausmann is the daughter of Guaidó advisor @ricardo_hausman , who was instrumental in neoliberalizing & destroying VZLA's economy in the 90s & wants to do it again. Weak journalism! https://t.co/IIpKknzat4
— Anya Parampil (@anyaparampil) April 1, 2019 In a response to critics, Times video producer Adam Ellick implied that because Joanna Hausmann has a sizable social media and YouTube following, disclosing her father's close ties to the Venezuelan opposition was unnecessary.
""We were aware of her father's biography before publication,"" Ellick said , ""but Ms. Hausmann is an independent adult woman who has built a popular following on her own, by producing a portfolio of argued videos about Venezuela via her own YouTube channel.""
Observers on social media were quick to cite the Times ' codes of conduct to Ellick in response.

Congress Urged to Boost Monarch Butterfly Conservation by $100 Million,www.commondreams.org,commondreams.org,04-02-2019,2019,4,http://www.commondreams.org/newswire/2019/04/02/congress-urged-boost-monarch-butterfly-conservation-100-million,"WASHINGTON - More than 100 conservation organizations today urged the U.S. House of Representatives Appropriations Committee to increase spending on monarch butterfly conservation by $100 million annually.
Monarchs are currently under review for Endangered Species Act protection. The Center for Biological Diversity, Natural Resources Defense Council and 104 other groups signed onto a letter seeking increased funding for restoring pollinator habitat. Restoration would include planting milkweed, the monarch caterpillar’s sole host plant.
“These magnificent orange-and-black butterflies could disappear forever if lawmakers don’t step up and increase conservation funding,” said Stephanie Kurose, an endangered species policy specialist at the Center for Biological Diversity. “We need strong leadership from Congress if we’re going to save monarchs for future generations.”
Both the eastern and western populations face serious threats like pesticides, severe weather and climate change.
In the past 25 years, the eastern population of these once-common butterflies has declined by more than 80 percent despite gains in the most recent count due to good weather conditions last year. Scientists estimate a nearly 60 percent chance the monarch’s annual multigenerational migration from states east of the Rocky Mountains to Mexico could collapse within the next 20 years.
The western population, which migrates from states west of the Rocky Mountains to overwinter on the coast of California, has declined by more than 99 percent over the past 30 years. It reached a historic low of less than 29,000 total butterflies in 2018, down from 4.5 million in the 1980s. Scientists estimate the western population faces a 70 percent risk of collapse within the next two decades.
The cost of restoring 1 million acres of milkweed per year would be $100 million, based on the government’s own assessment of milkweed restoration costs. Scientists estimate that more than 165 million acres of milkweed habitat has been lost in recent decades. Pollinator habitat restoration is needed to ensure the butterfly has a large enough population size to be resilient to threats.
“These beautiful butterflies are running out of time,” said Kurose. “Congress needs to take effective action to save the monarch before it’s too late.”

Canada is warming twice as fast as the rest of the world, according to a new government report that provoked impassioned calls to urgently address human activities that produce planet-heating emissions.
Canada's Changing Climate Report (CCCR) was commissioned by Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC), a federal government department. It was scheduled for release on Tuesday but leaked to CBC News columnist Neil Macdonald on Monday.
Macdonald called the report's findings ""beyond grim,"" and said they ""trigger thoughts of hoarding and maybe selling the house and moving to higher ground. To a millennial, the findings should inspire naked fear.""
""We are living through a climate crisis,"" the environmental group 350 Canada tweeted in response to CBC 's Monday coverage. ""We don't have any other choice but to take bold action on climate change, now.""

A recent U.N. analysis warned of ""climate catastrophe"" without rapid systemic changes in sectors such as transportation and energy that generate greenhouse gases. In January, a study published in the journal Nature Communications found it is still possible to limit global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels—the target of the Paris agreement—but doing so requires ""ambitious and immediate emission reduction across all sectors.""
""The science is clear, we need to take action now,"" ECCC Minister Catherine McKenna said in a statement as the Canadian government put out its new report. ""Practical and affordable solutions to fight climate change will help Canadians face the serious risks to our health, security and economy, and will also create the jobs of tomorrow and secure a better future for our kids and grandkids.""
McKenna was appointed by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who has been widely criticized during his four years as head of government for his mixed messages and policies on climate—particularly his government's purchase of the Trans Mountain tar sands pipeline, a project McKenna has defended .
""The details trigger thoughts of hoarding and maybe selling the house and moving to higher ground. To a millennial, the findings should inspire naked fear.""
—Neil Macdonald, CBC News
CCCR is the first major analysis released as part of a national assessment the government launched in 2017. Its goal was to examine ""how has Canada's climate changed to date, why, and what changes are projected for the future.""
""Since 1948, when nation-wide records became available, Canada's annual average temperature over land has warmed by a best estimate of 1.7°C, with higher temperature increases observed in the North, the Prairies, and northern British Columbia,"" according to the report.
In northern Canada, temperatures are rising at nearly three times the global rate. CCCR says that ""annual average temperature over northern Canada increased by 2.3°C since 1948.""
The report unequivocally acknowledges that warming is predominately driven by human activity, stating that ""only when human influences on climate are accounted for—changes in atmospheric greenhouse gases and aerosols, and changes to the land surface—can these observed changes in climate be explained.""
""The effects of widespread warming are evident in many parts of Canada,"" CCCR notes, ""and are projected to intensify in the future.""
Its key findings about the country's current conditions and what its future could look like include:
Oceans surrounding Canada have warmed, become more acidic, and less oxygenated, consistent with observed global ocean changes over the past century; Precipitation is projected to increase for most of Canada, on average, although summer rainfall may decrease in some areas; The seasonal availability of freshwater is changing with an increased risk of water supply shortages in summer; A warmer climate will intensify some weather extremes in the future; Canadian areas of the Arctic and Atlantic oceans have experienced longer and more widespread sea-ice-free conditions; and Coastal flooding is expected to increase in many areas of Canada because of local sea level rise. ""The rate and magnitude of climate change under high versus low emission scenarios project two very different futures for Canada,"" warns CCCR. ""Scenarios with limited warming will only occur if Canada and the rest of the world reduce carbon emissions to near zero early in the second half of the century and reduce emissions of other greenhouse gases substantially.""

Why We’re Seeing More Realistic Depictions of Abortion in TV and Film,www.commondreams.org,Jonita Davis,04-02-2019,2019,4,http://www.commondreams.org/views/2019/04/02/why-were-seeing-more-realistic-depictions-abortion-tv-and-film,"Planned Parenthood has partnered with the entertainment industry to combat misrepresentations of women’s reproductive health
by Jonita Davis 0 Comments Since 2016, Planned Parenthood has collaborated with television and film creators to normalize sexual and reproductive health through storytelling. (Photo: Illustration by Alice Moi and CSA Image)
Over 8 million viewers last year watched while Scandal ’ s Olivia Pope, played by actor Kerri Washington, lay on a clinic table as she had an abortion. There was no dialogue about Pope’s pregnancy or the procedure, before or after. Simultaneously, Republican Sen. (and former first lady) Mellie Grant, played by Bellamy Young, filibusters to protect funding for Planned Parenthood.The episode was reflective of a partnership between the entertainment industry and the nonprofit health care provider Planned Parenthood to combat bad data on reproductive health.
Misleading information about women’s health has long informed harmful policy decisions throughout American history. From the colonial belief that women are too delicate to govern to misinformation about abortion and the restrictions placed on reproductive health, these notions have been challenged by advocates for women’s rights and reproductive rights.
Since 2016, Planned Parenthood has collaborated with television and film creators to normalize sexual and reproductive health through storytelling. Involved are directors, writers, producers, publicists, and others, who participate in film festivals such as Sundance, SXSW, Tribeca, and Toronto International Film Festival. These collaborations include providing set materials, sexual and reproductive health care information, as well as staff members to consult on scripts (to ensure information is accurate and offer suggests on where information can be comfortably placed), in addition to allowing tours of their facilities to help creators provide a more realistic depiction of women’s health care.
Through panels, brunches, and event partnerships, Planned Parenthood distributes statistics on reproductive health, including but not limited to birth control, abortion, teen pregnancy, and how abstinence-only programs fail teens. They also provide sex education materials that include the proper terminology for procedures and body parts.
Their project was inspired by the LGBT (the “Q” was added in 1996) community. In the late 1980s, the Human Rights Campaign and other organizations came together to directly respond to misinformation and attacks on LGBT people. Recognizing the influence of media—particularly film and television—they slowly began a campaign to normalize queer culture.
Alencia Johnson, director of public engagement at Planned Parenthood, said that television and film’s impact on the public, and subsequently public policy, propelled them.
“The arts are a way to shift policy, mainly because we’re shifting culture. Over 50 percent of people actually believe that the health care information they see on TV and film is accurate,” Johnson said. “Therefore, we need to make sure that abortion storylines—storylines about sexuality, love, relationships, birth control, whatever it may be—related to gender and reproductive rights are accurate.”
Johnson and the Planned Parenthood team are not working without some good intel. Americans watch a lot of television. The Bureau of Labor Statistics’ American Time Use Survey found that more than 80 percent of the population watch TV as their leisure activity. And, they use about half of their total daily free time to watch TV shows and movies. This creates a captive audience of sorts that is receptive, but only if the content is subtle and in some way connected to some part of the viewer’s own lived experience.
For example, in the aforementioned Scandal episode, very little if any dialogue included the word abortion. But women in that situation could relate. They could also relate to the information about women and reproductive rights spoken by Young’s character.
According to Caron Spruch, director of arts and entertainment engagement at Planned Parenthood, the key is to make the information as normal and easily digestible as possible for older and younger viewers.
“I believe art is supposed to instigate change and move the conversation forward.” “Film, TV, and video do so much to normalize sexual and reproductive health and erase the shame that often surrounds it. It’s one of our most important tools for educating people, especially young people,” she said.
Spruch and Johnson are confident in the approach because they’ve seen the gains around LGBTQ rights.
The HIV/AIDS epidemic in the 1980s spawned even more fear of gay people—men, especially. The Human Rights Council worked hard to help people who were discriminated against for their sexual orientation. But something more had to be done.
Slowly gay characters began to appear on television. Same-sex storylines cropped up like the one on Roseanne , which not only introduced a lesbian character but featured main character Roseanne Conner (Roseane Barr) kissing her. These small steps in individual stories and roles continued into the ’90s until the pivotal coming-out episode on Ellen , a sitcom starring comedian Ellen DeGeneres.
“[ Ellen ] brought into people’s homes someone [who families] can identify with, someone that they love, having an experience that they weren’t identified with,” Johnson said.
It would be years, decades, until same-sex marriage was legalized. However, that is part of the plan.
“You look at this model, and how the LBGTQ movement did this work with the entertainment industry and major corporations. That’s the work that Planned Parenthood is embarking on,” Johnson said.
“We’ve been around over a hundred years. People see us as the voice for reproductive health care, women’s health care, women’s rights more broadly. And we do see that there will be a shift in culture if we normalize people’s experiences.”
“As a filmmaker, I know how important it is to center storylines about LGBTQ characters and sexual and reproductive health in my work.” And not only normalize them, but also “humanize them,” she said.
Johnson said she is thankful for shows like Claws and Dear White People that have taken on these issues boldly and normally beyond abortion to include birth control, breast cancer, and consent. And shows Broad City , Shameless , and Orphan Black , and Netflix’s Big Mouth , which often discusses sexual topics targeted at younger audiences. Following a visit to a facility, creators Mark Levin and Jennifer Flackett included a Planned Parenthood-themed episode for the show’s second season.
Other creators have also been eager to get on board.
“I believe art is supposed to instigate change and move the conversation forward,” said Chinonye Chukwu, writer-director of the film Clemency , featuring Alfre Woodard and Danielle Brooks, which premiered at Sundance. Chukwu went on to suggest that there’s a need to center Black women in these stories around reproductive justice issues. “I’m interested in creating unique, engaging stories with Black women at the center [who] are navigating stories and arcs that are about more than just their race and gender.”
Filmmaker Dawn Porter echos Chukwu’s position.
“I’ve always been concerned with Black women and reproductive rights,” Porter said. “I’m also interested in voting rights and immigration—these issues are all intertwined. It was important to me to humanize the experience of Black women as well as low-income women seeking reproductive health care while filming Trapped . As a filmmaker, you’re the vehicle from which that truth emerges.”
Filmmaker Desiree Akhaven said she’s proud to stand with Planned Parenthood and appreciates the work they do “to ensure that people have the information and health care they need to stay healthy.”
“As a filmmaker, I know how important it is to center storylines about LGBTQ characters and sexual and reproductive health in my work,” Akhaven said. “These stories need to be told to help shift the conversation in this country and remove the stigma around these issues.” Akhaven said she encourages more filmmakers to join them.
But Johnson wants their joining to be more than symbolic.
“[I’m] not just asking someone to stand up for Planned Parenthood by wearing a pin, or making a statement on the red carpet, which is just as important. But really getting into the fabric of the culture. And that’s through [the storytelling content of] film and TV.”

Playing Whack-a-Mole With Broadband Industry Shills,www.commondreams.org,Tim Karr,04-02-2019,2019,4,http://www.commondreams.org/views/2019/04/02/playing-whack-mole-broadband-industry-shills,"This industry money has turned far too many decision-makers in Washington against the interests of the people they’re supposed to represent, people who support Net Neutrality in large numbers

Defending Net Neutrality in the media is like an endless game of Whack-a-Mole.
So many Op-Eds and letters to the editor that oppose the Save the Internet Act are written by people with financial ties to the broadband industry. And far too few of these ties are disclosed in the media.
Time to get the hammer!
The latest mole to emerge takes the form of a misleading letter to the editor in the New York Times . Its author is Ev Ehrlich, who’s affiliated with the ESC Company and the so-called Progressive Policy Institute. But you wouldn’t know that from reading his letter in the Times , as neither he nor the newspaper acknowledges these ties.
It’s a concerning oversight because both of these organizations have financial relationships with the phone and cable lobby, which is doing whatever it can to torpedo the Save the Internet Act.
In Ehrlich’s 2015 letter to the editor , the Times partially disclosed as much, noting in his bio that he “is president of ESC Company, an economics consulting firm that has telecom clients.”
But it doesn’t disclose his affiliation with the Progressive Policy Institute, which as part of the nonprofit Third Way Foundation has received five- and six-figure contributions from the major trade associations representing AT&T, Comcast, Verizon and other large firms.
And the misinformation doesn’t end at nondisclosure. In his new letter, Ehrlich claims that the Save the Internet Act isn’t bipartisan.
That all depends on your viewpoint.
It’s true that on Capitol Hill, only Democrats — so far — support the bill. But if you turn around and face the rest of the country, you’re seeing something entirely different.
Public polling shows overwhelming bipartisan support for the Save the Internet Act’s legal approach. A 2018 University of Maryland poll found that 86 percent of voters opposed the FCC’s repeal of the Title II Net Neutrality rules, including 82 percent of Republicans and 90 percent of Democrats.
If Republican members of Congress were genuinely interested in being bipartisan, they’d follow the good counsel of their constituents and support the Save the Internet Act.
At the moment, however, they and Ehrlich are looking the wrong way: toward the broadband industry and its checkbook and not the people of the United States.
Ehrlich also claims that a so-called “light touch approach” is to credit for the alleged “gusher” of investment and innovation across the sector. In this, he’s echoing much of the anti-Net Neutrality rhetoric emanating from the Trump FCC, and Chairman Ajit Pai in particular.
Ehrlich wants you to think that Net Neutrality rules have had the opposite effect — that they turned off the investment spigot. This is far from the truth, as we at Free Press Action have demonstrated time and again, and again, and again.
To cap it off, Ehrlich suggests that support for the Save the Internet Act is merely a ploy from advocates like Free Press Action — that we’re just trying to stir up hysteria and raise more money from our base.
That last doozy is a laugh when you compare the modest budget of an organization like ours to the hundreds of millions of dollars the phone and cable lobby spends on campaign contributions, lobbyists, lawyers, think tanks and PR firms.
This industry money has turned far too many decision-makers in Washington against the interests of the people they’re supposed to represent, people who support Net Neutrality in large numbers.
And it’s money that’s also found its way into Ehrlich’s bank account — inspiring today’s shady letter to the editor at the New York Times .

Hawks Clamoring to Attack Iran,911caper.com,HateLiars,04-02-2019,2019,4,http://911caper.com/2019/04/02/hawks-clamoring-to-attack-iran/,"Emile Nakhleh Lobelog.com
As Vice President Mike Pence, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, National Security Advisor John Bolton, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and Saudi crown prince and de facto ruler Mohammad bin Salman clamor for a war against Iran, they seem to have conveniently forgotten the destruction and mayhem wrought by the American invasion of Iraq 16 years ago.
These war drummers are underestimating the potential negative consequences of the war and overestimating the Iranian people’s dislike of their theocratic regime. They, like the advocates of the Iraqi invasion in the winter of 2002 and early spring 2003, are confusing Iranians’ dislike of the ayatollahs with their potential embrace of a foreign invader.
On the eve of the Iraq war, former President George W. Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice, Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz, the Vice President Chief of Staff and Assistant to the President David Addington all claimed that the Iraqi invasion aimed at liberating the country from the brutal regime of Saddam Hussein. Removing Saddam from power, they maintained, would eliminate the threat of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and bring stability, security, and democracy to Iraq.
As developments unfolded over the past 16 years, the “liberation” claims proved to be bogus. The invasion and the decision to de-Ba’athify Iraq and dissolve the Iraqi military created an environment conducive to sectarianism, insurgency, and terrorism. The vacuum that followed the regime collapse, the incompetence of the American administration in the “Green Zone,” and the pervasive corruption of the new Iraqi governing councils was quickly filled by pro-Iranian militias, al-Qaeda, and later the Islamic State. The promise of stability and security was replaced by chaos, bloodshed, and mayhem.
The massive destruction of Iraq and the horrendous human and material cost the American “liberation” caused for the country will be child’s play compared to what could happen if Trump and his Israeli and Saudi allies decide to attack Iran. Unlike Iraq—which the British cobbled together after World War One out of the Shia, Sunnis, and Kurds under a minority Sunni rule— Iran has been in existence for centuries with a vast territory and a huge population. If attacked, Iran has the capability to retaliate against its neighbors, especially Saudi Arabia. Its air and missile forces could quickly destroy the oil and gas facilities and the water and power grids on the Arab side of the Gulf. A war against Iran could easily spread to the Gulf and the Levant. The entire region could go up in flames."

Get ready for the anti-Trump “resistance” to go truly loco, because new polling data indicates Hispanic support for the president is swelling, a trend that could seal his 2020 re-election victory.
When I helped lead the Trump Hispanic Advisory Council in 2016, our effort was widely derided by skeptics certain that the narrative of Trump as anti-Latino would doom his candidacy, particularly in heavily Hispanic states like Florida. But that November, Hispanics saw through the media smears and Trump massively outperformed dour expectations, actually surpassing Mitt Romney’s 2012 percentage among Latino voters.
Since then, prospects have only improved – most importantly for the overall well-being of America’s Hispanic citizens, but also for the political prognosis of President Trump. So much good news erupted last week for the president with the conclusion of the Mueller inquiry that stunning new polling data was largely glossed over. McLaughlin & Associates revealed that Hispanic approval for Trump in March jumped to 50%. This number matched the January Marist/NPR/PBS survey that shocked cynics with its own 50% approval finding. Even if those polls are too aggressive, February’s Morning Consult/Politico poll showed Trump’s Hispanic approval vaulting to a still-impressive 45%.
What explains this stunning trend? I see three key factors:
The Economy – Hispanics neither desire nor expect a laundry list of deliverables from government, but rather seek the conditions to advance and prosper independently. As the most statistically entrepreneurial demographic in America, Hispanics have thrived amid the Trump boom as regulatory and tax relief unleashes a small business surge. Every American benefits from this new dynamism, but Hispanics most of all. For example, the Hispanic jobless rate has now been below 5% for the last 11 months; prior to the Trump presidency, it had only been below 5% for one month ever (in 2006). In addition, jobs are paying more. Wage growth has finally ramped higher for all Americans, but especially for Hispanics, who now welcome wage growth far above workers on the whole. The American manufacturing renaissance drives much of this resurgence, as on-shoring, better trade deals, and rising optimism made 2018 the best year for factory jobs since the 1990s.
Immigration – Leftist politicians and their media allies wrongly assume that Hispanics espouse softness on immigration illegality. In reality, a 2018 YouGov/Economist poll detailed that only 20% of Hispanics support the practice of “catch and release” of families crossing our border illegally. Indeed, Hispanic Americans often suffer the worst, most immediate consequences of porous borders. Too often, Hispanic workers must compete against unfair, illegal labor. In addition, dangerous illegal aliens largely terrorize Hispanic citizens. The tragic tales of MS-13 savagery, for example, normally involve Hispanic victims like Carlos Rivas-Majano, one of 27 people killed by the gang on Long Island, N.Y., in just the past three years . While elites like wannabe-Hispanic Robert Francis O’Rourke pontificate about open borders and tearing down existing border walls, the actual on-the-ground consequences flow to people with names like Hernandez, Cabrera, and Cortes. Hispanic Americans have suffered too many totally preventable losses, such as slain Arizona police Sgt. Brandon Mendoza and young Los Angeles mother Sandra Duran, both murdered by illegal aliens living in America despite multiple prior arrests in the United States.
Social Issues – As the Democratic Party lurches left on social issues, the largely Catholic and Evangelical Hispanic community of America finds itself orphaned by the Democratic Party. Increasingly, Democrat lawmakers and leaders support abortion up until the very day of birth (and even beyond), so Hispanics naturally gravitate to pro-life Trump. A 2018 Pew poll , for instance, found that 61% of whites believe abortion should be legal in most/all circumstances, but only 44% of Hispanics concur. In a separate survey , Pew also discovered that among Democrats, Hispanics are almost twice as likely to identify as “conservative” as non-Hispanics. Given these realities, the increasingly extremist Democratic Party practically invites electoral doom in 2020.
Looking state-by-state at the 2020 presidential race, the groundswell of Trump’s Hispanic popularity solidifies the president’s re-election prospects. A Trump gain to 40% of the Hispanic vote -- a very realistic goal at this point – could effectively seal repeat wins in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, and Arizona. Winning those states means the Democratic nominee must clean-sweep the 2016 Trump states of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin. Moreover, even that upper Midwest sweep would not be enough if Trump’s ascent with Hispanics puts in play Nevada and Colorado, states with large Latino populations that Clinton won by low single digits last election.
For decades, Republicans have chased the “holy grail” of votes from Hispanics, a group that naturally should align with the conservative principles of entrepreneurial capitalism, strong borders, and a culture of life. Paradoxically, the man whom the mainstream media most attempted to vilify as anti-Latino will, at last, truly welcome Hispanics to their rightful political home.

Opposition Activist Files Suit against Russia before European Court of Human Rights | Russian Insight,robertamsterdam.com,,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://robertamsterdam.com/opposition-activist-files-suit-against-russia-before-european-court-of-human-rights/,"By Robert Amsterdam | Published: April 3, 2019
The following press release was distributed to international media on 3 April 2019.
LONDON, 3 April 2019 – Vladimir Bessonov, a former member of the Russian State Duma and prominent opposition activist, has filed a complaint before the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) to denounce a politically motivated judicial process aimed at violating his rights and further suppressing political dissent in Russia, according to the law firm of Amsterdam & Partners LLP.
Bessonov has been the subject of a selective criminal investigation by the Russian government which has culminated in his being sentenced at trial, in absentia, to three years imprisonment for allegedly committing acts of violence against two representatives of the state.
According to Robert Amsterdam, international counsel to Bessonov, Russia’s case against the former parliamentarian is categorically baseless and fits within a broadly acknowledged trend of the Kremlin abusing the justice system to silence political opponents with trumped up charges. This unlawful conduct by the Russian Federation, says Amsterdam, violates the country’s commitments under the European Convention on Human Rights.
“The prosecution’s treatment of Bessonov is outrageous, and yet another hallmark of a system of ‘dual-state justice,’ where one set of courts deals with normal law enforcement while another settles political scores,” said Amsterdam. “Sadly, our client joins the ever-extending lists of Russian political activists such as Alexey Navalny and Lev Ponomarev among many others whose rights have been repeatedly violated. We are optimistic that Strasbourg will see the reality of Russia’s established machinery of repression that crushes any dissent.”
According to Amsterdam & Partners LLP, Bessonov has been targeted as a result of a public meeting of opposition representatives that took place in 2011. Despite the meeting being conducted in an entirely peaceful manner which caused no obstruction to the public, police officers forcefully interrupted and dispersed the meeting of the opposition representatives in an aggressive and illegal manner.
In the wake of this oppressive police conduct, a criminal investigation was launched against Bessonov, pertaining to his alleged use of force against two police officers during the armed interruption of the meeting. This investigation was used as a politically motivated weapon to strip Bessonov of his political immunity.
The complaint being filed before ECtHR by Dmitry Agranovsky, a Russian human rights lawyer and co-counsel with Amsterdam, argues that violations occurred with regard to his right to a fair trial (Article 6), his right to freedom of expression (Article 10), his right to freedom of assembly and association (Article 11) and for breach of the limitations imposed by the convention on restrictions of rights (Article 18). Bessonov’s conviction has been condemned both domestically in Russia and internationally, including statements made by members of the European Parliament and the International Meeting of Communist and Workers’ Parties.
Bessonov was not notified of the course of his trial, nor was he able to actively take part in proceedings. Hearings were strategically scheduled while Bessonov was fulfilling his duty as a member of the State Duma by participating in meetings. As a result of his absence, Bessonov was first sentenced to house arrest, then to custody. Despite numerous appeals where evidence of Bessonov’s participation in State Duma meetings was presented, this decision was upheld.
At trial, the only evidence presented against Bessonov was given by the two officers who allege to have been assaulted him. To the contrary, over fifty witnesses testified at trial that Bessonov did not assault police officers in any way. These testimonies were unduly dismissed by the court as being too similar to each other, with the prosecution alleging that they were made at the request of Bessonov’s defence counsel for the benefit of his trial.
Defence counsel also provided the court with a report made by a video expert, who analysed the video footage of the confrontation and confirmed that Bessonov did not assault the officers, or anyone else during the conflict. Moreover, a medical expert testified that the two officers did not, and could not, have suffered head traumas on the day of the meeting. Despite this, Bessonov was convicted and sentenced by the court for committing acts of violence against two representatives of power.
Amsterdam says that Bessonov’s counsel will explore every available avenue to defend his rights against this illegal attack by the Russian government. More information about the case is available at robertamsterdam.com.

But letting taxpayers keep more of the money we earn?
That’s too complicated to do this year, the Colorado Sun reports, noting it was the GOP who actually tried to get one passed.
Earlier this year, a state Senate committee rejected an even smaller 3 percent reduction in the income tax rate proposed by Republican lawmakers.
It’s the Democratic state lawmakers and Polis’s own supporters who don’t want the tax cut interfering with their spending habits and $32.3 billion budget for next year.

Only they’re not going to call it a tax because of that pesky TABOR thingamabob they can’t make go away.
Instead, Democrats are going to call it a fee, and they’re going to attach it to all of our paychecks and force businesses to come up with more money to pay for more free stuff for the few!
This time, the free stuff is an all-paid, family medical leave act for those few colleagues that require it for three months due to an emergency.
Never mind that many companies already offer paid leave, Democrats want to create a state insurance fund operating with a bigger cut taken from our income taxes, reports the Pueblo Chieftain.
We’ve had several friends who would have benefited from paid family leave, we’re not disputing the need in some cases.
But taxing everyone in the state of the Colorado for the needs of a few is never the answer.
We would urge the legislature to carefully debate this measure and find a fairer solution to the problem that does not tax everyone.
Sadly, careful deliberation is completely lost on our new Democratic-controlled state government.

The price for Hass avocados from Michoacán, Mexico's main avocado producing region, increased 34 percent on Tuesday amid President Trump
That was the biggest one-day increase since 2009, according to the news outlet, which noted that 75 to 80 percent of avocados consumed in the U.S. come from Mexico. ADVERTISEMENT
If Trump were to close the border, the U.S. would face a severe shortage of the fruit.
Separately, the head of the world's largest avocado distributer told Reuters that the U.S. would run out of avocados in three weeks if the border was shut down.
Trump threatened to close the border on Friday unless Mexico stopped all illegal immigration to the U.S.
""If Mexico doesn’t immediately stop ALL illegal immigration coming into the United States throug [sic] our Southern Border, I will be CLOSING "" he tweeted. ""....the Border, or large sections of the Border, next week."" ....through their country and our Southern Border.

This would be so easy for Mexico to do, but they just take our money and “talk.” Besides, we lose so much money with them, especially when you add in drug trafficking etc.), that the Border closing would be a good thing!
Trump has since shifted on the issue, saying instead that he would only close down the border if he could not reach a stricter immigration agreement with Congress .
“I haven’t made that intention known. And I’m ready to close it if I have to close it,” he told reporters Tuesday. "

Derrick Johnson, President and CEO of the NAACP, made the following statement in response to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s reckless move to shorten the Senate’s consideration for district court nominees and certain executive nominees.
“The NAACP strongly condemns Senate Majority Leader McConnell’s approach for breaking the rules once again to harm our justice system.
“This power grab should fail. Contrary to what Sen. McConnell says, these are not “lower tier nominees.” District court judges serve for a lifetime. These are trial judges who make consequential decisions about claims, parties, juries, evidence, and in criminal cases, sentencing. They will be ruling on our rights for a generation or more.
“Trump’s judicial nominees warrant more Senate scrutiny, not less. They are overwhelmingly white and male, with extreme ideologies. Their records of hostility to civil rights are disqualifying, but confirmations at breakneck speed will conceal critical facts. Thomas Farr’s nomination to a North Carolina court was defeated because of information revealed in the eleventh hour that he personally engaged in voter suppression.
“If Sen. McConnell prevails, dozens of Trump’s nominees could be confirmed almost overnight. By jamming through this rule change, the GOP could increase the number of Trump judges by over 40% in a couple of weeks. This is unacceptable.
“The NAACP is fighting to keep our courts fair, independent, and diverse. We urge everyone to join this battle to #SaveOurCourts.” "

How the U.S. Creates Sh*thole Countries: A Review,www.informationclearinghouse.info,informationclearinghouse.info,04-02-2019,2019,4,http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/51370.htm,"By Danny Haiphong
Cynthia McKinney and her co-writers have produced an important literary tool for anti-imperial agitation and education.
Trumps use of sh*thole offered an opportunity to explain the realities of U.S. foreign policy to the people.
April 02, 2019 "" House "" - Cynthia McKinney has been on the frontlines of the struggle for global peace for decades. Known first as a dissenting voice in Congress and then for her work in exposing the truth about the U.S.-led wars on the Palestinian, Libyan, and Black people here in the United States, McKinneys voice is seldom heard in the arena of corporate politics. She has long understood that one of the most critical tasks of this historical juncture is the mobilization of the masses to stop the endless wars waged by U.S. Empire. In a series of essays written by activists, scholars, and analysts from across the political spectrum, McKinney shows through practice what this should look like. Her new book How the U.S. Creates Sh*thole Countries is an invaluable piece of literature that seeks to transform anti-war ideas into an anti-war movement.
The book challenges the liberal ethos that Trumps vulgar sh*thole comments in January of 2018 were some aberration or detached from reality. Liberal elites work hard to erase the realities of racism and war by claiming the moral high ground of respectability politics. Their criticisms of Trump center around his foul language to distract from the role that they play in the creation of sh*thole countries. McKinney and the rest of the authors condemn Trump for characterizing Haiti and African nations such as Nigeria as sh*tholes while attempting to answer a question that neither racist demagogues nor liberal elites dare to ask: What exactly causes the massive suffering experienced around the world?

CNN And WaPo Demand That Trump Further Escalate Tensions With Russia,www.informationclearinghouse.info,informationclearinghouse.info,04-02-2019,2019,4,http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/51369.htm,"April 02, 2019 "" House "" - CNN has aired a segment in which pundit Fareed Zakaria tells the networks audience that the US president has been unwilling to confront Putin in any way on any issue and asks will Venezuela be the moment when Trump finally ends his appeasement? The segment is a near-verbatim reading of Zakarias Washington Post column from a couple of days prior, so thats two massive prongs through which this false and pernicious narrative is being driven into mainstream consciousness claiming that the Trump administration has been far too dovish toward Moscow, rather than dangerously hawkish as is actually the case .
Zakaria begins his segment by describing the Trump administrations ( completely illegitimate ) efforts to oust Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, then describing Russian efforts to counter this agenda as an attempt to taunt the United States. He then spends the rest of the segment asking if Trump will be brave and patriotic enough to further escalate tensions against a nuclear superpower. Zakaria concludes by implying that if Trump fails to increase world-threatening nuclear tensions to effect yet another US regime change intervention in yet another oil-rich country, it will be because he is a Kremlin agent.

Joe Biden's 2020 Ukrainian nightmare: A closed probe is revived,www.informationclearinghouse.info,informationclearinghouse.info,04-02-2019,2019,4,http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/51376.htm,"Joe Biden's 2020 Ukrainian nightmare: A closed probe is revived By John Solomon
April 02, 2019 "" House "" - Two years after leaving office, Joe Biden couldnt resist the temptation last year to brag to an audience of foreign policy specialists about the time as vice president that he strong-armed Ukraine into firing its top prosecutor.
In his own words, with video cameras rolling, Biden described how he threatened Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko in March 2016 that the Obama administration would pull $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees, sending the former Soviet republic toward insolvency, if it didnt immediately fire Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin.
I said, Youre not getting the billion. Im going to be leaving here in, I think it was about six hours. I looked at them and said: Im leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, youre not getting the money, Biden recalled telling Poroshenko.
Well, son of a bitch, he got fired. And they put in place someone who was solid at the time, Biden told the Council on Foreign Relations event, insisting that President Obama was in on the threat.
Interviews with a half-dozen senior Ukrainian officials confirm Bidens account, though they claim the pressure was applied over several months in late 2015 and early 2016, not just six hours of one dramatic day. Whatever the case, Poroshenko and Ukraines parliament obliged by ending Shokins tenure as prosecutor. Shokin was facing steep criticism in Ukraine, and among some U.S. officials, for not bringing enough corruption prosecutions when he was fired.
But Ukrainian officials tell me there was one crucial piece of information that Biden must have known but didnt mention to his audience: The prosecutor he got fired was leading a wide-ranging corruption probe into the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings that employed Bidens younger son, Hunter, as a board member.
U.S. banking records show Hunter Bidens American-based firm, Rosemont Seneca Partners LLC, received regular transfers into one of its accounts  usually more than $166,000 a month  from Burisma from spring 2014 through fall 2015, during a period when Vice President Biden was the main U.S. official dealing with Ukraine and its tense relations with Russia.

Suspect Named in Nipsey Hussle Slaying,aurn.com,Tanya Hart,04-03-2019,2019,4,http://aurn.com/suspect-named-in-nipsey-hussle-slaying/,"Nipsey Hussle arrives at the Roc Nation Pre-Grammy Brunch at RocNation Offices on Saturday, Feb. 7, 2015, in Beverly Hills, Calif. (Photo by Rob Latour/Invision/AP)
A suspect has been named in the murder of Nipsey Hussle.
Nipsey Hussle’s murder happened in view of a nearby surveillance camera — and the footage could give police a lead in their search for the trigger man. TMZ obtained footage from a business adjacent to Nipsey’s The Marathon Clothing store. On the left side of the screen you can see someone in a red shirt enter the frame from an alleyway, walking quickly toward the front of the store. A longer version of the surveillance video shows the shooter, a man in a dark shirt, opening fire 3 separate times on Nipsey Hussle. He shoots Nipsey once starts walking away then comes back a second time and shoots again, and then a third time. After the third time, he kicks Nipsey and flees back toward the alley … where we initially saw him enter the video. Multiple sources tell us before the shooter unloaded, he had a tense convo with Nipsey. We’re told Nipsey asked him if he had snitched to cops in the past because that was the word on the street. We’re told the suspect felt disrespected, left to get a gun then returned to get revenge.

"In 1999, it was Yugoslavia in the crosshairs of the imperialists, now its Venezuela",www.informationclearinghouse.info,informationclearinghouse.info,04-02-2019,2019,4,http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/51372.htm,"By Neil Clark
April 02, 2019 "" House "" - To mark the 20th anniversary of the start of NATOs illegal 78-day bombardment of Yugoslavia, over 200 distinguished guests from all over the world gathered for a conference of the Belgrade Forum of the World of Equals. The gathering titled  Never to Forget: Peace and Progress instead of Wars and Poverty  promoted genuine internationalism. Participants came from Israel AND Palestine. From Iran and Japan. From Britain, Germany, Italy, France and other NATO countries which had taken part in the bombing. From Venezuela, Cuba, Bulgaria, Greece, Brazil, Croatia, Canada and South Africa. India and Nepal, Austria and Switzerland, Ireland, Portugal, Turkey and Lebanon. From the US AND Russia. This was the real international community on display. Speaker after speaker denounced NATOs unlawful aggression, and stressed the wider significance of the military action of 20 years ago, which not only lacked a mandate from the United Nations Security Council, but was also in breach of NATOs own charter.
Eva-Maria Follmer-Mueller, president of the Mut zur Ethik Association in Switzerland, described it as  a historic turning point .
Momir Bulatovic, the prime minister of Yugoslavia in March 1999, called the bombing  a crime which only grows in significance . He pointed out that it was the first step in a still ongoing war against other countries. He and subsequent speakers, (myself included), noted that since 1999 weve had US-led attacks on a series of independently-minded, strategically important and resource-rich sovereign states, including Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya and Syria, while others, such as Iran and Venezuela have been subject to intense economic warfare. Each time were encouraged to see these conflicts as stand-alones with the leader of the target state demonized, usually as the New Hitler, and someone who must be stopped, but actually they are all part of the same war. A war for empire and the global hegemony of the US and rapacious international finance capital.

A young Jewish couple just set up the first permanent Chabad House in Kyoto, Japan. Rabbi Dovid and Chaya Mushka Posner, and their infant son Menachem Mendel, founded the home in a city with 17 UNESCO World Heritage Sites that were largely spared bombardment during World War II, world-class universities, and the headquarters of Nintendo and many other tech companies, reported Chabad.org. Kyoto attracts many Jewish visitors from Israel, the United States, Europe and elsewhere. Rabbi Posner, 25, is originally from southern California. His wife grew up in Caracas, Venezuela. Both Posners come from lines of emissaries. Chabd.org explained the following: Chaya Mushka Posner’s parents are longtime emissaries in Venezuela. Rabbi Posner is a fourth-generation emissary. His great-grandparents, Rabbi Sholom and Chaya Posner, built much of the infrastructure for Jewish life in Pittsburgh. His one set of grandparents, Rabbi Zalman I. and Risya Posner, served as lifelong emissaries to Nashville, Tenn., and the other set, Rabbi Shmuel and Hindy Lew, have been stationed in London since 1964. His parents, Shimon and Y. Chaya Posner, co-direct a Chabad center in Rancho Mirage, Calif. The couple landed just before Purim and does not know Japanese. They are using several apps to try to learn the language. One of the biggest challenges in Kyoto is obtaining kosher meat. They had to bring their own kosher slaughterer into the city. They put on a Purim feast last month. This month, they will host a Passover Seder.

PARIS (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 03rd April, 2019) French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian commenting on the resignation of the Algerian president Abdelaziz Bouteflika expressed confidence that the Algerian people will continue the democratic transition in a spirit of calm and responsibility.
On Tuesday, Bouteflika, 82 submitted his resignation, with the Constitutional Council now due to meet and discuss Bouteflika's petition to resign.
""President Bouteflika has announced his resignation. This important page in the history of Algeria has been turned. In recent weeks, Algerian people, through continuous decent and peaceful mobilization, have shown determination to do everything to have their voices heard. We are confident that all Algerians are capable to continue this democratic transition in the same spirit of calm and responsibility,"" Le Drian said in a statement.
Algeria has been experiencing a wave of anti-government protests, triggered by Bouteflika's plans to seek a fifth term in the office, since late February . On March 11, Bouteflika, who served as the country's president for 20 years, withdrew his bid for re-election and postponed the vote , initially scheduled for April 18. However, protests have continued, with people demanding immediate changes.
Former president of Algeria Liamine Zeroual said on Tuesday that he had received an offer to head the transitional period in Algeria after the resignation of Bouteflika."

Wellington, April 3 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 3rd Apr, 2019 ) : New Zealand opted for experience in a 15-man squad named Wednesday for this year's cricket World Cup, with rookie Tom Blundell's inclusion as back-up wicketkeeper the only real surprise.
The Blacks Caps hope to shed their tag as valiant losers and claim the title after exiting in the semi-finals six times and suffering a heavy defeat to Australia in their only appearance in the final four years ago.
Coach Gary Stead said the Kane Williamson-led Black Caps had repeatedly proved itself at the top level and he was confident the consistency would shine through at the tournament in England and Wales .
""We've got a squad here of 15 players that we think can give us a really, really good chance of going far into the tournament,"" he said.
""If we play close to our potential, then hopefully we can do New Zealand proud."" Wellington keeper Blundell was selected after Tim Siefert, the regular back-up to first-choice gloveman Tom Latham, broke his finger in a domestic match last month.
While Blundell, who has two Test caps, will likely make his one-day international debut at the tournament, his role will be marginal if Latham stays fit.
Mitchell Santner will be the New Zealander's Primary spinner, with Ish Sodhi edging Todd Astle to claim the second slow bowling position.
The pace attack comprises Tim Southee, Trent Boult, Lockie Ferguson and Matt Henry, while Jimmy Neesham and Colin de Grandhomme add allround options.
Henry Nicholls is set to open the batting with veteran Martin Guptill after displacing Colin Munro at the top of the order, although Munro will make the trip as batting cover.
Williamson and Ross Taylor, in his fourth World Cup campaign, complete a battle-hardened batting line up.
Williamson, Taylor and Guptill have collectively amassed 526 ODI appearances between them.
Guptill and Taylor have not confirmed their post-tournament plans but will most likely be looking to exit cricket 's biggest stage on a high.
The Black Caps will open their campaign against Sri Lanka in Cardiff on June 1.

Ottawa, April 3 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 3rd Apr, 2019 ) :Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau ousted from his Liberal Party on Tuesday two former ministers whose accusations of political meddling in a prosecution jeopardized his re-election bid.
The announcement came at the end of an emergency caucus meeting to consider expelling former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould after her release of a secret recording last week that reignited the simmering scandal .
Former budget minister Jane Philpott, who had quit in protest over Trudeau 's handling of the controversy, was also removed.
""Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott will no longer be members of the Liberal caucus,"" Trudeau said.
""The trust that previously existed between these two individuals and our team has been broken,"" he said.
""Whether it's taping conversations without consent or repeatedly expressing a lack of confidence in our government and in me personally as leader, it's become clear that (both) can no longer remain part of our Liberal team."" Since February , Trudeau 's government has been rocked by accusations that his inner circle sought to shield engineering giant SNC-Lavalin from a corruption trial.
The Montreal-based firm was charged in 2015 for allegedly paying bribes to secure contracts in Libya .
Wilson-Raybould refused to ask prosecutors to settle the case, and the trial is set to proceed.
After resigning, she testified to lawmakers that she'd experienced ""consistent and sustained"" political pressure to interfere in the case, including ""veiled threats."" Trudeau has steadfastly denied the claims, which also led to the resignations of two other senior officials, and plunged his Liberals behind the opposition Tories in opinion polls just months before elections.
On Friday, the House of Commons justice committee looking into the allegations released messages and a secret recording by Wilson-Raybould of a call with Canada 's top bureaucrat, Chief of the Privy Council Michael Wernick, to back her claims.
""If a politician secretly records a conversation with anyone,"" Trudeau said, ""it's wrong."" He labeled as ""unconscionable"" the one-time attorney general's secret recording of the clerk of the Privy Council.
The prime minister said the scandal has sidelined his government 's progressive agenda and created divisions within the party.
""Our political opponents win when the Liberals are divided,"" he said. ""We can't afford to make that mistake, Canadians are counting on us.""Earlier in the day, Wilson-Raybould had expressed her desire to remain in the party and run as a Liberal in the October election .

US agriculture department closes 'kitten slaughterhouse',www.urdupoint.com,,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.urdupoint.com/en/miscellaneous/us-agriculture-department-closes-kitten-slau-584225.html,"US Agriculture Department Closes 'kitten Slaughterhouse' Muhammad Irfan 5 08:05 AM
Washington, April 2 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 3rd Apr, 2019 ) :The US Department of Agriculture on Tuesday announced it would no longer use cats in research that, according to a watchdog group, involved forced ""cannibalism"" and resulted in over 3,000 of the animals being put down since 1982.
Over more than three decades, in a laboratory in Beltsville, near the capital Washington , scientists fed cats and kittens meat possibly contaminated with the parasite toxoplasma gondii, according to the White Coat Waste Project (WCW).
The researchers then tested the cats' stools to confirm the presence of toxoplasma in the meat. After three weeks, they went on to euthanize the cats even though they were healthy.
At least 3,000 cats and kittens were used since 1982, according to WCW, which unveiled the ""kitten slaughterhouse"" in 2018 .
For a decade -- ending in 2015 -- the department also bought hundreds of deceased cats and dogs in China , Vietnam , Ethiopia , Colombia and other countries to feed their cats and other animals, the group said.
Following the WCW 2018 investigation, lawmakers introduced bills to end the project.
Under pressure, USDA said that ""the use of cats as part of any research protocol in any ARS (Agricultural Research Service) laboratory has been discontinued and will not be reinstated."" ""This is a major victory for kittens, cats, and taxpayers,"" said Nevada Congresswoman Dina Titus.
The 14 remaining cats will be adopted by officials at the department, which pointed out the research has contributed to halving the rate of people infected with the parasite, which is dangerous for pregnant women and can be deadly.
""We are absolutely thrilled that kittens are out of harm's way,"" said Justin Goodman, vice-president of the Waste Coat Waste Project, which works to protects the thousands of cats and dogs used in private and university labs across the US.
The group previously spearheaded a successful campaign to stop the Department of Veterans' Affairs carrying out research on puppies and dogs."

""To date , we have not received the information about closures of US border crossings,"" Ebrard told reporters.
The minister added that slowdowns of commercial traffic have been registered at several crossings, including in Ciudad Juarez , according to Once broadcaster.
Trump himself previously admitted that closing the border would have a negative effect on the US economy.
On Monday, Mexican Interior Secretary Olga Sanchez Cordero said the Mexican government does not plan to adopt a special plan to restrain caravans of migrants from Central America that travel through the country to the United States . She added that the government of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador does not intend to militarize the country's southern border in an attempt to deter Central American migrants.
According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Mexico , only in February , more than 76,000 migrants, who crossed Mexico and tried to get into the United States were detained, and in March this figure is expected to amount to 100,000 people."

WADA Announces Release of Antidoping Textbook in Russian,www.urdupoint.com,,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.urdupoint.com/en/world/wada-announces-release-of-antidoping-textbook-584223.html,"WADA Announces Release Of Antidoping Textbook In Russian Zeeshan Aziz (@imziishan) 21 07:25 AM
MOSCOW (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 03rd April, 2019) The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) has released an antidoping textbook in Russian for professional athletes and students.
""WADA's University #AntiDoping Textbook is now available in Russian!"" WADA said on Twitter .
According to WADA, the textbook is targeted to elite and student-athletes that may one day be involved in sport and provides a comprehensive overview of doping in sport.
In 2015 , WADA accused Russia of multiple violations of anti-doping regulations, which eventually led to sanctions against Russian athletes, including stripping some of them of their 2016 Summer Olympics medals and imposing restrictions on the Russian national team ahead of the 2018 Winter Olympics .
Russian officials have categorically denied the very possibility of the existence of a state-run doping program in the country, but have admitted there were some isolated cases of doping abuse.
On September 20, the great majority of the WADA Executive Committee voted to reinstate the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) as an organization that complies with the World Anti-Doping Code."

Friday, a Miami court docket convicted Ali Nasreeddine Kassir, a Miami-based Lebanese businessman and alleged Hezbollah facilitator, who pleaded responsible to passport fraud and conspiracy to commit cash laundering of greater than $ 70 million in whole. Kassir & # 39; s conviction is the opening volley in a collection of interconnected instances involving alleged Hezbollah financiers Nader Mohamad Farhat and Mahmoud Ali Barakat and their US-based enterprise counterparts. Combined, these instances contain cash transfers price a whole lot of thousands and thousands of {dollars} by the US monetary system, allegedly for laundering prison proceeds, together with drug trafficking and terrorist financing.
In response to this clear risk to the integrity of the US monetary system, the administration has begun to enhance its strain in opposition to Hezbollah's abroad networks, however South American governments have to supply way more cooperation for Washington's makes an attempt to succeed.
Both Farhat and Barakat come from Ciudad Del Este, the Paraguayan metropolis in the Tri-Border Area of ​​Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay, or TBA. A latest Miami Herald analysis piece, known as Ciudad Del Este, ""a giant washing machine for Latin American drug profits, overthrowing consumer goods and raising money for terrorists."" Hundreds of tons of economic items use customs on a month-to-month foundation, normally from Miami on industrial cargo flights.
Last 12 months the Ministry of Justice rightly known as Hezbollah a transnational prison group. Since January 2017, the international ministries and the state have collectively imposed dozens of sanctions in opposition to Hezbollah's abroad networks. But to be sure that these actions – from investigations to sanctions – have their most impression, the US is determined by the cooperation of regional allies to block cash and possessions earlier than Hezbollah's financiers can take them out of their attain. Local governments have been sluggish to act in opposition to Hezbollah networks, generally even decided to deny their existence.
Given the dangers of native passivity and, sometimes, even obstruction, the Trump administration should calibrate its technique to embrace quite a few instruments that concurrently exert most strain on each Hezbollah networks and their corrupt enablers .
Firstly, the US should persuade its regional allies to take tangible measures to meet the problem.
None of the three TBA governments has designated Hezbollah as a terrorist group. While Argentina has taken necessary steps in this route, Brazil and Paraguay, the two nations the place Hezbollah's monetary networks are most energetic, are lagging behind. Such laws is essential and President TrumpDonald John TrumpTrump slashes Puerto Rico after catastrophe aid invoice Stalls Kushner appeals to safety clause after whistleblower raises issues Trump predicts new well being care legislation after 2020 MORE should use its status to encourage its counterparts to take this step.
The latest, profitable go to of Jair Bolsonaro, the new president of Brazil to Washington, has laid the basis for a fruitful private relationship between the two leaders. Trump enjoys comparable heat relationships with Argentine President Mauricio Macri, and he should use these private relationships to power Brasilia and Buenos Aires to take motion.
Brazil, Paraguay and Argentina additionally want new laws to enhance the investigation and prevention measures of intelligence and legislation enforcement companies. Once in place, this legislative framework would allow these governments to impose sanctions and conduct investigations along with the United States. Joint denominations would ship a robust sign to the international monetary system and the freezing of belongings associated to the designated events can be extra intensive and efficient.
The TBA governments should additionally work to restrict the injury brought on by leaks, or worse, the energetic obstructionism of corrupt officers. Therefore, the United States should be ready to act independently when associate governments refuse to cooperate or when their actions are undermined by corrupt native officers.
US prison investigations, prosecutions and profitable prosecutions should be continued wherever doable, with extra assets allotted to related authorities companies to enhance the variety of prosecuted instances and enhance the variety of profitable convictions.
This is important as a result of in the TBA massive investigations into alleged cash laundering practices with doable terrorist financing hyperlinks usually do not go to court docket. Last November, Paraguayan newspaper ABC Color tied Hezbollah to the 2016 "" megalavado ""("" Mega-wash "") investigation, in which one among the largest cash laundering methods in Paraguay's historical past was found. It stays to be seen whether or not the alleged settlement benefited the terror group. In any case, the US Department of Foreign Affairs has marked the case as an indication of Paraguay's failure to battle cash laundering.
It is greater than two years in the past that the Paraguayan authorities dedicated raids in opposition to the suspected perpetrators. The prosecutors in cost of the case have been changed a number of occasions – together with, most lately, throughout the final Christmas vacation. There have been neither costs nor exonerations.
Finally, the United States should use present sanctions laws, not solely to disrupt Hezbollah's abroad networks, but additionally to goal those that facilitate Hezbollah's networks by complicity, collusion, corruption and safety. In October 2018, President Trump signed the legislation on amendments to the worldwide Hezbollah financing legislation to stop warfare measures. This laws strengthened earlier efforts by the US Congress to broaden the attain of US monetary sanctions in opposition to Hezbollah by the unique Hezbollah International Financing Prevention Act. Combined, this legislative framework presents a dual-track risk to the corrupt Hezbollah enablers in the TBA.
First, the laws imposes secondary sanctions, not solely on well-known Hezbollah entities, but additionally on these & # 39; which might be decided by the president to commit to fundraising or recruitment actions for Hezbollah. & # 39; Although these actions are already prohibited by the US Sanctions Act, the secondary sanctions require the administration to impose ""any foreign person who determines the President knowingly and significantly knowingly providing financial, material or technological support to or for"" Hezbollah fundraisers. This may be any Paraguayan, Brazilian or Argentinian particular person or firm that rents services to, presents banking companies, receives bribes from, or takes every other motion that helps an individual designated for fundraising or recruitment.
Secondly, the laws permits for the utility of stricter due diligence measures to US banks in respect of jurisdictions aside from Lebanon – at federal, state or municipal stage – that ""explicitly consent to, or allow knowledge of, the use of their territory by Hezbollah to carry out terrorist activities, including training, financing and recruitment. ""This signifies that if native politicians and bureaucrats in the TBA know and ignore Hezbollah & # 39; s fundraising and recruitment in areas that they handle, the administration may management the space itself topic to extra monetary management.
The administration has the choice of utilizing diplomacy, legislation enforcement actions and sanctions to broaden the battle in opposition to Hezbollah's actions in the TBA and Latin America. This won’t solely restrict Hezbollah's operational capabilities, however may also defend the US monetary system in opposition to the drug good points and fund-raising of terrorists that permeates that area.

SEREMBAN: Umno’s Mohamad Hasan has questioned the likelihood of Dr Mahathir Mohamad handing over the reins to Anwar Ibrahim in two years’ time as promised, saying the PKR president will likely remain “the longest prime minister-in-waiting”.
“I know our ‘atok’ very well,” he said, referring to the 93-year-old statesman. “He will not give Anwar the post.
“Our ‘atok’ is hard-hearted. Those who dream of (Anwar) becoming prime minister will be disappointed,” he added.
Speaking at a ceramah for the Rantau by-election here, Mohamad said the opposition should be ready for any development, including Parliament being dissolved early.
He added that Mahathir did not have a strong mandate as prime minister with Pakatan Harapan (PH), unlike his first tenure in the 1980s.
“He was chosen from a party that has only 13 seats. He himself said he had to ask for permission from DAP to become prime minister because DAP and PKR hold the majority of seats in Parliament,” he added.
Mohamad, who is Barisan Nasional’s candidate for the Rantau by-election, said the coalition lost the May 9 polls due to a lack of strategy and because of three-cornered fights with parties like PAS.
He also sought to allay concerns within the party over Umno’s alliance with the Islamist party.
“We lost 30 seats in Parliament because of three-cornered fights. If we had this understanding, we would not have lost those seats.
“That is why I am confident that with the understanding we have reached on uniting all Malaysians, especially Malay Muslims, we will be able to wrest the government from PH at the next general election.”
The by-election will pit Mohamad against PH candidate Dr Streram Sinnasamy from PKR as well as independents Mohd Nor Yassin and Malar Rajaram. Subscribe to our newsletter and get news delivered to your mailbox. TAGS"
Florida man says pipe bombs weren't meant to hurt anybody,www.providencejournal.com,The Associated Press,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.providencejournal.com/zz/news/20190402/florida-man-says-pipe-bombs-werent-meant-to-hurt-anybody/1?rssfeed=true,"Florida man says pipe bombs weren't meant to hurt anybody Tuesday Apr 2, 2019 at 11:24 PM Cesar Sayoc said in a letter to a judge that was made public Tuesday that it was never his intent to harm anyone.
NEW YORK — A Florida man who pleaded guilty to sending pipe bombs to CNN and prominent critics of President Donald Trump says he thinks he was misunderstood at his guilty plea.
Cesar Sayoc said in a letter to a judge that was made public Tuesday that it was never his intent to harm anyone.
U.S. District Judge Jed S. Rakoff asked prosecutors and defense lawyers whether Sayoc's comments in his March 23 letter will impact a guilty plea he entered two weeks ago regarding the fall mailings. In an order, Rakoff gave lawyers a week to comment.
During the plea proceeding, Rakoff asked Sayoc if he knew the devices would hurt anyone.
In his handwritten letter, Sayoc said his lawyer told him to say yes.
""In my heart I wanted to say no,"" he said. ""I answered under extreme emotional circumstances.""
Sayoc noted that he answered the question just after crying as he read a statement describing his crimes. He said he was returned to the Metropolitan Correctional Center, where he reconsidered his answer.
""I realized that it was the wrong thing to say, because under no circumstances my intent was to hurt or harm anyone. The intention was to only intimidate and scare,"" he wrote.
Sayoc, 57, could face life in prison at sentencing Sept. 12 after pleading guilty to various explosives-related crimes in a deal with prosecutors. If convicted at trial, he could have faced a mandatory life sentence.
Sayoc admitted sending 16 rudimentary bombs — none of which detonated — to targets including Hillary Clinton, former Vice President Joe Biden, several members of Congress, former President Barack Obama and actor Robert De Niro. Devices were also mailed to CNN offices in New York and Atlanta.
The bombs began turning up over a five-day stretch weeks before the midterms. They were mailed to addresses in New York, New Jersey, Delaware, California, Washington, D.C., and Atlanta, Georgia.
Sayoc was arrested in late October at a Florida auto parts store. He had been living in a van plastered with Trump stickers and images of Trump opponents with crosshairs over their faces.
Prosecutors and defense lawyers did not comment Tuesday on Rakoff's order. "

HOUSTON (AP) "" The Latest on a fire at a Houston-area chemical plant (all times local):
9:45 p.m.
The state of Texas has filed a court petition seeking action against a company whose plant caught fire near Houston on Tuesday.
One worker was killed and two were injured critically in the fire at the KMCO chemical plant in Crosby.
The Texas Attorney General's office filed the petition in state district court in Austin on behalf of the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality. The petition seeks a permanent injunction, civil penalties and reasonable attorney fees, court costs, along with recovery of investigative costs.
Harris County had obtained an injunction against KMCO in 2009 that required the firm to pay $100,000 in civil penalties and give investigators easy access to the plant and prompt notification of releases.
___
5:55 p.m.
The CEO of a company whose plant caught fire in Texas says investigators are still determining the cause.
John Foley, president and CEO of KMCO, said at a news conference Tuesday afternoon his company will find the cause of the fire and ""take steps to ensure this doesn't happen again.""
Authorities say one person was killed and two others injured at a fire Tuesday at KMCO's plant in Crosby, near Houston.
Pilar Davis, a product manager with KMCO, says the fire initially ignited with isobutylene and was fueled by ethanol and ethyl acrylate. All three are chemicals and solvents used to make fuel additives at the plant.
Foley says safety and compliance remain his company's ""number one priority.""
Records show KMCO has a history of environmental violations.
___
4:20 p.m.
Authorities say a fire has been contained at a chemical plant near Houston and they have lifted an order that instructed residents within a 1-mile (1.6 kilometers) radius of the facility to stay indoors.
Harris County authorities say first responders are working to prevent the fire from spreading to nearby tanks at the KMCO chemical plant in Crosby.
The Harris County Fire Marshal's Office says the order to shelter in place was lifted Tuesday afternoon, several hours after the fire began.
Schools near the plant had also sheltered in place but school districts lifted those orders as well.
The fire comes about two weeks after a March 17 blaze at a petrochemical storage facility in Deer Park, located about 20 miles (32 kilometers) south of Crosby.
___
2:15 p.m.
The company that owns a Texas chemical plant where fire broke out has had environmental violations in the past.
In 2016, KMCO's corporate agents pleaded guilty to a federal criminal charge of violating the Clean Air Act. A plea agreement document stated that a plant employee made false entries in logs of air testing of tanks that were known to be leaking chemicals. Another employee then used those falsified logs to submit reports to the federal and state environmental authorities. The document says the violation went on between 2008 and 2012.
A year earlier, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency cited KMCO for failing to comply with regulations on its risk-management plan for the plant, but settled with the plant for a $2,700 penalty.
Texas has served the plant with three notices of violation of a federal clean-air law since last August, the EPA website shows.
___
1:15 p.m.
The president and CEO of a company whose plant caught fire in Texas says crews are working with local fire responders to extinguish the blaze.
John Foley is president and chief executive officer of KMCO, whose plant in Crosby caught fire Tuesday. Authorities say one person was killed and two others injured.
Foley says the company is ""deeply saddened"" to confirm the injuries and fatality. He says the company has activated its emergency response team and incident command center because of the blaze.
Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez says that preliminary information shows that isobutylene initially started the fire, and is still burning.
Isobutylene is a flammable colorless gas used in the production of high octane gasoline.

1 p.m.
Authorities say one person is confirmed dead after a fire at a chemical plant near Houston.
Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez says two other people were life-flighted after the fire broke out Tuesday at KMCO in Crosby. Their conditions weren't immediately known.
Gonzalez says preliminary information shows that the chemical isobutylene initially started the fire, and is still burning. Thick plumes of black smoke could be seen rising from the plant.
Residents who live within 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) of the plant have been told to stay indoors with their windows closed and heating and cooling systems turned off.

12:50 p.m.
Authorities have told residents within a 1-mile radius of a burning chemical plant near Houston to stay indoors.
Tuesday's fire at the KMCO chemical plant in Crosby comes about two weeks after a March 17 blaze at a petrochemical storage facility in Deer Park, located about 20 miles (32 kilometers) south of Crosby.
The Harris County Sheriff's Office issued the shelter-in-place order for residents within 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) of the KMCO plant. Emergency officials say people should turn off all fans and heating and cooling systems, and to go into an interior room with no windows.
Schools near the plant are also sheltering in place.
According to its web site, KMCO is a chemical company that offers coolant and brake fluid products and chemicals for the oilfield industry.

12:20 p.m.
Fire officials in Texas say early reports show that one person is unaccounted for and two people are injured after a fire at a Houston-area chemical plant.
The Harris County Fire Marshal's Office says the fire is burning at a KMCO chemical plant in Crosby, a northeast Houston suburb. Thick plumes of black smoke could be seen rising from the plant.
One employee told Houston television station KPRC that the plant was in the process of being evacuated because workers were told that there was a leak of some sort.
The employee said the plant exploded as about 20 workers were leaving. He said employees had to crawl under a gate because the gate was locked.
___
12:01 p.m.
A fire has erupted at a Houston-area chemical plant, spewing a plume of thick, black smoke into the air, and authorities say two workers may have been hurt.
Harris county Sheriff Ed Gonzalez says in a tweet that deputies were shutting down a roadway near Tuesday's fire at a KMCO chemical plant in Crosby, a northeast Houston suburb.
Thick plumes of black smoke could be seen rising from the plant.
The fire comes about two weeks after a March 17 blaze at a petrochemical storage facility in Deer Park, located about 20 miles (32 kilometers) south of Crosby.
According to its web site, KMCO is a chemical company that offers coolant and brake fluid products and chemicals for the oilfield industry.
The Crosby and Sheldon school districts have asked students and staff to shelter in place at all their campuses. "
Philippine Supreme Court orders release of drug war evidence,www.providencejournal.com,"Jim Gomez, The Associated Press",04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.providencejournal.com/ZZ/news/20190402/philippine-supreme-court-orders-release-of-drug-war-evidence?rssfeed=true,"Philippine Supreme Court orders release of drug war evidence Jim Gomez, The Associated Press Tuesday Apr 2, 2019 at 10:40 PM Apr 2, 2019 at 10:40 PM
MANILA, Philippines (AP) "" The Philippine Supreme Court on Tuesday ordered the release of police documents on thousands of killings of suspects in the president's anti-drug crackdown, in a ruling that human rights groups said could shed light on allegations of extrajudicial killings.
Supreme Court spokesman Brian Keith Hosaka said the court ordered the government solicitor-general to provide the police reports to two rights groups which had sought them. The 15-member court, whose justices are meeting in northern Baguio city, has yet to rule on a separate petition to declare President Rodrigo Duterte's anti-drug campaign unconstitutional.
Solicitor-General Jose Calida had earlier agreed to release the voluminous police documents to the court but rejected the requests of the two groups, the Free Legal Assistance Group and the Center for International Law, arguing that such a move would undermine law enforcement and national security.
The two groups welcomed the court order.
""It's a big step forward for transparency and accountability,"" said Jose Manuel ""Chel"" Diokno, who heads the Free Legal Assistance Group.
He said the documents will help the group of human rights lawyers scrutinize the police-led crackdown that was launched when Duterte came to office in mid-2016, and the massive number of killings that the president and police say occurred when suspects fought back and endangered law enforcers, Diokno said.
""This is an emphatic statement by the highest court of the land that it will not allow the rule of law to be trampled upon in the war on drugs. It is a very important decision,"" said Joel Butuyan, president of the Center for International Law.
""These documents are the first step toward the long road to justice for the petitioners and for thousands of victims of the 'war on drugs' and their families,"" Butuyan said.
More than 5,000 mostly poor drug suspects have died in purported gunbattles with the police, alarming Western governments, U.N. rights experts and human rights watchdogs. Duterte has denied ordering illegal killings, although he has publicly threatened drug suspects with death.
The thousands of killings have sparked the submission of two complaints of mass murder to the International Criminal Court. Duterte has withdrawn the Philippines from the court.
After holding public deliberations on the two groups' petitions in 2017, the Supreme Court ordered the solicitor-general to submit documents on the anti-drug campaign, including the list of people killed in police drug raids from July 1, 2016, to Nov. 30, 2017, and documents on many other suspected drug-linked deaths in the same period that were being investigated by police.

Australian senator censured for blaming Muslim victims,www.providencejournal.com,"Rod Mcguirk, The Associated Press",04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.providencejournal.com/ZZ/news/20190402/australian-senator-censured-for-blaming-muslim-victims?rssfeed=true,"Australian senator censured for blaming Muslim victims Rod Mcguirk, The Associated Press Tuesday Apr 2, 2019 at 10:35 PM Apr 2, 2019 at 10:35 PM
CANBERRA, Australia (AP) "" An Australian senator was censured by his colleagues on Wednesday for seeking to blame the victims of last month's mosque shootings and vilify Muslims.
Sen. Fraser Anning was the target of widespread condemnation for blaming the attack in New Zealand on immigration policies. He faced more criticism later for physically striking a teenager who cracked a raw egg on his head in a viral incident in Melbourne.
On Parliament's second sitting day since the March 15 attack in which 50 people died, government and opposition lawmakers moved the censure motion against Anning for divisive comments ""seeking to attribute blame to victims of a horrific crime and to vilify people on the basis of religion, which do not reflect the opinions of the Australian Senate or the Australian people.""
""Sen. Anning's comments were ugly and divisive. They were dangerous and unacceptable from anyone, let alone a member of this place,"" Government Senate Leader Mathias Cormann told the Senate.
Anning dismissed the censure motion as an attack on free speech. ""It is also an exercise in left-wing virtue signaling of the worst kind,"" he told the Senate before the vote.
He sits as an independent lawmaker after defecting from the anti-Muslim One Nation party, whose two senators abstained from the censure vote.
One Nation Sen. Peter Georgiou read a speech on behalf of party leader Pauline Hanson, who was absent.
Hanson said while Anning's comments were ""untimely and therefore deemed highly insensitive, he still maintains a right to his opinion.""
""If One Nation endorses your action to censure Sen. Anning, your freedom of speech as elected members of this chamber will be removed,"" the speech said.
A day after the Christchurch attacks, Anning faced more criticism for physically striking the teenager who cracked an egg on his head at a Melbourne public appearance "" 17-year-old Will Connolly, who became known around the world as ""Egg Boy.""
Anning on Wednesday criticized Prime Minister Scott Morrison for saying at the time that Anning should ""be subject to the full force of the law"" for his retaliation against Connolly. Police investigated the altercation but no charges have been announced.
""It might have only been an idiot with an egg this time, but there is a continuum that begins with this and ends with a fanatic with a gun or a bomb,"" Anning said.
""But apparently, according to Prime Minister Morrison, that's OK, as long as the victims are conservatives,"" he added.
After New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern previously called Anning's comments on the shootings ""a disgrace,"" her deputy Winston Peters on Tuesday called Anning a ""jingoistic moron.""
Anning came under blistering criticism over tweets within hours of the massacre, including one that said, ""Does anyone still dispute the link between Muslim immigration and violence?""
""The real cause of the bloodshed on New Zealand streets today is the immigration program which allowed Muslim fanatics to migrate to New Zealand in the first place,"" he said in a later statement.
Australian white supremacist Brenton Tarrant has been charged with murder in the shootings and is due to appear in a New Zealand court on Friday. "

FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) "" A woman carrying two Chinese passports and a device containing computer malware lied to Secret Service agents and briefly gained admission to President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago club over the weekend during his Florida visit, federal prosecutors allege in court documents.
Yujing Zhang, 32, approached a Secret Service agent at a checkpoint outside the Palm Beach club early Saturday afternoon and said she was a member who wanted to use the pool, court documents said. She showed the passports as identification.
Agents say she wasn't on the membership list, but a club manager thought Zhang was the daughter of a member. Agents say that when they asked Zhang if the member was her father, she did not answer definitively but they thought it might be a language barrier and admitted her.
Zhang's story changed when she got inside, agents say, telling a front desk receptionist she was there to attend the United Nations Chinese American Association event scheduled for that evening. No such event was scheduled and agents were summoned.
Agent Samuel Ivanovich wrote in court documents that Zhang told him that she was there for the Chinese American event and had come early to familiarize herself with the club and take photos, again contradicting what she had said at the checkpoint. She showed him an invitation in Chinese that he could not read.
He said Zhang was taken off the grounds and told she could not be there. Ivanovich said she became argumentative, so she was taken to the local Secret Service office for questioning.
There, he said, it became clear Zhang speaks and reads English well. He said Zhang said she had traveled from Shanghai to attend the nonexistent Mar-a-Lago event on the invitation of an acquaintance named ""Charles,"" whom she only knew through a Chinese social media app. Ivanovich said she then denied telling the checkpoint agents she was a member wanting to swim.
Ivanovich said Zhang carried four cellphones, a laptop computer, an external hard drive and a thumb drive containing computer malware. She did not have a swimsuit.
""While the Secret Service does not determine who is permitted to enter the club, our agents and officers conduct physical screenings to ensure no prohibited items are allowed onto the property,"" a U.S. Secret Service spokesperson said in a statement. ""This access does not afford an individual proximity to the President or other Secret Service protectees. In such instances, additional screening and security measures are employed.""
Zhang is charged with making false statements to federal agents and illegally entering a restricted area. She remains in custody pending a hearing next week. Her public defender, Robert Adler, declined comment.
There is no indication Zhang was ever near the president. There is also no indication that she is connected to Li Yang, a Chinese native, Republican donor and former Florida massage parlor owner.
Yang recently made news after it was learned she was promising Chinese business leaders that her consulting firm could get them access to Mar-a-Lago, where they could mingle with the president. "

Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaidó says he knows he runs the risk of being arrested for pushing to oust President Nicolas Maduro. �
But a defiant Guaidó said Tuesday that he is undeterred. The 35-year-old opposition leader spoke publicly moments after an assembly loyal to Maduro stripped him of his immunity from prosecution.
The move by the National Constituent Assembly paves the way for his prosecution and potential arrest for supposedly violating the constitution when he declared himself interim president.
Guaidó has backing from more than 50 nations, including the United States, which reject Maduro as illegitimately elected.
Maduro blames Washington for trying to install a puppet government to seize Venezuela's vast oil reserves.

Maduro loyalists stripped Venezuela's Juan Guaidó of immunity Tuesday, paving the way for the opposition leader's prosecution and potential arrest for supposedly violating the constitution when he declared himself interim president.
But whether the government of President Nicolas Maduro will take action against the 35-year-old lawmaker remains unclear. Guaidó has embarked on an international campaign to topple the president's socialist administration amid deepening social unrest in the country plagued by nearly a month of power outages.
He declared himself Venezuela's interim president in January, and vowed to overthrow Maduro. So far, however, Maduro has avoided jailing the man that the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump and roughly 50 other nations recognize as Venezuela's legitimate leader.
The Trump administration has threatened the Maduro government with a strong response if Guaido is harmed and Florida Senator Marco Rubio "" who has Trump's ear on Venezuela policy "" said before the vote that nations recognizing Guaidó as his country's legitimate leader should take any attempt by Maduro's government to ""abduct"" him as a coup.
""And anyone who cooperates with this should be treated as a coup plotter & dealt with accordingly,"" Rubio said on Twitter. "
WATCH: Finnish Right-Wingers’ Election Film BANNED by Global Cinema Giant,www.prisonplanet.com,admin,04-02-2019,2019,4,https://www.prisonplanet.com/watch-finnish-right-wingers-election-film-banned-by-global-cinema-giant.html,"Sputnik April 2, 2019
The six-minute long video offers a graphic depiction of politicians and journalists taking bribes and migrants ravishing Finnish women and children.
The immigration-critical Finns Party’s election ad has been banned from Finnish cinemas weeks before the parliamentary election. The artfully directed video, which is reminiscent of a bombastic Hollywood production shows how the Finns Party intends to break up the political establishment.
The video, called “A story of being seriously pissed off”, portrays the Finnish elites as a hotbed of corruption, greed and betrayal. Finland’s Eurocrats are shown as a sleek, self-serving clique enjoying a luxurious life are openly accused of having “forsaken its fatherland’s culture, traditions and its values”. “Through their legislation and taxation, they robbed their own more and more, while at the same time opening their country’s borders to the foreign nations of the world,” the narrator says; an animated, dark-skinned man with a beard is shown saying “I’m only seventeen”.
The video then shows blond girls being assaulted by immigrants, whom the narrator describes as “those who never needed a place of refuge”. “The country that was once a safe place for the women and children was now a place of the past”, the narrator says as dramatic music plays. “These decision-makers took their country’s media and made it into their own propaganda platform,” the video further asserts. Those who dare to oppose, are being branded racists.
The video culminates with a thriller, ending with a hero defeating the ugly monster, whereupon Finns leader Jussi Halla-aho calmly explains that in reality, no one will come and save anybody. According to him, the old parties won’t change their objectives, which is why his compatriots themselves need to vote for change.
Following criticism from left-wing activists, Finland’s cinema company Finnkino, which is owned by US-based AMC Theaters, decided to stop the Finns’ election film from being aired in their cinemas.
“Finnkino stands up for tolerance, freedom of expression and democracy, and does not accept racism or discrimination,” Finnkino tweeted .
This marks a conspicuous U-turn, since Finnkino originally announced they had no problems with the video.
Nevertheless, within a matter of several days, the Finnish version of the film gathered hundreds of thousands of views on YouTube.
Meanwhile, Finland is heading toward a general election on 14 April, and recent surveys suggest a major hike in popularity for the Finns , who suffered a bitter schism in 2017. Half of the party, including its founder and perennial leader Timo Soini, left to form the Blue Reform party. In Finnish and Swedish, the Finns are still known as the True Finns and remain opposed to globalisation and immigration.
Recent polls place the Finns third with 15.1 percent, up from single-digit performance in opinion polls following the schism. Äänestetään Suomi takaisin. #vaalit2019 #jotainrajaa

A Volcano That Could Completely Cover Mexico City With Volcanic Ash Just Erupted 200 Times In A 24 Hour Period,www.prisonplanet.com,admin,04-02-2019,2019,4,https://www.prisonplanet.com/a-volcano-that-could-completely-cover-mexico-city-with-volcanic-ash-just-erupted-200-times-in-a-24-hour-period.html,"Economic Collapse April 2, 2019
The most dangerous volcano in Mexico just erupted 200 times in a 24 hour period, but there has been an almost total blackout about this in the U.S. media.
Authorities are saying that the odds of more volcanic activity at Mt. Popocatepetl are “immediate to high”, and if a full-blown Plinian eruption were to occur it would be the worst natural disaster in the modern history of North America. Approximately 26 million people live within 60 miles of Popocatepetl’s crater, and so we are talking about the potential for death and destruction on a scale that is difficult to imagine. In ancient times, Mt. Popocatepetl buried entire Aztec cities in super-heated mud , but then it went to sleep for about 1,000 years. Unfortunately for us, it started waking up again in the 1990s, and now this is the most active that we have seen it ever since the volcano originally reawakened.
What we have witnessed over the last several days has been nothing short of stunning. According to a British news source , a level three yellow alert was put into effect after “200 eruptions were recorded in just 24 hours”…
Popocatépetl volcano, just 35 miles from Mexico City and 20 miles from Puebla sent ash and plumes of smoke more than 1.5 miles high. Mexico’s National Centre for Disaster Prevention (CENAPRED) has warned people to keep away from Popocatépetl after 200 eruptions were recorded in just 24 hours . A level three yellow alert has been issued meaning the chance of volcanic activity is immediate to high.
At this point a 7.5 mile “security radius” has been established around the volcano, and if things continue to get worse authorities will be forced to begin large scale evacuations.
Hopefully there will be enough warning before a Plinian eruption occurs, because several towns could be completely buried by super-heated mud traveling at 60 miles per hour …
While not every Plinian-sized eruption is alike in ferocity, all the volcanologists I spoke with provided grave details about Popo’s sure devastation. First, you would see 1,000-degree lahars and pyroclastic flows speeding down at 60 mph . Those flows would reach most, if not all, of the towns in the High Risk area, which today include Santiago Xalitzintla (population: 2,196), and San Pedro Benito Juarez (3,153), and Buenavista (814).
No human on the entire planet can run that fast. If people are able to get to their vehicles in time they would have a chance, but in reality the highways would quickly become completely clogged as thousands of escaping vehicles all converged at the same time.
Mexico City would be out of range of the tsunami of super-heated mud, but the truth is that the volcanic ash would kill far more people. Even just breathing in the volcanic ash could potentially be a death sentence …
The real threat, of course, begins after the lava halts. If the wind blew in Mexico City’s direction, a city-sized cloud of ash 20 centimeters thick would descend upon the buildings, dismantling roadways, shutting down airports and the Metro line. Breathing it in could kill you. And that’s just the first day. After that, seeping ash would clog Mexico City’s drainage lines, poisoning its water supplies , and ceasing electricity transmission via short-circuiting. With food supplies cut off, and no electricity, the dense metropolis would probably resemble something like the World Trade Center the night of September 11th, except with three times as many people attempting to flee. All under the veil of an ash-blackened sky.
Ultimately, we are talking about an event that would mean the end of the modern nation of Mexico as we know it today, and this is the most active that Mt. Popocatepetl has been in any of our lifetimes.
Are you starting to understand why I get so frustrated with the mainstream media? What is happening to Mt. Popocatepetl should be front page news all over the county, and yet the mainstream media is almost completely ignoring it.
Meanwhile, a volcano in Washington state is starting to vent steam and gas.
I’ll bet you hadn’t heard about that either.
Mount Baker is 31 miles due east of Bellingham, Washington, and all throughout the month of March steam and gas have been pouring out of the volcano …
The state’s quartet of the potentially eruptive peaks are all part of the Cascade Mountain Range, and the northernmost is Mount Baker, which is located in Whatcom County, 31 miles east of Bellingham.
On March 4, the 10,781-foot-tall volcano began producing a number of steam plumes known as fumaroles . The expulsions have continued throughout the month since then and several have been highly visible from many miles away and widely captured in photographs and cell phone videos.
Those of you that are familiar with my work know that I am much more concerned about Mt. Rainier , and when that volcano starts venting steam and gas I am likely to really start freaking out. But Mount Baker is a very serious threat too because of its “proximity to human population” …
Mount Baker last erupted in 1843, but in several recent publications, the U.S. Geological Survey has maintained that Washington state’s third-highest peak continues to present a serious threat due to the frequency of its eruptive history and the volcano’s proximity to human population .
We are seeing a rise in seismic activity all along the Ring of Fire, and as I have frequently warned, North America will not be immune from what is taking place.
The entire west coast lies directly along the Ring of Fire, and seismologists assure us that it is just a matter of time before we witness absolutely massive natural disasters.
And with all of the shaking that is currently going on, the truth is that time may be running out a lot more quickly than many of us had been anticipating… 5:13 "
War Rhetoric: Iran Claims To Have The “Father of All Bombs”,www.prisonplanet.com,admin,04-02-2019,2019,4,https://www.prisonplanet.com/war-rhetoric-iran-claims-to-have-the-father-of-all-bombs.html,"SHTFplan.com April 2, 2019
Overshadowing the United States’ “mother of all bombs” or the MOAB, Iran is now claiming to have the “father of all bombs.” The inflammatory claim was made by a top commander of Iran’s Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC).
The bomb was developed under a special request of the IRGC, the corps’ Aerospace Force commander, Brigadier General Amir Ali Hajizadeh, said in an interview on Friday, according to RT . “Following a proposal by the Aerospace Force of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC), [Iran’s] Defense Industries [Organization] manufactured a 10-ton bomb. These bombs are at our disposal,” PressTV cited the commander as saying. “ They can be launched from Ilyushin aircraft and they are highly destructive, ” he added, without providing any further details on the capabilities of the ordinance.
The Iranian commander compared the “father of all bombs” to the U.S.’s MOAB. The new Iranian name, however, might trigger a bomb naming dispute with Russia, as they have already possessed a non-nuclear ordnance known as the “ daddy,” for its previously dubbing: the “father of all bombs.”
“Wars And Rumors Of Wars”: The U.S., Venezuela, Cuba, Russia, India And Pakistan All Move Closer To Military Conflict
Russia’s daddy was technically the first FOAB. The Aviation Thermobaric Bomb of Increased Power, known as the “father of all bombs” (FOAB), was successfully tested by Russia in 2007. It was said to have impressive results for a non-nuclear device. The “daddy” will net a 44-ton yield when detonated. The bomb also explodes mid-air, and vaporizes its targets, collapses structures, and leaves a “moon-like scorched landscape”. “We believe it’s real,” said retired Col. Rick Francona, a military analyst and former US military attache in Syria. “The Russians have been among the pioneers of these thermobaric bombs,” the analyst said according to CNN in 2017. “I don’t have any doubt that they could build this,” Francona said. “It falls under their [Russia’s] technological capabilities.”
But that won’t stop Iran from claiming they also have a FOAB and further amplifying the already immense war rhetoric. 5:10 "
