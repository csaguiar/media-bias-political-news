House Democrats Vote To Subpoena Mueller Report | Zero Hedge,www.zerohedge.com,,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2019-04-03/house-democrats-vote-subpoena-mueller-report,"0 SHARES
The House Judiciary Committee chaired by Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-NY) voted Wednesday to authorize a subpoena to compel the Department of Justice (DOJ) to hand the Mueller report over to Congress.
Passing by a margin of 24-17, the resolution authorizes subpoenas for special counsel Robert Mueller's full report, as well as its underlying evidence.
Attorney General William Barr did not comply with an April 2 deadline set by Nadler, who has criticized the four-page summary of conclusions on what is believed to be a nearly 400-page report.
Barr and Mueller are currently working to redact sensitive information ahead of the report's full public release, which Barr should be ready by mid-April or sooner, according to comments made by Barr to lawmakers last week. In a letter to House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) and Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) on Friday, Barr wrote that the public version of the report would be scrubbed of sensitive national security information that could compromise sources and methods; grand jury material; information that could impact ongoing investigations; and “information that would unduly infringe on the personal privacy and reputational interests of peripheral third parties. ” - The Hill
A redacted report in two weeks isn't enough for House Democrats, who have demanded the immediate release of Mueller's report - with no redactions .
Nadler was singing a different tune in 1998 when the Clinton report was finished, however - advocating for redactions ""as a matter of decency and protecting people's privacy rights."" Rep. Jerry Nadler wants to see the full Mueller report, exactly the opposite of what he said in 1998 when the Clinton report was finished 🤷‍♂️ pic.twitter.com/Z62JPV9iu4 — Wojciech Pawelczyk 🇵🇱 (@PolishPatriotTM) April 2, 2019 Login"

Corruption Economics Technology Trade/Globalization Welfare Labor One's first impulse on coming across yet another book on globalization, even (or particularly?) by a Nobel-caliber economist, is surely to keep on moving: Most turn out to be dry treatises that end up convincing readers they were right to hate their economics courses in college.
It's an impulse worth resisting in the case of Jagdish Bhagwati's In Defense of Globalization , a book that amuses as it instructs. The author, a professor at Columbia University and one of the world's leading scholars of international trade and development, has grappled in many arenas with nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) -- the leaders in the fight against ""globalization,"" the process of economic integration of nations through trade and international flows of capital and people. He understands why NGOs fear that globalization causes social ills. But while he concedes that some of the anti-globalizers' complaints have merit, he is bold enough to label their arguments ""rubbish"" when warranted.
Bhagwati concludes that fears of globalization deserve an ""extended and careful response,"" not out-of-hand dismissal, but are in the end ""a false alarm."" He is mostly satisfied with what globalization has accomplished. But some of his recommendations for moving it to a next step, one more congenial to its current ideological enemies, are ultimately unconvincing.
Bhagwati's book starts by discussing the rise of the NGO movement because, as he generously acknowledges, the debates over the effects over globalization today owe their ""salience, shape and content"" to this movement. But he slyly suggests that the NGOs' rise might be more in the number of groups than in the number of citizens they represent. Take pity, he says, on poor Nigel Wilkinson, whose branch of the Radical Left Movement for Socialist Revolution had to be disbanded after the group's membership dwindled ""by almost 70 percent over the last year from a peak of three members to just one -- himself.""
Wilkinson's sad fate notwithstanding, the NGO movement has grown into a global phenomenon. Bhagwati offers a variety of explanations. Among the poorer nations, the expansion in the education of women is a cause; in India these days, Bhagwati jokes, it's easier to attract a bride by offering her an NGO than by offering her a green card. In transition economies, he says, NGOs were a natural outgrowth of the ""parallel politics"" developed by Vaclav Havel and others as a ""weapon for democratic progress in regimes governed by communists."" But it is in the rich countries -- and particularly among the young there -- that the NGO movement has really taken off.
The young, says Bhagwati, see (or think they see) capitalism failing to deliver social justice. Lacking direct experience or historical knowledge of socialism, they don't realize it was in earlier systems that ""the well-connected...could jump"" queues, while capitalism allows ""a larger number to make it to the check-out counter."" Bhagwati also credits television images with increasing the empathy of the young in rich countries for the effects of poverty, famines, and civil wars in poorer areas of the world.
This book tries to show that major complaints about the adverse social effects of globalization are mistaken. Globalization in fact reduces poverty and the use of child labor, fosters women's rights, promotes respect for democratic norms, enriches culture, and even sustains the environment. Multinational corporations are not wreaking havoc by leveling wages and labor standards across the globe. In fact, they raise them. The ""gotcha"" examples produced by anti-globalizers of the occasional social harm done by globalization are exceptions and not the rule.
To show that globalization eases poverty, Bhagwati offers a tale of two continents. In 1970 average African incomes were 30 percent higher than average Asian incomes. Thirty years later, African incomes had remained stagnant and were then half of Asian incomes. While there were undoubtedly many causes of this reversal, Bhagwati documents that a primary one was that Asia opened itself and adapted to external markets while Africa did not. As a result, in 1970 Africa was home to about 10 percent of the world's poor and Asia to more than 75 percent, using standard measures of the absolute level of poverty. Thirty years later Africa had more than a third of the world's poor and Asia's share had declined to just 15 percent.
Looking more closely at developments within Asia bolsters the point. Who can doubt, Bhagwati asks, that the dramatic reductions in poverty in China and India came about only when these countries began integrating with the world economy, mimicking the tactics of Japan, Korea, and Singapore? Trade and foreign direct investment boost growth, and growth reduces poverty.
Growing incomes from globalization then translate into progress toward social and environmental goals. Child labor falls, Bhagwati writes, because ""when incomes improve, poor parents can generally be expected to respond by putting children back in school."" This is exactly what happened, for instance, in the 1990s in Vietnam. Households used extra income from liberalized rice exports to put their children, and particularly their older girls, in school. And increased foreign competition -- like competition more generally -- narrows the gender wage gap. Bhagwati laments the attempts of feminist NGOs such as Women's Edge to force multilateral institutions to analyze the ""gender effects"" of their actions. ""Women, as a class, are not destined to lose from progress,"" he says. To demand, as the NGOs do, that every World Trade Organization (WTO) ruling be examined specifically from the viewpoint of women's welfare is, Bhagwati writes, ""about as compelling as saying that the removal of potholes from New York's roads be subjected to a prior examination of whether women are more likely to fall into them.""
A country's environmental quality also improves with sustained income growth because economic activity tends to shift away from pollution-intensive primary production and manufacturing toward service industries. At between $5,000 and $6,000 annual income per capita, income growth and environmental gains go hand in hand. Many countries are still far from this income level, but Bhagwati notes that because technology is constantly getting more environment-friendly, developing countries are starting to see their environmental quality improve at a much lower income threshold.
Another common complaint about globalization -- generally from Westerners rather than the cultures allegedly despoiled by Westerners -- is that it spreads an unlovely cultural homogenization. Bhagwati observes that the fear of ""McDonaldization"" is prevalent in all strata of French society, from the radical farmer José Bové to Alain Rollat of Le Monde, who declared that ""resistance to the hegemonic pretenses of hamburgers is, above all, a cultural imperative."" But the evidence is that McDonald's is quite responsive to local sensitivities. The golden arches have disappeared in some of the branches around Paris, the company's traditional red-and-yellow colors have been replaced by more muted tones, and espresso and brioche are now offered where culturally appropriate.
While generally indulgent toward globalization and skeptical about its opposition, Bhagwati is not a markets-above-all ideologue. He is unhappy, for example, with unregulated global flows of short-term capital, which he thinks devastated many Asian countries during the financial crisis of 1997�98. He rejects notions that Asians were in any way to blame for the crisis, calling it a ""scapegoating of victims"" put forward by those ""with a desire to...maintain ideological positions in favor of...free capital flows.""
The premature opening of capital accounts undoubtedly played some role in triggering the Asian crisis. But Bhagwati's analysis gives short shrift to other causes, such as the fixed exchange rate systems maintained by the Asian countries, the build-up of debt during the boom years, weaknesses in their corporate and financial systems, and, in the case of Indonesia, the corruption of Suharto's regime. Bhagwati's analysis runs the risk of providing false comfort to developing countries that financial crises can be staved off by throwing sand in the wheels to slow the entry of short-term foreign capital and imposing capital controls to keep it from flowing out.
So Bhagwati thinks multinationals' capital shouldn't necessarily be able to flow wherever it wishes. He also thinks ideas should flow freer than those companies wish. He condemns lobbying by multinationals for intellectual property protection through the WTO, arguing that trade and intellectual property should be separate issues. He says their forced union in the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Protection agreement was a triumph of lobbying over logic.
""Pharmaceutical and software companies muscled their way into the WTO and turned it into a royalty-collection agency simply because the WTO can apply trade sanctions,"" Bhagwati writes. Intellectual property is now one of the three legs of a tripod -- the other two being trade in goods and trade in services -- on which the WTO is supposed to rest. Now other lobbies in rich countries want to inject their own agendas into the WTO. The trade unions want a social clause that would trigger trade sanctions against countries if Western labor standards were not met, and the environmentalists want the same done for nature.
Bhagwati suggests some ways to keep globalization going while easing its opponents' concerns. Unfortunately, these ideas are vague, and there's little evidence they'd do much good. Bhagwati wants, for example, to take steps to ""accelerate the pace"" of progress on social issues. That globalization delivers progress on social goals is no reason, he says, not to do more by deploying ""additional policy instruments."" But the major instrument he recommends is ""a good tongue-lashing."" He says ""our ability to zero in on morally offensive practices has increased hugely. Embarrassment, if not shame and even guilt, allow tremendous leverage."" He favors strengthening the review and monitoring functions of international agencies toward this goal of shaming malefactors, but he doesn't provide any convincing examples of where these sorts of instruments have worked as he posits they might."

"No, Bernie Sanders did not say Christianity is an insult to Muslims",www.politifact.com,,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.politifact.com/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2019/apr/02/facebook-posts/no-bernie-sanders-did-not-say-christianity-insult-/,"Quotes Bernie Sanders as saying, ""Christianity is an insult to Muslims."" — Facebook posts on Sunday, March 31st, 2019 in a Facebook post No, Bernie Sanders did not say ‘Christianity is an insult to Muslims’ By Samantha Putterman on Tuesday, April 2nd, 2019 at 2:28 p.m.
In 2017, Sen. Bernie Sanders had some things to say during the nomination hearing for the next deputy director of the White House’s budget office. The nominee, Russell Vought, had written an op-ed on a conservative website in defense of Wheaton College, his Christian alma mater, and Sanders felt some of his language was Islamophobic.
During the entire exchange, though, Sanders did not say, ""Christianity is an insult to Muslims,"" as social media posts and conservative websites have claimed.
A recent Facebook post shares the quote and displays a photo of Sanders with a turban drawn on his head and text that reads: ""Bernie Sanders says Christianity is an insult to Muslims. I SAY BERNIE SANDERS IS A DISGRACE AMERICA.""
The post, which has been shared over 5,700 times, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook. )
The faux quote has been roaming the internet since Vought’s June 7, 2017, nomination hearing , when Sanders questioned his piece on The Resurgent , a website that describes itself on its Facebook page as ""the home of resurgent conservatives online committed to resurgent freedom, faith, and family.""
Vought’s January 2016 piece focused on Wheaton College’s decision to fire a professor who, as Vought puts it, expressed ""controversial comments seeking solidarity with Muslims and her argument that Christians ‘worship the same God.’""
Vought defended the college’s decision, and wrote, ""Muslims do not simply have a deficient theology. They do not know God because they have rejected Jesus Christ his Son, and they stand condemned.""
Sanders took issue with this during the hearing (around 44:30) and asked Vought if he believed the statement was Islamophobic.
""Absolutely not,"" Vought responded. He went on to say he is a Christian and believes in a Christian set of principles.
The two went back and forth, and at one point Sanders said: ""In my view, the statement made by Mr. Vought is indefensible, it is hateful, it is Islamophobic, and it is an insult to over a billion Muslims throughout the world.""
The debate ended at an impasse, with Sanders saying he will vote no. ( Which he did , but with a tally of 49-49, Vice President Mike Pence’s tie-breaking vote pushed Vought through.)
Various media outlets reported on the exchange, and some condemned Sanders' comments as a religious test for public office, which is barred in the U.S. Constitution ( Article VI ). But, eventually, Sanders' words became twisted to suggest he was referencing Christianity as a whole, when he was specifically speaking about Vought’s statement.
Though some may interpret Sanders words as an attack on the entire religion, he did not say, ""Christianity is an insult to Muslims.""
