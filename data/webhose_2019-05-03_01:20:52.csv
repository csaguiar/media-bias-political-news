Revealed! Ugandan Government Owns Only 0.1 Percent Shares Of Uganda Airlines,www.kahawatungu.com,,04-03-2019,2019,4,http://www.kahawatungu.com/2019/03/27/revealed-ugandan-government-owns-1-percent-shares-uganda-airlines/,"Revealed! Ugandan Government Owns Only 0.1 Percent Shares Of Uganda Airlines by March 27, 2019, 2:16 PM 717 Views VIEWS [PHOTO/ COURTESY]
The Ugandan government owns only 0.1 percent of the national carrier, the Uganda Airlines, MPs have revealed.
As if that is not enough, it has been revealed that the Ugandan government does not own the rights to the Uganda Airline name, as it has been patented by an undisclosed individual.
The revelations were made amid approval of Ush280 billion (Ksh7.6 billion) supplementary budget for the purchase of the first two Bombardier planes from Canada for the airline.
The plans to revive the carrier which has not been on operation were pioneered by President Yoweri Museveni who in 2016 said that it was a shame to lack a national carrier.
However, it seems the biggest beneficiary will not be the people of Uganda, and the government doesn’t care.
“It’s true the name was registered by someone [who] I also do not know. It’s true the name was used in the Uganda Registration Services Bureau, but what is important is the revival of the national carrier, which we are working on,” the minister of state for Transport, Aggrey Bagiire told the Observer .
“The most important thing is that we shall get another name, which will show the planes are for Uganda,” he added.
Last year, Uganda ordered for four CRJ900 regional jets with Bombardier Commercial Aircraft. The Observer reports that the first jets were supposed to have been delivered in January and February this year, but government kept pushing forward the arrival time.

Uganda now needs to raise the Ksh7.6 billion before March 29 or else the manufacturer will push Uganda’s aircraft orders aside to 2022.
However, in a reports, opposition MPs feel that parting with the amount before a number of irregularities are addressed would be like robbing Ugandans.
“The share capital of Uganda National Airlines Company Limited is 200 million divided into 2 million shares. Of the 2 million shares, only 2 shares worth Shs 200 to minister of Works and Transport as well as ministry of Finance. This makes both ministries to be minority shareholders holding only 0.0001% of the shares. At the moment the owners of the 99.9% shares are unknown. The owners will only be determined when the directors decide to allocate the shores. It was asserted that the majority shares will be floated to the public,” said Lira Woman MP Joy Atim Ongom.

Kenyans Feel Shortchanged By Ugandans After Uhuru-Museveni Talks,www.kahawatungu.com,,04-03-2019,2019,4,http://www.kahawatungu.com/2019/03/29/kenyans-shortchanged-ugandans-after-uhuru-museveni-talks/,"VIEWS [Courtesy]
Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni’s three day visit to Kenya has sparked debate from Kenyans who are questioning the benefits Kenya got from the bilateral talks he had with his Kenyan counterpart President Uhuru Kenyatta.
According to details of the extensive talks Museveni had with Kenyatta, it appears that Uganda achieved more than Kenya did from the trade talks.
In a press release issued by Museveni, the Head of State was glad to inform his citizens that following the talks, Kenya had agreed to increase its sugar exports from 36,000 metric tonnes to 90,000 metric tonnes annually.
He also noted that Ugandan dairy producers will now have less paperwork to do in order to export their milk to Kenya.
In addition to that, his discussions with Kenyatta also opened a way for their tile makers to access the Kenyan market.
If that was not enough, goods destined for Uganda will be cleared in the shortest time possible at the Mombasa Port.
This in particular thrilled Museveni as he noted that Ugandans have grappled with the issue for a while but it was fixed the moment Uhuru took office.
Museveni also mentioned that Kenya had given his countrymen the green light to take advantage of the petroleum facility built in Kisumu to aid them transport their petroleum products across Lake Victoria.
To crown it all, President Uhuru on Thursday announced that Kenya will offer Uganda a piece of land in Naivasha for them to build a dry port.
President Uhuru’s announcement was not taken lightly by Kenyans who were wondering why the head of state would offer our land to Uganda.

Following the bilateral talks however, Kenya was able have the Ugandan government lift the ban on beef imports since the mad cow disease that led to the ban.
President Uhuru also declared that following the talks, the two heads of state had agreed to resolve the Migingo Island scuffle within the next three months.
With that stated, it is clear that our Ugandan neighbors will sure leave Kenya fulfilled as they have achieved more from the bilateral talks.
Kenyans including prominent personalities have questioned the deals made by President Uhuru with most of them noting there is not much to show for the three day talks.
Citizen TV’s Linus Kaikai questioned: “Uganda is Kenya’s largest market and these talks are very important but what is Kenya getting out of these bilateral discussions between Uhuru and Museveni?”
Popular Political Commentator Professor Edward Kisiang’ani also exclaimed: “Just wondering aloud! Isn’t it more beneficial for us to built our own inland port at Naivasha then charge Uganda for using it than giving Uganda our land so it builds its own inland port in our country? I don’t understand this deal . Help me please!”
They were joined by other Kenyans who expression their disappointment concerning the bilateral talks.

Tension as Uganda-Rwanda border remains closed,www.independent.co.ug,,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.independent.co.ug/tension-as-uganda-rwanda-border-remains-closed/,"Home / News / Tension as Uganda-Rwanda border remains closed Tension as Uganda-Rwanda border remains closed The Independent March 14, 2019 News 1 Comment FILE PHOTO: Kyanika, one of the border crossings on the Uganda-Rwanda border
Kampala, Uganda | THE INDEPENDENT | Tension is still high among people living near the Uganda-Rwanda border because of the unresolved dispute between the two countries.
It all started on February 27th, 2019, when Rwanda closed its borders with Uganda in Katuna and Chanika in Kabale and Kisoro districts respectively.
The closure affected hundreds of cargo trucks destined for Rwanda. The Rwandan authorities advised the truck drivers to turn back and use Mirama Hill border in Ntungamo district, which is 100kilometers away.
Initially, Rwanda claimed it had closed the borders to work on the Onestop border post.
However, Rwanda’s Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation Minister, Richard Sezibera issued a travel advisory to their nationals strongly cautioning them against traveling to Uganda, saying their safety isn’t guaranteed.
He later accused Uganda of harboring Rwandan dissidents planning to topple the Kigali government under President, Paul Kagame. Rwandan security also destroyed temporary bridges erected by residents to help them cross to both countries.
The tension between the two countries has triggered concern among residents along the border, saying it is a precursor for war. The tension has also taken a huge toll on business as residents can no longer trade like it was in the past.
Kellen Rwengabo, a resident of Katuna town council, says they are living in fear of war ever since Rwanda started deploying soldier on the hills neighboring the border.
Rwengabo, who sells mattresses and blankets, says all kinds of businesses in Katuna border town are affected because of the border closure.
According to Rwengabo, she would make over a million Shillings each day before the border was closed, but she now only makes 50,000 Shillings.
She however, says Rwandan soldiers dressed in civilian clothes sneak into Uganda at night to buy foodstuffs for their families in Rwanda.
David Baguma Munyankore deals in general merchandise in Katuna border town. According to Baguma, some traders and residents have started relocating to distant places for fear of what might happen.
According to Baguma, even if the dispute is resolved now, it will take days for the traders to recover from their current loses.
He explains that before the border was closed, he would sell maize flour worth Shillings 5 million to Rwandan nationals but he hardly sells Shillings 10,000 since they were blocked from crossing to Uganda.
Ibrahim Twishimiye, a resident of Chanika, which borders Kisoro district, says the situation isn’t different on the side of Rwanda.
He says currently they have to make sure that none of the security officers deployed along the porous border is watching before they cross to Uganda.
Twishimiye says also although Rwanda accuses Uganda of harboring wrong elements targeting its leadership, it was unfair to close the border, which is affecting ordinary people.
Isaac Kyoshabire, a boda boda rider at Katuna border, says because of the tension between the two countries he retires before 08:00pm compared to the past when he would work until 09:00pm.
Fred Tumwesigye, a deal in hides and skins at Katuna border, says Rwandan security has also started harassing Ugandans crossing from Rwanda to Uganda.
Tumwesigye says Rwandan security recently confiscated his 40 hides worth Shillings 160,000 and the bicycle at Gatuna border crossing."

Stephanie Rivoal, the outgoing French Ambassador spoke to The Independent’s Ronald Musoke about her highs and lows of her two-and-half year stay in Uganda.
Uganda was your very first post in your diplomatic career. How have you found your stay here?
It is my belief that modern diplomacy touches three angles and, obviously, politics is number one. A diplomat has to maintain bilateral relations between his or her home country and the country where you are posted. It has been very interesting to get close to the people in positions of power in this country and to push through our messages. The second aspect is the relationship with the private sector; you want to get to know the business opportunities that are present in Uganda and see how French companies can benefit.The third aspect is the relationship with civil society— where you connect with the people directly without going through authorities or official bodies. Thanks to communication tools like; social media networks, television and radio, I endeavoured to talk directly to Uganda’s women, the youth, and everyone else. I am getting out of Uganda having learnt so much.
At the start of your diplomatic engagement, you noted that you were particularly attracted to Uganda because of its geo-politics, business prospects and humanitarian challenges. Do you still maintain you made the right choice in coming here?
I am 100 percent sure that I made the right choice because Uganda is one country from where you can observe many activities in the region thanks to its strategic location. Since I have been here, so many things have happened in the region; from Uganda’s involvement in the peacemaking process in South Sudan, the elections in Congo, the relationship between Uganda and Rwanda which of course is a big topic at the moment, the Burundi situation that is linked with Rwanda to the relationship with Kenya and Tanzania; especially when it comes to the business relations. In terms of business, Kenya is more mature and Tanzania offers a lot of opportunities but it is a bit bureaucratic and tough to work there while Uganda has positioned itself as an outsider wanting to attract foreign investments. But for that to happen Uganda needs to be more attractive and we have had many discussions with the authorities on how to realise that. On the humanitarian front, Uganda remains the number one African country in terms of receiving refugees. The open door policy in Uganda has been something instructive to watch. In spite of some corruption issues, we hope that this globally acclaimed policy can still continue.
Give us some highlights of your stay in Uganda?
The increase in development projects and the strengthening of the defence relationship between the two governments were very important but I think the Women for Women Awards initiative we held in June, 2018, together with other female ambassadors here is something I am particularly proud of. I launched this initiative to put women into the spotlight. I think, at the beginning, the benefits are not obvious because it is not a cheque but I believe the ladies who received the awards in the long run will change the place of women in the private sector in Uganda thanks to the network they have created. I am also extremely proud of the Kampala Geopolitics conference that we did last year. That was some huge amount of work and to do it within Makerere, a university which has a reputation on the continent; to be able to bring here researchers from France and Germany and, of course, local thinkers and researchers was great. The Kampala Geopolitics conference was about freedom of expression, debate and also positioning African students mentally in a place where they need to care and have an opinion on everything in the world. I want the things that I initiated here to have an impact when Iam gone. It is not about me here; it is about France in Uganda looking ahead.
How would you describe the current relations between France and Uganda?
When I first arrived here, I really had no idea how good France’s relations with Uganda were. I thought we were way behind the UK or the U.S. but in fact, I discovered that we already had a very strong relationship with Uganda in terms of development and military cooperation, the collaboration with universities, and Alliance Française. I would describe the relations as excellent. But like I said at the beginning, the relationship between two countries goes beyond the relationship between the two governments.
One of your key performance indicators was to increase the presence of French business in Uganda. How have you fared?
Out of ten, I would say I scored seven. I did three presentations in France to French businesses and for the first time ever, we attracted many delegations here. MEDEF, the largest syndicate of the private sector in France came here for the first time in 2017. Now we are waiting for concrete projects. We have been very active to make sure that the technology of Airbus is selected for the new Uganda Airlines. Of course the oil project is a big one; it was there before I came but I believe it is taking too much time because Ugandans are not benefiting from this oil yet the needs are huge in terms of education, health and jobs for the youth. We have so many French companies waiting to come here to support the project because they are in the oil industry. Many are also positioning themselves for infrastructure, transport and energy. We already have about 40 French companies here— from the super large ones like Bolloré, Total, and Lafarge, to mid-sized ones up to the small ones. Share on:"

Words of Wisdom From Ban Ki-moon – InsideSources,www.insidesources.com,Donald Kirk,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.insidesources.com/words-of-wisdom-from-ban-ki-moon/,"Tweet This
SEOUL — Ban Ki-moon, now that he’s no longer U.N. secretary-general, can offer frank views that would definitely have had North Korean diplomats screaming bloody murder in the U.N. headquarters had he expressed them there.
Ban, ever bland, polite, genial, the essence of the seasoned diplomat, gave about as reasoned and practical a view of the state of talks, or non-talks, with North Korea that you’re likely to hear. It’s not likely, however, that South Korea’s President Moon Jae-in will be looking to Ban for dealing with the North, considering how far apart Ban is from Moon and his retinue.
Ban’s skills should come into play in his new position as head of a commission on fine dust, which Koreans are convinced mostly blows in from China and the Chinese say is produced by Korean factories and vehicles. Ban and Moon, however, don’t think at all alike on getting North Korea to give up its nuclear-and-missile program.
The gulf between them on North Korea was evident at a forum staged by the venerable Kwanhoon Club, an association of senior Korean journalists. While Ban was peppered with questions from reporters ranged on either side of him on stage, some of us had the chance to ask whatever we wanted on forms that were then passed up to the moderator, who relayed them to Ban.
My question, in writing, was what did Ban think of the step-by-step approach to getting North Korea to denuclearize? Also, did he think the North could be trusted to take real “steps” of its own as the U.S. took “steps.” So many people advocate this approach, most notably Moon’s senior foreign policy adviser, Moon Chung-in, who had spoken at the same forum a week or so earlier, that I had half-expected Ban to fall into line.
No way. “It is not easy to conduct salami tactics,” said Ban, talking in Korean. “That’s why we should push a Big Deal” ― a solid agreement on real denuclearization in return for an end to sanctions imposed by the United States and the United Nations after each of the North’s long-range missile and nuclear tests.
It was the big deal, offered by President Trump when he met Kim Jong-un in Hanoi at the end of last month that Kim rejected. Instead, Kim offered to shut down the North’s nuclear complex at Yongbyon, where the North’s worn-down five-megawatt reactor has produced several dozen warheads with plutonium at its core, in return for the United States giving up five sanctions ― the ones that really counted. The Yongbyon reactor, as the Americans were well aware, has not been fabricating nukes for more than a year.
Kim was not about to consider closing facilities elsewhere for making nukes with highly enriched uranium. Ban, uncharacteristically, was disparaging as he talked about the frustrations over the years of dealing with the North Koreans. Six-party talks, chaired by China, also including South and North Korea, the U.S., Japan and Russia, had proven “useless,” he said, especially since the North Koreans stopped attending them years ago.
Anyway, North Korea could simply not be trusted to live up to anything. “They explode a tunnel,” he said, “but judging from the past, how could we believe them?”
That was a reference to the explosion staged last May before the eyes of a select group of television correspondents of the site at Punggye-ri, where the North conducted its sixth, most recent, nuclear test in September 2017. The pyrotechnics made for fine TV, but no scientists were around to confirm the North had really destroyed the tunnel ― or that it had not been largely destroyed in the last nuclear test.
Ban had some words that advocates of step-by-step don’t want to hear. “If you are cheated once, you are cheated,” he said. “If you are cheated two times, you are stupid.”
Lots of stupid people are out there saying, let’s take the small deal and see what we can come up with later. Of course, these people don’t factor in where you go if North Korea does not keep its side of the bargain on even a small deal. As for how you advance from small to big, that is, to real denuclearization, they generally avoid that difficult topic.
Diplomatically, Ban did not directly criticize Moon, either Jae-in or his adviser, Chung-in, for behaving stupidly. Rather, he said, “the Korean government believes in the good heart of North Korea” but “maybe they were cheated.” Nor did he criticize those North-South summits ― all of which Jae-in’s alter ego, Chung-in, attended.
Rather, he said, “I don’t think the process has gone well.” That’s a realistic assessment that the step-by-steppers should take to heart. About the Author Donald Kirk has been a columnist for Korea Times, South China Morning Post, and many other newspapers and magazines. More from Inside Sources "
A Conservative Carbon Tax? Experts Say Yes to a Market-Based Solution to Climate Change – InsideSources,www.insidesources.com,Erin Mundahl,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.insidesources.com/conservative-carbon-tax-experts-say-yes-to-market-based-climate-change-solution/,"Tweet This
Is there a Republican solution to climate change? Looking at Capitol Hill, it’s hard to tell. Liberals have dominated discussion of environmental issues for so long that the odds of bipartisan legislation seem slim. After all, the GOP is seen as the party of business, not environmentalists. A new generation of conservatives are challenging this divide, however, arguing that there is a place for market-based carbon solutions that will help the environment without forcing businesses to swallow the full slate of socialist regulations included in the Green New Deal.
“Conservatives can care about the planet, they can care about mitigating the risks to communities and future generations, [but] they’re often alienated from the environmental movement which has been pushing them out slowly but surely over the last several generations,” says Alex Bozmoski, managing director of the Energy and Enterprise Initiative at RepublicEn . Bozmoski, whose work advocates energy policy that supports limited government and free enterprise, spoke on an event hosted by Climate-XChange.
Conservatives who support strong environmental policy increasingly find themselves without a political home. As a result, the left has had a “veritable monopoly” on policymaking. This makes climate change and carbon reduction difficult issues for conservatives who might agree that a problem exists but reject proposed solutions that increase the scope of government regulation.
“When you hear the problem, you automatically think about what the solution that’s coming next is. And if the solution is totally untenable to you, then its really easy to cope with that by just ignoring the problem,” he continued.
Instead, he and others are arguing that conservatives should take another look at carbon pricing, which would reduce emissions without increasing regulations.
“A carbon price is an integral step in fostering a transition to a carbon-free future,” says Nader Sobhani, a climate policy fellow at Niskanen Center whose work focuses on environmental tax reform and clean energy policy.
He explained that if one accepts that climate change is a real problem demanding government response, there are only a few options on the table.
“You can have a regulatory approach, where you have bureaucrats trying to manage the issue. You can have industrial policy whereby subsidies pick winners and losers and then there’s a carbon price.”
More than regulation, carbon pricing uses the power of free markets to encourage new solutions. Instead of demonizing the fossil fuel industry, it encourages companies and consumers to think in terms of costs and benefits of producing emissions. A carbon pricing scheme could also be paired with reductions of other environmental regulations, further reducing the negative economic impact of carbon reduction.
This is where carbon pricing opens up debate on other conservative issues, such as cutting taxes and reducing regulation. Not only could a carbon pricing program reduce the regulatory burden, it could also be made revenue neutral through the use of rebates or by cutting payroll and other taxes. There are advantages to this type of tax.
“One advantage of the rebate is it is very transparent where the money is going,” says Josiah Neeley, director of energy policy at the R Street Institute, who adds that this makes it clear that a revenue-neutral tax is not intended to fill government coffers.
However, a tax could also be used to reduce payroll taxes or other taxes that target the middle class and small businesses. This is yet another area where conservatives have ample room to debate the pros and cons of different regulatory solutions.
“If you’re more concerned with the macroeconomic impacts, that’s where you use the revenue from the carbon tax to reduce discretionary taxes such as the payroll tax, corporate income tax, those kinds of measures,” says Sobhani, who explains that economic studies have shown that these policies can boost GDP.
On the other hand, reducing those taxes does not address the concern that a carbon tax would be more burdensome for lower income people. Meanwhile, rebates may in fact help improve the wellbeing of these families.
In the end, these are the sorts of policy debates that conservative environmentalists wish America was having. Climate change has been a polarizing issue, meaning that Republican politicians are wary of touching it, but embracing the debate would help ensure that there are pro-market voices addressing it. This would shift environmental regulation in the political sphere where it can be debated, instead of leaving it in the hands of unelected bureaucrats.
In short, it’s a question about choice.
“All of climate policy is trade offs,” said Bozmoski. “This is what we elect legislators to broker.”
“One of the most effective ways to frame the issue is for this this country to be a global leader,” he continued. “We have to unleash the power of our free enterprise system” "
Embrace Biopharmaceutical Innovation to Save Lives – InsideSources,www.insidesources.com,Peter J. Pitts,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.insidesources.com/embrace-biopharmaceutical-innovation-to-save-lives/,"Tweet This
More Americans are beating cancer than ever before. Cancer mortality rates have plummeted 27 percent in the past quarter-century, according to a new study from the American Cancer Society.
This encouraging trend is no accident. Drug companies have invented hundreds of breakthrough therapies in recent years, many of which stop cancer in its tracks. A majority of these medicines have been invented right here in the United States.
There’s a reason for this. America’s intellectual property laws are the best in the world. Drug developers flock to the United States because they know their products will be protected long enough to be worth the investment.
But now, some American politicians want to weaken IP laws, which they believe allow drug companies to set excessively high prices. Gutting IP protections would be a mistake — without them, research would come to a halt, and patients everywhere would suffer.
Drug research is enormously costly. On average, it takes more than a decade — and costs $2.6 billion — to bring just one new drug to market. These projects are also risky. Only a fraction of experimental drugs succeed. Just over 10 percent of medicines that enter into clinical trials are ultimately approved by the FDA.
America’s strong IP protections encourage investors to fund medical research despite the high costs and risks. After all, no one would pour billions of dollars into projects with a high failure rate without the ability to profit.
Strong IP protections have made the United States the world leader in drug development. Investment in the U.S. biopharmaceutical industry hit an all-time high of more than $70 billion in 2017. Nearly 4,000 new medicines are currently being developed in the United States, including more than 1,100 that will treat cancer.
But not every country values IP. Around the world, countries pursue two major practices that threaten drug development.
Many developed nations arbitrarily cap what they’re willing to pay companies for prescription drugs. In the United Kingdom, government bureaucrats unilaterally decide which drugs are worth spending money. If drug companies won’t meet their price point, they simply don’t cover them.
Meanwhile, developing nations tend to disregard U.S. patents through a process known as compulsory licensing. In very specific circumstances — often in the case of a national health emergency — governments can issue compulsory licenses to domestic firms, which allow them to produce copies of patented medicines.
Unfortunately, many countries take advantage of the compulsory licensing process. Even without a public health crisis, countries like India and Brazil allow firms to circumvent U.S. patents — just to save a few bucks on domestically produced knock-off drugs.
Each of these practices hinder U.S. firms’ ability to recoup their massive R&D losses and hamstring medical innovation. The United States is often the only country where drug makers can sell their drugs at a fair price.
But that may soon change, if certain politicians have their way. A recent Trump administration proposal would tie reimbursement for drugs covered by Medicare Part B to the prices paid in other developed countries, effectively importing price controls. Meanwhile, Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Texas, has introduced a bill that would empower the Department of Health and Human Services to grant compulsory licenses to American firms.
These policies would be as disastrous at home as they are abroad. If lawmakers really want to make drugs more affordable, they should take on foreign freeloaders — not imitate them.
Strengthening IP protections in trade agreements, like the recently negotiated United States-Mexico-Canada-Agreement, is a great place to start. USMCA affords companies that produce biologics — drugs made from living organisms — a longer period of time when competing drug companies cannot access their clinical trial data. This ensures that innovators have ample time to profit from their discoveries before rival firms can produce their own version of a therapy.
Lawmakers should also work to end price controls abroad. If we axed price controls now, by 2030 we’d see an additional 13 drugs developed each year. Similarly, discouraging compulsory licensing schemes would enable U.S. drug firms to expand to new markets and earn more money for future projects.
Thanks to medical advancement, the average American lives a decade longer than they did in 1950. Even so, more than 600,000 Americans will die from cancer this year. Every 65 seconds, someone in the United States develops Alzheimer’s disease.
The cure for any of these diseases could be just around the corner. Protecting intellectual property will help the patients of today get the medicines of tomorrow. About the Author Peter J.

Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg Asks For More Regulation — But Is He Genuine? – InsideSources,www.insidesources.com,Kate Patrick,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.insidesources.com/facebooks-mark-zuckerberg-asks-for-more-regulation-but-is-he-genuine/,"Tweet This
Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg penned a recent op-ed in The Washington Post asking regulators and lawmakers for “new rules” for the tech industry and identifying four ways for Facebook to better self-regulate. The op-ed comes on the heels of months of scandals over Facebook’s content moderation policies, use of user data, and other privacy abuses.
While Zuckerberg proposals address serious issues, multiple European and U.S.-based tech experts see his request for regulation as more of a calculated PR move to make sure that any future regulation benefits Facebook and solidifies Facebook as a dominant market player.
The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) frequently argues that Facebook often talks about embracing consumer-friendly policies in one breath, but then does something decidedly anti-consumer in the next .
Facebook knows regulators are extremely suspicious and critical of the company’s practices, which may explain why Facebook spent more than $12 million lobbying mostly members of Congress in 2018, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.
The op-ed highlights harmful content, election integrity, privacy and data portability as four important areas where Facebook can improve. Specifically, Zuckerberg said Facebook would create an “independent body” to which users can appeal content moderation decisions.
“This whole move is very rational for Mark Zuckerberg,” Roslyn Layton, a visiting tech scholar with the American Enterprise Institute (AEI) told InsideSources . “Trying to outsource the community standards makes sense so they don’t seem to be liable for the content they deliver, and distance Facebook from these claims that they’re politically biased. You could see this could work well, and from Facebook’s perspective, to demonstrate that they’re trying to do something about claims that they’re distributing malicious content, even though they aren’t technically liable under Section 230 [of the 1994 Communications Decency Act].”
At the same time, parts of Zuckerberg’s op-ed appeared disingenuous, like his statement that “Lawmakers often tell me we have too much power over speech, and frankly I agree.”
Zuckerberg’s critics note that Facebook’s business model revolves around the collection, packaging and dissemination of speech and information. The idea that Facebook has “too much power” in this area runs counter to Facebook’s fundamental operations.
Then there’s the opening about privacy and data portability. Zuckerberg calls for “harmonized” privacy rules, and describes GDPR as a good starting point for the U.S. to build its own federal privacy law.
Antonis Patrikios, a privacy and cybersecurity lawyer at London-based law firm Fieldfisher, told CNBC this is just Facebook acknowledging the reality that it must comply with GDPR, and compliance would be easier if the U.S. created a similar law.
The EFF wrote in a blog post Tuesday arguing that Facebook’s plan to take a more aggressive role in speech moderation should actually concern users, because it is a slippery slope to censorship.
“It is extremely difficult to define ‘harmful content,’ much less implement standards consistently and fairly for billions of users, across the entire spectrum of contemporary thought and belief,” Legal Director Corynne McSherry and Research Associate Gennie Gebhart write. “Mark Zuckerberg’s own company’s efforts to do so show how fraught that is. If individual companies, some with massive resources, can’t get this right , we have no reason to imagine that an independent body will do much better.”
Layton also told InsideSources that while data portability is a buzzword in privacy debates, it doesn’t really make sense for Facebook in practice, since there isn’t even a direct competitor to Facebook in terms of social media.
“The idea that you’re going to take your data and go to an alternative Facebook is pretty dead,” she said. “It’s no skin off Mark Zuckerberg’s back. This idea that we’re going to make your data portable and somehow creates competition to Facebook is kind of a joke. You can’t take your data to Amazon, or to an e-commerce site. Not all data is expungable to different types of platforms. It might not even be [expungable] to LinkedIn.”
Tom Lee, policy lead at Mapbox, a small business that provides mapping and navigation solutions to other tech companies like Facebook, testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee recently on data privacy, and also told InsideSources in an interview that data portability isn’t very feasible.
“Philosophically I love it,” he said, but Google and Facebook have offered businesses that work with them a data portability option for years. Lee said Mapbox doesn’t know what to do with it.
“Maybe people haven’t cracked the code (of what to do with it), which is something we could do,” he said. “I wish this worked, and it doesn’t seem like it does. There are potential risks that come with this. The thing that concerns me is how this could be used by identity thieves. We only collect anonymized data, we have no way to confirm individual data if someone came to us asking for it. There are some security risks associated with it, and it’s not clear it’s empirically worked in the past.”
Ultimately, Layton said, the most concerning thing about Zuckerberg’s op-ed is the fact that he called for more regulation in the first place.
“We need to be very cautious whenever large companies say please regulate us,” she said. “That’s how we got the Kingsbury Commitment of 1913 and the AT&T behemoth. When companies ask to be regulated, they only do it in their best interest. When you’re the CEO of your own company, you want to act in your best interest.”
That doesn’t mean we should pass this off as pro-consumer, she said. "
The “Moral Panic” of the Nicotine “Folk Devils” – InsideSources,www.insidesources.com,Michael Mcgrady,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.insidesources.com/the-moral-panic-of-the-nicotine-folk-devils/,"Tweet This South African criminologist Stanley Cohen authored the study Folk Devils and Moral Panics in 1972. Cohen examines the media controversies around the clashes between “mods” and “rockers,” two separate British youth subculture groups formed in the early 1960s. The study comments on a violent confrontation between the two groups at a beach in a Southern England seaside town in 1964. While there were cases of property damage and some non-serious injuries, there was no significant case of violence. However, newspapers and broadcast media outlets released sensationalist reports about the incident claiming that the events were far worse. Cohen analyzed media reports and concluded that the brawl that ensued was no different from the average fights between the two subculture groups from before the 1964 incident. In turn, the conclusion Cohen reached was that the media developed the idea that the two groups “rioted” as apart of a larger epidemic of violence. The truth of this case, nonetheless, revealed that the incidents were overly exaggerated. Cohen further concluded that the media, in the case of the brawl, went through three stages to create a panic. The first stage is “symbolization,” or the act of displaying the “folk devils” in a singular narrative with an oversimplified identity so that they are easily recognizable. The second stage is “exaggeration,” or the act of the media reporting distorted facts or fabricated information to fuel a “moral crusade” among the population. Then the final stage is “prediction,” or the act of media outlets leading the public to believe that the immoral actions of one folk devil or group of them will lead to more violence. Once the media has applied these three stages, the public reacts similarly in five stages of a “moral panic,” as “a condition, episode, person or group of persons emerges to become defined as a threat to societal values and interests,” according to Cohen. These five stages, while paraphrased for this analysis, follow this progression: Something or someone is defined as a threat to society and the social norms of the majority. Media outlets then depict this threat in familiar and recognizable symbols and messages. The depiction of this threat then rouses public outcry. Lawmakers, regulators, and other authorities respond to the public outcry. The moral panic and the resulting response from authorities causes social and economic changes to society. Cohen’s framework of moral panic can be used to analyze the case of outrage surrounding lower-risk nicotine products like e-cigarettes. These product categories face regulatory challenges all over the world thanks to a growing trend of fear and panic questioning the efficacy of these products and the harm minimization research behind them. The fears of vaping are associated with those regarding big tobacco companies targeting children with appealing advertising and marketing practices. This association of youth and smoking is what led the FDA to target the vaping industry for creating sweet flavors of liquid nicotine e-juices and pods. According to the agency and a plethora of one-sided research, the vaping industry targets children purposefully with fruity and dessert flavors. This couldn’t be further from the truth. For example, numbers that reveal youth vaping rates suggest a much lower calculation of prevalence and occurrence. Plus, scientific evidence shows that non-tobacco flavored e-juices and vapes are essential for smoking cessation. Under Cohen’s framework, the act of vaping, the people who manufacture, sell, and profit from these products, and the consumers who like to vape are now considered “folk devils” that threaten societal norms. This is owed to the exponential growth of fear associated with these products brought on by regulators and advocacy groups. In the realm of public health advocacy in the United States, nonprofit organizations such as the American Cancer Society and the American Lung Association hold an immense degree of influence over the federal government. Federal regulatory and research agencies like the FDA or Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) rely on the informed opinions of these organizations. Moreover, to further speak to that point, I have no dispute with the scientific prowess of these organizations due to their positive contributions to the fields of medicine and public health. Nonetheless, records are not always perfect. Both of these organizations, with others, are all active in advocating against alternative nicotine products that are safer than combustible cigarettes. Since these organizations work on similar talking points and for similar outcomes, funding and support are centralized and ultimately interlinked. Add the public health regulators of the federal, state, and local governments to the mix, these organizations act as funding structures that receive and dispense funds for research, political activity, and messaging regarding the harms of nicotine products. These nonprofits also are likely to receive “first dibs” on research grants to analyze specific topics the regulators may need to outsource. These nonprofits also provide grants to local governments through similar arrangements. In theory, these organizations could receive research monies to analyze the harms of vaping. Once this research is complete, more monies are brought in by grants from other nonprofits, government agencies, and donors to promote the one-sided “harm” message and participate in legislative and political activities to impact public policy. This promotion of a message of purely “harm” from the legislative and political spaces could come in the form of regulatory proposals that would ban certain types of lower-risk nicotine products or through political funding to support lawmakers who will vote for proposals or presidential appointees they endorse. Input the parameters of economist Bruce Yandle’s Bootlegger-Baptist phenomenon, arrangements like this could answer questions regarding the influence and source of fear that would attribute to a moral panic. The Bootlegger-Baptist theory is defined as the “observation that regulations are supported both by groups that want the ostensible purpose of the regulation and by groups that profit from undermining that purpose.” This is added to the analysis since these tobacco control groups and government agencies also have unlikely allies: pharmaceutical and some tobacco companies. Tobacco firms that have not diversified into e-cigarettes are likely to lose market share, and drug makers of medicinal nicotine products could lose customers due to the popular rise of a non-medical nicotine alternative. In turn, these groups will advocate for policies that would restrict competitive products forming a market cartel, of sorts. As noted with the application of Yandle’s Bootleggers-Baptists classification, the same apparatus of organizations are promoting negative messages about vaping. Any positive messaging, or disputing scientific evidence of the harm reduction benefits of these products, is quickly squashed in the media further adding to the moral panic. Based on what has been examined, Cohen’s stages of moral panic related to the case of vaping in the United States would look something like this: E-cigarettes, vapes, the industry behind them, and those who vape regularly are determined the “folk devils” by public health groups and the organizations involved in the “harm” messaging Bootleggers-Baptist coalition. FDA also contributes to this stage with the “youth epidemic” declaration. Media outlets quickly pick up on the “epidemic” declaration and a slew of headlines, investigative reports, scientific studies, and other academic work confirms the “harm” messaging. This happens without any mention of the potential benefits of e-cigarettes being a safer product than combustible cigarettes. Media outlets will also report to parents about youth vaping rates and how to tell if their child is “JUUL-ing” (the slang term used among youth who vape).
(a) The news outlets will go through the three media stages: Symbolization (the epidemic), exaggeration (“vaping is killing our children”), and prediction (“vaping is big tobacco’s newest ploy with more to come”). Public panic grows as parents start to create outrage groups to counter the epidemic. These groups gain the attention of the media, large tobacco control groups, lawmakers of all levels of government, and other frightened parents. Groups like parent grassroots movements then begin to petition their lawmakers and elected leaders to regulate these products because of the fear associated with nicotine and the declaration of an epidemic. Governments respond with policies that include more restrictive regulations. The outcries and the resulting responses from authorities to the moral panic left the society changed. The moral panic will subside, or it will continue surrounding a related issue or something entirely different.
Similar progressions under the Cohen framework can include the European Union’s ban on Swedish snus, Hong Kong’s ban on only e-cigarettes and not combustible cigarettes, and Australia’s criminalization of liquid nicotine. The main takeaway is that “moral panic” and knowing how to discharge it systematically is the common denominator to all instances of regulation and bans targeting lower-risk nicotine products.

At the Crossroads on Net Neutrality – InsideSources,www.insidesources.com,Patricia Ford,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.insidesources.com/at-the-crossroads-on-net-neutrality/,"Tweet This
The new Democratic House majority has a lot on its plate — including high priority items like protecting the Mueller investigation and getting the federal government reopened. But even in the crisis-a-day atmosphere of the Trump era, Democrats must also make room for the more mundane, but equally vital, work of legislative policymaking.
Given the realities of divided government, there won’t be too many opportunities for progressives to enact their priorities into law. On items like climate change, voting rights and health care, for example, it is likely that the new majority will be limited to making a record and developing proposals they can move on during the next Democratic administration. That makes it especially important to act aggressively in the few areas where bipartisan agreement is possible — and at the top of that list should be net neutrality regulation for the internet.
Net neutrality is the idea that all internet traffic should be treated equally and that no company should be allowed to block access to lawful websites, manipulate data for anticompetitive purposes, or censor or discriminate against anyone online. It’s like a Bill of Rights for internet users, keeping cyberspace open and free for all and protecting diverse voices and communities online.
Progressives have been fighting for net neutrality for years. Liberal lion Henry Waxman pushed for legislation on the subject almost a decade ago, but couldn’t persuade Republicans to come to the table. President Obama’s first FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski passed regulations implementing net neutrality in 2010, only to see them struck down by the courts that questioned the FCC’s legal power to enact these rules.
In response, President Obama’s second FCC chair, Tom Wheeler, tried a more controversial, hybrid approach, marrying net neutrality with a broader regulatory superstructure called “Title II” that was designed to address the court’s jurisdictional objection. The problem is, both Title II and a companion provision called “General Conduct Regulation” included in the Wheeler rules radically expanded the FCC’s reach into the internet ecosystem and undermined support for the core net neutrality protections to which they were married.
Title II and the General Conduct rule divided Democrats by going far beyond the traditional open internet protections and potentially harming rural areas and communities of color by slowing new deployment and upgrades for broadband. The Communications Workers of America and the NAACP questioned the effect on jobs and working people who depend on broadband. At the same time, such a far-reaching and unpredictable regulatory approach eliminated any possibility of Republican support.
Thus, it is no surprise that immediately after the 2016 elections, the Trump administration seized on these divisions and revoked the Wheeler rules.
Amid all this back and forth, however, something critical happened — a new bipartisan and cross-industry industry consensus formed to support the core provisions of net neutrality, including a ban on blocking websites, throttling traffic, or anticompetitive “paid prioritization.” Republicans and even industry players who once resisted net neutrality now recognize the need for basic legislation to ensure everyone has full and open access to the internet, and they reject the uncertainty and neck-snapping policy shifts that trying to solve the problem at the FCC has delivered.
For Democrats, this creates a major opportunity, a chance to prove that government can work and that progressive ideas can cross over into the mainstream and win bipartisan support. That would send a clarion message to voters that the new majority is capable, responsible and effective — that it can deliver where recent tea party Congresses repeatedly failed.
To get this done, however, will require smart, focused legislating by the new majority, which unfortunately is no sure thing. While there is a clear bipartisan support for the core, progressive version of net neutrality — the no blocking, no throttling, no prioritization rules championed by Henry Waxman and Julius Genachowski — that consensus falls apart when it comes to fringe add-ons like Title II public utility regulation or vague general conduct standards.
As a result, House leaders stand at the crossroads on net neutrality. They can pass a fringe, Christmas tree bill that lashes net neutrality to far more extreme ideas like Title II and general conduct regulation, staking out an extreme-pro-regulation position with a message bill that will be DOA in the Senate. Or they can pass a strong “clean” net neutrality bill featuring the core protections progressives have championed since the original Waxman legislation — a narrower but powerful bill that could win bipartisan support in both the House and Senate and serve as a landmark win validating the power and effectiveness of the new majority for all to see.
Some choices are difficult, but this one is both a political and policy no-brainer. It would bring a long-running issue to a successful conclusion for Democrats — protecting internet users and strengthening competition in the digital economy while delivering on a campaign promise despite the obstacle of divided government.
Democrats should move quickly on clean net neutrality at once. About the Author Patricia Ford is a former executive vice president of the Service Employees International Union. She wrote this for InsideSources.com. More from Inside Sources "
"Lara Trump: ""We Fully Expect to Win New Hampshire in 2020."" – InsideSources",www.insidesources.com,Michael Graham,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.insidesources.com/lara-trump-we-fully-expect-to-win-new-hampshire-in-2020/,"
A confident Lara Trump told NHJournal that the Trump 2020 campaign is already “laser-focused” on the Granite State and that her father-in-law has high expectations:
“We fully expect to win New Hampshire in 2020.”
“We only lost by 2,700 votes or so in 2016,” Trump told NHJournal. “New Hampshire is a very special place to us and I can tell you the president is laser-focused on winning here.” Lara Trump, President Trump’s campaign advisor and daughter-in-law, speaks to NHJournal’s Michael Graham before an appearance at an NHGOP fundraiser in Nashua on April 2, 2019.
Trump is both Trump’s daughter-in-law and a campaign advisor to the president who helped oversee his winning effort in her home state of North Carolina. She was in New Hampshire to headline a fundraiser for state GOP and its new pro-Trump chairman Steve Stepanek. She told the enthusiastic crowd that “you’re going to see a lot of us here in New Hampshire.
“The reality is we’ve already been working hard. For as, I’ll call it ‘grassroots,’ as we were in 2016 — I don’t want to call it ‘disorganized’– we are like a well-oiled machine now,” Trump said. “Brad Parscale, our campaign manager, is doing a great job. He’s got the data all lined up. It’s looking really good for us already.”
Trump and NHGOP chairman Stepanek both emphasized the new focus on data and voter targeting that, they say, has already begun in New Hampshire. “We have identified thousands of people here who did not vote for Donald Trump in 2016 who are now Trump supporters and are excited to vote for him in 2020,” Trump told NHJournal.
Those voters may exist, but they have yet to show up in the polls. In the latest NHJournal poll, Trump is underwater with Granite State voters, 36 percent approve/58 percent disapprove — similar to his 36-57 percent number in February’s Morning Consult poll. Trump’s disapproval in the Morning Consult’s monthly polling has been above 50 percent in New Hampshire for nearly two years, since May of 2017.
In addition , the anti-Trump #BlueWave of the 2018 midterm crashed hard across New Hampshire, with Democrats taking control of both chambers of the state legislature and holding both U.S. House seats.

Still, Lara Trump says, the campaign is committed to New Hampshire and believes they have identified the voters — in particular the non-college-educated, blue-collar voters — Trump needs to win. She also points to the state’s red-hot economy as another opportunity for Trump.
“Look at New Hampshire — the lowest unemployment in the entire country. Amazing, isn’t it? I think we win by asking people ‘has your life gotten better under a Trump presidency? Is a better or is it worse?’ And I think the vast majority of people here in New Hampshire are going to say ‘it’s better,'” Trump said.
“You might not love every tweet that Donald Trump tweets. You might not like him personally or thinks he’s got the greatest personality, but you better believe that people are happy with the fact that they have more money in their pockets. Their 401ks are going up, and the future for their kids looks brighter. They feel safer as a country. People really respond to that,” Trump said.
And she had a message for the ever-growing field of Democrats entering the 2020 primary:
“I still say save your money, don’t waste your money or time running against Donald Trump in 2020 because you’re not going to beat him. Save it until 2024,” Trump said.

Second Democratic Debate Set For July 30 and 31 in Detroit,www.uspresidentialelectionnews.com,Nate Ashworth,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.uspresidentialelectionnews.com/2019/04/second-democratic-debate-july-30-31-detroit/,"Second Democratic Debate Set For July 30 and 31 in Detroit The Motor City will be the backdrop for the second Democratic primary debate By 0
The Democratic debate schedule for 2020 is coming together as the first two debates are now on the calendar and candidates will begin jockeying for one of twenty debate slots at each event. Similar to the format that the first Democratic debate will feature, on NBC in June, the CNN debate will also split the field into two groups of ten set over two nights in primetime.
CNN has chosen Detroit, Michigan, to feature as the backdrop of the second debate. Michigan, as we witnessed in 2016, is an important state for Democrats and an important state for Donald Trump. Both parties will be making an emphasis to win the state in 2020. CNN Democratic Debate
Night 1: Tuesday, July 30, 2019 Night 2: Wednesday, July 31, 2019
The specific venue has yet to be announced and we don’t yet have information on moderators or the question and answer format. What we do know, however, is that the qualifications for this debate will mirror the first debate with twenty debate slots open to candidates.
By the time we get to June and July, the field will get a bit larger. Joe Biden, despite some recent trouble , is still set “full steam ahead” with the intention to launch a campaign in late April. Former Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe is also, reportedly , still considering joining the race.
The qualifications for attending one or both debates can appear to be cumbersome with different paths a candidate may take to the debate stage. Here’s a breakdown with further details direct from CNN :
Qualifying for the debates is based on a two-path system, determined by polling and grass-roots fundraising. The selection methodology will use the two measures in combination if more than 20 candidates qualify and the field needs to be narrowed down.
The debate will be over two days because the field is too big to fit on one stage. The Democratic National Committee will pick at random who ends up on each day. Up to 10 candidates will be onstage each night, so if there are more than 20 Democrats running, those who have not reached the threshold for grass-roots fundraising or polling will be excluded from the debate.
According to the debate guidelines, candidates “may qualify for the debate by registering at 1% or more support in three separate polls (either national polls or polls of the electorate in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and/or Nevada) publicly released between January 1, 2019, and 14 days prior to the date of the debate,” with “qualifying polls” coming from a DNC-approved list. That list includes polls from the Associated Press, ABC News, CBS News, CNN, Des Moines Register, Fox News, Las Vegas Review-Journal, Monmouth University, NBC News, New York Times, NPR, Quinnipiac University, Reuters, University of New Hampshire, Wall Street Journal, USA Today, Washington Post and Winthrop University.
The three polls used by candidates to qualify for the debate must be from three different organizations, or the same organization but of different geographical areas.
In addition to the polling criteria, candidates may qualify if they have received campaign contributions from at least 65,000 unique donors, and a minimum of 200 unique donors per state in at least 20 US states.
Most candidates will meet the polling and fundraising thresholds together since if you’re popular enough to register in national and state polls, you’re probably raising some money along the way.
However, by opening the debate stage to candidates who may be nothing more than a blip in most polls, we could see some dark horse names emerge closer to June that may be able to have a shot at attending based on the fundraising qualification alone.

DHS Sec. Nielsen Assures Tucker Carlson Eliminating Birthright Citizenship Is ‘On The Table’,www.newshounds.us,Ellen,04-03-2019,2019,4,http://www.newshounds.us/dhs_sec_nielsen_assures_tucker_carlson_eliminating_birthright_citizenship_on_the_table_040219,"DHS Sec. Nielsen Assures Tucker Carlson Eliminating Birthright Citizenship Is ‘On The Table’ 02, 2019 · Flag
In assuring Tucker Carlson’s white nationalist fans that she and Donald Trump are in solidarity with their hatred of immigrants, Department of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen casually, but with enthusiasm, tossed out the possibility that Donald Trump might issue an executive order overriding the centuries-old interpretation of the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution granting citizenship to anyone born here.
In a deep dive into the legal consequences of such an order, Vox correspondent Dara Lind noted in October that Trump was toying with the idea. The 14th Amendment, stating that “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside,” was ratified i n 1868 . Issuing such an order, Lind pointed out, would be a dare from Trump to the Supreme Court to stop him. She described such a maneuver as “potentially … the biggest constitutional power grab by a president in a century.”
But to Nielsen and white power champ Carlson, such a radical maneuver is no biggie. In fact, Carlson tried to push Nielsen into saying Trump would agree to it. He slipped it into his advocacy for an expansion of the E-Verify program to “punish” employers of undocumented immigrants. Nielsen’s nonchalant amenability was chilling. Of course, nobody mentioned that Trump’s own businesses have relied on such labor. CARLSON: It looks like Congress is not going to act because one party has a vested interest in changing the population and the other party is, in effect, controlled by people who want illegal immigration. So would there be a downside for the president to act unilaterally on that question or, for example, birthright citizenship? Would you be willing to draft an executive order eliminating birthright citizenship? NIELSEN: I think – you know, Tucker, I think the president’s been clear. All of that is on the table, including to close down the border. We have to stop this flow into our communities, we have to stop the drugs, we have to stop the smuggling, gangs. He’s very serious about it. So, yes! I think everything is on the table.

"Napolitano: Adam Schiff Is Right, Mueller Report Will Contain Evidence Of Trump Collusion",www.newshounds.us,Ellen,04-03-2019,2019,4,http://www.newshounds.us/napolitano_adam_schiff_right_mueller_report_evidence_trump_collusion_040219,"Napolitano: Adam Schiff Is Right, Mueller Report Will Contain Evidence Of Trump Collusion 02, 2019 · Flag
Fox News’ Senior Judicial Analyst Andrew Napolitano shot down the phony claims that the Mueller report has “completely exonerated” Trump and, while he was at it, Napolitano backed up GOP scapegoat Rep. Adam Schiff by acknowledging that the Mueller report will contain evidence of Trump collusion with Russia.
Napolitano also backed up my claim that so many others seem to have missed: that the Barr letter did not say Mueller found there had been no collusion. NAPOLITANO: If you read the attorney general’s letter carefully – he’s a very bright lawyer and he carefully chose his words. He said Bob Mueller was unable, quote, to establish a conspiracy . That means to prove the existence of the conspiracy beyond a reasonable doubt. He must have found some evidence of a conspiracy because if he found none, that would have made its way into Bill Barr’s letter. […] The other issue, of obstruction of justice, where Mueller sort of kicked the case upstairs, which prosecutors do when the target is a public official … there obviously is evidence of obstruction of justice and there is evidence of no obstruction of justice, and Mueller wanted Barr to make the judgment call which he did.
Actually, we do not know that Mueller “wanted Barr to make the judgment call” on obstruction of justice. Just as Barr cagily said the Mueller report “did not establish” a conspiracy, Barr wrote about obstruction of justice, “The Special Counsel's decision to describe the facts of his obstruction investigation without reaching any legal conclusions leaves it to the Attorney General to determine whether the conduct described in the report constitutes a crime.” Whether that was Mueller’s actual wish or Barr’s conclusion that Mueller’s indecision made it possible for Barr to make the decision is not clear.
Preet Bharara has theorized that Mueller wanted Congress to decide. The Daily Beast reported, “A source with direct knowledge of the investigation told The Daily Beast that it was their interpretation that ‘Mueller was making a case to Congress, who (unlike DOJ, in Mueller’s view) is empowered to weigh the lawfulness of a president’s conduct.’” If Mueller had wanted Barr to decide, you’d think Barr would have said so explicitly.
But wait, there’s more.
Napolitano also corroborated Schiff's claims. Democrat Schiff is now a target of Trumper Republicans weaponizing the report in order to demand his resignation as chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. NAPOLITANO: I think that Congressman Schiff is correct. In that report will be evidence of the existence of a conspiracy, not enough evidence to prove the existence beyond a reasonable doubt . In that report will be evidence of obstruction of justice, interfering with an FBI investigation for a personal gain but not enough evidence to prove it beyond a reasonable doubt. … If he has other sources, since he’s the chair of the House Intelligence Committee, he has to decide when and under what circumstances to reveal those sources.
The awful thing is that Fox is allowing its opinion hosts to ignore Napolitano and falsely declare Trump completely exonerated.

(LEX 18)– According to a letter from University of Kentucky President Eli Capilouto, commitments have been made and the student groups occupying the Main Building have left the building and ended the hunger strike.
Capilouto said that he met with the two different student-led groups for more than two hours Tuesday morning. In his letter, he said, ” I heard their brutally heartfelt and painfully honest stories about the challenges of being a student of color or need at our University. It was, as I told them, the toughest day I have had as a member of our community. My mind was further opened to their challenges and, frankly, to some of the shortcomings we have as an institution that aspires to be a community of belonging for everyone.”
The groups are the Black Student Advisory Council and the Basic Needs Campaign. The groups were occupying the Main Building of UK’s campus until their needs were met. The Basic Needs Campaign was also fasting until the needs were met.
The Black Student Advisory Council said they wanted their council to be added to all hiring search committees for the University’s senior-level administrative roles. They wanted to revise the William C. Parker Scholarship. They want to see the roles of college diversity offers standardized. They want the findings of a 2016 survey on campus climate to be released in full. The council also wanted to see the mural painted in Memorial Hall removed.
Capilouto said that UK will, ” immediately cover the mural and re-engage with a new committee to determine a long-term plan. Although efforts over the past two years to create a more complete context for the mural have been earnest and thoughtful, the artwork in Memorial Hall remains a touchstone of pain and hurt for many students of color.”
The Basic Needs Campaign wanted three demands met before ending their strike. Those demands were: 1.) Establish a physical Basic Needs Center. 2.) Establish a Basic Needs Fund. 3.) Establish a full-time Basic Needs staff person.
Capilouto said in his letter that UK will hire and train a full-time staff member to “coordinate and plan UK’s approach to basic needs, including food and housing insecurity. Additional resources for staffing and other needs will be added, if needed.” The letter also said that UK will consolidate its two emergency and assistance funds into a one-stop shop to better handle the requests related to food and housing insecurity and questions around basic needs.”"

This year’s roster will feature 14 Royals 2018 MLB Draft picks, including former Kentucky Wildcat Zach Haake. Along with five returning from the 2018 South Atlantic League Championship team, the 2019 season looks to be another competitive year in Lexington. “After last season’s South Atlantic League championship, we are thrilled to see returning players as well as some new faces,” said Legends President/CEO, Andy Shea. “It is also going to be special for Big Blue Nation to cheer on a former Wildcat on the mound at Whitaker Bank Ballpark. From college athlete to professional baseball player, we are excited for Lexington to watch Zach Haake on his path to the big leagues.” Haake pitched during the 2018 season for the University of Kentucky. He made 18 appearances as a Wildcat fanning 36 batters in his 34.0 innings of work. After he was drafted in the 6 th round of the 2018 MLB Draft, he began his professional career with the AZL Royals before being promoted to Rookie-level Idaho Falls. In his first professional season, he tossed 15.0 innings with a 1.76 ERA while striking out 14 opponents. Haake is the #23 prospect in the Kansas City Royals system, according to Baseball America. Left handed pitcher, Kris Bubic , joins the Legends as the #10 overall prospect in the Royals system, according to Baseball America.

Another south paw on the mound for Lexington this season is Austin Cox . Another college arm (Mercer) drafted in the 2 nd round of the 2018 MLB Draft, he had a great start to his professional career. In the Appalachian League with Burlington, Cox finished the season averaging almost 14 strikeouts per nine innings. Returning to Lexington is catcher, Chase Vallot . He spent 2015 and a part of 2016 with the Legends before being promoted to High-A Wilmington in 2017. During his time in a Legends uniform, he played 80 games in 2015 finishing with 13 doubles, three triples and 13 home runs. He improved those numbers in 2016. In 82 games he smashed 13 homers and 20 doubles with 44 RBI while boosting his batting average to .246.

Chicago Makes History With Election of New Mayor,townhall.com,Leah Barkoukis,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://townhall.com/tipsheet/leahbarkoukis/2019/04/03/chicagos-new-mayor-n2544185,"Chicago Makes History With Election of New Mayor Share Share Tweet
Chicago voters chose attorney Lori Lightfoot to be the city’s next mayor. The former federal prosecutor soundly defeated opponent Toni Preckwinkle 74 percent to Preckwinkle’s 26 percent, according to unofficial vote totals, making her the first African-American female to be elected mayor of Chicago. She is also the first openly gay individual to hold the post.
Lightfoot, who is a political newcomer, won support from every part of Chicago, a city whose residents clearly want to turn the tide against entrenched politicians, corruption and insider dealings, which have plagued the city for decades. The rejection of longtime political power broker Toni Preckwinkle, a former alderman and president of the Cook County Board, was thus representative of the anti-incumbent mood across the city, The Chicago Tribune reports.
Embarrassingly, voters issued such a rejection of Preckwinkle that she even lost her own Ward by 20 points.
In her victory speech, Lightfoot vowed to end the “cycle of corruption” in Chicago and said residents are beginning to see a ""city reborn.""
""Together we can and will make Chicago a place where your zip code doesn't determine your destiny,"" she said. ""We can and we will break this city's endless cycle of corruption and never again — never ever — allow politicians to profit from elected positions."" “When we started this journey 11 months ago, nobody gave us much of a chance. We were up against powerful interests, a powerful machine, and a powerful Mayor.” — Lori Lightfoot (@LightfootForChi) April 3, 2019 “But I remembered something Martin Luther King said when I was very young. Faith, he said, is taking the first step even when you can’t see the whole staircase.” — Lori Lightfoot (@LightfootForChi) April 3, 2019 “Together we can and will finally put the interests of our people—all of our people—ahead of the interests of a powerful few. Together we can and will make Chicago a place where your zipcode doesn’t determine your destiny.” — Lori Lightfoot (@LightfootForChi) April 3, 2019 “We can and we will break this city’s endless cycle of corruption, and never again allow politicians to profit from their elected positions.” — Lori Lightfoot (@LightfootForChi) April 3, 2019 “Out there tonight a lot of little girls and boys are watching us. And they’re seeing the beginning of something, well, a little bit different.They’re seeing a city reborn.” — Lori Lightfoot (@LightfootForChi) April 3, 2019
Lightfoot will be sworn in May 20."

German soccer giant Borussia Dortmund and major companies Daimler, Deutsche Bahn, Deutsche Bank and Volkswagen will each contribute €1m. ($1.12m.) to fund the expansion of Jerusalem’s Yad Vashem Holocaust History Museum.The donations, part of an initiative led by the German Friends of the Yad Vashem Association, will contribute to the establishment of the $50m. Shoah Heritage Campus, a 5,880 sq. m. center to house the museum’s rapidly increasing collection of artworks, artifacts and archives. Construction of the new center, which will also include a Holocaust exhibition suitable for families and children, is expected to commence in August and open in 2021. The cornerstone for the center will be laid on May 2, Israel’s Holocaust Remembrance Day.“Remembering, documenting, researching and teaching are the pillars on which Yad Vashem is founded,” said Borussia Dortmund CEO Hans-Joachim “Aki” Watzke, whose team currently leads the Bundesliga, the top professional German soccer league.“It is our honor and obligation to strengthen them. Future generations should know the suffering that has been inflicted on people by other human beings. We are committed to international understanding, tolerance and peaceful coexistence.”Yad Vashem’s collections include more than 210 million documents, 500,000 photographs, 131,000 survivor testimonies, 32,400 artifacts and 11,500 works of art related to the Holocaust.“For many years now, we have been providing educational programs for Borussia Dortmund fans, colleagues, partners and sponsors,” said Borussia Dortmund Managing Director Carsten Cramer.“Together with this strong network, we are making a lasting commitment to the memory of the Holocaust, as well as against modern day antisemitism.”The new facilities will be made accessible to researchers, educators and members of the public and some of the documents and artifacts will be made available for online access as well.The center will also enable the process of receiving, preserving and cataloging items collected by Yad Vashem to be streamlined.“The Nazis were determined not only to annihilate the Jewish people, but also to obliterate their identity, memory, culture and heritage,” said Yad Vashem Chairman Avner Shalev.“For many, all that remains are a treasured work of art, a personal artifact that survived with them, a photograph kept close to their person, a diary or a note,” Shalev said.“By preserving these precious items – that are of great importance not just to the Jewish people, but also to humanity as a whole – and revealing them to the public, they will act as the voice of the victims and the survivors, and serve as an everlasting memory.” Jeremy Sharon contributed to this report.

At age 70, most people are retired or contemplating retirement. But not in theater, where actors keep returning to the stage for as long as they can remember their lines. There are quite a number of octogenarians and nonagenarians amongst Israel’s thespians. Veteran actor Dubi Gal, who turned 70 last month, is making his debut in Yiddish theater in the current Yiddishpiel production, a musical comedy the name of which in English is Chasing Sweets, in Hebrew Ratzot el Hakugel (Running to the Pudding) and in Yiddish Varam und Geshmak (Warm and Tasty).Forgetting about the title, the translation by the multi-talented Lea Szlanger is very good, with a few amendments to suit the Yiddish idiom, and one possible grammatical error which may have been deliberate. Though set in the US prohibition era of the 1920s and 1930s, the dialogue includes many up-to-date concepts regarding acceptance of the other and the LGBTQ community. There’s also a sexy singer, who says “Me Too” in English because it has become a universal watchword, but then corrects herself and says in Yiddish “Ich oich.” But Ich is the subject – I. Me is the object, so the Yiddish for “Me too” should be “Mir oich.” But the character so convincingly played by Meital Nutick is not only a singer. She’s a floozy, who is not backward in coming forward and bears an uncanny resemblance to Marilyn Monroe. Director Yonatan Esterkin has created recognizable images on characters with other identities. The character played by Nutick, for instance, is called Fania, but with superb make-up and a blonde wig, a Monroe-esque figure, plus whispery vocals and a Yiddish rendition of ‘I want to be loved by you’, she could have easily been a Monroe understudy.By the same token, Gal singing a Yiddish version of There’s no Business like Show Business, proved his versatility with some fancy footwork reminiscent of Fred Astaire, and earned a spontaneous round of applause from the audience. The on-stage partnership between Nir Shafir and Yonatan Rozen, who play two New York Jewish musicians who often find themselves in the wrong place at the wrong time, evokes memories of Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau, while Israel Treistman, who has been a leading figure in Yiddishpiel productions for 30 years, plays Jewish gangster Dutch Schultz, but looks and sounds like Marlon Brando in The Godfather. In Yiddish, it all gets a different twist.Not for the first time has Esterkin introduced a b&w movie backdrop to add a sense of authenticity to what’s happening on stage. As scenes change, the actors wheel the sets on stage, and instantly use them to continue their roles.Gal appears as both narrator and actor. In the latter, he plays a New York policeman and a Hollywood film director.He also knows how to draw laughter at his own expense. Shorter than average in height, he tells the audience that his big dream when he was young was to be a basketball player, but he was rejected on the grounds that he did not have sufficient motivation, so he became a film director because in the movies. dreams can become real.The plot revolves around two musicians, Hershey (Rozen) and Mendel (Shafir), whose gigs took place in speakeasies that were raided by the cops, so the duo kept on finding themselves out of work, homeless and hungry.Eventually, by going into drag, they find themselves as members of an all-women’s band which has been signed up to appear in Florida. Thus begins a comedy of errors. To elaborate further would be a spoiler.Suffice to say that this is a high standard production, almost but not quite devoid of traditional Yiddish slapstick. The actors obviously enjoy what they’re doing, and this feeling conveys itself to the audience whose ongoing appreciation is expressed in roars of laughter and applause.At a gala performance this week for the Friends of Yiddishpiel, the only song from the regular Yiddish repertoire was in the grand finale when al the cast came together to sing Bei mir bist du shein with the audience joining in with gusto.An obviously emotional Gal who was thrilled with the way he had been received, called everyone remotely associated with the production to join him on stage. He said that it was a joy to return to his roots –“not to mamaloshen but to Bobba loshen.” His parents, who regarded themselves as pioneers when they came to the Land of Israel, spoke Hebrew, but his grandmother spoke to him in Yiddish.When Yiddishpiel director Sassi Keshet called him and urged him to appear in a production, he had reservations, having never previously acted on the Yiddish stage, but was cajoled by both Keshet and Yiddishpiel CEO Zelig Rabinovich, and he was glad that they had prevailed.“Your reaction warmed my heart,” he told the audience.Yiddishpiel goes on tour around the country and performances of this production are scheduled to keep going until the end of May. Till then, performances will take place in Petah Tikva, Rishon Lezion, Beersheba, Ashdod, Tel Aviv, Bat Yam, Haifa and Ramat Gan.For more info see http://www.yiddishpiel.co.il/en/

RIYADH - Nearly a dozen prominent Saudi women activists returned to court on Wednesday to face charges related to their human rights work and contacts with foreign journalists and diplomats, in a case that has intensified Western criticism of a key Mideast ally.Three of the women - blogger Eman al-Nafjan, academic Aziza al-Yousef and conservative preacher Ruqayya al-Mohareb - were temporarily released last week on the condition that they attend future sessions. They were seen entering the courthouse on Wednesday. Riyadh's criminal court had been expected to rule earlier this week on requests for temporary releases for the other women, but sources familiar with the case said the decision had been postponed until Wednesday's hearing. The reason was unclear.Western diplomats and media, including Reuters, have been denied entry to the hearings.The trial, now in its third session, has drawn global attention to the kingdom's rights record, which was already in the spotlight following the murder last year of journalist Jamal Khashoggi inside the kingdom's consulate in Istanbul.Three dozen countries, including all 28 EU members, Canada and Australia, have called on Riyadh to free the activists. British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt and US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo raised the issue during recent visits.The temporary releases and the cases' transfer from a high-security terrorism court at the last minute without explanation are seen as possibly signaling a more lenient handling of the case after months of lobbying by Western governments.Yet it remains to be seen if Riyadh will bend to international pressure or pursue harsh sentences in a case critics say has revealed the limits of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's promises to modernize Saudi Arabia.The activists were detained weeks before a ban on women driving cars in the conservative kingdom was lifted last June.At least five men were detained in the same sweep, though none of them are currently on trial. Rights groups say two of them have been released, but the status of the others is unclear.Some of the women on trial told the court last week they had been subjected to torture in detention, including electric shocks, flogging, and sexual assault. The Saudi public prosecutor previously denied those accusations.Dozens of other activists, intellectuals and clerics have been arrested separately in the past two years in an apparent bid to stamp out opposition to the government.

Israel falls near the bottom of the developed world as a place for conducting business, according to studies by the World Bank, and one of the reasons is the regulatory burden in the country.In a panel Wednesday at The Jerusalem Post Elections Conference in Tel Aviv, Blue and White Party candidate Zvi Hauser - a former secretary general - Aharon Fogel, former director general of the Ministry of Finance; and Dr. Michael Sarel, a senior fellow at Kohelet Forum, participated in a panel on the connection between regulation and doing business in Israel. “In the present era, there is a lack of trust between the legal, business and governmental establishments,” said Hauser. “No one believes in anyone, so it is impossible to develop a state.” As such, he explained, the country overregulates and business people try to circumvent these regulations - two actions that ultimately lead to increasing distrust.“The price [of overregulation] is terrible,” said Hauser.He said that regulation always takes time, on the one hand, but that the Jewish state has created such a complex regulatory web that some of the country’s best innovation and talent chooses to establish their businesses abroad just to avoid Israeli bureaucracy. The citizens therefore cannot benefit from this innovation.“While in the 21st century processes are accelerating, the private market is innovating and advancing, the State is moving backwards,” Hauser said. “Our bureaucratic wheels work at a different pace.""Fogel noted that while many boast the strength of the Israeli economy, it could be a lot better.“It’s good despite the political echelon and because of people who are creative and who do wonderful things,” Fogel said. “But the government should enable us to do more, should create conditions to make that happen.”He said Israelis pay very high takes - as much as 60% - which encourages black market activity. He said tax cuts would encourages greater entrepreneurship“Encourage tax-exempt entrepreneurship or tax relief only if the entrepreneur succeeds, there is no risk to the state,” he said.Relatedly, Sarel said he believes that unions are too empowered and that this power creates an imbalance between workers and consumers and entrepreneurs.“This power hinders the economy and all workers in general,” he said. “When a business owner is afraid to act, it affects decisions” across many aspects of the business.So, does overregulation.“I saw a factory in the South whose ceiling was 2 centimeters too low to meet fire regulations and no one in the system had the authority to say the factory could continue to operate with its ceiling like this or while it was making the necessary changes,” Sarel said. “So, he had to put 150 families on hold and it ultimately took three years, and those families lost their jobs and the factory closed.”Solid changes take long-term planning and collective adoption, Sarel said.“There are no magic tricks,” he said.

JERUSALEM- Israel's economy has barely featured in the run-up to next week's general election, yet the central bank and many economists warn the new government will need to cut spending and raise taxes to rein in a growing budget deficit.The pre-election debate has been dominated by security issues and the possible indictments facing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in corruption cases. Opinion polls ahead of the April 9 vote suggest a close race between the premier's right-wing Likud party and the centrist Blue and White party. Netanyahu, who has been in office for a decade, has long touted the economic successes of Israel. Indeed growth is robust, unemployment is low, the Israeli high-tech sector is second only to Silicon Valley globally and foreign investment is strong.However he and his finance minister, Moshe Kahlon, have cut taxes while spending generously on policies like pay rises for police and subsidies for kindergartens in recent years, leading to a widening budget deficit.Now the Bank of Israel and many economists warn that the economy is set to slow as a result of weaker global growth, which would hit Israeli exports. The central bank, which has started a gradual process of raising interest rates, said the next government would have to cut spending in coming months as well as raise some taxes.Analysts expect the spending reductions and tax hikes to reach 10-12 billion shekels ($2.8-$3.3 billion) to narrow this year's budget gap.""The government that will be chosen will have to make fiscal adjustments,"" said Bank of Israel Governor Amir Yaron. He added these steps should be taken when the economy was in good shape as they would be tougher to implement if conditions worsened.""The grey clouds on the horizon should not be ignored,"" he said on Sunday, referring to reductions in global growth forecasts.A higher budget deficit and public debt reduce the ability of a country to withstand economic shocks, like another financial crisis, and can also threaten its credit rating and borrowing costs.Ratings agencies Fitch and S&P said Israel was not at risk of a downgrade in the near term, but also stressed the next government would have to take steps to rein in the deficit.The country's budget deficit is projected by analysts to rise to close to 4 percent of gross domestic product this year - above a target of 2.9 percent. The deficit was 2.9 percent of GDP in 2018, widening to 3.5 percent in the 12 months to February this year.The central bank believes the state must stick to a deficit target of 2.5 percent of GDP. At 3 percent, the public debt burden would rise from a current level of 61 percent to 65 percent of GDP by 2025, or as much as 75 percent should the economy worsen, Yaron warned.The finance ministry, which expects a budget deficit of at least 3.5 percent this year, says the situation is being blown out of proportion, noting Israel is one of the only Western countries to have reduced its debt ratio over the past decade.""There is a gap of 6 billion shekels that we need to close in a budget of 400 billion shekels ... It's not a big problem and certainly not a catastrophe,"" Shai Babad, the ministry's director general, told Reuters. ""We are monitoring it. When you have 37.8 Celsius fever you don't go to surgery.""By comparison, the U.S. deficit is expected to be 5 percent of GDP in 2019, France's deficit 2.8 percent, Spain's 2.3 percent, Britain's 1.7 percent and Germany's 1.5 percent, according to International Monetary Fund estimates. 'PUT BRAKES ON' The next Israeli government is likely to be in place by late May.Leader Capital Markets Chief Economist Jonathan Katz said the new administration could implement so-called fiscal consolidation measures in two stages - in the middle of this year and then in early 2020.""I don't think they will necessarily have to cut immediately the budget by 12 billion shekels and raise taxes, to put the brakes on right away and sharply. I think they have the leeway to do it in two stages,"" he said.""The budget should have been balanced by 2017 when you are at full employment, and this would allow you fiscal tools to expand spending during a slowdown.""Finance ministry chief Babad said updated forecasts for state income and expenses would be available in June, when the ministry would determine if action was needed. The 2020 state budget is expected to be ready for a cabinet vote by early August, he added.He said if there was an issue with Israel's fiscal policies, global rating agencies would be more concerned.Last week, Fitch affirmed its sovereign debt rating of 'A+' with a 'stable' outlook, but believes the new government must take steps to narrow the budget deficit.Similarly, Standard & Poor's last year raised its rating to 'AA-' from 'A+', also with a stable outlook. It affirmed the rating in February.""If the fiscal slippage or relaxation of fiscal performance were to be repeated or happen consistently, we might conclude that there is a shift in the government's fiscal stance,"" said Karen Vartapetov, a sovereign ratings director at S&P.""The next government, whatever it might be, will have to take some difficult decisions including potential tax hikes or cost controls. This is for sure.""

Baltimore Mayor Suspected For Shady Book Sales To City Contractors,thefederalist.com,Ellie Bufkin,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/03/baltimore-mayor-hot-water-shady-childrens-book-sales-city-contractors/,"April 3, 2019 By Ellie Bufkin
In recent years, Baltimore, Maryland has become more famous for scandal and public corruption than it ever was for Chesapeake crabs and Berger cookies. Sadly, this week marks a new low for Charm City as their mayor, Catherine Pugh, has become embroiled in a scandal from which she is unlikely to recover, possibly facing criminal charges.
Last week, the mayor acknowledged a “ regrettable mistake ” in taking $500,000 from the University of Maryland Medical Systems (UMMS) for her series of children’s books, “Healthy Holly.” Pugh sat on the board of UMMS but resigned once news of the payment became public. In a press conference, she stated that every book she had been paid for did reach their intended destination of Baltimore public schools, even providing shipping receipts and statements to the effect. UMMS receives significant public funding .
In only a few days, however, the regrettable mistake exploded into full-blown scandal when The Baltimore Sun reported that health conglomerate Kaiser Permanente paid Pugh about $115,000 for 20,000 of her “Healthy Holly” books. These purchases were all made during a period when Kaiser Permanente was bidding for a lucrative contract to insure city employees. Additionally, nonprofit Associated Black Charities paid Pugh’s company a further $80,000 after collecting money from several health insurance providers for copies of the books.
When Kaiser Permanente’s contract bid came before the Board of Estimates, she did not recuse herself. She voted in favor of it .
Attorneys for Pugh confirmed that she received payment from UMMS but were unable to answer questions about the Kaiser Permanente payments. The mayor took a leave of absence on Monday, claiming illness.
The scandal has devolved to such an unbelievable level of deceit and wrongdoing that those who remember the HBO drama “The Wire” may find Pugh’s actions eerily similar to criminal politician Clay Davis. However, this scandal would never have made it to an episode of the award-winning show. Creator and Baltimore native David Simon was none too impressed with his mayor’s behavior. If this Baltimore scandal came out of my shop, the writer’s room would be fired for being devoid of wit and nuance. This mayor needs to resign. And get with her lawyers. And read the U.S. code. This is straight-up extortion, bribery and bid-rigging. https://t.co/dAniRngoVa
— David Simon (@AoDespair) April 1, 2019
As a Baltimore native, I agree the city deserves far better.
While Pugh is confident that the shipment of nearly 60,000 of the books went directly to the Baltimore public school center, the schools are less certain, though they admit to being unable to track what has gone in and out of their warehouses.
Several members of Pugh’s own party have asked for her resignation. Republican Gov. Larry Hogan has asked the state prosecutor to launch an investigation into the book sales.
In a statement last week, Pugh claims that while she will continue to write children’s books and is designing children’s clothes. It seems she will have plenty of time to pursue both.

Donald Trump panics at the prospect of the Mueller report surfacing - Palmer Report,www.palmerreport.com,Bill Palmer,04-02-2019,2019,4,https://www.palmerreport.com/analysis/panic-mueller-report-surface-prospect-trump/17137/,"Donald Trump panics at the prospect of the Mueller report surfacing Bill Palmer | 10:55 pm EDT April 2, 2019 Line
Just last week, back when he was still trying to convince us (and himself) that he’d been “exonerated” across the board, Donald Trump repeatedly stated that he was in favor of the full Robert Mueller report being released to Congress and the public. Now, suddenly and tellingly, Trump is singing a very different tune in that regard.
The House Judiciary Committee is set to vote on Wednesday morning to authorize Chairman Jerry Nadler to issue as many subpoenas as he wants, in the name of forcing the Mueller report to become public. By Donald Trump’s own logic, he should be fine with this, right? After all, he keeps insisting that the report is good news for him. Except now he’s suddenly very offended at the idea that anyone would want to see the entire report.
Trump said this of Nadler this morning: “With the NO COLLUSION Mueller Report, which the Dems hate, he wants it all. NOTHING WILL EVER SATISFY THEM!” Wait, so it’s wrong for the House Democrats and the public to want to see the entire report? But Trump wasn’t done changing his story: “There is no amount of testimony or document production that can satisfy Jerry Nadler or Shifty Adam Schiff. It is now time to focus exclusively on properly running our great Country!”
Actually, there is something that can satisfy us all: give us the entire Mueller report, with no edits, no redactions, no more games, and let us all decide for ourselves what to make of it. But Donald Trump knows he can’t do that, because he knows what all he’s done wrong, and he fears Robert Mueller uncovered much or all of it, and he knows his presidency could effectively be over the minute the Mueller report surfaces. Now that House Democrats are about to subpoena everyone and everything in order to obtain the report, no wonder Trump is panicking. "

DHS Chief Kirstjen Nielsen Hints Donald Trump May Close Border: 'He's Very Serious About It',www.newsweek.com,Dan Cancian,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-us-mexico-wall-kirstjen-nielsen-border-wall-1384455,"Kirstjen Nielsen, the secretary of homeland security, claims President Donald Trump is “very serious” about closing the border with Mexico.
Speaking on Fox News' Tucker Carlson Tonight show on Tuesday night, Nielsen said the U.S. was facing one of its worst crises in a decade as the administration battles with Congress to address the issue of immigration.
Last week, Trump suggested that closing the border with Mexico would be a “profit-making operation,” which many interpreted as a reference to the United States' trade deficit with its southern neighbor.
Nielsen indicated the possibility of closing the border was very real and was just one of the measures the Trump administration was considering to stem the flow of illegal immigrants.
“I think the president has been clear and all of that is on the table, including closing the border,” she said. “We have to stop the drugs, we have to stop the smuggling and trafficking. I don’t think the president could be any clearer in his position. He will take every action within his authority to stop this flow.”
Asked by Carlson whether Trump would consider eliminating birthright citizenship, Nielsen suggested the president had not ruled out that particular option either.
The Fox News host then pointed out that while a promise to tackle immigration was central to Trump’s campaign, she noted that “things seem less under control now” than before the president was elected.
When Carlson inquired about the number of people living illegally in the U.S., suggesting it could be as high as 22 million, Nielsen admitted the department did not have a clear picture.
“We don’t know, and part of that is because we do not have the wall that the president continues to advocate for,” she said. “We cannot in every circumstance tell you who is crossing the border.”
The homeland security chief then expanded on the issue, suggesting that having millions of people in the U.S. illegally was one of the worst crises the country has faced in a decade.
“The security aspects of this and the humanitarian aspects of this have got to be addressed,” she said. “This is at the very top of our list at DHS.”
Nielsen added that the department was combining resources from different law enforcement agencies in a bid to tackle the immigration issue, but she insisted that Congress had to help the government.
Carlson then quizzed Nielsen over whether Trump would be prepared to send the military to the border with Mexico, given the magnitude of the crisis.
Nielson suggested the government was “looking into that” and had sent a request to the Department of Defense. “He has full authority to defend our country,” she said. “That’s what he is moving to do. His statements about closing the border are a perfect example. We will take all action to do this. It’s on the table.”
Congress, Nielsen suggested, was “politically blinded” when it came to supporting the Trump administration's pledge to address the immigration issue.
“I don’t believe they don’t see it or they don’t understand it, they are just willfully choosing to ignore it,” she said.

Nuking Minority Rights In The Senate Is A Terrible Idea,thefederalist.com,Rachel Bovard,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/03/nuking-minority-rights-senate-terrible-idea/,"By Rachel Bovard April 3, 2019
Ed Whelan of National Review on Monday published a two-part rebuttal to my argument against the Senate’s effort to nuke their post-cloture 30-hour rule. The Senate began that very process Tuesday.
Part one of Whelan’s argument focuses exclusively on whether the Senate has the right to change its rules, or, as it is about to do, create a precedent in violation of those rules. I refer you to Twitter for the bulk of my rebuttal to part one. Suffice to say, nowhere in my original piece do I dispute the notion that the Constitution grants the Senate affirmative authority over its rules. The issue is not one of constitutionality, but rather, one of prudence.
I assert that it is unwise, for the reasons outlined in my original piece and in the Twitter thread . Whelan seems to suggest that because it is constitutional it, therefore, should be done. He also uses procedural examples from Senate expert Marty Gold, which basically represent an unclear and apples-to-oranges comparison in this case. But again, I refer you to the thread, which remains un-rebutted by Whelan.
But I’d like to focus my rebuttal to Whelan on the second part of his argument , which is closer to the substance of my case.
Whelan and I come at this from two fundamentally different viewpoints. Whelan is concerned with outcomes—in this instance, confirming as many judicial nominations as possible. I am concerned with long-term consequences; chief among them the Senate’s ability to protect the rights of those with minority viewpoints, and to act as a check on an unruly majority and an overly empowered executive.
I will take each of his assertions one at a time.
1. A vote cannot be called during the post-cloture 30 hours because, after speaking, each senator returns the Senate to a quorum call, which prevents the presiding officer from calling a vote.
This is a fundamental misunderstanding of how the Senate operates. Quorum calls technically exist to summon senators to the floor to address pending business. Recall the scene in Frank Capra’s “Mr. Smith Goes to Washington” where Sen. Jefferson Smith, frustrated that nobody is in the chamber to hear his speech, asks for a quorum call to force all senators to return to the chamber.
The modern Senate uses quorum calls to filibuster action on the Senate floor. To understand how this works, consider there are only three things that happen on the Senate floor: a speech, a quorum call, and a vote. Thus, when senators finish speaking, traditionally they “suggest the absence of a quorum” to return the Senate to stasis. If they did not, and no other senator is seeking recognition, the Senate immediately could move a vote on the pending business. (I’ve written more about quorum calls here .)
As to Whelan’s specific objection, it is easily overcome. The last senator to speak simply does not return the Senate to a quorum call. The majority leader then summons a live quorum to the floor and moves to the vote. (I’ve also written more about how this would work here .)
Moreover, there is the technical point that, post-cloture, only one quorum call is in order. Further quorum calls are considered dilatory. So, Whelan’s point that each senator returning the Senate to a quorum call blocks the Senate moving to a vote is technically incorrect on that point as well.
Hence, when there are no longer any senators seeking recognition, the Leader calls a live quorum. Senators gather. A vote is held.
2. If my argument is that senators are lazy, then I should support the nuclear option to reduce 30 hours of debate to two.
This is only true if a) I am exclusively concerned with outcomes, that is, confirming as many judges as is humanly possible (I’m not; I’m more concerned with consequences) and b) if I thought reducing hours of debate would actually speed up confirmation (I don’t).
Senators are indeed lazy, as I lay out in my original piece . The fact that they’d rather diminish the integrity of the Senate’s rules by nuking them instead of using them is a case in point.
However, the proposed rules change, Senate Resolution 50 would simply gag senators without speeding anything up. Its practical effect will be to codify the Senate’s laziness.
Whelan claims that the Senate resolution would speed up confirmations for “most” nominations by reducing the 30 hours to two hours. But the proposal leaves the 30 hours in place for Supreme Court nominations, circuit court judges, and nominees to boards like the Federal Reserve. The proposal then divides that time equally between the majority and the minority (each get 15 hours).
Ironically, this actually locks in longer consideration of these nominees than currently exists. Under existing rules, 15 hours of debate takes 15 different senators (and fewer than 15 if not enough senators show up to debate). Under Senate Resolution 50, all 15 hours have to run, regardless of who shows up to debate, assuming the Democrats do not yield back time (and, after the GOP goes nuclear, why would they?).
In other words, existing rules allow the 30 hours to be shortened if properly exercised. The 30 hours under existing rules represent a ceiling. Senate Resolution 50, for the nominations that are exempt from the rules change, actually locks in 30 hours as the floor, meaning they must be run regardless of whether they are even used.
There is also the small fact that the Senate still only works 2.5 days a week, and that is unlikely to change, regardless of what the Senate does to its rules. (The 2.5-day work week may be the one de facto rule of the Senate that is untouchable.)
3. Whelan cannot “make heads or tails” of my argument that Trump’s political appointees will not be as easily confirmed.
Senate Resolution 50 shortens the 30 hours for district judges and sub-Cabinet nominations. Most of these confirmations are processed right now in larger packages, by unanimous consent. Last Congress, the Senate confirmed 714 individual nominations (this number excludes military promotions), of which 182 were done by roll call votes. Critically, 532 nominations were confirmed by voice vote or unanimous consent.
That is, the Senate last Congress confirmed most of their nominees via consent. If the 30 hours are nuked, it seems reasonable to conclude that Democrats will withhold any consent for these nominations, requiring each of them to processed individually on the floor.
As Whelan points out, there are thousands of nominees, particularly at the lower level. Without these giant consent packages, Senate Republicans would need to prioritize nominations for floor time. If given the option between a Trump political appointee who will serve for the next two years, or a judge who will have a lifetime appointment, it seems obvious which one is going to get floor time, and which one is not.
4. Finally, the legislative filibuster. I argue that normalizing nuclear behavior on the judicial filibuster puts the legislative filibuster at risk. Whelan calls this “speculative” and asserts that judicial filibusters and legislative filibusters are totally separate and the state of one does not, and should not, impact the state of the other.
This gets to the crux of our disagreement. Whelan is concerned solely with outcomes—in this case, confirming as many judicial nominees as possible. He does not appear to give any consideration to what happens to minority rights in the Senate as a result.
I would argue that the last point—the state of minority rights in the Senate—is the essential one. This is especially true for conservatives, of which Whelan is one. Conservatives are always in the minority, even when Republicans are in the majority.
The Senate is distinct from the House in that its rules empower a robust minority. Dissent in the Senate—be it from the opposing party, or one or two members who disagree with their majority—is a high bar to overcome in the upper chamber. The Framers designed it that way, as a means of checking a rowdy majority (otherwise known as the House) and standing up against too powerful an executive.
Republicans have used these rights just as much as Democrats. Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) withheld consent on Department of Justice nominees to force a conversation with Attorney General Jeff Sessions over marijuana laws. Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) used his rights to make a lonely, but ultimately successful, quest to oppose the nomination of Chai Feldblum to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
Under the contemplated rules change, most of Gardner’s nominees would be confirmed after two hours. Lee could have been blocked from speaking on the Feldblum nomination if the majority leader yielded back all time (Senate Resolution 50 allows the leaders to control the post-cloture debate time).
Minority rights are central to the Senate regardless of who is in power. But, for Republicans, minority rights become even more important when they are in the minority. Again, conservatives are always in the minority.
Ultimately, the issue we should be concerned with here is less about the judicial or legislative filibuster. It’s more about using nuclear tactics on Senate rules. Once the Senate normalizes going nuclear on its rules as a practice, this will then naturally applied to rules of any kind, including rules that govern legislation.
It’s already happening. This isn’t a perfectly correlated example, but it’s one worth noting. Last month, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) created a new precedent on the War Powers Act to prevent Republican senators from offering amendments. In this particular instance, McConnell used the opening of an ambiguous statute to gag the amendment process. In other words, he created a precedent to further constrain the Senate as it relates to the legislative process.
The more the Senate normalizes a practice of nuking every rule in its path, or creating a precedent to curtail legislative options, it’s only a matter of time before the Senate’s rules become even more meaningless as the Senate descends to a pseudo-majoritarian version of the House. So much for the “world’s greatest deliberative body.”

"Mon public losing trust in the NCA, says NMSP Mon News Agency",monnews.org,,04-03-2019,2019,4,http://monnews.org/2019/02/28/mon-public-losing-trust-in-the-nca-says-nmsp/,"Environmentalists call for community-driven river investment projects at the International Day of Action for Rivers 2 weeks ago
The Mon community’s trust in the nationwide ceasefire agreement (NCA) is wavering, according to a New Mon State Party (NMSP) statement given at a Mon National Day celebration last Wednesday. Despite the NCA, the NMSP still faces political barriers when it comes to secession and one-party Tatmadaw (Myanmar Army) rule. In addition, the fourth peace conference (21st Century Panglon Conference) is not being held on schedule.
At the 72nd Mon National Day celebrations held in the armed group’s liberated area on Wednesday, February 20, the NMSP expressed their hope of establishing a genuine federal union with equal rights, democracy, and self-determination. The NMSP had signed the NCA with these hopes in mind. However, it has been one year since the signing of the NCA, and the Tatmadaw has not turned over the NMSP troop bases, which the Tatmadaw had previously seized. In addition, the NMSP has yet to participate in the Joint Ceasefire-Monitoring Committee (JMC) of Mon State, Karen State, and Tanintharyi Region, respectively.
The NMSP is not satisfied with talks with the Tatmadaw. “The other day, we had an informal meeting in Naypyitaw. At the meeting, we informed the respective [Tatmadaw] officials. We are only allowed one representative in the JMC-U (Union-level of the JMC), and we could only participate in Mon State’s JMC-S (State-level of the JMC). So, because NMSP is not allowed to join the talks of the Karen State-level JMC and Tanintharyi Region-level JMC, NMSP has decided not to join the Mon State-level JMC,” said NMSP General Secretary Nai Aung Min at the press conference on Wednesday (February 20).

The NMSP’s 72nd Mon National Day celebration was held near the Thai-Burma border in the NMPS-controlled village of Palaedonpaik in the Three Pagodas Pass area. The event included a NMSP parade. A press conference was held after the celebration.
In addition to the NMSP Mon National Day celebration on the Thai-Burma border, a Central Mon National Day celebration was held in the compound of Shwe Mawdaw Pagoda in Bago Capital. The Union Peace Dialogue Joint Committee Chairwoman and State Counselor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi sent a letter that was read at the celebration. The letter stated her firm belief that although there are challenges on the road to national reconciliation, they will be overcome by the unity of Pyitaungsu (union) sons and daughters (citizens).

Nai Thet Lwin, the Union Minister of Ethnic Affairs, read the letter on behalf on Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, “When heading to the future federal democracy, I proudly send this letter and I hope the ethnic Mon people will stand together, hand [in hand] with the other ethnic brothers/sisters, and will cooperatively participate actively.”
The letter continued that today in the minds of ethnic Mon people, the dawn of the peace is covering the entire Mon State with brightness and warmth.
Celebrations of the 72nd Mon National Day were also in Yangon, Mawlamyine, Mudon, and other Mon villages, as well as in foreign countries, including Thailand.
Mon National Day marks the day the two Mon princesses, Samala and Vimala, established the Mon Kingdom Hongsarwatoi (Bago) on the 1st Waning of Tabodwe (Maik month in Mon) in the year 1116 of the Buddhist Era. Share this:"

“I’ve known Walter for years. He’s the right person at a critical time for Tampa.” Share this: Former gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum is endorsing Walter Smith II for Tampa City Council. Smith posted an audio file of Gillum’s endorsement on Facebook Tuesday morning. “I’ve known Walter for years. He’s the right person at a critical time for Tampa,” Gillum said. http://floridapolitics.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/I-am-absolutely-honored-to-have-recieved-the-endorsement-of-Mayor-Andrew-Gill....mp4 Smith is running for the District 1 seat being vacated by Mike Suarez who is leaving office due to term limits. Smith is running against hairdresser and long-time Tampa civic activist Joe Citro . The endorsement is huge for Smith in a citywide election where voters went soundly for Gillum last year. Smith won a spot in the runoff with a second place finish March 5 but lagged 12 points behind Citro . He’s also at a funding disadvantage. Smith has raised less than $9,000 while Citro has brought in more than $36,000. “Like many of us I’ve been inspired by Mayor Gillum’s passion for the state of Florida, from his time as the Mayor of Tallahassee, his campaign for the governorship of Florida and his continued efforts to make every vote count in Florida,” Smith wrote on Facebook of the endorsement. “Andrew and I are passionate about the same thing: a Florida and Tampa that works for everyone, where everyone gets the chance to succeed. This campaign is about the people of Tampa, and we can’t do it without you, whether it’s volunteering, making a donation and most importantly your vote.” Following his defeat against now-Governor Ron DeSantis last November, Gillum was rumored to be considering a presidential run or for a possible running mate for another candidate. Instead, he announced last month he would run the group Bring It Home Florida , a massive get out the vote effort aimed at flipping Florida blue in future elections. In his endorsement for Smith, Gillum furthered that effort. “Y’all, please vote, these elections matter,” Gillum said. Voter turnout in local elections is typically low, especially in off-year elections like this one where there are no state or federal candidates on the ballot. The runoff election is April 23. Two other City Council races and the mayor’s race are also on the ballot. Share this:"
‘Equal Pay Day’ Perpetuates The Mythical Gender-Wage Gap,thefederalist.com,The Federalist Staff,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/03/equal-pay-day-perpetuates-mythical-gender-wage-gap/,"April 3, 2019 By The Federalist Staff This is an excerpt from The BRIGHT Newsletter. Subscribe HERE.
The Left is at it once again, making victims of the freest, most prosperous women in the world. Yes, I’m talking about us—American women.
In honor of Equal Pay Day, Mother Jones claimed the pay gap costs women $840 billion every year. CNBC reported it represents a $1 million shortfall for “some women.” But as our Thursday BRIGHT editor Inez Stepman wrote in The Daily Caller , this isn’t really true.
“The Department of Labor compiled more than 50 peer-reviewed studies and concluded that the often-cited 77 cents on the dollar gap — calculated by comparing the average female wage with the average male one — was ‘almost entirely’ the result of differing career choices rather than discrimination,” she wrote, adding:
Despite earning more degrees than their male counterparts, American women continue to frustrate left-wing feminists by making different work-life balance decisions. When given the same choices as men, women select different fields of study, value flexibility over salary, work fewer hours, and avoid physically dangerous employment.” Four out of five of the top-paying college majors have large majorities of male students, while the reverse is true of the five lowest-paid majors, where women boast large majorities in all but one. Women take about twice as many unpaid hours off, and men work 83 percent more overtime. And a plurality of mothers with young children still report that their ideal situation involves part-time, not full-time, work.
More quick facts, from the Independent Women’s Forum: Wage discrimination is illegal and has been in the U.S. since 1963, when the Equal Pay Act was signed into law. The 1964 Civil Rights Act also protects women from baseless gender discrimination in the workplace. “Equal Pay Day” is based on a misleading interpretation of wage data. The wage gap doesn’t take into account variables like profession, education, experience, benefits, work conditions, or hours worked. And it doesn’t compare men and women with the same jobs, experience, training, or hours. The wage gap is not a measure of “equal pay for equal work.” Instead, it’s largely a reflection of individual choices about work among women and men. When controlling for relevant factors, the pay gap shrinks to $0.98.
The irony is that on the same day progressives claim they’re advocating for women, they’re actually advocating to erase women with the Equality Act, which would treat womanhood as a mutable feeling rather than an immutable fact. Here are 7 reasons why the Equality Act is anything but ."
Calls grow to turn Tak into proper SEZ - Mizzima Myanmar News and Insight,www.mizzima.com,,04-03-2019,2019,4,http://www.mizzima.com/article/calls-grow-turn-tak-proper-sez,"03 April 2019 Calls grow to turn Tak into proper SEZ
An ambitious plan to turn the border village of Kokko in Myanmar into a new Chinatown has sparked calls for the Thai government to speed up making Tak a fully-fledged special economic zone (SEZ).
The huge investments from Chinese businessmen in Kokko, opposite Tak's Mae Sot district, have already seen Thailand ""lose plenty of [business] opportunities,"" Mae Sot mayor Thoetkiat Chinsaranan said on Monday,
He said that as a result, the authorities need to fast track development projects in Tak to catch up with the construction of a new city in neighbouring Myanmar.
China-based Yatai International Holding Group is going ahead with its plan to give Kokko, located by the Moei River, a boost by making the riverside city a border trade centre and tourism destination replete with coveted residential areas.
Yatai Group has been granted a contract to lease land for a period of more than 50 years by the Border Guard Force, a Karen security force that overseas the village.
With an airport, roads, a modern logistics system, an entertainment complex and an elegant housing estate, this is believed to be the largest mega-project in Southeast Asia -- and one that will draw Chinese people to form a new Chinatown there.
""Their numbers will be four times higher than those in Mae Sot,"" said Suchat Triratwatthana, an adviser to the Tak Chamber of Commerce.
Kokko lies just 22 kilometres from the town of Myawaddy in southeastern Myanmar's Kayin state.
Mr Suchat echoed Mr Thoetkiat's call for more active development in Tak. He said when the Kokko project is completed, which reports say could take up to a decade, it would affect Thai-Myanmar border trade in Mae Sot.
Local authorities and businessmen agree the government must throw considerable efforts behind its SEZ project in Tak, which covers Mae Sot, Phop Phra and Mae Ramat districts.
Currently, the government has set 10 provinces, adjacent to Myanmar, Laos, Cambodia and Malaysia, as SEZs to promote border trade and business activities with neighbouring countries.
In 2016, border trade accounted for 10% of Thailand's total exports. The Thai government plans to draw foreign investors through a tax incentive programme and, expects 13 industries including agriculture and tourism will benefit from the SEZs.
Officials have organised trips overseas to gather ideas for how to develop SEZ models, ""but since their study trips, things have fallen quiet"", Mr Suchat said.
Land prices in Tak spiked after the SEZ plan, but the excitement has since died down, he said, adding the government should send experts to rekindle interest.

Voter turnout for the Tampa runoff is pacing well ahead of last month's municipal race,floridapolitics.com,,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://floridapolitics.com/archives/292442-voter-turnout-for-the-tampa-runoff-is-pacing-well-ahead-of-last-months-municipal-race,"on April 2, 2019 Voter turnout for the April 23 runoff in Tampa municipal races is tracking 4 percent higher than the March 5 election. According to the most recent vote-by-mail ballot rate of return, voter turnout in the March 5 municipal election was just 21 percent — one point lower than the 2011 election in which Bob Buckhorn made the runoff against Rose Ferlita . Turnout for their runoff stayed about the same. Political consultants this year thought turnout might drop even lower in the runoff because competition in the four races on the ballot, including for Mayor, is low. But that doesn’t appear to be the case. As of Monday, nearly 16,000 voters had already returned a ballot . That’s almost 28 percent of all who requested one and puts overall voter turnout so far at 7 percent. At the same point after mail ballots went to voters for the March 5 election, just 6,000 voters had cast a vote accounting for 10.5 percent of all who had requested one and representing only 3 percent overall turnout. For the most part, all of the races on the ballot in the upcoming election have a clear front-runner . Jane Castor only narrowly missed winning her election outright last month with 48 percent of the vote in a seven-way race. David Straz made the runoff with just 15 percent, putting him at a distinct disadvantage despite waging a heavily funded race. The story is similar for three City Council contests on the runoff ballot. In District 1, Joe Citro finished first with 31 percent of the vote. His runoff opponent, Walter Smith II , came in second 12 points behind him . The vote disparity in District 3 is even more significant. Former Tampa City Council member John Dingfelder captured 49 percent of the vote while the second place finisher, Stephen Lytle , brought in just 20 percent. District 5, which includes downtown and East Tampa, was closer. Jeffrey Rhodes led that race with a two-point margin over Orlando Gudes . But Gudes has raised nearly triple his opponent, making a single-member, down-ballot race the only obviously competitive one on this ballot. The turnout trends so far based on vote-by-mail returns suggests Castor’s get out the vote strategy might be working . The campaign has been canvassing neighborhoods and focusing efforts on running a positive campaign and getting out the vote. It was widely accepted that a Castor victory was all but guaranteed as long as she got her supporters to the polls and captured even just a sliver of some of the votes from opponents who didn’t make the runoff. That was made all the more doable when the third and fourth place finishers in the race, Harry Cohen and Dick Greco , both endorsed her. It also suggests that Straz’s strategy might not be working. While Castor has been running a positive campaign based on her experience and issues facing the city, Straz has been waging a negative campaign, criticizing Castor for her leadership as Tampa’s first female police chief, accusing her of double-dipping and arguing that running a police department is not the appropriate resume for being mayor. Of course, conventional political wisdom and voting trends have proved to be unreliable in recent years. Most recently, Andrew Gillum bunked polls showing he had an advantage against now Gov. Ron DeSantis last year. And of course, Donald Trump ’s victory was counter to just about every poll nationwide showing Hillary Clinton was a shoo-in for the presidency. Still, if voter turnout improves over last month, it’s most likely better for Castor than it is for Straz and, whoever voters support, increased voter engagement is an overall win for democracy. The numbers will become more apparent as more voters return, or don’t return, mail ballots and when early voting begins April 14. Share this:"
Christiane Amanpour: ‘Lock Her Up’ Is ‘Hate Speech’ The FBI Should ‘Shut Down’,thefederalist.com,Emily Jashinsky,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/03/christiane-amanpour-lock-hate-speech-fbi-shut/,"April 3, 2019 By Emily Jashinsky
Christiane Amanpour thinks “lock her up” is “kind of hate speech.” Her desire for such a sweeping designation comes as part of a larger pattern.
Amanpour’s assertion about the anti-Clinton language came in the form of a question to James Comey during a live sit-down interview with the former FBI director on CNN Tuesday afternoon. Here’s the exact wording :
Of course, ‘lock her up’ was a feature of the 2016 Trump campaign. Do you, in retrospect, wish that people like yourself, the FBI, I mean, the people in charge of law and order, had shut down that language—that it was dangerous potentially, that it could’ve created violence, that it’s kind of hate speech. Should that have been allowed?
Notice how the notion that “lock her up” constitutes “hate speech” is baked into her line of inquiry. Clearly Amanpour wasn’t playing devil’s advocate, but seeking Comey’s response to a sincerely held belief, and contending there’s a legitimate question as to whether the government should have disallowed the language in 2016.
It’s also well-worth noting Amanpour’s desired outcome in this case goes even further than most leftist efforts to narrow the boundaries of acceptable speech in that she actually suggested government intervention. That sentiment reaches so far beyond our (rightfully narrow) boundaries of reasonable speech restrictions it’s almost baffling.
But it’s not random. From college campuses to newsrooms to Silicon Valley, the left’s censorious impulse is increasingly strong, increasingly sweeping , and increasingly powerful. That’s partially because it’s no longer isolated to campuses, but has apparently crept into places like Google and CNN.
“Lock her up,” isn’t something I would chant, but it’s hardly hate speech. Given the opportunity to ban speech they dislike, more and more powerful people actually would.
Conservative complaints about incidents of social media censorship, to take just one issue, are almost always deeper than any single controversy, trivial as those dust-ups can sometimes seem. They’re rooted in a sense that the gatekeepers of our culture—people in classrooms and boardrooms and newsrooms—are closing their doors on non-leftist expression. Amanpour makes that difficult to deny.
Indeed, her assertion serves as clear-cut evidence this anxiety is much more than self-pity and paranoia. It wasn’t the work of a crazed Twitter pundit or hyper-partisan blogger. It was the “chief international anchor” of a major cable network, a powerful woman who’s widely respected in her industry, using airtime to argue federal law enforcement should have stopped people from saying “lock her up.”
Amanpour’s question to Comey—who, to his credit, gave the right response—reminds us the desire to ban political expression is rising among the very people who have the power to do it. It’s much too early to declare defeat or descend into panic, but the problem is entirely real. Emily Jashinsky is culture editor at The Federalist. You can follow her on Twitter @emilyjashinsky ."
Stop Trying To Make Pete Buttigieg Happen,thefederalist.com,David Marcus,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/03/stop-trying-make-pete-buttigieg-happen/,"April 3, 2019 By David Marcus
Pete Buttigieg, the jolly and substantive mayor of South Bend, Indiana, is having his day in the sun. Conservatives like David Brooks in The New York Times and liberals like, well, everyone on CNN seem convinced that Mayor Pete is having a breakthrough moment. Loathe as I am to be a wet blanket, I think this is all pretty much crazy talk.
The big news yesterday was that Buttigieg, whose last name Americans may or may not eventually learn to pronounce, had raised $7 million in the first quarter of his campaign. That’s not chump change. The only two other campaigns that announced their earnings, Bernie Sanders and Kamala Harris, had $18 and $12 million, respectively. Seven million dollars is a lot of walking around money, and not to be sneezed at, but the 1-3 percent that Buttigieg is polling at nationally is only 1-3 percent more than I’m getting.
The national media seem to have a thing for Mayor Pete, and so do some of his competitors’ campaigns. Buttigieg is most often set against Beto O’Rourke, and that makes a lot of sense, since O’Rourke more than any candidate not named Biden or Sanders has made the strongest moves in polling since announcing his candidacy. The natural inclination seems to be that Buttigieg pulls voters from Beto. But I’m not so sure.
Ultimately the thing Buttigieg is missing is star power. His aw shucks story is fun and uplifting, but he doesn’t control a room, much less a TV screen. As much as we would like to believe that presidential races are decided by policies and qualifications, we know that they aren’t. Every president elected in the modern age has a spark of personality, a bigger than life quality that makes us believe he can hold such a high and powerful office. Buttigieg doesn’t have that.
So why are all of the important outlets and people pretending Buttigieg has what it takes? Some of it is identity politics. Much to the consternation of the editorial class in New York and Los Angeles, Democratic voters nationwide seem fine with voting for old, straight, white men. Bernie and Biden aren’t supposed to be leading in the polls, but here we are. O’Rourke, who has now moved into third place ahead of Harris, is just salt in the wound. The wokening of the Democratic Party isn’t happening fast enough.
The best way to think of Buttigieg’s candidacy, and its current embrace by the media, is as a timeout. The first quarter of the Democratic primary is coming to an end, and the teams are in a bit of disarray. The Robert Mueller report is a disaster for Democrats, and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s nonsensical ramblings are grabbing more headlines than is any Democratic contender for president. The race increasingly looks like it will come down to Biden, Sanders, and Beto. That’s not the primary most liberal commentators wanted or expected.
But timeouts are tactical. They don’t really change the game. There is no reason to believe Buttigieg will ever poll in the double digits, and there is plenty of reason to believe that he won’t. He is, simply put, not a serious candidate for president, but a placeholder while Democrats try to decide who they are. Who they are, however, is becoming increasingly clear, and it’s not the fainting couch faculty lounge crowd that so many believe it to be.
Buttigieg may well have a long and productive career in American politics. One can imagine him a future senator from Indiana, perhaps a governor, eventually perhaps even more. But he is not going to be the 2020 Democratic nominee for the presidency. And everyone should really stop pretending that is even a remote possibility. It isn’t.
The Democratic primary is definitively taking shape. It does not have the features that the progressive base hopes for. Buttigieg is not going to change that. Democrats appear poised to do something they have not done since 2004: nominate a straight white man for president.
For this, that, and the other reason this is surely problematic. On the other hand, they may nominate someone who can beat Trump. Time will tell. But one thing is certain, that person will not be Pete Buttigieg. It’s been nice to meet you, Mr. Mayor, but your 15 minutes are up.

"With Many Democrats Worried About Abortion, Why Is Joe Biden Becoming More Radical?",thefederalist.com,Georgi Boorman,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/03/joe-biden-cant-be-more-vocal-about-his-support-of-abortion-on-demand/,"By Georgi Boorman April 3, 2019
Now that Joe Biden is widely expected to formally announce his campaign this month, his record on abortion is under intense scrutiny by members of the Democratic Party and left-leaning media outlets. On Friday, The New York Times’ Lisa Lerer outlined Biden’s evolution on abortion . The article frames Biden’s history as falling short of the current Democratic standard.
What is that standard? Abortion on demand, up to birth, for any reason.
“Some of Mr. Biden’s more moderate-to-conservative stances in his legislative record are raising questions in the party about whether he could win over an ascendant liberal wing eager to impose purity tests around issues of race and gender in 2020,” writes Lerer.
NARAL’s president Ilyse Hogue told the Times that, “anxiety is super high among women across the country,” and that “Joe Biden … is going to have to really get with the times and understand that standing with abortion rights is the middle, moderate position.”
Never mind the fact that abortion to the point of — possibly even after — birth is the most extreme position on abortion so, by definition, it cannot be the “middle, moderate position.” There is no more extreme stance on abortion than what the abortion lobby has turned into the standard Democratic position. Biden Coming under Fire
Biden is under scrutiny for, among other things, having once voted to let states overturn Roe V. Wade, although he later voted against that. Biden’s spokesman, Bill Russo, defended Biden’s record on Roe by saying the senator had mounted “fierce opposition to the nomination of conservative judge, Robert H. Bork,” for the Supreme Court over 30 years ago, a move he claims was key to preserving the Roe precedent.
Although Biden has struggled to reconcile his Roman Catholic beliefs with his policy positions, he told the magazine America: the Jesuit Review in 2015 , “I’m prepared to accept that at the moment of conception there’s human life and being, but I’m not prepared to say that to other God-fearing, non-God-fearing people that have a different view.”
Biden, Al Gore, and many other Democrats used to oppose government funding of abortion. “It’s not the government’s business,” Biden explained more than three decades ago. He voted repeatedly for the Hyde Amendment, which prohibits federal dollars from directly funding abortions.
Yet he was more pro-life than the hands-off position. The New York Times reports Biden’s stance in 1997 on a bill to ban partial-birth abortions: “‘It did not, as I would have liked, ban all post-viability abortions,’ he said, backing a proposal by Senator Tom Daschle, the Democratic majority leader, that would include an exception if the mother’s health was at risk. ‘I was and still am concerned that in banning on partial-birth abortions, we do not go far enough.’”
Not supporting abortion on demand after viability would be an immediate disqualifier for any federally elected Democrat just two decades later, yet if a governor implies children born alive after attempted abortion don’t have the right to live, it’s just another controversy to weather until the news cycle runs its course.
Biden now says “government doesn’t have ‘a right to tell other people that women, they can’t control their body.’” The former vice president’s personal evolution on abortion is a microcosm of a greater shift in the national politics of both parties. Democrats’ radicalism has dragged Republicans down. With a Republican-controlled Congress and Republican president in 2017-2018, they should have been able to pass the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, but due to the moral cowardice of two Republicans—Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins—they could not. Just three Democratic senators braved the wrath of their party to vote in favor of the bill. A Shift in Rhetoric and Beliefs
Scientists know more about life in the womb now than ever before, yet Democratic politicians are more radically pro-abortion than ever before, relying on nonsensical philosophical arguments instead of science. Republicans have accommodated the shift, in voting records if not in campaign rhetoric—bringing anything more restrictive than a 2o-week ban to Congress’s floor for a vote would be unthinkable.
Indeed, when do facts ever get in the way of progress ? This is a heart matter, first and foremost, but the lure of campaign funding and sheer bully tactics have pressured Democrats to toe the line. The brutal tyrants of the culture of death have beaten the donkey into submission. Instead of pushing for state nullification of Roe like the slavery abolitionists , the elephant is lumbering along behind that donkey like another mindless pack animal.
If science can’t convince people who have access on demand to every expert in the country, as federally elected officials do, would pressure from voters make a difference?
Late-term abortions are deeply unpopular with the public, with just more than a third of Democrats saying they support abortion through the whole pregnancy (22 percent) or for the first six months (13 percent), according to the latest Marist poll . So, two out of three Democrats don’t support the position of the vast majority of their 2020 presidential contenders, or the positions of the majority of Democratic senators and representatives, 81 percent of whom had a 100 percent rating from NARAL in 2017. Democrat-leaning voters have already shown it’s not important for their representatives to have a moderate stance on abortion, so the pressure toward moderation is virtually non-existent.
As long as Democrats can successfully divert attention to more popular policy positions, they won’t have a problem rounding up blue voters who don’t agree with the dominant abortion-on-demand, up-to-birth position. Claims that Republicans are heartless and want to keep children in cages and “take away your health care” are apparently enough to justify voting for an abortion extremist, if indeed Democrat voters bother to frame it as a justification at all.
If abortion is acceptable on some level, then it is not hard to stretch a tacit blessing over all forms of abortion to protect popular entitlement programs, increase federal education spending, combat climate change, or whatever other policy positions are more important to the voter. For “moderate” pro-choicers, it’s not an all or nothing moral issue; it’s some, or some more.
Catholics lean Democrat 44 to 37 percent and, like Biden, are in favor of abortion in all or most cases, 51 to 42 percent. If most of these generally pro-choice Catholics are in the Democratic Party, as common sense dictates they would be, why would they be more staunchly opposed to abortion absolutism in 2019 than Biden himself? Despite his reservations, wouldn’t Biden vote for whomever the Democratic nominee turns out to be, no matter how radical his or her abortion stance? He also appears to be shying away from defending the less radical parts of his record as he prepares to launch his campaign, not turning it into an appeal to religious Democrats.
It’s no wonder. Not many voters who are truly opposed to abortion in all its forms, or even with the traditional exceptions for rape and the mother’s life, exist in the Democratic Party. Only 21 percent say it should be illegal in “all/most cases,” according to Pew Research Center, and that umbrella covers much more moderate views than the aforementioned pro-life orthodoxy.
Given these realities, abortion absolutism almost certainly will not make a difference in deciding the Democratic nominee. Will it come into play in the general election, though? Sixty percent of independents take the general pro-choice position of “legal in all/most cases,” and six in 10 Americans support at least first-trimester abortion. Party Leadership Won’t Become More Moderate
It may seem shocking to non-Democrats (and even some Democrats) that the party’s leadership has camped out on the far end of the pro-abortion spectrum. Although Democratic leadership is out of step with the public’s opinion and majority opinion within the party on abortion, it doesn’t really matter in itself, because abortion moderation isn’t a litmus test for moderately pro-choice voters. They are more likely to vote for someone who will “protect a woman’s right to choose” than someone they perceive as wanting to restrict abortion rights, which means Biden is at a disadvantage despite his past views being more closely aligned to those of the Democrat majority.
Instead, the probability of the extreme stance of the Democratic nominee being a bridge too far for any significant number of independents is going to depend on how persuasively Republicans frame the issue. Voting against protections for infants born alive after attempted abortion is a pretty egregious act. If the GOP can capitalize on this evil to show how heartless Democrats are regarding the most vulnerable citizens, they may successfully leverage the issue to keep Donald Trump in office.
Once again, however, we come back to the fact that Republicans in Congress haven’t made protecting the unborn a priority, and there is only so much Trump can do in the executive branch. If federal abortion policy is to move decisively in a pro-life direction, a great deal of effort must be poured into primarying lukewarm Republicans in the House and the Senate with true pro-life candidates, in addition to challenging Democrat incumbents.
Pro-life Democrats, of course, should push back hard against the abortion lobby or else leave the party. America will face a reckoning one day for the evil she has permitted and supported in abortion, just as with slavery. Both parties would do well to keep that in mind. "
Only School Choice Can Set Families Free From Transgender-Obsessed Public Schools,thefederalist.com,Inez Feltscher Stepman,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/03/school-choice-can-set-families-free-transgender-obsessed-public-schools/,"By Inez Feltscher Stepman April 3, 2019
When a biologically female student walked into the boys’ locker room in Chasco Middle School in Pasco County, Florida, recently, she quite literally caught some male students with their pants down.
When the boys ran to their gym teacher, embarrassed over being “observed changing by an obvious girl,” the teacher was not permitted—because of a school district gag order—to talk to them about it. Nor had he been permitted to warn them about possibly confronting a naked biological female in their locker room. When the gym teacher refused to supervise the locker room while the girl undressed, school administrators put him on administrative leave and threatened to transfer him to a different school.
For many parents, this state of affairs is profoundly problematic. For Democrats, it is social progress. For pusillanimous Republicans, many of whom still cling to platitudes about the public school system of 50 years ago, it’s a problem to be ignored.
But there is a policy solution to this issue which, if properly communicated and implemented, would reap profound political and cultural benefits for all American students: universal school choice. Whatever your opinion of transgender rights or locker rooms, these school policies should be set by the free choices of parents. This would be a welcome détente in the culture war that has spilled over into public schools and been made worse by the one-size-fits-all education status quo. School Choice Would Free Parents and Students
The situation in Pasco County presents Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis an opportunity to become America’s leading education governor, and to revolutionize the nature, purpose, and political appeal of school choice. Traditionally, state-level Republicans have expended a great deal of political capital to promote school choice as a policy to benefit a small, mostly Democratic constituency, while offering their suburban and rural constituents nothing more than rhetoric about flexibility and opportunity.
But this episode in Pasco County shows that, for many parents, local control is functionally dead. School administrators often care more about the approbation of politically correct activist groups than the moral preferences of parents. The only way to revive real democratic control is to empower parents to withdraw their children and take their taxpayer money with them.
Sometimes the cultural shove comes from Washington. The Pasco County school board has cited Obama-era federal precedents to justify their actions, and not without merit. Another school district, while willing to make dozens of other accommodations for a trans student, requested separate locker room facilities so female students would not be exposed to the naked body of a biological male. The Obama Department of Education found that commonsense concern “ unavailing ,” effectively determining that any particular effort to block the exposure of teenage girls to male genitalia violated Title IX.
While the Trump administration is no longer mandating such policies, the next Democratic administration is likely to resume federal pressure to override local control and parental preference by threatening to revoke federal funding for school districts that stop short of fully exposing students to the naked bodies of the opposite sex. Violating Parents’ Permission and Values
In the interim, the Pasco County School District has found its own way to override parents from within. The school board never actually passed any policy concerning students who identify as transgender. Rather, a single school district employee unilaterally wrote the policy, which also requires that staff use student-preferred pronouns and forbids school staff from speaking to gender-dysphoric students’ parents without student permission.
This is an alarming state of affairs for many Pasco County parents, but what power do they have? Because the school board never officially voted on this policy, school board members have not taken an official stance that could inform voters in the next election.
Without any other recourse, parents have enlisted the pro-bono aid of Liberty Counsel to try to demand that no employee be forced to use biologically incorrect pronouns, that the school district maintain the use of locker rooms on a biological basis, and that the district “prohibits all classroom LGBT political activism, specifically the drag queen coloring books.”
This episode raises two question: in how many other districts is this happening? And what can be done about it?
We do not fully know the answer to the first question, but Pasco County is not alone. Last year, a five-year-old in Georgia was allegedly sexually assaulted in a bathroom by a “gender-fluid” male classmate, after a similar districtwide policy was implemented. In California, parents have the right to be informed and opt out their children from sexual education on the results of heterosexual birds and bees, but not from “gender identity” and “gender expression” teachings. In New Jersey, a child’s parents astoundingly do not have the right to be told that their child is being treated as trans by the school. School Choice Would Help
The answer to the second question, and the solution to growing parent disempowerment on this and the many other culture war battles in public education, is universal school choice. School districts would be less likely to take an absolutist stance about this and other contentious cultural issues if parents could credibly threaten to enroll their children in a more morally congenial school and take taxpayer money with them.
Florida is already a national leader in school choice, offering private scholarships to low-income students, students with disabilities, and students who have been bullied. DeSantis could revolutionize the political appeal and cultural power of school choice by pointing to the controversy in Pasco County and proposing universal education savings accounts as the solution.
Parents have a right to have their moral voices heard within the public education system. School choice will empower them to exit it when their voices are ignored.

The 14 Most Hilarious Recommendations From Kourtney Kardashian’s New Lifestyle Website,thefederalist.com,Emily Jashinsky and Madeline Osburn,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/03/x-hilarious-recommendations-kourtney-kardashians-new-lifestyle-website/,"By Emily Jashinsky and Madeline Osburn April 3, 2019
Even though Kourtney Kardashian is the oldest sibling of America’s most famous family, she’s finally following her sisters’ entrepreneurial footsteps. Poosh, her just-launched lifestyle website, is such a brazen copy of Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop, Kourtney even cribbed the double o’s from her fearless predecessor. (“I was told that all big internet companies had two O’s in their title,” Gwyneth says. )
If Poosh turns out to be as Goopy as it aspires to be, expect a whole lot of hilariously unattainable solutions to everyday problems, bizarre product recommendations, and extremely dubious health advice. There was plenty of material to mock already on Day One. Remember, Poosh is “a place of discovery.” 1. Use Candles to Mask Your Cellulite
In a post titled, “How to Look Good Naked,” which is questionably under the category “Soul,” Kourtney says one way to look good in your birthday suit is to find the right lighting. “Great lighting can do wonders for masking cellulite (yes, we all have it), and harsh lighting can do just the opposite,” she writes. She also recommends drinking water and having good posture as ways to look good and feel confident. Revolutionary! 2. Lay On a $1,600 Infrared Amethyst Mat to Relax
A small price to pay for “added enjoyment and bliss” while losing yourself in a guided meditation. 3. It’s So Important to Use Clean, Non-toxic Products, But Not All the Time
One of Poosh’s focuses is health and wellness . “It’s all about choices, and if you opt for skin and hygiene products that are free of harmful chemicals, it leads to a cleaner and overall healthier way of living,” Kourtney writes. Every beauty post encourages readers to check their products with the Environmental Working Group’s database for ingredient concerns. There’s also a separate post dedicated to why it’s important to “recognize specific toxins that are red flags.” This all sounds very Goop-esque, until Kourt deviates from her own advice.
In a “Natural-ish” skincare and make-up routine she filmed for Vogue and wrote about on Poosh, Kourtney begins by lamenting that government beauty regulations have not been reformed in 80 years, saying she checks whether her products are “safe.” But when applying some of her make-up products later in the video, she admits she is scared to check the ingredients on her favorite concealer, presumably because if it’s “unsafe,” she wouldn’t be able use it.
“Mascara isn’t really going into your skin, so to me I choose — I don’t feel as guilty,” she explains when using a mascara brand that isn’t a clean beauty product. Then, to further confuse readers on her stance on natural beauty products, there is an additional entirely separate post on Poosh dedicated to recommending clean mascaras. 4. Improve Your Sleep With Organic Sheets
Having trouble getting some shut eye? Poosh says investing in your bedding is a great way to improve your sleep cycles.
“Non-natural threads contain harmful chemicals and pesticides which can result in allergic reactions and poor sleep cycles,” Poosh writes . “Moral of the story: Better sheets equals a better sleep.”
Sounds scientific. So what does Kourt put on her beds? Linens from Italy that don’t even list their prices online. It’s actually not even clear where a consumer could purchase the brand she recommends. 5. Make Sure to Pack Your Blood Cream
What is blood cream? Why is blood cream?
Apparently it’s “the latest skincare trend celebrities are swearing by. According to reports, blood cream is concocted by a German doctor who separates your plasma with a centrifuge, swirls it into a shea butter cream, and tells you to rub the delicious mixture on your skin—all for the affordable price of $1,400. Kourtney “ALWAYS” travels with it, so throw away your Cetaphil and help the doctor find a vein. 6. Make Over Your Bathroom By Buying Random Expensive Items
“Stocking your lavatory with pretty soap, soft scents, and a dash of greenery are only a few ways to add an elevated feel to the space,” Poosh writes.
Here are some of the bathroom products Kourtney recommends:
A Pablo Picasso print , $800 A lizard skin table lighter , $316 A set of alabaster containers , $1,882 A handwoven, leather paper basket , $1,390 7. Slice Food and Put It On a Plate
Poosh shares a recipe for, “Kourt’s Signature Salad,” which entails directions for how to hardboil eggs, then seasoning the eggs, sliced tomatoes, avocado, and cheese with salt and pepper. 8. Buy Your Child a $200 Teepee
For the stylish , culturally appropriative kid in your life who needs a “a space of their own to read and be creative in.” Anything less than pima cotton just won’t do. If the teepee is simply too affordable for your offspring, consider this $500 cloud rocker Kourtney recommends. 9. Complete Your Child’s Room with a ‘Statement Centerpiece’
And consider organizing your children’s toys “in aesthetically-pleasing linen-lined baskets.” 10. Roll up Salad in a Damp Cloth
This may indeed have some practical value, but it sounds disgusting . 11. Explore the ‘Amazing Benefits of Floating’
To restore and refresh your senses, try floating therapy , and relax in an easily attainable pool of water from the Dead Sea. 12. Reduce Stress with This ‘Trendy herb’
“Adaptogens have been used for centuries in Chinese and Ayurvedic traditions as healing herbs. The non-toxic plants are said to help the body cope with physical and mental pressures,” Poosh writes , before recommending holy basil, pearl powder, Ashwagandha, and “some mushrooms,” including reishi. Happy snacking! 13. Serve Party Guests Dairy-Free Nachos
Don’t do this. It’s not right. 14. Bring Louis Vuitton Playing Cards and Hermès Soaps as Hostess Gifts
Do you want to get invited back? Then take Kourtney’s advice and bring your hostess gift to the “next level” by not showing up without a tastefully outfitted, reasonably priced $485 deck of cards. They make “the perfect companion for a nomadic lifestyle,” because there’s nothing a true nomad loves more than hosting parties at her mansions for people with money to blow on luxury playing cards.

Tim Burton’s ‘Dumbo’ Is A Dark But Beautiful Celebration Of Individualism,thefederalist.com,Titus Techera,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/03/tim-burtons-dumbo-dark-beautiful-celebration-individualism/,"By Titus Techera April 3, 2019
If you’re looking for a heartwarming family film, you’re in luck this week. “Dumbo,” Tim Burton’s triumphant return to Disney, fits the bill. The story of a family coming together to save an adorable flying elephant, rediscovering their love for each other in the process, is the most beautiful Disney movie in a long time, which is exactly what Burton was hired to make.
Disney rarely spends money on talent and almost never allows talent to impose their vision on a story. The company wants to protect its various Disney brands and take no risks. “Dumbo,” then, is an exceptional event, and a bit difficult to explain, until you remember how stunned people were about the look of Burton’s “Alice in Wonderland,” which went on to gross $1 billion worldwide. It’s very hard to create anything fascinating with blockbuster-budget movies, because there are so many controls imposed by people who have money but no idea what audiences love, and it’s impossible if you have to make something family friendly, too, unlike, say “The Dark Knight.”
Burton is the amazing exception to this rule. His movies are instantly recognizable because of his style, which puts vulnerability and danger into beauty, remaining true to what we know about the tragic side of life. Burton’s had big hits for about 30 years now, because he knows what the American audience wants. This makes him irreplaceable.
A movie looks beautiful if the cinematographer is good, but it still needs a visionary director. Ben Davis, for instance, shot both “Dumbo” and “Captain Marvel,” and the latter looks embarrassingly cheap in comparison, like pre-ordered CGI. He also shot the much-better looking “Guardians of The Galaxy” directed by James Gunn, who’s back in the saddle for the third “Guardians,” after losing his job for tweeting awful jokes years back. Disney knows it sometimes needs directors who can wow audiences.
Burton is also an unusually honest storyteller, especially in the age of sarcasm, so he’s the best example of what the magic of the movies means. Directors like him use technology, enormous budgets, and the great expectations of the era of blockbuster entertainment to tell simple stories. It’s true we need a lot of showmanship to pay attention to stories we’d otherwise ignore, so we can feel they’re plausible, but ultimately that’s what we want—people like ourselves in situations whose moral importance we recognize.
“Dumbo” is about a father, played by Colin Farrell, trying to provide for his two children in a bad situation. They recently lost their mother and he’s somewhat clueless without his wife. Worse still, he’s a World War I veteran, returning without an arm. He’s trying to be a man, a provider, and protector, but he has few opportunities.
Worst of all, he’s in the fast-dying circus business. Before the war, he did cowboy stunts as the headlining act for Max Medici—played by Danny DeVito, who’s been acting the circus freak in Burton movies since playing the Penguin in 1992’s “Batman Returns.”
Here, Burton indulges our sentimentality and really plays on the wonder of nostalgic shows. The whole circus business is going to hell and we feel for all the freaks down on their luck. The first wonderful montage is this entire, movable show packing up and turning into a train, only to set up shop again somewhere else down the line. It’s not celebrity or the limelight that attracts us to them. It’s the freedom of moving about the vast expanse of America in search of business, discovering places and people. But steam trains are a thing of the past—the modernity of the previous century, now empty of the exciting promise of the future.
We want Max Medici and his circus freaks to succeed, however improbably, so Max buys an elephant, to give his circus some exotic appeal, and soon finds himself owner of a calf whose enormous ears make him look ugly. Enter Dumbo, who discovers by accident a penchant for flight. Fascination with a feather makes Dumbo sneeze his way to take off. Every time this happens it makes for delightful scenes, but they also set the stage for Dumbo’s career as a freak—a thing of wonder, but also a creature of mockery, beloved, but also harassed. Just like a modern celebrity.
Now, the story becomes impressive. Like the children’s movie, “Dumbo” also has something to offer adults. Burton identifies the circus with celebrity and our modern entertainment industries. His villain is the owner of Dreamland, the future of amusement park entertainment—in short, Walt Disney!
He’s played by the great Michael Keaton, a fixture of Burton movies going back to “Beetlejuice” in 1988. He combines technology and a ruthless head for business, and buys Dumbo to leverage him for the financial backing he needs to take over America’s imagination. He embodies the behind-the-scenes corruption and tyranny that’s always been tolerated in entertainment and it’s Dumbo’s job to destroy his empire.
But why should Burton want to exorcise the ghost of Walt Disney? Disney made Americans believe in the magic of the movies, achieved through animation, which means making images come alive through the use of light and electricity. Motion and an infinite imagination seemed to fit a young nation, newly empowered, always restlessly on the move, always looking for new things by which to define itself.
For about a century—the American century!—we’ve lived through this experience, mostly convinced it’s of our own making and therefore the future. But eventually the dream turns into nightmare, the fascination with celebrity becomes dark, and we learn that fantasies don’t come true. Burton has the villain say: Everything is possible—just imagine!
This is an attack on the Hollywood that lives off our fantasies, which is now dying with the celebrities it created. The fantasy-makers know it, too: Look at our next great magician after Walt Disney, Steven Spielberg. Up to “Jurassic Park,” he made Americans believe in magic all over again. Whether it’s aliens, like in “E.T.,” or technology, a fantasy of the future captivates us, promising we can get there if we dare to dream.
But Spielberg turned against this imagination. His only amazing movie since “Jurassic Park” was “The Adventures of Tin-Tin,” which had new 3D technology, but was all about an old European cartoon that rehearsed the fantasies of the age of colonial empires, an experience utterly foreign to America. His American fantasies, however, have lost their innocence, getting ever darker and more fearful of technological tyranny over life: “A.I.,” “Minority Report,” and “Ready Player One,” a trilogy of despair over the American future.
Burton knows all this. After all, he’s the magician who took over from Spielberg. Burton also charmed America with his imagination, but he never claimed to create new national fantasies. He doesn’t want to keep feeding our hopes to the exploitative corruption of Dreamland, but to burn it down and liberate the freaks imprisoned there. “Dumbo” symbolically effects this revolution that’s supposed to set America free from corporate-entertainment control. He wants finally to break the spell. We’ll take our chances afterward.
Burton is the freak who stands up for freaks . As individualists, they’re all-American. They stand out. It’s why they attract attention. They’re like the rest of us in some ways, even if freaks and their audiences cannot always get along. But now we all have something new in common. We’re living through the end of the circus Walt Disney helped start. From now on, we must look to ourselves for freedom, not to larger-than-life fantasies. This is a message for which conservatives, and all Americans, should be grateful.

Media Celebrates Another Deep State Hack Who Held Up Trump’s Agenda For Partisan Reasons,thefederalist.com,Adam Mill,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/03/tricia-newbold-is-not-a-noble-whistleblower-shes-a-disloyal-resister/,"By Adam Mill April 3, 2019
Earlier this week, the Washington Post found the nerve to breathlessly lionize Tricia Newbold, an unelected bureaucrat bent on blocking the president’s access to trusted advisers. The Post announced that the “whistleblower told lawmakers that more than two dozen denials for security clearances have been overturned during the Trump administration.”
These reversals include “the President’s daughter, her husband Jared Kushner and national security adviser John Bolton.” The story, like so many others, was dripping with innuendo against the president’s advisers but short on any actual misconduct that would justify denying security clearances. Security Clearances for Partisan Hacks?
Who decides what’s in the national security interests of the United States? Is it former CIA director John Brennan, who actively promoted the hoax that the elected president is a Russian agent? President Trump revoked Brennan’s security clearance in August 15, 2018 . But Brennan still held a clearance while MSNBC paid him to say this :
I think he is afraid of the president of Russia….the Russians may have something on him personally that they could always roll out and make his life more difficult… this fawning attitude toward Mr. Putin, has not said anything negative about him, I think continues to say to me that he does have something to fear and something very serious to fear.
Until August 2018, Hillary Clinton maintained a security clearance. Under that clearance, she maintained a small stable of researchers who included Cheryl Mills, her former chief of staff, and four unnamed others. The Department of Justice gave Mills an “immunity” agreement during its investigation of Clinton’s mishandling of classified information. U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth said of this agreement:
I had myself found that Cheryl Mills had committed perjury and lied under oath in a published opinion I had issued in a Judicial Watch case where I found her unworthy of belief, and I was quite shocked to find out she had been given immunity in — by the Justice Department in the Hillary Clinton email case.
Lamberth added, “So I did not know that until I read the IG report and learned that and that she had accompanied the Secretary to her interview.” Worse yet, the “immunity agreement,” essentially operated as a pardon because it doesn’t appear the government got anything out of the very generous grant of clemency to Mills. Just to review: Mills continued to maintain a security clearance despite lying under oath about the circumstances of an alleged mishandling of classified information.
Andrew McCabe, the deputy FBI director found to have repeatedly lied to federal investigators, kept his security clearance until the day he was fired ( March 2018 ) in spite of a damning February 2018 inspector general report that documented repeated instances of McCabe lying to investigators—often under oath. Many of those instances were known in the FBI months before the IG report was issued.
We could go on and on with a list of former of even current employees maintaining security clearances long after demonstrating themselves to be enemies of the policies of a president the American people elected to carry out those policies. Newbold appears to have used her special access to the security clearance process to leak to NBC News that her office had rejected the Kushner clearance. What’s the Purpose of Security Clearances?
The purpose of maintaining a security clearance is to provide access to classified material by an employee or former employee who “requires access to a particular level of classified information in order to perform or assist in a lawful and authorized governmental function.”
There is a long list of extremely questionable security clearances being maintained long after the Trump opponents holding them stopped pretending to serve the current administration in any constructive way. Newbold’s whistle remained conspicuously un-blown when, for example, it came to light that Bruce Ohr’s wife took money from a Clinton subcontractor while Ohr abused his authority and prominence to promote his wife’s research to spur a bogus criminal investigation of a political candidate.
Do you notice a pattern? The security clearances only “jeopardize” national security when a Trump adviser has some cooked-up blemish in his or her record. But let the sirens scream impotently if the security clearance is maintained by a Trump hater.
The Washington Post went on to report: “Multiple newspapers, including The Washington Post, reported that Trump early last year directed his then-chief of staff, John F. Kelly, to give Kushner a top-secret security clearance—a move that made Kelly so uncomfortable that he documented the request in writing, according to current and former administration officials.”
In theory, the security clearance process should be a confidential one in which the elected head of the executive branch has the right to overrule the politically based objections of the career bureaucrats still chafing from the 2016 election results. President Trump is accountable to the voters, and they will have the opportunity to grade his decisions regarding national security.
Newbold is an unelected bureaucrat who is attempting to interfere with the president’s ability to access trusted advisers. She’s free to pass on her concerns and objections to the president, but she is not free to overrule him.
What is the supposed basis of Newbold’s security concerns? That part she kept secret, but nevertheless dropped some vague innuendo, telling us that she is, “keeping a list of employees whose applications were denied but were later given clearances despite concerns about their ties to foreign influence, conflicts of interests, questionable or criminal conduct, financial problems or drug abuse.”
Wow, “ties to foreign influence?” “Questionable criminal conduct?” Here we go again, more “if true….!!!” innuendo by the Deep State smear patrol. If Newbold has actual evidence of misconduct by these advisers, she can blow the whistle on that. Otherwise, she’s not a whistleblower, she’s an insubordinate to the American people she’s supposed to serve. Adam Mill is a pseudonym.

"The More People Like Jussie Smollett Cry Wolf, The Less People Believe In Hate Crimes",thefederalist.com,Joseph D'Hippolito,04-02-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/02/people-like-jussie-smollett-cry-wolf-less-people-believe-hate-crimes/,"April 2, 2019
Two of history’s most famous storytellers can provide insight into a modern political controversy.
One is Aesop, the ancient Greek author of fables, including “The Boy Who Cried Wolf.” In that fable, a young, bored shepherd amuses himself by pretending a wolf is chasing his sheep. When the shepherd yells, “Wolf, wolf,” nearby villagers run from their homes to help. When no wolf can be found, the shepherd laughs at the villagers’ credulity. When a real wolf threatens his sheep, however, the villagers refuse to be fooled again, despite the shepherd’s sincere pleas.
Now move from the hills of Greece to the streets of Chicago, where a young actor, Jussie Smollett, claimed to be a victim of racism. Smollett asserted that two men wearing “Make America Great Again” caps attacked him and tied a noose around his neck while yelling racist and anti-gay slurs on Jan. 29. California Sen. Kamala Harris , New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker , and Rev. Al Sharpton were among those decrying the apparent attack, with both senators demanding federal laws against lynching.
When Chicago police found that Smollett fabricated the incident, they arrested him Feb. 21 and charged him with felony disorderly conduct. On March 7, a grand jury indicted Smollett on 16 felony charges. However, powerful people used their influence not only to get all charges dropped but also to get all records pertaining to the case sealed.
The “attack” on Smollett ostensibly reflects the increased bigotry that President Donald Trump supposedly inspires . Yet those perpetuating such hoaxes risk desensitizing Americans from legitimate racism by sacrificing truth on the altar of political expediency. Smollett Added to a Chorus Crying ‘Wolf!’
Smollett’s hoax merely attracted the most national attention among numerous similar fabrications. One week before the presidential election, an arsonist painted the words “Vote Trump” on the walls of the Hopewell Missionary Baptist Church, a black church in Greenville, Miss., before destroying it. The arsonist? Andrew McClinton, a black congregant with a prior criminal record.
Immediately after the election, a swastika and the words, “Heil Trump” and “Fag Church” were found on the walls of St. David’s Episcopal Church in Brown County, Indiana. The graffiti was “among numerous incidents that have occurred in the wake of Trump’s Election Day win,” wrote the Washington Post. Yet six months later, police arrested organist George Nathaniel Stang for vandalizing his own church.
“I suppose I wanted to give local people a reason to fight for good, even if it was a false flag,” wrote Stang, who added that he wanted to “mobilize a movement.”
In December 2016, Yasmin Seweid asserted that three intoxicated white men yelling “Donald Trump” called her a terrorist and tried to remove her hijab forcibly while riding a New York subway. Seweid also claimed no other passengers tried to help her. But Seweid admitted to fabricating the incident, and was arraigned two weeks later for filing a false criminal report, a misdemeanor in New York State. Hate Hoaxes Are Rife on Campuses, Too
In 2017, students at St. Olaf’s College, Drake University, Kansas State University, and the Air Force Academy Preparatory School found threatening messages with anti-black insults on campus. The messages appeared in notes on car windshields or under dormitory doors, on whiteboards, and as painted graffiti on a car.
The Air Force Academy’s superintendent, Lt. Gen. Jay B. Silveria, asked students, faculty members, and staffers gathered at a meeting to use their cell phones to record his message, in which he briefly referenced the riots at Charlottesville, Va. and Ferguson, Mo.: “If you can’t treat someone with dignity and respect, then you need to get out.” The Air Force posted Silveria’s entire five-minute speech on its Twitter account.
At Kansas State, black students led similar meetings to discuss possible racism on campus. The FBI even began a civil rights investigation.
Larger rallies took place at St. Olaf’s and Drake. Students at St. Olaf’s , a Lutheran college in Minnesota, staged protests, presented their demands by interrupting a forum, and forced classes to be cancelled for one day. At Drake, about 3,500 attended a rally supporting two minority students who received racist notes in their dorms.
“Why do you only show up in times of crisis?” Maleigha Williams, president of Drake’s Coalition of Black Students, asked the crowd. “Why do you only come when someone asks you to?”
Ensuing investigations, however, determined that the incidents at all three colleges were staged . Students from Drake , Kansas State , and the Air Force Academy Preparatory School —the reported targets of the messages—admitted writing them.
In September 2018, Adwoa Lewis from Baldwin, N.Y. claimed that as she was driving home, four white teenagers told her she “didn’t belong here” and yelled “Trump 2016.” When Lewis awoke the next morning, she found one of her tires slashed and a note on her windshield telling her to “go home.” But police discovered that the confrontation never happened, and Lewis admitted writing the note. Fears of Saying the Truth Abound
Those examples reflect a larger problem that another famous author, Hans Christian Andersen, addressed in his story , “The Emperor’s New Clothes.” Two swindlers, posing as weavers, persuaded an emperor to purchase garments made from materials that would be invisible to anybody who was stupid or unfit for office. Naturally, the weavers produced nothing. But the emperor, his courtiers, and his subjects believed the weavers’ lies for fear of finding themselves stupid or unfit. ‘Simply put, Klansmen armed with nooses are not lurking on Chicago street corners.’
In today’s United States, the lie is the idea that Trump promotes a resurgence of the kind of bigotry that enabled Jim Crow to flourish and 30,000 members of the Ku Klux Klan to demonstrate their power in 1925 by marching down Pennsylvania Avenue. The fear is the dread of being considered “racist,” and the swindlers are such notables as Harris, Booker, Sharpton, and the rest of the “democratic socialists” in the academy, the media, the entertainment industry, and the Democratic Party, all of whom refuse to confront the hoaxers forthrightly.
“There is very little brutally violent racism in the modern USA,” wrote Wilfred Reilly, an assistant political science professor at Kentucky State University, a historically black college, for USA Today. “There are less than 7,000 real hate crimes reported in a typical year. Inter-racial crime is quite rare. 84 percent of white murder victims and 93 percent of Black murder victims are killed by criminals of their own race, and the person most likely to kill you is your ex-wife or husband. When violent inter-racial crimes do occur, whites are at least as likely to be the targets as are minorities.”
“Simply put, Klansmen armed with nooses are not lurking on Chicago street corners.” Hate Hoaxes Desensitize People to Real Racism
Yet facts cannot serve a manipulative narrative.
“In college campus hate hoax cases … the individuals responsible almost invariably say that they staged incidents to call attention to real incidents of racist violence on campus,” Reilly wrote. “Certainly, the media giants that leap to publicize hate crime stories later revealed to be fakes, and the organizations that line up to defend their ‘victims’ — the Southern Poverty Law Center, Black Lives Matter, CAIR — think that they are providing a public service by fighting bigotry.” They not only risk desensitizing Americans from legitimate racism. They declare the civil rights movement to be a monumental failure.
James S. Robbins, a columnist for USA Today, believes Smollett exploited that mindset.
“Why did Smollett believe that his alleged plan to manufacture outrage would succeed?” Robbins wrote . “Most probably because it was designed to fit a specific, well-established victimhood narrative. In this case, it was the young, gay, black celebrity versus the beastly, MAGA-preaching white racist homophobes. There is no ambiguity in that almost cartoonish scenario.
“The props and Trump-implicating rhetoric were necessary to establish the supposed hate motive. Otherwise Smollett might have been viewed as just another Chicago crime victim. And it was important to tie the faux attack to the idea prevalent on the left that the advent of the Trump era has unleashed an unprecedented wave of violence against ‘the other’” (emphasis added).
By perpetuating that lie, “democratic socialists” do more than cynically promote their agenda. They not only risk desensitizing Americans from legitimate racism. They declare the civil rights movement to be a monumental failure. They essentially assert that such men and women as Martin Luther King Jr., Rosa Parks, Medgar Evers, James Meredith, Ralph Abernathy, and the Freedom Riders fought—and, in some cases, died—in vain.
Those who perpetrate and enable false racial crimes must remember the advice an old villager gave the young shepherd at the end of Aesop’s fable: “Nobody believes a liar…even when he is telling the truth!” Joseph D'Hippolito is a freelance writer whose commentaries have appeared in the Jerusalem Post, The Stream, Front Page Magazine, and American Thinker."

In an interview which aired yesterday, CNN’s Christiane Amanpour asked Comey whether he “feared” a counter investigation into himself and the FBI. Advertisement
‘I don’t fear it personally,” he said. “I fear it as a citizen, right? Investigate what? Investigate that investigations were conducted? What would be the crime you’d be investigating?” Comey asked.
He continued, “So it’s a terrible cycle to start. He’s already started it with calling for the locking up of his political opponents, including people like me. And so it would just be more of that dangerous step. And I would hope, although he continued to disappoint me, the Republicans would finally stand up and say, we don’t do that kind of thing. But me, personally, ask me questions. Go ahead. I’d like to answer them in the daylight, if I could, but ask me — ask me questions.”
Many Republicans, including President Trump himself have called for an investigation into the handling of the Trump-Russia probe. Advertisement

A fire destroyed large parts of the Highlander Research and Education Center, a civil rights center in New Market, Tenn. with the Washington Post and other media outlets reporting that a “white power” symbol was found nearby: After a massive fire at a famous civil rights center, officials found a ‘white power’ symbol nearby https://t.co/4haX6VUd0d

Luckily most of the collection was housed in a different building and are safe. Authorities are investigating :
The fire is being investigated by the Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office, the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation and state fire investigators. Its origin has not been determined.
Oddly, the Washington Post didn’t get around to describing the “white power” symbol until the 7th paragraph where we learn that what they found was a “hashtag-like” symbol: Jefferson County Sheriff Jeff Coffey, who did not return a request for comment, told the Knoxville News Sentinel that the graffiti was a hashtag-like symbol discovered at the scene Friday. “It’s not a traditional, throw-it-in-your-face symbol that you would immediately recognize,” Coffey told the newspaper. “But it has been used by individuals in the past. We have seen this symbol associated with different groups.” In a statement posted to Facebook, the center said the symbol was “ spray-painted on the parking lot .” No photograph was included: We also found a symbol connected to the white power movement spray-painted on the parking lot connected to the main office. Sheriff Coffey told the Knoxville News Sentinel that he’s requested the aid of “another law enforcement agency” to investigate the hashtag graffiti, but for some reason, it’s a secret: The sheriff said his office has requested assistance from another law enforcement agency to verify the context of the symbol. Coffey declined to specify which agency has been contacted. Now, we’re not saying this wasn’t a hate crime, but we do remember a similar incident when Sarah Silverman mistook a surveyor’s mark for a swastika: 'No one is this dumb': Sarah Silverman confuses surveyor's mark with a swastika? https://t.co/sOWY3M50kO

Yesterday the voters in Chicago swung for the fences and hit a home run by electing political novice Lori Lightfoot as their new mayor.
The voters replaced a politically well-connected, straight, white guy with a gay, black, female who has never run for office before. She beat back a challenge from an entrenched, Democratic, political heavyweight who was hand-picked by ex-mayor Rahm Emanuel.
The key issue in this election was which candidate was the most progressive. Mayor Lightfoot won that argument going away.
The Democratic Party must nominate the most progressive candidate available to run against Trump in 2020. Leave a Reply"

Donald Trump Says He Calls China’s Leader ‘King’ and Xi Likes It Like That,www.newsweek.com,Brendan Cole,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-says-he-calls-chinas-leader-king-and-xi-likes-it-1384497,"President Donald Trump has boasted about his friendly relationship with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, saying that flattery clearly works.
Despite strained ties between the two countries amid a lengthy trade war, the U.S. president told a fundraising dinner in Washington, D.C. on Tuesday that he stroked Xi’s ego by calling him a monarch.
“President Xi, who is a strong man, I call him ‘king’,” Trump told the crowd.
“He said, ‘But I am not king, I am president.’ I said, ‘No, you are president for life, and therefore you are king.’ He said, ‘Huh…huh.’ He liked that. I call him ‘king’. I get along with him great,” Trump said, prompting laughter, CNN reported.
President Donald Trump and China's President Xi Jinping arrive at a state dinner at the Great Hall of the People on November 9, 2017, in Beijing. Trump has bragged of a friendly relationship with the Chinese leader. Thomas Peter - Pool/Getty Images Trump said he made the remark to Xi when he went to Beijing in November 2017, although the “president-for-life” reference did not coincide with the abolition of the term limit of the Chinese head of state, which had been 10 years. The National People’s Congress only abolished the term limit of the Chinese presidency four months after Trump’s visit, the South China Morning Post reported.
While brandishing his warm ties with the Chinese leader, Trump reportedly told those attending the fundraiser that he could also play bad cop as well as good cop, and that he “was really hitting him hard about how they have hurt our country.""
“And I had 5,000 Chinese people [watching]. I’m in China, I’m in Beijing, doing this. And he’s getting angrier and angrier, and then I saved it: I said, ‘You know, I don’t blame you, I blame the leaders of our country for allowing that to happen,’” he said at the National Republican Congressional Committee Annual Spring Dinner, according to the Washington Examiner.
Trade talks in Washington between the two countries will resume on Wednesday, when Chinese Vice Premier Liu He meets U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.
White House adviser Larry Kudlow said the two sides, which had been at loggerheads since the start of the trade war, were “expected to make headway,” Reuters reported.
Both countries have slapped hefty tariffs on each other’s goods since last year.
Beijing hopes that Washington can get rid of existing U.S. duties on Chinese imports, according to the Financial Times .
In a speech to the Republican committee, Trump said that if it had not been for the tariffs, the Chinese economy would have caught up with the U.S.
""They would have caught us within a short period of time...within two years, by the end of my term, if you had a normal president...they would have caught us. But right now it's going to be a long time before they catch us,"" he said, CNN reported.

Defending against audio deepfakes before it's too late - Axios,www.axios.com,Kaveh Waddell,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.axios.com/deepfake-audio-ai-impersonators-f736a8fc-162e-47f0-a582-e5eb8b8262ff.html,"Defending against audio deepfakes before it's too late Illustration: Sarah Grillo/Axios Big Tech, top university labs and the U.S. military are pouring effort and money into detecting deepfake videos — AI-edited clips that can make it look like someone is saying something they never uttered. But video's forgotten step-sibling, deepfake audio has attracted considerably less attention — despite a comparable potential for harm. What's happening: With video deepfakes, defenders are playing the cat to a fast-scurrying mouse: AI-generated video is getting quite good . The technology to create audio fakes, by contrast, is not as advanced — but experts say that's soon to change. Go deeper 540 Words ""In a couple years, having a voice [that mimics] an individual and can speak any words we want it to speak — this will probably be a reality,"" Siwei Lyu, director of SUNY Albany's machine learning lab, tells Axios. ""But we have a rare opportunity before the problem is a reality when we can grow the forensic technology alongside the synthesis technology,"" says Lyu, who participates in DARPA's Media Forensics program . Why it matters: Experts worry that easily faked but convincing AI impersonations can turn society on its head — running rampant fake news, empowering criminals, and giving political opponents and foreign provocateurs tools to sow electoral chaos. In the U.S., fake audio is most likely to supercharge political mayhem, spam calls and white-collar crime. But in places where fake news is already spreading disastrously on Telegram and WhatsApp (think India or Brazil ), a persuasive tape of a leader saying something incendiary is especially perilous, says Sam Gregory of Witness, a human-rights nonprofit. There are two main ways to use AI to forge audio: Modulation, which changes the quality of a voice to make it sound like someone else — from male to female, or British to American, for example. Boston-area startup Modulate.ai does this , as have researchers from China's Baidu. Synthesis, in which AI speaks any phrase typed into a box with a specific voice — like Trump's, for example. Montreal's Lyrebird can do this , as can Adobe's yet-unreleased VoCo , which can also rearrange, add or subtract words in an existing recording to make it sound completely different. Listen to an AI voice impersonating Ellen DeGeneres . Detecting audio deepfakes requires training a computer to listen for inaudible hints that the voice couldn't have come from an actual person. Lyu and UC Berkeley's Hany Farid are researching automated ways to do this. Google recently made a vast dataset of its own synthetic speech available to researchers who are working on deepfake detection. This trove of training data can help AI systems find and recognize the hallmarks of fake voices. For an international competition , 49 teams submitted deepfake detectors trained with Google's contribution, plus voices from 19 other sources in various languages. The top entrants were highly accurate, said competition co-organizer Junichi Yamagishi, a researcher at Japan's National Institute of Informatics. The best system only made mistakes 0.22% of the time, he tells Axios. Pindrop, an Atlanta company that sells voice authentication to big banks and insurance companies, is also developing defenses, worried that the next wave of attacks on its clients will involve deepfake audio. One key to detecting fakes, according to the company: sounds that seem normal, but that people aren't physically capable of making. An example from Pindrop CEO Vijay Balasubramaniyan: If you say ""Hello, Paul,"" your mouth can only shift from the ""o"" to ""Paul"" at a certain speed. Spoken too fast, ""the only way to say this is with a 7-foot-tall neck,"" Balasubramaniyan says. The bottom line: If deepfake detectors can get out ahead of the spread of fake audio, they could contain the potential fallout. And, unlike with video, it looks like the defenders could actually keep up with the forgers. "
German court closes case of former death-camp guard,ednews.net,,04-03-2019,2019,4,http://ednews.net/en/news/world/361049-german-court-closes-case-of-former-death-camp-guard,"1 2 3 4 5 German court closes case of former death-camp guard A- A A+
A court in Germany has closed the trial against a 95-year-old former guard at a Nazi death camp because of the defendant's health problems, almost certainly ending one of the last such Holocaust prosecutions.
The defendant, a German who cannot be named for legalreasons, is now considered permanently unfit to stand trial, the court in the western city of Muenster said on Wednesday.
A medical report found that physical and cognitive constraints linked to heart and kidney problems meant the man could not follow the proceedings. The decision can be contested, the court added.
However, the development suggests that the trial will be terminated for good. The court had already given prosecutors, joint plaintiffs and the defence a chance to make a statement on the underlying medical examination.
The court had halted the trial in February because of the defendant's ill health and said it intended to halt it permanently.
The man first appeared in court in November, accused of assisting in the murder of hundreds of people at Stutthof, a Nazi concentration camp during World War Two. A former guard in the SS paramilitary wing of Hitler's Nazis, he denied the charges.
During the trial, the wheelchair-bound man told the court that he had never been a Nazi and that he was not indifferent to the suffering of inmates.
The man was accused of knowing about killings between 1942 and 1944, when he served at Stutthof, near what is now the Polish city of Gdansk. About 65,000 people, including many Jews, were murdered or died there, according to the Stutthof museum's website.
""People were killed with a shot in the back of the head. People were left to starve, to freeze"", Chief Prosecutor Andreas Brendel, one of Germany's most active Nazi hunters, said in court.

Time for Ole Gunnar Solskjær to go. He’s had long enough to get it right. Three defeats in his last four games are not good enough for the new Manchester United manager and it can’t be a coincidence that Sam Allardyce has explicitly ruled himself out of the running for the vacant West Bromwich Albion job. Big Sam knows. Something’s up.
Move along, Ole. Big Sam’s going to be at the wheel next season and he’s already got big plans for the summer, with United ready to splurge £100m on Borussia Dortmund’s Jadon Sancho and rival Leicester City for Monaco’s Youri Tielemans. Both players will surely be unable to resist the chance to play for the former England manager, who could also have Philippe Coutinho at his disposal if Barcelona decide to sell the Brazilian. Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain are also eyeing the former Liverpool attacker.
However, United have been dealt a blow in their pursuit of Raphaël Varane after Zinedine Zidane said the defender will not be allowed to leave Real Madrid. The struggling European champions are more interested in signing players than losing their biggest stars – a policy that doesn’t apply to Thibaut Courtois, who will be allowed to leave in the summer – and are rivalling Juventus for Benfica whizzkid João Felix.
Speaking of Juventus, Arsenal sent scouts to watch them play against Cagliari on Tuesday night. Turns out they were watching Cagliari’s NicolòBarella, though. The 22-year-old midfielder will cost £43m.
Staying in Italy, Inter and Milan are trying to nab Pedro from Chelsea. Maurizio Sarri will try to convince them to sign Callum Hudson-Odoi instead. Be serious, Chelsea can’t be doing without Pedro.
Leicester are preparing a move for Victor Camarasa, who has spent the season on loan at Cardiff from Real Betis. Sneaky.

Trump changes MAGA to KAGA for 2020 elections,ednews.net,,04-03-2019,2019,4,http://ednews.net/en/news/politics/361009-trump-changes-maga-to-kaga-for-2020-elections,"1 2 3 4 5 Trump changes MAGA to KAGA for 2020 elections A- A A+
President Trump spoke at the National Republican Congressional Committee's annual spring dinner on Tuesday. There, he took some credit for originating the now-iconic slogan ""Make America Great Again"" (MAGA).
“They were saying it was the greatest theme in the history of politics,” he said, wondering aloud if MAGA should morph into Keep America Great.
“How do you give that up for a new one? KAGA. KAGA. Everything’s MAGA. Even when I do a tweet -- that has kept us in business, those tweets. It's the only form of defense because the press is 94 percent against us,” he said.
He said he came up with MAGA slogan himself.
On another note, Trump told House Republicans their time in the minority is not going to last long.
Trump said: “We’re going to take back the House. We are.”
Democrats hold a 235-197 majority in the House, with three vacancies.
The Democrats found success in the November elections by attracting support from women, people of color and college-educated voters, particularly in suburban districts.
Trump said tax cuts and his work on trade deals would bolster the GOP in 2020.

Indonesia: Amien Rais Threatens ‘People Power’ at Slightest Hint of Voter Fraud,www.centennialasia.com,admin,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.centennialasia.com/the-asian-pulse/daily-news/indonesia-amien-rais-threatens-people-power-at-slightest-hint-of-voter-fraud/,"No Comments With only two weeks left until Indonesia’s presidential election on 17 Apr 19, it is only natural for supporters of both presidential nominees—current president Joko “Jokowi” Widodo and his rival, ex-army general Prabowo Subianto—to ramp up their rhetoric. But the latest salvo from Prabowo’s camp may have just gone more than a little over the top. Hashim Djojohadikusumo, communications director for Prabowo’s campaign team, told reporters in Jakarta on that they will challenge the outcome if the former general loses the poll to incumbent Joko Widodo. As many as 18.8 million names on the electoral roll may be fraudulent or inaccurate, he said. There are “serious questions about how the election is being run,” said Djojohadikusumo, who is also Prabowo’s brother. Former People’s Consultative Assembly chairman and senior opposition leader Amien Rais on 31 Mar 19 threatened to organize a mass protest at the slightest hint of voter fraud during the presidential election, declaring that he will rely on “people power” to protest rather than going to the Constitutional Court. His statement came during a rally dubbed “Apel Siaga 313” attended by members of the Indonesian Muslim Forum (FUI) and Islamic Defenders Front (FPI), who marched from the Sunda Kelapa mosque to the nearby General Elections Commission (KPU) office to call on opposition supporters to closely monitor election proceedings and prevent voter fraud from happening. Constitutional Court spokesman Fajar Laksono said he regretted Amien’s remarks. Fajar said Amien’s statement might cast doubt on all the work they had put to in to improve public trust on the Constitutional Court and could be considered as contempt of court. He also pointed out that when he was chairman of the People’s Consultative Assembly, Amien actually took part in establishing the Constitutional Court. The Election Supervisory Board (Bawaslu) considered Amien’s plan to mobilize “people power” as “illegitimate.” Bawaslu official Rahmat Bagja said the 2017 Election Law stipulates that the Constitutional Court holds the final say on electoral disputes."

On 2 Apr 19, the Supreme Court quashed the RBI’s 12 Feb 18 circular, putting a 180-day deadline to refer bad loan accounts over INR?20bn to the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC). The apex court order was in response to a petition filed by power producers in Aug 18, challenging the constitutional validity of the RBI circular. The central bank is unlikely to challenge the SC order. The RBI has to come up with specific guidelines for industries and not a general direction. RBI will announce its monetary policy decision on 4 Apr 19. Lawyers, however, believe that SC’s judgement will not affect cases filed before the 12 Feb 19 circular was announced. In other words, this ruling will not affect the 12 cases, such as those of Essar Steel."

Mr Thanathorn also posted a picture of the summons issued by the Royal Thai Police Office 29 Mar 19. The document named his accuser as Col Burin Thongprapai, a legal officer of the NCPO. It did not refer to any particular act of alleged sedition. He said the alleged offence was brought under Section 116 of the Criminal Code, saying that he wondered when he committed this alleged offence. In the past year, he wrote, he had met people nationwide. Mr Thanathorn wrote that it was clear that an old-fashioned political game not only refuses to stop after the election but also intensifies, because the opponents are afraid of Future Forward and the unexpected victory of so many people. He added that he would meet police as ordered and prove his innocence. He believed millions of people would support him and would not bow to the “dark power” that wanted to destroy his party."

President Trump has forcefully stated that America will never become a socialist country and now that special counsel Robert Mueller has cleared him of colluding with Russia, he is taking the fight directly to the enemy.
With Democrats moving to fully embrace ideas that have resulted in misery ruination and repression in every society in which they have been implemented, the president is all that stands between America and a bleak socialist future thanks to the far left extremists that control the opposition party.
The undisputed leader of the push for socialism is 29-year-old firebrand Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez who has mesmerized millennials, bamboozled the media and terrorized members of her own party into falling in line or risk being attacked by the social media mob that she commands.
VOTER POLL: Do you oppose AOC’s Green New Deal?
Despite her youth and inexperience, AOC is arguably the most powerful member of Congress and few would dare to cross the vindictive princess and her insane policy proposals like the Green New Deal or face her wrath.
Trump has largely ignored Ocasio-Cortez throughout her period of political ascendance but that all changed on Tuesday when like a matador taunting a bull, he waved the red cape by referring to the freshman rep as “a young bartender” who her party is “petrified” of.

Via The Hill, “Trump mocks Green New Deal as done by ‘young bartender’ Ocasio-Cortez” :
President Trump mocked Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) on Tuesday night over the Green New Deal, an ambitious proposal she crafted to combat climate change.
Trump told House GOP lawmakers at the National Republican Congressional Committee dinner that he didn’t want to be too critical of the Green New Deal because he hoped to campaign against it. He went on to chide Ocasio-Cortez without explicitly naming her.
“The Green New Deal, done by a young bartender, 29 years old,” Trump said, eliciting laughter from attendees.
“A young bartender, wonderful young woman,” he continued. “The Green New Deal. The first time I heard it I said, ‘That’s the craziest thing.’ You have senators that are professionals that you guys know that have been there for a long time … and they’re standing behind her shaking. They’re petrified of her.”
Trump also warned not to underestimate the appeal of socialism and its disastrous consequences. President Trump warns about socialism in the 2020 elections:

House duo pushes to let news outlets band together against Facebook and Google,thehill.com,hneidig@thehill.com (Harper Neidig),04-03-2019,2019,4,https://thehill.com/policy/technology/437072-house-duo-pushes-to-let-news-outlets-band-together-against-facebook-and,"House duo pushes to let news outlets band together against Facebook and Google By Harper Neidig - 04/03/19 09:10 AM EDT
A bipartisan pair of House leaders want to let news outlets join together to negotiate with Facebook and Google for a greater share of online ad revenue.
Douglas (Doug) Allen Collins House panel to vote Wednesday on authorizing subpoena for Mueller report Dems stand firm on early April deadline for Mueller report GOP lawmaker releases Papadopoulos transcript MORE (R-Ga.) introduced a bill Wednesday morning that would grant publishers a waiver from antitrust laws in order to engage in collective bargaining with internet giants.
“The free press is a cornerstone of our democracy,” Cicilline said in a statement. “Journalists keep the public informed, root out corruption, and hold the powerful accountable. This bill will provide a much-needed lifeline to local publishers who have been crushed by Google and Facebook. It’s about time we take a stand on this issue.” ADVERTISEMENT
Critics of Facebook and Google have argued that the companies’ stranglehold on the digital advertising market has shrunk the amount of ad revenue left for media outlets, making it nearly impossible for local newspapers to survive.
The two companies combined took in about 58 percent of all internet ad revenue generated in 2018, according to an analysis by eMarketer.
Cicilline, the chairman of the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust and an outspoken critic of the internet giants, introduced the Journalism Competition and Preservation Act last year, but with no Republicans in the GOP-held House on board, the bill went nowhere.
Now that Collins, the top Judiciary Republican, has signed on, the bill may find greater momentum.
“Community journalism holds a critical place in our democracy because it helps the American people understand and engage in civil society,” Collins said in a statement. “Through our bipartisan legislation, we are opening the door for community newspapers to more fairly negotiate with large tech platforms that are operating in an increasingly anti-competitive space. This will help protect journalism, promote competition and allow communities to stay informed.”"
Here Is The Striking Discovery From Bloomberg's Investigation Of YouTube,www.zerohedge.com,Tyler Durden,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2019-04-02/rogue-youtube-employee-discovers-something-amazing-about-alt-right-content,"0 SHARES
According to a lengthy investigation by Bloomberg on Google's struggle to maximize profit while addressing calls to censor 'toxic' material, a rogue employee decided to ignore the advice of corporate attorneys and created a new ""vertical"" category to internally track so-called ""alt-right"" content - described as ""the political ensemble loosely tied to Trump.""
What they found was fascinating; alt-right videos are an absolute monster category for the video-hosting platform, right up with ""music, sports and gaming"" as the most popular.
One telling moment happened around early 2018, according to two people familiar with it. An employee decided to create a new YouTube “vertical,” a category that the company uses to group its mountain of video footage. This person gathered together videos under an imagined vertical for the “alt-right,” the political ensemble loosely tied to Trump. Based on engagement, the hypothetical alt-right category sat with music, sports and gaming as the most popular channels at YouTube , an attempt to show how critical these videos were to YouTube’s business. - Bloomberg
Three days after the 2016 US election, YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki and her staff convened for their weekly meeting, where one employee ""fretted aloud about the site's election-related videos that were watched the most,"" as they were ""dominated by publishers like Breitbart News and Infowars, which were known for outrage and provocation.""
Obviously providing a watering hole for conservatives - which Bloomberg and Google can't help but associate with 'toxic' content - is highly profitable. On social media platform Reddit , pro-Trump forum "" The_Donald "" is roughly the 264th largest ""subreddit"" by size, while ranked #3 in terms of user activity on the site, according to "" redditlist .""
YouTube, meanwhile, has been trying to figure out how to properly pay content ""creators"" who were growing frustrated over the pay structure. To meet the challenge, the company would pitch an overhaul of their entire business model which would revolve around ""engagement"" - how many people watched a video, and for how long. They called it ""Project Bean.""
Wojcicki and her lieutenants drew up a plan. YouTube called it Project Bean or, at times, “Boil The Ocean,” to indicate the enormity of the task. (Sometimes they called it BTO3 – a third dramatic overhaul for YouTube, after initiatives to boost mobile viewing and subscriptions.) The plan was to rewrite YouTube’s entire business model, according to three former senior staffers who worked on it.
It centered on a way to pay creators that isn’t based on the ads their videos hosted. Instead, YouTube would pay on engagement—how many viewers watched a video and how long they watched . A special algorithm would pool incoming cash, then divvy it out to creators, even if no ads ran on their videos. The idea was to reward video stars shorted by the system, such as those making sex education and music videos, which marquee advertisers found too risqué to endorse . - Bloomberg
YouTube's ambitious overhaul had some unintended consequences; by rewarding videos that achieved popularity by outrage - someone like Alex Jones would become one of YouTube's highest paid stars.
Ultimately, Google CEO Sundar Pichai ditched project bean because ""he felt it could make the filter bubble problem worse,"" according to Bloomberg .
More highlights from the investigation: Susan Wojcicki and other YouTube executives were either unable or unwilling to act on internal warnings about extreme and misleading videos because they were too focused on increasing viewing time and other measures of engagement. Wojcicki would “never put her fingers on the scale,” according to one person who worked for her. When Wojcicki took over YouTube in 2014, she embraced a target of one billion hours of daily watch time. The service hit that goal in October 2016. A privacy engineer at Google suggested to YouTube’s policy chief that videos deemed “close to the line” of the takedown policy should be removed from recommendations . The proposal was turned down and YouTube doubled down on an AI-powered strategy to use recommendations to keep people watching. YouTube recently replaced engagement with ""responsible growth"" as its core metric. But the company has yet to explain publicly what that metric entails and how it will affect its business. YouTube dissuaded staff from being proactive. Lawyers advised employees not assigned to handle moderation to avoid searching on their own for questionable videos. Exclusive data from Moonshot CVE, a London research firm, shows that less than 20 YouTube channels pushing anti-vaccination theories built an audience of more than 170 million people over a decade . YouTube recommended those viewers more conspiracies in the last year. Tags "

“Will someone rid me of this troublesome priest.. ”
This morning breakfast was Avocado on Toast, with a poached egg on top. It was lovely. I pity my poor American chums. Who would have thought their economic dream is about to come crashing down. Within days ravening hordes of angry snowflake millennials will be tearing down the state – all because 100% of America’s Avocados are imported from Mexico at this time of year.
Is closing the border to the South going to prove Trump’s biggest mistake?
4 Things to think about this morning:
What is really happening in US Treasuries – good or bad for stocks? The Fed and Trump – should we be concerned The real market threat – liquidity. Italy. Have a strong expresso and wake up. First , Let start with US Treasuries.
I don’t buy the yield curve inversion means economic disaster scenario. As other’s have noted: curve inversions have predicted 12 of the last 3 recessions. I’m going with the world has fundamentally changed after years of monetary experimentation and distortion. I reckon expectations of a lower for longer Fed will continue to fuel the long-end of market. Treasury bond action has been fascinating: The 10-year has risen from 2.37% back to 2.51% over 5 days on the back of stronger Economic Data signals and rumours a China/US trade deal is “just about done”, only partially reversing the rally from 3.34% since November.
The interesting thing has been 10-year trading in a steady 2.60-2.80% range since Jan/Feb. What caused yields to spike downwards in March – especially after a dovish Fed meeting? It looks to have been technical: a surge in swap activity to support new issues and mortgage convexity hedging, investors short-covering and taking derivatives to boost returns impacted by lower yields, but also a reaction to the Fed in terms of Vol hedges. In short, complex, but not end of the world stuff.
Where does that leave US stocks? Well distorted; fuelled by last year’s Trump tax cuts, a “compliant Fed” keeping rates easy and the market’s rapid recovery from the December min-crash sucking players back in. There are warning signs all around – like the 5% plus slide in US auto-sales, the 9% of US Mall spaces now unlet and the warnings of potential meltdown in over-levered private equity from a former Bain partner – but that’s just noise. Is it distorted enough for another crash? Watch that space…
The IMF’s Christine Lagarde has been publicising her big conference next week with warnings of an unsettled global economy and economic slowdown – downgrading growth for the next two years -while the World Bank is also cutting projections. She said: “ two year ago 75% of the global economy experienced upswing. This year, we expect 70% to experience a slowdown.” Although we hear the trade Sherpas talk up rumours the trade discussions are progressing, it feels like global trade is becoming less more and more subject to dispute. I can’t see any signs of positive sentiment re global trade flows between US/China and US/Europe – that can’t be good news?
Second , that brings us on to Trump and the Fed.
I’ve been told a couple of times I’m an idiot for thinking Trump has any influence over the Fed. If he did, then it would break the key fundamental of the US Economic Fairy Story – that the Central Bank and State are entirely separate. But there is a distinct feel of “murder in the cathedral” as Trump’s “Guess I’m stuck with you” comments and apparent fury with Jerome Powell raise the temperature. The one truism about US politics is: “its all about the economy, stupid”, and Trump is clearly set to blame an unsupportive Fed if the US economy slows into election year.
That’s potentially one of the most dangerous moments I can imagine? The global economy losing trust in a beleaguered Fed. The comments Trump is making, including “Mnuchin gave me this guy,” and others, might sound classic Trump rudeness, but there is a great article in the WSJ detailing how he blasted the central bank and its leader at three meetings in the past week alone . This is something the market should keep a close eye on.
Third , the next issue is the biggest threat to markets.. Liquidity
We’re all aware market making across all asset classes is a complete liquidity illusion. Everything is agency brokerage these days. Anyone buying bonds or stocks on the basis of perceived liquidity is very aware they are simply arbing the rules and meeting their CRO’s risk profile tick-boxes. (If they sincerely believe they are choosing assets on the basis of liquidity, get them off the desk before they do something downright stupid.)
There are a couple of ways to play liquidity – one is to take the illiquidity premium and hope for the best by riding through any liquidity crisis. It’s why Alternative assets work. Or, you can try to manage illiquidity risk.
The numbers all confirm bond inventories held by dealers are a fraction of pre-2007. Yet one of the most successful growth stories in fixed income has been the growth of fixed income ETFs. I’m a supporter – as part of a FI strategy not based on being able to rely on guaranteed liquidity. The issue is what happens in a period of crisis and investors try to exit Fixed Income ETFs at Net Asset Value?
Bond markets, because of their discrete nature, are not fungible like equity, and bond ETF unwinds will depend on the appetite of the appointed deals to accept trades where they effectively unwind a portfolio and sell the component parts – they are not obligated to do so. While everyone knows a single bond can become illiquid, what happens when a portfolio of bonds tries to trade in illiquid markets? Do they become even less liquid (illiquidity squared?). Nope, they get discounted further!
The trick is again being able to ride through illiquidity on a buy-to-hold-basis. I’d actually recommend picking up discounted ETFs in a time of crisis on the basis markets tend to revert, and a portfolio approach works in bonds. The question, however, as always, is timing. What is the right time, following a market crash and fire sale of ETFs, to step in an buy that Hi-yield or EM ETF?
Fourth , let’s talk about Italy.
Yes, I know its been a superb performing asset class on the basis the new government made all sort of promises to the EU and ECB about cutting deficits and reducing bond issuance so that it stuck within EU guidelines. Imagine my shock and surprise to discover the planned cuts haven’t happened, the deficit financing is rising (partly because the economy continues to contract) and that Italy is once again on a crash course with the EU.
If you are surprised.. then no amount of strong coffee is going to help you."
US Auto Sales Wrap Up Terrible First Quarter with Dismal March Numbers,www.zerohedge.com,Tyler Durden,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2019-04-03/us-auto-sales-wrap-terrible-first-quarter-dismal-march-numbers,"0 SHARES
Auto sales in the U.S. wrapped up an ugly first quarter with dismal results for the month of March as the buying frenzy from last year’s tax cuts wore off and the economy continues to decelerate. Of the sales data that was reported for the month, Honda was the only major automaker that didn't see a year-over-year sales decline. Here's how some of the bigger name manufacturers ended the month: General Motors saw deliveries drop 7% for the quarter , with all four brands falling Chevy Silverado was down 16% Chevy Suburban dropped 25% Fiat Chrysler sales fell 7.3% (estimates were for a decline of 6.4%) Jeep sales fell 11%, continuing the February trend of SUV demand drying up Toyota sales fell 3.5% This beat estimates for the month, but still showed softness Toyota also fell 5% for the first quarter, hurt by a decline in demand for its Corolla Nissan sales were down 5.3% in March Nissan's first quarter sales were down 11.6% Deliveries fell 23% for its Infiniti brand Ford sales were down 5% in March, according to industry data The company is expected to show a 2% decline for the quarter Honda saw a 4.3% percent increase, as passenger car sales rose more than 4%. Accord sales were up 5%
""The industry had a tough first quarter but with spring finally starting to show its face and continued strong economic indicators, such as a boost in housing sales, lower lending rates and a strong labor market, we are confident that new vehicle sales demand will strengthen going forward,"" Fiat Chrysler's U.S. head of sales, Reid Bigland, said, and m aybe if he keeps repeating that, it will eventually come true...
""While some of our competitors are abandoning sedans, we remain optimistic about the future of the segment, "" Toyota said in a statement. As above, good luck with that, Toyota.
Both Ford and GM no longer announce monthly sales data - for obvious reasons - but Ford is slated to release its first quarter numbers this Thursday. Estimates have pinned the automaker to a 2% decline for the quarter. The whisper number is lower.
The seasonally adjusted, annualized rate of sales is forecast to come in at 16.8 million, based on a survey of 12 analysts. While that would be up from February's 16.61 million rate, it is still well below the 17.33 million pace set in March 2018.
Most notably most analysts forecast that industry sales this year will slip below 17 million for the first time in nearly five years, as higher rates, lower rebates, a deteriorating economy and rising prices continue to suffocate consumer demand.
Jessica Caldwell, executive director of industry analysis at Edmunds said : “Things just keep getting tougher for new-car shoppers. Interest rates have crept up every month so far this year, and new vehicle prices continue to hover near record highs. We’re on the cusp of what could be a pretty dramatic shift in the market, simply because a big chunk of buyers are getting priced out. ”
We warned about slowing Jeep sales being a potential ""canary in the coalmine"" for the already struggling industry back in early March:
The fact that Jeep sales have slowed is a warning indicator that the SUV ""boom"" in the U.S. could be coming to an end. Mired by higher interest rates and continued tightening of credit, buyers are forcing once record high SUV sales and prices back down again. As a result, Fiat's Jeep Wrangler sales fell 5.9% in the month, as inventory continued to pile up at dealerships. Fiat joined companies like Toyota, Honda and Nissan, as virtually every OEM both missed analyst estimates for the month and posted an annual sales decline.
In February, auto sales plunged to 18 month lows as SUV demand hit a brick wall. SUVs were, until this February, one of the sole remaining bright spots in the rapidly slowing U.S. auto market. Despite the fact that they were crippling traditional sedan sales, Americans' transition to SUVs was seen as a silver lining, prompting many automakers to make infrastructure changes to account for the change in demand. That silver lining looks to have all but completely disappeared at this point.
In January, auto companies set the tone for the year, starting 2019 just as miserably as 2018 ended, with major double digit plunges in sales from manufacturers like Nissan and Daimler. Tags"
Tories Declare 'Civil War' As May Prepares For Opposition Talks,www.zerohedge.com,Tyler Durden,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2019-04-03/tories-declare-civil-war-may-prepares-opposition-talks,"0 SHARES
After walking out of a previous round of cross-party talks, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has again agreed to meet with Prime Minister Theresa May after the PM said during a speech on Tuesday that she had no choice but to seek a deal with the opposition, effectively ensuring that Labour wouldn't escape blame should Brexit go off the rails.
Unsurprisingly, Brexiteers and the DUP have interpreted May's decision as a declaration of war, and are already screeching about her unforgivable betrayal. Offering one of the most colorful Brexit-related comments we've seen, an anonymous Tory MP compared May to Voldemort, the evil wizard who murdered Harry Potter's parents in the popular children's series, while speaking with a reporter from the national radio show TalkRadio. Tory source on PM pivoting to Labour: “It’s getting like the bit in Harry Potter where Voldermort’s soul breaks apart. She is now tearing apart the soul of the party. She has split the soul into a Labour horcrux.” — Ross Kempsell (@rosskempsell) April 3, 2019
The flogging from backbenchers continued during Wednesday's PMQs, but others defended her decision. Tory MP Oliver Letwin, the mastermind of the two failed indicative votes, said Corbyn was somebody May could ""work with"", in a clear rebuke to the Brexiteers who have opposed May's deal at every turn.
During a speech last night, May acknowledged what the public has long suspected: That winning the support of the DUP and ERG has proved impossible, and that her only option is to seek a deal with the opposition. If May can't hash out a deal with Labour, she said she would accept any Brexit plan that curried the strongest majority in an indicative parliamentary vote (though, the two indicative votes held so far have failed to produce any alternatives with a clear majority of support). The EU has reportedly indicated that it would be open to such a deal, and that it might also be amenable to a longer Brexit delay with ""strict conditions"" like participating in the EU Parliamentary elections.
Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay told Parliament on Wednesday that May doesn't intend to ask for a long extension (though he did leave open the possibility). Barclay added that he thinks a customs union is ""highly undesirable"". The DUP, meanwhile, has accused May of ""subcontracting"" Brexit to Labour.
Speculation is swirling about what a May-Corbyn accord might look like. Most suspect that it will include continued membership in the customs union (a violation of one of May's ""red lines"", though she likely won't compromise on free movement of people).
Already, another junior government minister has resigned in protest over talks with the opposition. Nigel Adams, minister for Wales and assistant government whip, said these talks were a ""grave error."" Following yesterday’s cabinet, this morning I’ve been to Downing Street & resigned my position as UK Govt Minister for Wales & Govt Whip. I’m grateful to the PM for the opportunity to serve as a Minister since 2017 & will continue to serve my constituents from the backbenches. pic.twitter.com/W15xS4cOBP — Nigel Adams MP (@nadams) April 3, 2019
Though the pound has rallied on a sense of renewed optimism - after all, if nothing else, it appears May has at least finally decided to stop banging her head against a wall by trying to rally support for the withdrawal agreement - analysts from Rabobank said the cross-party talks could cause both the Tories and Labour to implode.
May has now saying that she can’t get Brexit through with Tory votes, so she thinks she can do it with Labour backing. How are the Tories going to react to that?! It almost guarantees that the party implodes. Jeremy Corbyn, who faces the same threat in his own party, has already responded by saying: ”Labour has put forward our proposals to ensure there is a customs union with the EU, access to vital markets and protections of our standards of consumer, environmental and workers’ rights.
And we’ll ensure that those are on the table. We’re also very clear that there has to be an absolute guarantee that the Good Friday Agreement is maintained for peace in Northern Ireland.” That means the softest of Brexits, because it requires staying in the Customs Union and the Single Market, which is the EEA/Norway option which has already been rejected twice. Or might the compromise be to offer a second referendum? And will the EU really be willing to sign a deal with the UK that is contingent on that outcome later? Is it really any wonder the EU’s Barnier is warning that No Deal looms and is more and more likely? GBP might be rallying, but dream on, dream on unless the EU-27 are happy to play along with this latest Brexit twist.
After being bombarded with questions about Corbyn's intentions and competence, as well as her willingness to accept 'no deal' over a 'bad deal', during PMQs, May said her initial talks with Corbyn would focus on areas ""where we both agree.""
She added that Wednesday's meeting with Corbyn will focus on looking at the areas that they both agree on. Though both Labour and Tory MPs will be focusing on whether the prospect of a second referendum was included in the discussions.
""I think we both want to deliver leaving the EU with a deal. I think we both want to protect jobs. I think we both want to ensure that we end free movement. I think we both recognize the importance of the Withdrawal Agreement,"" May told lawmakers.
That may or may not be true. But whatever happens, we should be hearing more soon enough. May is expected to meet with Corbyn at 2:30 pm London Time - or 10:30 am ET. Tags"
"""Synchronized Global Growth Has Collapsed"": Why Deutsche Just Downgraded Caterpillar",www.zerohedge.com,Tyler Durden,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2019-04-03/db-downgrades-caterpillar-synchronized-global-growth-has-collapsed,"0 SHARES
In a world where Caterpillar is considered a global industrial bellwether and a key indicator of economic inflection points, then today's downgrade of Caterpillar by Deutsche Bank is a harbinger that the recent risk on euphoria may be coming to an end.
Shares of the industrial giant fell after Deutsche Bank downgraded CAT to Hold from Buy, slashing its price target on CAT from $152 to $128: Explaining his rationale, DB's Chad Dillard said that ""we are adjusting our 2019 EPS from $12.41 to $11.80 (vs. guide of $11.75-$12.75 and street of $12.22) and our 2020 EPS from $13.48 to $10.40 (vs. street of $13.06) to reflect our lowered expectations for global growth. We value CAT on 6.5x our 2019 EBITDA for ME&T (vs. 7.5x previously, with the shift reflecting our updated view that we are at peak) and assign a 1.5x price to book value for the FinCo to arrive at our $128 price target.""
Revealing what he thinks is the biggest risk to the bull case for CAT, Dillard says is if CAT's ""backlog growth turns negative and it is becoming increasingly clear that it will within this next quarter."" In fact, DB sees the company's backlog going negative in the next 3 months:
As he further explains, ""negative backlog growth historically precedes a negative earnings revision cycle by 3 months. During these cycles, street estimates get typically get cut by 45% and shares fall by 40% from the peak."" Some more details:
Our proprietary Global Growth Model is a 6-9-month leading indicator for CAT’s backlog growth, which is likely to turn negative in the next 3 months. As of 4Q18, CAT’s backlog was up 4%, but slowing global growth is likely to lead to a decline of 10% in 1Q19 and turn more negative in 2H19. The key takeaway here is that CAT’s 2019 numbers are at risk regardless of what happens from sentiment perspective (trade deal, better China data, etc.) - it will still take another 6-9 months for this improved sentiment to convert into sales for CAT.
And visually:
In terms of actual macro drivers, Dilllard says that "" synchronized global growth has collapsed, the China Land Cycle is rolling over (and will continue to weaken despite the single positive data point this week), Europe is slowing more than expected and the US is oversaturated with construction equipment. Each of these factors alone are powerful drivers of CAT’s earnings, but together this synchronized slowdown will not only usher in a negative earnings revision cycle, but also make 2019 the cyclical peak.""
As a result of the rising headlines, Dillard predicts that ""Street numbers for 2019 and 2020 are 5% and 20% too high, but the current share price does not reflect this reality."" And while Deutsche Bank acknowledges management ""has done a tremendous job improving cross-cycle earnings power and the balance sheet optionality is impressive, we fear these positives are already priced in and the oncoming down-cycle is too powerful to overcome.""
As such, we view the risk/reward as balanced and downgrade CAT from Buy to Hold and update our price target to $128.
Breaking down the key risks, Deutsche Bank lists 4 factors that CAT's earnings are at a cyclical peak...
... including:
1)Synchronized Global Growth Has Collapsed (55% of CAT’s sales are ex-US) – our proprietary model shows the level of global growth synchronization falling from 80% last year, to <15% in 1Q19. This model is a 6 month forward predictor of CAT’s backlog growth, which we project will decline by +10% in 1Q19 and become more negative through the year, and has historically trended with CAT’s share price (though the relationship decoupled in 1Q, with CAT shares up 10%, and our model down 15%);
2) The China Land Cycle Is Rolling Over (45% of CAT’s (in)direct sales) – China land sales volumes are at a cyclical peak (up 35% from trough vs. +25% historically), the rate of change (a consistent directional predictor) has gone negative and a down-cycle in land results in a 30% decline and takes 24 months to trough. Land Sales are a 2-9 month forward predictor of CAT equipment demand, so the recent slowdown has not fully reached CAT’s sales.
The slowing land cycle in China poses an outsized risk to CAT. Judging by historical measures, the China land cycle is at the peak. Land sales volumes are up 35% from the prior trough (vs. a historical 25% increase) and Y/Y growth recently turned negative (down mid-single digits in the last month). Land sales volumes typically trough 30% below the peak and take 2 years to get there. If we use this framework, it would suggest there is further to go in this down cycle, which poses an outsized risk to CAT.
3) Europe is Slowing More Than Expected (25% of CAT sales) – the street is expecting MSD growth in 2019, but region is more likely to decline by HSD. Europe PMI is a 4-quarter forward predictor of CAT”s EAME sales and this data point points to negative growth starting in 2Q19;
The street expects CAT’s Europe business (25% of sales) to grow by 5% in 2019, but we see downside risk and expect sales to decline by mid to high single digits, presenting 20c of downside risk to street numbers. The Europe PMI is a 4-quarter lead indicator for sales growth and it turned negative last year, which would suggest sales turns negative starting in 2Q19 (down form mid single digit growth in 1Q19). For 2020, sales could be down closer to 10% vs. street expectation of 10%, which implies 60c of downside risk to consensus EPS.
4) The US is Oversaturated With Construction Equipment (20% of sales) – equipment spending as a % of GDP is at a 40-year high and historically sales.
The US is rapidly becoming oversaturated with construction equipment, which represents 20% of CAT’s sales. CAT’s US construction business is likely to be down 10-15% in 2020 (vs. street of down 3%). US equipment spending as a % of GDP has hit a 30 year high of 33bps. Historically, after hitting these peak levels, sales have declined by 17% in year 1 of the downturn and by 25% in year 2. Also, we are starting to pick up a few negative data points already this year: customer delays of rental equipment delivery, CNHI under-producing demand in 2019, DE posting a retail sales decline last month), negative readings in the ABI/Dodge Momentum index. If CAT’s equipment sales are down 10-25% next year, then it could pose 35c-95c of downside risk to 2020 earnings.
DB's macro bottom line was that within its coverage universe, ""CAT is one of the stocks most sensitive to weakening international growth. CAT has a 0.77 correlation with our proprietary Global Growth Model. Also, it has the highest exposure to international sales (ex. ag equipment), which represents 55% of CAT’s sales.""
And since global growth is crumbling, it is only a matter of time before CAT stock follows.
Finally, Dillard lists 5 points that the bulls are missing, which are as follows: On our numbers, CAT’s multiple is closer to mid-cycle than it should be– CAT trades at ~14x on our 2020 EPS (10% below the 15x mid cycle multiple), but with 60% of its end markets past mid cycle, it should trade at a 25-30% discount to midcycle; Positioning may be more bullish than the market appreciates – the % of sell-side rating CAT a buy is near multi-year highs at 60%, while the % short interest is near multi year lows at 1.8% of float; Although CAT’s cross-cycle earnings power has doubled, it does not provide enough downside protection – trough earnings is likely in the $7 range (factoring in $12B of buybacks to account for balance sheet optionality), but the market is unlikely to assign a 20x trough multiple to an untested trough EPS (17-18x more likely, which suggests 10-15% downside); The balance sheet optionality is tremendous, but the benefit is priced in – we estimate CAT has $7B of excess cash (worth $9/sh of equity value) and if we add this value to our base case price $118 (10x our 2019 EPS of $11.80) we get fair value of ~$127 (10% below the current price); The path to getting paid by owning CAT is long and complex – to get to our 15% upside scenario we need to assume CAT hits the guidance midpoint (no negative backlog growth), the trade situation gets solved in the near term and it fully deploys its excess balance sheet
While DB's points are all accurate, the market appears to be discounting almost everything he said and the stock is barely lower in premarket trading, down only 50 cents, and still trading at the highest level it has since last October. Tags"
"ADP Shows Weakest Job Gains Since Sept 2017 As Manufacturing, Construction Shrink",www.zerohedge.com,Tyler Durden,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2019-04-03/adp-shows-weakest-job-gains-sept-2017-manufacturing-construction-shrink,"0 SHARES
Following last month's weak ADP print which front-ran the dismal ""must be an outlier due to weather, shutdown, or anything else"" payrolls data, expectations were for a slightly weaker ADP employment headline in March.
However, despite the apparent emergence of 'green shoots' around the world, ADP disappointed, adding just 129k jobs in March (well below the expected +175k and only just above the 125k lowest estimate of analysts). This is the weakest growth in employment since Sept 2017...
Under the hood, Small businesses shrank their employee base, as Construction lost 6k jobs...
“March posted the slowest employment increase in 18 months,” said Ahu Yildirmaz, vice president and co-head of the ADP Research Institute.
“Although some service sectors showed continued strength, we saw weakness in the goods producing sector.”
Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody’s Analytics, said, “The job market is weakening, with employment gains slowing significantly across most industries and company sizes .""
""Businesses are hiring cautiously as the economy is struggling with fading fiscal stimulus, the trade uncertainty, and the lagged impact of Fed tightening. If employment growth weakens much further, unemployment will begin to rise .”
Zandi is not wrong - after 26 straight months of manufacturing jobs gains, March saw shrinkage... Tags"
