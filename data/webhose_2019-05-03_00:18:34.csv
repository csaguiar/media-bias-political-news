Equity Residential (NYSE:EQR) was downgraded by Zacks Investment Research from a “hold” rating to a “sell” rating in a research report issued on Monday, Zacks.com reports.
According to Zacks, “Shares of Equity Residential have underperformed its industry, over the past month. Further, the trend in estimate revisions of funds from operations (FFO) per share for 2019 does not indicate a favorable outlook. Although economic recovery and job-market growth, favorable demographics, lifestyle transformation, and creation of households have the capacity to drive demand, new apartment supply across its markets is expected to continue, putting pressure on new lease rates, occupancy and retention and lead to use of high concessions as well. Further, in a bid to reposition its portfolio, the company is opting for substantial sale of non-core assets. The dilutive impact on earnings from such dispositions cannot be averted in the near term. Nonetheless, rewarding its shareholders, the company announced 5.1% sequential hike in common stock dividends this March.” Get Equity Residential alerts:

Source: AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana Trending The Admission Scam Is Another Reason To Destroy Academia As We Know It
Last week, former Vice President Joe Biden spoke at the Biden Courage Awards ceremony in preparation for his presidential campaign launch. There, in an attempt to forestall claims that as a white man, he simply isn't intersectional enough to compete in the Democratic primaries, he critiqued a central pillar of Western civilization as inherently racist. ""Back in the late 1300s, so many women were dying at the hands of their husbands because they were chattel, just like the cattle, or the sheep, that the court of common law decided they had to do something about the extent of the deaths,"" Biden fibbed. ""So you know what they said? No man has a right to chastise his woman with a rod thicker than the circumference of his thumb. This is English jurisprudential culture, a white man's culture. It's got to change. It's got to change.""
Biden's take was, as always, historically illiterate. The ""rule of thumb"" story has been circulating for years -- and it has been repeatedly debunked. There was no ""rule of thumb,"" as feminist scholar Christina Hoff Sommers points out. ""On the contrary,"" she writes, ""British law since the 1700s and our American laws predating the Revolution prohibit wife beating."" In actuality, the phrase originated in craftsmen so expert that they could perform tasks without precise measuring tools. View Cartoon
More importantly, however, Biden's characterization of ""English jurisprudential culture"" as ""white man's culture"" is profoundly disturbing. English jurisprudential culture is rooted in the belief in the rule of law, due process of law, equal rights under law; English jurisprudential culture is responsible for preserving the natural rights we hold dear, rights which were imperfectly but increasingly extended over time to more and more human beings, particularly minorities. No less a leftist figure than Barack Obama explained just that in 2009, saying he sought a system at Guantanamo Bay that ""adheres to the rule of law, habeas corpus, basic principles of Anglo-American legal system.""
Protection of individual rights -- and in particular, minority rights -- lies at the heart of English jurisprudence. Yet Biden boiled down those rights to racial privilege. And the attempt to reduce the fundamental principles of our civilization to a mask for racial hierarchical power is both false and frightening. It suggests that those principles ought to be undermined for purposes of disestablishing that supposed hierarchy. Get rid of English jurisprudential law, presumably, in order to fight racism. Recommended After This Onstage Remark, Joe Biden 2020 Should Be Canceled Matt Vespa
Ironically, reduction of Western civilization to racial supremacy isn't just a strategy of the intersectional left; it's a strategy of the despicable alt-right, which champions Western civilization as white civilization and then seeks to rip away the universalism of its principles from nonwhite people. Thus, the very term ""Western civilization"" is under assault by a variety of political forces seeking to tear out eternal truths and natural rights in the name of tribalism.
But that's not what Western civilization is about at all. Western civilization was built on Judeo-Christian values and Greek reason, culminating in a perspective on natural rights that is preserved by institutions like English jurisprudence. It is thanks to those philosophical principles that free markets, free speech and free association have grown and flourished. Only if we re-enshrine those principles, rather than undermine them, will our prosperity and freedoms be preserved. "

Its role is not to take sides on contested geopolitical issues,”“I have been steadfast in my view that Brown should not embrace any of the planks of the BDS (Boycott, Divest, Sanctions) movement,” she added.

WASHINGTON — Two former homeland security secretaries will co-chair a task force convened by national Jewish organizations aimed at tracking anti-religious violence. The task force, announced Tuesday, is a joint project of the Anti-Defamation League and Secure Community Network, a Jewish self-defense initiative.Its co-chairs are Jeh Johnson, the Homeland Security secretary under President Barack Obama, and Michael Chertoff, who held the job under President George W. Bush, and who is Jewish.The initiative arose after the attack on a Pittsburgh synagogue complex in October that killed 11 Jewish worshippers, the worst anti-Jewish attack in U.S. history.“The task force will develop best practices to increase coordination and cooperation related to incident tracking, information sharing, reporting and addressing threats,” a joint ADL-SCN release said.The Trump administration’s Homeland Security Department recently disbanded an intelligence unit that tracked right-wing violence, drawing criticism from groups that track hate crimes. The alleged Pittsburgh killer was a white supremacist who blamed Jews for supporting an “invasion” of migrants into the United States.“This move defies logic,” said Jonathan A. Greenblatt, ADL’s CEO and national director , about the closing of the Homeland Security branch focused on domestic terrorism. “The current administration has been chipping away at our nation’s ability to address a deadly serious national security threat: right-wing extremism. To simply disregard this threat, especially after what we witnessed in Pittsburgh, Charlottesville, Charleston, and even overseas in Christchurch, New Zealand, could put lives at risk.”

According to WWE, Kingston and Bryan will have a contract signing to make their WWE Championship match official. The last time these two were ready to sign on the dotted line, Mr. McMahon interrupted and replaced Kofi with a returning Kevin Owens. Will the WWE Universe be subject to another swerve from the McMahons?
Speaking of Kevin Owens, he will host another segment of The Kevin Owens Show tonight with guests AJ Styles and Randy Orton. The two veterans are headed toward an epic battle on Sunday, but can the two superstars wait until WrestleMania to go toe-to-toe?
There’s currently just one match confirmed for tonight and that is another round in the Rey Mysterio and Andrade feud. Both men have taken each other to the limit, but after losing to Baron Corbin on Monday Night RAW , is Rey able to take down his rival? Mysterio also has his U.S. Championship match with Samoa Joe to think about.
It’s the go-home show of SmackDown Live so expect some interesting developments to come from the two-hour event. Here’s everything that happened on the April 2 episode of SmackDown Live.

AJ Styles says that Orton has wrestled for almost 20 years and has learned one move. Orton retorts that when you have a move as deadly as the RKO that's all you need. Randy says that these independent guys think they have it so hard, but they don't know what it's like to wrestle at WrestleMania in front of tens of thousands of fans for years. Styles says yea, while he was wrestling at bingo halls and high school gymnasiums Orton was failing drug tests. Orton says that if AJ was as good as he thinks he is, he would have been in the WWE years ago Kevin Owens walks up and leaves as AJ and Randy go at it. AJ is about to hit the Phenomenal Forearm, but Orton hits the RKO.

Miz vs Sanity - 3 on 1 Handicap Match
Before the match, Miz says that he's ""taken stock"" in the past months and has realized that this is the best version of The Miz.

Joe wins via submission after a Coquina Clutch WWE Championship Contract Signing
Daniel Bryan says that Kofi stayed complacent on the sidelines and that he's getting his match at WrestleMania because of the people and Big E and Xavier Woods. Bryan says that the WWE Universe who changed ""yes"" for him are now chanting ""kofi"" for Kingston, and that they are only doing that for themselves and will discard him when they are done. But he wants Kofi to soak it in because it won't get better than this. Kofi says that he's sat down for months and listened to Bryan, but Daniel doesn't know him. Kofi says that he's sat on the sidelines while Daniel became World Heavyweight Champion in his first two years at WWE. He watched and learned and understood, and Daniel Bryan knows that his 11 years is leading up to this match and Bryan knows that he's ready and that's why he's afraid. "

Kellyanne Conway Cheers Republicans Trying to Force ‘Infanticide’ Vote: 'This is an Easy One',www.newsweek.com,,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsweek.com/kellyanne-conway-infanticide-vote-steve-scalise-twitter-1384115,"On 4/2/19 at 5:58 PM EDT Share U.S.
Counselor to the President Kellyanne Conway on Tuesday afternoon seemed to cheer on Republicans who tried to force a vote on the Born Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, which they believe would fight “infanticide.”
Conway quote tweeted House Minority Whip Steve Scalise’s tweet on his plans to introduce a petition to bypass Democratic leadership and force a vote on the act that would clarify that doctors are required to give medical care to infants who survive abortions, or be faced with criminal charges.
“House Republicans just formed a long line on the House Floor to sign my discharge petition that will force a vote on the Born Alive Act & make all members tell the American people where they stand on infanticide,” Scalise tweeted. “Now let’s see if Democrats will join us. #LetUsVote”
“Smart. This is an easy one,” Conway commented. “Infanticide: yes or no?”
Conway is among conservatives who have framed the issue as the killing of infants. In February, Conway said, “We are not a country that is going to allow illegal infanticides as long as Donald Trump is the president of the United States.” Conway at the time also accused the mainstream media of ignoring the infanticide issue and called the press “pretty much pro-abortion themselves.”

Scalise in a press conference on Tuesday said, “You can’t say you’re pro-life unless you sign the discharge petition to bring this bill up for debate and for a vote on the House floor.”
The Louisiana Representative also tweeted, “You deserve to know: Where does your representative stand on stopping infanticide? I’m filing a discharge petition TODAY to bypass Pelosi & force every member to go on record & tell the American people EXACTLY where they stand on this barbaric practice.” He hashtagged the post #LetUsVote and #EndInfanticide.
Democrats contend that infanticide is already illegal and the bill therefore is not needed. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Democratic leaders have refused to bring such legislation to the floor despite more than 25 requests from Republicans. Republicans have been fighting third-trimester abortions, in light of low public support for later abortions.
In order to force a vote on the House floor, Scalise needs 218 signatures, which is a simple majority. He hoped to gather at least 100 signatures on Tuesday.
“The whole country is going to be watching,” Scalise said, “And ultimately, they’ll be watching that list of signatures.”"

Jessica Simpson Praised for Breast Milk Pumping 'Success',www.newsweek.com,,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsweek.com/jessica-simpson-twitter-breast-milk-pumping-1384108,"On 4/2/19 at 5:47 PM EDT Share Culture Celebrity
While parenthood is no easy feat, Jessica Simpson is celebrating the maternal ""success"" she had on Tuesday, two weeks after giving birth to her newborn daughter.
Simpson, 38, and her husband Eric Johnson, 39, welcomed daughter Birdie Mae Johnson on March 19. On Tuesday, the fashion designer tweeted a picture of a baby bottle filled with milk for Birdie that was likely pumped breast milk.
""This is what success feels like,"" Simpson shared via Twitter on Tuesday. The photo's caption was accompanied by a cow emoji.
The World Health Organization (WHO) advises mothers breastfeed newborns during the child's first six months. The process boasts many benefits for mothers and babies. According to Healthline , it can put mothers at a lower risk for depression and can help promote a healthy weight for the child. Despite the reported benefits, not all women feed their babies this way. This is what success feels like _ pic.twitter.com/hsYZjxgTju — Jessica Simpson (@JessicaSimpson) April 2, 2019
Many women struggle with breastfeeding and look to alternatives for feeding their child, whether it's by way of pumping milk or using formula. Verywell Family reported that a small percentage of women can't breastfeed because of lactation failure or having a low supply of breast milk.
When Simpson shared her moment of ""success"" with bottle-feeding her newborn, she received a wave of praise from fans. Some fans replied to Simpson's tweet with simple compliments like ""well done"" and ""you go girl."" Other female fans shared their personal struggles with breastfeeding. One tweeted ""know the feeling"" while sharing a similar picture to Simpson's, another claimed it ""took all day"" for her to pump ""nearly"" the same amount the singer did, and a third woman said they could ""never pump that much.""
""I once breastfed my son to the point of my dehydration then he threw ALL of it up all over the bed,"" another fan tweeted. ""My husband gently suggested a bottle. I cried. It ain’t easy. #breastfeedingproblems.""
Birdie is Simpson's third child after daughter Maxwell Drew, 6, and son Ace Knute, 5. Shortly after giving birth to Birdie, she took to Instagram to share how they were ""so happy and proud to announce the birth of our perfect daughter."" Birdie weighed ""10 Pounds 13 Ounces.""
Simpson isn't the first star to seek an alternative option to breastfeeding. In November 2018, country singer Jana Kramer spoke out about being mom-shamed over choosing formula over breastfeeding.
""It's just frustrating when women [are told] breast milk is the best and [has] all the nutrients,"" Kramer said on her Whine Down With Jana Kramer podcast. ""I understand that—[they] don't need to tell me something that I [already] know.""

'Making a Murderer': Kathleen Zellner Responds to State of Wisconsin's Claim Steven Avery Should Not Have a New Trial,www.newsweek.com,,04-02-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsweek.com/making-murderer-kathleen-zellner-steven-avery-new-trial-wisconsin-1383858,"On 4/2/19 at 2:59 PM EDT Share Culture Movies & TV
The State of Wisconsin doesn’t want to see Making a Murderer subject Steven Avery have a new trial, it revealed in a response to Avery filed Friday. His lawyer, Kathleen Zellner, commented on the 19-page response, which aimed to negate her arguments and the new evidence in support of Avery’s alleged innocence her team presented in a brief filed March 12.
“The State is thumbing its nose at the appellate court once again,” Zellner told Newsweek on Tuesday. “That court specifically ordered that the merits of the alleged bone destruction be addressed. Rather than follow the court's directive, the State has constructed a convoluted procedural argument that defies logic or precedent.”
The Wisconsin Court of Appeals granted Avery the right to appeal in late February. One of the biggest talking points in Zellner’s follow-up brief focused on a set of potential human bones found off of Avery’s property. The bones have never been tested for DNA, and were given to Teresa Halbach’s family before testing could occur. Avery is currently in prison for killing Halbach, but Zellner argued if the bones are truly hers, they could be used to free Avery, as their placement does not adhere to the state’s original theory of where Avery killed Halbach.
Zellner argued the state committed a Youngblood v. Arizona violation when they returned the bones, meaning they could have been used as crucial evidence to Avery’s freedom, but were not preserved. The state’s response, however, claimed no Youngblood v. Arizona violation occurred, and there’s no reason to think the bones could free Avery.
The Making a Murderer lawyer stands firm on her argument that the state of Wisconsin violated Avery’s rights by returning the bones.
“Of course the State cannot address the merits of Avery's claim, because it is blatantly guilty of evidence destruction,” Zellner told Newsweek . “Its charade continues without the slightest inclination to discover the truth. Significantly, one of the culprits in the whole sad scenario authored the State's Response. Unfortunately, the citizens of Wisconsin are the recipients of this mockery of justice.""
Zellner’s last point refers to Thomas Fallon, who both prosecuted Avery in his initial trial and oversaw the decision to return the alleged human bones to the Halbach family. Fallon wrote the state’s response, according to Zellner."

How YouTuber MrBeast Pulled off a Real-Life Battle Royale in Three Weeks,www.newsweek.com,,04-02-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsweek.com/mrbeast-youtube-interview-how-did-youtuber-make-money-battle-royale-airsoft-1383921,"On March 6, three dozen of the most successful YouTube celebrities, representing a combined 200 million subscribers, gathered in a muddy field in Los Angeles to do battle. Not with traffic, but with airsoft rifles. Players like Pokimane, Odd1sout and FaZe Adapt each had three balloons attached to them, and had to pop everyone else’s balloons to be the last content creator standing. The winner would go home with $100,000. There’s only one person who could convince that much influencer firepower to slosh around in the mud for prize money: Mr. Beast.
“I wanted to make an event that would engage the whole creator community,” MrBeast, a.k.a. Jimmy Donaldson, told Newsweek . “As a YouTuber, I’ve been able to meet a lot of the creators online, but we don’t have many opportunities to meet in person and share our personalities.”
Who is MrBeast? On Getting Clicks/Views, Making Money and Finding His Calling MrBeast ranks among the most successful and creative entrepreneurs on YouTube, but his success has been hard-won. Starting off his “MrBeast6000” channel at age 13, Donaldson slogged through the algorithm until he found the content that worked for him.
“What do people want to see?” Donaldson told YouTuber Casey Neistat in a video interview. “If it gets the most views, it’s because people click on it and I want to give them what they want.”
For years, the MrBeast channel failed to catch on. Donaldson tried everything popular with the algorithm: from Minecraft and Call of Duty Let’s Plays to videos estimating the wealth of otherYouTubers. These videos would barely pull in a thousand views each, but that didn’t stop him from creating. He felt that eventually his content would rise to the top since he was willing to put in more effort than his competitors..
He struck viral gold in January 2017 when he posted a video of himself counting to 100,000, which earned tens of thousands of views in just a few days. Then he counted to 200,000. He also spun a Fidget Spinner for 24 hours, and nearly lost his mind watching Jake Paul’s “It’s Everyday Bro” music video for 10 hours straight. Dropping out of college, he committed to YouTube full time.
MrBeast showing off his merch Night Media Over the past year, Donaldson has cemented himself as YouTube royalty by spending or donating large amounts of money on his videos, including everything from giving $10,000 to an unknown live streamer with zero viewers, to trying to lift himself off the ground using only leaf blowers. To fund these ventures, Donaldson doesn’t rely on ad money and merchandise sales alone. The YouTuber has worked tirelessly to secure six-figure brand deals with major companies. His management company, Night Media, brings Donaldson offers from companies like Honey, Quidd and Seatgeek that are willing to spend tens of thousands of dollars to get a 30-second advertisement in the middle of a video. These companies want access to the following Donaldson has and is willing to pay for it.
As his empire grew, Donaldson hired a group of childhood friends to help him implement his outlandish ideas in their hometown of Greenville, North Carolina. They pulled off feats like spending a whole night in a mental ward, putting 100 million Orbeez in a pool and spending the whole day in slime. Chris, Chandler and a host of other faces are regulars in MrBeast videos, which resulted in followings of their own.
To Battle! How MrBeast Pulled Off His Real-Life Battle Royale Donaldson’s idea for a real-life battle royale first surfaced during a brainstorming session with his crew. With games like Fortnite and PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds dominating the multiplayer game space, what better idea than to bring the format into the real world? Like most MrBeast video ideas, it seemed impossible, but his team made it happen in record time.
Just two short weeks after conception, Night Media secured a sponsorship deal with Respawn’s battle royale video game Apex Legends , which put up the $200,000 in prize money. Hollywood Sports Park, a paintball and airsoft park in Los Angeles, agreed to host the event. YouTubers began to petition Donaldson for a spot on one of the teams, reaching out to him on Twitter and social media. It only took three weeks to make the battle royale idea a reality.
“There was a lot of teamwork involved in planning the event,” Donaldson said. “All the people on my team worked hard and diligently to ensure all aspects of the production were thought-out and rehearsed.”
Every contestant had a GoPro camera on their chest and cameras circulated the perimeter, giving the whole event a reality television vibe. Alliances were created and shattered, while BBs zipped through the air. A group of editors went through dozens of hours of footage, piecing together a 26-minute video which has pulled in more than 15 million views.
“Everyone was having a blast doing something unique and fun,” Donaldson said. “There were lots of smiles and personal relationships that we’ll all take forward in supporting what we do—creating original content for our subscribers.”
Even through the mud, sweat and tears, Donaldson claims there wasn’t any “drama” on the field. Players were genuinely happy to be a part of this experience and “left their subscriber count at the gate.” wEven though these are some of the biggest Youtubers in the world, Donaldson said, “there were no egos on display.”
For YouTube hopefuls who dream of meeting their favorite content creators in mindless combat, Donaldson says the future is bright. As “technology” grows, it will be “easier to interact and play games with your favorite content creators. For us, it will be even closer interaction with our subscribers.”

Towards a critical defense of “identity politics”,socialistworker.org,Pranav Jani,04-03-2019,2019,4,http://socialistworker.org/2019/04/03/towards-a-critical-defense-of-identity-politics,"Towards a critical defense of “identity politics” April 3, 2019 Print
This is an expanded and updated version of a document written by Pranav Jani during the period leading up to the ISO’s 2019 national convention in February. Along with a general call for more democracy and openness in the ISO amid the labor upsurge and growing socialist movement, people of color (POC) at the Convention demanded a recognition of their experiences of racism and discrimination in the ISO, and identified theories and practices that prevented the development and leadership of POC members.
Delegates at the convention elected POC comrades to national leadership in unprecedented numbers, including over 50 percent representation of POC/Native members on the Steering Committee. While the ISO voted to dissolve itself following news of a badly mishandled rape allegation in 2013 that decimated the group, many comrades will continue to work together in identifying what went wrong, and contribute to building a socialist movement that is truly grounded in fighting all instances of oppression.
THIS ESSAY calls for a critical defense of “identity politics” in order to better respect the experience and knowledge that people of color and those from other oppressed communities bring to s in the U.S. — and to prevent their marginalization from these groups.
My argument, which applies broadly but centers race, has two aspects: 1) rejecting the ISO’s understanding of identity politics as oppositional to Marxism, a position I reluctantly enforced for many years; and 2) suggesting that the Bolsheviks’ critical support for anti-colonial nationalism in the 1920s provides an excellent template for defending identity politics in a critical way.
But first, in light of current discussions about assessing the ISO as we begin the process of dissolving the organization, let me explain a bit about my own experiences in the ISO, and how this argument fits in a bigger picture. Building an anti-racist
I joined the ISO as a graduate student in 1995, when I was 23 years old. Brought up at the heart of a South Asian immigrant community in New Jersey with two unionized educators, I held a mix of ideas, from anti-racist, anti-imperialist, and pro-labor positions on the one hand, to fairly conservative positions on gender and sexuality on the other.
While I was starting to learn about Marxism in my classes, it was nothing like the education I got in the ISO. Besides learning about an entirely new way of looking at the world through study groups, meetings and discussions, I went to my first picket lines, organized my first rallies and actions and coalitions and started working with activists from a variety of backgrounds and communities — challenging and transforming my political ideas.
Make no mistake: despite disagreements on how we talked about race I stayed in the ISO for nearly 24 years because of our consistent anti-racism and anti-imperialism, which we placed at the center of the fight for socialism.
The ISO’s politics and organization gave me space to lead on these fronts again and again: fighting against our campus police having guns in 1995; launching a branch of the Campaign to End the Death Penalty in 1996; organizing against Bill Clinton’s crime bill, welfare cuts and “humanitarian” wars; challenging NYC police brutality in the late 1990s; building the global justice movement after Seattle 1999; rejecting post 9/11 Islamophobia and militarism; protesting the Iraq War of 2003; organizing for immigrants rights in 2006; mobilizing for Trayvon Martin in 2012; supporting the Black Lives Matter Movement in 2014 and after; building campaigns for BDS and Palestinian rights; fighting fascism and white supremacy after Trump; and on and on.
On the theoretical front, the ISO always aimed to reject the sort of class reductionism that is interested in race, gender, sexuality and the like only as a function of economics. With whatever limitations we had — and this essay is about a major limitation — we never argued that the fight against oppression was a secondary issue that would miraculously solve itself once we did away with capitalism.
And we would be innovative as well. In recent years, for example, I have had ample room to develop our understanding of colonialism, racism, and anti-colonialism through talks on Indian revolutionaries like M.N. Roy, the 1857 Rebellion in British India, African liberation movements, and Marxist theories of colonialism.
And yet, despite all of these incredible experiences and ideas, and despite our layer of experienced POC leaders across the nation — absolutely visible at the convention — the ISO had a dubious track record in encouraging the leadership of POC, in retaining POC cadre, and encouraging POC spaces for communication and development.
On the individual level, as comrade after comrade publicly testified at the Convention, we experienced disrespect and belittling, severe pushback when raising arguments for caucuses or for new ways of approaching identity and privilege and aggressions and microaggressions that, frankly, are our daily experiences in white-majority spaces.
Time after time, we were kept from leadership positions. In an organization with a historically low number of POC leaders at the national level, I only joined a national leadership in 2017, after over two decades of work. Many other POC comrades can share stories of being passed over despite ample evidence of their political ability to lead.
As many have noted, POC comrades ourselves often enforced these arguments to other POC. This shows that the issue was systemic and not only individual. Mainstream society trains everyone to diminish people of color — so it is quite easy for people of color in positions of authority to do the same.
Or, we learned to hold our tongues. In the middle of so much good activist work against racism and imperialism, and with the absence of alternatives on the left, we often raised debates but then let them go after facing a wall of resistance. This was precisely my experience when challenging the ISO’s positions on “white skin privilege” and “identity politics” over the years.
To be clear: I reject the idea that the group that I helped to build for decades was a racist organization. That would erase the hard work of comrades of color, especially, and doesn’t explain the whole story.
But I also reject the idea that anti-racist practices and ideas themselves could have made the ISO, or could make any white-majority socialist group, immune to the racism that rages around us. Whether through direct acts of racism from individuals, ideas that ended up targeting and invalidating POC experience or undemocratic practices that had a disproportionate impact on POC, comrades have been victimized for years. And we are the ones who stayed.
The socialist left, if it is ever to be successful, needs to transform itself to meet the needs of POC comrades, and to stamp out the ugly presence of racism wherever it raises its head. Rejecting the dismissal of “identity politics”
Socialists can start by rejecting over-simplified criticisms of what is called “identity politics.” In fact, we should probably stop using the term altogether because its meaning is unclear and imprecise — and gets in the way of connecting with people from marginalized and oppressed communities.
At worst, the criticism of identity politics seems to minimize subjective experiences of social reality — and to suggest that comrades who have not experienced racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia and the like are in the best position to advise and correct those who have.
For Marxist organizers, the knowledge and perspective that develops through someone’s direct experience of oppression/exploitation should be not only worthy of our full respect but a crucial building block to revolutionary consciousness.
We know this in practice, as evidenced by decades of Socialist Worker pieces foregrounding people’s own voices when talking about politics and struggle. Frankly, the ISO would have never been able to organize a single rally or action or strike, not to speak of recruiting comrades from marginalized backgrounds, if its members didn’t have a fundamental understanding of this central point.
Yet, we persisted with an approach that said we needed to “win people away from” or “break people from” identity politics. We cited “identity politics” as a shorthand for a negative political assessment of comrades, and lost the opportunity to actually dialogue with them beyond this label.
Such practices construct a rigid barrier between socialists and those who — precisely because of oppression — tend to foreground their identity in articulating their politics.
In fact, at its worst, “identity politics” could be used like a club to silence people — doing a great deal of harm to members and contacts of the ISO who were POC, queer, trans and/or otherwise marginalized in society.
The historic argument against Black or POC caucuses in the ISO — which I also made, for years — is a clear example of how our excessively critical approach to identity issues tended to push oppressed communities back.
The implicit assumption here is that POC getting together would somehow weaken our project of building a multiracial Such lack of trust is extremely harmful, and reproduces the marginalization that POC feel in society everyday.
In 1938, speaking to the Socialist Workers Party (US), C.L.R. James went much further than caucuses, arguing that:
The awakening political consciousness of the Negro... takes the form of independent action uncontrolled by whites. The Negroes have long felt, and more than ever feel today, the urge to create their own organizations under their own leaders and thus assert...their claim to complete equality with other American citizens. Such a desire is legitimate and most be vigorously supported even when it takes the form of a rather aggressive chauvinism.
Why is it that we always defended the right of the oppressed to resist in any way they choose, but restricted our own members from doing so?
How can we, as the broader socialist left, embrace the knowledge and perspectives coming from the experience of oppression and recognize it for what it is — a strong, potential basis for revolutionary and socialist organizing? Expanding Marxist theory
What I’m saying here is in line with much bigger shifts and developments inside the ISO starting at least a decade ago — and the tremendous work by our comrades in conceptually applying and developing Marxist methods to understanding social oppression and resistance.
By 2019, ISO members were asked to understand the relationships between capitalism and sexuality, disability, gender, race and settler colonialism — a far cry from years past. Intersectionality, social reproduction theory, the contributions of Black feminism, trans liberation, Native liberation — these were now part of the language we used and the radical traditions we cited.
For many of us, these changes took far too long. It seems outright laughable that “feminism” was not a term we used regularly before, seeing it as a stand-in for middle-class, bourgeois ideology.
But the shift was real, and reflected our taking seriously the idea that Marxism is a living, breathing tradition, that other radical traditions have concepts and observations that can be compatible with Marxism and that we need to explore what we can learn from them.
My call for a critical defense of identity politics aims to continue this opening up of Marxism and socialist organizing. Socialists need to better understand the identities and experiences of the oppressed, and learn how to link them more firmly to the development of revolutionary consciousness. Talking identity
As Marxists, we stand (and ought to stand) for the unity of the working class across lines of social identity (race, gender, sexuality, nationality, caste, religion, etc.). We maintain that:
the working class is composed of people of all identities; ruling-class ideology and the workings of capitalism fragment the working class and turn it against itself; and the historical development of capitalism is integrated with and reproduces structures and institutions that perpetuate social oppression (settler colonialism, slavery, colonialism, the family and patriarchy, gender binaries, etc.)
Identities, then, are constructs, and products of historical divisions and conflicts.
But saying identities are constructs doesn’t mean they are therefore “fake” — any more than saying race is a historical construct wipes away the realities of racism. Identity plays a big role on the level of consciousness, self-perception and self-pride for oppressed groups — and often opens up a path to understanding oppression as part of a system.
Identity has at least two aspects: a name or category that a person chooses for themselves, and a box that a person is shoved into when they enter the world. In fact, the two are inseparable.
Even if a person feels their self-definition is utterly unique, and that they or their community are distinct from everyone else, that desire itself should be seen by Marxists as a product of history, not just as the projection of an individual.
And in fact this history is one of oppression and alienation — commonly known as “othering”. Those from oppressed and marginalized and/or minority groups often are the ones who rush towards identifying themselves as distinct; those of majority groups, comforted in being seen as “normal” or even “universal”, don’t often feel such a need — except in response.
This is why “Black power” and “women’s rights” in the U.S. can articulate a radical position and the expansion of liberation, but “white power” and “men’s rights” points to a world of greater oppression.
Criticism of “identity politics” from the left is something to think very hard about and question. Not just today, when the right is falling all over itself to go after identity politics, but even in earlier decades.
Some have argued that identity politics in the 1980s and 1990s was a product of postmodern anti-Marxism and therefore had to be fought sharply by those seeking to preserve a socialist current.
There is some truth to this, but we need to ask more questions and dig deeper. Why is it that, when we read the postmodernists, they too are quite critical of identity politics, seeing it as opposed to “difference”? How did “identity politics” as used by the Combahee River Collective in their manifesto of the late 1970s differ from and/or contend with the postmodernist critiques of the term?
One might have criticism of how a particular worldview linked to an assertion of identity answers important questions like why oppression happens, what liberation looks like and who are allies and enemies. But it’s best to criticize that worldview, not the origins and experiences that produced it.
In fact, we would be better served going in the opposite direction, asserting the value and importance of identity and experience first, before becoming suspicious of “identity politics.” Valuing experience
Valuing experience is not new for the socialist and Marxist left. In fact it’s crucial to our ideas about history and change. We know that reporting the experience of the oppressed and the exploited is central to contesting ruling class ideology and media, which projects ruling class experience and interests as universal truth.
When someone walks into a meeting or up to a mic and shares their experience — of being a person of color, of being a worker, of being disabled — we value that immensely, even if we don’t agree with all of their political framework or ideas.
And when we assert that grassroots movements are what makes change, or that revolutions are festivals of the oppressed or that the “emancipation of the working class is the act of the working class itself,” we are showing how much we value people’s ability to think and act against capitalism and oppression because of their own experiences, and the understanding that flows from that.
Marxists critical of identity politics are actually opposing — and should continue to raise questions about — a set of ideas and practices that refuses to see capitalism as linked to social oppression, or sees anyone who does not experience a given oppression as automatically complicit in that oppression or encourages reactionary politics on the name of fighting oppression.
Nothing I am saying is about dropping these positions. Rather, I’m saying they should not be counterposed to “identity politics” (which appears to critique the origins of the politics) but to the political positions themselves, with a method and approach that begins by respecting the oppressed and marginalized person’s experience and knowledge. Parallels with national liberation
Marxism, especially in its Leninist formulations, already offers a great template for valuing an oppressed group’s self-definition and identification while also maintaining a critical approach.
I’m referring to the tradition’s historic approach to anti-colonial nationalism — particularly in 1921 and 1922, after the Comintern brought together Bolsheviks and anti-colonial and anti-racist revolutionaries from around the globe — including MN Roy, Claude McKay and many others — who themselves participated in shaping the policy.
A very brief outline of the position is as follows:
1) Marxists value the self-determination of oppressed nations, and regard this is crucial to the fight against imperialism, against capitalism and for true and democratic internationalism.
2) Anti-colonial movements are made up of diverse elements but tend to be objectively against capital — and need to be defended by Marxists.
3) But this defense is critical, not absolute. The cross-class alliance inherent in any anti-colonial struggle is repressing a clash of class interests. Marxists side with the workers and peasants within anti-colonial movements, as well as oppressed groups within the movement, because only a fight against capitalism and oppression — not just the securing of an independent nation-state — can bring genuine liberation.
4) Some anti-colonial and anti-imperial struggles are reactionary, and supporting them would go against the current that potentially flows from national liberation to socialism. Working classes and oppressed groups within oppressed nations are targeted by and need to fight such elements, and our affiliation is with the oppressed.
The term “identity politics” is so broad that it cannot be simply blended with anti-colonial nationalism. While the latter’s fight to win political freedom is in part motivated by identity and culture, it is also sharply defined by the centrality of land recovery and democratic self-rule.
But the method and principles by which Marxists have developed the critical defense of anti-colonial nationalism shows us what a critical defense of identity politics would look like. Moving with, not against, identity and experience
Beyond listening to people, not writing them off, and other good practices that we should always strive for, we need to get away from a mindset that says “we need to get people to be critical of identity politics, but for now we want to connect with them.”
Instead we should be for moving, with the stream, from people’s identities and experiences toward Marxist understandings of oppression and exploitation — with an appreciation of identity and experience as crucial places where people from marginalized groups first cut their teeth in questioning a world that others them and oppresses them.
Besides becoming more and more open to the radicalization today, this understanding will alleviate a huge burden that many of us, including myself, have always felt in squaring our theory with our practice within socialist spaces.
Rather than feeling we are going into battle when speaking with contacts and new members who radicalized out of their experience of marginalization, rather than feeling we have to name their questions as “identity politics” (either to them or in reporting to contact organizers), rather than seeing Marxism as an “inoculation” against the “pull” of identity, socialists can see our task as engaging with what people already know and feel, listening and learning from this exchange, and putting forward ideas and perspectives that we have in a comradely dialogue.
I’m not arguing that revolutionary socialists shouldn’t voice disagreements and arguments with people. If we don’t share a vision of working class organizing across identities and experiences, then we might be in disagreement about some fundamental questions regarding oppression, resistance and change. This needs to be acknowledged and discussed.
My argument is simply that we need to recognize that people from marginalized communities who engage with socialist groups are already radicalizing, way before they meet us.
In terms of POC comrades, the socialist left must realize that those who come to our meetings and events are already expressing an interest in multiracial organizing. They/we are already facing censure from “our own” communities for working closely with or within a (white) socialist formation.
The left, in this period of working class fightback and rising white supremacy, must — at minimum — do everything we can to reduce the barriers between such POC comrades and
Only then can we even start to think about the layers and layers of POC and specifically Black leadership that would be necessary to imagine a workers’ revolution in the U.S."

BUCKINGHAM PALACE (TheSkunk.org) – Queen Elizabeth II today revealed she felt “violated” thousands of times over the past 70 years as dignitaries from around the world grabbed and kissed her hand. Elizabeth, who ascended to the throne in 1952, described the hand-kissing incidents as an invasion of her personal space, explaining that it made her feel “vulnerable and unsafe.”
The queen referred to the kissing of her hand without explicit permission to be “wanton sexual misconduct toward the crown.”
“Good heavens!” she declared. “Prince Phillip won’t even perform that act.”
She admitted the “Me-Too” movement motivated her to finally go public. “It’s such a relief to free myself from this dark secret,” she noted. “I mean, who could I tell? Who would believe me, a woman, against the word of the very wealthy and powerful?”
“All the men and women who have stepped forward to reveal their experiences with unwanted advances,” she added, “gave me the courage to finally emerge from the shadows and convey my own story.”"

At 16, Casey Diaz went to prison for killing a man. The son of an alcoholic father, Diaz grew up in a rough neighborhood and first saw three men killed when he was 8. By the time he was 11, he joined a gang. But after years in prison, Diaz, the author of new book “ The Shot Caller, ” had a religious conversion—and inspired others to change their lives as well, including a founder of MS-13. Read the transcript, posted below, or listen to the podcast.
We also cover these stories: President Donald Trump is now saying health care will have to wait until after the next election. House Republicans want to protect babies born alive after abortion–and on Tuesday, they launched a discharge petition effort. Democrat senators introduced new legislation to expand government-controlled health care options.

Kate Trinko: We’re joined today by Casey Diaz, the author of the new book “The Shot Caller: A Latino Gangbanger’s Miraculous Escape from a Life of Violence to a New Life in Christ.” Casey, let’s start from the beginning. Can you tell us about growing up and how you ended up joining a gang when you were 11?
Casey Diaz: I was brought here by my parents when I was 2 years old. Our family comes from El Salvador. They came here legally. But unfortunately, we landed in an area which is called the Rampart District of Los Angeles. And some of you might know with reference to the Rampart scandal that made the news, so that’s the area I grew up in.
My mom was a seamstress, so she would get up early in the morning, four in the morning and go out to work. I wouldn’t get to see her until about 10, 11 o’clock at night.
My father, on the other hand, was very alcoholic, abusive physically and vocally, or verbally. Here comes my mom from pulling two shifts to getting attacked physically by my father. Violence started very early in my house, in our apartment. Then, at the age of 8, I witnessed a triple murder right before my eyes.
In L.A., in these older buildings, they have fire escapes, kind of like the ones in New York. I would go outside, we lived on the third floor, and I’d kind of sit there and dangle my feet from the fire escape. That was kind of like my routine as a kid.
On this particular day, it was broad daylight, and the car pulled to the side, three males were walking up an alley and the guy driving simply gets out of his car, doesn’t run, doesn’t scream or anything. Just walks up to these three guys and puts bullets in each and every single one of them.
Then, once he’s done with the bullets, he reloads. He takes out the shells, and then reloads and finishes his execution of three guys in that alley. I was there watching the whole thing. You got violence in the apartment, then you got violence outside.
Trinko: … I can’t even imagine being 8 and seeing this. Did you go inside? Did you cry?
Diaz: I didn’t.
Trinko: How did you react?
Diaz: That was the surprising thing. … I remember seeing one of them yell. He was actually yelling for his mother, and he was holding his abdomen and he was under a carport. He kind of struggled his way to try to get away, but he fell a few steps under a carport.
There they are, and you kind of get desensitized in a way because you’re just seeing brutality and as a kid, you kind of look at that incident and what’s going on in the home, and you go, “Well, I guess this is how you handle matters when someone steps over you.”
At 11, I got introduced into this local gang. I found a gang leader that took me under his wing, very popular guy. He was very violent himself. I got introduced to the gang, jumped into the gang, and then normally what happens is you’ll end up having an assignment. That would mean it could be anything from a robbery, to a murder, to anything.
Because I was with him, he took me to an area where rival gang members were at, specifically to 18th Street, where we captured one of them. We beat him, and he did most of the work. He stabbed him. He stabbed him and then when he was finished stabbing him, he kind of just gave me the screwdriver and said, “Now, it’s your turn.” And so my first stabbing was at 11 years old as well.
Daniel Davis: Wow, so five years you were in a gang, from 11 to 16. What was it like during those later years, what kind of stuff were you involved in?
Diaz: Many robberies, break-ins of homes, but more than anything else it was just the violence was what drove me. I explained my story. In many ways, there’s different rankings within every gang, especially the ones that are organized.
You have the guys that are just kind of drinking beer at a liquor store. They’re harmful but they’re not doing really anything. They like to play the part more than anything else. They like the parties. Then, you have the gang leaders or the potential gang leaders that are out there and what we call putting in work, and that meant going out there and looking for rivals. For me, it was very easy, it became very easy at that age to … My preference was the violence. I went out there and always looked for rival gang members.
Davis: So mostly against other gangs?
Diaz: Yeah, mostly against other gangs throughout Los Angeles. It just became a pattern to the point where I really couldn’t sleep unless I went out there and did something. I didn’t like the drive-by shooting thing, unfortunately, I was more of a hands-on guy, and so stabbing was what I preferred to do with these guys.
Trinko: What besides the violence do you think attracted you to life within the gang? What did you enjoy?
Diaz: It gave me a false sense of family, of belonging, of being respected, of being validated by them, and not having a father figure or a mentor at that young age. The streets has a habit of embracing you very quickly in those times of where you need to be told what’s a good direction to take. Unfortunately, I ended up in this kind of lifestyle.
Davis: You were 16 when you were arrested. Tell us how that happened.
Diaz: In this particular day, back in the ’80s, you were able to drive trucks, and you were able to hang out in the back of the truck. No seatbelts were required or anything like that. It was not against the law.
T rinko: Wild time.
Diaz: Yeah. It was a wild time. I happened to be at a little burger joint when … some members of 18th Street gang came by, they recognized me, and a fight ensued inside the little burger joint. I ran to the vehicle that was outside. Unfortunately, I ended up killing … the first guy that approached me.
Davis: So were police on the scene? Did they arrest you then?
Diaz: No, I was a fugitive for 21 days after that. I ended up living in abandoned apartment buildings, construction sites. One of the moms from one of my gang members, she took me in for a few days. I was just trying to keep a low profile, I kind of disappeared for a minute. Then, I got captured by the Los Angeles Police Crash Unit, that’s their gang special unit.
Trinko: Was the guy whose life you took, was he a gang member of a rival gang or what did you have?
Diaz: He was one of the leaders of 18th Street at that time from a clique called Colombia, which that was the headquarters of 18th Street in Los Angeles.
Trinko: And that was a rival gang to yours? I’m not familiar with the gang world.
Diaz: That’s good. 18th Street was a gang that we used to get along with. We had fathers, sisters, brothers that were in the same gang. I never liked them, so I was the one that called the shot to go against them. I didn’t like them. I didn’t like how they did the business out there.
I’m young, but violence was just my thing. I was the one that made the decision to go against them and to take over their territory, and which we ended up doing eventually. It made big news because of a lot of us from my gang, unfortunately again, it was a lot of spilling of blood throughout the streets of L.A.
Davis: What was your trial like and how did you feel when you heard your sentence?
Diaz: I didn’t really care. That’s what’s expected of you. I don’t know of a gang member that journals, and says, “Maybe I shouldn’t be doing this.” No, we all had the mentality and everybody was trying to up do the other person.
Every gang leader in this gang was just trying—if you’re going to do three murders, we’re going to do four type of gunning. The blood shed in Los Angeles in the ’80s, I mean, you see the reports from back then, and it was vicious. It was a lot of violence.
Trinko: What was prison like for you? I believe you said you were in solitary confinement?
Diaz: Yeah. … CDC has this point system from one to 100 and so the higher you score, the more security level that is needed for you. At that time, I don’t know how they do it now, but at that time, the higher you scored, more security.
I ended up going over there with 97 points, which meant going to the SHU program from the bus to the SHU, no questions asked. And just sort of an undetermined sentence, meaning I have to finish my whole sentence in solitary. I was prepared for that. I didn’t care.
My first meal served in Folsom was served by the Hillside Strangler, so these are the guys that we heard in the news and I lived with, the Menendez brothers …
Trinko: Oh yeah, the ones who killed their parents, right? Or allegedly.
Diaz: He was there in the A yard. You’re surrounded by nothing but like-minded people. You really don’t care about your actions, you really don’t. It was on my third year of solitary confinement where … this little Baptist church came, and a little lady, a little black lady by the name of Francis Proctor, she was very, very bold and requested to approach my cell.
You got to understand that in the SHU, you got Pelican Bay, you have the Corcoran SHU, which made the news big time, and you have Folsom. Those are the three major prisons to go in California. … If there’s any influence in you, this would be like your Harvard, Yale, and Penn State in the street world.
Here we are, and here’s this lady coming into one of the most darkest places in the prison, and she is so bold with this correctional officer.
By the way, the CO is telling her, “You really don’t want nothing to do with him.” I didn’t know that they were talking about me until the very last approach with her, “Jesus came for everybody. Can I have permission to approach his cell?” And she was granted the permission to do that, and the guard said, “That’s Diaz in there. You’re wasting your time.” That’s when I knew that it was me.
She approached and she asked me a very vibrant question. She said, “How are you doing?” And she had a very Southern accent. “How you doing?” She was just being her, and I said, “Couldn’t be any better.” And she says, “Pretty stupid question.” I said, “That’s right.”
She invited me to this Bible study thing to listen to this Bible study and I told her, I was very respectful, and I just said, “I’m not interested. Thank you, but no thank you.” She said something after that that caught my attention. She said, “I’m going to put you on my hit list.” That’s a word that you might not want to use in solitary confinement. She says, “I’m going to pray for you. You’re going to be on my prayer hit list and Jesus is going to use you.”
I thought at first glance, at that answer, at that statement, I thought, “This lady’s crazy. She doesn’t know what she’s talking about. She doesn’t know where she’s at.” Then, she asked for my permission—they came once a month—if she could approach my cell and just say hi to me and pray for me. I said, “You can do whatever you want. I’m just letting you know that I’m not joining your Bible study.”
So this continued for over a year and a few months where she was just consistent to stop at my cell. She would always end the conversation with, “I’m praying for you, and Jesus is going to use you.”
I had an experience in that cell that challenged me in my life to change, and it was very real, very raw. And I had a moment, an encounter with Christ in there, in which I had to make a decision whether I would continue in this organized crime life, life of crime, or I was going to make that change.
I knew that what I had experienced in that cell, in that 8-by-10 cell was authentic. It was real. It brought me to my knees. I had never heard the gospel. I had never opened the Bible, never went to church.
The church, or Christ, or anybody, it just wasn’t in my radar and so I’m finding myself in the middle of this cell and weeping like a kid, saying to God—and this is going to sound a little odd but, I think that when you come to the lord, you need to just be you. For me, it was that and I remember just being very open with him and saying, “God, I’m so sorry for stabbing this person, and I’m so sorry for stabbing that person.”
It just went on, and on, and on. I say this to folks when I’m sharing my story, I have never tasted freedom like I tasted freedom in solitary confinement that moment because it changed my life. Then, I got some instructions a few days later where I needed to make a decision to step down from my leadership there, which I did.
Trinko: Your leadership in the gang?
Diaz: Yeah. By doing that, it would cause a green light, meaning a hit would be put on your life. A hit was put on my life, and for the next two years it was a little rough.
We have this phrase that we use in California in the prison system, it’s called “the hard candy.” That just simply means we’re going to beat you close to your death every time we get a chance to. That happened to me and to others like me over the next two years. But the guy that came to do the hit, he became the first guy that I led to Christ in there, and then he joined me.
Now there’s two of us with hard candy, and then two other guys. One of the founding members of MS-13 came to Christ through my testimony. Very shortly, a very short time, you have a guy from Florence 13, which had big heavy ties to the Mexican Mafia, and you had a guy from Watts, a gang leader from there. Here we are, four or five of us and we’re willing to lay down our life for the gospel, and it didn’t matter. We knew that God had touched our hearts.
Trinko: For you and these others, you mentioned that the Baptist lady had asked you to join Bible study and you weren’t interested. Before you had your conversion experience, did you open a Bible? Did you have any familiarity or … you just sort of unprompted went to God? And how about for the other men you led to conversion?
Diaz: For me, I had never opened the Bible. It wasn’t part of my life. But for them, I knew that we have these things, we called them kites, or another word for that would be wila, W-I-L-A. It’s a short term for a note. Usually a kite or a wila was once something that you would pass to another gang member, like a trustee, or through anybody else. And most likely on that kite, it would be the name of a hit that needed to be done or stuff that needed to be done outside the prison walls or within CDC.
I knew that if I wrote something, my testimony on these notes, and if they took it from me, they would read because we have another phrase and these are all prison slang, words that we use. Taking out the trash meant killing somebody and taking them off the yard.
I knew that they couldn’t hang out with somebody that was the trash. But if they took it from me, I was 100% sure they were going to read it and that’s how I was able to reach every single one of them when I caught them by themselves, kind of slipped them the note. That’s how I ended up witnessing to the first four, and they became Christians from that point.
Trinko: What did the note say?
Diaz: It was easy. One of the notes, one of the first notes was, “Look at me, and why would I give this power away? Why would I surrender my leadership in this place unless something really happened in that cell?”
I didn’t know the Bible. These are just words, but I believe that the Holy Spirit was the one that was behind these words and it was the simplicity of the gospel, written just handwriting, and giving them to these guys that understood where I was coming from.
What other reason, what did I have to gain from stepping down from a high position like that inside the SHU program? When they took it, I knew that it would affect their life and these guys became born again through my testimony there.
Davis: Wow. What’s happened with you since you left prison? Tell us about that.
Diaz: Well, it’s been over two decades. I’ve been married to my wife, just celebrated 20 years with a believing wife. I got three kids all in private school. I’m a pastor now, and God has blessed my life.
Trinko: That’s such an unusual conversion story, to put it mildly. How do you think it shaped your life since, and does it change how you look back at your past?
Diaz: Yeah. One of the things is … it makes you grateful. Somebody asked me in another interview, do I feel like I deserve to be out here? My answer will always be no. I know that what I’ve done, and I know that I sinned before God. But I also know that God gives second chances. I also know that the blood of Christ covers all sin, including what I did. I wish I could rewind time. I wish I would have never done that. I wish I would have never gotten involved in gangs.
Unfortunately, that was my case. What do I do with the time, the second chance that God has given me? The only thing that I can find to do is to educate people, to be a voice in low-income families, low-income cities, and to tell them that there is still hope.
You could be in my position right now, and Christ is still there with an outstretched arm ready to save. If you call on his name, the Bible tells us that we’ll be saved, and everything that comes after that, I’m grateful.
Every morning that I wake up, I got these French doors in my bedroom, I always wake up at three in the morning and open those curtains, and it’s still dark out there but that’s when I wake up. I look outside and I can’t believe where God has me and what God has me doing in this time of my life. The story wasn’t told for two decades, and it wasn’t the right timing.
We look at what’s happening here in Washington, D.C.; Virginia; Los Angeles; New York with all the gang activity, and all that across America. I think that the story needed to wait until this time to come out.
There’s a lot of crime books, and true crime stories, but I think on our end is we wanted to make sure that we weren’t just being raw for the sake of being raw and real, but we wanted to make sure that people, when they finished this book, that they would have gone to the lord, and really do a change in their heart by accepting him.
Davis: You mentioned inner cities and gangs being a growing problem in America. What would you say to parents who are concerned that their kids might get involved in gangs?
Diaz: I think that I can only recommend what worked for me. For me, the only thing that, or the only person that worked for me was the lord. I would say, find yourself a local church, a Bible teaching church, and get your family involved. It’s never too late. There’s youth ministries that are in these churches that are vital, that’ll be helpful, that where young pastors, young youth pastors have a heart for these kids and they’ll mentor. They lead them in a right path.
Get them into sports, and absolutely, if you can, by all means, get them out of that neighborhood, by all means, and then start over. I think those are so important. I talk about that in the book as well at the end. There’s some advice for parents and single parents as well. It’s something that’s dear to my heart.
Trinko: You mentioned that the issue is newly relevant right now. Of course President Trump has talked a lot about MS-13, which you’ve mentioned. There’s other gangs. What do you think the U.S. should do?
Diaz: I think I’m in full agreement with what he’s doing, and what he intends to do with the border and border security. There’s so many people in Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Central America and all that.
I think there’s noble people that really want to come here in pursuit of their dream. There’s nothing wrong with that. But I think that there’s a system in place that they need to respect, and that’s coming through the turnstiles in the right way. Let us check you out. If all turns out well, by all means, pursue your dream here. This is the only place that gives you the opportunity to build a dream in this place, like no other place.
Let’s say these caravans that are on their way right now, I can tell you, and I can tell you from experience, that from an 8-by-10 cell, there is much activity and shots are being called to Mexico, to Guatemala, to El Salvador, and they are being prepared to come in here by all means. If that means disguising themselves in these caravans, they will do that.
I think that it’s important that we listen to what the president is doing right now, and if that wall needs to be built, or the border be shut immediately, then it needs to do that. The safety of America is at hand and we need to pay attention to that and not be naïve to the dangers of gangs and predators that want to come here and harm Americans.
Davis: Well, Casey, you have a powerful story of God’s grace, and thank you for coming in and sharing.
Diaz: Thank you guys so much for having me on your show.
Trinko: Thanks for coming on, and of course your book is called “The Shot Caller” if anyone wants to check it out. "

Last week, former Vice President Joe Biden spoke at the Biden Courage Awards ceremony in preparation for his presidential campaign launch. There, in an attempt to forestall claims that as a white man, he simply isn’t intersectional enough to compete in the Democratic primaries, he critiqued a central pillar of Western civilization as inherently racist.
“Back in the late 1300s, so many women were dying at the hands of their husbands because they were chattel, just like the cattle, or the sheep, that the court of common law decided they had to do something about the extent of the deaths,” Biden fibbed.
So you know what they said? No man has a right to chastise his woman with a rod thicker than the circumference of his thumb. This is English jurisprudential culture, a white man’s culture. It’s got to change. It’s got to change.
Biden’s take was, as always, historically illiterate. The “rule of thumb” story has been circulating for years—and it has been repeatedly debunked. There was no “rule of thumb,” as feminist scholar Christina Hoff Sommers points out.
“On the contrary,” she writes, “British law since the 1700s and our American laws predating the Revolution prohibit wife beating.” In actuality, the phrase originated in craftsmen so expert that they could perform tasks without precise measuring tools.
More importantly, however, Biden’s characterization of “English jurisprudential culture” as “white man’s culture” is profoundly disturbing.
English jurisprudential culture is rooted in the belief in the rule of law, due process of law, equal rights under law; English jurisprudential culture is responsible for preserving the natural rights we hold dear, rights which were imperfectly but increasingly extended over time to more and more human beings, particularly minorities.
No less a leftist figure than Barack Obama explained just that in 2009, saying he sought a system at Guantanamo Bay that “adheres to the rule of law, habeas corpus, basic principles of Anglo-American legal system.”
Protection of individual rights—and in particular, minority rights—lies at the heart of English jurisprudence. Yet Biden boiled down those rights to racial privilege.
And the attempt to reduce the fundamental principles of our civilization to a mask for racial hierarchical power is both false and frightening. It suggests that those principles ought to be undermined for purposes of disestablishing that supposed hierarchy. Get rid of English jurisprudential law, presumably, in order to fight racism.
Ironically, reduction of Western civilization to racial supremacy isn’t just a strategy of the intersectional left; it’s a strategy of the despicable alt-right, which champions Western civilization as white civilization and then seeks to rip away the universalism of its principles from nonwhite people.
Thus, the very term “Western civilization” is under assault by a variety of political forces seeking to tear out eternal truths and natural rights in the name of tribalism.
But that’s not what Western civilization is about at all. Western civilization was built on Judeo-Christian values and Greek reason, culminating in a perspective on natural rights that is preserved by institutions like English jurisprudence.
It is thanks to those philosophical principles that free markets, free speech, and free association have grown and flourished. Only if we re-enshrine those principles, rather than undermine them, will our prosperity and freedoms be preserved.

Would like to know the thumb rule for selecting filter frequency cut off. I want to realize 4th order filter by combining analog + digital How should I choose analog filter cut off, sampling rate and digital filter cutoff. Requirement is 100Hz 4th order Re: Thumb rule for selecting filter frequency cut off Originally Posted by garimella thumb rule for selecting filter frequency cut off. The raw formula for capacitors: f= 1 / (2 Pi R C) Besides a resistor or resistors which are in plain sight, often a neighboring component has some unknown or unseen resistance, which must be taken into account. - - - Updated - - - Inductors also are used in filters. There is a formula for cutoff frequency with inductors. However capacitors tend to be more convenient to use for high-pass or low-pass, especially at small Ampere levels. Re: Thumb rule for selecting filter frequency cut off Hi, The above formula is correct, but only for first order RC filter. You asked about 4th order. My personal opinion: There is no rule of thumb. It depends. First please give some basic informations: * LPF, BPF, HPF? * filter at the ADC side or DAC side * does the filter frequency need to be adjustable? Now you say you want 4th order. It's telling me you have requirements that call for a 4th order filter. But we don't know this requirements. I assume you already know that there is no ideal filter * A filter always causes amplitude- and phase errors at the passband. * and a filter always has a finite steepness at the stop band Thus the cutoff frequency (usually at -3dB ) needs to have some distance to yor frequency range of interest And the cutoff frequency needs to have some distance to the frequencies you want to suppress. Thus it's urgent that you first define your requiremens in values with units, no vague text. * pass band: min and max frequency, max amplitude error. Optional: phase requirements, setup time * Stop band: frequency range you want to suppress, and how much you need to attenuate them. Also tell us more about your application. Is it audio, or do you want to build a scope, do you have a fixed sample frequency, what resolution, what processing power, what's the input signal, what's the information you are interested in? Klaus Please don´t contact me via PM, because there is no time to respond to them. No friend requests. Thank you."

Step 2: release them into the open-source world and enjoy the chaos. Worries about deep fakes — machine-manipulated videos of celebrities and world leaders purportedly saying or doing things that they really didn’t — are quaint compared to a new threat: doctored images of the Earth itself. China is the acknowledged leader in using an emerging technique called generative adversarial networks to trick computers into seeing objects in landscapes or in satellite images that aren’t there, says Todd Myers, automation lead for the CIO-Technology Directorate at the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency. “The Chinese are well ahead of us. This is not classified info,” Myers said Thursday at the second annual Genius Machinessummit, hosted by Defense One and Nextgov. “The Chinese have already designed; they’re already doing it right now, using GANs—which are generative adversarial networks—to manipulate scenes and pixels to create things for nefarious reasons.” For example, Myers said, an adversary might fool your computer-assisted imagery analysts into reporting that a bridge crosses an important river at a given point. “So from a tactical perspective or mission planning, you train your forces to go a certain route, toward a bridge, but it’s not there. Then there’s a big surprise waiting for you,” he said. First described in 2014, GANs represent a big evolution in the way neural networks learn to see and recognize objects and even detect truth from fiction. Say you ask your conventional neural network to figure out which objects are what in satellite photos. The network will break the image into multiple pieces, or pixel clusters, calculate how those broken pieces relate to one another, and then make a determination about what the final product is, or, whether the photos are real or doctored. It’s all based on the experience of looking at lots of satellite photos. "

* The Constituent Assembly voted unanimously to strip Guaido of his immunity from prosecution.
* Venezuela's Supreme Court of Justice ordered the assembly to do so after Guaido violated an order banning him from leaving the country while under investigation.
* Under the constitution, withdrawing a lawmaker's immunity requires approval from the National Assembly. But the opposition-controlled chamber has not done endorsed the decision.

The Limits of participation?,www.cost-ofliving.net,,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.cost-ofliving.net/the-limits-of-participation/,"A Blog About Health In Times Of Austerity The limits of participation? by Ewen Speed Apr 3, 2019 Photo: Knights of the Round Table from Third1 Flickr Photostream
All policies which prioritise the need and value of public participation are underpinned by the idea of a democratic deficit. A democratic deficit can be defined as failings in the levels of accountability and transparency in the ongoing operation of government institutions. This idea underpins so much of the push for user involvement and participation in the public sector. From the commissioning of health and social care, through to public consultations on health and social care provision, the NHS constitution through to research funding streams.
The central idea is that there is a deficit in how much citizens can call to account, and influence, what government does. Many of the current policy structures, such as the drive to localism, are underpinned by claims that public involvement makes ongoing public decision making (around things like health and social care provision and spending), more transparent and accountable. Another central issue in this process is the idea that increased citizen participation will work to reduce the democratic deficit. Interestingly, I don’t think it is possible to ever arrive at a surplus of democracy, but we’ll leave that to one side. What I want to think through in my post is how this participation might practically work. I am not proposing answers to what are a range of complex issues, I simply want to raise a number of critical questions of what we are doing about participation, and what the implications of those actions might be.
Within all these participatory processes there are two fundamental assumptions which are directing how these processes operate. First, there is an assumption that a democratic deficit exists in how these processes are organised. Second, that citizen involvement in activities will re-dress this deficit and make the decisions required in providing health and social care more transparent and accountable. There is a further assumption contained within this second point that increased transparency and accountability is both possible and beneficial. I am not arguing they are not. But there is a need for us to be clear about the assumptions that underpin the framing of the problem because they play a role in determining what are deemed to be appropriate responses or solutions.
One question that is often left to one side when considering public participation is the issue of ethics. What are the ethics of participation in these contexts? In order to begin to think through this, I draw on the work of feminist critical theorist, Nancy Fraser . In tackling the ethics of participation Nancy Fraser gives the example of mixed-sex deliberative bodies. Fraser tells us that such mixed-sex meetings operate in ways that:
“men tend to interrupt women more than women interrupt men; men also tend to speak more than women, taking more turns and longer turns; and women’s interventions are more often ignored or not responded to than men’s” (Fraser, p.64).
So there are social processes and practices (in the case above this would be patriarchy) which influence the ways in which men and women are able to participate in meetings. One response to this disparity, or participation deficit, between men and women would be to find ways to organise meetings such that these advantages and disadvantages are removed or minimised. By finding ways to ‘bracket inequalities of status’ it should be possible for the meeting to proceed with a parity of participation assured for all speakers in the room. As Fraser says, it should be possible for everyone to: ‘set aside such characteristics as differences in birth and fortune and speak to one another as if they were social and economic peers.’
This gets to the crux of my post, how best to do this? If we revisit the meeting Fraser introduced previously, the key issue was that due to the structures of a patriarchal society there was an unequal distribution of power between men and women. If now we look at a slightly different unequal power dynamic, we could instead consider a division between health professionals and Patient and Public Involvement (PPI) representatives. Where does this get us?
“health professionals tend to interrupt PPI representatives more than PPI representatives interrupt health professionals; health professionals also tend to speak more than PPI representatives, taking more turns and longer turns; and PPI representative’s interventions are more often ignored or not responded to than health professional’s”.
Just as in the previous example, there are clear differences in the ways in which the two groups can participate in the meeting. Current participation and involvement policies in health and social care are clearly intended to prevent just such a scenario occurring. Both scenarios are underpinned by a prevailing range of social, cultural, political and economic preconditions which give one group disproportionate and inordinate power over another group. And in both cases, the unequal social and political distribution of power operates in subtle and often hidden ways.
This raises a question around whether bracketing these prevailing inequalities of status is doing enough to address these disproportionate and inordinate differences? Formally, in terms of the structure of the meeting, there are no barriers to participation, and everyone is entitled to speak equally. However, the enduring presence of inequalities based on gender, class, sexuality or ethnicity (to name but a few) and how they might impact upon discussions within the group are insufficiently considered. This raises a broader question about whether they might ever be considered sufficiently, and in enough depth and detail for parity of participation to be possible. In a system based on hierarchy there is never going to be equal involvement, and processes which try to address this deficit, need to address the fact that hierarchies will persist outside of the meeting.
Fraser argues this ideal of participation is overly optimistic. It involves too much difficult work across a range of diverse interests and actors. Rather the best way forward is to ask what form of public life comes closest to approaching the ideal of full parity of participation? If we are to take participation seriously then, Fraser argues, we need to ask what institutional arrangements will best ‘help narrow the gap in participatory parity between dominant and subordinate groups’?
Parity of participation. On the face of it, an eminently achievable and laudable goal. The oft-repeated mantra, utilised in the context of a parity of esteem between physical and mental health, of ‘nothing about us without us’ clearly sums up the moral case for involvement. This principle is not what is at issue in this post. However, a call for a parity of esteem between physical and mental health works to background ingrained and embedded social stigmas towards many mental health issues. My contention is that parity of esteem is not a strong enough position to counter these enduring and embedded stigmas – it does not do enough to counter the wider inequalities inherent in the social distribution of health and illness. In the context of my argument, a parity of esteem position might be of more use if the link were consistently and explicitly made in terms of the clear association between material disadvantage, poverty and levels of physical illness, psychiatric morbidity and mortality.
There is a very pressing need for a participatory approach which does not ignore the role of these factors in meaningful public participation. There is a need for practices which seeks to work beyond a simple commitment to something as nebulous as ‘parity’. For example, this could be accomplished by identifying ways in which the ‘bracketing of inequalities of status’ can have negative implications and consequences for citizens. By working through these difficult issues, and by seeking to bring the enduring (and often hidden) inequalities to the fore, and to then seek to address those inequalities, it may be possible to begin to move towards a truly progressive model of involvement."

The whole tax problem could be solved if the government collected everyone’s salaries then issued vouchers for food ,rent and other incidentals clothing vouchers could be issued every end of December. Christmas woukd be abolished . There would be no more complaints about tax then . Problem solved comrades . Politicians ,public employees and union officials would be exempt,naturally ,removing money from them would destroy their whole reason for living .and cause severe psychological damage . Bill Posters
Do you know the difference between an increase in tax and an increase in tax receipts? I think not. Paul
I am a big fan of Peta’s. Sooner she is elected into parliament and then the leadership the better. candy
The budget is to simply win the election with some reduced income tax and the $75 one-off payment. There’s not much point in dissecting it all too much.
The interesting thing is how much Bill Shorten will offer."
“fbi books on amazon” – Google News: Peter van Buren shows the path to RussiaGate – Fabius Maximus website,fabiusmaximus.com,mikenova,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://fabiusmaximus.com/2019/04/03/peter-van-buren-how-did-russiagate-begin/,"3 April 2019 3 April 2019
Summary: Here Peter van Buren gives the best summary I’ve seen of RussiaGate ‘s origins – by who, how, and why. RussiaGate has revealed much about the backstage operations of the US government (that is, revealed to those who look behind the news stories). Those insights are even more useful to us than details about RussiaGate itself. ID 77462338 © Pkanchana | Dreamstime. By Peter van Buren at his website, 30 March 2019. Posted with his generous permission. Some of the supporting links go to partisan sources, not news media.
The end of the Special Counsel’s investigation into the non-existent conspiracy between Trump and the Russians has created an army of “Mueller Truthers,” demanding additional investigations. But Republicans are also demanding to know more, specifically how the FBI came to look into collusion, and what that tells us about the tension between America’s political and intelligence worlds. In Rudy Giuliani’s words “Why did this ever start in the first place?”
The primordial ooze for all things Russia began in spring 2016 when the Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee, through a company called Fusion GPS, hired former MI6 intelligence agent Christopher Steele to compile a report (“the dossier”) on whatever ties to Russia he could find for Donald Trump.
Steele’s assignment was not to investigate impartially, but to gather dirt aggressively – opposition research, or oppo. He assembled second and third hand stories, then used anonymous sources and Internet chum to purported reveal Trump people roaming about Europe asking various Russians for help, promising sanctions relief, and trading influence for financial deals. Steele also claimed the existence of a “pee tape,” kompromat Putin used to control Trump.
Creating the dossier was only half of Steele’s assignment. The real work was to insert the dossier into American media and intelligence organizations to prevent Trump from winning the election. While only a so-so fiction writer, Steele proved to be a master at running his information op against America.
In July 2016 Steele met with over a dozen reporters to promote his dossier, with little success. It could not be corroborated. Steele succeeded mightily, however, in pushing his information deep into the FBI via three simultaneous channels, including the State Department , and via Senator John McCain , who was pitched by a former British ambassador retired to work now for Christopher Steele’s own firm . Hopes of the RussiaGaters!
But the most productive channel into the FBI was Department of Justice official Bruce Ohr . Ohr’s wife Nellie worked for Fusion GPS, the front company for Steele, having previously done contract work for the CIA. Nellie passed the dossier to her husband, along with her own paid oppo research , so that he could use his credibility at DOJ to hand-carry the work into the FBI. Bruce Ohr, despite acknowledging it broke all rules of protocol and evidence handling, did just that on July 30, 2016 . He stressed to then-FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe the material was uncorroborated and had been compiled by Christopher Steele, who wanted it used to stop Trump.
The dossier landed in welcoming hands. The FBI immediately opened an unprecedented investigation called Crossfire Hurricane into the Trump campaign. It sent agents to London to meet Australian ambassador Alexander Downer, who claimed to have evidence George Papadopoulos, one of Trump’s junior-level advisers, was talking to Russians about Hillary’s emails. The FBI’s timing of the new investigation into Trump – only days after they closed their investigation into Clinton’s email server – can be considered a coincidence by those of good heart.
Peter Strzok, the senior FBI agent managing the Crossfire Hurricane investigation, and Lisa Page , a lawyer on his team (the two were also lovers), purposefully kept investigation details from political appointees at DOJ to the extent that only five people actually knew the full measure of what was going on, ostensibly to prevent leaks .
In fact, the point seems to have been to avoid oversight, given how weak the evidence was supporting something as grave as the Republican nominee committing treason. If you are looking behind the headlines for why Trump fired Andrew McCabe, besides his personal sympathies for Hillary, look there. Strzok and Page appear to have had an agenda of their own. In a text they wrote “Page: ‘[Trump’s] not ever going to become president, right? Strzok: ‘No. No he’s not. We’ll stop it.’”
With a wave of a hand the dossier the FBI was warned was partisan bunk was transformed into evidence. Steele himself morphed from paid opposition researcher to paid clandestine source for the FBI, with the fact that he had recently retired from a foreign intelligence service, British or not, ignored. It was all just an excuse anyway to unleash the vast intelligence machine against Trump, the imagined Manchurian Candidate .
Papadopoulos, the man in London, as a linchpin was also preposterous. He was a kid on the edges of the campaign, who “bumped into” a shady Russian professor who just happened to dangle the most explosive thing ever, Hillary’s emails. Papadopoulos then met the Aussie ambassador to Britain, Alex Downer. Papadopoulos gets drunk, tells the tale, which then falls whole into the FBI’s lap. Ambassador Downer, by the way, had previously arranged a $25 million donation to the Clinton Foundation. Papadopoulos was introduced to Downer by an Australian intelligence agent who knew him through her boyfriend, stationed at the Israeli embassy as a “political officer.”
Carter Page’s case was more of the same. Page, as a key actor in the Steele dossier, wold serve as an early excuse to get FISA surveillance eyes and ears on the Trump campaign. The FBI had a paid CIA asset, University of Cambridge professor and American citizen Stefan A. Halper , contact Page and dangle questions about access to Clinton emails.
Halper had earlier been trying separately to entrap Papadopoulos (the professor offered the inexperienced campaign aide $3,000 and an all-expenses-paid trip to London to write a white paper about energy), and also met with Trump campaign co-chair Sam Clovis in late August, offering his services as an adviser. Clovis declined. Ultimately both Papadopoulos and Page also rebuffed Halper, though both would later encounter a young woman in London claiming to be Halper’s assistant who tried to reinterest the boys.
Though to obtain multiple FISA warrants the FBI characterized him as an “agent of a foreign power,” Carter Page was never charged with anything. Halper dropped off the media’s radar, but is almost certainly a U.S. intelligence asset. He had earlier worked with British intelligence to pay for Michael Flynn to visit the UK. Halper’s main U.S.-based funding source is an internal Pentagon think tank. The Washington Post reported Halper had in the past worked for CIA directly. Halper was implicated in a 1980s spying scandal in which CIA officials gave inside information on the Carter administration to the GOP. Halper also married into a senior CIA official’s family.
It is clear the FBI was desperately trying to infiltrate Halper into the Trump campaign as part of a full-blown intel op, recruiting against Trump’s vulnerable junior staff. Even though the recruitment failed, the bits and pieces learned in the process were good enough for government work. At issue was that Steele’s dossier formed a key argument in favor of a FISA warrant to spy on Trump personnel. The dossier was corroborated in part in the warrant application by citing news reports that later turned out to be themselves based on the Steele dossier. In intelligence work, this is known as cross-contamination, a risky amateur error the FBI seems to have taken a chance on hoping the FISA judge would not know enough to question it. The gamble worked.
The FBI needed something as backup, so their investigation into Trump, now focused on the FISA surveillance, could be said not to have rested entirely on the dubious Steele dossier. Surveillance, intended and incidental , would eventually include Jeff Sessions , Steve Bannon , Carter Page , Paul Manafort , Richard Gates , Michael Cohen , and likely Trump himself .
Had Hillary won the story would have ended there, in fact, likely would never have come to light. But with Trump’s victory, the dossier had one more job to do: prep the public for all to come.
There has been no discussion as to why, in possession of information the FBI seemed to believe showed the Russians were running a global full-court press to themselves recruit inside Trump’s inner circle, Trump was never offered a defensive briefing . Such a warning – hey, you are in danger – is common inside government. But in Trump’s case it never happened. Instead, in echo of the dark Hoover years, the FBI used its information to try and take down Trump, not protect him.
Though the dossier had already been widely shared inside the media, the State Department, and the intelligence community, it was only on January 6, 2017 Comey briefed it to president-elect Trump. No one really knows what was said in that meeting, but we do know after holding the dossier since summer 2016, only four days after the Trump-Comey meeting Buzzfeed published the document and the world learned about the pee tape. Many believe someone in the intel community “ gave permission ” to the media, signaling Brennan, Clapper, Hayden, et al, would begin making public statements the dossier “could be true.”
John Brennan was a regular on television and other media claiming over two years there was evidence of contacts between the Russian government and the Trump campaign, pimping off his time as CIA director to suggest he had inside information. He went as far as testifying before Congress in May 2017 that there was evidence of contacts between Russian officials and Trump campaign figures, though now says he might have been given “bad information.”
After that, no item that could link the words Trump and Russia was too small to add to the pile of pseudo-evidence.
It would be easy to dismiss all this as a wacky conspiracy theory if it wasn’t in fact the counter-explanation to the even wackier, disproved theory Donald Trump was a Russian asset. It is possible to see Russiagate as a political assassination attempt, using law enforcement as the weapon. Someone might do well to double-check if Christopher Steele was in Dealey Plaza during the Kennedy assassination. - Editor’s note
Van Buren’s summary obscures what is, imo, the most important part of the RussiaGate: the fantastic implausibility of the Steele dossier. He describes the greatest intel coup, ever – Russia had a leading candidate for President of the United States in the bag. How did Steele get this info from Russian officials? What could he offer in exchange? Nobody seems to have asked if they were executed quickly – or slowly. Or promoted (for inserting divisive agitprop into US politics).
The details of this story has received little criticism. The obvious reason why is that it was too useful to question. It met the needs of power elements of the Democratic Party, their journalist supporters, and the Deep State. So it was accepted despite its weirdness and near-total lack of confirming evidence. That alone reveals much about how America is governed: they rely on our apathy. About the author

The American Church’s Complicity in Racism: A Conversation with Jemar Tisby,religionandpolitics.org,Eric C. Miller,04-02-2019,2019,4,https://religionandpolitics.org/2019/04/02/the-american-churchs-complicity-in-racism-a-conversation-with-jemar-tisby/,"Print (AP) An overflow crowd stands outside the funeral services for three of the four black girls killed in the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing in Birmingham, Alabama, in 1963.
T he fraught racial history of the United States has infiltrated and influenced all of its institutions, including the Christian church. Though certain figures and movements did join the struggle against slavery, segregation, and violence at various times and places, the majority of white American Christendom fell somewhere on the spectrum between open endorsement and quiet acceptance. Today, as debates over racism continue to dominate our national conversations and controversies, religious influence remains central to the context.
In his new book, The Color of Compromise , Jemar Tisby surveys this history with an eye toward the innumerable moments when white American Christians could have interceded on behalf of racial justice, but did not. Taken together, he argues, from the founding of the United States to the present, these moments constitute an ignominious timeline spanning four centuries of suffering, so that today’s headlines are connected to seemingly ancient atrocities. By the end, it is clear that past and current events retain a striking similarity regarding the church and race.
Eric C. Miller spoke with Tisby about the book recently by phone. Their conversation has been lightly edited for clarity and length.
R&P: As the subtitle states, your book is a sweeping survey of the American church’s complicity in racism. To your mind, what constitutes complicity?
Jemar Tisby: The book opens with the story of four girls who died when the 16th Street Baptist Church was bombed in Birmingham, Alabama, in 1963. Shortly after that event, a white lawyer named Charles Morgan Jr. got up in front of an all-white business club and gave an address in which he asked who was responsible for throwing that bomb. In answer to his own question, he said, “We all did it.”
He went on to explain that every time that the white community—especially Christians—failed to confront racism in its everyday, mundane forms, they created a context of compromise that allowed for an extreme act of racial terror like planting dynamite at a church. That’s the idea of complicity. It’s not that every Christian was a foaming-at-the-mouth racist hurling racial slurs and burning crosses on peoples’ lawns. It’s that when they had the opportunity to intervene in everyday ways, they chose complicity over confrontation, and this enabled a larger atmosphere of racial compromise.
R&P: Though some American Christians were enthusiastically racist and others were anti-racist, most just accepted racist institutions. To what extent are we free to judge that, and to what extent do we have to accept them as products of their time?
JT: I think some would argue that most of those who I am identifying as complicit in racism were merely men and women of their time. But I would respond that the abolitionists and civil rights activists and others who struggled for black freedom were also men and women of their time. So it’s not as though Christians—particularly white Christians—didn’t know there were alternatives. It’s that they must have had some investment in maintaining the status quo, or that they had some fear of what other people would say or what they would risk if they stood up for racial equality.
R&P: Was the situation in the South markedly different from that in the North?
JT: A lot of people like to point a finger at the South and say, “Those are the real racists.” The implication is that there is no comparable problem in the Midwest or the West coast or the Northeast. But the reality is much more complicated than that.
I purposely included a chapter in the book on Christian complicity in the North, and by North I mean anywhere outside of the South. There are examples from various geographic regions. The bottom line is that bigotry knows no boundaries. It’s not that racism stopped at the Mason-Dixon line. The thing that makes the South stand out is that this was the physical site where race-based chattel slavery occurred. It’s the place where the plantations were located. But the entire country was implicated because the agricultural production in the South fueled industrial production in the North and other parts of the United States.
Later, when the country played host to race riots—and here I mean white race riots—these occurred in urban areas outside of the South, like Chicago, St. Louis, Los Angeles, and others in the Northeast as well. So there was no region that was free from complicity and no region that was free from racism.
R&P: As the nation moved from slavery to Jim Crow to redlining and mass incarceration, did the church response reveal any sort of moral trajectory? Did it get noticeably better or worse over time?
JT: Martin Luther King Jr. once said that, when it came to issues of justice, the church was often the taillight rather than the headlight in society. By that, he meant that the church often followed along after changes in the racial status quo were already taking place in different arenas, from politics to entertainment to corporations, and that’s what we often see throughout U.S. history. Though many Christians were actively engaged in struggles for racial equality, they tended to be in the minority. The majority of white Christians, at least, did change, but only as the national sentiment was already moving toward more openness and more equality. The change was slow and a little reluctant.
Consider G.T. Gillespie, for example. In 1954, the year of the Brown v. Board of Education ruling, Gillespie was president emeritus of Belhaven College, and he gave an address called “A Christian View on Segregation,” in which he justified racial segregation, he said, based on the Bible. It’s just one example of many white evangelical Christians fighting against the political changes that would promote racial integration.
It was only after Brown v. Board that many Christians capitulated to what was already the law of the land. But there was a disappointing scarcity of Christians who were promoting racial integration or celebrating the end of Jim Crow.
R&P: How did the ascendance of the Christian Right affect the broader church’s positions on race?
JT: If you look at the historical record, it appears that conservative political operatives capitalized on fears and social stances on race that were already present. So it’s not as though politicians had to invent and promote racial fears to white audiences. Those were already there—both overt and covert—within white Christianity.
Rather, the Christian Right marked a coalescence of factors and an intersection of interests, whereby conservative Christians united within a single political party that was becoming nationally ascendant, especially after the election of Ronald Reagan in 1980.
R&P: You cite white evangelicals’ support for Donald Trump and their disapproval of Black Lives Matter as instances of modern-day complicity. Have white evangelical readers been receptive to this critique?
JT: Some have been receptive. I think the evidence is in the fact that many more white Christians are talking about issues of justice than in years past.
Ferguson and Black Lives Matter have started a conversation that goes beyond racial integration—and this actually has echoes from the civil rights and Black Power movements a half a century ago—making it apparent, first, that there were deep rifts between black and white Christians, even among those who were worshipping in the same congregations and, second, that our racial chasm could not be bridged simply by knowing people from different races. In other words, the institutional aspects of racism cannot be solved merely through interpersonal relationships. I think there are more and more Christians who are pondering that—and better late than never.
R&P: Early in the book, you predict that many readers will dismiss your argument, and that they will do so via a series of objections that have long been used to defend the status quo. Has that prediction come true?
JT: It has absolutely come true, and I see more clearly now than before, what activists in the 1950s and 60s must have felt when they received criticism from their religious brothers and sisters. The argument is that any talk of social justice is a distraction from what Christians should be focused on, which is the gospel. Throughout history, Christian activists have always asserted that this is an artificial separation—that the two go together. So if you read the comments on some reviews of the book, or on social media posts promoting it, you see some of the same criticisms now that were made in response to activists throughout American history. The main objection to The Color of Compromise has to do with whether Christians should be involved in these topics at all. It reflects, in my view, an over-spiritualizing of the Christian faith that ignores physical, material concerns like poverty, mass incarceration, voting rights, and other important issues.
R&P: You write, “Racism never goes away. It adapts.” That conclusion is certainly supported by the book. But if it’s true, then what gives you hope for a better, more egalitarian future?
JT: The gospel gives me hope. As a believer, I understand that one day, all things will be made right and every tear will be dried. But in a more immediate sense, I have trained my eyes to look for hope in unexpected places. Oftentimes, when we assess the state of race relations in the American church, we look to the big institutions and the big denominations, and the reality is that large organizations are very slow to change. Sometimes they don’t change on a broad scale. So I look for change on the smaller scale, at the congregational level, or a small group of people who have decided to come together and read this book, or to protest in solidarity with immigrants. I look for stories of transformation, in which people who were raised with a certain belief system are now expanding their views to see that racism is still a problem, and that they might play a small role in bringing about justice. Now, these don’t solve the problem by any means, but they show me that there are people who care, and that they care enough to act. And that’s what gives me hope."

Justin and Hailey (née Baldwin) Bieber’s marriage happened hastily last year, so it wasn’t hard to believe when Justin announced Hailey’s pregnancy on Instagram. It was, however, equally unsurprising when he revealed that it was merely an April Fools prank. Fans of the star couple didn’t take the joke lightly, some citing Justin’s insensitivity toward people who can’t get have children. Today, he half-apologized with another Instagram post.
“There’s always gonna be people offended, there’s also people who don’t take jokes very well, I am a prankster and it was APRIL FOOLS,” he wrote. “I didn’t at all mean to be insensitive to people who can’t have children.”
“It’s like when I shoved cake in my little sisters face for her birthday expecting her to laugh but she cried,” the caption continued. “You sometimes just don’t know what will hurt someone’s feelings not to compare pregnancy with cake in the face but it’s just to paint the picture of not knowing what will offend.”

But I will apologize anyway and take responsibility and say sorry to people who were offended. I truly don’t want anyone to be hurt by a prank.. it’s like when I shoved cake in my little sisters face for her birthday expecting her to laugh but she cried.

Arab residents of Jericho have reportedly looted second temple-era caves on the outskirts of the city.The caves form part of an extensive burial ground of what's believed to be a Hasmonean palace, which was discovered in the area recently after agricultural and landscaping work was being done by local Arab farmers, according to a statement by right-wing NGO Regavim. Professor Rachel Hachlili of Haifa University's Zinman Institute of Archaeology, who studied this region, noted that these caves are the largest Second Temple-era burial ground in Israel.Preserving the Eternal said that hikers came across the scene where they found bones and human remains strewn all over, while the catacombs had been badly ransacked and looted of any valubles. It was also discovered that the sarcophagi (burial caskets) that had been resting in the caves for more than 2,500 years had disappeared.According to the statement, antiquities theft and destruction of archaeological treasures is a rampant phenomana, which has alomost become common practice throughout Judea and Samaria. ""In this case, ancient catacombs were wiped out by illegal looting despite the constant stream of alerts, warnings, and documentation sent to the Regional Commander for Antiquities in the Civil Administration, the body responsible for law enforcement in the area,"" the organization said.Yakhin Zik, Regavim director of operations said “the loss of our archaeological record and the ongoing failure to protect and preserve our heritage is an incomprehensible disgrace. The [Israeli] government must approve additional manpower and create standards that will ensure the preservation of antiquities and the severe punishment of looters.”He added that this is not the first time that the theft of antiquities and the destruction of archeological properties are taking place in the region. ""Another burial cave was removed from the face of the earth by illegal quarrying in the area, despite numerous warnings to the Civil Administration that the area is in constant danger,"" he said.Speaking on behalf of ""Preserving the Eternal"", Moshe Gutman said that ""the time has come for those who make declarations about their commitment to our national legacy to open their eyes to the ISIS-style destruction that is happening all around us.""""I call upon the prime minister to take responsibility. It is inconceivable that a civilized country tolerates the plunder and devastation of word cultural heritage sites,” Gutman concluded.

ANKARA - Turkey's High Election Board ruled on Wednesday in favor of a recount in seven of Istanbul's 39 districts after an initial count showed the main opposition candidate earned a narrow victory in the city's local election.President Tayyip Erdogan's AK Party submitted objections to election results in all districts of Turkey's commercial hub Istanbul and capital Ankara as initial results showed it was on course to lose control of both cities. The election setback may complicate Erdogan's efforts to combat the economy's slide into recession.On Tuesday, the provincial election board in Istanbul had halted a recount sought by the AKP in seven Istanbul districts in response to a challenge by the main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP).However the High Election Board (YSK) ruled overnight that the recount of what had been ruled as invalid votes should go ahead in the districts of Sile, Bayrampasa, Atasehir, Umraniye, Beykoz, Fatih and Gaziosmanpasa.In Istanbul, the mayoral candidate of the main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP), Ekrem Imamoglu, and his AKP rival, ex-prime minister Binali Yildirim, both said on Monday Imamoglu was around 25,000 votes ahead. Istanbul's population is 15 million, according to official data.The AKP filed challenges to results throughout the two cities after saying it would use its right to object to the results where there were voting irregularities, adding that errors at the ballots had affected the outcome.Ahead of the elections, the CHP had formed an electoral alliance with the Iyi (Good) Party to rival that of the AKP and their nationalist MHP partners. The alliances nominated joint candidates in certain cities, including Ankara and Istanbul.In Ankara, Yavas received 50.9 percent of votes in Sunday's vote, ahead of his AKP rival and former minister Mehmet Ozhaseki by nearly 4 percentage points.Pro-government newspapers on Wednesday said there had been a conspiracy against Turkey in the local elections, with the Star newspaper likening this to an attempted military coup in 2016 and nationwide protests in 2013.""Who organized the coup at the ballot box,"" the front-page headline in Star said. ""They wanted to take over the national will through organized theft and cheating methods,"" it added.Yeni Safak newspaper editor Ibrahim Karagul also described the elections as a ""coup via elections"" and that supporters of the US-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom Ankara says carried out the 2016 putsch, were involved.Karagul said the Istanbul election should be held again.

"Lori Lightfoot, Chicago’s New Mayor, Promises Change, Confronts ‘Massive’ Challenges",www.governing.com,Alan Greenblatt,04-02-2019,2019,4,https://www.governing.com/topics/politics/gov-Lori-Lightfoot-Chicago-Mayor-Promises-Change-Confronts-Massive-Challenges.html,"Politics & Elections Lori Lightfoot, Chicago’s New Mayor, Promises Change, Confronts ‘Massive’ Challenges No black woman or openly gay individual has led a city as large as Chicago. She will have to confront chronic budget shortfalls, population loss and a high murder rate. by Alan Greenblatt | April 2, 2019 AT 9:30 PM Lori Lightfoot has not previously held elected office, but she has been active in Chicago legal and government circles for years. (AP/Teresa Crawford)
By winning election as Chicago's new mayor on Tuesday, Lori Lightfoot has made history. No black woman has led an American city as large as Chicago.
“The prospect of having an African American female in the third-largest city is pretty much of a big, big deal,” says Karen Freeman-Wilson, a black woman who is mayor of nearby Gary, Ind.
Lightfoot’s opponent in the runoff was Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle, guaranteeing that a black woman would be elected to succeed Rahm Emanuel, who opted not to seek a third term. RELATED Powerful Chicago Democrat Charged in Federal Corruption Case In Historic Race, Chicago Poised to Elect First African-American Woman as Mayor
With the election of Kate Gallego in Phoenix last month, two of the nation’s five largest cities will now have woman mayors. “There are very few women in the top 100 cities, let alone the top 10,” says Andrea Benjamin, an expert on urban politics at the University of Missouri.
Lightfoot also will be the first openly gay individual to lead a city as large as Chicago. “I’ve teased her about the fact that I’ll be giving her the crown,” says former Houston Mayor Annise Parker, who had previously held that distinction. Parker now heads the Victory Fund, which supports LGBT candidates. “I’m excited about it. Records are made to be broken.”
Demographic breakthroughs aside, Lightfoot campaigned on the theme of bringing change to Chicago’s city hall. In the first round of voting in February, Lightfoot and Preckwinkle both finished ahead of William Daley, the race's top fundraiser, whose brother and father had each served more than 20 years as Chicago mayor.
When she entered the race, Lightfoot was a relatively unknown underdog, but she won a sweeping victory. She took 74 percent of the vote on Tuesday, carrying all 50 of the city's wards. Although turnout was a record-low 32 percent, Lightfoot claimed a ""mandate for change"" in her victory speech.
She takes office at a time when city politics is operating under a series of dark clouds. On March 21, Alderman Willie Cochran pleaded guilty to wire fraud, bringing to 30 the total number of Chicago aldermen convicted of corruption since 1972.
In January, Ed Burke, a longtime power broker on the board of aldermen, was charged in an extortion case. Another alderman, Danny Solis, is known to have worn a wire for two years as part of a federal investigation.
“All of them reinforced the theme of corruption and the need for change,” says Dick Simpson, a former alderman who teaches at the University of Illinois at Chicago. “It was a campaign about change over the status quo.”
Lightfoot has been active in Chicago legal and government circles for years, but has never before held elective office. She was able to position herself not only as a political outsider, but as someone who prosecuted an alderman as an assistant U.S. attorney.
“For the first time since 1983, when Harold Washington was elected mayor, a kind of remarkable outside figure has landed in the mayor’s office on the fifth floor of city hall,"" says Larry Bennett, a retired political scientist at DePaul University, referring to Chicago’s first African American mayor.
Preckwinkle, by contrast, has been running for office in Chicago for three decades and currently serves as the Cook County Democratic Party chair. Although never tainted by wrongdoing herself, she found herself having to answer questions about Burke hosting a fundraiser for her last year at his home and the county having hired his son for a job.
Preckwinkle had to fight hard against the old Chicago Democratic machine to win a seat on the board of aldermen back in the 1990s, but she came to be seen as part of the establishment at a moment of change.
“Preckwinkle is by no means a product of the quote, Chicago machine, unquote, but she’s gotten herself perceived that way, and that’s hurt her,” Bennett says. The Mayor’s Personal Story
Lightfoot’s parents were Southerners who moved north to Ohio. Her father, who had worked as a sharecropper in Arkansas, fell ill and was in a coma when Lightfoot was born. Her mother was a housekeeper who won election to the local school board. “Lori Lightfoot is able to tell this wonderful personal story,” Bennett says. “She’s a woman from a hardscrabble family in Massillon, Ohio.”
Lightfoot attended law school at the University of Chicago. She worked for the megafirm Mayer Brown but also served as a federal prosecutor and held city posts in the procurement and emergency management departments. Mayor Emanuel appointed her as president of the Chicago police board, as well as head of a task force that examined police practices following the murder of a black teenager named Laquan McDonald by a police officer.
Lightfoot’s lack of elective experience was a subject of criticism for Preckwinkle and other rivals, who said that being mayor was not an entry-level job. That complaint didn’t seem to resonate with voters ready for fresh leadership.
In the end, Lightfoot was endorsed by nearly all of the dozen mayoral candidates who were outpaced in the runoff. None supported Preckwinkle, although she did win some endorsements from unions and local black leaders. Identity, Not Issues
Despite the negative and sometimes personal campaign between Lightfoot and Preckwinkle, there wasn’t a lot of difference between them on issues such as affordable housing, police reform or spreading Chicago’s wealth out from the lakefront to more distressed neighborhoods.
Someone distributed homophobic fliers late in the campaign, though Preckwinkle’s camp denied any knowledge.
“The identity politics matter,” says Benjamin, the University of Missouri political scientist, who followed the election in Chicago closely. “In terms of issues, it was hard to distinguish them in some ways, which opens it up for these identity politics to come into play.”
Neither candidate had much of substance to say about what’s likely to be the biggest challenge facing the new mayor, namely Chicago’s ongoing budget problems. The city’s budget shortfall is expected to be $252 million, and it is on the hook for $276 million in payments next year for its chronically underfunded pensions.
Lightfoot chose not to get too specific during the campaign about the package of spending cuts and revenue increases the new mayor will likely have to present in her first budget. “It’s going to be painful, whatever combination is used to deal with the financial issue,” says Simpson, the University of Illinois at Chicago political scientist. Chicago’s Crisis of Civic Confidence
Later this month, the board of alderman will get to work, choosing its new committee chairs. An unusually large slate of progressive newcomers was elected to the board this year, although they won’t make up a majority.
The board as a whole, however, is not expected to practice the same brand of old guard resistance to the new mayor that Harold Washington faced, a racially-polarized battle of wills that became known as the “council wars.”
“I don’t think Lightfoot is going to face any kind of opposition like Washington faced, an organized opposition that says we don’t like you and we don’t like your agenda,” says Bennett, the DePaul political scientist.
Lightfoot faces the difficult task of translating her promises of change into a governing agenda. The city faces not only structural deficit problems, but a crisis of civic confidence. Emanuel was accused of constructing a tale of two cities, with the Loop and the lakefront enjoying record investment even as neighborhoods in the city’s southern and western edges suffered school closings and high murder rates.
Lightfoot will have to square her desire to curb abuses by the police with the real need for protection in a city that saw more murders last year than New York and Los Angeles combined, although the numbers of killings and violent crime both came down. Lightfoot said during the campaign that her plan to help ex-offenders reintegrate into society had been informed by her own family’s experience, since her older brother spent much of his life in prison.
Despite its many areas of success, Chicago is the only large city in the country that’s losing population. Knitting together its disparate communities and achieving a greater sense of equity among them, while trying to stop the fiscal bleeding at city hall, will keep Lightfoot busy for the next four years, at least.
“Just like the Harold Washington election was major in Chicago’s history, I think this will be a major watershed,” Simpson says. “Not just because she’s the first black woman gay mayor of Chicago, but the issues we’re confronting and the changes that will be made will be very massive.”"
The Teamwork That Drives a Great Civic Project,www.governing.com,Otis White,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.governing.com/columns/smart-mgmt/col-leadership-drives-great-civic-project-buffalo-niagara-medical-campus.html,"COMMENTARY | Smart Management The Teamwork That Drives a Great Civic Project As Buffalo's former mayor demonstrated, to bring the right people together you have to know what it takes to make a project succeed. April 3, 2019 AT 6:15 AM (Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus) By Otis White | Contributor President of Civic Strategies Inc.
The Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus in Buffalo, N.Y., is so successful today, it's hard to imagine it didn't always exist. But it dates only to 2002, when five institutions agreed to collaborate in planning their adjacent properties and recruiting others to join them on the 120-acre campus.
How successful has BNMC been? Matt Enstice, its president and CEO, recites the numbers off the top of his head: from 4.5 million square feet in 2002 to 9 million today; from 7,500 employees to 16,000; from five institutions to nine anchor institutions plus 150 nonprofits and companies. Fueling all this has been $1.4 billion in private and public investment.
So when Enstice and others began talking about the campus idea in 1999, everyone could see its merits, right? Well, no. The five original institutions -- a hospital, a cancer research and treatment center, a university, an independent research institute, and a large medical practice -- didn't exactly oppose the idea, but they weren't convinced it would work, either. RELATED 7 Elements of Great Civic Projects How a Smart Mayor Can Harness the Strength of a Nonprofit Houston's Mayor Loves to Make Deals. Not Everybody’s Happy. In Government, There's a Big Difference Between Power and Leadership The Art of Governing Through Questions
""It took a huge amount of volunteer time"" to get the medical campus idea off the ground, said one of the founders, Tom Beecher, an attorney and veteran civic leader. Assurances were made to the institutions: This would not be a governance organization and would not replace existing boards. Skeptical neighborhood organizations had to be convinced that these institutions would welcome their ideas. Foundations and political interests had to be persuaded.
And then there was the sheer weight of cynicism. You see, the idea of a medical campus in Buffalo wasn't a new one in 1999. It had been tried before. Several times. At one point, Enstice gathered all the failed plans. ""I had a stack of plans up to my waist,"" he remembers, ""and I'm six feet tall.""
So how did Enstice, Beecher, then-Mayor Anthony Masiello and consultant Richard Reinhard turn the idea of a collaborative, entrepreneurial medical campus from repeated failure to success? They did it the way great civic leaders always do these things: They saw the way forward, creating not just a plan but a strategy. That's a critical distinction. Lots of people, it seems, are good at creating plans, but it's a rare leader who knows how to move from plan to reality.
This was the case in Buffalo in the 1990s, where many could see the city's needs. (A big one: What could replace our fading manufacturing economy?) Some could even see solutions. (How about building around one of our bright spots, the city's medical and biosciences economy … perhaps by centering it in a campus?)
But only an experienced and respected leader could see how to put the pieces together by assembling a team of planners, advocates and strategists, anticipating the objections they would face, shaping the arguments, finding money for starting the effort, identifying early wins, and building momentum.
Fortunately, Buffalo had such a leader in Mayor Masiello. His talents lay in three areas: He had relationships with the right people, he knew how government worked and what it could do, and he was a natural cheerleader. He also had a good sense of timing. He recognized that, in 1999, there were changes in the leadership of the local medical community, so there was a little more openness to trying something new.
Masiello's first step was probably the most important one. He picked the right people for the project. Beecher had deep relationships in the philanthropic and health-care communities (he had chaired one of the hospital boards). Enstice and Reinhard (who had been Masiello's chief of staff) were natural organizers with a deep understanding of communities. And Masiello was comfortable leading from behind, as cheerleader, early funder and remover of political obsta-cles.
Along the way, these four made smart tactical choices. Example: How they invited people into the planning effort. Their rule: You could participate only if you brought money, which they called ""skin in the game."" This built commitment to the project and cleared out the time-wasters and political hangers-on who had bogged down earlier efforts. Another example: When they created the BNMC board, they suggested that each of the large institutions have two representatives, one of whom must be the institution's chair. Their thinking: While the CEO would be focused on the institution, the chair would have a longer, broader view of the city's wellbeing. Again, it built commitment to the idea of a collaborative campus.
There were a half-dozen other things the team did well, from finding and exploiting early wins to involving the neighborhoods in exactly the right way. Knowing that Buffalo is, as Masiello puts it, a ""seeing-is-believing town,"" they led leadership tours of successful medical campuses around the country.
But none of this would have been possible without the decisions made early on by Mayor Masiello: When is the right time to get started? Who are the right people to lead this effort? What obstacles will they face? And how can I help them succeed?"

Another guide will be published for chlamydia, as these three STIs become more and more prevalent in Belgium.""The number of STI cases is climbing alarmingly in Belgium, as in the rest of the world, "" warns KCE. Chlamydia, gonorrhoea and syphilis are the three first places on the podium.Chlamydia infection, diagnosed mainly in young women, accounts for half of all new STIs. Thus, the number of cases of chlamydia rose from 9.1 per 100,000 inhabitants in 2002 to 60.1 per 100,000 inhabitants in 2016. Syphilis is also gaining ground since with 46 cases in 2002 compared to 943 in 2016.These diseases usually go unnoticed, preventing treatment and thus promoting their spread. However, they can lead to serious complications, infertility or repeated miscarriages says the centre. To make matters worse, while these STIs can be treated with antibiotics, increased resistance ""due to irresponsible use of these drugs"" make its treatment more difficult. The Brussels Times"

"A warning for democracy, not a eulogy",www.brusselstimes.com,,04-03-2019,2019,4,http://www.brusselstimes.com/opinion/14777/a-warning-for-democracy-not-an-eulogy,"A warning for democracy, not a eulogy Tuesday, 02 April 2019 16:53 Alicja Gescinska Alicja Gescinska is a Belgian-Polish philosopher and novelist. Thierry Baudet founder and leader of the right wing political party Forum for Democracy voting at a polling station in Amsterdam, March 20, 2019. Share on Facebook Share on Twitter ‘A blow of the hammer.’ That is how Dutch writer and essayist Bas Heijne captured the sentiment prevailing among many Dutch after the recent elections. Forum for Democracy (FvD) came out of the Provincial States elections as the country’s biggest party. FvD is a text-book, right-wing populist party. Many fear we are witnessing the end of democracy, or at least the beginning of the end. All across the globe populists are on the rise, most visibly on the right, attempting to undermine the pillars of democracy: freedom, solidarity, toleration, non-discrimination, respect. Now even the Netherlands – renowned for their love of liberty and their talent for tolerance – are haunted by the spectre of populism.One must however be cautious not to draw too preliminary and one-sided conclusions about the state of Dutch democracy. The political landscape is quite fragmented, and it has definitely not been a landslide victory. The party of current prime minister Mark Rutte managed to minimize the loss, and will lose one seat in the First Chamber. The heaviest blows have been delivered to the Christian-Democrats, the left-wing liberals, and also to Geert Wilder’s PVV. Hence, the rise of FvD coincides with the decline of Wilder’s extreme-right, anti-Islam party. The Dutch are definitely not on the populist path to illiberal democracy. Holland will not soon become a Hungary by the North Sea, or a Poland in the polders. The opposition to FvD is much stronger than its support. Therefore, we must not panic, but we must be deeply concerned. Here are a few reasons why. Savior of civilization We are beginning to get familiar with the populist strategy. FvD has meticulously and diligently followed the text-book. There is the use of a false dichotomy between the elite and the people. ‘The elite’ is being blamed for betraying their own country, while the party leaders of FvD themselves of course happily belong to the elite they pretend to despise. There is the praise for Putin and authoritarian figures. There is climate-change denial, fact-free politics and a whole bunch of alternative truths and complete lies. There is the overly one-sided anti-immigration perspective, with immigrants and the EU getting blame for problems they hardly have anything to do with. Nostalgia And then there is the one sin I find unforgivable: the exploitation of nostalgia. Where once nostalgia was a sweet sentiment of sadness, synonymous with the music of Chopin and the poems of Alan Tate, it is now a political instrument. Nostalgo-nationalist rhetoric is a key component of the populist strategy. Thierry Baudet, founder of FvD, sees himself as a savior, ‘standing on the ruins of what was once the best of civilizations.’ Sexism Sexism too is a recurrent leitmotiv in the right-wing populist’s strategy. And it is also present in FvD. Baudet is the author of a novel that is bad in so many ways, not least because of the misogyny that sprouts from every page. Evidently, a writer is not responsible for the horrible things his characters do or say. But in interviews Baudet does little to sharpen the line between fiction and reality. He has shown a remarkable willingness to claim on camera, without a slightest hint of hesitation, that women are, by their very own nature, less competent in most jobs, obedient and not really capable of thinking for themselves either. While the world is full of advocates of gender equality, we must not turn a blind eye to a group that is getting increasingly louder: those who openly challenge rights and capabilities of women. It isn’t hard to see that the effect on society in general and the labour market in particular of having political leaders voicing such views and mainstreaming them is likely to be quite damaging. A lost civic virtue In short: FvD’s rhetoric involves a great deal of talk that one would nowadays not even get away with being drunk in a bar, but which for some reason has become acceptable in the political arena. Respect was once a moral and civic virtue. Now it is disrespectfulness with which many votes are won. Baudet masters the art of blatantly insulting people like few others. He has, to give just one example, celebrated his election victory by describing prime minister Rutte as a worthless piece of stupidity. As is so often the case with populists: the problem is not only what is being said, but also how it is being said. Baudet does not seem interested in reasoned arguments. He addresses gut-feelings and seeks to exploit them. No surprise While many reacted to FvD’s success with shock and astonishment, their success doesn’t come as a surprise. We have all been able to witness the growing popularity of the party that was founded in 2015, first as a think tank and alternative political movement. We have also been able to witness what the party stands for. Baudet is completely open about his views, as expressed in an endless chain of tweets and interviews. The success of FvD is founded on its use of social media. It is not a surge to power consolidated in the backrooms and corridors of politics. It all happens out in the open. ‘Democracy dies in darkness’, is the Wall Street Journal’s famous catchphrase. Yet there is reason to believe that in our era, democracy dies in broad day light too. On Twitter. On Facebook. On the streets. Many people no longer feel the need to hide their anti-democratic feelings and convictions. Prophets of doom I have never felt comfortable in the company of prophets of doom. We have heard it all too often over the past few years. The West is collapsing. Democracy is a thing of the past. A new world war is imminent. I don’t think we are witnessing an Untergang des Abendlandes. My faith in most people is stronger than my fear of some people. Liberal democracy can perish, but it won’t go down without a fight. We must not bury democracy before she has died. But we must begin to cure her, before she is dead. A remedy There is not a single remedy for our political system and society. But we must combat lies and alternative truths with reason. We must restore respect where there is now disdain. We must advocate a politics of compassion to counter the politics of resentment. We must listen to what people are saying, understand their worries and grievances, and offer a better and more humane solution than the one offered by those who want to recruit feelings without subjecting them to examination. Surely that is what democracy implies. Simply to dismiss popular feeling is to betray the democratic mission. But most of all: we must be clear about what is at stake. The most important struggle in politics today is not a struggle between left and right, rich and poor, so-called elites and the common people. It is a struggle between defenders of liberal democracy and its enemies. Given the historical relevance of the forthcoming European elections in May, it is important to bear this in mind. The future of Europe is not doomed, but it is at stake. By Alicja Gescinska Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Latest from Alicja Gescinska"

UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine A protection zone of 500 meters has been set up in Willemeau, Wallonia, after a pigeon was discovered to have the highly contagious Newcastle disease. While not dangerous to humans, Newcastle Disease is a highly contagious viral infection that affects many species of domestic and wild birds to varying degrees.As a result of the discovery, all poultry and pigeon holders in the area have been asked to return the duly completed animal inventory form with proof of valid vaccination, within seven days, at the Animal Welfare Department in Tournai.Newcastle disease does not occur in humans from eating poultry products. In very rare instances people working directly with sick birds can become infected. Symptoms are usually very mild, and limited to conjunctivitis and/or influenza-like symptoms.

Half of Flemish adopting parents do not finish the process,www.brusselstimes.com,,04-03-2019,2019,4,http://www.brusselstimes.com/belgium/14771/half-of-flemish-adoptive-parents-don-t-finish-the-process,"Half of Flemish adopting parents do not finish the process Tuesday, 02 April 2019 13:12 1 in 2 parents don't finish the adoption procedure. Edward Eyers/Pexels Almost half of the Flemish looking to adopt end up not going through with the adoption process. 48,8% of candidate-parents tend to drop out because the procedure is too cumbersome or keeps dragging on, according to Het Nieuwsblad . Sometimes, it even happens that there aren't enough candidate-parents and too many children.Ariane Van den Berghe, the Flemish adoption officer, put the percentages in perspective, explaining that candidate-parents are regularly found unfit, or quit midway through the procedure because they unexpectedly managed to get pregnant, for example. ""In some instances, it's true that there aren't enough parents, but those are very specific situations. Some kids have special needs, or they are already a little older.""The international exchange can be difficult as well. For children from some countries, the procedure is extra difficult and that takes more time. ""The conditions are sometimes really strict,"" clarified Van den Berghe. ""The parents-to-be have to be married for a specific amount of time, religion is important, procedures can be expensive."" It's not always so obvious.Now, the goal is to focus on these difficult situations to create more space for an accelerated intake procedure. ""Reduced waiting times will limit the number of candidate-parents dropping out.""In practice, the waiting time varies depending on the specific situation. For some candidates, the procedure goes very quickly, but for some countries, it can take up to 7 or 8 years. ""Those are the people I want to support, that way we can make sure these people don't quit part way through,"" said Van den Berghe. Maïthé Chini"

He picks out ten of his favourite hidden secrets in every issue for The Brussels Times Magazine. These are the picks in the latest April issue. PETITE RUE MALIBRAN The quiet Petite Rue Malibran is one of a handful of old lanes that have miraculously survived in Brussels. Originally named Rue des Pucelles, it’s the last remnant of a 15th-century country lane that once meandered through open fields. Barely changed since the 18th century, it remains an almost rural corner of Ixelles with whitewashed cottages covered in wisteria and a little park. Petite Rue Malibran, Ixelles LE TYPOGRAPHE The beautiful Ixelles printing shop Le Typographe now has a small branch in the centre of town. Located among the design stores on Rue des Chartreux, the shop is the perfect spot to stock up on stylish notebooks, pens, stamps and writing paper. But you still have to go to their Ixelles workshop to order personalised business cards or wedding invitations. Rue des Chartreux 14, Central Brussels www.typographe.be CAFE TULIPANT This stylish new café has taken over a corner building once occupied by the bar Le Coq. The interior still has traces of the past including an ancient tiled floor and faded green wallpaper. But it has been given a clean modern look with little round wood tables, mirrors and a massive stone bar. The friendly staff deliver cocktails, Belgian beers and decent bar food. They also organise DJ concerts, cocktail nights and other events. Place Fernand Cocq 25, Ixelles +32 (0)2 851 31 80, www.cafetulipant.be CHEZ PIAS Launched back in 1982, Pias (named after the famous quote “Play it again, Sam”) has evolved into Belgium’s biggest record company. The company has supported a long list of musicians including Nick Cave, Soulwax and Editors. You can drop into their small independent record store – located on the ground floor of a landmark Art Deco building – to get an idea of what the company is up to these days. They occasionally organise concerts and album releases in the basement space. St-Laurensstraat 36-38, Central Brussels +32 (0)2 558 58 11, www.pias.com CERTO This friendly little restaurant feels like you are eating in an Italian family kitchen. It’s quite a crush inside on a busy evening, but the mood is upbeat as staff squeeze between the tables and try not to trip over children. The menu is fairly basic, with four starters and four pasta dishes, but everything that comes out of the kitchen is fresh and interesting, while the wines are all organic. It all adds up to a perfect Italian experience. Rue Longue Vie 48, Ixelles +32 (0)473 49 64 93, www.certo.me KAFFABAR The first thing you’ll notice when you step inside this new coffee bar is the bulldog called Marcel. It’s a bit of a surprise, but most people seem happy enough to have him sniffing around their feet. Owner Marc quit a well-paid job in finance to set up this bohemian coffee bar on a square that is fast becoming cool. The coffee is made with beans from some of the best roasting firms in Europe. And there’s a terrace for sunny days. Place Rouppe 1, Central Brussels +32 (0)498 42 66 84, www.kaffabar.be RUE DES CHAMPS ELYSEES 6 The steep, hidden Rue des Champs-Elysées is named after a country tavern that formerly stood half way up the hill. The oldest buildings are Neoclassical, but you can also admire a few Art Nouveau houses. The strangest building is the house at No. 6 designed by Paul Hamesse in 1906 for the coal merchant Edouard Taymans. He invented a new type of stove which he displayed in the curious iron-and-glass showroom to the left. Victor Rousseau carved the stone sculpture above the entrance representing a family heating itself by a blazing fire. Rue des Champs Elysees 6, Ixelles FOOD TRUCK TRAIL As well as hosting the largest food truck festival in Europe, Brussels has developed a food truck route spread over 20 locations. A sign at each location lists the food truck schedule for the week. Popular spots include Square Frère Orban in the European Quarter, Porte de Namur and Place Jean Rey next to the Leopold Park. So now you know where to find your favourite coffee or gourmet burger. www.brussels.be/food-truck-parcours OLD BOY Named after a South Korean film, this relaxed Asian restaurant is a loving homage to Thai food. The interior is bright and modern, with an open kitchen and stools at the counter. The chef prepares delicious dishes including bao buns filled with chopped pork and “Angry Fish” (fried merlan with a spicy sichuan sauce). No booking so you may have to wait for a table. Rue Tenbosch 110, Ixelles +32 (0)2 544 15 55, www.oldboyrestaurant.be PLACE JO COX PLEIN It’s not easy to find this little square hidden behind the Ancienne Belgique concert hall. And it’s not especially interesting, apart from the blue street sign in two languages. It was named Place Jo Cox in 2018 in memory of a British member of parliament murdered by a far-right extremist a few days before the 2016 EU referendum. Jo Cox worked in Brussels for six years and was a big fan of AB. Off Rue de la Chaufferette, Central Brussels By Derek Blyth"

The photograph (credit: Leslye Stanbury) made me catch my breath when I saw it on Facebook.
These were obviously young people from Hastings & Rye – where I live; and where I was our parliamentary candidate for the last three General Elections.
It is easy to go along with the narrative in the left-leaning press outlets that I read: that our young people are instinctively progressive – anti-racist, environmentalist, socially liberal. And yet, clearly – as the photo proves – this isn’t so all across the country.
On some level it makes sense that there would be some Hastings young folk at the pro-Brexit demonstration. The constituency voted pretty clearly to Leave (55% to 45%) back in 2016.
And yet I found it genuinely sad and disappointing that we have obviously failed these young people in particular – failed to persuade them that membership of the European Union has serious benefits for them, and for their future.
This only goes to cement my view that, should we end up having elections to the European Parliament later this next month, or even the month after, we need to elect a cohort of Liberal Democrat Members of the European Parliament who are committed to holding routine surgeries in schools and colleges the length and breadth of the country. MEPs who are committed to working in partnership with teachers; and to spend time listening to the views of our young people, on how they see our country; and how they imagine their own future.
I believe there is an opportunity, with the help of simple surveys, to start to get a more scientific understanding of the political priorities of our school-age citizens. And this is not only interesting for the media and wider country; but it is useful to us as a party: to help us to understand how better to engage with a generation of young people who may be our allies and supporters of the future.
There has been a good deal said in the national media that the Remain campaign failed in 2016 largely because Project Fear was rejected. There should, instead, have been a passionate, emotional, gut-grabbing case for the benefits of EU membership.
How we have secured peace, prosperity, freedoms; how we have worked together to progress action on climate change, robust corporate taxation; how we have harmonised phone tariffs and late aeroplane reimbursements; how we have made progress on food labelling, ethics and standards. How we have secured greater prosperity and assisted small and larger businesses with the removal of non-tariff barriers. All these things that are the important stuff of the daily lives of British families.
Now, with Parliament in chaos – in this uncharted political territory – in this limbo, when we do not know how long the UK will remain a full, top-table member of the European Union – it is the time for our party to work with our Liberal Democrat parliamentarian in the European Parliament (and any new team of MEPs, if elections do go ahead) to double-down; to do this work with our young people.
And then to shout about it.

An extraordinary cabinet meeting today. Robert Peston called it possibly the most important cabinet meeting in 50 years. All ministers’ phones were confiscated and ministers were locked in a cupboard “until the PM had decided what they decided”, (using Peston’s words).
The PM says she is taking action to break the log jam by sitting down with Corbyn to agree a plan. …Either to agree an option to put to MPs or, if none can be agreed, agree a series of options to put to MPs, with the winner (which there probably won’t be) being implemented by the government.
More can kicking? More looking for a scapegoat?
The one thing which appears solid is that May has abandoned any idea of a fourth vote on her deal.
Interestingly, this is actually the second time in this process that May said she would work with the opposition. Not much came of the last attempt. That was around March 23rd when David Liddington sat down with some opposition figures.

"Bryce Harper Returns to Washington, Nats Fans Suffer Meltdown",www.newsweek.com,Dan Cancian,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsweek.com/bryce-harper-boos-philadelphia-phillies-washington-nationals-1384332,"Bryce Harper’s return to Washington was nothing short of eventful. On Tuesday night, the former Nationals star made his first appearance in the capital since leaving Washington to sign a $330-million deal with the Philadelphia Phillies in February.
Before the game, Harper thanked the city of Washington and Nationals fans with a post on his Instagram profile, but that did not spare him a reception that was from welcoming.
Harper was booed loudly as he stepped up against Max Scherzer, as Nationals fans made their feelings known loud and clear. The applause that accompanied him onto the field seemed to come almost exclusively from the sections packed with Phillies fans.
The hostile atmosphere wasn’t limited to boos either, with Nationals fans holding up signs depicting Harper as a traitor, while others enquired whether he had already morphed into a Philadelphia Flyers fan.
In a further, subtle dig at their former star, the fans holding up the Flyers sign were dressed as clowns. The choice of attire seemed to reference Harper’s response to an interviewer who in 2012 had asked him whether he planned to have a few beers.
Harper, who is a Mormon and was 19 at the time, replied with: “That’s a clown question, bro.”
Others, meanwhile, held up a picture of Harper portrayed as Benedict Arnold, following the example set by D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser. On Monday, Bowser tweeted the picture of the right fielder as Arnold, who famously betrayed the Continental Army during the Revolutionary War in 1780, defecting to Great Britain.
The post was hastily deleted but not quickly enough to prevent some Nationals fan from printing out the picture and using it to welcome Harper on Tuesday.
One supporter took a more radical approach, changing Harper’s name on his Nationals jersey to something a little less glamorous.
The boos only got louder after Harper struck out on a 2-2 changeup in his first appearance on the field. The 26-year-old then struck out again in the top of the third inning, but eventually he had the last laugh.
He hit a double to right field in the top of the fifth, then an RBI single in the top of the sixth, which was greeted by “MVP” chants from the Phillies fans.
To cap it all off, Harper signed off with a huge two-run homer in the eighth inning.
""I feel like it's a little different coming back here and getting booed,"" he told ESPN.
""I go out there and try to play my game and understand I have teammates in that dugout that are going to pull for me every single day.
""I have the city of Philadelphia behind me each and every night. If I have that, then nothing else matters to me.""
The Phillies ran out 8-2 winners to maintain their perfect record so far this season, while the Nationals slipped to 1-3.

General Electric (NYSE:GE) was upgraded by Zacks Investment Research from a “sell” rating to a “hold” rating in a research note issued to investors on Monday, Zacks.com reports.
According to Zacks, “Over the past three months, General Electric's shares have outperformed its industry. The company is poised to become more competent on the back of the portfolio-restructuring program. In sync with this, it intends to focus on three core businesses — Power, Aviation and Renewable Energy — and gradually exit all others. Moreover, the company has slashed the dividend from 12 cents per share to a penny (helping it retain significant cash annually) and planned to reorganize the Power business into two separate units. Notably, in the quarters ahead, a weakening Power business remains a key cause of concern for the company. General Electric expects internal and external challenges to continue hurting this business arm. Moreover, headwinds like currency translation might be detrimental to its profits.” Get General Electric alerts:

"Studios, movie theater owners and stars convene at CinemaCon",www.dailypolitical.com,Jeff Wilder,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailypolitical.com/2019/04/03/studios-movie-theater-owners-and-stars-convene-at-cinemacon.html,"Westminster Group (WSG) Reaches New 1-Year Low at $8.00 Studios, movie theater owners and stars convene at CinemaCon April 3rd, 2019 - Comments Off on Studios, movie theater owners and stars convene at CinemaCon - Filed Under - by Jeff Wilder Tweet
The film industry — everyone in the Hollywood studios who produce the movies to the companies that make seats, speakers and the displays in theatres — have been descending on Las Vegas this week . As the yearly trade show kicks off Monday in Caesar’s Palace, the future of movie going will be in the spotlight.
There will certainly be much celebration and self-congratulation for the record 2018 box office year, which exceeded $11.8 billion in ticket sales in North America, and recent successes like”Us” and”Captain Marvel.” Yet this year’s CinemaCon is coming in a time of great change in Hollywood. Streaming and how long movies play in theaters have been a conversation staple at CinemaCon in the past several decades, but Walt Disney Co.’s just-completed purchase of 20th Century Fox will be the elephant in the room. Get alerts:
“People are actually questioning what this consolidation is going to look like for the entire business,” explained Kevin Grayson, the president of domestic distribution for STX Films. On a practical level, it means that there will not be a separate presentation from Fox, which staged an elaborate creation, usually involving its former supply chief.
“We will absolutely miss the Fox existence, but we also need to encourage and embrace Disney for that which they deliver into our business and what they’re going to look to do to further bolster the supply line of terrific item,” explained Mitch Neuhauser, the managing director of CinemaCon. “It is definitely going to be a very bittersweet tradition. But we’ll change with the times and also proceed in a productive way.”
Disney, that has been the market-leader for 3 years running, together with three of the other significant studios, including Universal, Warner Bros. and Paramount (Sony will be sitting this year out), will likely come equipped with splashy fresh footage, including trailers and some of their main stars to reevaluate their slates for the summer movie season and outside to an audience of theatre owners, from the greatest chains to the smallest mom and pop stores.
It’s not just the biggest studios: Lionsgate, Amazon, Neon and STX Entertainment will also be present, with some showing sneak peeks of upcoming movies like”Wild Rose,””Late Night” and”Long Shot.”
STX will kick off the principal studio presentations after a few opinions on the state of the industry.
“It actually gives us that chance to shine a light on STX and reveal we are not here for the brief term, we’re here for the long term,” said STX’s Grayson.
STX specializes in mid-range and mid-budgeted industrial movies like”The Upside” and”Second Act,” and CinemaCon is still also a vital space to socialize with not just the big players in exhibit but the individuals who have”twins and triples” in the middle of the nation that are just as essential to their enterprise.
“We’re releasing 10 to 12 movies this year and 12 to 15 second year,”Grayson said. “So when the other studios are creating the tentpoles, it allows us to fill this gap.”
Outside the primary theater, there’ll also be a world on the trade exhibition floor demonstrating best and the most up-to-date in all to concession snacks from theatre technologies.
“There’s been a nonstop momentum of new technology that’s driving the industry,” said Neuhauser.
Ray Nutt, Fathom Occasions, that specializes from classic movies to the Metropolitan Opera as well as sporting events’ CEO, agrees.
“that box office listing does not only happen because there’s good content on the market,” Nutt said. “It occurs because the comforts in the theaters are amazing nowadays, while it’s luxury seats or enhanced food and drink. All of these are things which make visiting the movie theater particular and one of a kind.”
Julien Marcel, the CEO of Webedia Movies Guru, a technology and data firm for the modeling industry, predicts that there’ll likewise be much debate within the”second digital revolution” in film going.
“All film experiences begin on the internet and the essential obstacle for exhibitors is how to adapt with this 2nd electronic revolution,” Marcel said. “The first digital revolution was when projection moved from analog to digital. Now we are at the heart of the second digital revolution where the marketing goes digital and the ticket sales go all digital.”
Marcel’s company recently released a study that said that there was 18.7 percent increase in online ticket revenue in 2018. Film tickets bought online currently make up around a quarter of all ticket revenue.
In addition, he expects there to be a whole great deal of focus on the”subscription economy.” MoviePass may be struggling, but AMC and Cinemark have found successes using their models and more businesses are gearing up to do the same.
And with all the changes as ever going into CinemaCon the disposition is optimism.
“I’ve been around this business for 30 decades now and it was something which was coming whether it was cable tv or the VCR which was going to kill the market,” said Nutt. “But people in this business keep innovating in various approaches to keep folks coming back from the theater to have this communal experience. It’s pretty gratifying to find that the resiliency of this industry.”
