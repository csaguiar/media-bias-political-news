How to Read a Large Amount of Information and Fight against Fake News – The Red (Team) Analysis Society,www.redanalysis.org,View More Posts,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.redanalysis.org/2019/04/03/read-large-amount-information/,"Leave a comment on How to Read a Large Amount of Information and Fight against Fake News
The incredible and growing amount of information available nowadays presents us with specific challenges we need to overcome.
Meanwhile, the rediscovery of propaganda and the power of rumours spread on social networks, now labelled “fake news”, only make more acute the need to find our way through the mass of information available.
This is even more important if, as students, professionals or citizens, our aim is to be able to understand, foresee, warn about, and finally adequately answer accumulating dangers, threats, risks or more broadly changes and uncertainties.
Our information age is characterised by what Martin Hilbert called the “ global information explosion ” (“Digital Technology & Social Change” University of California Course, 2015), when we constantly face “information overload” (among many others, Bertram Gross, The Managing of Organizations , 1964; Alvin Toffler, Future Shock , 1970; also Stanley Milgram, “ The experience of living in cities “, Science , 167, 1461-1468, 1970). Browse our most popular articles
Google estimated in 2010 that 129,864,880 books had then been published (Leonid Taycher, “ Books of the world, stand up and be counted! All 129,864,880 of you. ” 5 Aug 2010). Wikipedia estimates that “approximately 2,200,000” books were published each year across the world. Meanwhile, it is almost frightening to look live at the constantly growing number of internet website: 1 , 080 , 387 ,230+ on 15 Sept 2016; 1,675,967,895 on 28 March 2019; i.e. an augmentation of more than 595 million website, or 55% in a bit more than two years and six months( internet live stats ).
Those are general figures, but they are also representative of what we must face when we work on a specific topic, because we have to deal with all the relevant knowledge and understanding accumulated. Browse all our featured articles
To this we must, most of the time, add current unfolding events and facts. For example, if one wants to start working on an issue related to Libya, a simple google search on the word Libya returns 224,000,000 results in September 2016 and 299,000,000 in March 2019. A larger theme, such as energy, returned 1,340,000,000 results in September 2016 and 2,900,000,000 in March 2019.
Let us take another example with already filtered information, such as the bibliography of a PhD thesis. Even though information has been sorted out, we could get a 14 pages list of scholarly books and articles (approximately 336 texts) or more, and 49 pages of references to archival material. In that case, archival references may correspond to 4 to 5 large storage boxes of documents and 12 CD-Rom of digitalized text documents (example taken from my PhD ).
Another example of pre-sorted information is a “simple” reading list for one topic for a Master or PhD course. Such reading lists used to cover at least ten pages (e.g. Princeton, International Relations 2007, approx. 200 books and articles).
In all cases, this is a lot to read, most often in an always too short amount of time. And we are only focusing here on written media, when time must now also be made for other media such as videos, audio media, and social network exchanges.
How can we thus face this challenge?
In the meantime, how can we make sure we do not fall prey to “fake news”? To the “fake news” problem, I would also add how can we avoid losing time reading low quality pieces? The use of other media, besides written texts, complicates the problem and present also technical challenges. They are outside the scope of this article.
At the heart of these two issues we have a major question. How can we read efficiently and usefully for our purpose, and more generally for analysis and understanding of political, geopolitical, and international relations’ issues*?
The remaining part of the article will provide practical advice to learn to read efficiently and usefully, while avoiding as much as possible, to fall prey to “fake news”.
We shall first stress that the aim is understanding and that accumulation of knowledge is only a means to this end. Second, we shall focus on purposeful reading of classically written academic and scientific texts (including articles, books, reports, monographs etc.), and see why and how their structure are both crucial and helpful, stressing very practical ways to read. We shall then turn to other types of written texts, namely newspaper articles and primary materials (speeches, official documents, etc.) and finally stress a hard way to sort through useful or not documents.** The aim is quality understanding not accumulation of quantity of knowledge
In our field – and in many related others – the first and absolutely crucial idea to keep in mind is that, initially, what we seek to achieve is NOT to accumulate a large quantity of knowledge, but to develop a proper understanding of a topic, question or issue, however loosely defined it may be before you start reading anything. Subscribe for new articles
Knowledge is, of course, fundamental, but it is a means to an end. Knowledge will thus be a building block for the construction of your understanding.
Keeping this idea in mind will help you overcoming – at least partly – anxiety about what you do not know. What must matter to you is to know enough to develop a good understanding of the topic you are studying, as well as, in the case of anticipation, to allow you thinking out of the box.
We are not trying to hoard knowledge, nor do we aim at showing off how knowledgable we are. We read to understand at best something (and hopefully, also, meanwhile, we enjoy it). Become a member
Even if you were working in tactical intelligence to prevent terrorist attacks, for example, where at one stage you would need to know, ideally, everything to make sure not to miss an attack that is being prepared, before to reach this step – which fundamentally belongs to the monitoring and surveillance phases (see Helene Lavoix, “ Horizon Scanning and Monitoring For Anticipation: Definition and Practice “, RTAS , 4 March 2019) – you would first need to develop an understanding of the terrorists’ strategies, their beliefs, their motivations, previous modes of operations, etc.
It is this initial fundamental phase related to understanding that is our primary concern here.
Moreover, even during the monitoring and surveillance phase, you would also need to focus your reading on these useful pieces of information relevant to your task, i.e. preventing a terrorist attack.
Thus, even in that case, quality understanding of information primes over blind quantity accumulation. Meanwhile, reading still matters. Reading classically scholarly written documents
This may come as a surprise to you, but, to read usefully and efficiently, we only relatively rarely read documents, be it books, reports, articles, memos or even short briefs, from A to Z.
Most of the time, the pleasure of reading all the words of a written document is only reserved for leisure and novels, poetry, etc. In a work environment, reading every word is impossible – and potentially not very useful either. This may not be very nice for the author, who has spent months and sometimes years researching and writing, but this is the way it is, and the only way forward considering the breadth of accumulated knowledge. And, do not worry, most authors also do the same; they skim through texts for their own purpose.
However, purposeful reading is only possible because we can rely on a normative typical structure for scholarly written work, which reflects millennia of scholarly work and grounds the quality of written documents. It is this classical structure or more exactly what we assume is implied by that classical structure and contained within it that allows speeding reading. What I mean here by “speeding reading” is that we take in the gist of a book or article, or we focus on very specific points contained in the text, which may be of particular interest to the specific issue or problem we try to understand.
Should this structure not be respected, or not entail what we assume is behind it, purposeful reading and speeding reading would become much more difficult, or slower, if not impossible.
As a result, we shall read texts with different origins and structures in a different way, as we shall see very practically below. What is this typical classical scholarly structure?
Classically, all academic and scientific literature, be it books or articles should be more or less constructed following the same outline (among many others, University of Canterbury, “ Academic Essays: form and function “; Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association, Sixth Edition ): an abstract, i.e. what this article or book is about, which is often a very brief summary of the introduction and conclusion; an introduction, itself composed of a hook, i.e. what makes the document relevant and thus interesting for the reader; a definition of the terms of the question or issue, which is addressed in the rest of the document. In the case of scientific books, this is where you will find, typically a literature review of the state of knowledge on the research problem, furthermore often highlighting existing debates. It leads to: the specific question or issue or research problem that will be addressed (what is called in French the “ problématique “) with its scope. In the case of books you will also find here the methodology and the type of material (interviews, archives, news articles, speeches, etc. ) that will be used; a presentation of the outline of the document; the body of the document presented according to the outline; the conclusion, which fundamentally answers the introduction. It usually includes: a reminder of the research problem, issue or question; a brief summary of the findings as developed in the body of the document; an opening on further research, new ideas that follow from the findings, etc. a bibliography, which is a list of all the documents used in the text.
Furthermore, all the text is accompanied by footnotes, which are nothing else than references to the various types of evidence used and ideas developed previously by scientists and authors (e.g. standardisation according to APA Style ).
It is vital to understand that footnotes or similar references are a crucial building block of our world . They underlay the whole system of copyrights for example, scientific progress, as well as the difference between facts and objective analysis (presence of footnotes or similar types of references) on the one hand, hearsay, propaganda and opinion (absence of footnotes or similar type of references), on the other. This is thanks to footnotes and references that you will get a key weapon to fight against fake news. Using classical text structure to read purposefully
Now you know this structure, you most probably already envision how it can help purposefully with speeding your reading and your understanding.
Follow the next steps… unashamedly: Read the abstract. If this is interesting and relevant for your purpose, continue, if not discard, and move to the next document. Read the introduction. Abandon if you find out it is not relevant to your current purpose. Read the conclusion. According to your own purpose, read chapters, pages or even paragraphs that are relevant but only those . These can – and must – be read in detail. It may here be useful – or helpful – to take notes, and jot down the thoughts that reading generate in you, if this can enhance your understanding. This is even truer for the texts that are the most difficult to understand, because we are not used anymore to such complexity of thinking. I am thinking here about, for example, some past philosophers, whose works remain crucial. For very specific research – for example references to a specific fighting group in Syria, or Libya or elsewhere, or to a faction, or to an event, etc. – use the index of the book if available. Thanks to electronic format, do not hesitate to use the search engine. You have a search function for PDF, word-processor documents and also in browsers. Enter your keyword, and the places in your text where your keyword is mentioned will be emphasised. You thus know which paragraphs you need to read. This may sometimes lead you to read a bit more to be able to understand what the author meant – always be careful never to misinterpret what is written – but you will have spared the time to skim through the book or article, which you would have needed to do without a search function.
That’s it, you have extracted from the article, or book (or report, monograph etc.) all you need to know for your specific current work.
Don’t worry, you will remember actually much more than what you think, and, if ever, for another purpose you were to need this book or article again, your memory will send you a warning message suggesting you go back to this book.
This somehow unconscious memory is one of the reasons why reading is – so far – superior to entrusting this function to an artificial intelligence. If you are not the one reading, then this “unconscious memory” cannot function. You may think you spare time, but, on the long run, you lose time by depriving you of fundamental information.
Finally, be flexible with the principles explained above. Always use your good sense, remain practical, and also follow your instinct. Sometimes, it is crucial to read a bit more or more in-depth, as this is in this unexpected area that a solution to one nagging problem will be found.
As explained, earlier, it is important to emphasise again that it is because we are certain that, if needed, we can go to the body of the book or article, where the research and the arguments are explained that we can fully trustfully skip them. We know that if needed we can go there and find the details necessary, as well as the right evidence.
It is, also, of course, because we trust science and the related architecture of understanding that we can skip the research and arguments. Indeed, we assume that the research and the demonstrations are correct. As a result, if the standard of research and of scientific reasoning and thinking were to be lowered, then we would not be able to skip the argument, even if, formally nothing has changed.
If ever the scientific thinking and architecture of understanding were shaken, then confusion would ensue. As a result, the spread of fake news would be favoured, while reading would immediately be slowed, as everything would have to be checked.
Unfortunately, the ego of untrained individual, who think they know best and spread absurdity is a perfect way to start destroying scientific thinking outside scientific circles. Unfortunately, this is increasingly widespread nowadays. A whole article would deserve to be written on this very topic.
Let us, despite these worrying trends, consider we remain in the case where the scientific understanding and structure are standing. Once you have read your first text as explained above, you can now move to the next document. Using at best the literature review available in an introduction
The state of the art or literature review in an introduction, when it is well done, is an incredible tool to read efficiently, usefully and quickly. Thus, use it as such.
Whatever the topic, issue or problem upon which you are working and that you are trying to understand, try first to find a (good) book addressing the same issue. Then, read with attention the literature review. The latter will give you all the authors, books and articles dealing with your topic and that must be read. Even more interesting, it will provide a first summary of these other documents’ content, and explain where they are wanting. This first summary will allow you to decide if you must add this or that text to what you need to read to understand. At worst, you will still be able to incorporate in your understanding the summary or specific points the literature review will have underlined.
As a trick, the best documents to find proper literature reviews are PhDs and classically written good scientific/academic books. Master theses may also be of great interest because many of them are actually a literature review. Using bibliographies and footnotes
Any serious article, post, book, report, monograph, etc. uses footnotes and/or bibliographies, as underlined previously. In the case of web-publication, what you must look for are proper references, most of the time with hyperlinks.
Those will be gold mines for you as they will, in a way similar to the literature review, point you in the direction of the next works you must read. Newspaper articles (facts and evidence)
Mainly use newspaper articles for facts and evidence, making sure they are properly sourced.
Newspaper articles are also useful to help you identifying which primary material, such as a speech by an official or member of government (see below), you MUST read. In this latter case, you cannot be satisfied, most of the time, only by what the journalist chose to report. Indeed, most newspapers have a specific editorial line and are partisan. Hence, you must read the original text and if the newspaper refers to a news conference, then, if possible, find transcripts of these.
Most of the time, the title of the article is enough to let you know if you need to skim through the news article, read it in detail, or just move to another one.
In some instances – unfortunately increasingly rarer – when a newspaper article includes in-depth interview(s), then read the whole article. Currently many newspaper articles relay only opinions – which is different from analyses – and, save in cases when they are contextualised and characterised properly, opinions are of no interest to us. Of course, if our purpose is to work with beliefs and ways to understand the world, then opinions become very important, because they are our primary material (analyses also may in that case be handled in a similar way). Nonetheless, opinions are not analyses and must be handled as opinions, not as analyses. Primary sources: speeches, reports, official documents, interviews, etc. Reading material from primary sources Screenshot of the timetable for available Daily Press Briefings of the U.S. Department of State on the web.
When you deal with primary material – material which originates directly from an actor that is relevant to your topic, e.g. a President, a spokesman, a member of the armed forces, a ministry or service within an agency, a company, groups and movements, people (in a representative way according to your topic) etc. – then, most of the time, you must Skim through it, to make sure it is relevant to your focus: for example, if you are working on energy, then a statement by the President of the U.S. or of Russia on, say, education policies for children below six years old, is most probably irrelevant. When you skim through documents though, be careful not to miss second and third order related topics. For those materials that are relevant – or for the part of the document that is relevant – read each and every single work of it, as nuances and specific words used matter. Evaluating the reliability of the source and of the information
In general, primary information must always be evaluated for its reliability. The best way is to use what was created by the intelligence services. An information is evaluated according to the source (who gave the information in the first place) and to the piece of information itself (e.g. Department of the U.S., Army, Headquarters, “Appendix B, Source and Information Reliability Matrix”, Field Manual No. 2-22.3 (34-52) , 2006 – download Appendix-B ).
If we take the example of tweets, for example, which are sometimes our only source of information on some unfolding events – this was, for instance, very often the case for Libya – then you should contrast people who only state things, from those who make the effort to give evidence that will back their statements by any means, including photos, and videos. Once you have evaluated that a person on twitter is serious, then, even though s/he may sometimes post statements without evidences, you can attribute a higher quality to the information because of the reliability of the source you estimated.
However, especially with the spread of artificial intelligence means, remain extra careful.
Knowing how to evaluate the reliability of information is absolutely crucial to fight against fake news. Practicing systematically the evaluation of the reliability is, of course, even more important.
If this may appear as cumbersome initially, you will get used to do it and thus benefit from the learning curve.
Actually considering the lowering overall standard of publication, and the rising confusion (read among others the excellent article Max Read, “ How Much of the Internet Is Fake? Turns Out, a Lot of It, Actually .” Intelligencer , 26 Dec 2018), it is a very good idea to apply your evaluation to all information, including to what should be good analysis, not only to primary sources anymore. This is very unfortunate and painful to write, but … better be safe than sorry. Sorting through documents the hard way
The classical structure of a scientific and academic text and its significance, as well as the importance to evaluate the reliability of information, allows you to sort through the mass of documents you should read to understand an issue.
It also allows you to discard those that are of sub-optimal quality.
If a text does not contain references, i.e. no footnotes in the case of a paper document, eventually no proper sources in case the author is not acquainted with the footnote system, and/or no properly referenced hyperlinks in the case of a text published on the world-wide-web, then it becomes a collection of opinions, and hearsay. At worst, these types of texts are one of the places where you will find the crudest fake news.
Such a text has no value and you can just discard it, i.e. not read it.
Of course, this does not concern reasoning and demonstrations, which belong fully to the author and which are of value. However, it is very rare in matters of national and international security that a whole text will be about reasoning and demonstrations, which belong only to the author. Most of the time, references and facts are needed, which must thus be properly referenced, or the author will refer to others’ reasoning and demonstrations, which similarly must be referenced.
Even if it is unfortunately a growing trend on the web not to use references and sourcing – even from well-known think tanks, do not lose your time reading these articles. Because we do not know who said what, and where the author found this or that idea or fact, we just cannot consider the text as more than mere hearsay and opinion (to say nothing of plagiarism). Nothing can be checked, the assumed quality and reliability we mentioned earlier are not there, thus it is better using your precious time to read something else.
When only facts are concerned, similarly, if a text does not use sources, then it means that you cannot check the origin of the idea or fact. This means that the reliability of the information delivered is possibly dubious, and in any case that we shall never know. Thus again, do not lose your time with this text, even though it comes from a prestigious publisher (think tank, risk management company, famous person, high level official, etc.).
The only way to consider such texts would then be as primary material, but you must then apply to it the rules explained above about the quality of information.
If you apply all these ways to read, and if you use your good sense and your logic – including sometimes to go against the principles explained here, as there are always exceptions – then you will not only have greatly reduced the amount to read, but also improved the way you read. Meanwhile you will have contributed to fight against fake news and sub-optimal content.
Furthermore, by accepting it is impossible to read every word ever written on a topic, by abandoning any dream of omniscience, you will not only lower your anxiety, which will enhance all your cognitive processes, but also develop a kind of “confident humility”, which then will be an incredible asset in mitigating biases and thus in improving the quality of your analyses (see Geopolitical Risk and Crisis Anticipation online course 1, module 3 ).
You are now ready to read efficiently and usefully any document.
Reducing further the number of documents to read, which we have started to see here briefly, is also absolutely crucial, but belongs to analytical methodology (e.g. see Geopolitical Risk and Crisis Anticipation online course 1 ). As you now master useful reading, you are fully ready for this next step.
Notes
* We shall not address here technologically-based supports (besides simple searches), which are in themselves an entire topic and most of the time, anyway, demand some amount of reading to be properly implemented. Furthermore analysts want, like and need to keep a mastery of their subject matter, thus knowing how to read remains a crucial skill.
**The skills transmitted in this article were first taught to me by my lecturers at university and then resulted from more than twenty years of practice in research as well as analysis.

"With Turkish loss of the F-35, Israel keeps its aerial superiority",warsclerotic.com,josephwouk,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://warsclerotic.com/2019/04/03/with-turkish-loss-of-the-f-35-israel-keeps-its-aerial-superiority/,"BY ANNA AHRONHEIM APRIL 3, 2019 17:15 A U.S.Marine Corps F-35B joint strike fighter jet conducts aerial maneuvers during aerial refueling training over the Atlantic Ocean in this undated picture released August 20, 2015. (photo credit: REUTERS/US MARINE CORPS/HANDOUT)
The Pentagon’s decision to stop the delivery of equipment related to the F-35 stealth fighter jet to Turkey due to Ankara’s decision to purchase the Russian-made S-400 air defense system will allow Israel to keep it’s aerial superiority in the Middle East.
Washington’s move follows repeated warnings both from the United States and NATO allies to Ankara that buying the Russian system alongside the Lockheed Martin-produced jets would threaten the security of the F-35s by learning how to spot and track it. Israel, which also has fragile relations with Turkey, currently has 14 F-35 Adir jets and is expected to receive a total of 50 planes to make two full squadrons by 2024.
According to foreign reports, Israel has already quietly tested ways to defeat the advanced Russian air defense system, participating in several joint drills with the Greek Air Force over the island of Crete where one system is stationed. The drills have reportedly allowed Israeli warplanes to gather data on how the advanced system may be blinded or fooled.
But there are fears that the radar on the S-400 systems bought by Turkey, which has entered into a sort of alliance with Russia and has been in close cooperation with Iran, could learn the weak spots in the jet and make it less able to evade Russian weapons in the future.
The top uniformed officer in NATO and the head of American forces in Europe, General Curtis Scaparrotti warned in March during testimony to the Senate Armed Services Committee that Ankara’s purchase of the S-400 presents a problem for not only the F-35 but to all American aircraft.
“My best military advice would be that we don’t then follow through with the F-35: flying it or working with an ally that is working with Russian systems, particularly air defense systems, with one of our most advanced technological capabilities,” Scaparrotti was quoted by Defense News as saying.
Built by Lockheed Martin, the jets have an extremely low radar signature allowing them to operate undetected deep inside enemy territory as well as to evade advanced missile defense systems like the S-300 and S-400.
The already fragile relations between Israel and Turkey have been increasingly strained in recent months as Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, a vocal critic of Israel’s policy toward the Palestinians, has intensified his rhetoric.
Israeli officials have voiced concern over Turkey’s purchasing of the jets, with one senior defense official quoted by Haaretz in August as saying that Israel would like to be the only country in the Middle East with the F-35 in order to keep its qualitative military edge and out of fears that the jet’s capabilities would be leaked to enemy countries.
Ceng Sagnic from the Moshe Dayan Center in Tel Aviv told The Jerusalem Post that while Moscow might be “hesitant” to share the knowledge of the jet which might be gained by its S-400, it couldn’t be ruled out.
“Moscow would definitely be hesitant to share the military “secrets” it has obtained with a third party. But in the event of a major dispute in the region or a potentially expanded Moscow-Tehran alliance, transfer of knowledge on US weapon systems to Tehran can well be a topic of discussion,” he said.
According to Sagnic, it is impossible to estimate the extent of Ankara’s “cloudy relations” with Moscow.
“The presence of both F-35s and S-400s can also come with a similar outcome itself. If Turkey had purchased F-35s from the US and S-400s from Russia, the situation would partially resemble Greece – where the coincidental presence of S-300 systems allowed, according to foreign reports, NATO and Israel to carefully study these weapons,” he said, adding that “in the case of Turkey, although it would stay a member of NATO, the future extent of its relations with Russia cannot be estimated and Ankara could well remain pressured by Moscow to allow such studies. Given that Turkey is and will be a country of crises – and therefore is mostly prone to Russian pressure – the possibility increases even further.”
Israel became the first air force outside the United States to declare Initial Operational Capability (IOC) of the jet in 2017. Last year, IAF chief Maj.-Gen. Amikam Norkin announced that Israel has struck targets in the Middle East with the F-35 Adir jet twice, making the Jewish state the first country to use the stealth fighter in a combat role in the region.
According to Sagnic, “Turkey must be seriously thinking that Israel may be behind the cancellation of the F-35 deal in order to preserve its air superiority. However, for the domestic politics, Ankara needs a “usual suspect” to blame, as blaming the US cannot be enough to explain the disruption in one the biggest weapons agreement Turkey has signed.”
As a Level-3 partner in the multinational F-35 program, Turkey invested over $1 billion on the jet, with several local companies producing components for the aircraft including fuselages and cockpit screens such as Alp Aviation, AYESAS, Kale Aviation, Kale Pratt & Whitney and Turkish Aerospace Industries.
Turkish defense companies also produce high-end SOM-J missiles for the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) program and Turkey is Europe’s maintenance and repair center for F-35 fighter aircraft manufactured under the JSF plan.
Ankara took delivery of its first F-35 in June at a ceremony in Texas and the country plans to purchase 100 stealth jets in the coming years. Turkish pilots have already been learning to fly the jet training alongside U.S. pilots at Luke Air Force Base, Arizona. Ankara is holding onto hope that the two more jets expected to be handed over this month will actually be delivered."

GOP Strategist and Massive Anti-Trumper Rick Wilson ... Teaching Florida Democrats How to Win?,www.sunshinestatenews.com,Nancy Smith,04-03-2019,2019,4,http://www.sunshinestatenews.com/story/gop-strategist-and-massive-anti-trumper-rick-wilson-teaching-florida-democrats-how-win,"GOP Strategist and Massive Anti-Trumper Rick Wilson ... Teaching Florida Democrats How to Win? By April 3, 2019 - 7:00am Rick Wilson
The ascendancy of Donald Trump in the GOP primary in 2016 caused a rift in the Republican Party. That fracture became a canyon with his ensuing election win, and a vocal Never-Trump faction growing increasingly louder over the past couple of years. GOP strategist Rick Wilson of Florida has been a member of that separatist contingent, if not its leader.
Recently, Wilson has grown increasingly more antagonistic ... until now it appears he has moved further, going past mere Trump opposition to actually looking to aid the Democrats in Florida. A fairly wild notion for a long-entrenched Republican loyalist.
The political landscape of the state and how it would be impacted by the growing contingent of Puerto Rican transplants has been the focus of speculation for years. While Hurricane Maria caused a great many of the island residents to transplant to Florida in the fall of 2017, what actually took place was a slight acceleration of a long-term exodus. With the economic conditions on the island in a never-ending downward spiral, Florida has been absorbing Boricua pilgrims for more than a decade.
Today more Puerto Ricans live on the U.S. mainland than on the island itself, and the Florida PR population has exceeded one million for some time. Political pundits in the Sunshine State have long expected to see the party power tilt toward Democrats as a result of this ongoing influx. The reason for this was based more on assumptive reasoning than analysis of those who were making the trek to the States.
Wilson has made it clear he opposes President Trump in pretty much every manner one man can possibly oppose him. A regular guest on antagonistic news networks CNN and MSNBC, he also is the author of the stinging book, “Anything Trump Touches Dies,” an immediate resident on the New York Times Bestseller List in 2018. Now he's making the move even further afield of the GOP establishment. In a debate currently waged in D.C., Congress is working on a hurricane relief bill and there have been contretemps between the parties over the amount of additional funding that will go to Puerto Rico.
After an effective verbal agreement on the spending had been reached, Trump hurled in a monkey wrench in the proceeding. The president has called to curtail the spending for the island. Democrats want to keep the amount in place for the continued relief efforts. In a late-night flurry on Twitter, President Trump gave his numerous reasons for clipping the payouts.
This led Rick Wilson to return volley with his own series of tweets.
However, more than opposing the president’s relief policy, what Wilson delivered was a kind of strategy plan for the Democratic Party in Florida. While he sounds as if he castigated the party for its ongoing inability to be effective, what Wilson is doing in reality is showing the Florida Dems what they've been doing wrong. It is a curious stance, seeing a GOP party planner describing for Democrats a plan on what they need to do to earn those Puerto Rican votes. Donald Trump
Click on the links to the tweets and see for yourself. If that's too much clicking, here's Wilson's whole series of tweets, one after the other, laid out like tarot cards in a carnival sideshow:
TWEET NO. 1 : ""Just a reminder of the why Democrats are holistically terrible at politics. Trump is HANDING you Puerto Rican voters in Florida. On a platter. It's a layup. But the Democrats will do just what they did in 2016: jack. Followed by squat.""
TWEET NO. 2 : ""It'll be another ""we got this"" Potemkin Village. They'll farm it out to some contractor or group who won't go out, pull the voter file to ID PR registered voters, track down new arrivals from the island to register them, and then do advocacy, messaging, and turnout.""
TWEET NO. 3 : ""Know why Rick Scott and Ron DeSantis won more PR voters than the Dems expected?
""Because they DID THE WORK.
""Put ideology aside. I'll bet you a dollar the FL Dem Party doesn't have a program to do this. I know the DNC, those incompetents, don't.""
TWEET NO. 4 : ""The AUDIENCE is there and primed. But Democrats in-fight, B.S. themselves blue, and pretend that some vague handwave message about Latinx issues will cover it.
""It won't. Stunt casting won't cover for a total lack of org and programmatic work on the ground.""
TWEET NO. 5 : ""Just watch. They'll say, ""We have a program and x people on the ground."" Reality: They don't have a program, and no one is on the ground doing it, registering, and comms to PR voters except the GOP.
""But they hate Trump. Yeah, and? That doesn't close the deal.""
The tone of disappointment and expectation is palpable. This line of directives seems tailored to show the Dems what they need to curry the vote of those new arrivals. This is actually something Wilson has been looking to take place for years now -- all the while it hasn't materialized into the expected windfall for Democrats.
Back in those days after the hurricane, Wilson anticipated a big party swing as a result of the exodus. “If you put an influx of 100,000 Puerto Ricans who vote Democratic eight times out of 10 in the Orlando area, there you go,” he said, predicting the newcomers would foster a resistance to Trump. Wilson’s resentment, however, did not translate effectively.
As I had pointed out at that same time, those Puerto Rican votes were not assured, as a large number of the transplants were registering Independent. Many were from the working and professional classes, and they had been fleeing due to the economic morass created by the Democratic Party stronghold on the island. There was ample opportunity for the Republicans to earn favor from these new residents of the state, I said, and that has in fact paid dividends.
Look over the recent elections in the state since the influx. The expected benefit did not show in 2016, as President Trump won the state in the general election. During the midterm election last fall, when there was a surge of Democratic wins and they took over the House, in Florida the GOP improved its hold across the state. Bill Nelson lost his longtime seat in the Senate, despite hailing from the Puerto Rican-rich Orlando area. Rick Scott edged out the victory in their race, due in large part to his stronger-than-expected performance with the Latino voters.
That Wilson harbors a deep disdain for the president is evident. To see that now transform, though, into a veiled effort to coach Democrats here in the state is a deeper curiosity to behold.

Homegrown Energy Production Funds Land and Water Conservation Fund,www.sunshinestatenews.com,Nancy Smith,04-03-2019,2019,4,http://www.sunshinestatenews.com/story/homegrown-energy-production-funds-land-and-water-conservation-fund,"Homegrown Energy Production Funds Land and Water Conservation Fund By April 3, 2019 - 7:00am Lauren Whritenour
President Trump recently signed into law the largest public lands bill to have been considered by Congress within the last 10 years. This bill will designate a total of 1.3 million acres of land to be preserved as wilderness. The bill also includes provision for the growth of several national parks and the creation of five new national monuments. In addition, this bill will permanently reauthorize the federal Land and Water Conservation Fund, which has been expired since last fall.
I applaud President Trump for making the choice to sign this bill and take steps towards protecting the environment for our nation. The five national monuments being designated thanks to this legislation are the Medgar and Myrlie Evers Home in Mississippi, the Mill Springs and Camp Nelson national monuments in Kentucky, the former Saint Francis Dam site in Southern California and the Jurassic National Monument in Utah.
There are many positive results of this bill and one of the most significant is that it will reauthorize the Land and Water Conservation Fund, which has supported more than 42,000 state and local projects throughout the United States since 1964. The funding comes almost entirely from revenue generated by offshore natural gas and oil development projects, which many people do not realize. Yes, royalties from the natural gas and oil industry fund our parks, monuments and recreation throughout the nation. This positive offshore energy benefit is widely unknown among the public and should be commended. Homegrown offshore energy development will need to continue in order for us to receive those funds.
President Trump’s unqualified support for this bill indicates his desire to protect our nation’s environment. The bill includes over 100 land conservation bills that have been combined to preserve 350 miles of river and to designate almost 700,000 acres of land to be used solely for recreation and conservation purposes. Such planned preservation will help to maintain our nation’s natural beauty for years to come. As the largest public lands bill considered by Congress in a decade, this bill may be one of the most important and memorable during President Trump’s time in office.
This action taken by President Trump will help to bring even more benefits from increasing domestic energy production here in the U.S. to the American people. The natural gas and oil industry supports millions of jobs across the country and many jobs in offshore energy exploration and production specifically pay over $100,000 per year, which is significantly higher than national average. This permanent authorization will allow the industry to fund important programs across the nation, from wildlife habitat protection to creation of new national parks. I commend the Congress and the Administration for signing into law this important bill that will benefit our nation for generations to come.

Plan Could Spur More Underground Power Lines,www.sunshinestatenews.com,Nancy Smith,04-03-2019,2019,4,http://www.sunshinestatenews.com/story/plan-could-spur-more-underground-power-lines,"Plan Could Spur More Underground Power Lines By April 3, 2019 - 7:00am Randy Fine
After hurricanes during the past three years knocked out electricity for millions of Floridians, lawmakers are moving forward with regulatory changes that could lead to more underground power lines.
But it would come at a cost.
A House panel this week approved a bill (HB 797) that would create a new process that would allow utilities to pass along costs to customers for storm-protection projects, including installing underground power lines. A similar bill (SB 796) has received unanimous approval from two committees.
Supporters say the proposals could help reduce the number of residents and businesses left in the dark when future hurricanes blow through Florida.
“Great bill. I went through the hurricane in 2004 and lost my power. My neighbors lost their power. My whole community lost their power,” said Rep. Michael Grant, a Port Charlotte Republican whose area sustained massive damage in 2004 from Hurricane Charley. “When you come to a situation where your schools are shut down for weeks at a time and you’re importing workers from Wisconsin in the middle of August to reconnect neighborhoods and businesses, you’ll understand why this bill is so important.”
But opponents expressed concerns about the revamped regulatory process, which would create a new avenue for utilities to recover costs from customers. Jon Moyle, an attorney for the Florida Industrial Power Users Group, said the bill would lead to a “one-way financial street” that would spur higher utility bills.
“This bill will increase rates,” said Moyle, whose group includes large electricity users and frequently is involved in utility-regulatory issues.
Lawmakers, regulators and utility companies have long faced questions about why more power lines are not buried underground in the hurricane-prone state. Those questions were refueled after widespread power outages from hurricanes Michael and Hermine in 2016, Hurricane Irma in 2017 and Hurricane Matthew in 2018.
But a big part of the issue is that it is expensive to take down overhead power lines in already-developed areas and bury them underground.
The legislation moving through the House and Senate deals with a process that utilities go through at the Florida Public Service Commission to submit plans for hardening their systems to better withstand punishing hurricanes --- and how such improvements should be financed.
Generally, utilities such as Florida Power & Light, Duke Energy Florida, Tampa Electric Co. and Gulf Power incorporate storm-hardening costs in their base electric rates. The Public Service Commission goes through months-long processes to determine base rates, which involve financial and technical issues that touch myriad parts of utility operations.
While base rates are set for multiple years, utilities also go before the commission annually for approval to pass along costs to customers for specific expenses. A large expense, for example, that is estimated each year and passed along to customers is the cost of natural gas and other fuel for power plants.
The House and Senate bills would set up a similar process for utilities to recover storm-protection costs, including the costs of putting power lines underground, outside of the base-rate process. The utilities would also be able to earn a rate of return --- profit --- on the projects.
Zayne Smith, a lobbyist for AARP Florida, told the House Government Operations & Technology Appropriations Subcommittee on Monday that her group opposes revamping the way utilities can recover the costs.
“AARP certainly supports a harder, stronger, more-resilient grid,” Smith said. “Our members depend on power more than probably many people do. But the way this bill is written will also shift costs to consumers more than it already is. Our contention is, keep it in the base rate.”
The House panel, however, voted unanimously to approve the bill. Sponsor Randy Fine, R-Palm Bay, pointed to the costs of restoring power after storms and the financial and personal impacts of outages on businesses and residents.
“Certainly, taking lines that go above ground and putting them underground will cost money. And there will be an expense associated with it,” Fine said. “But let’s talk about the cost of doing nothing.”"
Vern Buchanan's Retirement Savings Proposal Gains Traction on Capitol Hill,www.sunshinestatenews.com,Kevin Derby,04-02-2019,2019,4,http://www.sunshinestatenews.com/story/vern-buchanans-retirement-savings-proposal-gains-traction-capitol-hill,"Vern Buchanan's Retirement Savings Proposal Gains Traction on Capitol Hill By April 3, 2019 - 7:00am Vern Buchanan
From his perch on the U.S. House Ways & Means Committee, U.S. Rep. Vern Buchanan, R-Fla., was able to get his proposal to offer employees of small businesses better retirement benefits through the committee.
Buchanan introduced his “Retirement Security for American Workers Act” back in February 2017. When he talked about the proposal at the end of 2016, he said his legislation “makes it less costly for small businesses to offer retirement benefits, and could help the more than 76 million Americans who work for companies that do not offer the opportunity to save for a secure retirement.”
Buchanan’s bill allows small businesses to work together in “multiple employer plans” (MEPs) which he insists will lower costs and make more businesses offer retirement benefits. The Florida Republican cited figures from the Pew Charitable Trusts which shows more than a third--35 percent--of workers in the private sector over the age of 22 work for employers that do not offer retirement benefits.
Buchanan had some momentum with his bill at the end of last year, getting it through the House as part of U.S. Rep. Mike Kelly’s, R-Penn., “Family Savings Act” in October but the bill did not clear the U.S Senate.
Last week, Buchanan brought the bill back and he was able to roll it into the “Setting Every Community up for Retirement Enhancement (SECURE) Act” which makes it easier to offer annuities in 401(k)s and 403(b)s and raises the age for taking required minimum distributions (RMDs) from 70.5 to 72. The bill was introduced by U.S. Rep. Richard Neal, D-Mass., the chairman of the House Ways & Means Committee and has the support of U.S. Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas, the top Republican on the committee.
Buchanan weighed in on getting his proposal through the committee on Wednesday.
“Today’s committee passage brings us one step closer to helping millions of hardworking Americans who enter retirement without adequate savings,” Buchanan said. “I’m optimistic the full House will take up this important bill in the near future to help folks prepare for their golden years and invest in their future.
“Hopefully this will be the year my legislation goes to the president’s desk,” Buchanan added. “Congress needs to help Americans save for retirement.”
Paul Richman, the chief government and political affairs officer at the Insured Retirement Institute, praised Buchanan‘s proposal.
“Enactment of the Retirement Security for American Workers Act will be a critical step towards creating financial security during retirement. Revamping the rules and regulations to allow for MEPs to meet the needs and concerns of small employers will help to close the retirement coverage gap and improve the retirement outlook for millions of working Americans by expanding workers’ access to retirement plans,” said Richman.
Brady tipped his cap to “Representative Vern Buchanan…for [his] work on this important bill.”
U.S. Rep. Ron Kind, D-Wisc., is back as the main cosponsor of Buchanan’s bill and he is also behind Neal’s proposal.
There is a similar bill to the SECURE Act over in the U.S. Senate which U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, the chairman of the U.S. Senate Finance Committee, brought out on Monday. U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Oreg., the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, is backing Grassley’s proposal.
First elected to Congress in 2006, Buchanan represents parts of Southwestern Florida in Congress. Buchanan currently is one of the co-chairs of the Florida delegation and he leads Republicans the U.S. House Trade Subcommittee."

Did Toni Preckwinkle take campaigning lessons from Hillary Clinton?,www.chicagonow.com,Howard Moore,04-03-2019,2019,4,http://www.chicagonow.com/hippy-shakes/2019/04/did-toni-preckwinkle-take-campaigning-lessons-from-hillary-clinton/,"Tweet By Howard Moore , today at 9:35 am
We have a new Mayor-elect in Chicago. For the first time, voters in the city have elected an African-American woman. Surprisingly, no shockingly, it's not the African-American woman you would have been sure would have won just six months ago.
Like her or hate her, Toni Preckwinkle was the most qualified candidate to become the next mayor of Chicago.
She started her career by teaching History in the Chicago area for ten years. Knowing how the school system works is a big part of being the Mayor in Chicago.
Her next step was moving into politics by running for Alderman. It took her three tries, but she was finally elected to that post, from the Hyde Park area, on the cities South Side. She was reelected four more times. Preckwinkle knows how the city council works. She knows how to deal with the Mayor. Pretty important stuff, right?
In 2010, she was elected Cook County Board President. Toni has been there since then, trying to manage a budget that never had enough money.
The next step in Toni Preckwinkle's political career was obvious. She was going to be Mayor. So how does a person who is so qualified for a position lose? How does she lose in a landslide? How does she lose every ward in the city? EVERY. SINGLE. ONE!
Sure, she had political baggage. She has connections to disgraced Alderman Ed Burke. That didn't seem to hurt her in the February election, when she finished second to Lori Lightfoot. Sure, she came up with that stupid tax on soft drinks which pissed off a lot of people. Toni figured out it was a bad idea and rescinded the tax. While it may be a contributor to what occurred last night, you wouldn't think that one misstep would lead to that big of a historic loss of an election, would you?
So what led to Toni Preckwinkle losing the election? Why is Toni Preckwinkle not the Mayor-elect of Chicago?
Maybe Chicago was ready for change...maybe. Maybe Chicago was ready for a non-machine candidate...maybe. Or maybe Toni Preckwinkle just took it for granted that she was going to be elected....maybe.
There were fourteen candidates running for Mayor, in the primary election. When they had their first public forum, thirteen of them showed up. Guess who was missing? Toni Preckwinkle. It was said she had a conflicting engagement. What could be more than important than being at the first forum. Blowing off forums was repeated multiple times after that.
Then there was the campaigning...the actual part of hitting the streets and meeting the people...yanno, the voters! Lori Lightfoot was everywhere. We rarely saw Toni north of Madison street. Hey Toni, there are lots of voters in Rogers Park...in Edgewater...in Lakeview. Maybe you should have tried harder to get our vote. Maybe you shouldn't have assumed you were going to get our vote.
Remember the Presidential election of 2016...yeah, I know...how can we forget? Remember when Hillary Clinton thought knew she was going to win the election? Remember when Hillary Clinton stopped going to Minnesota and Wisconsin because those states were in the bag? Remember when Hillary Clinton lost those states? Remember when Hillary Clinton lost the election?
Toni Preckwinkle did the same thing as Clinton. It didn't work for Hillary and it didn't work for Toni. That's how the best qualified candidate isn't President of the United States. That's how the best qualified candidate isn't the Mayor-elect of Chicago. That's how the best qualified candidate gets only twenty-six percent of the vote. That's how the best qualified candidate loses every ward in the city, including her own.
The ghost of 2016 reared it's ugly head again in 2019. Hopefully, it's a lesson learned for the next best qualified candidate.

Tennessee Smokies Preview,www.chicagonow.com,Michael Ernst,04-03-2019,2019,4,http://www.chicagonow.com/cubs-den/2019/04/tennessee-smokies-preview/,"By Michael Ernst , today at 9:15 am Nico Hoerner (Photo by Stephanie Lynn)
As we speculated all offseason, top prospect Nico Hoerner will indeed skip over High-A Myrtle Beach and begin the 2019 season in Tennessee. His presence gives a big boost of interest to a less than stellar cast of position players scheduled to play for the Smokies this season, although Jared Young will be another highlight as he looks to build upon his 2018 breakout and impressive showing this spring. The team also features good depth behind the plate.
What the lineup may lack in prospects is more than made up for in the Tennessee rotation as the Smokies already boast seven good starting pitching candidates, and that is without including Oscar de la Cruz who will miss the first month due to suspension, and Erick Leal who stayed back in Mesa to rehab. Michael Rucker and Thomas Hatch couldn't crack a deep Iowa staff this spring, but will jockey early on for the first shot at a promotion. Keegan Thompson and Justin Steele also return after strong second half showings last year. Beating out Alex Lange for promotions this spring were Cory Abbott , Tyson Miller and Bailey Clark . With Steele not fully stretched out after a minor setback early in spring, expect one of Miller or Clark to piggyback off him to open the season. Position Players
Top prospects to watch: I know some fans will feel the Cubs are rushing yet another top prospect, but I have to stand behind the organization's decision to send Nico Hoerner here to begin 2019 despite his lack of Minor League experience last season (14 total games, just 4 with South Bend). The kid can flat out rake. His ceiling may not be as high but at this stage of his career Hoerner is as, or more advanced at the plate than Kris Bryant and Kyle Schwarber were coming out of the draft. And remember, Hoerner also made up for some of his lost time when he starred in the Arizona Fall League, the only member of the entire 2018 MLB draft to participate. Just like he has anywhere he has played, Hoerner produced ( .337/.362/.506) . Jared Young (photo by Rikk Carlson)
The other main guy to keep an eye on is Jared Young . The Cubs 2018 Minor League Player of the Year split last season between South Bend and Myrtle Beach, finishing with a combined .300 average and 16 home runs. The former collegiate middle infielder also learned a new position, first base, and this season will be asked to expand his defensive profile to the outfield corners. At the plate, I hope to see more patience, and a greater willingness to drive the ball into the left centerfield gap.
The team is also deep at backstop, led by another 2018 breakout prospect Johnny Pereda . Blessed with a big arm, and beginning to add some bulk to his frame, Pereda used his improved strength to increase his production on offense as well. He always made frequent contact, but now his ground balls and line drives reach the outfield with more frequency, and he also flashed home run power for the first time last season. If he shows a willingness to turn on the ball more often this season, we could see yet another bump in that area forthcoming.
Others: Joining Pereda behind the plate will be P.J. Higgins and Ian Rice . Higgins is the superior athlete and defender. Rice the more powerful hitter. Both possess a good knowledge of the strike zone and draw more than their share of walks. I expect Pereda to receive approximately half of the playing time at catcher, with Higgins and Rice splitting the rest, although that split should heavily favor Higgins. Rice will get the bulk of his playing time as a DH, and then subbing at first when Young moves to the outfield. Higgins has experience at both third and second base so don't be surprised to see him take reps at both, especially considering the Smokies are carrying just one backup infielder.

The value of having standards (or values),www.chicagonow.com,Margaret H. Laing,04-03-2019,2019,4,http://www.chicagonow.com/margaret-serious/2019/04/the-value-of-having-standards-or-values/,"By Margaret H. Laing , today at 9:00 am Source: Reusableart.com
The present series -- the Serious series, if you will -- about values has made me think of many things I value. One of those things is having standards, saying that I value some things over others.
I have on my desk a button I picked up at a rally for the striking Chicago Symphony Orchestra musicians. It reads ""i support cso musicians"" across its middle; I'll forgive the all-lower-case letters for such a viewpoint. Across the round top of the badge is ""#stand with your musicians,"" and I do. Across the round bottom of the badge is #keep your standards high.""
I do that latter hashtag, or motto if you prefer -- and not only in musical matters. If I didn't, I might use any spelling I wanted to use, any sentence structure -- or non-structure -- and just leave you to figure out what you want to think.
But I'm Margaret H. Laing, not James Joyce. I have my standards, and I will keep them. That's how I can get my ideas across to you, and also how I can get my old ideas back to myself when I haven't seen them in a while.
I learned that after a few years of writing in my diary. I'd use shorthand, since I was tired, abbreviations like ""the usual Wednesday"" or ""a tough lesson with Mrs. C about that hard piece of Bach.""
Well, it wasn't very long before I looked at those notes and thought ""What went on Wednesday?"" or ""Which piece of Bach?"" Even for myself, I had to have standards.
I valued (there it is again) looking back into the past, even the recent past, to find what I needed to carry forward.
As for other values, I have a small apartment. I literally don't have room in my life for some categories of things. Also, when I do make room physically, I need to make room on the clock. Nothing is around me that does not get used -- not for long, anyway. (I can think of some things I'd rather turn into cash.)
So if I value something enough to have it around, I think it is better than what I don't keep near me. I think it is worth spending time with and something else isn't, especially with recent events reminding me that time is limited.
So that's why I've used this time to write about the value of things and concepts -- because I know they have value.

Kirby (NYSE:KEX) was downgraded by Zacks Investment Research from a “hold” rating to a “sell” rating in a research report issued to clients and investors on Wednesday, Zacks.com reports.
According to Zacks, “Shares of Kirby Corporation have shed more than 10% of its value over the past six months due to numerous headwinds. Sluggish oilfield activity and volatility in the commodity’s price might hurt its distribution and services unit in 2019. Additionally, high operating expenses have been limiting the company's bottom-line growth. This downside is likely to affect its first-quarter 2019 results, set to be released on May 2. The company's increased leverage also raises concerns. Notably, debt-to-capitalization ratio, a measure of Kirby’s financial leverage, at the end of 2018 was 30.5% compared with 24.2% a year ago. The negativity surrounding the stock is evident from the Zacks Consensus Estimate for full-year earnings being revised 1.6% downward in the last 90 days. However, Kirby's 2019 outlook for the inland marine transportation market is encouraging owing to expectations of higher customer demand.” Get Kirby alerts:
