I'll ask YOU the exact same question I asked a couple of posters (such as Caro Lewellyn) yesterday on Robert Vincent's thread here who posed the exact same sentiment yesterday as you have this morning: as opposed to WHAT as the ALTERNATIVE?
If that alternative is for us ""deplorables"" to passively surrender our liberties to the Left and let it establish the tyrannical Marxist dictatorship over this nation, sorry, I'll take my chances on the civil war, because if we passively let the Left have its way in this country, once it establishes the kind of regime over this nation that it has such wet dreams about, the GULAGS and the GENOCIDE won't be far behind, and thus OUR lives and those of our progeny won't be worth a Confederate nickel at that point, therefore, HOW can we wind up any WORSE off with a civil war, the worst that happens is that we die in that civil war, but I think it's STILL an infinitely more preferable death than what the Left has in mind for us, because at least with the former, we have the chance to take out some of them WITH us.
As I posted on Vincent's thread yesterday and have oft-posted before on this site and will post AGAIN: my father did NOT spend more than 20+ years in the U.S. Navy, nor my brother-in-law the better part of a decade in the U.S. Air Force, just to learn how to bow to leftist tyranny - nor that their SONS should learn how to, either."

Danny Dyer is to be filmed spending time in the terrifying presence of self-styled ‘Brexit Hardman’ Steve Baker, his agent has today confirmed.
Speaking on behalf of his client, Simon Williams told reporters, “Danny has made documentaries about spending time getting to know shady members of the criminal underworld in the past, so popping down to the Houses of Parliament shouldn’t put him too much out of his comfort zone.
“When he heard Tory MP Steve Baker refer to himself as the ‘Brexit Hardman’ the other day, Danny was immediately intrigued, as he’d never even heard of him before.”
He went on, “The documentary will see Danny Dyer exploring the roots of this scary hardman’s difficult and gritty upbringing in the pleasant Cornish market town of St Austell, through to when he fell in with the wrong crowd whilst studying computing at one of the country’s most elite universities, before he worked his way up through the ranks of the notorious ERG gang.
“We can expect to see Danny enjoying a nice cup of tea with Steve in the House of Commons bar and joining him as he attends his local church on a Sunday morning, as well as meeting with residents of Wycombe to discuss their feelings about having such a formidable and threatening individual representing them in Parliament.”
The documentary will air later this year unless Steve Baker is unhappy with how he is portrayed and threatens the producers with his enforcer, known only by their mysterious moniker ‘Nanny’. "
Zuckerberg call for tech rules gets cold reception,thehill.com,gevans@thehill.com (Harper Neidig),04-03-2019,2019,4,https://thehill.com/policy/technology/437055-zuckerberg-call-for-tech-rules-gets-cold-reception,"Zuckerberg call for tech rules gets cold reception By Harper Neidig - 04/03/19 06:00 AM EDT
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg Hillicon Valley: Google workers want Heritage president off AI council | Facebook cracks down on Indian political party's pages | FBI failing to notify all cyber victims Facebook adds feature explaining prioritized news feed posts UK watchdog: Zuckerberg can show he's serious about privacy by dropping appeal of fine MORE raised eyebrows over the weekend with a call for regulating internet giants, but his proposals are facing skepticism from the social network’s critics.
Regulators, lawmakers and activists who have grown wary of Facebook saw Zuckerberg’s move less as a mea culpa and more as an effort to shape future regulations in his favor and counter more drastic proposals like Sen. Elizabeth Warren ADVERTISEMENT
“Mark Zuckerberg doesn’t get to make the rules anymore,” Rep. David Cicilline David Nicola Cicilline Tech watchdogs see red flags as Apple expands House Dems support GOP push for details on Rosenstein in fight for Mueller report Clyburn: Question of obstruction of justice is 'still on the table' MORE (D-R.I.), who chairs the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust, wrote in a tweet. “Facebook is under criminal and civil investigation. It has shown it cannot regulate itself. Does anyone even want his advice?”
A top regulator in the United Kingdom, Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham, whose office fined Facebook about $560,000 last year over its handling of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, also pushed back against Zuckerberg. Denham said Zuckerberg could show his sincerity about welcoming regulatory oversight by dropping Facebook’s appeal of the fine.
“In light of Mark Zuckerberg’s statements over the weekend about the need for increased regulation across four areas, including privacy, I expect Facebook to review their current appeal against the [Information Commissioner’s Office] £500,000 fine — the maximum available under the old rule — for contravening UK privacy laws,” Denham said in a statement.
A spokeswoman for Facebook did not respond when asked for comment.
In his Washington Post op-ed, Zuckerberg highlighted four areas where he believed Facebook and other internet platforms could benefit from greater oversight: content moderation, election integrity, data privacy and data portability. ADVERTISEMENT The social network has faced withering criticism over its efforts to combat disinformation and toxic content, as well as its handling of user information. Facebook has struggled to respond to the increased attention on its business practices and the public’s evolving expectations for tech giants.
Zuckerberg’s proposal appears to be part of an effort to set clear oversight principles for the industry and shift the burden that has come with Facebook effectively being allowed to regulate itself.
The company has announced a proposal to create an independent oversight panel to review and set guidelines on content moderation. Zuckerberg says users would be able to appeal Facebook’s enforcement actions to the board. The social network this week invited public input on the proposal.
It has also reformed its political advertising policies in the years since the 2016 presidential race to promote more transparency about who is buying ads and has ramped up its content oversight to track and crack down on disinformation campaigns.
“However, deciding whether an ad is political isn’t always straightforward,” Zuckerberg wrote in his opinion piece. “Our systems would be more effective if regulation created common standards for verifying political actors.”
And as Congress mulls a potential tech privacy bill, the Facebook CEO called for the U.S. to implement data regulations that apply uniformly across the country. That echoes the tech industry line that Congress should wipe out a tough new privacy law in California and head off other states from trying to implement their own regulations.
A consistent set of rules governing internet privacy “will ensure that the Internet does not get fractured, entrepreneurs can build products that serve everyone, and everyone gets the same protections,” Zuckerberg wrote.
Zuckerberg’s proposals, though, have gotten a cold reception from both ends of the political spectrum.
Brendan Carr, a Republican on the Federal Communications Commission, said it would be a mistake to invite more government involvement in speech.
“Outsourcing censorship to the government is not just a bad idea, it would violate the First Amendment,” Carr said in a tweet.
And the reliably conservative Wall Street Journal editorial board pushed back as well, saying that regulations would hurt small businesses trying to compete on the internet.
“Before he invites the protection of the political class, Mr. Zuckerberg should have Facebook fix Facebook,” the board wrote.
Critics who have been calling for the government to take action against the company over its privacy practices and market power are wary of Facebook’s efforts to propose potential fixes.
Zuckerberg’s call for tougher regulations also comes close to a year after he was hauled before Congress to testify over Facebook’s data practices and the Cambridge Analytica scandal, in which the political consulting firm harvested millions of Facebook users’ data without their consent. The Facebook CEO faced tough questions from lawmakers over two days and 10 hours of testimony. And while he offered a strong defense of his company, he also vowed to address their concerns.
Since then, Facebook has found itself under fire on a number of fronts, from data privacy to antitrust concerns floated by President Trump Donald John Trump Colbert mocks Trump for 'oranges' gaffe Dem wins Trump district in swing-state Pennsylvania Trump says health care plan will be first vote after 2020 election MORE to allegations of anti-conservative bias. And the company is likely to be on the hot seat with both 2020 Democrats and conservative Republicans eager to take on tech companies.
Zuckerberg will face a challenge trying to sway those critics.
Sally Hubbard, the director of enforcement strategy at the Open Markets Institute, believes that Facebook’s business model is creating harm for which Zuckerberg is trying to dodge responsibility.
“I think he’s trying to avoid what we really need, which is to stop the massive collection of data and to stop these algorithms that prioritize engagement and elevate the [harmful] content,” Hubbard told The Hill.
“In my view, anything that’s going to be effective is going to have to have a very negative effect on their profitability unless they change their business model.”"

The Uncracked Problem With 33: Mathematician Solves 64-year-old 'Diophantine Puzzle',www.newsweek.com,Aristos Georgiou,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsweek.com/uncracked-problem-mathematician-diophantine-puzzle-1384422,"An American mathematician has cracked part of a problem that had remained unsolved for 64 years.
Andrew Booker, Reader of Pure Mathematics at the University of Bristol in the U.K., worked out how to express the number 33 as the sum of three cubes.
Mathematicians have been trying to solve problems like this since at least 1955. Essentially, they have been attempting to determine whether whole numbers can be expressed as the sum of three cubes—or in other words, whether the equation k = x³+ y³+ z³ always has a solution.
These problems are types of “Diophantine equations,"" which are named after Diophantus of Alexandria—an ancient Greek mathematician renowned for his contributions to the field of algebra.
Despite huge advances in computer technology in recent decades, there remained two whole numbers under 100—33 and 42—that nobody had been able to express as the sum of three cubes. (There are a group of numbers which are known to have no solution—those which leave a remainder of 4 or 5 when divided by 9.)
But Booker has now shown that the number 33 can be expressed like so: (8,866,128,975,287,528)³ + (–8,778,405,442,862,239)³ + (–2,736,111,468,807,040)³.
The mathematician was inspired to try and tackle the problem after watching a YouTube video featuring a former professor at Bristol, Tim Browning.
""The video was called 'The Uncracked Problem,'"" Booker said in a statement. ""That made me want to have a go!""
And with the help of a computer, he was able to identify the solution.
""I had a pretty good guess that I'd find something for one of the numbers below 1000,” he said. “But I didn't know it was going to be the number 33. We don't know if the remaining numbers have infinitely many solutions, or how frequent those solutions are. It's quite mysterious.""
Some mathematicians have suggested that some of the remaining unsolved numbers—aside from the group which leave a remainder of 4 or 5—are simply impossible to solve. However, developments like the latest solution suggest that all eligible numbers have a solution.
""This one's right at the boundary between what we know how to prove and what we suspect might be undecidable,” Booker said.
The mathematician is now working with Andrew Sutherland of MIT in an attempt to find the solution for the final unsolved number below 100—42.

El agente es de apellido Dacunda y presta servicio en la ciudad de Esquina. La pelea vecinal se produjo en una zona conocida como “Bananal”.
Un agen­te po­li­cial fue de­te­ni­do en Es­qui­na, don­de pres­ta ser­vi­cio, y se le ini­ció una cau­sa por “a­bu­so de ar­ma de fue­go”, ya que es­tá sos­pe­cha­do de ha­ber ac­cio­na­do una pis­to­la en el mar­co de una pe­lea ve­ci­nal que ha­bría pro­ta­go­ni­za­do. Por el mo­men­to, se en­cuen­tra in­co­mu­ni­ca­do.
Lo que se se­ña­ló des­de la Fuer­za, es que se tra­ta de un hom­bre de ape­lli­do Da­cun­da, quien fue de­te­ni­do y lle­va­do a la co­mi­sa­ría Pri­me­ra, tras un in­ci­den­te ca­lle­je­ro re­gis­tra­do du­ran­te la no­che del lu­nes.
El agen­te es­ta­ba de fran­co en el mo­men­to del en­fren­ta­mien­to, que se re­gis­tró en una zo­na co­no­ci­da co­mo “Ba­na­nal”, cuan­do va­rias per­so­nas se pe­le­a­ron en una ca­lle de tie­rra, de­trás del hos­pi­tal “San Ro­que” de la lo­ca­li­dad, en un si­tio en el que se ha­lla un pa­re­dón fren­te a una ca­lle de tie­rra.
Allí ha­brí­an es­ta­do va­rios hom­bres quie­nes, por ra­zo­nes que no tras­cen­die­ron, co­men­za­ron a pe­le­ar. En ese mar­co, se in­di­có que Da­cun­da ex­tra­jo un ar­ma de fue­go y efec­tuó al me­nos un dis­pa­ro, que ha­bría si­do a mo­do de ame­na­za, di­ri­gi­do ha­cia una per­so­na.
Tras es­to, agen­tes po­li­cia­les de la co­mi­sa­ría Pri­me­ra fue­ron has­ta el si­tio, cer­ca de la es­qui­na de An­tár­ti­da Ar­gen­ti­na y Re­con­quis­ta, pa­ra evi­tar que la vio­len­cia si­ga en au­men­to.
Es así que, lue­go de al­gu­nas ave­ri­gua­cio­nes, se de­ci­dió tras­la­dar a Da­cun­da has­ta la sec­cio­nal men­cio­na­da, en la cual per­ma­ne­ce de­mo­ra­do.
Ade­más de la cau­sa por “a­bu­so de ar­ma”, se le ini­ció otra por “in­cum­pli­mien­to de fun­cio­na­rio pú­bli­co”.
Si bien des­de la Fuer­za no se die­ron de­ta­lles so­bre el efec­ti­vo, se con­sul­tó con fuen­tes lo­ca­les y se se­ña­ló que el agen­te pres­ta­ría ser­vi­cios en la co­mi­sa­ría Se­gun­da, aun­que tam­bién es­tu­vo en Go­ya. Apa­ren­te­men­te, se­ría oriun­do de la ciu­dad de Co­rrien­tes.
Asi­mis­mo, se in­di­có que du­ran­te la tar­de de ayer, pe­ri­tos po­li­cia­les fue­ron has­ta el si­tio del in­ci­den­te pa­ra bus­car al­gún pro­yec­til u otra pis­ta que sir­va pa­ra es­cla­re­cer to­do.
Has­ta el cie­rre de edi­ción, no se in­for­mó si hu­bo al­gún ha­llaz­go. Por otro la­do, se di­jo, ex­tra­o­fi­cial­men­te, que se efec­tuó un alla­na­mien­to a la re­si­den­cia del agen­te, aun­que es­to no fue con­fir­ma­do por las au­to­ri­da­des."
"Al-Qaeda Capitalizes on Protests in Algeria, Calls for Establishment of Islamic State | Breitbart",www.breitbart.com,LuciusAnnaeusSeneca,03-29-2019,2019,3,https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2019/03/29/al-qaeda-capitalizes-protests-algeria-calls-establishment-islamic-state/#post-4,"I wouldn't worry much about that, at least for the foreseeable future. The current concern for most Algerians is likely be one of who, or what, comes next. See my comment above.
It is ironic that Bouteflika, in seeking to rid the military of those whom he deemed a threat, promoted Gaid-Saleh to run it in their place. And it was this latter who has forced him out. The Algerian military remains strong, and a respected institution in a country where most civil institutions are regarded as corrupt or irrelevant, or both.
And perhaps that should be reassuring. The Algerian military fought and won a vicious civil war i the1990s against jihadists. Most observers would likely agree that it could do the same, if necessary, once again."

It is the end of an era, as he had been in power for 20 years, put there by the National Liberation Front (FLN) and more recently kept in power by family members and a close circle of supporters whose main objective seems to have been entrenching themselves in power. Now all have been swept away, and the question is who, and especially what, will fill the vacuum that is left.
And the power vacuum is quite evident. Bouteflika spent his presidency in eliminating his revolutionary-era rivals in the military, security services, and government. And those he put in power do do this also put out of power, or kept from power, anyone who they deemed a rival to their power or control. There are few left outside of the military who may be capable of national-level leadership"

"If He Wants To Win, Joe Biden Should Stop Apologizing",thefederalist.com,Warren Henry,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/03/wants-win-joe-biden-stop-apologizing/,"By Warren Henry April 3, 2019
Joe Biden seems determined to blow up his campaign before it launches. The former veep’s recent actions suggest he does not understand the central question of the 2020 primaries or the value proposition of his candidacy.
Team Biden’s trial balloon about naming Stacey Abrams as Joe’s running mate predictably exploded in their faces . Moreover, it highlighted concerns about Biden’s age and lack of wokeness. Fortunately for Joe, this sort of kerfuffle probably does not reach the average voter.
Biden’s apologies for his record, however, are getting more attention and are more dangerous to his campaign. Biden does not seem to understand the 2020 primaries are about whether the Democrats remain the next version of the Party of Obama, or lurch drastically towards socialism and identitarianism. Consequently, Biden is abandoning his strengths to play on the turf of the narrow, “upstairs” progressive elites .
Consider how Democrats like to label themselves: Republicans identify most with conservatism, Democrats identify most with Obama; Democrats split in ideological identification https://t.co/7NKhd2QsTf pic.twitter.com/kLQP0vVZgp

The top choices are “Obama Democrat,” moderate, or liberal. Progressive ranks further down, with democratic socialist and socialist near the bottom. Biden’s brand is clear and generally more popular than those of his rivals.
Many pundits believe Biden will collapse like Jeb Bush in 2016, thinking his poll lead now is simply name ID. They may be right. But that name ID is related to Barack Obama, whose administration is far more popular with Democrats now than George W. Bush’s was with the GOP in 2015. Not even Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib dare cross Obama.
Biden has plenty of goodwill among rank-and-file Democrats. In a recent focus group of African-American women likely to vote in the South Carolina primary , one said “it’s the closest we can get to a [third] term for Obama [without] electing Michelle.” The only attack that registered was the Anita Hill issue.
The focus group mostly dismissed the attacks on any of the candidates the media thinks are a big deal. Again, politics ultimately happens more in the real world than on cable news panels and social media.
Therefore, Biden should stop apologizing. Rather, if and when he launches, he should find the earliest opportunity to say something like this:
“Like all of the candidates in the race, I have apologized for some of my record. I’ve publicly apologized for not running a better hearing when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment. And I have regrets about parts of the crime bill I pushed back in 1994. Regrets are the costs of experience. If you think experience isn’t important, take a look at the White House right now.
“Despite those mistakes, Barack Obama took a very close look at me and my entire record, along with other people. Barack personally chose me to be his vice president, to work alongside him making all the tough decisions America faced in the years after the financial crisis. You know, he’s a pretty good judge of these things.
“Now, I know my friend Barack is not endorsing anyone in the primaries; that’s fine. I think he understands trying to play kingmaker can backfire .
“Also, I have learned from experience. This is why I championed the Violence Against Women Act and campaign against campus sexual assault today. It’s why I worked to reform the sentencing disparity for crack versus powder cocaine. I am sure the other candidates feel the same way about their records. We cannot change the past, but we can learn and work to make tomorrow better.
“I know there are people in the media who think I have no business running. But if we’re going to judge people’s records, we should look at how pundits have done recently. In 2016, they told us Donald Trump was not a serious candidate. They gave him billions in free TV time. Then they told everyone Trump had almost no shot to win, which probably depressed our turnout.
“Did they learn anything from 2016? Since the midterms, the media has promoted a few Democrats from safe seats—and some losing candidates—as the future of our party. Our party is a big tent. But our House majority was built by dozens of moderates flipping seats from red to blue all over this country, especially in the Midwest, in states like Iowa. If we want to win in 2020, we must win states we lost last time. I don’t hear the media explaining how the other candidates in this race are going to do that.
“Some pundits claim to know exactly who the base of our party is. But I think Democrats are going to look at my entire record—and others’ records—with the maturity that Barack Obama did. Democrats care more about building a better America than digging through our high school yearbooks. And in the fall of 2020, Democrats are going to want a heavyweight standing toe-to-toe with Trump on that debate stage. And that’s why I’m going to be our party’s nominee next year.”
There are risks to baiting the establishment media, but acceptable ones. Those attacking Biden for being a white man will continue to do so. If he personally apologizes to Hill, they will move the goal posts. The woke faction is going to kick Joe in his gleaming choppers no matter what. The rest of Big Media is going to suddenly realize “What, Me Too?” Joe was always a bit creepy and a gaffe machine. Biden cannot hope to be the media’s darling.
Instead, Biden should remind Democrats why they like him, and everyone else that he is the big dog in the race—because he is until proven otherwise. Democrats love their betas, but when beating Donald Trump is the endgame, the alpha candidate is going to look pretty good.
To the chagrin of the left, Democrats often pick the “electable” candidate against a GOP incumbent. The issue being tested is whether they want to rerun George McGovern’s 1972 debacle instead.
Lastly, voters like authenticity. While Biden may continue to strike woke notes to display his evolution, he generally should run as Joe Biden. If you are Biden and this is your last hurrah, would you want to lose pretending to be someone else? Warren Henry is the nom de plume of an attorney practicing in the State of Illinois."
Trump lets loose at the NRCC’s spring dinner,www.politico.com,politico.com,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/newsletters/playbook/2019/04/03/trump-lets-loose-at-the-nrccs-spring-dinner-420544,"President Donald Trump speaks at the NRCC Annual Spring Dinner on Tuesday, April 2. | Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images DRIVING THE DAY THE PRESIDENT spoke Tuesday night at the NRCC’s annual spring dinner at the National Building Museum. Eli Stokols of the L.A. Times, Tuesday’s intrepid pooler, sat through the one-hour-twenty-eight-minute address, and here are the highlights:
-- “[TRUMP] said House Republicans were ‘just taking a little break’ [from controlling the House] and joked that he took some of the blame for November's results: ‘They blamed me. I said what the hell do I have to do with it.’ But he predicted, ‘we’re gonna take the House back.’”
-- TRUMP ON BIDEN: “‘The socialists are really taking care of him,’ Trump said, apparently insinuating that Bernie Sanders supporters were behind recent stories about former Vice President Joe Biden making some women uncomfortable. ‘Our former vice president … I was going to say welcome to the world, Joe. You having a good time, Joe?’”
-- TRUMP ON AOC: “‘The Great New Deal, done by a young bartender, 29 years old,’ Trump said.”
-- TRUMP ON HEALTH CARE: “Continuing to speak about the raw politics of various issues, Trump claimed that Republicans have the immigration issue, but indicated that Democrats have the edge in one area: ‘They have healthcare right now … We have to take that away from them. We have to protect and cannot run away from a thing called preexisting conditions…”
“‘If you don’t support it, you have no chance of winning,’ he went on. ‘The Republican Party will be the champion of preexisting conditions ... not only for politics, it’s also the right thing.’ … ‘I will be asking that this be my first vote immediately after the election,’ he said predicting that Republicans will win back the presidency and both chambers of Congress.
“Trump expressed regret about failing to repeal and replace Obamacare in the last Congress, obliquely complaining about former Speaker Paul Ryan and former Sen. John McCain. ‘We blew it last time … Man, I was fed a bill of goods.’”
NOTE: It was supposed to be the first vote after the last election!
WHAT PAUL RYAN IS UP TO … JANESVILLE GAZETTE: “Ryan said he is working at ... the offices of a foundation he is establishing to work on the ideas in two laws he pushed through Congress to address poverty. His longtime chief of staff, Andy Speth, is running the American Idea Foundation, he said. The focus is to make sure the laws are ‘properly implemented,’ he said.
“Longtime Ryan campaign finance director Susan Jacobson, who is working for the foundation, said it will be launched later this year. Ryan said he also will teach economics and government courses at a Midwestern university. He couldn’t say where but said it would be announced soon. And he’ll be doing speaking engagements and is on the boards of some charities that focus on poverty, including one where he joins NFL great Deion Sanders to keep kids out of gangs in North Dallas, he said.” Gazette
THE BIG PICTURE … WAPO’S SEUNG MIN KIM and ERICA WERNER: “Trump leaves Washington reeling with policy whiplash as he struggles with domestic agenda”: “‘Obviously this is a president who tends sometimes to move on his own and then obviously has some of those conversations later,’ Senate Majority Whip John Thune (R-S.D.) said Tuesday of Trump’s recent push on health care and the border. ‘That’s the dynamic that everybody up here deals with.’
“During a conversation Monday, the majority leader made the case that while the GOP-led Senate could pass a health-care bill endorsed by Trump, the president would not be able to support the product that would emerge from the House once Democrats got their hands on it, the official said. McConnell told reporters Tuesday that he had a ‘good conversation’ with Trump and that he and the president were now on the same page. …
“‘I made it clear to him we were not going to be doing that in the Senate,’ McConnell said of health care, stressing the challenges of writing legislation that could pass muster with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). ‘We don’t have a misunderstanding about that.’” WaPo
POLITICO/MORNING CONSULT POLL ... STEVEN SHEPARD: ""Poll: Majority of voters don't trust Trump on health care"": ""The survey, conducted in the days after the Trump administration asked a federal court to strike down the entire Affordable Care Act, finds that a plurality of voters support former President Barack Obama’s signature legislation. Voters also trust Democrats over Republicans when it comes to health care, and a majority has little faith in the president to make the system better."" POLITICO
NYT’S ALEX BURNS and JONATHAN MARTIN: “Trump’s Takeover of the Republican Party Is Almost Complete”
ON BIDEN …
-- NYT’S SHERYL GAY STOLBERG and SYDNEY EMBER: “Biden’s Tactile Politics Threaten His Return in the #MeToo Era”: “Joseph R. Biden Jr. came up in politics as an old-school backslapper whose greatest strength was his ability to connect. He doled out handshakes and hugs to friends and strangers alike, and his tendency to lavish his affections on women and girls was so central to his persona that it became fodder for late-night television jokes.
“But the political ground has shifted under Mr. Biden, and his tactile style of retail politicking is no longer a laughing matter in the era of #MeToo. Now, as he considers a run for president, Mr. Biden is struggling to prevent a strength from turning into a crippling liability; on Tuesday alone, two more women told The New York Times that the former vice president’s touches made them uncomfortable.
“For Mr. Biden, 76, the risks are obvious: the accusations feed into a narrative that he is a relic of the past, unsuited to represent his party in the modern era, against an incumbent president whose treatment of women should be a central line of attack. Mr. Biden has denied acting inappropriately but has said he will ‘listen respectfully.’
“So far, no prominent Democrat has suggested he not run, and the women complaining about him have not claimed sexual harassment or assault. Other women have stepped forward to say Mr. Biden’s touches were welcome. But the accusations lodged against Mr. Biden have raised questions about when a ‘tactile politician’ crosses the line into inappropriateness.” NYT
-- MORE WOMEN: “Caitlyn Caruso, a former college student and sexual assault survivor, said Mr. Biden rested his hand on her thigh — even as she squirmed in her seat to show her discomfort — and hugged her ‘just a little bit too long’ at an event on sexual assault at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. She was 19. …
“D. J. Hill, 59, a writer who recalled meeting Mr. Biden in 2012 at a fund-raising event in Minneapolis, said that when she and her husband, Robert, stepped up to take their photograph with the vice president, he put his hand on her shoulder and then started dropping it down her back, which made her ‘very uncomfortable.’”
-- MARC CAPUTO, NATASHA KORECKI and ALEX THOMPSON, “New accusations strain Biden defense”: “The controversy surrounding Joe Biden’s past physical behavior with women seemed to have stopped metastasizing after a team of Democratic defenders fanned out in his defense, seeking to knock down the notion that his tendency to be touchy with women was anything more than innocent affection. ...
“Prominent female voices including former Biden staffers, former Obama White House adviser Valerie Jarrett, actress-turned-activist Alyssa Milano and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi publicly voiced their support during the day, providing a degree of encouragement to Biden backers, supporters and possible staff hires who have watched with dread as his team struggled with the accusations of the first two women who said he made them feel uncomfortable in unrelated instances.” POLITICO
-- AGAIN, WHERE IS JOE BIDEN? Not in the race, not giving interviews and allowing this story to continue absolutely uninterrupted.

THE STEP BACK … WSJ’S KEN THOMAS: “Joe Biden’s Long History Shadows 2020 Bid”: “If Joe Biden enters the presidential race, he’s betting he can appeal to a silent majority in the party now being overlooked by a vocal, liberal base demanding generational change in leadership.
“Such a candidacy would be powered by his status as one of the oldest and most centrist of the potential Democratic nominees. That same profile also represents his biggest challenge: overcoming his image as a man who came up in an earlier era.
“In speeches, he drops the names of the late Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield and Sen. Jesse Helms, who is also dead, people little known to current generations. One of his common lines, after taking the stage to applause, is to paraphrase the advice of Adlai Stevenson, the Democrats’ presidential nominee in 1952 and 1956: ‘Flattery is fine. As long as you don’t inhale.’” WSJ
Good Wednesday morning.
THE POLITICS OF OUR TIME -- JOHN BRESNAHAN (@brespolitico): “7 House Republicans voted against naming a post office for the late Rep. Louise Slaughter (D-N.Y.), who died in office last year after 31 years in Congress: Flores, Grothman, Harris, Massie, Rice (SC), Rouzer, and Roy. Repeat -- they voted against naming a post office after her.”

TRUMP DONOR PERKS -- “Donors to the Trump inaugural committee got ambassador nominations. But are they qualified?” by NBC’s Emily Siegel, Andrew Lehren, Brandy Zadrozny, Dan De Luce and Vanessa Swales: “When President Donald Trump’s pick for ambassador to the Bahamas testified before Congress to make the case for his nomination, he incorrectly stated that the island nation was part of the U.S. It is an independent country. For ambassador to the United Arab Emirates — a job so sensitive in the tense Middle East that every previous president gave it to a career diplomat — Trump picked a wealthy real estate developer with no diplomatic experience.
“The ambassador to Morocco? A well-heeled car dealer. The nominee for Iceland? While well-traveled, he had never been to that Nordic country. For Melania Trump's native country of Slovenia? The founder of an evangelical charity who frequently reposted false far-right social media posts on her Facebook page.
“None have diplomatic experience, but they share one trait: All were big donors to Trump's presidential inaugural committee, which is now under federal investigation. An NBC News review of those who donated to the Trump inauguration found at least 14 major contributors to its inaugural fund who were later nominees to become ambassadors, donating an average of slightly over $350,000 apiece.” NBC
PALACE INTRIGUE … HEATHER CAYGLE and JOHN BRESNAHAN: “Luján’s move opens up Jeffries’ path to speaker’s chair”: “Ben Ray Luján just gave Hakeem Jeffries a big gift: A clearer path to the speaker’s chair.
“Luján’s decision to jump into the New Mexico Senate race — waiving the chance to move up in House leadership — removes a potential rival for Jeffries (D-N.Y.), according to more than a dozen Democratic lawmakers and aides.
“Luján, Jeffries and Rep. Cheri Bustos (D-Ill.) are widely considered the leaders of the next generation of House Democrats. They’re the ones who will pick up the mantle from Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) and Majority Whip Jim Clyburn (D-S.C.) when the septuagenarian triumvirate eventually moves on.
“But Luján’s decision leaves Jeffries and Bustos, chairwoman of House Democrats’ campaign arm, on that tier alone. Other members are also in the mix — including Massachusetts Rep. Katherine Clark, vice chair of the caucus, and Reps. Cedric Richmond of Louisiana and Pete Aguilar of California, both senior whips under Clyburn. Yet out of all of them, Jeffries may have the inside track on becoming the next top House Democrat.” POLITICO

IMPORTANT … BURGESS EVERETT: “Coming soon: The death of the filibuster”: “The filibuster is in peril. With Republicans expected to change the Senate rules to slash debate time on President Donald Trump’s nominees this week, it will mark the third time the ‘nuclear option’ — changing Senate rules by a simple majority — has been triggered in just six years.
“Each of those unilateral moves by a Senate majority to weaken the Senate’s age-old precedents centered on nominations, leaving the legislative filibuster and its 60-vote threshold unscathed. But some senators say it’s just a matter of time before even that Senate institution is more or less wiped away by a majority tired of seeing its big ideas blocked.” POLITICO
BIG STORY … MELANIE ZANONA and JOHN BRESNAHAN: “GOP Rep. Mark Walker entangled in federal corruption probe in North Carolina”: “Republican Rep. Mark Walker has been caught up in a federal corruption probe that has rocked the North Carolina Republican Party and led to the indictment of former Rep. Robin Hayes.
“A Walker-controlled political committee received $150,000 from business owner Greg Lindberg at the same time Lindberg allegedly asked him to pressure North Carolina Insurance Commissioner Mike Causey to replace his deputy, according to criminal indictment unsealed on Tuesday.” POLITICO
TRUMP’S BORDER PLAY -- “Trump’s aides warn him border shutdown would be disastrous,” by Nancy Cook and Andrew Restuccia: “President Donald Trump’s senior economic aides are scrambling to impress upon him the potentially dire economic costs of his threat to shut down the U.S.-Mexico border, according to two people familiar with the matter.
“Both Kevin Hassett and Larry Kudlow, the president’s top economic advisers, have shared papers and data with Trump over the last 36 hours, illustrating the way economic growth could slow even if the president shut down the border for just one day — not to mention the effect on the flow of goods, raw materials and the U.S. supply chain.
“Inside the White House, officials frantically spent the day searching for ways to limit the economic impact of shuttering the border, according to two senior administration officials and one Republican close to the White House. One possibility involved closing the border to cars but allowing commercial trucks to continue to pass through. Officials stressed, however, that no final decisions have been made.” POLITICO
-- “Dems seek to put GOP on record on Trump border closure,” by Sarah Ferris and Laura Barrón-López
-- MEANWHILE … ANITA KUMAR: “As Trump rages over border, Kushner quietly plans legal immigration boost”: “Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, has been working for months on a proposal that could increase the number of low- and high-skilled workers admitted to the country annually, four people involved in the discussions told POLITICO.
“The low-profile effort to allow more legal immigrants into the U.S. cuts a stark contrast to Trump’s increasingly dramatic efforts to curb illegal immigration, an issue he speaks about daily and describes as a national crisis. But Trump himself has publicly said he also supports higher levels of legal immigration, a priority generally supported by a business community short on skilled workers.” POLITICO
SCOOP -- “Trump to Fed Chairman Powell: ‘I Guess I’m Stuck With You,’” by WSJ’s Nick Timiraos and Alex Leary: “President Trump is blaming the Federal Reserve for holding back the economy and stock market despite the central bank’s recent decision to do two things he wanted—halt rate increases and stop shrinking its asset portfolio. The president blasted the Fed and Chairman Jerome Powell at three meetings in the past week alone, telling Republican senators, supporters and staffers that if it wasn’t for the central bank’s past rate increases, economic output and stocks would be higher and the U.S. budget deficit would be rising less. …
“Mr. Trump also blamed Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin for recommending Mr. Powell for the top Fed job. ‘Mnuchin gave me this guy,’ Mr. Trump said. Mr. Trump recalled a recent phone conversation he had with Mr. Powell, this person said. ‘I guess I’m stuck with you,’ the president recalled telling Mr. Powell.” WSJ
2020 WATCH -- “Mayor Pete Buttigieg Hits L.A. to Boost Hollywood Support,” by The Hollywood Reporter’s Chris Gardner, Borys Kit and Peter Kiefer: “The rising presidential hopeful was joined by rivals Kamala Harris and Cory Booker in visiting Los Angeles in late March, appearing at everything from an HRC fundraiser and NAACP Image Awards to showbiz offices and backyard garden parties. A lot of people in Hollywood spent last week learning to pronounce Pete Buttigieg’s last name.
“The 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Ind. — and surging Democratic presidential candidate — was in town over the March 29 weekend to make the rounds with potential supporters and contributors, starting with a stop at the Beverly Hills offices of Brillstein Entertainment Partners. ...
“After Brillstein, Buttigieg headed to the home of former CAA agent Michael Kives (who now runs K5 Global) and attorney wife Lydia Kives (of the Bail Project) for a meet-and-greet with about 25 industry players (including CAA’s Richard Lovett, Untitled Entertainment's Jason Weinberg, MGM’s Jon Glickman and wife Christy Callahan, and attorney Marcy Morris) before finishing the day taping a segment on Bill Maher’s HBO show. ‘Everyone was blown away,’ a source says of that event, which the mayor attended with husband Chasten Glezman.” THR

BEYOND THE BELTWAY -- SHIA KAPOS in Chicago and STEVEN SHEPARD: “Lori Lightfoot elected as Chicago’s first black female mayor”: “Lori Lightfoot has made history on several fronts after winning Chicago’s mayoral runoff on Tuesday. She will become the city’s first black woman and its first openly gay person to hold the office when sworn in next month. The nation’s three largest cities have never elected a black woman as mayor — the other two, New York and Los Angeles, have never even had a female mayor — and none of the three cities has ever elected an openly gay person to the job.
“But Lightfoot’s election also marks a major break for Chicago, after two terms of Rahm Emanuel in the fifth floor in City Hall, and six terms of Richard M. Daley before him. She ran an outsider campaign that appeared to capitalize on Chicagoans’ frustration with corruption and self-dealing among the city’s political class.” POLITICO … Anna interviewed Lightfoot in August as part of our “Tracking the candidates” series for the Women Rule Podcast.

THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION -- “After hundreds of crashes, this Britax jogging stroller faced recall. Then Trump appointees stepped in, ” by WaPo’s Todd Frankel: “Staff members at the Consumer Product Safety Commission collected 200 consumer-submitted reports from 2012 to 2018 of spontaneous failure of the stroller wheel, which is secured to a front fork by a quick-release lever, like on a bicycle. Nearly 100 adults and children were injured, according to the commission ...
“According to a review of documents by The Washington Post and interviews with eight current and former senior agency officials, the agency’s Republican chairwoman kept Democratic commissioners in the dark about the stroller investigation and then helped end the case in court. Some spoke on the condition of anonymity because of agency rules against discussing cases.” WaPo
BREXIT UPDATE -- “Theresa May Will Reach Out to Labour in Bid to Avoid Disorderly Brexit,” by NYT’s Stephen Castle and Ellen Barry in London: “Prime Minister Theresa May on Tuesday broke with her own party, appealing to the opposition to work with her on a plan in a move that could keep Britain closely tied to the European Union after the country leaves the bloc. Mrs. May made the announcement after her cabinet had met for seven hours, amid a growing sense of crisis. With only 10 days left until Britain is due to leave the European Union, she also said she would ask leaders of the bloc for an extension.
“Parliament is deadlocked on the issue, and lawmakers are increasingly alarmed by the prospect of careering out of the bloc without an agreement. Her overture to the Labour Party could mark a turning point in Brexit … ending months of stalemate between Mrs. May and Conservative hard-liners, who have adamantly refused to support the deal she negotiated with the European Union.” NYT

Yujing Zhang, 32, approached a Secret Service agent at a checkpoint outside the Palm Beach club early Saturday afternoon and said she was a member who wanted to use the pool, court documents said. ...
“Zhang’s story changed when she got inside, agents say, telling a front desk receptionist she was there to attend the United Nations Chinese American Association event scheduled for that evening. No such event was scheduled and agents were summoned. ... Zhang carried four cellphones, a laptop computer, an external hard drive and a thumb drive containing computer malware. She did not have a swimsuit.” AP

The unlikely similarities between the far right and IS | Multicultural Meanderings,multiculturalmeanderings.com,,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://multiculturalmeanderings.com/2019/04/03/the-unlikely-similarities-between-the-far-right-and-is/,"2019/04/03 Leave a comment Another article comparing extremists: Far-right extremists in Britain have been accessing terrorism material published online by the Islamic State group, counter-terrorism experts have told the BBC.
They say neo-Nazis and other right-wing extremists have been studying methods of attack shared by jihadists with their followers on the internet.
But we should not be surprised that they do share some similarities. ‘All-consuming hatred’
Since the middle of last year, MI5, the security service, has been tasked with helping the police tackle the growing threat from British far-right extremists.
Counter-terrorism officers have been using a range of methods, including phone taps, to gather intelligence on what the most violent individuals have been planning or aspiring to do.
In some cases, arrests have been made after suspects have been caught downloading child pornography. But officials say that neo-Nazis and other extremists have also been accessing material to plan attacks published by their ideological enemies, Islamic State.
This may seem strange, but it should not come as a surprise.
Their ideologies may be diametrically opposed to each other but there are some disturbing similarities between them, some of which are obvious, others less so.
Many white supremacists and violent Islamist extremists tend to inhabit a narrow-based world dominated by an all-consuming hatred and a total intolerance of anyone’s views but their own.
For the jihadists of IS, for example, this means treating not only non-Muslims as enemies but also Shia Muslims and anyone they see as co-operating with “the non-believers”.
Using the concept of “Takfir”, jihadists will declare even their co-religionists as “unbelievers” and “apostates” and therefore in their eyes a legitimate target.
This narrow-based intolerance, coupled with gratuitous violence, has been a major factor contributing to the inability of al-Qaeda, IS and other groups to appeal to a wider swathe of Muslim populations around the world.
Likewise in the UK and the rest of Europe, far-right extremists see as enemies all those who – in their eyes – have helped enable changes that they dislike, such as allowing inward migration from Asia and Africa.
In 2011, the Norwegian extremist Anders Breivik carried out his murderous attack in Oslo, not on Muslims or immigrants, but on youth members of a party he blamed for changing the racial mix of Norway. ‘Vile material’
White supremacists rail against a multicultural society.
So too do jihadists. They refer to Muslims living in the West as being “in the grey zone” and constantly urge them not to mix with the predominant non-Muslim populations in Europe.
Both far-right extremists and jihadists see themselves as righteous purists, yet they want very different societies.
What they do share in common is an often obsessive interest in extremely graphic imagery online, much of it encrypted but some of it circulated more widely for recruitment purposes.
Counter-terrorism officers have described some of this material as so vile that staff monitoring it have had to be given counselling.
In the years immediately after the 9/11 attacks of 2001, al-Qaeda made constant use of the imagery of planes going into the Twin Towers.
IS took this a stage further, shocking the world with its gruesome videos of hostages appearing to be beheaded on camera, as well as other atrocities such as men being thrown off high buildings after being “convicted” of homosexuality.
While these had the effect of alienating mainstream Muslim populations, they simultaneously attracted to the cause young men from around the world who often had criminal, psychopathic or sadistic dispositions.
During the IS self-declared caliphate between 2014 and 2019, its practice of enslaving Yazidi girls as young as nine for sex is known to have attracted paedophilic recruits from European countries.
Whitehall officials say far-right extremists have been sharing violent, satanic and occult images and videos, sometimes using gaming and music forums to recruit new members.
The aim, they say, is partly to desensitise people for the violence they believe is inevitable in a coming clash of civilisations. Lack of cohesion
However, one area where the two groups do differ widely is in co-ordination and cohesion.
Broadly speaking, jihadists are united in wanting to see their ultra-strict version of Sharia Islamic law forcibly imposed on everyone under their rule.
But in Britain, far-right groups that have mostly splintered off from the now-banned National Action show little sign of working together.
Some aspire to what they see as racial purity, others want their own territory where only their own laws apply, while others are simply anarchists, bent on destroying “the system”."
Irritating Facts About Korea that Many in the West Would Rather Not Know,www.counterpunch.org,Joseph Essertier,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.counterpunch.org/2019/04/03/irritating-facts-about-korea-that-many-in-the-west-would-rather-not-know/,"by Joseph Essertier Photograph Source: Signal Corps Photo
A huge amount of work in the US as well as in Korea, north and south, went into laying the groundwork for a successful summit in Hanoi, Vietnam at the end of February, but Trump recklessly threw it all away, apparently following the advice of the unelected Chief Advisor and Peace-Wrecking-Ball John Bolton. Possible reasons for the collapse of the summit that have been suggested include that Trump did not prep because he is lazy, that there wasn’t enough time for Korean or American officials to prepare, that the aDemocrats got in the way, and that the meaning of the phrase “complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula” was not clear. In The Economist we read, “Mr Trump and his aides seem to have concluded that walking away will do less harm to America’s security than showering North Korea with concessions without gaining much in return.” Well, what they call “showering North Korea with concessions” is what peace-loving Americans would call “ending the War and laying the groundwork for reconciliation.”
There were various factors that contributed to the failure of the Summit, but there is one more major factor that deserves attention. That is that our country suffers from a certain kind of denialism—denialism in which people avoid the facts about our history on the Korean Peninsula. As schoolchildren and even as adults in the US we have been fed the “Disney version” of our nation’s history. (Paul Atwood explains this version of history and how it conflicts with reality in his War and Empire: The American Way of Life , 2010). In this version, there is a “collective hallucination that the US is the primary source of human progress.” We are taught about democracy and the ideal of self-determination but not about how whites and the US government systematically deprived Native Americans of their way of life. (Noam Chomsky gives shocking examples of how misinformed we are about the Native American genocide in his “ Genocide Denial with a Vengeance: Old and New Imperial Norms ,” 2010). The fact that freedom is treasured by Americans is emphasized, but we hear little about whites robbing freedom from people of African descent through slavery. We are told that people have the right to enjoy the fruits of their labor, but millions of wealth-generating American workers continue to live in dire poverty. Only by hiding gross injustices such as these, can the Disney version of US history maintain any credibility.
Without a full accounting of our past violence and an awareness of the reality that Our Country is addicted to war, it will be very difficult to build the kind of strong grassroots political will that would pressure Our Government to allow the ending of the Korean War .
“Denialism” is “when an entire segment of society, often struggling with the trauma of change, turns away from reality in favor of a more comfortable lie.” (I borrow this definition from Michael Specter, which is mentioned in the “ Firing Bullets of Data at Cozy Anti-Science ,” by Janet Maslin, New York Times , 4 November 2009). In the case of Korea, the trauma of change that Americans and others face is an end to the old Cold War in Northeast Asia and the possibility that Washington will no longer dominate the region in the future.
Breath-taking denialism surrounds US crimes against Koreans. During the Korean War, US government officials violated the principle of proportionality by ordering fire bombing raids, torture, and the destroying of dams and other civilian property in Korea. In the decades after the War, individual Americans perpetrated sexual violence in Korea. “Key leaders of Asian women’s movements,” including feminists from Okinawa, Japan, and the Philippines have documented how “U.S. military prostitution in Okinawa/Japan, South Korea, and the Philippines involve a complex ‘system’ of central and local government policies, political repression, economic inequalities and oppression of the underclass, police corruption, debt bondage of women by bar owners, in addition to pervasive sexist norms and attitudes in both the U.S. military and the respective Asian society.” (See Katharine H.S. Moon, “ Military Prostitution and the U.S. Military in Asia ,”). And sanctions sponsored by the government of the US and other countries have punished Korean civilians for the actions of their government—a violation of international law. If only people in the rich countries of the West (and Japan, too) could simply recognize and accept the facts of the wrongdoing committed against Koreans, perhaps someday we can reach a point where we, both our government and citizens, take some responsibility for the setback in peace talks in Hanoi, for the Korean War, for the separation of ten million people from their families, and for sex trafficking in Korea.
In the film “The Last Samurai,” US Army Captain Nathan Algren traumatically recalls his own participation in massacres of Native Americans and these massacres are compared to his violence against Japanese. The film is very inaccurate historically, but it is certainly productive and thought-provoking to draw such comparisons. Americans have massacred Japanese, Okinawans, and Koreans during the last century, and while the level of brutality may not reach the level of the genocide against Native American nations, there was a similar violent transgression of their rights to self-determination. Honest recognition of the wrongdoing on the part of the perpetrators is the first step towards reconciliation and peace.
Holding a Gun to the Head of Pyongyang
What a shock it must have been or will be for North Koreans when they hear that the head of state of their country was handed in Hanoi a piece of paper that called for “fully dismantling North Korea’s nuclear infrastructure, chemical and biological warfare program and related dual-use capabilities; and ballistic missiles, launchers, and associated facilities”! ( Japan Times , 31 March 2019, p. 4). Now we know that, in the end, Trump decided to go with Bolton’s “Libya model,” i.e., demanding full-on capitulation from the North Koreans.
Imagine: On the other side of the negotiating table sits the head of state of a country that has a population 13 times larger and a defense budget 150 times larger than yours, hundreds of military bases in your region from which they can strike you, portable military bases called “aircraft carriers,” one hundred times more numerous (and of course far more potent) nuclear missiles, tens of thousands of troops within a day’s drive of your southern border, and submarines equipped with thermonuclear warheads lurking at any moment who-knows-where along your long coastline. With a straight face, this man hands you a piece of paper with his ultimatum: You completely give up your nuclear deterrent as well as all your chemical and biological weapons programs—for Washington the term “denuclearization” now includes these other WMDs—while his country gets to keep all their nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons, and only they will have the right to continue to expand their stockpile of such weapons. You have to hand over your nukes with their fissile material, tell them where all your nukes are located, allow them to send inspectors into your country to study your facilities, dismantle all your nuclear facilities both old and new, and find new jobs for all your scientists and technicians who now work on nukes.
There is this assumption that North Korea must completely disarm first, even while Our leaders in Washington are in control of 6,800 nukes and have usurped the “power to dictate the odds of continued life on our planet,” in the words of Lee Butler, the former head of the US Strategic Command (STRATCOM), which controls nuclear weapons and strategy. Butler says they should be “trembling in the face of [their] folly.”
North Korea had been willing to bend over backwards for just a little sanctions relief—“relief” in the sense that prosperity will probably be short-lived and the economic suffering of North Korean workers will probably continue. Peace is to be on Washington’s terms. It is not hard to see the next step after Washington gets the peace it wants: Western (and Japanese) corporations walk in, snap up factories at bargain-basement prices, and start exploiting North Korean workers, not unlike what they did to working people in the southern part of the Peninsula after the 1997-98 Asian Financial Crisis when the IMF (International Monetary Fund) came in and “helped” South Koreans by organizing bailouts that benefited the private club of greedy multinational corporations.
Our Current Violence against Koreans
The US government is using our tax dollars to kill Koreans even now. The dominant narrative portrays Washington as a calm and gentle pussy cat, just sitting at the negotiating table waiting for North Korea to come back, while the barking wolves are Moscow, Beijing, and Pyongyang. Nothing could be further from the truth. Washington represents a pack of loud, barking wolves with fresh Korean blood dripping off their sharp fangs in anticipation of eating up the whole Korean Peninsula. On 4 September 2017 the Editorial Board of the Wall Street Journal actually openly recommended simply starving North Koreans to death in order to achieve regime change, in an article entitled “ Options for Removing Kim Jong Un ”.
Well, we may be starving them right now through our sanctions. The sanctions make it very difficult to get humanitarian aid into the country. Agencies must get special travel passports from the US State Department, as well as approvals from three other departments of the US government. Banks are loath to cooperate with the delivery of funds. There are delays in port clearances. According to Pierre Peron , a spokesperson for the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in Bangkok, “With an estimated 11 million men, women and children lacking sufficient nutritious food, clean drinking water, or access to basic health and sanitation services,” North Korea received “less than half of the $111 million that international humanitarian agencies deemed necessary” . 190,000 of those people are kindergarten children who “did not receive food assistance last year due to the shortage of funds.”
Washington’s Constant Threats
A quick run-down of our many threats against North Korea would include Trump’s threat at the U.N. to “totally destroy” their country (again); our continued development of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons; and our mass production of other dangerous conventional weapons such as tiny robots invisible to the eye that can spy on and assassinate individuals through nanotechnology. When Our Country builds more nukes and tests them one after another at places such as Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, that threatens North Korea and their allies, such as Russia. There have been at least five ICBM test launches at Vandenberg just during the last year, when rapprochement between Washington and Pyongyang was achieved. They say this is routine, but the very fact that it is routine, that our government can do this without the slightest hint of criticism from our journalists, is worrisome to say the least, and downright shameful. Among scientists there is a consensus, forming or already formed, that a full nuclear exchange between two major nuclear powers such as the US and Russia would throw up so much ash into our atmosphere that a “nuclear winter” would result, causing the extinction of our species. In that sense, further nuclear weapons development threatens everyone, including North Koreans, as well as you and me. The US must jump on the disarmament bandwagon and sign the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons ( TPNW ).
In our names, without our approval, Washington has also sparked a new cold war, this time with China. (Michael T. Klare, “ War with China? It’s Already Under Way ,”). Klare argues that Washington and Beijing already have a kind of war going—one involving a trade war, a battle over technology, cyberwarfare, and diplomatic and military coercion (such as naval patrols and new “basing arrangements with local powers—all with the aim of confining the Chinese military to areas close to the mainland”). Since China is a traditional ally of Korea, North Korea’s security is also threatened.
Recently, Our Government has threatened a respected international judicial body, the International Criminal Court (ICC). Any judge who demands accountability among US government officials for Our War in Afghanistan will be subject to visa restrictions. The ICC is a “court of last resort,” and Washington wants to remove that last-chance ability of people to seek justice. This demonstrates once again that the US is a rogue state.
“The South and North today have agreed to remove every threat in all areas of the Korean Peninsula that can cause war,” President Moon Jae-in of South Korea has said. If only that were true! In fact, President Moon’s government has not taken steps to remove Our Bases that threaten people, both north and south, who live on the Korean Peninsula, not to mention the other threats above, such as South Korea’s nuclear “umbrella.” South Koreans will still feel the rogue’s “light hold on the jugular” of their necks and still smell the stench of his breath, even if President Moon’s immediate foreign policy goals vis-à-vis the North are accomplished. (The phrase “light hold on the jugular” comes from the American historian of Korea Bruce Cumings. This is the function of Our Bases in South Korea in his estimation. Not only do they intimidate countries in the north but also the government and people of South Korea).
Conclusion
This week in the United States, April 3rd will come and go with barely a comment by Our journalists. That date in 1948 is one which will live in infamy. John R. Hodge, the military governor of the occupying army called the United States Army Military Government in Korea (USAMGIK) said in October 1947 that Jeju Island was “a truly communal area that is peacefully controlled by the People’s Committee without much Comintern influence.” Despite that dedication to democracy, or perhaps because of it, tens of thousands of the people on that island were murdered, soon after their uprising began on April 3rd. It was obvious that they would not vote the right way in the U.N.-“observed” elections—elections in which people in the north of the country were unable to participate. The USAMGIK began to ruthlessly crack down on people of a variety of political persuasions who did not approve of the concept of having two governments in Korea, one of them backed by a foreign government. The soldiers and police that were hired by Washington reminded many Koreans of the Empire of Japan that had brutally ruled them for a half century. In fact, Washington hired many of the same Korean police who had been hired by the previous empire—the same treacherous Koreans who had worked against the Korean resistance.
Our government’s responsibility is clear: “U.S. military leaders gave direct orders that initiated early Jeju 4.3 events [i.e., the massacre of agents of the “April 3 Uprising”]. This was followed by close U.S. oversight over the South Korean military and police suppression operations, including an order to kill anyone within five kilometers of the coastline. From August 1948, the U.S. military held continuous operational control over the South Korean police” and “supplied weapons, aircrafts and other resources.” (Chang Hoon Ko, “ Next Steps for 4.3 Reconciliation ”).
In those days, just after the US had emerged victorious in the Pacific War that had liberated many peoples in Northeast Asia from the Empire’s grip, and after Japanese government and laws had been liberalized by MacArthur, Washington still enjoyed a little moral legitimacy. Unlike then, nowadays Washington is Rogue State Number One, a menace to global peace and security. And contrary to what we have been indoctrinated to believe, Pyongyang has more than a little legitimacy. It is now a dynasty that has survived for seventy years. It was established by guerrillas who, especially in Manchuria, stood up against the Empire of Japan (in an era when the Empire had made non-violent resistance difficult to impossible). Pyongyang was defended by hundreds of thousands of Chinese during the next imperialist invasion, i.e., that of the United States. The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea was not a socialist paradise by any means, but in spite of constant harassment, a siege, and threats of another holocaust, it succeeded in some ways, especially in terms of social welfare programs that protected women, children, orphans, and workers. The South Koreans, for their part, have somehow managed to wrest away from Washington and Seoul a lot of democracy, perhaps today even more than we enjoy in the Land of the Free, in spite of the embrace with Washington that they are forced into. Washington dominates their military and manipulates their economy for the benefit of multinational corporations, whose stocks are held by parasitic, ridiculously wealthy people from the US and other countries.
Americans are in denial about the prospects of peace in Northeast Asia. We must recognize that the hard work has been done for us, by Koreans and other people of Northeast Asia. Everything is in place. All that is necessary now is for Washington to make some minor concessions to Pyongyang. Do we have the wherewithal to overcome Our Country’s denialism and push Washington to do the right thing?
The least we can do is reign in our government before we get ourselves caught up in more costly, senseless, wasteful violence. We have other, more important, things to do, than kill lots of innocent people and a few bad guys in faraway lands. How about working on slowing global warming and increasing the chance that our descendants will have a decent future on a livable planet? The fact that the military is far and away one of the greatest contributors to global warming should cause us to confront our self-inflicted blindness, i.e., our historical denialism. Listening to the voices of oppressed “others,” especially Koreans, will allow us to open our eyes to what we can and must do to build peace.

Stealing Democracy in an Age of Kleptocrats,www.counterpunch.org,Evaggelos Vallianatos,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.counterpunch.org/2019/04/03/stealing-democracy-in-an-age-of-kleptocrats/,"by Evaggelos Vallianatos
There’s something in me that revolts against injustice and wrong. Like the genes that transmit our genetic inheritance, there are intellectual forces – call them Metis assets from the Greek goddess of intelligence Metis — that define us as human beings no less than the biological markers of skin color, height, etc.
Metis inheritance
I received my Metis inheritance from my parents and Greek culture in both Greece and the United States. I cannot say how this transmission took place. But I can say immersing oneself in Greek thought, as I did for decades, helps to see the world with the eyes of justice, the beautiful and the good.
That is the reason I did not become a “team player” at the US Environmental Protection Agency, a prospect of higher salary and advancement. I saw the wrong embedded in the laws, regulations, and the sleazy behavior of industry lobbyists and senior EPA officials.
Billionaires undermine society and democracy
Behind this unseemly politics was money, lots of money in the billions. In my college teaching, during the first class meeting, I would ask my students a simple question. How many of you like or dislike billionaires? Are they citizens like you or their tremendous wealth makes them different, perhaps, a threat to our democracy?
My students were equally divided. About 50 percent had no trouble with billionaires. The rest expressed uneasiness with people with so much power. After all, they said, we live in a democracy, don’t we?
Yes, indeed. Do we live in a democracy? But what is a democracy?
Even in ancient Athens credited with having invented and practiced a hands-on radical democracy, the process of democracy – rule by the people — was complicated and difficult. It demanded the active and perpetual participation of thousands of citizens for the administration of justice and deciding the policies of the polis.
The Athenians had their own billionaires whom they obliged to pay for national defense and public festivals.
What do we do with our billionaires? Practically nothing, save for allowing them not to pay taxes, and continue with their kleptocratic (thieving) practices and business.
The results are catastrophic.
Billionaires accumulate even more wealth and the power that goes with it. They separate themselves from the rest of us. They employ armies of servants to keep them safe and well fed, behind impregnable castles of technology, brick and mortar. Their lobbyists have been bribing Congress and the White House for decades.
What do the bribes buy for the billionaire class? No oversight of their business, giving them free hand in pollution, monopoly in the market, control of the prices they sell their products, even if that means death for people who cannot afford those products, as it happens with drugs of the pharmaceutical industry.
The bribes also gut democracy, even the long-distance, second-hand democracy we have in the United States. Those receiving the bribes are politicians “we elect” to Congress and state legislatures. But these bribed politicians have no dignity or honor, signing on the dotted line with their paymasters. They certainly don’t serve us or democracy.
As if these hostile acts are not enough, now, in 2019, the billionaire class is using the so-called media (large TV and radio networks, and newspapers) to either raise doubts about global warming or to bamboozle Americans that climate change is a hoax. The cheerleader of this insidious propaganda is none other than president Donald Trump. In fact, the billionaires “elected” Trump to boost the petroleum monopolies and the industrial-agricultural-military complex.
Trump and his buddies somehow have exorcised rising temperatures. Like dark-age landlords, they have convinced themselves they are invulnerable to the rising climate calamities. Their skyscrapers promise fake security. As for the rest of humanity, including their children and grandchildren, don’t seem to cross the megalomania and hubris engulfing their metal brains.
Stealing democracy
In fact, the billionaires are having such a great time in America, they are building a wall of permanently annulling the democracy-like practices still surviving, like electing, from time to time, whom we like. They see the rising majorities in non-white people with alarm. So, they are stealing millions of votes all over the country.
I don’t know how billionaire kleptocracy does this in the middle of the night. But Greg Palast does. This is an extraordinary investigative reporter that does not mince words. I met him recently. He speaks of thieves at the highest levels of America, among billionaires especially. He wrote an eye-opener book, The Best Democracy Money Can Buy: A Tale of Billionaires and Ballot Bandits (Seven Stories Press, 2016).
Ted Rall translates the tales of Palast into a small comic book, The Crypt of Democracy . Then this comic book finds itself into the heart of Palast’s book, enriching the overall purpose and impact of the stories Palast relates with so much originality, excitement, integrity and anger.
Read this book. It’s well-written. It is provocative. It tells stories that should anger any American with democratic values and patriotism. It is a riveting chronicle of kleptocracy, especially vote heist. It will probably shock you.
Corruption is so thick among the rulers of America (billionaires) that they threaten to make this country worse than a banana police state. They mix the selling of religion with stealing diamonds from Congo and the petroleum of Venezuela. They bribe dictators in Asia in order to buy their petroleum at a cheap price . They are in bed with Saudi Arabia, the worst religious theocracy on Earth, the very country funding Islamic fanatics all over the world.
All American presidents that I remember paid homage to the petroleum kings of Saudi Arabia. Palast calls them dictators in bathrobes.
“The Oval Office has been the residence of craven con men, sanctimonious scoundrels, psychopathic blood worshippers, vainglorious vulgarities, rich dicks and wannabe rich dicks, fraudsters, fakers, and worse: hollow suits, scarecrows, chattering death masks, and men without meaning even to themselves,” wrote Palast.
Palast, however, uses more than rhetorical flourish. He means what he says. For example, he does not simply recommend vote reform. He denounces the billionaires. But he goes further. He uses the surgical knife to cut out the cause of kleptocracy: “ put an end to billionaires… take away their billions, ” he says. More articles by: Evaggelos Vallianatos New from"
Arctic Permafrost No Longer Freezes … Even in Winter,www.counterpunch.org,Robert Hunziker,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.counterpunch.org/2019/04/03/arctic-permafrost-no-longer-freezes-even-in-winter/,"by Robert Hunziker Photograph Source: Brocken Inaglory – CC BY-SA 3.0
Global warming is starting to hit hard like there’s no tomorrow, and at current rates of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, there may not be a tomorrow, as emissions continue setting new records year-by-year, expected to hit a 62-year record in 2019. So much for the Paris 2015 climate agreement!
The most sensitive areas to global warming, (1) the Arctic (almost all of its multi-year ice, or old ice, is gone- already melted), and (2) East Antarctica, the coldest spot in the planet… strangely melting, and (3) Siberian ground that “no longer freezes in winter” are three occurrences that should keep world leaders up late into the night, blankly staring at the ceiling.
In fact, over the past couple of decades global warming has groomed ultra-dangerous climate upheavals that could destroy sizeable swaths of civilization. But how soon remains an open question?
Moreover, there are several ecosystem flashpoints with enough potential to massively destroy large segments of life right now, which, in fact, is already happening in real time, and scientifically documented, with nearly total loss of arthropods in the tropical rain forests of Mexico and Puerto Rico as a result of excessive global warming, which can destroy populations of arthropods by inhibiting reproduction and disorienting internal organ functionality ( Climate-Driven Declines in Arthropod Abundance Restructure a Rainforest Food Web , Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences)
According to the scientists that conducted the 40-year rainforests studies in Mexico and Puerto Rico, rainforests temperatures exceeded the dreaded 2° C post-industrial guardrail (Maybe the IPCC is on to something by insisting the world must not allow temps to exceed 2° C, post-industrial).
Another ecosystem flash point of major concern is the failure of Arctic ground to freeze— even in the winter, in turn, exposing permafrost to thawing. This is unheard of, and it defies claims by many Republicans in Congress that say climate change/global warming is a hoax, or they often times fall back on the time-worn hackneyed statement: “The climate always changes.”
Albeit, failing to recognize the several ominous threats of global warming, especially now that the “ground cover protecting permafrost from thawing is not freezing in the Arctic wintertime” is comparable to applying for lifetime membership in the Flat Earth Society. After all, some things in life are so bloody obvious that denial is tantamount to imbecility or brainlessness, traits that are not DNA inclusive, rather symbolic of a deadness bordering on lunacy.
If not global warming, then what’s behind Arctic ground not freezing in the dead of winter, exposing permafrost to thaw, and East Antarctica, the world’s coldest spot, starting to melt?
In that regard, National Geographic ran a story a couple of months ago entitled: “Some Arctic Ground No Longer Freezing— Even in Winter” d/d August 20th, 2018.
Here’s a snippet: “Could a thaw of permafrost begin decades sooner than many people expect in some of the Arctic’s coldest, most carbon-rich regions, releasing trapped greenhouse gases (GHG) that could accelerate human-caused climate change?”
Ipso facto, signage needs to be posted in northern Siberia with big bold red lettering: “Caution… Area Subject to Massive Release of Greenhouse Gases and Runaway Global Warming!”
Still, smart-alecky people may query: Runaway Global Warming (RGW), so what? Answer: Check out Australia at year-end 2018 when all-time sustaining record temperatures brought the destruction of biblical proportions, melted highways, thousands of bats deathly falling in city streets, massive losses of fishes, and fruit that “cooked from the inside out.” Yes, believe it or not, cooked from the inside out! But, that’s only a sampler of what’s in store with full-scale planetary RGW. It’ll take one’s breath away… literally!
RGW is not outside the realm of possibility, according to National Geographic, there’s plenty of carbon trapped in permafrost: “Every winter across the Arctic, the top few inches or feet of soil and rich plant matter freezes up before thawing again in summer. Beneath this active layer of ground extending hundreds of feet deeper sits continuously frozen earth called permafrost, which, in places, has stayed frozen for millennia.”
But the ground cover for permafrost did not freeze-up in a region of the Arctic where temperatures typically dip to -40° F, and where permafrost has always remained frozen since time immemorial.
That same article goes on to describe some details about the discovery of ground cover for permafrost not freezing in winter: “The discovery has not been peer-reviewed or published and represents limited data from one spot in one year. But with measurements from another scientist nearby and one an ocean away appearing to support the Zimovs’ findings, some Arctic experts are weighing a troubling question: Could a thaw of permafrost begin decades sooner than many people expect in some of the Arctic’s coldest, most carbon-rich regions, releasing trapped greenhouse gases that could accelerate human-caused climate change?”
Is that how Runaway Global Warming starts? Probably!
Not only that, but throughout the Arctic, change is happening lightening fast in geological terms, e.g., 300 miles north of the Arctic Circle in Norway temperatures reached 90°F this past spring. In other words, the Arctic is cookin’.
Nearly a quarter of the Northern Hemisphere landmass sits on permafrost trapped in frozen soil that contains twice the amount of carbon that’s already in the atmosphere, which is a surefire deadly formula for trouble.
The jury is still out on the National Geographic article. Hopefully, it is not a major trend throughout the Arctic, but ominously, it’s popping up in other Arctic permafrost regions thousands of miles away.
To that point, thousands of miles from Siberia, Vladimir Romanovsky, a permafrost expert at the University of Alaska/Fairbanks found freeze-ups of permafrost shifting from mid-January to as late as March, happening since 2014.
Additionally, from National Geographic: “It’s worrisome,’ says Sue Natali, a permafrost expert, also with Woods Hole, who saw an active layer not re-freeze recently during a research trip to Alaska’s Yukon region. ‘When we see things happening that hasn’t happened in the lifetime of the scientists studying them, that should be a concern.”
The stakes in the Arctic are high. It’s common knowledge that if permafrost layers are consistently exposed to thawing, consequences can be hard, fast and not pleasant. Counter-intuitively, once it’s unfrozen, permafrost can potentially release GHG year-round, not only in summertime. And, that’s a huge problem without a solution, no solutions at all, unless well-beforehand Homo sapiens halt GHG emissions. No chance.

Neoliberals hope that what worked with the far right will work with the left. To block any progress it might make, they are trying to build a ‘wall of values’ that will make the left suspect. They hope this will force people who can no longer bear the government’s policies to put up with them, because they will deem those of its most powerful adversaries even worse.
As if by chance, the left has been accused of antisemitism simultaneously in France, the UK and the US. Once a target is selected, all one need do is find a clumsy, outrageous or contemptible opinion expressed, say on Facebook or Twitter, by a member of the political movement one intends to discredit (the UK Labour party has more than 500,000 members). Then the media take over. One can also destroy an opponent by pretending they have expressed antisemitic prejudices they do not hold — such as ‘democracy/journalism/the financial sector is controlled by Jews’ — as soon as they criticise the oligarchy, the media or a bank.
Philosopher Alain Finkielkraut recently claimed that ‘If [Jeremy] Corbyn was in Downing Street, you could say that, for the first time since Hitler, an antisemite was leader of a European country’ ( 1 ). According to President Donald Trump the situation is just as bad in the US because, with the election of a number of leftwing militants to Congress, ‘The Democrats have become an anti-Israel party. They’ve become an anti-Jewish party.’ (He later said, ‘The Democrats hate Jewish people.’) Bernard-Henri Lévy has even dared to compare French journalist and leftist National Assembly member François Ruffin to Lucien Rebatet, author of the antisemitic pamphlet Les Décombres ; to Xavier Vallat, commissioner-general for Jewish affairs in Vichy France; and to Robert Brasillach, a Nazi collaborator executed after the liberation of France. Lévy, a professional defamer, claimed to detect in Ruffin a ‘conscious or unconscious echo of the style of Gringoire ’ ( 2 ), a magazine dripping with antisemitic hatred; its most notorious smear campaign drove a minister of the interwar leftwing Front Populaire government to suicide.
Jews have been murdered by antisemites in France and the US. This tragedy is now turned into an ideological weapon used by Trump, the Israeli government and mendacious intellectuals. If we must build a cordon sanitaire, let it protect us against those who purposely accuse their adversaries of an infamy of which they know they are innocent.

Population Bomb or Bomb the Population?,www.counterpunch.org,John Steppling,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.counterpunch.org/2019/04/03/population-bomb-or-bomb-the-population/,"There will be, in the next generation or so, a pharmacological method of making people love their servitude, and producing dictatorship without tears, so to speak, producing a kind of painless concentration camp for entire societies, so that people will in fact have their liberties taken away from them, but will rather enjoy it, because they will be distracted from any desire to rebel by propaganda or brainwashing, or brainwashing enhanced by pharmacological methods. And this seems to be the final revolution”.
– Aldous Huxley, The Ultimate Revolution
Ending Militarism. Militarism in all its forms, from the prison-industrial complex to wars of occupation, is one of the most powerful obstacles to the achievement of reproductive, environmental and climate justice. Ending militarism is a point where our struggles can and should converge, where there are multiple overlaps. The list is long: Military toxins damage the environment and harm reproductive health. Militarism increases violence against women, racism and anti-immigration activities. Militarism robs resources from other social and environmental needs. War destroys ecosystems, livelihoods, and health and sanitation infrastructure. It is the biggest threatof all to sustainable social reproduction.

Eugenics was an American specialty. It inspired Hitler, and it was much studied and admired in the UK as well with support from H.G. Wells, GB Shaw, and Churchill. White supremacism is what drove colonial logic and practice and its still with us in the capitalist societies of the West, and things like mass incarceration are evidence of that. But it has also bled into other areas of study, and into the culture at large really. And one of the most pronounced expressions of the new eugenics (that claims not to be) are in the so called Population Bombers (named after Paul Erlich’s book).
But before getting to the *new* scientific racism of the Population Bombers, lets take a stroll down memory lane and visit the old scientific racism.
Since this is going to be a very truncated version of a complex and sadly extensive history, a good place to start might be Charles Benedict Davenport, the head of the American Breeders Association (ABA) which was started in Boston in 1903. And originally concerned with sweet peas, and not people. But they expanded to include a eugenics division in 1906 to, as Davenport put it… “emphasize the value of superior blood and the menace to society of inferior blood.” Membership was very prestigious. Alexander Graham Bell, and dozen presidents of major Universities, as well as scientists like Frederick Adams Woods, and Roswell H. Johnson. The legacy of Puritanism looms large here. As it does it most histories of the U.S.
Eugenics was immensely popular straight away. And while many literary types and faddists glommed onto the idea, the primary force behind Eugenics were outright racists like Woods, Davenport and Johnson. And the almost immediate trend for this discipline was toward birth control, and in particular sterilization. Now, the history of eugenics is fascinating and terrifying and I suggest reading Allan Chase’s seminal book The Legacy of Malthus, The Social Cost of New Scientific Racism . But I can only skim over some of this to lay the foundation for looking at the current Population Bombers. One item stuck me, and that was the very perfunctory training of young ladies from wealthy backgrounds who became ‘field workers’ for the new eugenics programs. In other words these young ladies after a few weeks study at Cold Spring Harbor, and Vineland, New Jersey, Training School for Feeble-minded Girls and Boys , venture forth into the cities and towns of America looking to identify signs of “criminalism, fecklessness, and those of bad blood. I mean what could go wrong, right?
There are so many trenchant details in this story, but before too long wiser scientific voices began to challenge Eugenics, and this pseudo science waned…a bit anyway. But lets just jump cut here to the Nazi death camps. That Hitler modeled his sterilization programs on those of California and that Nazi doctors were ruthlessly experimenting on children to determine their suitability or not for entry into the Reich, was enough to finally shut down talk of Eugenics, at least publically (Churchill never stopped enthusiastically defending it and he was likely far from alone in private gentlemen’s clubs, or at dinner parties.)
“The New Scientific Racism was soon to rise, like the Phoenix, from the flames which consumed the Old Scientific Racism that had lasted from Malthus to Hitler. Ironically, it was not by some new magic touchstone that the new scientific racism found the secret of eternal life, but in the basic myth that had formed the trunk on which Gobineau and Galton, Retzius and Spencer, Davenport, and Yerkes and East had added deadly new limbs after 1798. The mechanism of regeneration was, of course, the original Malthus myth, the pseudonatural “Law” that man’s ability to produce babies would always and forever be greater than his “finite” capacity to grow food. Therefore, unless the exploding human birth rates were slashed, our species faced famine and extinction. This “Law of Population” was purely a figment of Malthus’ imagination. Some seven decades before Malthus was born in 1766, the European Agricultural Revolution, “the greatest move forward in agriculture since neolithic times,” had proven—and continues to prove, abundantly, in our own times—that Malthus’ famous “Law” was a totally false description of the realities of food production and human reproduction on this planet. “
– Allan Chase, The Legacy of Malthus
The new scientific racism added pollution to the narrative. And indeed pollution was already a serious health issue. But the new population narrative simplified everything down to *People Pollute*. Period.
“As in the 1920’s, when the nation’s decent people were betrayed by their own education into accepting, as a scientific truth, the crude eugenic myth—”proven” by the civilian and Army IQ test scores—of “the decline in American intelligence,” and therefore decided to throw their support behind the anti-Italian, anti-Semitic, anti-Catholic immigration restriction demands of the old scientific racists, the contemporary effects were tragic. Some of the best-educated and best-intentioned people in our society began to wear People Pollute buttons on their lapels, and to become true believers and vigorous fellow travelers in the pseudo-environmental crusades of the new scientific racism.”
– Allan Chase (ibid)
After WW2, the re-ascension of eugenics might be seen to start with Hugh Moore…the Dixie Cup tycoon of the early 20th century. He was to become the patron and supporter of Margaret Sanger, the founder of Planned Parenthood. And with Guy Irving Burch and Elmer Pendell, authors of a very influential Human Breeding and Survival .
The shift was from earlier Eugenics rhetoric about purity of native stock was changing to one in which sterilization was a tool of enduring peace and freedom.
America has never not felt affinity with pseudo scientific justifications for racism. But lets quickly trace the various iterations of the overpopulation theme. And another watershed in the new scientific racism was William Vogt’s The Road to Survival . Vogt was openly disdainful of non-white races and enthusiastically suggested policies of mass sterilization and that any aid given to developing countries should be contingent upon forced contraception. In fact he, like Mencken, advocated paying the poor and those with prison records to be sterilized. One of Vogt’s most admiring readers was Paul Ehrlich, then a student at the University of Pennsylvania. The new drive for sterilization, for population control, was funded in large measure by Hugh Moore. He also, outside of an organizational framework, ran ads in major papers advocating for reduced population. As Chase writes…
“Under such organizational banners as the Hugh Moore Fund and the Campaign to Check the Population Explosion, the Moore crusade for some years took one- and two-page advertisements in The New York Times, the Washington Post, the Washington Star, Fortune, the Wall Street Journal, Harper’s, Saturday Review, and Time. { } A true disciple of Vogt’s, Moore looked to sexual sterilization as the ultimate solution to population problems that could not be resolved by less traumatic methods. When Moore took over the presidency of the nation’s leading sterilization society in 1964, Lader writes, the salesman-showman of population control insisted that it change its name from the prissy Human Betterment Association (née Birthright, Inc.) to the more meaningful Association for Voluntary Sterilization, Inc. Things began to happen in a big way. Moore “raised money to move the office to a midtown New York suite just off Fifth Avenue, and employed an experienced executive director and staff.”
Moore blamed new babies, unchecked copulation, for the rise in pollution from the automobile, then undergoing a giant spike in use and ownership. He carefully chose not to blame policies that nixed mass transit for urban centers, or plans for any alternative to gasoline driven travel. The popularity of Moore’s campaigns made its way to the inner circle of the Kennedy presidency, and later that of Johnson. And most significantly this neo-Malthusian sensibility (by way of Burch and Vogt) made its way to University campuses. And Paul Ehrlich, then a professor at Stanford, wrote The Population Bomb (1968). And it seemed just scientific enough, but still accessible, and it boiled down very complicated and dense political analysis into one phrase, borrowed from the Pogo comic strip… We have met the enemy and he is us . And it became the catch phrase for a movement. The enemy is us, the people. Not corporations or class exploitation, or industry or war. No, just people.
Nixon even joined in, participating in Earth Day 1970, a mere few days before the invasion of Cambodia (and during his continued brutal bombing campaign of that same country). Nixon, who called anti war protesters “bums”, and this all only weeks before the murder of four students at Kent State by the National Guard. The new Malthusian environmentalists (along with the World Health Organization) were embracing a simple construct that argued *people pollute, nothing else*. Just people, nothing more and nothing less. They were careful in their marketing to avoid the taint of the older eugenics connections, however.
“Underlying the close working relationship between America and Germany was the extensive financial support of American foundations for the establishment of eugenic research in Germany. The main support was the Rockefeller Foundation in New York. It financed the research of German racial hygienist Agnes Bluhm on heredity and alcoholism as early as 1920. Following a European tour by a Rockefeller official in December 1926, the Foundation began supporting other German eugenicists, including Herman Poll, Alfred Gorjahn, and Hans Nachtsheim. The Rockefeller Foundation played the central role in establishing and sponsoring major eugenic institutes in Germany, including the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Psychiatry and the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Anthropology, eugenics, and Human Heredity.”
– Stefan Kuhl, The Nazi Connection
“Like the original Law of Population of Malthus, the Gobineau Cult of the Nordic, and the eugenic myth of the Decline of American Intelligence, the simplistic dogmas of the new People Pollute movement addressed themselves to chimeras rather than realities. They also helped hide the real causes and biosocial effects of environmental degradation from many educated but scientifically naïve Americans. Finally, in the classic traditions of scientific racism, the snappy slogans of Zero Population Growth and other wings of the People Pollute movement succeeded in pinning the blame for environmental degradation on the backs of its primary victims-—the poor…”
– Allan Chase (ibid)
From the beginning of this post Ehrlich iteration (the one that has surfaced somewhere in the 90s) of environmentalism by way of Malthus, the imagery and focus tended toward the pastoral. The lakes and rivers, the songbirds and national parks, and not on improving the conditions of the poor crammed into those urban slums that were growing across the country. The poor were blamed, essentially, for threatening the holiday locations of the affluent classes. The poor were blamed for being, well, poor (and dirty and eating badly).
It is worth tracing the evolution that arrived at Ehrlich and the post Ehrlich thinkers. The Tragedy of the Commons , by Garrett Hardin, a prof at UCSB, became a sort of companion piece to The Population Bomb . And this California professor was clear that the human population question required a retro fit of our morality. He advocated zero population growth. Following on this came a slew of new neo Malthusian visionaries, Robert Ardrey and Dr. Shelden Reed among others. The new population control advocates all firmly placed the blame on the poor and their excessive sexuality. America has alway been Puritan and there is no way to over-emphasize that fact. Paul and William Paddock were also staunch Malthusians whose desire, as they stated, was “to make America great”. Hmmmm. All of these voices are white voices. Every single one. The discourse for depopulating the third world reads a lot like Mandingo by way of Mein Kampf.
The eugenics movement biggest success, and one that had far reaching implications, came in the person of Margaret Sanger. The infamous founder of Planned Parenthood, would serve as one of the key leaders of group of new “scientific” racists that operated under institutional cover, and under cover of altruistic motive. So to back track just a moment…
“Thus, even though it is quite true that any radical eugenic policy of controlled human breeding will be for many years politically and psychologically impossible, it will be important for UNESCO to see that the eugenic problem is examined with the greatest care, and that the public mind is informed of the issues at stake so that much is unthinkable may at least become thinkable.”
– Sir Julian Huxley, UNESCO: Its Purpose and Philosophy . 1948
Think Soylent Green.
“The most serious charge that can be brought against modern benevolence is that it encourages the perpetuation of defectives, delinquents and dependents. These are the most dangerous
elements in the world community, the most devastating curse on human progress and expression. Philanthropy is a gesture characteristic of modern business lavishing upon the unfit the profits extorted from the community at large. Looked at impartially, this compensatory generosity is in its final effect probably more dangerous, more dysgenic, more blighting than the initial practice of profiteering.”
– Margaret Sanger, The Pivot of Civilization , 1922
Like Vogt, like Hugh Moore, her patron, like Ehrlich and like Reed, Sanger was a voice for the normalising of white supremacist values and beliefs. All of these population bombers have one thing in common (besides being white) and that is a contempt, openly stated, for the poor and especially those with darker skin. Erlich was a staple on TV at the time (kind of the John Bolton of his day) and as his fame grew so his pronouncements became ever more openly racist.
Allan Chase wrote of Ehrlich….
As a moral philosopher, and as an open and blunt advocate of genocidal political policies such as the triage ploy developed by the Paddocks, Dr. Ehrlich has neither the intellectual and professional right, nor the moral authority, to speak for biology in particular and for the scientific community in general. Genocide remains genocide, whether advocated in a Munich beer hall in 1920 or in a Texas college auditorium in 1967—and neither the brown shirts of its earlier German advocates nor the graduate degrees and academic posts of its latter-day American proponents make it any less a political rather than a scholarly proposal.
So when today one hears certain dog whistle phrases….*carrying capacity*…that is pure Ehrlich. Dropping sterilization drugs into reservoirs for drinking water, or other such monstrous strategies and tactics were commonplace in the 70s. The pop bombers are mirror images of the anti communist neo cons in the Pentagon and State department. And both have most of the same goals.
And as Murray Bookchin pointed out ( The Population Myth , 2010) …
The importance of viewing demography in social terms becomes even more apparent when we ask: would the grow-or-die economy called capitalism really cease to plunder the planet even if the world’s population were reduced to a tenth of its present numbers? Would lumber companies, mining concerns, oil cartels, and agribusiness render redwood and Douglas fir forests safer for grizzly bears if — given capitalism’s need to accumulate and produce for their own sake — California’s population were reduced to one million people?
The answer to these questions is a categorical no. Vast bison herds were exerminated on the westem plains long before the plains were settled by farmers or used extensively by ranchers — indeed, when the American population barely exceeded some sixty million people. These great herds were not crowded out by human settlements, least of all by excessive population. We have yet to answer what constitutes the “carrying capacity” of the planet, just as we lack any certainty, given the present predatory economy, of what constitutes a strictly numerical balance between reduced human numbers and a given ecological area.
One of the problems today, when one tries to argue with the advocates of the Green New Deal, or with other population bombers (Chris Hedges is one, David Attenbourgh is one, and so is Bono) is that for Western whites, especially for citizens of the U.S., there is an almost uncanny pull in these draconian race purity proposals- and maybe that is the Puritan legacy, or maybe Manifest Destiny. But the U.S. has been waging war against the third world for sixty years or eighty, depending on how you count. Libya, Haiti, Iraq, Afghanistan, Iran, Rwanda, Uganda, Zaire, and on and on and on. Of course there were at least two white nations destroyed, the former Yugoslavia, and more recently Ukraine. But the drive is both anti communist AND racist. It is colonial and in part its useful to see how Israel is the perfect reflection of American values, only without as much pretense. Most US politicians would love to be able to say what Israeli politicians do. Admiration for fascism, suggestions for genocide and ethnic cleansing. Israel is the American ruling class with the mask torn off.
“Viewed from a distance of two decades later, the predictions made by many neo-Malthusians seem almost insanely ridiculous. We were warned, often in the mass media, that by the 1980s, for example, artificial islands in the oceans would be needed to accommodate the growing population densities on the continents. Our oil supplies, we were told with supreme certainty, would be completely depleted by the end of the century. Wars between starving peoples would ravage the planet, each nation seeking to plunder the hidden food stores of the others. By the late seventies, this “debate” took a welcome breather — but it has returned again in full bloom in the biological verbiage of ecology. Given the hysteria and the exaggerated “predictions” of earlier such “debates,” the tone today is a little calmer. But in some respects it is even more sinister.{ } But the most sinister feature about neo-Malthusianism is the extent to which it actively deflects us from dealing with the social origins of our ecological problems — indeed, the extent to which it places the blame for them on the victims of hunger rather than those who victimize them.”
– Murray Bookchin, The Population Myth , 2010
Even back in the early years of the Ehrlich cult, some saw the warning signs.
“We “are going to have to adopt some very tough foreign policy positions,” Ehrlich explains, and limiting our own families will let us do that “from a psychologically strong position … We must use our political power to push other countries into programs which combine agricultural development and population control.” Exactly what kind of power, or whether we would use it globally, or simply in countries which food shipments and “green revolutions” might save from starvation, is unclear. But he hints at a time when we might put temporary sterilants in food and water, while some of his more adventurous colleagues, no doubt impressed by pinpoint bombing in Southeast Asia, would spray whole populations from the air. If we’re so willing to napalm peasants to protect them from Communists, we could quite easily use a little sterilant spray to protect them from themselves.”
– Steven Weissman, Ramparts , 1970
Ian Angus, the sanest voice on this topic I think….wrote several years back ( Return of the Population Bombers, Climate & Capitalism, July 2012)…
“Populationist ideas are gaining traction in the environmental movement. A growing number of sincere activists are once again buying into the idea that overpopulation is destroying the earth, and that what’s needed is a radical reduction in birth rates.
Most populationists say they want voluntary birth control programs, but a growing number are calling for compulsory measures. In his best-selling book The World Without Us, liberal journalist Alan Weisman says the only way to save the Earth is to “Limit every human female on Earth capable of bearing children to one.”
Another prominent liberal writer, Chris Hedges, writes, “All efforts to staunch the effects of climate change are not going to work if we do not practice vigorous population control.”
In the recent book Deep Green Resistance, Derrick Jensen and his co-writers argue for direct action by small groups, aimed at destroying industry and agriculture and reducing the world’s human population by 90% or more.
And the famous British naturalist Sir David Attenborough’s tells us that “All environmental problems become harder, and ultimately impossible, to solve with ever more people.”
Attenborough is a patron of Optimum Population Trust, also known as Population Matters, an influential British group that uses environmental arguments to lobby for stopping immigration.”
This reasoning is so simplistic, so duplicitous and inane that one is hard pressed to know how to answer it. I mean population is not this thing, like water filling a tub. Thats first off. Second, fertility is dropping drastically and sperm counts for men, in the advanced nations of the West, is in free fall. Bookchin noted, perceptively, that there has been a shift in tone from the traditional Ehrlich era neo-Malthusians, to a new age Voodoo ecology in which the writing is acutely metaphorical…man as a cancer on the planet…or, *Gaia* etc. And this is a perceptive observation. My experience with trying to debate the subject of *overpopulation* {sic} is that I am met with a nearly religious or quasi mystical tone, one that Bookchin labled *eco theism*. And this is worth pondering. One of the reasons Zombie films (and all post apocalyptic narratives, really) are so popular and durable is that the audience WANTS the destruction of EVERYTHING. They harbor fantasy stories of starting over. Reconstruction dramas set in a sci fi style code — though tellingly none of them seem to ever seriously deal with sanitation. And clean water seems amazingly easy to find in these films and novels.
“The road to survival, therefore, does not lie in the neo-Malthusian prescriptions to eliminate surplus people, nor in birth control, but in the effort to make everybody on the face of the earth productive. Hunger and misery are not caused by the presence of too many people in the world, but rather by having few to produce and many to feed. The neo-Malthusian doctrine of a dehumanized economy, which preaches that the weak and the sick should be left to die, which would help the starving to die more quickly, and which even goes to the extreme of suggesting that medical and sanitary resources should not be made available to the more miserable populations – such policies merely reflect the mean and egotistical sentiments of people living well, terrified by the disquieting presence of those who are living badly.”
– Josue de Castro, The Geography of Hunger
There is also, alongside the racism, a decidedly misogynist element in population bombers of the current incarnation. One of the curious aspects of the arguments I have had on this topic is the oddly faux mystical defeatism of the bombers. They are awfully sanguine about their coming extinction. I have heard in every debate something along the lines of ‘well, capitalism isn’t going away any time soon’ or ‘we can’t wait around for your revolution’. Not only is this curiously passive and accepting of doom, but it’s also dishonest. People are lying to themselves on some level, though honestly its often hard to know the parameters of this dishonesty.But however that works, the new Population Bombers are providing a humanitarian justification for, what Weissman called, the old game of empire.
“Not only is the individual woman responsible for her own children’s emissions, but for her genetic offspring’s emissions far into the future! Missing from the equation is any notion that people are capable of effecting positive social and environmental change, and that the next generation could make the transition out of fossil fuels. It also places the onus on the individual, obscuring the role of capitalist systems of production, distribution and consumption in causing global warming.”
– Betsy Hartmann and Elizabeth Barajas-Román, The Population Bomb is Back With a Global Warming Twist
Social reproduction is crucial to understanding who gets to be healthy, who sick, who has access to water and who doesn’t. Numbers tell one none of that. But remember, the murder of activist and conservationist Berta Caceres, in Honduras, can be laid directly at the feet of loyal Democratic Party icon Hillary Clinton. And this is the same Democratic party that is trying to sell the New Green Deal.
Now, back in 1952 John D. Rockefeller organized a meeting of leading academics, public health experts, Planned Parenthood leaders, social scientists and demographers. At the end of three days or so there emerged a new organization dedicated to population issues (and sterilization!) — but the entire story is very much worth reading.. here.
It is important because to really understand the role of western Capital in the developing world, you have to dig into what the World Bank is doing, and where the Rockefeller’s put their money and focus. And where the western based NGOs choose to focus their energy.
Let me Quote: Weissman…
“With support in the White House and agreement among their friends (the trustworthy American managers in the international agencies), everything seems to favor the new interventionism of the big business internationalists. Everything, that is, except a new-found popular preference for non-intervention, or even isolation. But if overpopulation per se becomes the new scapegoat for the world’s ills, the current hesitations about intervention will fall away. Soon everyone, from the revolting taxpayer who wants to sterilize the Panther-ridden ghettos to the foreign aid addict, will line up behind the World Bank and the UN and join the great international crusade to control the world’s population. Let empire save the earth.”
Betsy Hartman and Elizabeth Barajas-Román (ibid) noted that ” Overconsumption by the rich has far more to do with global warming than the population growth of the poor. The few countries in the world where population growth rates remain high, such as those in sub-Saharan Africa, have among the lowest carbon emissions per capita on the planet.”
And there are many other serious scientists that have called into question the Population Bombers logic…Fred Pearce is one here and a shorter overview of militarism and the environment.
And this interview with Betsy Hartman is very important.
There is an unfortunate attraction in the reductive neo Malthusianism of Ehrlich and his progeny. Even people I would never have suspected of being drawn into the new scientific racism of the population bombers seem unable or unwilling to examine the bigger picture, the role of Western capital, not just in terms of militarism, but also in the rather obvious strategies to depopulate certain demographics and to colonize resources. As I’ve said before, impartial expert is an oxymoron. One reads all manner of extreme predictions, most drawn in almost cartoon fashion but couched in this new grammar of eco-science. Or, more usually junk science. The legacy of eugenics is vastly under-appreciated and rendered opaque. Anywhere the US financial elite are sticking their fingers is a place where one might not want to lend support. And the same for this new eco-theism, one that ridicules any objection to their findings and beliefs. The real hubris in this topic resides on the side of the bombers. Questioning the new orthodoxy is anathema. And these tendencies are directly aligned with the new (ish) growing global fascism. The environmental problems are dire, but I worry far more about having to live life in an internment camp operated altruistically by the World Bank or Pentagon.

Social Media Regulation: Speak of the Devil and in Walks Zuck,www.counterpunch.org,Thomas Knapp,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.counterpunch.org/2019/04/03/social-media-regulation-speak-of-the-devil-and-in-walks-zuck/,"In a recent column on the mating dance between Big Government and Big Tech, I noted that “Big Tech wants to be regulated by Big Governments because regulation makes it more difficult and expensive for new competitors to enter the market.”
Two days after I hit “publish” on that column, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg called for government regulation of social media in a Washington Post op-ed.
Zuckerberg offers expansive arguments for regulating four areas of social media content, but those arguments are specious. My own claim as to his real reasons leers visibly over the shoulder of each argument he makes.
Zuckerberg’s first proposed regulatory area is “harmful content.” “Regulation,” he writes, “could set baselines for what’s prohibited and require companies to build systems for keeping harmful content to a bare minimum.”
Who’s best equipped to build such systems? Facebook, with assets of nearly $100 billion and annual revenues of $56 billion? Or a new site started by some middle class guy (or even an affluent Harvard student like Mark Zuckerberg 15 years ago) with a great idea and some spare time?
The second regulatory area is “protecting elections.” Zuckerberg: “Our systems would be more effective if regulation created common standards for verifying political actors. … We believe legislation should be updated to reflect the reality of the threats and set standards for the whole industry.”
Facebook, of course, has already invested billions in developing technology to identify users and advertisers and connect the two types of parties — all in-house. Most startups don’t have the money to develop their own such systems. They hook into a third party advertising service or a standardized ad sales plug-in. The effect — and the intent — of those “updates” would be to protect Facebook from those startups (and the American political establishment from its own would-be competitors).
“Third, effective privacy and data protection needs a globally harmonized framework. … it should establish a way to hold companies such as Facebook accountable by imposing sanctions when we make mistakes.”
Facebook can easily accommodate “sanctions” that would kill most potential competitors. It already has big bucks in the bank (unlike a new company that may be years away from turning a profit), and that “globally harmonized framework” will almost certainly be built around its own standards and practices.
Finally, “data portability. If you share data with one service, you should be able to move it to another.” What will the “standard data transfer format” Zuckerberg calls for look like? Existing formats for handling user data. Who handles the most user data now? You know who. New competitors will be forced to build systems like Facebook’s, and forbidden to try their own, possibly better, user data handling schemes.
The Internet’s potential is encapsulated in the expropriated Maoism “let a hundred flowers blossom.” Zuckerberg agrees, but only if each of those hundred flowers is cloned from a geranium grown in his proprietary nursery.
Regulation, not competition, is where monopolies come from. Facebook isn’t a monopoly yet, but Zuckerberg clearly wants to make it one.

The Greatest Projects I Never Made,www.counterpunch.org,Ted Rall,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.counterpunch.org/2019/04/03/the-greatest-projects-i-never-made/,"Two weeks ago I discussed some of the projects and jobs that, for whatever reason, I never got to do during my career as a cartoonist and writer. The stuff we don’t do, I wrote, defines as much as what we do. This week: my weird stuff that never came together.
Hugh Hefner died in 2017. I was un-sad.
Un-sad is not happiness. It’s feeling neutral when you’re supposed to be unhappy. Hef, who as a young man wanted to be a cartoonist , had bad taste in cartoons and architecture but superb taste in art directors. In the 1990s his charismatic cartoon editor Michelle Urry recruited me to help modernize Playboy ’s graphics, whose content and aesthetics were stuck in the 1960s the way The New Yorker looks like it’s still the 1920s. Under Urry’s tutelage I drew scores of sex-themed cartoons with a left-wing social and political bent. I think they were some of the funniest stuff I’ve ever done.
“I love them but Hef hates them,” Michelle told me. “He wants to leave everything the same.” So no commie sex comix. Sadly for real, Urry died prematurely .
One of my oddest aborted projects was a comic strip in which I partnered with another cartoonist to whom I will grant anonymity. Conceived over planter’s punches at a defunct Village bar called the Dew Drop Inn and marketed to alternative and underground newspapers under a pseudonym, “Lil’ Adolf and His Friend Eva” featured the antics of two kids in an American high school facing situations à la Archie and Jughead (drawn a bit like that) with a twist: neither knows they’re clones of a certain German Chancellor and his girlfriend Eva Braun. Faced with a dilemma—homework, bullying, getting picked last in gym class—the pair inevitably resorts to violence. I often decry newspaper editors as a band of boring middlebrow risk-averse Babbitts but in this case I applaud their discretion. Not one paper expressed interest in “Lil’ Adolf.” I am grateful.
My UPN fiasco left a few scars. In 1998 or 1999 Dean Valentine , head of the now-forgotten TV network that aired the “Dilbert” TV show, asked me to develop an animated series to follow “Dilbert” at 8:30 pm. Valentine had seen my cartoons in the Los Angeles Times . While the lawyers hashed out the deal I toiled over plots and character designs. The result would be a show called “Boomerang.”
Whereas “The Simpsons” is about a nuclear family in the suburbs, “Boomerang” would concern a postmodern extended tangled yarnball of relationships between half/stepsiblings and their LGBTQA partners and adopted children and pets living in a sprawling dilapidated Victorian hulk in Newark reflective of America’s splintering socioeconomic infrastructure. Very Gen X.
Six months or so into it, the deal was finalized. I signed a stack of contracts. My lawyer shoved them into a FedEx. And we never heard from UPN again. We called and called…no reply.
Ghosted by a corporation! Now it’s standard business practice. Twenty years ago, though, neither me nor my attorney had ever heard of such a thing. We could have sued for breach of (half-signed?) contract and perhaps won. But I wanted to do another show someday and didn’t want to get blackballed by Hollywood companies.
Two of my TV show pitches attracted high-level interest in Tinseltown, though not as close to those execution copies of contacts at UPN. Aside from the glory, I would have wanted to watch them. That’s my test for cartoons, books, podcasts, whatever I make. If I were a fan, would I want to consume it myself?
“Green”’s premise was simple: if the planet is in danger, if ecocidal maniacs are causing climate change, mass extinctions and possibly the end of the human race , isn’t the right thing to do to murder the bastards? “Green” the series would have been about a “deep green” terrorist organization—think Earth First! meets the Weather Underground if WU had had more members—and a FBI counterterrorist taskforce assigned to find and stop them. I saw it as a political, existential HBO-type show starring brilliant, troubled lead characters.
I scored repeat pitch meetings with Hollywood production companies and a few networks. But interest waned. Calls were no longer returned.
Shortly after the 2000 election I shopped a treatment for “The Bushies,” an animated series about the then-First Family in which all the characters were secretly different than their public personas. In “The Bushies” George W. Bush was a brilliant, soulful intellectual. Cheney was a mushy crybaby. The Bush twins were nefarious serial killers. Like many other L.A. dreams, “The Bushies” died in a major network’s “business affairs” department because some idiot lawyer worried about libel suits.
The Bushies were public figures, as public as could be. This was classic political satire, immune from litigation assuming a Bush was dumb enough to sue. Most countries (France, Germany, England, Russia) had similar comedies mocking their leaders. As usual, the in-house attorney won. Trey Parker and Matt Stone moved quickly with their “That’s My Bush!” for Comedy Central. It was not one of their finer resume entries.
Later in the decade I tried to jumpstart a political animation career with five-minute shorts. I drew and wrote; David Essman animated. We did 35 of them in all . Some still hold up, all are worth watching (the Tea Party one is great), but despite my aggressive marketing campaign I couldn’t sell them to anyone. It’s sad: static political cartooning is dead, Internet companies are obsessed with video but no one wants animated cartoons. My political cartoonist colleagues have had similar lousy results.
One of my most ambitious projects got killed by 9/11.
Less than an hour before the first plane hit the World Trade Center, my train left New York’s Penn Station for Philadelphia. By the time me and my business partner, now a magazine editor, arrived in Philly the Parks Police were shutting down the Liberty Bell. (My first post-9/11 joke: “don’t worry, it’s already broken.”)
We were in Philly to close a $1.5 million deal with a Pennsylvania media investor in Brooklyn Weekly , the alt weekly newspaper we wanted to launch in the borough. At the time Brooklyn still being hipsterized. The 19 hijackers messed it up. As we watched the events on TV the moneyman leaned back into his seat. “Deal’s off,” he announced as he wrote off the nation’s biggest city. “No one will ever do business in New York again.”
“With all due respect,” I replied with nothing-to-lose bravado, “that’s the stupidest thing I’ve ever heard. They still do business in Hiroshima .”
Osama bin Laden may have done me a favor. Craigslist destroyed the classified ads business that were the basis of the alt-weekly profit model. The dot-com crash pushed the economy into a slump that lasted the rest of the decade . Brooklyn Weekly might been doomed.
Or maybe not. Brooklyn is different. I could easily see a weekly with a strong political and cultural point of view succeeding now.

A Rare Win for Water Quality,www.counterpunch.org,George Ochenski,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.counterpunch.org/2019/04/03/a-rare-win-for-water-quality/,"Run-off pipe at a paper mill. Photo: Jeffrey St. Clair.
Montana’s environment isn’t getting much help from the legislature, but thanks to a lawsuit filed by the Upper Missouri Waterkeeper group, the state is going to have to re-do its 20 year variance on acceptable discharge levels for the nutrients/pollutants nitrogen and phosphorus. Make no mistake, this is a definite win for Montana’s water quality at a time when our rivers and lakes are showing clear signs of stress from too many nutrients.
The lawsuit stems from a 2015 decision by the Montana Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) and accepted by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to set “base” levels for nitrogen and phosphorus to comply with the federal Clean Water Act. The primary point source for the nutrients is from wastewater treatment plants that discharge to state waters.
The problem, according to DEQ, is that it will require significant investment to upgrade treatment technologies to meet the new standards. Consequently, citing the economic impact required to achieve sufficient pollutant reductions, DEQ decided to let dischargers have up to 20 years to meet the more stringent base levels.
The problem, according to Waterkeepers, is that equates to potentially no progress on controlling the pollutants until the deadline is reached. Moreover, as we have seen far too many times in a number of other pollution issues, the deadline would likely be extended.
Ironically, the ruling comes hard on the heels of a recent article on the problems being experienced on our rivers and lakes from algae blooms, some of which are so toxic they can be lethal for humans, pets and livestock. Certainly anyone who has fished the world famous stretch of the Missouri River from Wolf Creek on down can readily attest to the vast amounts of aquatic weeds floating in the river in summer. These weeds grow profusely when fertilized — which is exactly what nitrogen and phosphorus do when dumped in water bodies.
Likewise, blue-green algae warnings were posted at a number of lakes last summer warning swimmers, anglers and campers to stay out of the water and keep their pets from drinking it. That’s pretty serious when you consider Montana is a headwaters state with its river and lake water originating in the high peaks of the Northern Rockies — and thus starts with some of the cleanest water in the nation.
While DEQ contends that reverse osmosis is the only current technology capable of meeting the new standards, the agency might want to revisit a law that’s been on the books since Ben Cohen, a visionary legislator from Whitefish, passed the local phosphorus detergent ban in the mid-80s. Cohen’s bill allows any county to implement a ban on detergents containing phosphorus, which then keeps the pollutant from entering the waste stream. The measure was passed primarily to protect Flathead Lake’s crystalline waters and has been responsible for keeping tons of phosphorus out of the lake in the decades since its implementation.
There’s absolutely no reason Montana shouldn’t have a statewide phosphorus detergent ban since there are plenty of excellent phosphorus-free detergents on the market. Until that happens, however, any county in the state can use the existing law to implement its own phosphorus detergent ban.
When you consider the amount of phosphorus entering our waterways from wastewater treatment plants and septic systems, we have a choice. The state can continue to make excuses and issue variances. Or we can take this simple, low-cost step to keep phosphorus out of the wastewater and give our world-famous rivers and lakes the protection they — and future generations — deserve.

The U.S.’ Refusal of Entry to Arnold August Is a Dangerous Precedent for All Activists,www.counterpunch.org,Alison Bodine,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.counterpunch.org/2019/04/03/the-u-s-refusal-of-entry-to-arnold-august-is-a-dangerous-precedent-for-all-activists/,"On March 16, 2019, more than 1000 activists from across the U.S. gathered in Washington, DC for the “U.S Hands Off Venezuela!” demonstration. However, Canadian journalist Arnold August was not one of them – earlier in the day he was unjustly denied entry into the United States at U.S. Customs and Immigration in the Montreal Airport.
As August explained in a video posted on social media, after asking the U.S. border officials multiple times the reason for his denial of entry, he was told that he was denied entry due to previous arrests in Canada. This was in reference to his arrests at antiwar and labour protests in the 1970’s.
However, as August also stated, the U.S. border control authorities had been aware of these arrests during his other entries into the U.S.: “Previously they have delayed my departure into the U.S., where I missed a plane but finally left, and on other occasions let me go through, but never have they stopped me.”
So, the question is – why deny him entry now? What message is the U.S. government sending to independent journalists and activists by denying Arnold August’s democratic right to express his political views in support of the sovereignty of Venezuela at a peaceful demonstration?
Since the U.S./NATO invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, the government of the U.S. has carried out continuous wars and occupations in parts of the Middle East and North Africa. In tandem with these wars abroad there has also been a concerning increase in the political targeting of journalists and activists in order to quell opposition to war and suppress voices of dissent. Subsequently, the U.S. border, where people crossing are already stripped of many fundamental human and democratic rights, has become an increasingly threatening and brutal place.
Today, the U.S. government is at war with Venezuela. In the last two months, they have escalated their illegal efforts to overthrow the democratically elected government of President Nicolás Maduro. This has included an attempted coup d’état led by U.S. sponsored Venezuelan legislator, Juan Guaidó. This coup attempt has been defeated in Venezuela by a committed network of community-based organizations, the armed forces, and hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans who have been demonstrating in the streets against any illegal foreign intervention. Also, the dangerous provocations and news manipulations at Venezuela’s borders with Colombia and Brazil in the name of so-called humanitarian aid has not been successful. Together with the European Union, Canada, Switzerland, and Panama, the U.S. government has imposed crippling economic sanctions against the people of Venezuela.
It is no coincidence that August was refused entry into the United States while on his way to attend a protest demanding an end to U.S. war on Venezuela. The U.S. government is actively attempting to limit the reach of his dissenting voice, and send a signal to other like-minded people, that they too might be targeted. As August explained in an interview for this article, “I guess they didn’t like what I was doing with regards to Venezuela within the United States of America.”
Along with many other independent journalists, August has been advocating for an end to the U.S. war on Venezuela and exposing the misinformation and manipulations of the U.S. government and mainstream media pundits about Venezuela and President Maduro. His opposition to both the U.S. and Canadian policy of sanctions and aggression against this South American nation has been well publicized.
The red flag really goes up when you examine similar cases of U.S. and Canadian border officials politically targeting activists and journalists. There is a clear pattern of government attacks on fundamental human and democratic rights of people crossing borders to exercise their freedom of speech and assembly, as well as their right to dissent. These abuses have ranged from well-known political activists being harassed and “banned” at the border, to the denial of entry to groups of people to attend a peaceful protest or conference.
In fact, when I heard that Arnold August was stopped from entering the border, I immediately recalled my own two-year ban from Canada, which was imposed after I was politically targeted at the border in 2007 and questioned about my antiwar and social justice work.
Back in 2007, within a few months of my banning, Medea Benjamin and former United States Army Colonel Ann Wright, leading U.S. peace activists and organizers with Code Pink, were also targeted and denied entry into Canada. As Ann Wright explained in Common Dreams, “I had been denied entry to Canada twice in 2007 and Medea had been denied once in 2007. Canadian immigration told us that we were ineligible to enter Canada because of our arrests (not convictions, just arrests) for peaceful, non-violent protest Washington, DC in front of the White House and the US Congress; in New York at the US mission to the United Nations and the United Nations itself; in Crawford, Texas; and San Francisco, California.” Targeting them for exclusion set a dangerous precedent for the harassment of political activists, and people with dissenting views, on both sides of the U.S./Canada border.
Another notable case is that of Ilija Trojanow, a Bulgarian–German writer who was denied entry into the United States, without being given any reason. He is well-known for his writing in opposition to the National Security Administration (NSA). Trojanow was on his way to attend an academic conference. There is also recent precedent even for the targeting of people who are not well-known for their political views. For example, in 2017 there were multiple news stories about people being turned away from entering the United States from Canada while on route to the Women’s March for “planning to attend a ‘potentially violent rally’,” as reported in the Independent .
Since then, expanding cooperation between US and Canadian authorities at the US/Canada border has also been further exposed. As reported by the Guardian newspaper, in 2016, U.S. President Obama and Prime Minister Trudeau expanded an FBI “anti-terrorism” database called “Tuscan” that provides more than 680,000 names to every border guard. This is a database clothed in secrecy, and no doubt full of errors, akin to the “No Fly Lists” that the U.S. and Canada both continue to maintain.
There is also the recent case of harassment experienced by Code Pink activists Medea Benjamin and Ann Wright who were questioned at the airport by the FBI upon their return from a peace delegation to Iran. They were “greeted by FBI agents who had a whole dossier on us of what we did, which mostly they got from our own website, our blogs. But they also had a packet of information for us about the sanctions on Iran, the U.S. government policies towards Iran, the issue about registering as a foreign agent, indictment of Iranian groups to scare us away from talking to them,” as reported to Real News.
These exclusions constitute a slippery slope towards limiting our democratic rights to organize and express political views peacefully. In 2014, the New York Times reported that “A past arrest or conviction — even a public admission of illegal activity — can be grounds for inadmissibility. So can political activism or the impression that a traveler is visiting on business without obtaining a work visa.”
From the “Muslim ban” and the brutal crackdown on refugees and asylum seekers attempting to enter the United States, to continuous targeting of people at the borders due to their skin colour, religion or country of origin, both the U.S. and Canada’s borders are increasingly becoming zones free of respect for human and democratic rights or international law.
As the U.S. government ramps up its war against the people of Venezuela, our united actions across the U.S. and Canada border, such as rallies and conferences, are more important than ever before. When Arnold August was refused entry into the United States, it was an attack against the human and democratic right to express dissenting views, organize and gather in opposition to the United States sanctions and war against Venezuela, and to share reports on what is happening in Venezuela today.
When it comes to how to support Arnold August following his political targeting at the U.S. border – he had a clear response: “I would say that the most important thing is not to support me, but rather to support the Bolivarian revolution, support the cause of Venezuela’s right to self-determination.”
With regard to August’s commitment to continue supporting Venezuela against U.S. war, he said, “Of course, I will continue to write on Venezuela. In fact, I would say that I am even more determined to tell the truth about Venezuela, to support the Bolivarian revolution, to support Cuba.”
The practice by the US and Canadian governments of refusing entry of those who express dissent from official policy erodes our democratic rights both at and beyond the border. By reducing the parameters of acceptable debate, this practice of excluding other points of view poses a serious curtailment of free speech and assembly not just for activists, but for everyone engaged in debate on the most urgent issues of our day.

Unnecessary Expansions: the Australian War Memorial,www.counterpunch.org,Binoy Kampmark,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.counterpunch.org/2019/04/03/unnecessary-expansions-the-australian-war-memorial/,"War is not merely a matter of sowing death, much of it needless; it entails preserving a rationale to perpetuate it. The mistake often made about reading, consulting and listening to the harrowing tales of those who have perished in battle or those who survived them is to presume that these should not happen again. Politicians, generals and strategists are all in the game: the dead are merely a reminder that more blood must be shed. Weak, imprecise terms are thrown about by way of justification: they died so that we could be free. Forget the bungling, the bad faith, the expediency.
One ample manifestation of this distasteful indulgence is the Australian War Memorial in Canberra. This particular entity can hardly be said to be short of cash but was promised $498 million that would have gone to other starved national institutions. Half a billion is hardly a pittance, and the war memorial complex has been preparing since the announcement was made last year.
The proposal is meant to address a few points, some structural, others specific to narrative. (Wars are about stories, often distorted ones, especially when massaged by the State.) Spatial issues have become significant; Australia remains busy fighting the wars of others, and so finds itself running out of commemorative room. Officials feel that more should be made for a modern generation of fighters.
There is also push towards trendy digitisation, a pneumatic substitute that does wonders to hide rather than illuminate conflict; every site where Australians have fallen will have a display, termed Places of Pride. A focus on Australia’s more recent involvements will also be a priority. In the words of Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, “It means the Australian War Memorial will be able to display more of their collection and proudly tell the stories from recent years in Afghanistan, Iraq, the Solomon Islands and East Timor.”
For Australian War Memorial director, Brendan Nelson, Australian military deployments from the Boer War, the First and Second World Wars, the Korean conflict and Vietnam were “largely told” in crowded confines. “Yet the service of 70,000 young Australians in the Middle East Area of operations of the past two decades currently covers only two percent of available space.”
No opposition was registered by Bill Shorten’s Labour Party to this excessive splurge. Sniffing the prospects of a future government portfolio, Shadow Minister for Veterans’ Affairs Amanda Rishworth stated her party’s unconditional approval of the bloated funding proposal to the defence forces. “Whatever political arguments we have in the chambers on either side of this room, both parties are […] united in our respect for your service.”
To be sure, there have been various Australians irritated and outraged by the measure. Last month, they decided, via The Honest History website , to add their signatures to a letter signed by 83 or so, 24 of which, for what it’s worth, have received the Order of Australia. Thomas Keneally has been traditionally indignant at the proposed folly, as have other authors. But the opposition has not merely come from scribes and wordsmiths who might be accused of progressive tendencies. There is an air of protesting officialdom about many of them. Paul Barrett, former Department of Defence secretary, is a signatory, as is Brendon Kelson and Liam Hanna, former director and assistant directors of the AWM.
Nelson’s sins have been those of zeal wedded to money. He, the signatories accuse, tout “the Memorial as telling ‘our story’” yet show “excessive veneration of the Anzac story”. This denied “the richness of our history.” There was also an element of plain old vandalism about the whole matter. “His and his Council’s ambitions will destroy the Memorial’s character and entail the demolition of Anzac Hall, opened in 2001 and winner of the 2005 Sir Zelman Cowen Award for Public Architecture.”
The voices generally tread the line of fine logic. ANU history academic Frank Bongiorno is unconvinced by the heralded role a ballooning war memorial is meant to have. “The AWM is already a very large institution, and I don’t buy into a lot of the discussion about the AWM having a therapeutic role in relation to healing returned service personnel as a justification for this. The notion you have to spend a half-a-billion to play that role appropriately and functionally just doesn’t seem plausible to me.”
Of the political parties, only the Greens have offered some measure of sense, though these do take aim at the more patriotic sensibilities of the war crazed. Arms manufacturer sponsorship, for instance, should end; the Frontier Wars and the Tent Embassy should be commemorated and recognised.
While valuing the War Memorial, Senator Richard Di Natale suggested that the expansion “to showcase military hardware is deeply inappropriate, especially when our other National Institutions don’t have the funds to repair their leaky roofs.” Australia’s National Institutions, reminded former Greens Senator and leader Christine Milne, spoke of the corrosion caused by the “efficiency dividends” principle to Australia’s National Institutions. The sacred will have an endless money pot.
Selling war and its merits has been the crass way states have done so for centuries and Australia’s inflated expenditure in the name of remembering the dead exceeds that of other states by some margin. Memorials should be a reminder of loss and warning; they have become, instead, the means by which the apologetics for conflicts past, present and future can be promoted. The redirection of funds to the AWM says much about the priorities of the Morrison government, supported, as it were, by the Labor opposition: the war complex needs feeding, even as the roof of the National Gallery of Australia leaks.

Collusion Hiding in Plain Sight,www.counterpunch.org,Doug Noble,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.counterpunch.org/2019/04/03/collusion-hiding-in-plain-sight/,"Donald Trump’s suspected “collusion” with Russia in the 2016 elections has been extensively investigated. But almost nothing has been said about his, and Congress members’, open collusion with another nation, Israel, whose pervasive impact on US elections and US policy takes place in plain sight. Despite courageous critiques by Rep Omar and others, few candidates for Congress or members of Congress, including its top leaders, are willing to risk challenging US policy toward Israel or the impact of its American lobbying arm, AIPAC.
Since taking office, Trump has openly colluded with Netanyahu’s Israel. Early in his term, Trump made a unilateral decision to move the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, a holy site of both Jews and Muslims. This despite the city’s designation since 1948 as an international protectorate, only half controlled, through conquest, by Israel. Now Trump has unilaterally “recognized” Israeli sovereignty of Syria’s Golan Heights, occupied through conquest by Israel since 1967. Both of Trump’s actions support Israel in its ongoing violation of international law prohibiting any nation’s acquisition or annexation of land occupied throught conquest.
Trump also turns a blind eye to the murderous crimes against humanity that continue to be perpetrated by Israel against Palestinian civilians in Gaza. Instead he provides the money for Israel’s weapons, at $3.3 billion in foreign military financing, more than the United States provides to the rest of the world combined.
Now that’s real collusion. But who’s looking, let alone investigating?

Another Raimondo Tale
Ever since Gina Raimondo, (a republican in any other state), became governor of Rhode Island, she has unabashedly launched a political coup on our lone community college. She continues to exclude faculty from her pie-in-the-sky Rhode Island Promise free tuition escapade while simultaneously allowing hand-picked business types on her “higher education” board to use CCRI as some kind of educational experiment.
Past As Prologue
I warned all Rhode Islanders back in 2016 that CCRI was about to undergo a political takeover by a highly ambitious governor.
In late 2018 I raised the issue of the dawning of the administrative aristocracy at CCRI, even informing the state that a political coup is in full swing due to inexperienced administrators, a CPSE consisting of hand-picked commerce types rubber-stamping edicts from on high, and a governor insistent on using the “people’s” college as her very own experimental laboratory to promote her political opportunism.
Down By Law
So, we now see the culmination of the coup d’etat brought to you with this overreaching, dictatorial Article 11 in H5151presented in the budget by an overbearing governor.
Before I address a few contentious proposals from Hedge Funder-in-Chief, please allow me to remind you of CCRI’s enabling statute:
16-33.1-3. Award of degrees – Curriculum and government.
The board of governors, with the approval of the president and a committee of the faculty of the community college, shall award associate degrees, certificates, and diplomas and confer honors in the same manner as is customary in American junior colleges and community colleges. It shall also be the duty of the president and a committee of the faculty, with the approval of the board of governors, to arrange courses of study, prescribe any qualifications for the admission of students and any rules of study, exercise, discipline, and government as the president and committee may deem proper.
With that in mind, Article 11 points to the utter contempt the de-facto CCRI president has for the faculty at CCRI and for that time-tested legislative mandate.
Servant Economy 2.0
Article 11 of H5151, with Rhode Island Promise in tow, looks to legislate unilateral actions, continue and increase a taxpayer funded adventure, and totally obliterates faculty shared governance.
A daring and glaring attempt to subvert shared governance would be the governor’s high-handed declaration that colleges align degrees and certificates to workforce demand, and seeks to undermine and retrofit the CCRI mission by tethering academics to workforce development, transforming both CCRI and Rhode Island College into vocational depots.
Must be the gentrification of the “New Vocationalism”, courtesy of the ruling class.
Boola Boola!
Count’em Up
Moreover, Article 11 seeks to expand the free tuition experiment.
Has CCRI provided any raw data detailing its efficacy? And what about a full monetary accounting from CCRI for the previous millions lassoed from all of us?
Did the governor once again conveniently forget a strict income cap? Did the state get any assurances? How about a student contract to cover losses if any recipient taking free tuition in RI decides to skip town?
Did she mandate the tuition gift turns into a loan?
Nope.
Without an income cap, would the students this governor purports to help basically subsidize the wealthier families because RIP is last dollar in?
Did legislators ever get an analysis from CCRI denoting the cost of each “successful” student?
It would certainly assist the state know what percentage of low income students actually benefit from this program, no?
Is it cost of tuition or cost of college?
Is it educational or political?
Short Winter Daze
Article 11, proposed by Raimondo , audaciously seeks to legislate learning with the contentious J Term, or winter intersession. (This abbreviated session places students in a course running 3 hours a day for 12 days).
So now the executive branch wants to play landlord over curriculum AND scheduling?
If the governor gets her way it’d be another flagrant thumbing of the nose to CCRI faculty and students.
The CCRI faculty, with literally hundreds, if not thousands of years of collective higher education experience, loudly proclaimed how detrimental condensing courses would be. More importantly, expert faculty stated all developmental courses compressed into a 12 day delivery clearly does not benefit student learning.
The faculty also appealed to the media, picketed the college, and placed on record that none of those courses unilaterally imposed by CCRI administration were ever brought before Curriculum Review Committee.
As the state is aware, the one-sided action taken with J-Term by CCRI administrators led to only the second faculty vote of no confidence in CCRI history.
But who’s counting, right?
Well, obviously Raimondo is counting on you to cave to her imperial wishes of ceding plenary power to a college president and her own coterie of specially chosen “higher education” board appointees.
The same group of acolytes who ignored the 56 faculty-signed statement about the current president, and arrogantly refused to meet with faculty about their concerns.
Workforce Be With You
Finally in Article 11, you’ll read where the governor wants to continue to drive faculty autonomy toward Ethel and Lucy in the chocolate factory.
It’s actually very telling of her to attempt to instruct the legislative branch that her appointed “higher education” board will approve program reviews at each postsecondary institution where each must prioritize programs and courses of study based on the state’s workforce needs?
The colleges must also identify program expansion, consolidation, and closures based on that analysis?
Buh-bye, liberal arts.
In addition, the governor wants her hand-picked “higher education”pals to set standards for making course offerings…predictable, structured, and more flexible to meet student scheduling needs.
That’s akin to a group of business folks setting standards for the American Bar Association.
See, in the governor’s ruling class factory, she prefers to disrespect the curricula knowledge and scheduling expertise of highly educated faculty, while implementing a corporate one-size-fits-all assembly line delivery.
Like Trump, she just knows more than anyone else.
And like Trump, it’s all about customer satisfaction.
Student learning? Fahgettaboudit.
It’s easier to push students out like widgets than it is to actually educate critical thinkers who will eventually question the motives of certain politicians like her for wanting to take away their intellectual curiosity.
Is it teaching a subject or selling Raimondo Inc.?
Community or Corporate College?
What’s next, Goldman Sachs controlling all things academic?
The Bottom Line
If the R.I. legislature does not significantly edit and strike down serious chunks of Article 11 then students will forever be arduously paving a road for a job search not riding the career path toward lifelong learning.
And by dismantling faculty autonomy, and excluding the primary stakeholders, this is what’s constructed and brought before you.
All Gina Raimondo ever provides is nothing more than a controlled manipulation of regurgitated pablum. It’s really neoliberalism run amok.
Rhode Island deserves much better.
So does CCRI.
Steven F. Forleo is a concerned R.I. citizen and tenured faculty member at CCRI.

The Trump administration has found another way to undermine Environmental Protection Agency regulations and secure a win for Big Oil, according to environmental advocates.
The White House wants to dial back the standards for particulate matter (PM) — solid particles or liquid droplets in the air, which will be a financial boon for industries that benefit from weaker environmental regulations and, according to critics, would result in the death of even more people than those already at risk.
The air is dirty enough already. “Right now, in the US, under the current standards, there are 23 million Americans that live in areas that have air quality worse than the current standard,” Gretchen Goldman, the research director at the Center for Science and Democracy at the Union of Concerned Scientists, told WhoWhatWhy .
“There does seem to be evidence that there are health effects at levels below the current standard, so there’s a significant health impact on the American public.”
Long-term exposure to air pollution has been linked to premature death, according to a paper written by Goldman and data scientist Francesca Dominici. This link is consistent with what the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee (CASAC) — which advises the EPA, and is composed of PM and Ozone Review panels — has found in the past.
The current CASAC panel, however, cannot even agree that long-term exposure to particulate matter causes premature death. This lack of agreement may reflect recent changes initiated by former EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt.
On October 31, 2017, Pruitt announced new chairs for three advisory panels, including CASAC, and signed a directive banning scientists receiving EPA grants from sitting on advisory committees.
Republicans in Congress had long been trying to pass similar legislation co-sponsored by Representative Lamar Smith (R-TX), then-chair of the House Science Committee and noted climate change denier . The move has been harshly criticized by many in the scientific community.
Pruitt, Republicans, and industry-backed supporters like the American Chemistry Council, claim it will keep bias out of the EPA. But the change, critics say, tilts the advisory committees clearly in their favor by allowing scientists funded by oil, fossil fuel, and chemical companies to offer advice on regulating their industries. This is happening with CASAC.
Louis Anthony “Tony” Cox Jr., the current panel chairperson, is an expert in risk analysis and president of a private Denver consulting firm whose clients include those in the oil and chemical industries.
His new CASAC team is, according to Dr. H. Christopher Frey, former EPA CASAC chairman, inexperienced and insufficient.

“CASAC is not competent scientifically to advise the agency,” he said. “The group does not bring to the table the breadth, depth, and diversity of expertise that’s needed to propose extremely controversial, broad-ranging changes to the overall assessment.”
Notably, the current CASAC committee does not include any epidemiologists, whose studies have been key in determining the health effects caused by air pollutants.
“Every other review of every standard going back to late 1970s had a broader view of scientists than just the seven people who are allowed to be on this division,” said John Bachmann, former associate director for science/policy and new programs in the EPA Air Office
Goldman says what Cox is promoting is “manipulative causation.” While the past framework looked at studies across various fields to determine links between air pollutants and public health concerns, Goldman said, Cox will limit what studies can inform decision-making, only looking at studies that show reducing a particular pollutant will have a positive health effect.
This is inconsistent with how the scientific community determines cause-and-effect relationships.
“The proposals coming forward … are just not vetted in the scientific community,” Frey said. “They may have some merit here and there, but they’re being pushed in an application that’s completely out of context in ways that are inappropriate.”
There have been many changes to the air quality review, he said. “Everything has harmed the process, but collectively it has really gamed the whole system.”
Having those in industries that emit pollutants take part in these committees is an “inappropriate conflict of interest,” Frey said. “Regulated industries are certainly stakeholders in the review process.”
And they are not likely to acknowledge the very real health effects associated with such air pollutants.
Bachmann said a stricter analysis than the new framework Cox is promoting would “prevent thousands of premature deaths.”

EU Commissioner Gunther Oettinger Admits: Sites Need Filters To Comply With Article 13 | Techdirt,www.techdirt.com,Wed,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20190329/15501341902/eu-commissioner-gunther-oettinger-admits-sites-need-filters-to-comply-with-article-13.shtml,"from the the-lies-come-out dept Wed, Apr 3rd 2019 3:33am — Mike Masnick
EU Commissioner Gunther Oettinger -- well known for being a bit of a bigoted Luddite -- basically crafted the plan that became the EU Copyright Directive when he was the Commissioner for the ""Digital Economy"" (despite not knowing anything about it). As you may recall, for many months now, supporters of Article 13 (now Article 17) have insisted that it doesn't require filters. They would shout down anyone who pointed out that it clearly does require filters.
But now that it's passed the EU Parliament, the truth is coming out. Last week, we noted that France's culture minister admitted it required filters to comply (and that he wanted sites to start installing them as soon as possible). And now, Oettinger himself is admitting that filters are required under the Directive (translated via Google):
EU Commissioner Günther Oettinger , also does not believe that the CDU model will prevent the filters. ""I am convinced that the guideline sets relatively clear guidelines,"" says Oettinger. ""As things stand, upload filters can not be completely avoided.""
What's truly incredible about all of this is just how vehement these guys all were about how the directive didn't require filters and how much they insisted that the complaints about Article 13 were all ""disinformation"" and ""propaganda."" Now the truth is coming out. The disinformation and propaganda had been coming from those who pushed for Article 13 in the first place. It's truly incredible that they basically have started admitting this just days after the Parliament's vote."
"South Korea first to roll out 5G services, beating U.S. and China",ednews.net,,04-03-2019,2019,4,http://ednews.net/en/news/sience/361012-south-korea-first-to-roll-out-5g-services-beating-us-and-china,"1 2 3 4 5 South Korea first to roll out 5G services, beating U.S. and China A- A A+
South Korea will become the first country to commercially launch fifth-generation (5G) services on Friday as it rolls out the latest wireless technology with Samsung Electronics’ new 5G-enabled smartphone Galaxy S10.
With one of the world’s top smartphone penetration rates, South Korea is in a race with China, the United States and Japan to market 5G, hoping the technology will spur breakthrough in fields such as smart cities and autonomous cars, and drive up its economic growth that slowed to a six-year low in 2018.
“It is meaningful that South Korean telecom companies are providing services and networks meeting South Korean customers’ high standard in speed and picture quality,” Ryu Young-sang, executive vice president at the country’s top mobile carrier SK Telecom, said on Wednesday.
5G will change the landscape of the gaming industry as it allows games streamed with minimal delay to be played on smartphones, Ryu added.
The technology can offer 20-times faster data speeds than 4G long-term evolution (LTE) networks and better support for artificial intelligence and virtual reality with low latency.
Sometimes it can offer 100-times faster speeds.
South Korean carriers have spent billions on campaigns marketing 5G and, on Wednesday, SK Telecom showed off K-pop stars and an Olympic gold medalist as its first 5G customers.
SK Telecom is working with its memory-chip making affiliate SK Hynix to build a highly digitized and connected factory powered by 5G technology, Ryu said.
The operator expects about 1 million 5G customers by end-2019. It has a total of 27 million users.
Smaller rival KT Corp is set to offer cheaper plans than its LTE service, with unlimited data and 4-year installments to buy 5G devices.

President Trump spoke at the National Republican Congressional Committee's annual spring dinner on Tuesday. There, he took some credit for originating the now-iconic slogan ""Make America Great Again"" (MAGA).
“They were saying it was the greatest theme in the history of politics,” he said, wondering aloud if MAGA should morph into Keep America Great.
“How do you give that up for a new one? KAGA. KAGA. Everything’s MAGA. Even when I do a tweet -- that has kept us in business, those tweets. It's the only form of defense because the press is 94 percent against us,” he said.
He said he came up with MAGA slogan himself.
On another note, Trump told House Republicans their time in the minority is not going to last long.
Trump said: “We’re going to take back the House. We are.”
Democrats hold a 235-197 majority in the House, with three vacancies.
The Democrats found success in the November elections by attracting support from women, people of color and college-educated voters, particularly in suburban districts.
Trump said tax cuts and his work on trade deals would bolster the GOP in 2020.

If you have not already seen the recently released movie “ Unplanned ,” We encourage you to find it at a theater near you. https://www.unplannedfilm.com Unplanned is the dramatic true story of a former Planned Parenthood leader's eye-opening journey across the “Life Line.”
Abby Johnson quit her job in October 2009. That simple act became a national news story because Ms. Johnson was the director of a Planned Parenthood clinic in Texas who, after participating in an actual abortion procedure for the first time, walked down the street to join the Coalition for Life.
Unplanned is a heart-stopping personal drama of life-and-death encounters, a courtroom battle, and spiritual transformation that speaks hope and compassion into the political controversy that surrounds this issue.
As Dwight Widaman of MetroVoice News put it, Unplanned had unplanned success at the box office over the weekend. The results come even after the best efforts of some to keep movie goers from learning about it.
Twitter suspended the official account for the anti-abortion drama the day after its theatrical debut last weekend. “I think we all know why,” the movie’s account tweeted after it was reinstated. “Perhaps it’s because we are moving the needle, making a difference and changing hearts and minds.”
The film ended the weekend at number 5 behind high budget Dumbo, Us, Captain Marvel and Five Feet Apart. It actually outperformed Captain Marvel in per-theater revenue reported Mr. Widaman.
It beat How to Train Your Dragon and the newly released and highly anticipated Hotel Mumbai , which came in at number 8. These are amazing numbers considering it was playing at only one-quarter to one-half the number of theaters as the top four movies.
Unplanned earned $6.1 million dollars to become the second-best opening for a movie from PureFlix. The faith-based movie company’s top opening performer is God’s Not Dead 2 which made $7.6 million in its first weekend.
The film was the number 1 film in hundreds of markets across the nation, primarily in more conservative states.
Even the Leftwing writers at Slate admitted that the “R-rated Christian drama performed surprisingly well in its opening weekend, taking in more than $6 million and coming in fourth at the box office. The movie also received a rare A+ rating from CinemaScore, which tracks audience reactions. This suggests the movie either changed a whole lot of ‘hearts and minds,’ or that it is preaching to the choir.”
In any case, it’s a hit, said Slate.
Our friend Catharine Trauernicht saw Unplanned over the weekend and posted a lengthy review to The Bull Elephant, among her observations were these that we thought we particularly compelling: Unplanned c omplements the movie “ Gosnell, ” which was released last October. The true stories behind both films are what give them genuine power and inescapable conviction. “ Unplanned ” is a story of personal redemption, which goes beyond the protagonist Abby Johnson to envelop all who have experienced or condoned abortion. It complements the “Gosnell” movie, which exposed the particular horrors of late-term abortionist Kermit Gosnell, now serving life in prison without parole. For these two movies to emerge within five months of each other, speaks to cultural currents that are stirring.
You can read Cathy’s entire column on Unplanned through this link .
The reviewers for Focus on the Family’s PluggedIn website said of Unplanned : Every now and then, a movie comes along that's not just merely ""good."" Or merely ""must see"" water-cooler fare. I'm talking about films that are genuinely important because they force us to see something clearly that perhaps we've never really seen before. Oftentimes, these can be gritty, graphic, difficult-to-sit-through films. I'd put Schindler's List in that category. And Saving Private Ryan . And Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ . Not surprisingly, perhaps, all of those movies are rated R. They pull no punches in their detailed depiction of difficult, violent realities. I'd put Unplanned in the same category as these films in terms of the emotional wallop it packs. Like them, Unplanned forces us to look at an awful reality that we might be tempted to minimize. The film's depiction of a fetus being sucked, limb by limb, from its mother's womb cannot be unseen. But unlike so much of our culture's fascination and infatuation with gore and violence, that scene depicts something that really happens. Since 1973, an estimated 56 million abortions have been performed in the United States. Sixty million souls knit together in God's image. Sixty million souls that never drew a breath. It's a moral travesty that's incomprehensible in its scope. Unplanned is an important film because it makes us consider the moral weight of this otherwise mind-numbing statistic. Through the eyes of one woman who once believed she was doing good, we see the horror of abortion for what it truly is. "

Rendall | 4/3/2019
Fast forward in your mind to early summer and the first 2020 Democrat presidential debate (which will take place over two nights to accommodate the extraordinarily large field of anti-Trump liberal hopefuls, on June 26 th and 27 th in Miami). Here’s the scene: Anxiously awaiting their initial opportunity to put distance between themselves and the motley gaggle of fellow competitors before a national audience, Bernie Sanders, Corey Booker, Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris pace the floor rehearsing their opening lines. The words “Trump (this), Trump (that) and Trump (do you know how awful he is?)” define the parameters of their panicky practice regimens. The large assortment of Democrat no-names (Julian Castro, Pete Buttigieg, John Delaney, Tulsi Gabbard, Andrew Yang, etc….) anonymously mix with advisors and party guests, feeling no pressure to perform. They’re happy to be there, ecstatic that somehow, they finagled the rules to grab a place on stage with all these other famous political faces. Future elections, here they come! Hillary Clinton’s there too, having decided she needed to draw at least a few camera snippets while seated in the audience to keep her name in the news until she deems it the ideal moment to jump into the race as a “savior” candidate to prevent her fellow Democrats from self-imploding. Even in the excessively air-conditioned south Florida arena the 2016 loser sweats profusely, not yet recovered from another Chardonnay-induced hangover. No matter, the juice calmed her nerves… and besides, she doesn’t have to say anything, right? Ten minutes to showtime, a frantic media producer gripes, “Where’s Joe Biden?” Just then a Democrat operative turns to Nancy Pelosi (the de facto Democrat leader) and says: “What will we do when the moderators bring up a ‘creepy Uncle Joe’ question to Biden? Everyone’s been talking about this for months and it’s not like the scandal’s dying down. If they ask him about his long history of gross touching and hair sniffing it’s putting the issue front and center before everyone… but if they don’t it looks like we’re protecting him.” Pelosi: “None of it matters for the primary campaign because our voters don’t care about that sensational stuff and most of ‘em actually enjoy creepy behavior anyway. Look at the gals on The View ! Let the networks say whatever they want -- you know they’re rooting for us. If anything, it’ll boost Biden’s chances of getting the nomination. We’re happy with it!” At that moment Biden saunters in displaying his confident frontrunner-like strut he always does. Upon spotting Senator Harris he approaches from behind, places one hand on her shoulder and the other reaches around to cover her eyes. He stealthily nudges in to get a good whiff of the woman’s immaculately coifed hairdo, slowly caresses her neck and whispers loud enough for others nearby to hear, “Guess who?” “Oh, it must be YOU , creepy Uncle Joe! Glad you’re here!” Harris replies, clearly shaken. Is this an unfair depiction? Not if you’ve paid attention to the headlines of late. Valerie Richardson reported at The Washington Times , “[Former Nevada lawmaker Lucy Flores]’s accusation of unwanted touching by former Vice President Joseph R. Biden forced Democrats to revisit the #MeToo issue over the weekend as one of their own made it clear that she is unwilling to stay quiet for the good of the team... “Mr. Biden, who has yet to declare his candidacy, responded by vowing to ‘remain the strongest advocate I can be’ for women. The Biden camp posted multiple declarations of support from former female staffers and colleagues who vouched for his character. ‘In my many years on the campaign trail and in public life, I have offered countless handshakes, hugs, expressions of affection, support and comfort, and not once, never, did I believe I acted inappropriately,’ Mr. Biden said. ‘If it is suggested I did so, I will listen respectfully, but it was never my intention.’ “At the same time, the accusation raised questions about whether the 76-year-old Delaware Democrat’s physical, press-the-flesh campaign style may become a liability in the #MeToo era.” No kidding. As is common knowledge by now, Biden was reproached for inappropriately parading around au naturel in front of female Secret Service agents too . These incidents weren’t captured on video and there’s no tangible evidence other than multiple anonymous agents’ say so, but in the #MeToo age, isn’t the seriousness of the charge sufficient to merit public hysteria and politically correct condemnation? When coupled with the other accounts of creepy Uncle Joe getting a little too hands-on with women and female children, it’s enough to raise glaring red flags (unfortunately, not Soviet banners) to party leadership. At the same time the Democrat ruling elites would crawl over shattered glass on bared hands and knees to beat President Trump and hence stave off further banishment to the political wilderness for another four years. Many politicos swear Biden’s got by far the best chance to counteract Trump’s Electoral College strength (i.e. rebuild the blue wall in the rust belt states) -- so they’re willing to overlook his disgusting antics. Imagine how women feel when the guy’s in close proximity with them though… talk about sensing stink bugs crawling slowly down your back. For what it’s worth, Lucy Flores admitted to supporting Bernie Sanders in 2016 and recently attended “Beto” O’Rourke’s campaign kickoff. She’s clearly sided with the leftist contingent of the party; all’s not well in Democrat-land when you have prominent minority female Democrats throwing out lurid tales of sleaze involving Biden which other presidential candidates (like “Pocahontas” Warren) already announced they believe and he needs to answer for . And what if Biden eventually ends up with the nomination? What will his fellow Democrats say then? The backtracking will be so intense it’ll ignite a forest fire. The liberal establishment media will swear they never heard of the accusations at all. Then they’ll turn it around and find dozens of women who suddenly recall being groped by Donald Trump forty years ago. But there’s more at play here too. In addition to his groping dilemma, Biden’s past encounters also highlight his age issue at a time when the former Vice President is already being stung by claims he’s too geriatric to challenge the slightly younger but extremely vigorous Trump. If his touchy-feely affection is a product of a bygone age, doesn’t this indicate he’s too over-the-hill to be president now? If elected, what if he greets a foreign female prime minister by grabbing her shoulders and smelling her hair? Big mouth Biden’s said he would’ve physically confronted Trump over his alleged poor treatment of women… but what about his own sickening foibles? The topic could bring down Biden’s candidacy before he even throws his hat in the ring. Or maybe its impact would be more lasting. Matt Margolis wrote at PJ Media , “What the press shrugged off before they likely won’t do so again if Biden jumps into the 2020 race. Does Joe Biden want to be remembered as Barack Obama’s VP or the guy whose third attempt at a run for president was thwarted by the #MeToo movement? “As much as I would argue that being Obama’s Number Two is no badge of honor, I suspect the history books will look more fondly on that than the alternative. There’s no chance that presidential candidate Biden will get away with his past inappropriate behavior. The media will have a harder time writing it off as ‘Joe being Joe.’ Should Biden officially jump into the race, it is safe to say that other women will come forward with their stories. Is he really the guy Democrats want to face Trump in 2020? I doubt it. “Joe Biden needs to think long and hard about what to do about this election. Is it worth running for president and risking his legacy going down in flames?” Only Joe can decide. But here’s thinking the choice to run might not be as easy as it was a month ago before Lucy Flores’s name attracted national attention. Chances are Joe Biden’s inappropriate conduct won’t derail his chances in the Democrat primaries, but there’s no doubt he’d emerge as damaged goods heading into the 2020 general election. A #MeToo driven party like the Democrats would be better served by staying (far) away. "
Will Rep. Ilhan Omar Get The Rep. Steve Stockman Treatment?,www.conservativehq.com,Jeff Rendall,04-02-2019,2019,4,http://www.conservativehq.com/article/29980-will-rep-ilan-omar-get-rep-steve-stockman-treatment,"witch hunt George Rasley, CHQ Editor | 4/2/19
News has broken the Muslim Democrat Rep. Ilan Omar has been accused of converting campaign funds to personal use.
Molly Prince of the Daily Caller reports Omar is facing a probe into her campaign spending after complaints alleged that she misused contributions for personal use, according to a report published on Monday.
Ms. Prince wrote that the Minnesota Campaign Finance Board is investigating Omar after Minnesota GOP State Rep. Steve Drazkowski filed two complaints alleging she spent nearly $6,000 in campaign funds for personal use while she served in the Minnesota legislature, reported WJLA. Some of the improper expenditures include payments to Omar’s divorce attorney and spending on travel to Boston and Estonia.
“I had observed a long pattern,” Drazkowski told WJLA according to Prince’s reporting. “Representative Omar hasn’t followed the law. She’s repeatedly trampled on the laws of the state in a variety of areas, and gotten by with it.”
The campaign finance allegations come on the heels of a separate incident where the freshman congresswoman had to return $2,500 in speaking fees, according to Molly Prince’s analysis of reports from The Pioneer Press . Omar accepted payment from Normandale Community College and Inver Hills Community College in 2017, despite Minnesota House rules barring lawmakers from accepting speaking fees from entities with business at the Legislature.
The accusation against Rep. Omar bear a striking resemblance to those leveled against our old friend Rep. Steve Stockman, and that prompts us to wonder if Rep. Omar will face the same kind of “justice” meted out to Stockman.
Stockman was the subject of a three-year witch hunt that included going through Congressman Stockman’s email and text messages, breaching his attorney-client privilege, surveilling him in Washington, DC, Houston and internationally, wiretapping his phone and having the TSA detain him and copy documents when he reentered the country was only the beginning.
Once he was arrested, in a continuing effort to intimidate and wear Stockman down, he was denied the insulin necessary to treat his diabetes and subjected to a constant barrage of political intimidation, including having the media tipped-off to the sealed indictment against him.
The indictment included a laundry list on specious charges, including alleged campaign finance violations never taken-up by the Federal Elections Commission, money laundering, fraud, conspiracy, and a host of other alleged violations for which there was little evidence and practically no defense against him on the basis of coerced testimony from a former associate.
And Stockman’s FBI persecutors weren’t even subtle about the motivation for his oppression, saying (according to witnesses), “You know Lois Lerner is our former colleague,” and taunting him with comments such as, “I hate the Wall,” and “I’m from Jefferson County, my Dad was friends with Jack Brooks [the liberal Democrat Stockman defeated].”
If all of this sounds familiar it should, because those are the same heavy-handed tactics used against American citizens caught-up in the witch hunt conducted against President Trump.
Even though he will appeal his unfair conviction, today, Steve Stockman, the unyielding foe of government corruption and overreach sits in a federal prison unable to work or even help his wife Patty raise the money necessary to pay for his appeal – and that’s part of the corrupt strategy being pursued by those who want to him out of public life – spend four years harassing the target and siphoning-off his resources, so that he is unable to defend himself.
Will these same tactics be used against Rep. Ilhan Omar, an avowed anti-Semite who is also alleged to have engaged in immigration fraud, in addition to the alleged campaign finance violations that have now surfaced? Somehow, we doubt Rep. Omar, who checks all the boxes for getting celebrity justice (Muslim, African, liberal, Democrat, woman, etc.) will get the same treatment from the FBI that Rep. Stockman got.
PS - Steve Stockman is an old friend, a fellow limited government constitutional conservative, and the victim of a corrupt government vendetta. we urge you to go to the Conservative Legal Defense and Education Fund’s Patriot Defense Fund website and make your most generous donation to assist in Steve Stockman’s legal defense.

A- A A+
Russian space corporation Roscosmos is set to help S7 Group in the development of the Sea Launch project after the tragic death of the company’s co-owner Natalya Fileva, Roscosmos Director General Dmitry Rogozin told the Komsomolskaya Pravda radio station.
""I hope that the [Sea Launch] project would live on. Apparently, Roscosmos will have to be not just a partner, but a helping hand,"" he said. ""I will do so once all those mourning ceremonies are over. We will meet with [S7 Group Director General] Vladislav Filev, and I will offer him all kind of cooperation on our behalf.""
Rogozin said he ""took to heart"" the death of Fileva, who was travelling on board a private plane that crashed in Germany on Sunday evening,
""She was a tough negotiator. She came and demanded this or that thing from Roscosmos. And the project kept moving forward,"" the Roscosmos chief said.
S7 Group is the owner of the assets of the Sea Launch rocket and space compound where 36 launches (including 32 successful) were carried out by the end of May 2014. The sea compound comprises the Odyssey floating launch platform and the assembly and command vessel where rockets are assembled and control of pre-launch operations is exercised. The vessels are based in the state of California, the United States.

Racial Abuse to young Moise Kean,ednews.net,,04-03-2019,2019,4,http://ednews.net/en/news/sport/360998-racial-abuse-to-young-moise-kean,"1 2 3 4 5 Racial Abuse to young Moise Kean A- A A+
Juventus' Italian teenage forward Moise Kean suffered racist abuse from the stands during Tuesday's Serie A match at Cagliari.
The 19-year-old held his arms aloft after scoring Juve's second in the 2-0 win, seemingly in response to chants, and was subjected to further abuse.
Afterward, he wrote on Instagram: ""The best way to respond to racism.""
Boss Massimiliano Allegri and defender Leonardo Bonucci said Kean should take some of the blame for his celebration.
""He shouldn't have celebrated in that manner,"" said Allegri. ""He is a young man and he has to learn, but certain things from the crowd also shouldn't be heard.""
Italy international Bonucci - who scored the opening goal - told Sky Sport Italia: ""You celebrate goals with your team-mates. He could have done it differently.
""I think the blame is 50-50. Moise should not have done that and the Curva [fans] should not have reacted in that way.""
However, in his post-match interview, Allegri called the fans directing abuse at Kean ""idiots who do stupid things and ruin it for everyone else"" and said the authorities ""don't really want to"" tackle the problem.
""You need great intelligence to deal with these situations and should not go to provoke people. That, of course, does not mean the idiots in the crowd and the way they reacted should be justified,"" he said.
""I don't think to talk about it all the time helps. I don't think halting play helps because not everyone in the stadium did that.
""We need to use the cameras, find those who are doing it and punish them. It's very simple, identify them and not one-year ban or two, just give them a lifetime ban.
""We've got the technology, it can be done if the authorities want to. The problem is, they don't really want to.""

CNN anchor Christiane Amanpour asked former FBI director James Comey on Tuesday if the bureau should have “shut down” the “hate speech” coming from Donald Trump’s rallies during the 2016 presidential election,” prompting Comey to defend First Amendment rights.
Amanpour asked: “Of course, ‘Lock her up’ was a feature of the 2016 Trump campaign. Do you in, retrospect, wish that people like yourself, the head of the FBI, the people in charge of law and order, had shut down that language, that it was dangerous potentially, that it could have created violence, that it kind of is hate speech?""
""Lock her up"" was a chant aimed at Trump's election rival, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
“That’s not a role for government to play,"" Comey replied. ""The beauty of this country is people can say what they want, even if it’s misleading and it’s demagoguery.""
He continued: “The people should have shut it down were Republicans who understand the rule of law and the values that they claim to stand for. Shame on them, but it wasn’t a role for government to play.”

Looking over football news in Spain, where Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez have helped Barcelona to a stunning comeback at Villarreal as they battled back from 4-2 down in stoppage time to level at 4-all.
Barca jumped to a 2-nil lead, thanks to goals from Philippe Coutinho and Malcom in the opening 16 minutes. But Villarreal rallied to equalize at 2-all in the 50th minute.
The home side did not stop there. Iborra Vicente sent them ahead after 60 minutes of play, and Carlos Bacca gave them a 2-goal advantage, with 10 minutes to go.
But a red card for Villarreal defender Alvaro Jimenez in the final 4 minutes gave Barca an unlikely chance, with Messi scoring from a free kick, that was just moments before an unstoppable equalizer by Suarez.

The United States would like Turkey to remain a NATO member but without Russian-made S-400 air defense systems on its territory, the US envoy to NATO has told foreign journalists.
During a briefing ahead of the April 3-4 meeting of NATO foreign ministers in Washington, US Permanent Representative to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Ambassador Kay Bailey Hutchison, evaded a direct answer to a question whether Turkey will be excluded from NATO if it buys Russian-made missile systems.
""Turkey is a very important ally. They are an ally. They are also carrying a heavy load in our NATO missions. They too are a framework nation in Afghanistan, and they are participating in all of our missions and they have since the beginning of NATO. So we want Turkey to stay in the alliance. We want them not to have a Russian missile defense system in the middle of their country that cannot be interoperable with NATO,"" she said.
""The United States is very concerned about Turkey having our F-35s in proximity to an S-400 Russian system because there could be a transfer of information, communications, or even an interruption of that,"" the US diplomat added.

US President Donald Trump said he called Chinese President Xi Jinping a ""king"" during a state visit to Beijing in 2017 and that the Communist Party leader appeared to appreciate the remark. Speaking Tuesday at the National Republican Congressional Committee spring dinner in Washington, Trump said Xi had denied he was a king but the US leader insisted. ""He said, 'But I am not king, I am president.' I said 'No, you're president for life, and therefore you're king',"" Trump told his audience, prompting laughter.
""He said, huh. He liked that. I get along with him great.""
Trump made his visit to China in November 2017, just months before the country's rubber-stamp legislature, the National People's Congress, removed the two-term limit on the Chinese presidency in March 2018.

Head of the Czech Parliamentary Group for Friendship with Syria, Stanislav Grospic, condemned the collusion of the French and Belgian secret services with the terrorist groups and the “White Helmets” to stage a new provocative chemical attack in Idleb.
Grospic, in a statement to SANA’s correspondent in Prague on Tuesday, said that the intelligence services of these two states had previously organized such provocations in cooperation and coordination with the terrorist groups Jabhat al-Nusra and Hurras Eddin, which is totally unacceptable.
He affirmed that such collusion is the latest evidence of the real intentions of the European states, and called on others to condemn the continued cooperation with terrorist organisations and the attempts to create fake situations that work against the Syrian Government.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez A- A A+
President Donald Trump mocked freshman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez during an event with Republican lawmakers on Tuesday, telling the crowd that Democrats appear to be ""petrified of her.""
In his speech to the National Republican Congressional Committee, the campaign arm of House Republicans, Trump blasted Ocasio-Cortez's Green New Deal proposal to address climate change as ""the craziest thing."" He cautioned Republicans against continuing their ridicule of the proposal, explaining it could help them in 2020.
""I’m only afraid that we’re going to be too hard on the Green New Deal and they’re not going to do it because I want them to do it,"" Trump said. ""We don’t want to have them knock it out before we run against it, so let’s take it easy.""
Trump continued by mocking the bill, which was defeated last week in the Senate, sarcastically calling it ""a wonderful thing.""
""The Green New Deal, done by a young bartender, 29 years old,"" Trump said, referring to the New York Democrat who worked as a bartender before winning election to Congress last year. ""A young bartender, wonderful young woman.""
He continued, claiming other Democrats are afraid of Ocasio-Cortez and her progressive ideas.
""You have senators who are professionals that you guys know that have been there for a long time, white hair, everything perfect, and they’re standing behind her and they’re shaking, they’re petrified of her,"" Trump told the crowd.
He ended by telling Republican lawmakers that ""If they beat me with the Green New Deal, I deserve to lose.""
Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., unveiled the Green New Deal in February after a government report warning of the drastic consequences of climate change.

SNC-Lavalin affair: Trudeau expels 'whistleblower' MPs,ednews.net,,04-03-2019,2019,4,http://ednews.net/en/news/world/360984-snc-lavalin-affair-trudeau-expels-whistleblower-mps,"1 2 3 4 5 SNC-Lavalin affair: Trudeau expels 'whistleblower' MPs A- A A+
Canada's prime minister has kicked two MPs from his party's caucus after they accused him of meddling in a criminal case involving an influential company.
Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott had already resigned from PM Justin Trudeau's cabinet citing their concerns over the SNC-Lavalin affair.
Now they have been expelled from Mr. Trudeau's Liberal Party, months before a general election.
The SNC-Lavalin controversy has cast a shadow over Mr. Trudeau's leadership.
Andrew Scheer, the leader of the opposition Conservatives, said on Tuesday that the prime minister had betrayed justice by removing two corruption whistleblowers.
Mr. Trudeau repeatedly spoke about the breakdown of trust between Ms. Wilson-Raybould and Ms. Philpott and members of his staff.
""The trust that previously existed between these two individuals and our team has been broken,"" Mr. Trudeau told the media shortly after informing his caucus.
""If they can't honestly say they have confidence in this team… then they cannot be part of this team.""
Ms. Philpott has been vocal about her concerns with the government, and gave an interview in a national magazine last month in which she said: ""there's much more to the story that needs to be told"".
Mr. Trudeau said his decision was sparked by the revelation that Ms. Wilson-Raybould had secretly recorded a conversation she had with Canada's former top bureaucrat, which she released publicly on Friday.
Ms. Wilson-Raybould said the tapes backed up her claim that government officials inappropriately pressured her to shield SNC-Lavalin from prosecution.

Baghdad needs good ties with Tehran: Iraqi president,ednews.net,,04-03-2019,2019,4,http://ednews.net/en/news/politics/360935-baghdad-needs-good-ties-with-tehran-iraqi-president,"1 2 3 4 5 Baghdad needs good ties with Tehran: Iraqi president Having good ties with Tehran is important to Baghdad, Iraqi President Barham Salih said adding that Turkey and Iran cannot be ignored in the regional order. A- A A+
“We are a part of this region and we enjoy Islamic neighbors , like Iran and Turkey, and also boast the Arab depth that we spoke about,” the Iraqi president aid in an interview with London-based Asharq Al-Awsat broadcast on the sidelines of the Arab League Summit in Tunisia.
“Our vision stipulates that our interest lies in our relations. We need good ties with Iran. We share 1,400 kilometers with it. We also enjoy historic, social and cultural roots with it. The same goes to Turkey,” he added.
“It is in our favor to have good ties based on good neighborliness and joint interests,” Salih said.
In the interview released Tuesday, the Iraqi president rejected reports on any extraordinary influence of Iran in Iraq, saying that “During the age of social media, anyone can turn into an analyst and political expert.”
“I say that Iran is an important neighbor to us and it has helped us against oppression and ISIS. It is true that Iran has influence as does Iraq in Iran. The influence is mutual, but the decision-making power ultimately lies in Iraq and its constitutional institutions, meaning the government, parliament and judiciary,” he explained.
“No decision can be taken without taking into consideration the current reality. For example, can France take a purely French decision without taking into consideration Europe, the United States and others? We are a part of this region and our decisions must take into consideration the Arabs, Iran, Turkey and [Persian]Gulf,” Salih said.
“Iraq is part of this region and it is in our interest to enjoy good relations with Iran based on common interests,” he added.”
He also strongly rejected the idea that his country be used against neighbors.
“Iraq cannot be a platform to harm any of our neighbors. We absolutely cannot be a part of any plot to target any of our neighbors. It is not in our interest…. This is a conclusion reached after four decades. We are a part of the region. If we want to meet the demands of reconstruction, providing jobs for our youths and providing services, then we must be in complete peace with our neighbors,” he said.

Prominent Russian senator Konstantin Kosachev said it was possible that Moscow would not recognize the results of the presidential election in Ukraine, depending on how the Ukrainian government reacts to numerous reports of election irregularities.
""I do not rule out any option. But I’m absolutely sure that it is too early to speak about it now. We need to wait and see how the Ukrainian government deals with thousands of reports about irregularities, submitted after the first round. We also need to see the runoff first. Conclusions can be made only after that,"" he told the Ekho Moskvy radio station.
""I would, of course, prefer the runoff without Poroshenko. This would be a good outcome for Russia,"" he said, adding that Moscow never tried to meddle with the vote or interfere into it. ""For Russia, any Ukrainian president other than Poroshenko will be better, because we clearly understand that in case of his re-election, Ukraine would step up its anti-Russian policies.""
However, the senator added that the decision on recognizing the results of the vote will be made by Russian President Vladimir Putin on the basis of a broad political discussion involving both chambers of the Russian parliament.
In a Rossiya-24 TV channel broadcast on Sunday night, Kosachev said that Poroshenko will make the most of his administrative resources in the second round of the vote.
""I’m sure that prior the runoff, Ukraine’s vast administrative sector, which is subordinate to Poroshenko, will work at its full capacity for his benefit,"" said Kosachev Kosachev also criticized Ukraine for not organizing video surveillance at polling stations.

"Futures Jump, World Stocks Hit 6 Month High On Trade Deal Optimism",www.zerohedge.com,Tyler Durden,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2019-04-03/futures-jump-world-stocks-hit-6-month-high-trade-deal-optimism,"0 SHARES
US futures jumped and world stocks rallied to a six-month high overnight following an FT report which recapped what everyone already knows (but algos, who have a 10 millisecond memory, have forgotten), namely that the US and China have already resolved most of the easy issues standing in the way of a deal to end their long-running trade dispute but are still haggling over the difficult parts, namely how to implement and enforce the agreement.
That, coupled with some more reassuring economic data, helped S&P futures jump 14 points, fast approaching their Sept all time highs, pushed Germany’s 10-year bond yield back above zero percent, hit the dollar as the euro strengthened for the first time in seven sessions as oil neared the key $70 per barrel mark — a multi-month high — on supply concerns.
“We’re being told that we’re 90 percent of the way there which is obviously encouraging but the final 10 percent — which apparently includes the enforcement mechanism and the removal of tariffs — could take some time to iron out,” said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda in London. “Investors are happy to be patient here in the hope that the two sides get this right and put an end to a trade war that has clearly taken its toll on markets.”
And since algos quickly calculated that 10% is less than 90% and ignored the actual politics behind the calculus, they promptly activated buy programs and U.S. equity-index futures rose and the Stoxx Europe 600 index jumped, led by miners, as the latest batch of Service PMI data from Italy to Germany also helped ease some of the concern over the euro area’s growth outlook.
Europe's Stoxx 600 index rose almost 0.8% to their highest since August. German stocks rose 1 percent to its highest level since October, while in Paris, French stocks scaled a similar high.
Europe's strong session followed overnight gains in Asia where MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan climbed to a seven-month peak, buoyed by stronger-than-expected Chinese services data as China's Caixin Services PMI printed stronly in March, at 54.4 vs. Exp. 52.3 (Prev. 51.1), the highest since January 2018.
Hopes for a deal to end the trade war between the world’s two largest economies were also prompted by fresh comments from White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow that Washington expects “to make more headway” in talks this week. To be sure, analysts were giddy at the prospect of an imminent deal: “What we’re seeing is that markets have climbed a world of worry but there is progress on trade, a recession is unlikely, central banks have made nods to more dovish policy,” said Chris Bailey, European Strategist at Raymond James. “If you put that into the mix I’m not surprised risk assets have moved up.” “We are going to get a deal done in China and the U.S.,” said Luke Hickmore, senior investment manager at Aberdeen Standard Investments. “That, with the stimulus China has put in place, and a slightly calmer tone in the U.K. as well, I think is stoking a market that’s wanted to run hotter than it has done for a while.”
Not only have they moved up, but the MSCI World index is now just shy of a bull market from its December lows.
Generally strong world stocks and hopes of a softer Brexit sparked a sell-off in safe-haven government bonds, pushing yields off recent lows. U.S. 10-year Treasury yields rose almost 4 basis points to 2.52%. Germany’s benchmark 10-year German Bund yield rose back above 0, printing at 0.005%. A week ago it hit a 2-1/2 year low at around minus 0.09 percent on concern about the weak economic growth backdrop.
One fly in the Fed's ""rate hike pause"" ointment is that oil prices stood near multi-month highs amid concerns about supply. Brent crude rose to as high as $69.92 per barrel, its highest since November and near the psychologically important level of $70 per barrel . It was last up 0.6 percent at $69.80. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude rose 0.34% to $62.79 per barrel. As Reuters noted , news that the US is considering more sanctions against Iran, the fourth-largest producer of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), and the halting of production at a crude terminal in Venezuela threatened to squeeze supply and pushed oil prices up on Tuesday.
As oil prices surge, the Fed will be hard pressed to explain why it is ignoring what is arguably the biggest cause of consumer anger aimed at higher prices and instead focusing solely on boosting stock rices.
In FX, the dollar was pressured as risk sentiment improved amid fresh hope for progress in U.S.-China trade talks and better-than-expected services PMI data in all four of the euro-area’s largest economies. The euro rose as stops were triggered. Sterling extended its gains after British Prime Minister Theresa May said late on Tuesday she would seek another Brexit delay to agree an EU divorce deal with the opposition Labour Party leader, raising hopes of a “softer” Brexit. The Australian dollar led a risk-on rally, boosted by expectations for a U.S.-China trade deal; New Zealand dollar and Scandinavian currencies followed suit while the allure of traditional havens, such as Treasuries and the yen, faded.
Bitcoin, which inexplicably surged 18.7 percent on Tuesday following a major order by an anonymous buyer, extended its gains by another 1.6 percent to $4,977.48. Spot gold dipped 0.08 percent to trade at $1,291.31 per ounce.
On the macro side, data includes ADP employment change as well as Markit services and composite PMIs.

Top Overnight News from Bloomberg U.S. and China officials have resolved most of the issues surrounding the deal though they have yet to agree on what happens to existing U.S. duties on Chinese goods and the terms of an enforcement mechanism to ensure China keeps to the trade deal, Financial Times said, citing people briefed on the talks China’s Vice Premier Liu He will resume negotiations with his U.S. counterparts in Washington Wednesday as both governments push towards an agreement to end their trade dispute A woman carrying two Chinese passports illegally entered President Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, Saturday and lied to a Secret Service agent, according to court documents filed in West Palm Beach Larry Kudlow said the president stands by his choice of Stephen Moore for an open seat on the Fed Board despite recent reports about the possible nominee’s failure to fully pay taxes and alimony U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May on Tuesday abandoned her strategy of making Brexit a project of her Conservative Party and Democratic Unionists and asked Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the opposition Labour Party, to rescue her Crude advanced to the highest this year after a further reduction in supply from OPEC signaled that global markets are tightening Prime Minister Scott Morrison’s government pledged sweeping tax cuts and forecast Australia’s first surplus in more than a decade in a budget aimed at engineering a come-from- behind election victory China is drafting rules for overseas investments to be considered part of President Xi Jinping’s Belt and Road Initiative, according to people familiar with the matter, marking the first attempt to better define his signature policy Attorney General William Barr hasn’t discussed any part of Mueller’s report with the White House, according to a Justice Department official, but plans to rely instead on his own judgment in deciding whether some details in the report should be withheld under executive privilege Cryptocurrency traders may not know what caused the abrupt surge in Bitcoin on Tuesday, but they’re going along for the ride anyway; the virtual currency climbed to a fresh 2019 high on Wednesday, building on a spike yesterday that many market participants struggled to explain
Asian equity markets were mostly higher as trade optimism and Chinese PMI data helped the region shrug-off the indecisive lead from the US , where the global stock rally had stalled amid thin volumes, weak durable goods data and ahead of upcoming risk events. ASX 200 (+0.6%) and Nikkei 225 (+1.0%) were positive with Australia led by miners amid strength in iron ore prices which hit record levels in China and as participants also digested the budget which included an upward revision to the first projected surplus in over a decade and proposed AUD 158bln in tax cuts. Japanese stocks were lifted as risk appetite was stimulated by reports US and China are nearing a final trade agreement with most issues resolved but continue to haggle on enforcement and implementation. Hang Seng (+1.2%) and Shanghai Comp. (+1.2%) also benefitted from the trade hopes and after further encouraging data from China in which Caixin Services PMI topped estimates and printed its highest since January 2018. However, the performance of the mainland was somewhat fatigued after its recent bullish streak and with Bank of Communications underperforming on reports China National Council for Social Security Fund plans to sell 1.49bln of Bocom’s A-shares. Finally, 10yr JGBs were lower as trade hopes ensured a lack of safe-haven demand and with selling exacerbated as prices ran through stops at 153.00. SMBC also suggested the BoJ may reduce its purchases today, although this failed to materialize as the BoJ maintained its Rinban amounts which totalled JPY 1.23tln in 1yr-10yr JGBs and which helped alleviate some of the pressure.

Major European indices are firmer [Euro Stoxx 50 +0.7%] as the positivity continues from overnight where sentiment was driven by US-China trade optimism and positive Chinese PMI data, although the FTSE 100 (Unch) is the exception to this with the index weighed on by the Brexit-related Sterling strength. Sector wise, material names (sector +1.5%) lead the gains as copper and iron prices are bolstered by the seemingly positive trade news alongside supply-side woes. On the flip side, healthcare names lag (sector -0.8%) with heavyweights Novartis (-1.0%) and Roche (-0.9%) weighed on by Walgreen’s cut in guidance yesterday. Elsewhere, the tech sector (+1.3%) is supported by advances in AMD yesterday (+3% pre-market) alongside Taiwan Semiconductor stating that they expect chip orders to pick up.

In FX, this week’s risk roller-coaster continues, and the latest turn of the ride has lifted stocks and high beta currencies to the detriment of so-called safe havens, like the Dollar and core bonds. Hence, the Greenback has handed back gains made on Tuesday vs most G10 counterparts and EMs, with the index retreating towards 97.000 again from just over 97.500. The catalysts, another strong Chinese PMI and similar beats across the Eurozone/Europe, bar the UK, reports that the US and China are getting close to a trade agreement and Brexit developments raising prospects of some kind of deal as opposed to no deal. AUD/NZD - The Aussie and Kiwi have benefited most from the resurgence in broad risk appetite, with the former also deriving independent impetus from data in the form of retail sales and trade overnight. Aud/Usd has recovered from near 2019 lows to 0.7100+, but may be hampered by more hefty option expiry interest as 1.6 bn runs off between 0.7100-10 at the NY cut. Meanwhile, Nzd/Usd is hovering just below 0.6800 compared to sub-0.6750 at worst as the Aud/Nzd cross holds close to the upper end of a 1.0495-50 range. EUR/GBP/CAD/CHF - All firmer vs the Usd following underperformance yesterday, with the single currency boosted by better than expected Eurozone services PMIs across the board and marginally topping Tuesday’s 1.1250 peak, but capped by layered off said to be sitting up to 1.1270. Cable tested the water and resistance into 1.3200 on the back of the aforementioned Brexit manoeuvres aimed at reaching a pact to trigger an extension from April 12 that could lead to a softer withdrawal agreement or terms. However, the Pound was derailed to a degree by a significantly weaker than forecast UK services PMI as the headline recoiled below 50 and IHS predicted this means Q1 GDP stagnation before a downturn in H2. The Loonie continues to recoup losses vs its US peer post-contrasting manufacturing PMIs/ISM on Monday with the aid of firmer crude prices and the overall rebound in risk sentiment to probe over 1.3300, while the Franc is back up around 0.9960 from parity at one stage on Tuesday, but softer vs the Eur within 1.1177-1.1208 trading parameters after more dovish/intervention talk from the SNB. SEK/NOK - The Scandi Crowns are still tracking broader swings in risk, along with technical and fundamental impulses, as Eur/Sek and Eur/Nok retreat towards recent lows and chart support levels circa 10.4100 and 9.6000 respectively. EM - The Lira remains embroiled in political uncertainty as the main parties wrangle over regional election results against the backdrop of renewed diplomatic angst between Turkey and the US, while latest inflation data has piled more pressure on the Try and CBRT given a firmer than forecast CPI rate. Unsurprisingly, Usd/Try is holding above 5.6100 vs other Usd/regional pairings that are reversing recent rallies, and even the Rand in wake of a weak SA services PMI.
In commodities, prices are on the front foot amidst the overall risk appetite couple with a falling buck. WTI (+0.1%) and Brent (+0.6%) futures have been grinding higher since last night, shrugging off the surprise build in API crude stocks (+3.0mln vs. Exp. -0.4mln) with the former residing just above USD 62.60/bbl having hit resistance at USD 63.00/bbl. The support the oil complex has seen has mostly been due to supply disruptions rather than demand improvement. Traders will be eyeing the DoE release today, although price action may be muted as Iranian and Venezuelan supply woes/ market risk appetite hold onto the spotlight. Elsewhere, metals across the board are benefiting from the easing buck with spot gold (+0.1%) remaining below USD 1300/oz (for now), whilst copper (+1.2%) surges on trade optimism after reports that US and China are inching closer to a deal, with the Chinese trade delegation heading to Washington today for another round of talks. Furthermore, Barclays noted that copper supply-side disruptions have the potential to boost the red metal to USD 7000/tonne. Finally, Dalian iron ore prices were bolstered to record highs, also hit by supply issues, as damage is calculated from the cyclones in Western Australia. Barclays also raised its 2019 iron ore price forecast to USD 75/tonne (Prev. USD 69/tonne).

DB's Jim Reid concludes the overnight wrap
I visited our new house last night to see how it was progressing with less than three weeks to go of a 9-month renovation project. To say I was blown away was an understatement….. blown away by how much work was needed to be done in 2 and a half weeks! I would say there’s more chance of a Brexit plan being agreed by all parties than it being ready on time but as you’ll see below hopes have been raised on that front last night. Back to the house and the builder told me not to worry and said that it all “usually” comes together at the last minute. Between you and me, the thing I’m most looking forward to is our greatest extravagance. A hot tub? a sauna room? aircon? A wrapping room? No we have none of those... instead the luxury is having designed the kitchen so as to have two dishwashers! Who needs extra cupboard space! Since we’ve had three kids I’ve done more washing up than the rest of my time on this planet. I don’t understand how they can need so many eating and cooking implements and how messy it can get. Life is too short for this so I’m looking forward to opening both doors and shovelling it all in and heading down the golf course instead!
So what will come first, Brexit or me moving in? The chances of the former went up last night as PM May’s press conference after Europe closed was more constructive than expected. Following her marathon cabinet session, May said that she will seek another short Article 50 extension from the EU, will engage with Jeremy Corbyn on an alternative Brexit solution, and will agree to implement whatever solution Parliament passes if these talks break down. This is huge news. She is seemingly now prepared to back down on her prior red lines and also prepared to let Parliament decide on the outcome if she and Mr Corbyn can’t. Recall that the customs union option came within 3 votes of passage on Monday. If parliament could muster the votes to pass that plan or an even softer outcome, PM May has now, for the first time, implied that she would negotiate that with the EU without calling for elections. The removal of that risk and that of hopes of a compromise supported the pound as it rallied +0.88% off its intraday lows after her words. In theory this is very positive news for the pound assuming the Conservative government survives the shrapnel from the internal party in-fighting that this will bring.
In total, the main risks now hinge on the reaction from Labour, the ERG within her own party, from May’s coalition partners the DUP, and from the EU. On the first, opposition leader Corbyn said that he is “very happy” to meet with May, so that’s a positive start. On the ERG, there have been a number of negative comments from members of the group but the worst is probably to come. In a statement, the DUP criticised May’s “lamentable handling” of the negotiations, but said that they will continue to “judge all Brexit outcomes against our clear unionist principles”. That at least leaves open the possibility that the DUP would accept a solution that avoids a border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. Finally, the EU may be unwilling to grant another extension without forcing the UK to participate in EU elections, though we may learn more when Juncker speaks to the European Parliament later today. Donald Tusk seemed to be encouraging patience from his own side.
Prior to last night we learned that there would be no indicative votes today and instead we’re supposed to see MPs debate the new Cooper/Letwin bill, which is designed to prevent a no-deal Brexit next week. We will see if that still occurs given the latest developments. We have until next Wednesday before the emergency EU summit.
Over in markets, it hasn’t quite been so one way in the last 24 hours as it was on Monday with a bit of a lull in newsflow to blame although the Asia session has seen new news. In addition, today’s global non-manufacturing PMIs, tomorrow’s ECB minutes and Friday’s payrolls will also provide us with fresh impetus. We’d expect trade headlines to pick up as China Vice Premier Liu He is scheduled to travel to Washington today to lead a delegation of trade negotiators.
Indeed overnight, the FT has reported that the US and Chinese officials have resolved most of the issues surrounding the deal. The only issues which are yet to be agreed on are what happens to the existing US duties on Chinese goods and the terms of an enforcement mechanism to ensure China keeps to the trade deal. This news, along with better than expected Chinese March Caixin services (at 54.4 vs. 52.3 expected - the highest since January 2018) and composite (52.9 vs. 50.7 last month, highest since June 2018) PMIs, sent Asian markets higher. The Nikkei (+0.83%), Hang Seng (+0.86%), Shanghai Comp (+0.23%) and Kospi (+0.52%) are all up. China’s onshore yuan is up +0.17% to 6.7119. Elsewhere, futures on the S&P 500 are up +0.42%. We also saw Japan’s March services and composite PMIs overnight at 52.0 (vs. 52.3 last month) and 50.4 (vs. 50.7 last month), respectively.
Back to yesterday and after European equity markets marched higher, with the STOXX 600 (+0.35%) closing at its highest level since late September, US equities traded in a bit more of a holding pattern yesterday following the decent three-day run prior to this. The S&P 500 was flat and the DOW -0.30% - the latter hurt by a profit warning from Walgreens Boots, which saw shares fall -12.81%. The NASDAQ (+0.25%) outperformed a bit, mostly thanks to a strong session by Facebook (+3.26%). DB’s Lloyd Walmsley published a bullish report on the stock early yesterday morning (link here ).
Over in rates, Treasuries partially retraced Monday’s steep rise, with 10y yields back down -3.2bps to 2.469% after Monday’s +9.6bps rise. The 2s10s curve steepened slightly to 17bps as two-year yields slid -3.4bps. That came despite a +3.2bps rise in 2y inflation breakevens, partially driven by the oil rally (more below), as the move was driven solely by declining real yields. This morning, yields on 2-year and 10-year treasuries are up 2.1bps and 2.7bps, respectively, thereby further steepening the 2s10s curve to 17.8bps. EM currencies retraced a bit of Monday’s rally as well, with an EM FX index down -0.10%. The Turkish lira remains the most volatile currency in EM space, weakening -1.93% yesterday to within 3% of its 6-month lows.
Bunds also fell -2.2bps and are back down to -0.052% again while Gilts fell -4.3bps in tandem with the Sterling move. BTPs (+2bps) underperformed after Juncker warned that the Italian economy “hasn’t stopped regressing”. In credit, HY spreads were -9bps tighter in Europe but +3bps wider in the US, while WTI oil rose +1.64% following the latest OPEC estimates, which suggested production was down in March. Plus, a regulatory filing by Saudi Aramco showed that the Ghawar oil field – the world’s largest – can pump an estimated 3.8mn barrels per day, notably less than prior estimates of almost 6mn. Oil prices are now up to their highest levels in 5 months, with WTI at $62.60 per barrel and Brent at $69.43.
Moving on. Yesterday’s data in the US proved to be mostly a non-event. Headline durable goods orders in February declined less than expected (-1.6% mom vs. -1.8% expected), however, these were offset by a downward revision to January. The opposite was true for core capex orders, which were down -0.1% mom (vs. +0.1% expected) but offset by an upward revision to January. So net-net a bit of a wash. Last night we also got the March vehicle sales data from several major carmakers. For Fiat Chrysler, Toyota, Honda, and Nissan in aggregate, sales fell -5.5% yoy, modestly better than the -6.2% yoy expected, but still consistent with a slight deceleration in economic activity this year compared to last year. GM reported its Q1 aggregate figures and also showed a drop yoy, while Ford will report tomorrow.
Finally to the day ahead where the data highlight is likely to be the remaining services and composite PMI revisions for March in Europe this morning. We’ll also get February retail sales data for the Euro Area while in the US this afternoon we kick off with the March ADP employment change print (175k expected), followed then by the PMIs and March ISM non-manufacturing (58.0 expected). We’ve also got Fed speakers scheduled with Bostic, George and Barkin speaking in the afternoon at an ABA event (I wanted to put an extra “B” in) while Kashkari then speaks this evening. China Vice Premier Liu He is also scheduled to travel to Washington to lead a delegation of trade negotiators while NATO foreign ministers are due to gather in Washington. Tags"

Fox News apologized Sunday for a live “Fox & Friends” segment graphic that read, “Trump Cuts Aid to 3 Mexican Countries.”…. “We want to clarify and correct something that happened earlier in the show,” the apology read. “We had an inaccurate graphic on screen … we just want to be clear the funding is being cut off to three Central American countries. We apologize for the error, it never should have happened.” The headline appeared for 30 seconds during a discussion about punitive measures taken by President Trump to secure the U.S.-Mexico border.
How is it that the nations #1 cable news channel, a network which claims not only to be “fair and balanced,” but also the source of cogent, knowledgeable, and insightful debate, can be so thoroughly clueless? Sure, I understand that mistakes are made…but you’d think that anyone in charge of producing graphics for a cable news channel broadcast worldwide would have some basic geographic knowledge . Right??
The best part of this scenario? None of the three countries mentioned were Mexico. Let’s hope whoever’s responsible for the graphic doesn’t have aspirations of working in the State Department. "
