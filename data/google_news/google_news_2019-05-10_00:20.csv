Trump Suggests Mueller May Testify; Pelosi Declares ‘Constitutional Crisis’,https://www.nytimes.com,"['Annie Karni', 'Sheryl Gay Stolberg']",05-09-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/09/us/politics/mueller-testify.html,"WASHINGTON — President Trump said Thursday that he would leave it to Attorney General William P. Barr to decide whether the special counsel testifies before Congress, a concession of sorts after Speaker Nancy Pelosi declared the country in a “constitutional crisis” over the president’s blanket refusal to cooperate with the Democrats investigating him.

His comments were a seeming reversal, since Mr. Trump wrote over the weekend on Twitter that the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, should not be allowed to appear before Congress. Mr. Barr — who refused to testify before the House last week amid a spat over the structure of the hearing — has told lawmakers that he has no objection to Mr. Mueller’s testifying.

In a surprise 45-minute news conference in the Roosevelt Room, his first since the release of the Mueller report, Mr. Trump also said he was “pretty surprised” that his eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., was subpoenaed to testify in front of the Senate about his contacts with Russians during the 2016 presidential campaign.

“My son is a good person,” Mr. Trump said. “My son testified for hours and hours. My son was totally exonerated by Mueller.” The president did not make it clear whether he would fight the subpoena, saying: “We’ll see what happens. I’m just very surprised.”"

Americans' support for impeaching Trump rises: Reuters/Ipsos poll,https://www.reuters.com,"['Chris Kahn', 'Min Read']",05-09-2019,2019,5,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-poll/americans-support-for-impeaching-trump-rises-reuters-ipsos-poll-idUSKCN1SF2D9,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The number of Americans who said President Donald Trump should be impeached rose 5 percentage points to 45 percent since mid-April, while more than half said multiple congressional probes of Trump interfered with important government business, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Thursday.

The opinion poll, conducted on Monday, did not make clear whether investigation-fatigued Americans wanted House of Representatives Democrats to pull back on their probes or press forward aggressively and just get impeachment over with.

The question is an urgent one for senior Democratic leaders in the House of Representatives, who are wrestling with whether to launch impeachment proceedings, despite likely insurmountable opposition to it in the Republican-controlled Senate.

On Thursday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi re-emphasized that the leaders of the investigative committees in the Democratic-controlled House were taking a step-by-step approach.

“This is very methodical, it’s very Constitution-based,” Pelosi said. “We won’t go any faster than the facts take us, or any slower than the facts take us.”

In addition to the 45 percent pro-impeachment figure, the Monday poll found that 42 percent of Americans said Trump should not be impeached. The rest said they had no opinion.

Polling on the president

In comparison, an April 18-19 survey found that 40 percent of all Americans wanted to impeach Trump.

The latest poll showed stronger support for impeachment among Democrats and independents.

It also showed that 57 percent of adults agreed that continued investigations into Trump would interfere with important government business. That included about half of all Democrats and three-quarters of all Republicans.

After a nearly two-year investigation by Special Counsel Robert Mueller of Trump and Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election, House Democrats are pursuing multiple inquiries into Trump’s presidency, his family and his business interests.

Trump is stonewalling at least a half-dozen such inquiries, refusing to disclose his tax returns, invoking executive privilege to keep the unredacted Mueller report under wraps and filing unprecedented lawsuits to block House investigators.

“It’s becoming a circus over there” in Washington, said Fatima Alsrogy, 36, a T-shirt designer from Dallas who took the poll. “There are so many more important things the country needs to pay attention to right now.”

Alsrogy, an independent, thinks Trump should be impeached. Yet she also wishes lawmakers would do more to improve the healthcare system for self-employed people like her.

“I bought my own (health) insurance on an Obamacare exchange,” she said. “It’s a huge expense, and I don’t know if Obamacare is going to be amended or taken away. It’s stressful.”

The poll also found that 32 percent agreed that Congress treated the Mueller report fairly, while 47 percent disagreed.

Trump’s popularity was unchanged from a similar poll that ran last week - 39 percent of adults said they approved of Trump, while 55 percent said they disapproved.

The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online in English, throughout the United States. It gathered responses from 1,006 adults and had a credibility interval, a measure of precision, of about 4 percentage points."
Trump says John Kerry ‘should be prosecuted’ for Iran contacts,https://www.foxnews.com,['Adam Shaw'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-kerry-prosecuted-iran,"President Trump on Thursday accused former Secretary of State John Kerry of breaking the law by meeting with Iranian officials last year -- and went so far as to say he should be prosecuted under the Logan Act.

""You know John Kerry speaks to them a lot, and John Kerry tells them not to call. That’s a violation of the Logan Act, and frankly he should be prosecuted on that,"" Trump told reporters at the White House.

TRUMP AND KERRY TRADE BARBS OVER EX-SECRETARY OF STATE'S MEETINGS WITH IRANIAN REGIME

“But my people don’t want to do anything, only the Democrats do that kind of stuff. If it were the opposite way, they’d prosecute him under the Logan Act,” he said.

Trump appears to be partially referring to a reported meeting between Kerry and Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif at the beginning of 2018, part of what the Boston Globe called “an aggressive yet stealthy” mission to put pressure on the Trump administration to keep the Iran nuclear deal.

Such a push was unsuccessful as Trump would announce the U.S. withdrawal from the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPoA) just a few months later.

But Trump has repeatedly accused Kerry of being in violation of the Logan Act, which prohibits private citizens from negotiating on behalf of the U.S. government without authorization. No one has ever been successfully prosecuted under the law, however.

In September, Kerry acknowledged meeting with Zarif “three or four times” since leaving office, admitting to discussing the scrapped nuclear deal, among other issues.

CLINTON SLAMS TRUMP ADMINISTRATION'S 'MAXIMUM PRESSURE' CAMPAIGN

“What I have done is tried to elicit from him what Iran might be willing to do in order to change the dynamic in the Middle East for the better,” Kerry said on Hugh Hewitt's radio show.

On Thursday, Trump indicated he believes the contact between Kerry and Tehran to be ongoing, accusing Kerry of having “many meetings and many phone calls and he’s telling them what to do -- that is a total violation of the Logan Act.”

A spokesman for Kerry pushed back on Trump’s remarks, calling them “simply wrong, end of story.”

“He's wrong about the facts, wrong about the law, and sadly he's been wrong about how to use diplomacy to keep America safe. Secretary Kerry helped negotiate a nuclear agreement that worked to solve an intractable problem,” the spokesman said.

“The world supported it then and supports it still. We'd hope the President would focus on solving foreign policy problems for America instead of attacking his predecessors for theater.”

Trump’s remarks came as the administration imposed sanctions on Tehran’s steel, aluminum, copper and iron sectors this week, the latest pressure the administration is putting on Iran’s already fragile economy.

Iran, meanwhile, announced that it will keep excess uranium instead of selling it as required by the nuclear deal. It also issued an ultimatum to Europe that it will enrich its stockpile in 60 days unless new terms to the deal are negotiated.

President Donald Trump was on a riff about border control agents working to prevent migrants from crossing the border while speaking at his Wednesday night rally in Panama City Beach, Fla.

“You have hundreds and hundreds of people and you have two or three border security people that are brave and great — And don't forget, we don't let them and we can't let them use weapons. We can't. Other countries do. We can't. I would never do that. But how do you stop these people?"" the president said.

As the president posed that question — a rally attendee in the crowd shouted: “shoot them.”

“They screamed shoot em’ ... They were referring to the immigrants.”

In the aftermath of the president’s response to the rally attendee’s inflammatory outburst, the Trump campaign has worked to turn the conversation on Twitter and shift the focus to the president’s statement denouncing the use of weapons by border agents.

The campaign's Deputy Director of Communication and Rapid Response Matt Wolking replied to a number of Twitter users discussing the incident, sending a transcript that excludes part of the president’s reaction to the outburst. He tweeted that Trump said he ""would never let"" border security use weapons like ""other countries do."""
"Trump hits back at Senate subpoena for Don Jr., says he’s ‘very surprised’",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Brooke Singman', 'Brooke Singman Is A Politics Reporter For Fox News. Follow Her On Twitter At']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-hits-back-at-senate-subpoena-for-don-jr-says-hes-very-surprised,"President Trump hit back Thursday at the Senate Intelligence Committee’s move to subpoena his eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., while accusing Democrats pursuing Russia-related investigations even after the closure of Robert Mueller's case of ""conning"" the country.

In the Oval Office, Trump was asked about the subpoena issued to Trump Jr. on Wednesday evening as part of the committee’s Russia investigation.

DONALD TRUMP JR. SUBPOENAED BY SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE, SOURCE SAYS

“I was very surprised. I saw [Chairman Richard] Burr saying there was no collusion two or three weeks ago,” Trump said. “I was very surprised to see my son—my son is a good person, he works hard. The last thing he needs is Washington, D.C. He’d rather not be involved.”

“My son is a good person. He testified for hours and hours. My son was totally exonerated by Mueller who doesn’t like Trump, me,” Trump continued. “And for my son, after being exonerated to now get a subpoena to speak again after telling everyone about a nothing meeting, I’m pretty surprised.”

He added: “I’m just very surprised. I really am.”

The president was asked whether he would block his son from complying with the subpoena, after last month vowing to fight “all” subpoenas issued to administration officials and individuals close to him.

“We’ll see what happens,” Trump replied.

The committee, led by Republican Chairman Richard Burr, R-N.C., and Ranking Member Mark Warner, D-Va., has been investigating Russian interference for the last two years. Burr and Warner issued the subpoena over remarks Trump Jr. made while testifying before the panel in 2017.

One source close to the president's son told Fox News that he has been trying to accommodate the committee's request for more information, but the committee has been making unreasonable demands.

Fox News is told the committee sought an extensive appearance covering many topics, which one source described as a ""complete redo."" Sources close to Trump Jr. called the subpoena a political stunt.

The committee’s demand to have Trump Jr. testify again reportedly is related to former Trump attorney Michael Cohen’s testimony earlier this year. Cohen, who reported to prison this week to begin a three-year sentence, told a House committee that he had briefed Trump Jr. approximately 10 times about a plan to build a Trump Tower in Moscow.

But in 2017, Trump Jr. told the Senate Intelligence Committee he was only “peripherally aware” of the proposal.

Trump Jr. has testified before congressional committees multiple times as part of their Russia investigations. Trump Jr. first fell under scrutiny in the early summer of 2017, after it was revealed that he helped to organize, and then attend, a meeting with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya in Trump Tower in New York City. The meeting was initially billed as one where Trump Jr. and members of the Trump campaign could obtain “dirt” on Hillary Clinton for their benefit in the 2016 election. The meeting apparently did not reveal any dirt on Clinton, but Trump Jr., Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner, and former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort attended the June 2016 meeting. Special Counsel Robert Mueller also investigated the meeting.

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., also blasted Burr and Warner’s decision to subpoena Trump Jr.

.@DonaldJTrumpJr has already spent dozens of hours testifying in front of Congressional committees. Endless investigations--by either party--won’t change the fact that there was NO collusion. It’s time to move on. It’s time to focus on ISSUES, not investigations,” McCarthy tweeted Wednesday.

Meanwhile, the president weighed in on congressional Democrats leading Trump-focused investigations. The president specifically called out House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y. (who is leading the effort to hold Attorney General Bill Barr in contempt for not turning over unredacted Mueller files) and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif.

“Now, guys like Nadler, who I fought for years successfully in New York…now I have to beat him again,” Trump said. “Over nothing. Over a hoax. They know it’s a hoax. Nadler is a smart guy. Schiff is a smart guy.”

He added: “But when Schiff goes to the microphone, he’s conning this whole country, and he knows this, and after, he goes back into a room and talks to his friends and he laughs.”

HOUSE PANEL VOTES TO HOLD BARR IN CONTEMPT, AS TRUMP ASSERTS EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE OVER MUELLER FILES

The president also was asked whether Special Counsel Robert Mueller would be allowed to testify before Congress, a decision, he said, he would leave up to Barr. It is unclear if that decision, though, would be made by the attorney general.

“I’m going to leave that up to our great attorney general. He’ll make a decision,” Trump said, again touting his cooperation with the nearly two-year-long investigation. “No collusion and no obstruction. People say, how can you obstruct when there was no crime? It’s worse than that. Not only was there no crime, the crime was on the other side.”

The president’s comments about “the other side” come after Barr has vowed to review the “origins” of the Russia investigation at the FBI and the Justice Department. Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz is also investigating alleged misconduct related to Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrants. That probe is expected to be complete in the coming weeks.

“After spending all that money, all that time, two years, they come up with a report,” Trump said. “Mueller is no friend of mine. So I’ll leave it to the attorney general. To me, it looks like a re-do.”

The president's comments on Thursday come after the House Judiciary Committee voted to hold Barr in contempt of Congress for defying a subpoena for Mueller's unredacted Russia report and underlying documents, after the president asserted executive privilege in a bid to protect those files from release.

“We did not relish doing this, but we have no choice,” Nadler said after the vote, adding, ""We’ve talked for a long time about approaching a constitutional crisis. We are now in it.""

"Trump declares 'invasion' at border after DHS says 1 percent of Honduras, Guatemala entered US",https://www.foxnews.com,['Danielle Wallace'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-invasion-border-dhs-one-percent-honduras-guatemala,"A day after the acting Homeland Security secretary estimated that more than 1 percent of the populations of Guatemala and Honduras had entered the U.S. since September, President Trump declared an “invasion” at the U.S.-Mexico border.

Meanwhile, his administration expects record numbers of migrants to arrive from Central America in the coming months.

""When you see these caravans starting out with 20,000 people, that's an invasion,” Trump said at his Wednesday evening “Make American Great Again” rally in Panama City, Fla., defending his declaration of a national emergency at the border earlier this year. “No nation can tolerate a massive organized violation of its immigration laws. And no one should run for office without an ironclad pledge to protect and defend America's borders.""

TRUMP DEFENDS NATIONAL EMERGENCY DECLARATION AT MEXICO BORDER, SAYS DEMS 'DON'T MIND CRIME'

The White House recently proposed charging asylum-seekers a fee to process their applications in an effort to crack down on the surge of Central American migrants trying to cross into the U.S.

In a speech Tuesday to the 49th Washington Conference of the Americas, acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan described why most migrants arriving at the U.S. border come from Guatemala, Honduras or El Salvador.

“Guatemala and Honduras have seen over 1 percent of their total population migrate to the U.S. in the first seven months of this fiscal year,” McAleenan said, citing government-funded research completed by Vanderbilt University. He said most migrants come to escape extreme poverty and stay because of a flawed U.S. immigration system.

“One department of Guatemala, Huehuetenango, has seen almost 35,000 of its residents — close to 3 percent of the population — migrate to the U.S. in that time frame,” McAleenan added.

The flawed U.S. immigration system often permits families and unaccompanied minors to live in the United States for months or years as their asylum claims are processed, even though most will never obtain legal status. Central Americans notice family or neighbors leave and successfully make it into the U.S., so they too choose to embark on the journey, the DHS chief explained.

“In March, we had over 103,000 irregular arrivals of undocumented migrants — 90 percent crossing the U.S. border unlawfully and unsafely in the hands of human smugglers. We will see similar numbers in April,” McAleenan continued, explaining that he expects current trends to continue in the upcoming months.

According to the study carried out by Vanderbilt’s Latin American Public Opinion Project in Guatemala earlier this year, 1 in 4 Guatemalans intend to migrate from Guatemala, with 85 percent of them indicating the U.S. as their preferred destination.

“That’s over 4 million Guatemalans who intend to migrate to the United States,” McAleenan said. The DHS head is working with Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and senior adviser, on an immigration bill designed to overhaul the legal immigration system, the Washington Post reported.

The proposed legislation will include “an aggressive and holistic strategy” to work together with Central America officials in order to identify “pushes” that drive migrants out of Central America.

“We want to work closely with all three countries' customs administrations to help increase the efficiency of cross-border trade by reducing supply chain barriers and support exports and job creation,"" McAleenan said Tuesday, according to the Washington Examiner. ""From an infrastructure, technology, automation, and legal perspective, DHS’s Customs and Border Protection is pursuing broad support for the region’s customs administrations to modernize practices in all of these areas.”

House Judiciary votes to hold Barr in contempt for defying Mueller report subpoena,https://www.cbsnews.com,"['Emily Tillett', 'Emily Tillett Is A Politics Reporter', 'Video Editor For Cbs News Digital', 'Grace Segers']",05-08-2019,2019,5,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/barr-in-contempt-of-congress-hearing-judiciary-committee-vote-attorney-general-barr-mueller-report-today-2019-05-08/,"After negotiations with the Department of Justice fell apart, House Democrats on the Judiciary Committee voted to find Attorney General William Barr in contempt for not complying with the panel's subpoenas to provide documents related to special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia report.

The vote passed along party lines, 24-16, after six hours of contentious debate on the topic. The contempt resolution will now go to the full House for a vote, where it is expected to pass, given the Democratic majority.

""It is deeply disappointing that elected representatives of the American people have chosen to engage in such inappropriate political theatrics,"" the Justice Department said in a statement in response to the vote.

Shortly before vote proceedings began Wednesday morning, the president asserted privilege over the entire Mueller report and underlying documents.

In response to the assertion of executive privilege, Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler said in his opening statement Wednesday that the administration was ""misapplying the doctrine of executive privilege,"" and called the decision a ""clear escalation in the Trump administration's blanket defiance"" of the constitutional duties of Congress.

""The information we are requesting is entirely in our legal right to receive,"" Nadler said. Democrats are adamant that Barr should turn over the entire unredacted Mueller report and any underlying materials, which the Justice Department has refused. The Department has offered to allow a few members of Congress to view a less redacted version of the report, under the condition that these members do not speak with their colleagues about the report.

""Our fight is about defending the rights of Congress to hold the president -- any president -- accountable,"" Nadler added.

Before the vote, Democrats and Republicans took turns condemning the opposite party for their positions on the Mueller investigation. Republicans like Ranking Member Doug Collins and Rep. Steve Chabot on the committee took the opportunity to condemn committee Democrats' position, and claim that the true scandal was the origins of Mueller's report. GOP Rep. Louie Gohmert called the report an ""attempted coup,"" using the language of President Trump.

Republicans and Democrats also simmered down for a legitimate debate about why they were voting to hold Barr in contempt. Nadler argued that two months of ignored requests for cooperation from the Justice Department was enough time for the committee to justify a contempt vote, while Republicans disagreed.

The committee unanimously approved an amendment proposed by Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz saying that the vote to hold Barr in contempt would not ""be construed as a directive for the Attorney General to violate Federal law or rules."" Republicans argued that the subpoena requested Barr to commit a crime by revealing redacted grand jury material. Democrats said that they only asked for the Justice Department's assistance in court to get that material revealed.

Nadler also called the subpoena ""the beginning of a dialogue,"" as the Justice Department had refused to negotiate ""in good faith,"" which Republicans immediately seized on. The GOP members of the committee argued that Democrats had ended the dialogue by issuing a subpoena.

Democrats opposed two other Republican-proposed amendments to the vote. In a press conference after the vote, Nadler said that Barr's unwillingness to cooperate with House Democrats was a ""constitutional crisis."" When asked whether this crisis required impeachment proceedings, Nadler demurred.

""That may not be the best answer in a constitutional crisis,"" Nadler said.

Nadler warns of ""constitutional crisis"" after Barr contempt vote

Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd wrote a letter to Nadler condemning the contempt vote and asserting executive privilege shortly before the committee proceedings began.

""Unfortunately, rather than allowing negotiations to continue, you scheduled an unnecessary contempt vote, which you refused to postpone to allow additional time for compromise,"" Boyd said.

Barr also wrote a letter to Mr. Trump Wednesday, asking him to ""make a protective assertion of executive privilege with respect to Department of Justice documents recently subpoenaed by the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives.""

""As with President Clinton's assertion in 1996, you would be making only a preliminary, protective assertion of executive privilege designed to ensure your ability to make a final assertion, if necessary, over some or all of the subpoenaed materials,"" Barr said.

The administration's assertion of executive privilege comes after the Justice Department warned it would ask the president to invoke executive privilege over the entire Mueller report if the committee does not cancel its planned vote, according to a letter from Boyd Tuesday evening.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told Washington Post reporter Robert Costa Wednesday morning that she believes Barr should be held in contempt of Congress. She also declined to make a judgment on whether Barr should be impeached, saying that ""nothing is never off the table.""

""For the White House to be degrading the office the president holds, degrading the Constitution of the United States and degrading the first branch of government, the legislative branch, that's just not decent,"" Pelosi said.

Nadler has also threatened to hold former White House lawyer Don McGahn in contempt if he didn't respond to congressional subpoenas for similar documents. The White House has since ordered McGahn not to comply with the subpoena, according to a letter obtained by CBS News."
"Amazon Gave Jobs to DOD Staff Working on Cloud Bid, Lawsuit Claims",http://fortune.com,['Naomi Nix'],05-08-2019,2019,5,http://fortune.com/2019/05/08/amazon-oracle-pentagon-cloud-lawsuit/,"At least two Pentagon employees were offered jobs at Amazon.com Inc. while working on the Defense Department’s $10 billion cloud contract, a lawsuit filed by Oracle Corp. alleges.

The amended complaint, made public on Tuesday, claims Deap Ubhi, a former employee at a high-level Defense Department technology unit, helped design the cloud contract in a way that was favorable to Amazon after receiving “significant” job and bonus offers from the e-commerce giant.

Oracle’s latest court action comes weeks after the Pentagon announced it had eliminated Oracle and International Business Machines Corp. from the bidding because they didn’t meet the minimum criteria, leaving Amazon and Microsoft Corp. as the last remaining competitors.

The Pentagon, which announced the so-called JEDI competition in March of last year, doesn’t expect to award the contract before July 19.

Ubhi, who had worked at Amazon before joining the government, helped craft the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure, or JEDI, procurement for weeks after accepting a job offer in October 2017 from Amazon Web Services, the company’s cloud unit, according to the lawsuit. Ubhi then made up an “elaborate lie” about an Amazon offer to buy his startup company, Tablehero, when he “belatedly” recused himself from working on the contract, the lawsuit alleges.

JEDI Contracting Process

The lawsuit also contends that an unnamed former official connected with the Navy participated in the JEDI contracting process even after accepting a position with Amazon Web Services.

Ubhi is still employed by Amazon Web Services, according to his Twitter account.

An Amazon representative didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. The Defense Department declined to comment. Efforts to reach Ubhi through multiple emails and by telephone were unsuccessful.

Oracle first filed its lawsuit in December in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, alleging the Pentagon crafted overly narrow contract requirements and failed to investigate relationships between former Defense Department employees and Amazon.

The newest allegations may bolster Oracle’s argument that terms for the cloud project violate federal procurement standards. The cloud project involves transitioning massive amount of Defense Department data to a commercially-operated cloud system.

Oracle’s lawsuit also made conflict-of-interest allegations about Anthony DeMartino, former deputy chief of staff in the secretary of defense’s office. DeMartino had previously consulted for Amazon Web Services before assuming his role at the Pentagon.

In February, a judge paused court proceedings in the case to allow the Pentagon to review new information about potential conflicts of interests. The Pentagon said it determined that the acquisition process for the contract wasn’t tainted by alleged conflicts of interest.

In November, the U.S. Government Accountability Office also rejected Oracle’s conflict-of-interest allegations in a separate protest. The watchdog agency said the evidence it reviewed indicated that neither DeMartino nor Ubhi had substantive input into the contract’s terms or the procurement process.

Tech companies including Oracle banded together in an informal coalition last year to urge the Defense Department to split the contract among several suppliers.

Earlier: New Amazon Bias Charge Likely to Delay Pentagon’s Cloud Contract

They said the winner-take-all approach would lock the Pentagon into a single vendor and would heighten security risks. The department has said that making multiple awards under current acquisition law would be a slow process that could prevent it from quickly delivering new capabilities.

The JEDI contract could threaten the growth of a longstanding business that IBM and Oracle have with the Defense Department as it seeks to move its legacy technologies into a commercially-operated cloud system. Both companies were late entrants into the cloud market and have struggled to catch up to Amazon in the private and public sectors.

Amazon was widely seen as the frontrunner for the cloud contract because it previously won a $600 million deal cloud deal from the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and obtained higher levels of federal security authorizations than its peers.

Challenge Requirements

Oracle Executive Vice President Kenneth Glueck, who leads the company’s Washington lobbying operation, said in a recent interview with Bloomberg News that the company will continue to challenge requirements for the contract in conversations with lawmakers on Capitol Hill.

“You read the RFP, and it just screams Amazon,” Glueck said in an interview April 26, referring to the Defense Department’s request for proposals. “The RFP emphasizes all the things Amazon is very good at” and “completely de-emphasizes the things they’re not very good at.”"

St. Paul, Minn. — On average, about 20 veterans a day die by suicide. Since 2017, 25 veterans have taken their lives on the grounds of Veterans Affairs hospitals, including seven this year and at least four last month.

In February of last year, Justin Miller died by suicide in the parking lot of a Veterans Administration hospital in Minneapolis. The Marine veteran was 33. Justin, a trumpet player, made the band, but the Marines saw he could make another contribution as a marksman in Iraq manning a checkpoint with bomb-sniffing dogs.

""If the dog sat down, pull the trigger. Those were his orders. And he said he did that for weeks, day in, day out,"" said Gregory Miller, Justin's father.

When he left the Marines in 2007, his family said he changed. While he still volunteered to play his trumpet at various occasions, he was increasingly depressed and even suicidal. Eventually he sought help at a Veterans Affairs hospital.

""We said we loved each other. I kissed him, and that was the last time I saw my son,"" Miller said.

After three days at the VA, he died.

""He went out to his car. He looked at his phone. He saw the text from my dad, saying 'I love you. Come home.' And at some point he took his own life,"" said Alissa Harrington, Justin's sister.

Experts in this field say veterans who kill themselves on VA grounds are making a statement about their treatment. A federal investigation of Miller's death said the Minneapolis VA made multiple mistakes, from not scheduling a follow-up to overlooking his access to firearms.

""They have people, but they're not trained the way they're supposed to be,"" Miller said.

Some 6,000 veterans kill themselves every year. VA Secretary Robert Wilkie, whose department serves 9.5 million people, said in the last year, they have had 240 interventions where they stopped veterans from taking their lives. Since October, the VA has screened 900,000 veterans for mental health issues.

""Of that 900,000 we culled it down to 3,000. Three thousands veterans our medical professionals say might be at risk and we are monitoring them as closely as we can,"" Wilkie said. ""That means calls, that means visits — bringing them into our centers.""

In Miller's case, antidepressants came in the mail from the VA two days after he died. ""The worst part of his funeral was that they didn't have a live trumpet player. There was no one there to play for him,"" Harrington said.

The silent trumpet at his grave was a gift from his dad."
"E.P.A. Leaders Disregarded Agency’s Experts in Issuing Asbestos Rule, Memos Show",https://www.nytimes.com,['Lisa Friedman'],05-08-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/08/climate/epa-asbestos-rule-scientists.html,"Want climate news in your inbox?

WASHINGTON — Senior officials at the Environmental Protection Agency disregarded the advice of their own scientists and lawyers in April when the agency issued a rule that restricted but did not ban asbestos, according to two internal memos.

Because of its fiber strength and resistance to heat, asbestos has long been used in insulation and construction materials. It is also is a known carcinogen. Last month’s rule kept open a way for manufacturers to adopt new uses for asbestos, or return to certain older uses, but only with E.P.A. approval.

Andrew Wheeler, the E.P.A. administrator, said when the rule was issued that it would significantly strengthen public health protections. But in the memos, dated Aug. 10, more than a dozen of E.P.A.’s own experts urged the agency to ban asbestos outright, as do most other industrialized nations.

“Rather than allow for (even with restrictions) any new uses for asbestos, E.P.A. should seek to ban all new uses of asbestos because the extreme harm from this chemical substance outweighs any benefit — and because there are adequate alternatives to asbestos,” staff members wrote."
DOJ brass praise Rosenstein’s Russia probe leadership at send-off ceremony,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Brooke Singman', 'Brooke Singman Is A Politics Reporter For Fox News. Follow Her On Twitter At']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/doj-brass-praise-rosensteins-russia-probe-leadership-at-send-off-ceremony,"Top current and former Justice Department leadership praised Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein for his “exceptional” leadership throughout the Russia investigation at his send-off ceremony Thursday, marking the conclusion of his nearly 30-year tenure at the agency.

Rosenstein was honored at the Robert F. Kennedy Building Thursday, following submitting his resignation to President Trump last month. Rosenstein sat on stage between Attorney General Bill Barr, former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, and FBI Director Christopher Wray—all of whom touted Rosenstein’s record and character throughout his career, but specifically over the last two years.

HOUSE PANEL VOTES TO HOLD BARR IN CONTEMPT, AS TRUMP ASSERTS EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE OVER MUELLER FILES

“Rod, you did your duty as it fell upon you,” Sessions, who resigned last year after the midterm elections, said on Thursday. “You didn’t ask for it—that’s for sure.”

Rosenstein, 54, previously served as deputy assistant attorney general and a U.S. attorney for the District of Maryland. But during the Trump administration, he became deputy attorney general to Sessions. Rosenstein ultimately took oversight of the Russia investigation upon Sessions’ recusal in early 2017 due to his work with the Trump campaign.

Sessions added that Rosenstein “didn’t start” the investigation, and noted that sometimes, “these things just become unstoppable.”

“Decisions had to be made, and those decisions fell to him,” Sessions continued, adding that decisions were made “all in accordance with procedures of the Justice Department.”

“Rod understood better than most that justice would be best served by appointing a special counsel.”

He added: “You have honorably overseen this process, which has affirmed the rule of law and achieved a degree of justice.”

Sessions called Rosenstein a “friend and a loyal partner,” and reminisced on their “many wonderful times"" together.

Wray also praised Rosenstein and thanked him for his “dedication and service.""

“I have been grateful for Rod’s counsel and support,” Wray said. “A friend whose service has weathered the test of time.”

Rosenstein submitted his resignation following the release of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report. Rosenstein worked alongside Barr and Mueller, to determine which portions of the report could be released to Congress and to the public, and which needed redactions to protect sources and methods and grand jury material.

Barr himself has fallen under intense scrutiny over the handling of the report. The House Judiciary Committee this week voted to hold Barr in contempt of Congress for defying a subpoena for the full Mueller report and underlying documents.

But Barr praised Rosenstein on Thursday and said he has been “fortunate” to work with him.

“It’s been a real privilege and pleasure to have him with me these last several weeks,” Barr said, adding that Rosenstein has “exceptional intelligence, sound judgment crafted from experience, composure even amid scrutiny” and an “upbeat spirit” and “sense of humor.”

“He is an exceptional leader,” Barr said and presented Rosenstein with a flag that was flown above the main Justice Department.

Rosenstein fell into the political crosshairs throughout his tenure and was on the receiving end of the president’s ire over the Russia investigation.

Early on in his oversight of the probe, on May 8, 2017, at his recommendation, Trump fired then-FBI Director James Comey. Just a week later, Rosenstein appointed Special Counsel Robert Mueller and took oversight of that probe until November 2018, when former Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker took over.

IMPRISONING BILL BARR IS LEFT'S NEW RALLYING CRY: 'HAVE HIM LOCKED UP'

Rumors of Rosenstein’s resignation, or even firing, swirled for months—especially after Trump accused him of pursuing a “treasonous” plot against him. Last year, a report revealed that during a meeting, Rosenstein suggested wearing a “wire” to record the president - some of those there said he was joking - and suggested invoking the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from office. The meeting reportedly took place in the days after Comey’s firing.

Fox News learned that the meeting included several high-profile FBI officials, including former Deputy Director Andrew McCabe and former FBI counsel Lisa Page on May 16, 2017. Mueller was appointed as special counsel the following day. Rosenstein, though, repeatedly denied pursuing a recording of the president and pushed back on claims of considering invoking the amendment.

But last month, Rosenstein officially resigned, and thanked Trump for “the opportunity to serve; for the courtesy and humor you often display in our personal conversations; and for the goals you set in your inaugural address: patriotism, unity, safety, education, and prosperity, because ‘a nation exists to serve its citizens.’”

On Thursday, after thanking his Justice Department colleagues, Rosenstein took the podium and said: “I leave here confident that justice is in good hands. It’s in your hands.”

Justice Department Charges Daniel Everette Hale With Leaking Secrets to Media,https://www.thedailybeast.com,['Olivia Messer'],05-09-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/justice-department-charges-daniel-everette-hale-with-leaking-secrets-to-media,"A former intelligence analyst at the National Security Agency has been charged with leaking classified information to the press about the Obama administration’s use of armed drones, the Department of Justice announced on Thursday. It’s the latest in a series of prosecutions by the Trump administration aimed at sources of the press.

Daniel Everette Hale, 31, was charged under the Espionage Act of illegally disclosing top-secret and secret documents to a news organization, according to an indictment filed in March and unsealed Thursday. He was arrested in Nashville, Tennessee on Thursday morning.

Details from the indictment suggest the organization is The Intercept, which did not respond to a request for comment. It is the third time the Justice Department has prosecuted an alleged Intercept source in the past two years.

Hale served in the Air Force from July 2009 to July 2013, during which time he was assigned to the National Security Agency, according to the indictment. He was deployed to Afghanistan, where he worked as an intelligence analyst. While still at the NSA, in April 2013, Hale allegedly began communicating with an unnamed reporter.

The two met on multiple occasions and communicated through an encrypted messaging platform, according to the indictment. Hale allegedly texted a friend in May 2013, claiming that “[the reporter] wants me to tell my story about working with drones at the opening screening of his documentary about the war and the use of drones.”

Hale left the Air Force in July 2013 and was hired by a defense contractor, where he was assigned to the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency. From February to August 2014, Hale allegedly printed a total of 36 documents and provided at least 17 to the reporter, some of which were unclassified, according to the indictment. Eleven were secret or top secret documents.

The documents contained a PowerPoint presentation on counterterrorism operations, described a military campaign targeting Al-Qaeda, included information gathered by the NSA on specific named targets, and outlined U.S. military technical capabilities. The documents were later compiled and published by the news website and in a book authored by the reporter, according to the indictment.

Hale was charged with theft of government property and several other counts under the Espionage Act.

Hale’s arrest comes amid a crackdown on leakers to journalists by the Trump administration. Last month, the U.S. charged WikiLeaks leader Julian Assange with allegedly helping veteran intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning crack a computer password to steal classified documents. In October, a Treasury Department employee was charged with sharing financial information on targets of the Mueller investigation with BuzzFeed.

Last year, two purported Intercept sources were also prosecuted. Former NSA contractor Reality Winner was sentenced to 63 months in prison for leaking classified information about Russian election interference to The Intercept. In October, former FBI agent Terry Albury was sentenced to four years in prison after he pleaded guilty to making an unauthorized disclosure of national defense information, apparently related to how the FBI recruits informants."
Settlement in Fast and Furious executive privilege lawsuit between DOJ and the House,https://www.cnn.com,['Katelyn Polantz'],05-08-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/08/politics/fast-and-furious-settlement-doj-house/index.html,"(CNN) Amid the contempt and privilege fight over the Mueller report in Congress on Wednesday, the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee and the Justice Department are trying to end another major battle over executive privilege that has lasted years.

The Democrat-led House and the Justice Department announced to a federal appeals court in Washington on Wednesday that they had reached a settlement in the Operation Fast and Furious court case, which began as an Obama-era privilege standoff over a subpoena from Congress.

It led to the then-Republican-controlled House holding then-Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt in 2012, yet the litigation dragged on. A previous attempt last year to end the court fight was stopped by a trial-court judge, after the two sides sought to throw out her opinions in the case because of how they could play into future privilege fights.

The long-running case was a persistent reminder in recent years of how long a court fight over privilege can take -- especially on the same day a congressional committee voted to approve holding now-Attorney General William Barr in contempt for failing to turn over the full unredacted Mueller report, and the White House asserted executive privilege over the report's entirety to stymie Congress. The Mueller report clash appears to be headed for court.

In the Fast and Furious case, the House was seeking documents in response to a subpoena regarding an ill-fated program that sought to track guns that federal agents allowed into Mexico. The Justice Department initially asserted privilege over all the documents, and even after years of litigation still refused to give Congress some information about the program.

Shanahan to become the next U.S. secretary of defense, following his time serving as acting secretary.

The president's decision to have Shanahan permanently lead the department is ""based upon his outstanding service to the Country and his demonstrated ability to lead,"" a statement tweeted by Sanders said.

""Acting Secretary Shanahan has proven over the last several months that he is beyond qualified to lead the Department of Defense, and he will continue to do so,"" the statement said.

FLASHBACK: DEFENSE SECRETARY JAMES MATTIS TO LEAVE AS OF JANUARY 1; TRUMP TAPS PATRICK SHANAHAN AS ACTING SECRETARY OF DEFENSE

Shanahan released a statement following the White House's announcement, saying he is ""honored"" by Trump's decision.

“If confirmed by the Senate, I will continue the aggressive implementation of our National Defense Strategy,"" he said. ""I remain committed to modernizing the force so our remarkable Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, and Marines have everything they need to keep our military lethal and our country safe.”

Fox News reported last month that Trump was expected to formally nominate Shanahan as his permanent defense secretary. Shanahan worked at Boeing for over 30 years before coming to the Pentagon as then-Defense Secretary Jim Mattis’s deputy at the start of the Trump administration. He has filled the role of acting defense secretary since Mattis' resignation last year.

Shanahan spoke to reporters outside the Pentagon Thursday, telling them that his priorities moving forward are to ""do the job.""

""The national defense strategy obviously is the high priority, but as you can tell there are real-world events that happen every day so you have to spin a lot of plates,” he said, before fielding questions on Iran and North Korea.

VA mortgage lenders hit with federal subpoenas,https://www.politico.com,['Lorraine Woellert'],05-07-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/07/va-mortgage-lenders-federal-subpoenas-1414318,"Some VA lenders have drawn scrutiny from regulators after they sold short-term, adjustable-rate mortgages to military homeowners as interest rates climbed. | Charles Dharapak, File/AP Photo defense VA mortgage lenders hit with federal subpoenas

Federal investigators have issued subpoenas to several mortgage lenders that make loans to military veterans, seeking information on delinquencies and payments.

The investigation is being led by the Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Inspector General in cooperation with the U.S. attorney in the Eastern District of New York, according to four people with knowledge of the subpoenas.

Story Continued Below

At least eight lenders, and likely more, have been asked to turn over hundreds of files on VA home loans made between 2013 and 2017, according to two people with knowledge of the request.

The requests include questions about quality control and loan audits.

Some VA lenders have drawn scrutiny from regulators after they sold short-term, adjustable-rate mortgages to military homeowners as interest rates climbed. One VA program in particular — the Interest Rate Reduction Refinance Loan, or IRRRL — allows lenders to put existing VA borrowers into new loans without an appraisal or underwriting and was ripe for abuse.

Michael Nacincik, a spokesperson for the Department of Veterans Affairs OIG, and John Marzulli, a spokesperson for the U.S. attorney in Brooklyn, declined to comment. Both said they could neither confirm nor deny the existence of any investigation.

Jeffrey London, executive director of the VA’s Loan Guaranty Service, did not respond to requests for comment.

On Friday, Ginnie Mae said it was weighing whether to exclude some of those VA loans from its pooled securities in an effort to tackle a wave of rapid-fire mortgage refinancings that have left some military service members deeper in debt.

In a 14-page request for input, the government mortgage agency called the practice, known as churning, “unhealthy” for the agency.

The loan documents requested by investigators weren’t limited to IRRRLs, according to one person with knowledge of the subpoenas.

The VA subpoenas are landing as HUD is taking steps to rein in the prosecution of lenders who sell mortgages backed by the Federal Housing Administration.

Many of the nation’s largest banks, including JPMorgan Chase, stopped offering FHA loans after the government, under former President Barack Obama, used the False Claims Act to extract billions of dollars in settlements from dozens of big lenders.

FHA Commissioner Brian Montgomery, an appointee of President Donald Trump, has said those cases went too far and that the Trump administration is working with the DOJ to change how the False Claims Act is used against lenders."
"Top US general: Pentagon, DHS working on 'multiyear plan' for border",https://thehill.com,[],05-08-2019,2019,5,https://thehill.com/policy/defense/442758-top-us-general-pentagon-dhs-working-on-multi-year-plan-for-border,"The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on Wednesday said that the Pentagon is working with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to develop a “multiyear plan"" for the border, suggesting that active duty and National Guard troops will be deployed to the southern border for the remainder of President’s Trump's first term.

“What we’re hopeful to do is to have, in fairly short order, for the secretary of Homeland Security, a much more predictable, comprehensive plan for the next couple years,” Gen. Joseph Dunford said during a Senate Appropriations defense subcommittee hearing.

The Defense Department has provided a two-star general “plus a number of planners” to DHS “to “lay out the next couple of years.”

Dunford said the so-called interagency planning team will prepare around the number of migrants expected to come to the southern U.S. border, the capacity of DHS to handle the migrants and the expected support DHS will need from the rest of the government.

“Although the commitment to the border hasn’t impacted our preparedness for other missions at this point, what we wanted to do is get into a more predictable mode of the requirements that the Department of Homeland Security has and do better at integrating across the government,” Dunford said.

There are now about 4,364 U.S. service member at the border, a mix of active-duty and National Guard members, according to acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan, who testified alongside Dunford.

About 1,167 of the service members are performing the primary role of monitoring and detection, but a broader set of missions range from logistical support to aviation support to food service.

The administration has said troops will stay at such posts until DHS “no longer requires [Department of Defense] support to secure the southern border.”

As of last month, the deployment is expected to cost at least $534 million by the end of the fiscal year in September.

Late last month, Shanahan approved a DHS request to send about 320 more military personnel to help with handling migrants entering the United States, easing restrictions on troops interacting with migrants.

In addition, the Army Corps of Engineer is currently on contract to build about 256 miles of barrier.

“How you will see this materialize in the next six months is about 63 new miles of wall will come online, so about half a mile a day will be produced,” Shanahan said."
Economists flee Agriculture Dept. after feeling punished under Trump,https://www.politico.com,"['Ryan Mccrimmon', 'Doug Palmer']",05-07-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/07/agriculture-economists-leave-trump-1307146,"Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue's moves to limit his agency's research arm have led to a string of departures from the Economic Research Service, whose reports detail how farmers have been hurt by President Donald Trump's trade feuds. | J. Scott Applewhite/AP Photo Agriculture Economists flee Agriculture Dept. after feeling punished under Trump Reports showing farmers hurt by the president’s policies have drawn the ire of top officials.

Economists in the Agriculture Department's research branch say the Trump administration is retaliating against them for publishing reports that shed negative light on White House policies, spurring an exodus that included six of them quitting the department on a single day in late April.

The Economic Research Service — a source of closely read reports on farm income and other topics that can shape federal policy, planting decisions and commodity markets — has run afoul of Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue with its findings on how farmers have been financially harmed by President Donald Trump's trade feuds, the Republican tax code rewrite and other sensitive issues, according to current and former agency employees.

Story Continued Below

The reports highlight the continued decline under Trump’s watch in farm income, which has dropped about 50 percent since 2013. Rural voters were a crucial source of support for Trump in 2016, and analysts say even a small retreat in 2020 could jeopardize the president’s standing in several battleground states.

“The administration didn’t appreciate some of our findings, so this is retaliation to harm the agency and send a message,” said one current ERS employee, who asked not to be named to avoid retribution.

For example, two ERS researchers presented a paper at an economic conference in early 2018 that indicated the GOP tax overhaul would largely benefit the wealthiest farmers — generating negative press coverage that staff members said irked senior officials at USDA.

Then, in August, Perdue stunned members of the roughly 300-member research service by announcing plans to bring ERS under the control of USDA’s chief economist, who reports more directly to the secretary. Equally significant, he said the USDA would move the agency out of Washington to a location closer to the U.S. heartland.

Members of the agency were also caught off-guard last summer when Perdue’s office issued an internal memo directing ERS and other research branches to include disclaimers in their peer-reviewed publications stating that the findings were “preliminary” and “should not be construed to represent any agency determination or policy” — seen as a way of watering down any unflattering data from the department’s own experts.

The move to uproot the agency has led to a brain-drain of experienced researchers. So far in fiscal 2019, non-retirement departures from the agency have more than doubled on an annualized basis compared to the previous three-year average, according to data collected by employees.

Six of the economists — made up of specialists in the agricultural economy, farm taxation and food programs with more than 50 years of combined experience at ERS — left the agency at the end of April, out of frustration with the relocation process or in some cases suspicion about Perdue’s efforts to reshape USDA’s research wing, according to coworkers. More are planning to leave in the coming months.

For his part, Perdue has said the relocation was motivated by his desire to save taxpayer dollars, bring the research service closer to major farming regions, and help attract economists who could be deterred by Washington’s high cost of living.

“I really have been a little surprised with the naysayers on this,” he said last month at a Senate Appropriations hearing, touting the move as a common-sense, cost-cutting measure.

Perdue’s office declined to provide information on the numbers of employees who’ve quit or respond to allegations of political interference in the research service.

But the secretary alluded to frustrations with the quality of USDA research in comments to POLITICO on April 30, saying that all decision-making in the department must be “fact-based.”

“In USDA, we want good scientific discovery,” Perdue said, when asked about the mandated research-disclosure language. “We want peer-based evidence there. We know that research, some has been found in the past to not have been adequately peer-reviewed in a way that created wrong information, and we’re very serious when we say we’re fact-based, data-driven decision makers. That relies on sound, replicatable science rather than opinion. What I see unfortunately happening many times is that we tried to make policy decisions based on political science rather than on sound science.”

Perdue and Trump made clear in their budget request in March that they wanted to reduce the scope of the ERS, eliminating “low priority research” into such politically sensitive areas as food stamps and environmental issues.

The White House blueprint called for slashing ERS staff levels by more than 50 percent, cutting the total number of positions from about 329 to 160.

The budget is unlikely to be approved by Congress, but members of the service say they’ve already seen the effects of Trump’s and Perdue’s preferences.

“Things like conservation, rural development, food assistance, have just been de-emphasized” in favor of the administration’s preferred topics, said one economist who left ERS because of the relocation plan.

Former ERS Administrator Susan Offutt, who oversaw the service under Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, said the agency’s studies showing how USDA’s farm-subsidy programs disproportionately benefit wealthier farmers have been a “perennial irritant” to influential lobbying groups, but an “over-the-top reaction” to clamp down on such reports would be unprecedented.

“Of course, this is not the story the farm lobby wants to tell about struggling farmers,” said Offutt. “Controlling ERS would stop unflattering news about federal farm subsidies favoring high-income, high-wealth farm households from reaching the public.”

Lawmakers have complained that USDA has yet to provide a full cost-benefit analysis of its plan to move the office closer to the heartland. Republicans have increasingly supported the relocation plan, while House Democrats have filed legislation to block the move.

On Friday, the USDA announced three finalists for the new headquarters of the service and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, which is also being moved out of Washington. The finalists are Kansas City, the North Carolina research triangle region and multiple locations in Indiana.

Perdue’s office has promised to release further data justifying the move when he announces a final site recommendation this month.

Within the service, skeptical employees view the secretary’s rationale for the move and the months-long site selection process carried out by accounting firm Ernst & Young as a smokescreen.

“The message we’ve been getting is, ‘The cost-benefit analysis doesn’t matter. Being close to stakeholders doesn’t matter. The only thing that matters for you is the fact that the secretary wants you to move, thinks it’s in your best interest, and that’s what we’re doing,’” said another senior ERS economist who declined to use his name for fear of retaliation.

Brian Stacy, a former ERS economist who left in February, said he thinks the move is a way for the administration to force out staff members and reduce the size of the ERS without congressional approval.

“Part of me wonders whether this relocation is just a way to get at that staff reduction,” Stacy said, referring to the president’s budget request. “I don’t know how else to read some of the moves being made.”

ERS employees are planning to vote on unionization on Thursday.

USDA intends to keep 76 ERS employees in Washington and relocate 253 positions to the new location, USDA senior adviser Kristi Boswell told a House Appropriations panel in March.

“This is the spiraling down of the fantastic work that the ERS has done for years,” said Sonny Ramaswamy, who headed the National Institute of Food and Agriculture under the Obama and early Trump administrations. “It’s one way to drain the swamp, as it were.”

“It rejects the Administration’s unacceptable, irresponsible FY2020 requests and reaffirms strong support for reproductive health, climate change, and multilateral assistance. This bill would make strong investments that would protect our national security and repair America’s global standing and commitments.”

Trump's third annual budget request recommended dramatically reducing funds to nondefense discretionary spending, calling for the elimination of entire agencies and eliminating popular programs. Each year, Congress has resoundingly rejected the request, raising spending caps and adding to overall nondefense spending.

The proposed 2020 spending bill, which will be marked up in subcommittee on Friday, would increase the budget for the State Department and related agencies by $885.8 million as compared to current levels, add $174.2 million for United States Agency for International Development operations, and add $481.6 million for multilateral assistance through international organizations and banks.

The bill would also shift the $2.2 billion Economic Support Fund from the category of bilateral economic assistance to the category of security assistance.

The bill also includes $6.3 billion for fighting HIV/AIDS around the world, $3.3 billion in security aid to Israel, a $425 million increase for the Peace Corps, and funding for a new International Development Finance Corporation, which was created in a 2018 law.

Labor Dispute Opens New Front in Fight to Privatize the VA,http://nymag.com,['Sarah Jones'],05-08-2019,2019,5,http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/05/labor-dispute-veterans-affairs-privatization.html,"Robert Wilkie. Photo: Alex Wong/Getty Images

During his Senate confirmation hearing, Robert Wilkie, the secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs, said he wouldn’t privatize the VA’s health-care services. He’s since repeated that promise to veterans themselves. “The private sector cannot replicate VA’s expertise in things like spinal cord injury, traumatic brain injury, rehabilitative services, prosthetics, audiology, services for the blind, suicide prevention,” he told members of the American Legion in 2018.

But Wilkie was nominated by President Trump, who has surrounded himself with advocates for the privatization of the VA since taking office. His decision to fire Wilkie’s predecessor, David Shulkin, an Obama appointee who opposed privatization, may not have had as much to do with Shulkin’s alleged spending improprieties as it did with months of sustained lobbying against the secretary from allies of Concerned Veterans for America. The Koch-backed advocacy group supports an expansion of private-sector care for veterans — and Wilkie, since his confirmation, has deviated little from that goal.

On Wilkie’s watch, the VA has begun to shrink. (The VA reached out following publication to dispute this, stating: ‘Since last quarter, VA achieved a net increase of 3,043 employees and maintained a vacancy rate of approximately 11 percent.”) The department, which provides free or low-cost health care to around 9 million enrolled veterans as part of its mission to support former service members, has nearly 49,000 unfilled vacancies. Meanwhile, the Mission Act, which will expand the VA’s privatized community-care network for eligible veterans, is scheduled to take effect in June.

Now, a nascent contract dispute between the VA and the American Federation of Government Employees may bolster fears that Wilkie’s reforms are privatization in all but name. On Thursday, the VA submitted a proposal to renegotiate its collective-bargaining agreement with the AFGE, which represents around 250,000 department employees. The department’s proposals would drastically reduce the amount of time employees are allowed to spend on union business during the workday, among other changes. In a press release, the VA said it hoped to reduce staffers’ union time from 1 million hours per year to around 10,000, a change that would, it claimed, direct “more than $48 million per year” back to aiding veterans. The press release was otherwise light on detail, though in it, Secretary Wilkie described this as “a reset” of the VA’s relationship with the AFGE. “With VA facing thousands of vacancies, these proposals could add more than 1 million man-hours per year back into our work force — a vital influx of resources that would make an almost immediate difference for veterans and the employees who care for them,” Wilkie said.

These restrictions on union time would make it difficult, if not quite impossible, for staff to conduct legally permissible union business during work hours. And the VA’s plan goes even further. According to a copy of the proposal package provided by the union, the VA wants to eliminate 28 provisions of the department’s current collective-bargaining agreement. Union representatives would lose their offices inside VA facilities, and could no longer use VA equipment to carry out their duties. The department’s new contract with AFGE would last for ten years, but only the VA could make changes to it during that time; the union would be prohibited from doing the same. The VA seeks to weaken the grievance procedures set out in its previous agreement with AFGE. Communication between the union and the department would have to take place entirely at the national level. Employees who need to file grievances, for example, would no longer be able to do so at the local level. The union believes this could create a bottleneck that would slow the processing of employee grievances. The union also alleges that at least two of the VA’s proposals — to require the union to pay for the time management spends on union business, and to pay attorneys’ fees to the VA — would violate existing labor law.

Contacted for comment, VA press secretary Curt Cashour directed New York to a May 2 editorial published by Wilkie on InsideSources.com. In it, the secretary said that the department’s reforms would “make sure that the contract does not interfere with the department’s ability to take action against poor performers” and eliminate language in the previous agreement that “has effectively allowed the union to co-manage the VA.”

Asked specifically about the union’s claim that some of the proposals are illegal, Cashour said, “When department employees and attorneys — at the demand of the union — are required to cease providing medical care and support for veteran services, to prepare for and engage in union-demanded activities such as grievances, disciplinary appeals, or arbitration, it’s only fair for the union to reimburse taxpayers for this time spent not taking care of veterans.”

David Cann, AFGE’s director of field services and education, told New York on Monday that the VA’s proposals “are unique.” He added, “What I’m seeing out of the VA is the most both-barrels anti-union effort that I’ve seen in my time with AFGE.” The VA’s proposals resemble executive orders that Trump signed last May. One would have significantly reduced the amount of time that federal workers are allowed to spend on union business. AFGE sued the administration and won an injunction in August that blocked certain provisions of the orders from going forward. The Trump administration appealed the injunction, and the case is ongoing. “For whatever reason, the VA is acting in contravention of that injunction, and proposing limitations on the rights of members that are exactly the same as what the court has said they’re not allowed to do,” Cann said.

The VA’s proposal package seems to be “a clear case of failing to bargain in good faith, which is an unfair labor practice under the relevant statute,” Joseph Slater, the Eugene M. Balk professor of law and values at the University of Toledo, told New York in an email. Slater, who has reviewed a summary of the VA’s proposals, added that provisions “strike me as illegal bargaining proposals on their own,” including the provision that would allow only the VA to make changes to the contract once it’s in place. “The ten-year duration is clearly trying to lock in extreme terms for an unusually long time, which is commonly held to be bargaining in bad faith. Eliminating procedures and appropriate arrangements generally seems legally dicey to me too, as those are statutory rights,” he continued.

“I could go on,” he concluded, “but this is a set of radical, unworkable proposals that no union would agree to.”

The VA isn’t the first federal agency to call for a draconian renegotiation of its collective-bargaining agreement with AFGE. The Social Security Administration has proposed similar changes to its union contract, down to the removal of union representatives from their offices inside SSA buildings. Contract negotiations with AFGE may become not just a backdoor for the Trump administration to get around the injunction, but the locus at which its antipathy to the federal workforce meets its hostility toward unions.

The first two years of Trump’s presidency have already been difficult for the federal workforce. One of Trump’s first actions as president was to implement a temporary federal hiring freeze. He’s overseen two significant government shutdowns, the most recent of which lasted for five weeks and cost federal employees two pay periods. (Though federal workers received back pay after the government reopened, many federal contractors did not.) The VA isn’t the only federal agency facing a staffing crisis, either. Though the status of the VA’s workforce has a clear, disproportionate effect on veterans, so too does the state of the federal workforce at large. A third of federal employees are veterans. Cann told New York that AFGE believes that figure is even higher for employees of the VA.

But the fact that Wilkie is pursuing certain conflict with AFGE, instead of filling his department’s vacancies, kindles a fear specific to the VA: that the secretary intends to let the VA atrophy and funnel more and more veterans into private medical care. “If we really want to fix the VA so badly, let’s start hiring, and fill up some of those 49,000 [staff] vacancies,” Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said at a recent town hall co-sponsored by National Nurses United and CommonDefense, a progressive veterans’ advocacy group.

There’s no question that the VA suffers from systemic problems. Twenty-four veterans have died by suicide on VA campuses during the last 18 months, the Military Times reported in April. The department’s tech problems are so pronounced that implementation of the Mission Act may prove disastrous. According to ProPublica, a planned tool to help determine which veterans are eligible for private community care is so unreliable that “it threatens to disrupt the health care of about 75,000 veterans every day.” Nevertheless, a joint study from the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice and the White River Junction VA Medical Center found that VA medical facilities achieve health-care outcomes that are consistently as good as, or even better than, private alternatives in 121 regional markets. In polling, veterans themselves reliably oppose privatization, though they’re less hostile to the notion of some community-based choices as a supplement to the VA’s public services. The American Legion, like every other major veterans’ service organization, opposes privatization of the VA.

Alexander McCoy, the political director of Common Defense and a former Marine, told New York that his organization is watching the labor dispute closely. “The secretary of Veterans Affairs and Trump are trying to use veterans as props for union-busting,” he said. “This isn’t about improving our health care or fixing problems with the VA. They’re punishing workers for their own campaign to starve the VA.”

Kate Hoit, an Army veteran affiliated with VoteVets, a progressive organization that has repeatedly sued the Trump administration for its handling of the VA, agreed. “First and foremost, our concerns rest in the fact that the changes in the collective bargaining agreement will make the VA a worse place to work and therefore result in worse care for veterans,” Hoit said in a statement to New York.

Private-sector unions, too, worry that the VA’s contract proposals belie its commitment to privatization. Sara Nelson, who heads the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA and called for a general strike in response to the latest government shutdown, said that it’s “no surprise” that the Trump administration would target AFGE’s VA members, who have traditionally enjoyed a robust contract. “It’s all a direct attack on VA workers and their union,” Nelson said in a statement to New York. “Why? Because they are the ones demanding accountability at the VA, they are the ones blowing the whistle on waste and fraud, they are the ones standing in the way of privatization. That’s the ultimate goal: privatize the VA so the giant health care corporations can reap the billions spent on caring for our veterans, ignoring the fact that veterans overwhelmingly prefer the VA to private healthcare.”

AFGE will likely need all the support it can get. Slater, the law professor, cautioned that if the union wanted to file an unfair labor practices charge against the VA, it may have difficulty finding relief. Trump took until March of this year to nominate a general counsel to the U.S. Federal Labor Relations Authority, the body responsible for addressing labor grievances against federal agencies. Unions have already criticized Trump’s FLRA pick, Catherine Bird. National Treasury Employees Union president Tony Reardon told Bloomberg Law that Bird, who formerly worked in the office of general counsel for the Department of Health and Human Services, was “directly involved in the agency’s bad faith bargaining last year.” Reardon added that his union has filed four grievances against HHS for unfair labor practices. Even if Bird is confirmed, Bloomberg Law said she’ll have to process an extensive backlog of cases because the office has been vacant for two years.

Federal law also prohibits VA employees from going on strike, which further restricts AFGE’s options as it navigates contract negotiations. But Cann said that the union is considering other forms of direct action. “Getting people involved, doing petitions, doing informational rallies, applying pressure on the agency by pointing out their hypocrisy and their anti-union animus, reaching out to the handful of friends we have on the Hill, we plan on doing all of that,” he said, adding, “We’re counting on employees who care so much about the work they do as caregivers to veterans to be willing to stand up, and get involved in this campaign, and object to having their voices silenced.”

"In Rare Bipartisan Move, Reps. Adam Schiff and Devin Nunes Threaten to Subpoena DOJ for Mueller Files",https://www.thedailybeast.com,['Hanna Trudo'],05-07-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/in-rare-bipartisan-move-reps-adam-schiff-and-devin-nunes-threaten-to-subpoena-doj-for-mueller-files,"The House Intelligence Committee’s Democratic chairman and Republican ranking member are threatening to hit the Justice Department with a rare bipartisan subpoena if the department doesn’t hand over testimony and briefing materials produced by Special Counsel Robert Mueller during the Russia investigation.

In a letter dated April 25, Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA) and Ranking Member Devin Nunes (R-CA) wrote to Attorney General Bill Barr, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, and FBI Director Christopher Wray to complain that the “Department of Justice and the FBI failed to keep the Committee ‘fully and currently informed’” of foreign intelligence and counterintelligence information obtained in the course of Mueller’s investigation. Schiff and Nunes expressed concerns that the Department and Bureau also failed to the address the committee’s prior request for Mueller to testify before the committee.

“In addition to the complete unredacted report, the Committee’s request includes all classified and unclassified evidence and information obtained or generated by the Special Counsel’s Office that may relate to foreign intelligence or counterintelligence matters,” the letter states.

The request also includes information regarding “efforts by the Russian government to contact Americans in furtherance of Russian intelligence objectives,” and says it is “unique and distinct from the House Judiciary Committee’s independent interest in obtaining the unredacted report and underlying evidence.”

Schiff and Nunes set a May 2 deadline, warning that “the Committee will have no choice but to resort to compulsory process on Friday, May 3 to compel production of documents responsive to the Committee’s request” if the deadline is not met.

Reached by phone on Tuesday, Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA) told The Daily Beast that the committee has now started to proceed through the compulsory part of the process. “The extraordinary thing is that it’s bipartisan,” Khanna said.

Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-CA) told The Daily Beast the House committee’s letter was necessary because “we need to know if there’s an ongoing threat to our national security.”

“The Mueller Report found 200 pages of contacts between Donald Trump’s campaign and the Russians. But not once did it say these disturbing contacts ceased,” he said."
Steven Mnuchin Refuses to Release Trump’s Tax Documents to Congress,https://www.nytimes.com,['Alan Rappeport'],05-06-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/06/us/politics/trump-tax-returns-mnuchin.html,"WASHINGTON — The Treasury Department said on Monday that it would not release President Trump’s tax returns to Congress, defying a request from House Democrats and setting up a legal battle likely to be resolved by the Supreme Court.

Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, wrote in a letter to Representative Richard E. Neal, Democrat of Massachusetts and the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, that Mr. Neal’s request for the tax returns “lacks a legitimate legislative purpose” and that he was not authorized to disclose them. The decision came after weeks of delays as Mr. Mnuchin said that his department and the Justice Department needed to study the provision of the tax code that Democrats were using to seek six years’ worth of the president’s personal and business tax returns.

The request for Mr. Trump’s taxes is the latest instance of the Trump administration rebuffing congressional oversight efforts.

“As you have recognized, the committee’s request is unprecedented, and it presents serious constitutional questions, the resolution of which may have lasting consequences for all taxpayers,” Mr. Mnuchin wrote in the one-page letter."
Can USDA’s May Reports Overtake the Market Headlines?,https://www.agweb.com,[],,,,https://www.agweb.com/article/can-usdas-may-reports-overtake-the-market-headlines/,"An array of factors has been tugging the grain markets this month.

First, planting is significantly behind schedule—especially for corn. As of May 5, 23% of the U.S. corn crop is planted, which compares to a five-year average of 46% planted by this date. Each of the major corn-growing states are behind. Illinois corn farmers are 56 percentage points behind the average pace, at only 10% planted. Farmers in Indiana are 30 percentage points behind average and farmers in Ohio are 25 percentage points behind. Farmers in South Dakota haven’t made any progress in planting.

In soybeans, only 6% of the nation’s crop is planted, which compares to a five-year average of 14% by this date. Farmers in Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Nebraska, North Carolina and Tennessee are close to average progress or slightly ahead.

While planting is behind, the headline grabber this week was when President Donald Trump tweeted on Sunday that tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods may be raised from 10% to 25% on Friday, as trade talks between the U.S. and China progress were going ""too slowly."" Markets around the world crashed following the tweet.

Now, we’re on the eve of what is traditionally another big market mover: USDA’s May edition of the Crop Production and World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates (WASDE) reports.

“Typically, the May WASDE report is one of the biggest USDA reports of the year,” says Ted Seifried, chief market strategist and vice president with Zaner Ag Hedge Group. “This report essentially sets the baseline from which the USDA will be working from for the rest of the new marketing year.”

Granted, the balance sheet almost always looks different by the end of the year, Seifried notes. But the report provides a starting point and clues as to what changes USDA will make in the future.

The pre-report trade estimates for crop production include:

Corn: 14.841 billion bu., with an average yield of 175.3 bu./acre

Soybean: 4.1985 billion bu., with an average yield of 49.8 bu./acre

Wheat: 1.910 billion bu., of which 1.277 billion bu. will be winter wheat

Will the Bulls or Bears Rule?

“Traders are looking for bearish news,” says Joe Vaclavik, founder and president of Standard Grain. “We should see reduced old-crop demand estimates for corn and soybeans and larger carryout estimates, as a result.”

The general attitude, Vaclavik says, is that the burdensome supply situation for corn, soybeans and wheat will continue through the 2019-20 marketing year.

“If you look at some of the pre-report carryout estimates for 2019-20, they're very similar or higher to those big posted for 2018-19,” he says. “This of course assumes a fairly normal production situation in terms of yield.”

The pre-report trade estimates for ending stocks include:

Corn: 2.058 billion bu. (2018/19) and 2.132 billion bu. (2019/20)

Soybeans: 923 million bu. (2018/19) and 925 million (2019/20)

Wheat: 1.096 billion bu. (2018/19) and 1.060 billion bu. (2019/2020)

“The trade should take the 2019-20 numbers with a grain of salt,” Vaclavik says. “I think they should be more interested in revisions to old-crop demand numbers and overseas crop estimates. There will be a lot of attention paid and they report tomorrow morning.”

Will tomorrow’s report hold up to its reputation of being a key point in the marketing year? We’ll have to wait and see.

“Right now, the corn and soybean markets seem to be more fixated on the condition of the trade deal with China than anything else,” Seifried says.

California moves to ban farm pesticide that Trump's EPA has defended,https://www.cnbc.com,"['Jeff Daniels', 'Damian Dovarganes']",05-08-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/08/california-moves-to-ban-farm-pesticide-that-trumps-epa-has-defended.html,"LOS ANGELES — California regulators moved Wednesday to ban chlorpyrifos, a controversial pesticide used on almond, citrus and grape crops in the nation's largest agricultural state.

California's planned ban follows Hawaii and New York announcing similar moves against chlorpyrifos, a widely used chemical in farming that environmentalists claim is harmful to children and farmworkers.

Chlorpyrifos is manufactured by DowDuPont, which has insisted the pesticide is safe. Dow has lobbied the Trump administration to keep chlorpyrifos available for crops.

California plans to phase out the use of the pesticide statewide in a process that could take up to two years. New York lawmakers approved a ban April 30 that would end the use of chlorpyrifos in the state by 2021, while Hawaii's ban, announced last year, won't take effect until late 2022.

""California's action to cancel the registration of chlorpyrifos is needed to prevent the significant harm this pesticide causes children, farm workers and vulnerable communities,"" Jared Blumenfeld, secretary of the California Environmental Protection Agency, or CalEPA, said in a statement. ""This action also represents a historic opportunity for California to develop a new framework for alternative pest management practices.""

According to CalEPA, ""the decision to ban chlorpyrifos follows mounting evidence, including recent findings by the state's independent Scientific Review Panel on Toxic Air Contaminants, that the pesticide causes serious health effects in children and other sensitive populations at lower levels of exposure than previously understood. These effects include impaired brain and neurological development.""

In April, CalEPA regulators formally listed chlorpyrifos as a ""toxic air contaminant,"" meaning the state believed it ""may pose a present or potential hazard to human health."" It said the move was done ""to protect the health of farm workers and others living and working near where the pesticide is used.""

CalEPA said Wednesday that chlorpyrifos use has declined in California in the past decade as farmers ""have shifted to safer alternatives."" It said use of the pesticide dropped more than 50% from 2 million pounds in 2005 to just over 900,000 pounds in 2016.

In March 2017, the Trump administration moved to show its support for chlorpyrifos. Then-U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt rejected an attempt to ban the pesticide for use on food crops such as fruits, vegetables and nuts.

The largest agricultural market currently for chlorpyrifos is corn, according to the agency.

In 2016 the federal EPA, under President Barack Obama, moved to restrict use of chlorpyrifos after being petitioned by several environmental groups. Dow challenged the agency, saying its ""assessment lacks scientific vigor.""

In supporting chlorpyrifos, Dow previously has said ""growers face limited or no viable alternatives to chlorpyrifos. When an outbreak of a new pest occurs, growers look to chlorpyrifos as a proven first-line of defense.""

DowDuPont did not immediately reply to CNBC's request for comment Wednesday.

Chlorpyrifos is used in more than 90 countries. Most household uses of the chemical ended in 2000, but it has remained popular in farming."
State Department Continues Fight to Strip Gay Couple’s Two-Year-Old Son of Birthright Citizenship,https://www.thedailybeast.com,['Scott Bixby'],05-07-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/state-department-continues-fight-to-strip-gay-couples-two-year-old-son-of-birthright-citizenship,"Ever since twins Aiden and Ethan Dvash-Banks were born in Toronto in September 2016, they have shared everything—the same button nose, the same swoopy haircut, the same pug/terrier mix London. But for years, the U.S. State Department has fought an escalating legal battle to ensure that they don’t share one important thing: American citizenship.

Although Aiden and Ethan’s fathers, Andrew and Elad Dvash-Banks, have been married since 2010, only Andrew is an American citizen. While that would be enough for children in a heterosexual marriage to qualify for U.S. citizenship while born abroad, the State Department has held the Dvash-Bankses to a different standard, requiring the family to undergo DNA testing to establish that Aiden—but not Ethan—was the biological son of a U.S. citizen.

The boys’ parents sued, arguing in federal court that proving a biological connection between a child and a U.S. citizen parent isn’t required to extend birthright citizenship from a married parent to a child, and in February, the judge ruled in their favor.

“The basis for the State Department’s imposition of a biological requirement is its strained interpretation” of existing immigration law, U.S. District Judge John F. Walter wrote in a decision issued in February, dismissing the department’s attempts to institute a biological testing standard for the children of binational married couples “unilateral.”

But on Monday, the State Department appealed that decision, continuing a years-long bid to strip Ethan of his citizenship.

“Once again, the State Department is refusing to recognize Andrew and Elad’s rights as a married couple. The government’s decision to try to strip Ethan of his citizenship is unconstitutional, discriminatory, and morally reprehensible,” said Aaron C. Morris, executive director of Immigration Equality, a nonprofit that advocates for LGBT people in the immigration system. Morris successfully argued in federal court that a policy requiring genetic testing for the children of same-sex binational couples created a new double standard for citizenship: one for the children of gay couples and one for the children of straight couples.

After the Supreme Court struck down a ban on federal recognition of same-sex marriage in 2013, the Department of Homeland Security issued a guidance declaring that “just as [U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services] applies all relevant laws to determine the validity of an opposite-sex marriage, we will apply all relevant laws to determine the validity of a same-sex marriage.”

In response to a request for comment on the appeal, and on whether it plans to require DNA testing of all binational married couples in order to establish a biological relationship and thereby to establish birthright citizenship, a State Department spokesperson said that the department “does not comment on pending litigation.”

Morris also noted that in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, where the State Department has filed its appeal, the standard of using DNA testing to ensure a biological relationship between a child and a married U.S. citizen parent in order to confer citizenship has already been soundly rejected.

“This is settled law in the Ninth Circuit, which has already established that citizenship may pass from a married parent to a child regardless of whether or not they have a biological relationship,” Morris said.

Despite that precedent, Aiden and Ethan’s fathers are still deeply concerned with the State Department’s decision to appeal the case.

“We’re outraged that the State Department is so intent on harming our family and the LGBTQ community,” Andrew and Elad said in a statement. “The fight is not over, and we will not rest until our family is treated fairly and equally. Nothing can tear us apart. The four of us are unbreakable.”"
House Oversight Committee threatens salaries of Interior staff who block interviews,https://www.politico.com,"['Ben Lefebvre', 'Ryan Mccrimmon']",05-07-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/07/interior-department-salaries-threat-1414201,"Chairman Elijah Cummings also complained that the agency ""does not appear to recognize that Congress is an independent and co-equal branch of government"" that is empowered to conduct its own investigations. | Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP Photo Energy & Environment House Oversight Committee threatens salaries of Interior staff who block interviews

The House Oversight Committee on Tuesday threatened to withhold the salaries of Interior Department officials who have blocked lawmakers from interviewing agency employees about whether Secretary David Bernhardt was complying with recordkeeping laws.

The committee’s threat ratchets up the pressure on Interior in the latest skirmish between House Democrats and the Trump administration over the lawmakers' complaints that agencies are withholding documents and ignoring requests to send senior officials to testify before Congress.

Story Continued Below

“Please be advised that any official at the Department who ‘prohibits or prevents’ or ‘attempts or threatens to prohibit or prevent’ any officer or employee of the Federal Government from speaking with the Committee could have his or her salary withheld pursuant to section 713 of the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act,” Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) said in a prepared statement.

Cummings also complained in the letter to Cole Rojewski, Interior's director of congressional and legislative affairs, that the agency ""does not appear to recognize that Congress is an independent and co-equal branch of government"" that is empowered to conduct its own investigations.

Oversight has sought interviews with Interior’s administrative assistant to the deputy secretary, scheduling and advance director, executive assistant to the office of the deputy secretary and acting chief of staff and associate deputy secretary. The committee asked Interior to respond to the interview requests by Friday.

Cummings is also using the the threat of withholding salaries to force Commerce Department officials to appear before it for interviews relating plans to add citizenship questions to the 2020 Census.

In his statement, Cummings pointed to a 2016 GAO report that said a department’s budget “appropriation was not available to pay the salary of a federal officer or employee who prevents another federal officer or employee from communicating directly with any member, committee, or subcommittee of Congress.”

Oversight and the National Archives and Records Administration are investigating allegations that Bernhardt was keeping meetings off his official calendars and not supplying information about meetings to the public.

Interior refused the committee’s previous requests to interview several staffers, telling Oversight that the interviews “are unnecessary at this time,” according to a letter the committee sent to Interior today.

At a House Appropriations subcommittee hearing on the Interior Department budget on Tuesday, Bernhardt defended preventing the employees from talking to the committee, saying ""it’s not the appropriate time"" for those interviews, and that his decision was designed to protect career employees.

“You’re talking about individual employees who have long standing in the department,” he said in response to questioning from Rep. Brenda Lawrence (D-Mich.). “We have wonderful career employees here ... they’ve never had this happen to them in their careers.”

Lawrence shot back that Congress was responsible for oversight of the agency.

""You have been requested to comply. With all due to respect, you are required to comply,“ she said.

Besides refusing interviews, Interior has declined to provide documents the Oversight and House Natural Resources committees requested on March 13, according Cummings‘ letter. The department instead offered tens of thousands of pages of documents unrelated to the committee's request, the letter states.

We see the repercussions of this advancement through all aspects of society, and that extends to the top as well, where national governments continue to invest in bigger and better supercomputers. One part technological necessity and one part technological race, the exascale era of supercomputers is about to begin, as orders for the first exaFLOP-capable are now going out. It’s only fitting then that this morning the United States Department of Energy is announcing the contract for their fastest supercomputer yet, the Frontier system, which will be built by Cray and AMD.

Frontier is planned for delivery in 2021, and when it’s activated it will become the second and most powerful of the US DOE’s two planned 2021 exascale systems, with performance expected to reach 1.5 exaFLOPS. The ambitious system won’t come cheaply, however; with a price tag of over 500 million dollars for the system alone – and another 100 million dollars for R&D – Frontier is among the most expensive supercomputers ever ordered by the US Department of Energy.

The new supercomputer is being built as part of the US DOE’s CORAL-2 program for supercomputers, with Frontier scheduled to replace Oak Ridge National Laboratory’s current Summit supercomputer. Summit is the current reigning champion in the supercomputer world, with 200 petaFLOPS of performance, and accordingly the US DOE and Oak Ridge are aiming to significantly improve on its performance for the new computer. All told, Frontier should be able to deliver over 7x the performance of Summit, and is expected to be the fastest supercomputer in the world once it’s activated.

Like Summit (and Titan before it), Frontier is an open science system, meaning that it’s available to academic researchers to run simulations and experiments on. Accordingly, the lab is expecting the supercomputer to be used for a wide range of projects across numerous disciplines, including not only traditional modeling and simulation tasks, but also more data-driven techniques for artificial intelligence and data analytics. In fact the latter is a bit of new ground for the lab and the system’s eventual users; just as we’ve seen in the enterprise space over the past few years, neural network-based AI is becoming an increasingly popular technique to solve problems and extract analysis from large datasets, and now researchers are looking at how to refine those techniques from the current-generation systems and apply them to exascale-level projects.

Frontier: Powered by Cray & AMD

Officially, the prime contractor for Frontier will be Cray. But looking at the specifications, you could be excused for thinking it was AMD. Cray for its part is partnering with the chipmaker for the system, and as a result AMD is providing most of the core hardware for the new supercomputer. Designed as a next-generation CPU + accelerator system, with a mix of CPUs and GPUs doing the heavy compute work, AMD will be supplying both the CPUs and GPUs for Frontier. And as the principle processor provider, AMD will also be taking on a lot of the responsibility for developing the software stack as well, with the company working with Cray to develop an enhanced version of their ROCm environment to best extract performance from the massive cluster of CPUs and GPUs.

On the CPU side of matters, AMD will be supplying a customized next-generation EPYC CPU. AMD has confirmed that it’s going to be using a future generation of their Zen CPU cores, and given the timing of the project, we’re almost certainly looking at a Zen 3 or Zen 4 design here. Just how custom AMD’s CPU is remains to be seen, but their announcement has revealed that Frontier’s CPUs will include new instructions for the optimization of AI and supercomputing workloads.

Meanwhile on the GPU side of matters, AMD and Cray are holding their cards a little closer. Rather than naming any architecture or architectural generation, AMD is only saying that the GPUs are “based on the Radeon Instinct family” and have “yet to be announced.” AMD’s current public roadmap goes out to “Next Gen” in 2020, and with GPU development cycles averaging 2 years, this may be the architecture we see. But with the particular needs for a supercomputer, AMD may have something slightly more bespoke.

What the company is confirming for now is that they aren’t holding back on features. The HPC-focused GPU is being designed with Frontier in mind and will incorporate mixed precision compute support. Feeding the beast will be HBM memory, and AMD will be tapping a version of Infinity Fabric to connect the CPUs and GPUs.

In fact while AMD has kept the details on the technology light, it sounds like this version of IF will be the most advanced version yet. AMD is specifically noting that it’s an “incredibly” coherent fabric, calling it the first fully optimized CPU + GPU design for supercomputing. AMD’s GPUs and CPUs will be arranged in a 4-to-1 ratio, with 4 GPUs for each EPYC CPU. It’s worth noting that AMD’s slide shows a mesh with every GPU connected to the CPU and two other GPUs, but I’m not reading too much into this quite yet, as AMD hasn’t disclosed any other details on the IF setup.

With AMD going up to the blade level, tying together all of these nodes will be Cray’s job. For Frontier the supercomputer vendor is launching their new Slingshot interconnect, an equally ambitious interconnect that will support adaptive routing, congestion management, and quality-of-service features. Slingshot is capable of 200Gb/sec per port, with individual blades incorporating a port for each GPU in the blade so that other nodes can directly read and write data to a GPU’s memory. As a result Frontier will have a significant amount of interconnect bandwidth, which is all but necessary in order to allow the system to scale to exaFLOP levels.

Overall, Frontier will be organized into over 100 Cray Shasta cabinets. And while Cray has not announced a specific power consumption figure for Frontier, with each cabinet rated for 300KW, this would put the complete system at over 30MW. Which to put things in context, this is over twice the power consumption of the 13MW Summit. So while Frontier is a significantly faster system than the supercomputer it replaces, Cray, AMD, and the US DOE are all feeling the pinch of Dennard scaling slowing down, as power efficiency gains get harder to achieve. All told, in a passing comment made in the press briefing, it sounds like Oak Ridge will be installing a total of 40MW of capacity for Frontier, which is a significant amount of power to say the least.

Along with furthering the US’s own supercomputing leadership goals, securing the Frontier contract also represents big wins for Cray and AMD. Cray is now involved in both 2021 exascale systems, reinforcing their own place in the supercomputing world. Meanwhile for AMD, who is spending this current generation from the outside looking in, they have now secured a major and prestigious win for both their CPU and GPU divisions.

In fact it’s interesting to note that of the two 2021 exascale systems being ordered, both are coming from full-service processor vendors that supply both CPUs and GPUs. Current-generation systems like Summit use mixed vendors – e.g. IBM + NVIDIA – so the move to integrated vendors is a big shift for these CPU + accelerator systems. Clearly there are technological and procurement benefits to using a single vendor for all of the processors, which benefits both AMD and Intel. Though it’s worth noting that the CORAL-2 program requires the DOE to buy systems based on two different architectures, so if the future is integrated systems, then AMD and Intel are the logical choices.

At any rate, with the contract placed for Frontier, the job is only half-done. AMD and Cray will need to continue developing their hardware and software for the system, not to mention locking down the specific specifications for the finished supercomputer. So expect to continue to hear news about Frontier trickle out over the next couple of years, leading up to its installation in 2021."
Dems look to bypass EPA with asbestos ban,https://thehill.com,[],05-08-2019,2019,5,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/442716-dems-want-asbestos-ban-now-epa-says-it-needs-more-time,"House Democrats hope to sidestep the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) with a bill that would ban asbestos within a year.

In a Wednesday hearing before the Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Environment and Climate Change, Democrats grilled EPA chemical staff on why the agency hasn’t taken more restrictive actions on the harmful substance three years after passing a law to give the agency more authority to regulate dangerous chemicals.

“I wish today’s hearing wasn’t necessary and this bill wasn't necessary, but asbestos is still being imported into the U.S. and still being used in this country, and still killing about 40,000 Americans every year,” said committee Chairman Frank Pallone Jr. Frank Joseph PalloneOvernight Energy: Dems look to bypass EPA with asbestos ban | California moves to ban brain-damaging pesticide | Researchers tout new plastic as 'Holy Grail' of recycling Dems look to bypass EPA with asbestos ban Dem senators call for probe into EPA officials over memo language MORE (D-N.J.). ADVERTISEMENT

The EPA has been under heavy criticism for its latest action on asbestos, something the agency argues will limit the use of asbestos in the U.S. but critics say could reintroduce some asbestos products to the market.

The agency has resisted calls to ban the cancer-causing substance outright, even against the wishes of some of its staff, arguing it must continue to go through its risk evaluation process, even if lengthier than some might prefer.

The New York Times reported Wednesday that senior EPA officials ignored the advice of scientists and lawyers in restricting rather than banning asbestos.

“Rather than allow for (even with restrictions) any new uses for asbestos, E.P.A. should seek to ban all new uses of asbestos because the extreme harm from this chemical substance outweighs any benefit — and because there are adequate alternatives to asbestos,” staff members wrote in a memo from August.

The memo alarmed subcommittee Chairman Paul Tonko Paul David TonkoOvernight Energy: Dems look to bypass EPA with asbestos ban | California moves to ban brain-damaging pesticide | Researchers tout new plastic as 'Holy Grail' of recycling Dems look to bypass EPA with asbestos ban House votes to block Trump from exiting Paris climate accord MORE (D-N.Y.).

“Based on some of these communications it seems clear that numerous EPA career staff believe the agency is not fully pursuing efforts to reduce asbestos exposure, and I hope these expert voices have a role as the process moves forward,” he said.

Asbestos is still sometimes used in the construction of roads and production of chlorine, among other products, but more than 60 countries have banned the use of the substance or products that contain it.

“The U.S. must do the same,” argued Tonko, but “I have little confidence that EPA will move forward on a reasonable timeline with the only acceptable outcome: a complete asbestos ban.”

Congress banned asbestos in 1989 but a court overturned that law in 1991, allowing limited uses of asbestos to continue.

Committee Republicans accused Democrats of politicizing the issue, trying to sidestep a science-based EPA process that could help the agency avoid future litigation.

“Let me be honest here. If a Democrat was in the White House right now, my Democratic colleagues would be very skeptical of me trying to overturn a chemical review,” said ranking member John Shimkus John Mondy ShimkusDems look to bypass EPA with asbestos ban House votes to block Trump from exiting Paris climate accord A conservative climate plan will build on personal responsibility while reducing emissions MORE (R-Ill.).

“I’m concerned about the immediate loss of 36 percent — that’s over one third — of our national chlorine production” and the risk that would pose to hospitals and drinking water supplies, he said.

For its part, the EPA continues to stress that its rule is the first meaningful action on asbestos in 30 years.

Alexandra Dapolito Dunn, assistant administrator of the EPA’s Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention, told the committee the rule is an “aggressive and critical step” in addressing asbestos, stressing the need to go through a measured process in considering the risk factors associated with asbestos.

Dunn told The Hill in April that the agency may eventually ban asbestos.

Committee Democrats made clear they have lost faith in Dunn’s office under the Trump administration.

“Unfortunately, it’s now clear that despite the best efforts of our committee the Trump EPA is not using the tools we gave it to regulate dangerous chemicals,” Pallone Jr. said, adding that EPA’s actions “have been so legally suspect we need to pass this bill regardless of whether EPA were to announce it’s moving forward with a full ban of asbestos.”"

He acknowledged climate change is real. He acknowledged that humans are contributing to it.

So why, Democratic lawmakers asked David Bernhardt, isn't he doing more to address global warming?

Apparently, because Congress hasn't told him to.

During his first testimony to Congress since becoming interior secretary, Bernhardt said it is up to lawmakers to direct bureaucrats like himself to address the causes and effects of warming globally.

The punt back to lawmakers is likely to frustrate House Democrats who are trying to hold the administration's feet to the fire on climate change, since they know that any significant climate-related legislation to emerge from their chamber is likely to be rejected by either the president or the GOP-controlled Senate. At the same time, Democrats have only passed a single climate bill — one keeping the United States in the Paris climate accord — since taking the the majority.

The exchange came when Democrats on the House Appropriations subcommittee overseeing the Interior Department's budget pressed the Trump Cabinet official about why his department isn't doing more to assess and mitigate the effects of warming temperatures, acidifying oceans and other effects of climate change over the vast lands and waters stewarded by the Interior Department.

“Isn’t this really your job?” asked Rep. Chellie Pingree (D-Maine).

Bernhardt pushed back against the assertion, arguing he has no legal obligation to act in response to climate change. ""My perspective on this is probably a little different than yours,"" he said.

He noted that of more than 600 instances in the law mandating the interior secretary to take some action, none tell him that he ""shall,"" as is the legal parlance, manage federal lands to stop global warming.

""There's no 'shalls,' "" Bernhardt said. ""You guys come up with the 'shalls.' ""

Pingee responded by asking Bernhardt to identify any legal barriers to acting on climate change. ""If there’s something legally stopping you, then we’re Congress,” she said. ""We make the laws.""

It is a lawyerly defense Bernhardt has turned to before, including in an interview last year with The Washington Post. Yet law or no law, climate change remains a threat to the land the Interior Department is tasked with overseeing.

In the national park system alone, warming temperatures threaten to undermine the very nature of many popular tourist spots, such as by melting the glaciers of Montana's Glacier National Park and imperilling the iconic Joshua trees of California's Joshua Tree National Park.

And the department holds considerable sway of the United States' overall contributions to climate change. A U.S. Geological Survey study published last year found that a quarter of the nation's carbon dioxide emissions came from the extracting and burning of fossil fuels from federal lands.

Yet in the more than two years Donald Trump has been president, the Interior Department has sought to undo much of the previous administration's efforts to slow the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere undergirding that change.

Its action include rolling back rules designed to reduce the release of methane, a potent heat-trapping gas, from oil and natural gas wells and lifting a moratorium on new coal leasing on public lands.

During the hearing, Bernhardt said his department does not plan on easing up on oil and gas drilling on public lands when asked by Rep. Betty McCollum (D-Minn.), the subcommittee’s chairwoman, if a recent United Nations report on the possible extinction of up to 1 million species worldwide gives him pause.

""Are we going to stop oil and gas development because of this report? The answer to that is no,"" he said, again noting it is up to Congress to decide what the government does or does not allow on federal lands.

But when it came to the issue of drilling for oil and gas off the coasts of states outside the Gulf of Mexico, Bernhardt suggested he would give deference to local leaders.

""I’m not aware of a single lease that was ever developed over the opposition of a state,” he said.

The department has put on pause plans to expand offshore drilling across the U.S. continental shelf after a recent federal court ruled against the Trump administration's effort to lift a current drilling ban in the Arctic and Atlantic oceans. That decision came amid stiff opposition to offshore drilling from both Democratic and Republican politicians along the Atlantic and Pacific coasts.

POWER PLAYS

— More Interior Department drama: House Oversight and Reform Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) sent letters urging a group of current and former Trump administration officials to provide information to the committee related to ongoing investigations, threatening to withhold salaries from anyone who seeks to hamper investigations. One letter threatened the salaries of any Interior officials that try to stop lawmakers from interviewing agency staff about whether Bernhardt complied with federal record-keeping laws.

— Fed prepares for climate risks to banks: Federal Reserve Jerome Powell told lawmakers in a letter last month the central bank has aimed to “prepare financial institutions for severe weather events,” to make sure banks are resilient to climate-related risks, the Wall Street Journal reports. That echoes comments the central banker made while testifying before Congress in late February, in which he said climate-risks are mostly a matter of bank supervision and not actual monetary policy.

U.S . District Judge Haywood Gilliam of Oakland ruled the Trump administration has been illegally delaying action to limit pollutants emitted from landfills across the country, in violation of the Clean Air Act.

Who's winning in California vs. Trump? Gilliam’s ruling is just the latest in a slew of environmental cases California has brought against the administration. And the Los Angeles Times reports the state is winning in nearly all of its efforts.

— The stalemate over Puerto Rico disaster funding gets worse: And it's because of the border wall. The Trump administration is looking to add emergency border funding to a disaster aid bill, a new obstacle that has further complicated ongoing negotiations over the multibillion-dollar disaster legislation, The Post’s Erica Werner reports. An ongoing feud between the president and congressional Democrats over Puerto Rico spending has already stalled negotiations. Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard C. Shelby (R-Ala.) made a plea this week to Vice President Pence, who joined Senate Republicans for a closed-door lunch to talk about the disaster bill, that the introduction of a new spending element could tangle negotiations further.

— Starups targeting climate change struggle to rake in funding: The founder of the digital thermostat company Nest has met some obstacles in his mission to invest in start-up companies looking to tackle climate change. For one, the New York Times reports, not many venture capitalists have joined him in his quest to support such companies. Canadian company Carbon Engineering, which has been moving forward with carbon capture technology, is one company that has had success in raising money. But the Times writes the “current wave of internet-focused start-ups going public, and reaping billions of dollars for investors, has hardened the bias against so-called hard technology…In the time it took Carbon Engineering to raise one round of $68 million, Slack, a messaging company founded the same year, has raised more than 10 times as much and is now preparing for an initial public offering that could value it at nearly $20 billion.”

— Trump’s steel tariffs cost U.S. consumers $900,000 for every job created: That's according to an analysis by experts at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. “The reason it’s so high is that steel is a very capital-intensive industry. There are not many workers,” Gary Hufbauer, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute who did the cost calculation, told The Post’s Heather Long. Some Republicans and business leaders had hoped the president would have already removed the tariffs, and congressional Republicans have continued to pressure the administration to remove them “at least on Canada and Mexico, which are major feeders of metals to the United States,” Long adds.

— ""They let me go"": Hemanth Kappanna, an engineer who was part of a team of students who helped expose Volkswagen’s efforts to lie about diesel car emissions in 2013, was one of about 4,000 workers at General Motors who were recently laid off, the New York Times reports. On Tuesday, Volkswagen’s Porsche division announced it agreed to a 535 million euro, or $600 million, fine after German officials accused the car maker of selling almost 100,000 diesel SUVs with software meant to conceal excess emissions. Just a few months before, Kappanna, whose most recent role at G.M. was to communicate with the EPA about the company’s emissions technology, was called into a conference room to be let go. He received a severance package with two months of pay and a one-way ticket to India, where he returned soon after because he couldn’t find work before his 60-day grace period expired.

The House Judiciary Committee will proceed with a vote to hold Attorney General William Barr in contempt of Congress on Wednesday, Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) confirmed late Monday, as the Justice Department attempts to fend off the effort ahead of a negotiating session with the Democratic-led committee on Tuesday.

Nadler's firm stance comes as he seeks punitive actions against the attorney general for defying a subpoena for special counsel Robert Mueller’s unredacted report on the Russia investigation and its underlying evidence. It also comes hours after the Justice Department put forward a last-ditch plea to negotiate with the panel, offering a Wednesday meeting but later agreeing to Nadler’s demand for a Tuesday sit-down.

Story Continued Below

“At the moment, our plans to consider holding Attorney General Barr accountable for his failure to comply with our subpoena still stand,” Nadler said in a statement. “My hope is that we make concrete progress at tomorrow’s meeting towards resolving this dispute. The committee remains committed to finding a reasonable accommodation.”

In a letter to Nadler earlier Monday, Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd invited the chairman to a negotiation session on Wednesday to discuss an “acceptable accommodation” that would potentially give more lawmakers access to a less-redacted version of the report, in addition to “possible disclosure of certain materials” cited in Mueller’s report.

Boyd’s letter came hours after the committee took its first formal step toward holding Barr in contempt of Congress for defying the panel’s subpoena for Mueller's unredacted report on Russian interference in the 2016 election, when Nadler announced that it planned to consider a contempt citation against Barr on Wednesday morning.

A vote of approval from the Democrat-led committee would send the measure to the full House for consideration later this month. Nadler said he would put the contempt proceedings on hold if the Justice Department engages in a “good-faith” effort to give Democrats access to the requested information.

“The attorney general’s failure to comply with our subpoena, after extensive accommodation efforts, leaves us no choice but to initiate contempt proceedings in order to enforce the subpoena and access the full, unredacted report,” Nadler said in a statement before the DOJ released its letter.

Democrats have argued that the redacted version Barr made public last month is insufficient to consider a potential congressional response to Mueller's findings, particularly his evidence that President Donald Trump attempted to thwart the investigation.

The committee launched its own obstruction of justice investigation against the president earlier this year. The contempt citation explicitly mentions that probe, which is also centered on allegations of “public corruption and other abuses of power” by the president.

“Attorney General Barr failed to comply with the committee’s request for these documents and thereby has hindered the committee’s constitutional, oversight, and legislative functions,” the citation states.

The contempt citation also references the Justice Department’s long-standing policy against indicting a sitting president, noting that Mueller accepted those guidelines in declining to charge Trump with obstruction of justice.

“Congress is therefore the only body able to hold the president to account for improper conduct in our tripartite system, and urgently requires the subpoenaed material to determine whether and how to proceed with its constitutional duty to provide checks and balances on the president and executive branch,” the citation states. “Otherwise, the president remains insulated from legal consequences and sits above the law.”

The Justice Department said last week it would not comply with the committee’s subpoena for the unredacted report and the underlying evidence, arguing that it amounts to illegitimate congressional oversight. Nadler gave Barr until Monday morning to respond to an augmented offer; the Justice Department did not respond to that offer, and has maintained that it would be violating the law if it complied with the Democrats’ request.

Boyd slammed Nadler for refusing to view the less-redacted version of Mueller’s report, which still includes redactions of grand-jury information. Boyd said Nadler’s refusal “naturally raises questions about the sincerity of the committee’s interest in and purported need for the redacted material.”

All six House and Senate Democrats declined to read the less-redacted version of the report offered to a select group of senior lawmakers, arguing that the offer should have included dozens more members of the committees investigating matters connected to Mueller's findings.

In response to the formal contempt notice on Monday, the committee’s top Republican, Rep. Doug Collins of Georgia, called Nadler’s move “illogical and disingenuous” because the Justice Department is still negotiating with the panel.

“Democrats have launched a proxy war smearing the attorney general when their anger actually lies with the president and the special counsel, who found neither conspiracy nor obstruction,” Collins said in a statement.

Democrats have been demanding Mueller's complete report and underlying evidence for months, a call that intensified after Mueller submitted his findings to Barr in late March. But Barr held on to the report for a month while he reviewed and redacted it for several categories of sensitive information. The public version of the report he released contained limited redactions but included none of Mueller's underlying material — evidence Democrats say they need to determine whether Trump committed impeachable offenses.

Though Mueller concluded that he lacked sufficient evidence to prove any Americans aided the vast Russian effort to interfere in the 2016 election, he described repeated efforts by Trump to sideline the investigation altogether and to encourage witnesses to refrain from full cooperation.

Mueller did not formally conclude that Trump obstructed justice — a determination he said was largely a result of the DOJ restrictions against indicting a sitting president — but Barr has since used Mueller's evidence to absolve Trump of the potential crime.

Barr testified for five hours to the Senate Judiciary Committee last week and described sharp disagreements with the legal theories undergirding Mueller's findings — including whether Trump's tweets can be persuasive evidence of obstruction and suggesting Mueller told him privately, despite not indicating it in his report, that his obstruction decision was not based on the longstanding DOJ restriction.

Barr skipped a hearing House Democrats had called last Thursday after his aides objected to Democrats' request to allow committee lawyers from both parties to question Barr for 30 minutes each. Democrats previously authorized Nadler to subpoena Barr a second time to compel his appearance before their committee, though he hasn't issued it yet.

The impact of a contempt citation could be simply symbolic. Republicans held Barack Obama’s attorney general, Eric Holder, in contempt of Congress for failing to turn over documents. Some Democrats have floated the possibility of using punitive enforcement mechanisms against Barr for defying their subpoena, including levying fines against the attorney general.

U.S. Department of Labor cites Spirit Aerosystems for exposing employees to carcinogen,https://www.ksn.com,[],05-08-2019,2019,5,https://www.ksn.com/news/kansas/us-department-of-labor-cites-spirit-aerosystems-for-exposing-employees-to-carcinogen/1989850964,"WICHITA, Kan. (KSNW) - The U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration has cited Spirit Aerosystems for exposing employees to carcinogen hazards. The company faces penalties of $193,218 for two repeated and four serious violations.

OSHA alleges the company failed to implement feasible engineering controls to limit employee exposure to hexavalent chromium, a known carcinogen, and conduct periodic monitoring of employee exposure. OSHA also alleges the company failed to establish protocols to ensure that employees remove contaminated personal protective equipment and clothing before leaving the work area.

OSHA also alleges the company failed to prevent exposure to hexavalent chromium during aircraft painting and allowed the accumulation of hexavalent chromium on surfaces and failed to ensure that employee respirators fit properly.

""Inhaling excessive levels of hexavalent chromium can cause asthma, and damage to the kidneys, liver, and respiratory system,"" said OSHA Wichita Acting Area Office Director Ryan Hodge. ""It is important for employers to take the appropriate steps necessary to prevent excessive exposure.""

The company has 15 business days from receipt of the citations and penalties to comply, request an informal conference with OSHA's area director, or contest the findings before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission.

"House, DOJ On Verge of Settling 7-Year Fast and Furious Legal Battle",https://www.usnews.com,[],05-09-2019,2019,5,https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2019-05-09/house-justice-department-announce-settlement-in-7-year-fast-and-furious-fight,"A seven-year legal battle over the Justice Department's refusal to comply with a congressional subpoena that led the House to hold then-Attorney General in contempt appears to be nearing its end.

The department announced in a press release that it reached a settlement with a House committee in a long-running standoff over documents related to Operation Fast and Furious. The Obama-era gun-running investigation, a sting operation overseen by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, had allowed illegal sales of as many as 2,000 firearms. Many of the weapons ended up in the hands of Mexican drug cartels, and one was used in the killing of a U.S. Border Patrol agent.

The bungled operation sparked outrage on Capitol Hill. Republicans accused the Justice Department of a cover-up and of concealing crucial details of its investigation. Attorney General Eric Holder conceded to lawmakers that the operation was ""fundamentally flawed"" but insisted he had been truthful during congressional testimony and his agency had been forthcoming in disclosing its findings.

A protracted fight ensued over documents related to the investigation, with lawmakers pushing the Justice Department to hand over more materials. In a tentative settlement last fall, the agency agreed to produce more documents and conduct a new search for emails. However, the federal judge overseeing the legal fight threw out that agreement on other grounds, and the settlement announced Wednesday promises simply to end the dispute without any further production of materials.

The agreement, reached in April, still requires the judge's sign-off to be approved. And a release of documents – even a decade after the operation began – still has the potential to roil a political environment in which President Donald Trump frequently lobs criticisms at his predecessor and border issues remain hotly contested.

The settlement was announced hours after Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee voted to hold Attorney General William Barr in contempt for refusing to comply with a subpoena for documents related to special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation. It seeks to resolve a fight between the legislative and executive branches that not only mirrors the Mueller battle enveloping the nation's capital this week but signals just how long it may be before lawmakers and the Justice Department find a resolution.

In 2012, the House oversight committee, then led by Republicans ultimately issued a subpoena when Holder declined to hand a range of documents related to the Fast and Furious operation. After the attorney general refused to comply with the subpoena, the committee voted to hold him in contempt.

The two sides initially reached a settlement over the documents last year after Trump was elected and Jeff Sessions was attorney general, but U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson, who has overseen the multiyear case, refused to approve the agreement.

""The only real change in circumstance since the filing of the appeal has been the change in political leadership at the Department of Justice in the wake of the Presidential election. This suggests that the primary, if not the sole, objective of the conditional settlement and the pending motion is to erase the Court's prior rulings,"" Jackson, an Obama appointee, wrote at the time.

The prior rulings, made previously in the case in 2014 and 2016, could also be key going forward because they include a nonbinding but potentially influential conclusion that federal courts have the authority to weigh in on disagreements on access to records and testimony between lawmakers and the executive branch."
"EPA to continue lead testing at Western NY homes, part of $7M cleanup plan",https://www.newyorkupstate.com,"['Tribune Media', 'Webcomments Siadvance.Com', 'Tribune Media Services']",05-09-2019,2019,5,https://www.newyorkupstate.com/news/2019/05/epa-to-continue-lead-testing-in-western-ny-homes-part-of-7m-cleanup-plan.html,"The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency will spend the summer continuing testing at 28 homes in Lockport’s Lowertown where lead contamination was found previously in subsurface soils.

After a project update before the Common Council Wednesday, project manager Julio Vazquez said the agency is now hoping to complete its work design plan by Sept. 30, a schedule that is likely to push remedial work into 2020.

Last August, EPA officials said they had hoped to complete the work design plan by this spring, and begin work removing lead-contaminated soil by this summer.

The $7 million cleanup plan will involve removing 14,000 cubic yards of lead-contaminated soil from affected residences on Mill, Chapel, Porter, North Adam and Frost streets. The soil will be trucked to an off-site facility licensed to handle the waste, and the excavated areas will then be restored with clean soil.

""We definitely intend to get this job done as soon as we can,"" said EPA spokesman Michael Basile.

Basile said they were hopeful they could finish the work design plan by this spring, but encountered various delays. Harsh winter weather temporarily delayed testing, as did the 35-day, partial shutdown of the federal government in December and January.

While EPA officials are similarly optimistic they can stick with the current estimated schedule, they acknowledge other delays could push the soil removal back further.

The agency could discover more widespread contamination in the affected areas, necessitating a more complex work design plan. Or the agency could have challenges securing funding for the work.

The Superfund program typically requires polluters to fund the cleanups. However, Basile said Eighteen Mile Creek has a history of industrial use that dates back to the 1800s and includes dozens of industrial facilities, deeply complicating efforts to identify responsible parties.

Instead, EPA officials on the Eighteen Mile Creek cleanup will have to compete against other projects for limited funding.

But they say residents in the affected home should not be concerned about the delay in the cleanup.

Remedial Project Manager Jaclyn Kondrk said the lead contamination was primarily found in sub-surface soils, and thus, does not post an immediate risk to those residents. When the EPA identifies immediate risks, she said, it launches an emergency cleanup.

""This isn't an immediate exposure issue. It's a long-term exposure issue,"" said Kondrk, who is managing phases of the creek cleanup that are not related to the lead-contaminated homes.

During the August community meeting, EPA officials suggested residents in the affected homes take steps to limit their risk of lead exposure. These include refraining from gardening, more frequently bathing outdoor pets (particularly their paw pads) and cleaning their floors of dirt more regularly.

Kondrk said Wednesday the agency made these recommendations ""out of an abundance of caution.""

Kondrk also said the testing over the summer will go to depths of 4 feet, deeper than previous testing, to ensure lead contamination is not present in those deeper soils. Even so, past testing found most of the contaminants were less than 18 inches deep.

The agency said it did not find contaminants other than lead in those areas.

Meanwhile, the EPA is continuing testing in the creek itself for the second and third phases of the cleanup, which are likely to go on for years.

The agency finalized its plans for the second phase cleanup in January 2017. That $23 million project calls for dredging contaminated sediments at the former United Paperboard Company property, 62 to 70 Mill St.; the White Transportation property, 30 to 40 Mill St.; Upson Park; former residential parcels on Water Street; and near the dilapidated Clinton and William Street dams, which will be removed. The former Flintkote Plant property, 198 and 300 Mill St., will undergo dredging and capping.

The first phase, which was completed in May 2016, included the removal of the former Flintkote building and the relocation of five families on Water Street because creek waters regularly flooded and recontaminated the properties.

The third phase of the cleanup will cover a 14-mile stretch from Harwood Street to Lake Ontario.

Kondrk said that work is proceeding ""pretty much on schedule.""

DOJ to Ask White House to Invoke Privilege Over Entire Mueller Report,https://www.thedailybeast.com,['Erin Banco'],05-08-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/doj-to-ask-white-house-to-invoke-privilege-over-entire-mueller-report,"The House Judiciary Committee still plans to hold a markup session Wednesday morning to hold Attorney General Bill Barr in contempt for ignoring a subpoena to release to members the full, unredacted Mueller report, according to a senior Democratic aide.

The Department of Justice plans to ask the White House to invoke privilege over the report if the committee moves forward with the markup session , that aide said.

The news comes after staffers with the department and the committee met Tuesday afternoon in an attempt to come to an agreement about the release of the redacted report. But the two sides, after weeks of negotiations, have once again failed to come to an understanding.

“Tonight, in the middle of good faith negotiations with the Attorney General, the Department abruptly announced that it would instead ask President Trump to invoke executive privilege on all of the materials subject to our subpoena,"" House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler said in a statement. “This kind of obstruction is dangerous. The Department’s decision reflects President Trump’s blanket defiance of Congress’s constitutionally mandated duties. In the coming days, I expect that Congress will have no choice but to confront the behavior of this lawless Administration.”

In a letter to the committee, the DOJ said that it had offered the committee multiple accommodations throughout Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation. Despite those accommodations, the committee has responded with “unreasonable demands and scheduling a committee vote to recommend that the Attorney General be held in contempt of Congress,” the letter said.

“In the face of the Committee’s threatened contempt vote, the Attorney General will be compelled to request that the President invoke executive privilege with respect to the materials subject to the subpoena.”

The DOJ asked the committee to delay any vote on whether to recommend a citation of contempt for noncompliance with the subpoena.

But the judiciary committee still plans to move forward with the markup session, raising the chances that the fighting between DOJ and the Hill over the report will turn into an all-out brawl.

“ The judiciary committee still plans to move forward with the markup session, raising the chances that the fighting between DOJ and the Hill over the report will turn into an all-out brawl. ”

Barr also failed to show up for a hearing in front of the committee last week. The DOJ said the committee had made unreasonable demands about the format of the hearing, including that staff attorneys question Barr.

In the meeting between the two sides Wednesday afternoon, the DOJ said it would give more committee members the chance to view a less-redacted version of the now public Mueller report. But judiciary said that all members should have access to that version and each side of the committee should also be able to share it with three staffers. The Judiciary also asked that the DOJ either work with the committee on going to court or to not oppose it going to court to seek grand jury material related to the Mueller report."
Reality Check: Can You Be Too Old To Be President? – WCCO,https://minnesota.cbslocal.com,[],05-08-2019,2019,5,https://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2019/05/08/reality-check-can-you-be-too-old-to-be-president/,"



— There’s a wide open field of new, young presidential candidates for 2020. But the current frontrunners are the oldest candidates in the race.

The United States Constitution requires presidents to be at least 35 years old, but there is no top age limit.

“I’m so young, I can’t believe it. I’m the youngest person. I am a young, vibrant man,” said President Donald Trump.

The three oldest candidates in the race are living in their eighth decade. President Trump (72), Joe Biden (76) and Bernie Sanders (77). It is sparking old-age jokes on late night TV.

“But I’ve already gotten support from Metamucil, white untouched sneakers, and those tennis balls you put on the bottom of walkers,” said “The Tonight Show” host Jimmy Fallon as Bernie Sanders.

It’s a common political question: How old is too old? A recent Wall Street Journal poll found voters rank older candidates very low on the list of people they’re comfortable voting for.

In top to bottom order, voters are most comfortable with a candidate who is:

A white man (86%)

A woman (84%)

Gay or lesbian (68%)

A business executive (56%)

A Muslim (49%)

Someone over 75 years old (37%)

Age and mental fitness was a campaign issue in 1984, when 73-year-old Ronald Reagan ran for a second term against his 56-year-old Democratic challenger, Walter Mondale.

“I will not make age an issue of this campaign. I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent’s youth and inexperience,” Reagan said.

In fact, it is against the law to discriminate against hiring or firing workers because of age. But most Americans think age 70 is too old to work, and 75 is too old to be president. But it’s false that septuagenarian cognitive abilities are diminished.

Trump is the oldest president to assume office at the age of 70. Theodore Roosevelt was the youngest, at age 42."
Shareholders Demand To Know How Northrop Grumman Will Protect Human Rights While Building Massive DHS Database,https://www.eff.org,"['Jason Kelley', 'Jyoti Panday']",05-08-2019,2019,5,https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/05/shareholders-northrop-grumman-demand-know-how-company-will-protect-human-rights,"Over the next few years, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) plans to implement an enormous biometric collection program which will endanger the rights of citizens and foreigners alike. The agency intends to collect at least seven types of biometric identifiers, including face and voice data, DNA, scars, and tattoos, often from questionable sources, and from innocent people.

But DHS isn’t building all of the technology: Northrop Grumman, a defense contractor, won the nearly 100 million-dollar, 42-month contract to “develop increments one and two” of the project, named HART (Homeland Advanced Recognition Technology). Now, a group of concerned investors are demanding that the Board of Directors of the company explain how they will protect human rights while building the tech behind the massive, privacy-invasive database.

It’s unsurprising that shareholders are recognizing the serious harm to civil and human rights the company will be linked to through its work on this project.

The Tri-State Coalition for Responsible Investment (Tri-CRI) filed the shareholder resolution in November after discussions with company management failed. The resolution asks the board to explain how the company will abide by its human rights policy, which reflects the U.N.’s Universal Declaration of Human Rights, while building a database that will greatly expand DHS’s ability to surveil innocent people. Their fears are well-founded: as EFF reported, HART will chill and deter people from exercising their First Amendment protected rights to speak, assemble, and associate—all rights also recognized under the UN’s Declaration of Human Rights, and presumably, by Northrop Grumman’s policy. If it is serious about its commitment to human rights, the shareholders say, the company must step up and explain how it squares that commitment with the harms inherent in this project. Voting on the resolution will take place May 15.

According to Northrop Grumman’s press release, “HART will offer a more accurate, robust way to identify adversaries” using “advanced, proven technologies.” But far from being proven or accurate, face recognition—one of the first components of HART to be built, and which DHS intends to rely on to identify people across a variety of its mission areas—has a high rate of inaccuracy, even according to DHS’s tests of its own systems, and is known to misidentify people of color and women at higher rates than others. In their shareholder resolution, Tri-CRI lay this out in addition to other harms posed by the technology:

There are concerns that the algorithms used to identify facial images that may be stored in the database have inherent racial bias. The HART database will amplify the surveillance capabilities of government agencies, presenting risks to privacy and First Amendment rights and causing harm to immigrant communities. Through the provision of services through the DHS contract, Northrop Grumman may be linked or contribute to these adverse human rights impacts.

Shareholders aren’t alone in their concerns with this technology: a coalition of over 85 groups across a spectrum of civil society recently demanded that other companies, including Amazon, Microsoft, and Google halt all governmental sales of face recognition technology. Amazon faces similar shareholder action later this month. And the pushback isn’t just coming from advocacy groups. Senators have asked DHS to pause at least one aspect of the HART program—the use of facial recognition in airports—until a proper rulemaking. The OIG is investigating the proposal as well, to “assess whether biometric data collected at pilot locations has improved DHS's ability to verify departures.” The Government Accountability Office has criticized the reliability of DHS’s data, and Congress even withheld funds in previous years from DHS’s Office of Biometric Identity Management. Even major cities, including San Francisco and Oakland, are considering permanent bans on any city department utilizing facial recognition technology—an indicator of how dangerous the technology is.

Facial recognition isn’t the only problem with HART. EFF filed comments criticizing DHS’s plan to collect, store, and share the biometric and biographic records it receives from external agencies, and to exempt this information from the federal Privacy Act, making it difficult if not impossible for individuals to review the data collected. In addition, the broad, vague scope of DHS’s proposal makes it exceedingly difficult for the American public to track and comment on the over-collection and overuse of biometric data.

Other data DHS is planning to collect—including information about people’s “relationship patterns” and from officer “encounters” with the public—can be used to identify political affiliations, religious activities, and familial and friendly relationships. These data points are also frequently colored by conjecture and bias. This, combined with the fact that the biometric data will be shared with federal agencies outside of DHS, as well as state and local law enforcement and foreign governments, poses a very real threat to First Amendment-protected activities. DHS must do more to minimize the threats to privacy and civil liberties posed by this vast new trove of highly sensitive personal data—and Northrop Grumman should look carefully at these and other criticisms when responding to shareholders’ concerns.

DHS’s legacy IDENT fingerprint database, which HART builds off of, contains information on 220-million unique individuals—an enormous increase from 20 years ago when IDENT only contained information on 1.8-million people. Between IDENT and other DHS-managed databases, the agency already manages over 10-billion biographic records and adds 10-15 million more each week. Northrop Grumman is set to help the agency—which includes the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), Customs and Border Protection (CBP), and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)—expand the scope of this unimaginably vast data trove exponentially, with new, questionable data sources gathered from ineffective and dangerous technology.

Private companies aren’t subject to the same pressure as elected officials and government agencies, but it’s unsurprising that shareholders are recognizing the serious harm to civil and human rights the company will be linked to through its work on this project. Transparency is often the first step towards accountability, and we are glad to see shareholders holding the company to account, and pressing it to publicly report how it applies its human rights policy to its work building technology that endangers human rights.

Baton Rouge doesn’t make short list for USDA relocation sites,https://www.businessreport.com,['Annie Ourso Landry'],05-09-2019,2019,5,https://www.businessreport.com/newsletters/baton-rouge-doesnt-make-short-list-for-usda-relocation-sites,"The U.S. Department of Agriculture released a short list of three sites still in the running for the relocation of two USDA research agencies, and Baton Rouge, which made the middle list, did not survive the second round of cuts.

The top three relocation sites include the Greater Kansas City Region, the Research Triangle of North Carolina and multiple locations in Indiana, according to the USDA. Two other sites—St. Louis, Missouri, and Madison, Wisconsin—are also still under consideration if the first three sites do not work out.

Baton Rouge was one of 136 sites from 35 states that submitted bids for the relocation of the two USDA offices—the Economic Research Service and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture—out of Washington, D.C., which was announced last August.

Louisiana’s Capital City survived the first round of cuts announced in March, when the USDA culled the list down to 67 potential sites in 28 states.

Baton Rouge’s application was submitted through the Baton Rouge Area Chamber, in partnership with Louisiana Economic Development, Baton Rouge Area Foundation, Louisiana Department of Agriculture & Forestry, LSU and Southern University.

The USDA narrowed the final list based on criteria such as quality of life, diversity, housing costs, health care access, workforce population and growth, the unemployment rate, logistics and IT infrastructure, such as proximity to customers and airport accessibility.

Despite receiving no official reason why Baton Rouge was cut from the running, BRAC expects it may be because of population size and air travel accessibility.

“While we haven’t received formal rationale on the culling, our initial internal review points to the three selected markets having a larger MSA population and a perception of easier access to air service,” says BRAC spokeswoman Kelly Bienn. “Outside of those two points, we feel that Baton Rouge has similar asset strengths to the selected markets.”

The ERS and NIFA relocations, which are part of a broader USDA reorganization, will involve relocating most federal workers at those agencies to the new locations."
Pompeo abruptly cancels trip to Germany,https://www.cnn.com,"['Devan Cole', 'Nicole Gaouette']",05-07-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/07/politics/mike-pompeo-cancels-trip/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Secretary of State Mike Pompeo abruptly canceled a scheduled trip to Germany, where he was planning to meet with Chancellor Angela Merkel ""due to pressing issues,"" the State Department said early Tuesday.

No specific reason was given for the cancellation. The press pool traveling with Pompeo has not been told where they are going next, and have been warned they may not be able to report from the country they are going to until after their departure.

""Unfortunately, we must reschedule the Berlin meetings due to pressing issues. We look forward to rescheduling this important set of meetings. The Secretary looks forward to being in Berlin soon,"" State Department spokesperson Morgan Ortagus said, according to the press pool traveling with Pompeo.

The sudden schedule change comes two days after the Pentagon deployed a carrier and a bomber task force to the Middle East, in response to ""specific and credible"" intelligence that suggested Iranian forces and proxies were planning to target US forces in Syria, Iraq and at sea.

The carrier group has been ordered to Strait of Hormuz in order to send a deterrent message to Iran, US officials said Sunday. The move is likely to heighten tensions as Tehran explicitly warned the US in April against any moves to block or interfere with the Strait. The 21-mile-wide waterway separates Iran from other Gulf countries and is a crucial conduit for the global economy, with 30% of the world's crude oil passing through it.

Microsoft and VA team up to help disabled veterans play video games,https://rebootcamp.militarytimes.com,['Joshua Axelrod'],05-08-2019,2019,5,https://rebootcamp.militarytimes.com/news/transition/2019/05/08/microsoft-and-va-team-up-to-help-disabled-veterans-play-video-games/,"Disabled veteran gamers are in for a treat thanks to a recent partnership between Microsoft and the Department of Veterans Affairs.

The Xbox adaptive controller was created so veterans with disabilities and others can play “Halo,” “Kingdom Hearts 3” or whatever games they’re into just as everyone else can.

“It’s a very different approach to a game controller from what I think people conceptualize a game controller to be,” said Bryce Johnson, the inclusive lead at Microsoft Devices. “This is not one-size fits all; this is the opposite of that. You can use this thing to adapt to you.”

Rebootcamp Recommendations

While the controller is currently available to buy, Microsoft donated controllers, consoles, games and other adaptive gaming equipment to 22 VA rehab centers around the country. Veterans can use the controllers for free at facilities in Washington, D.C., Texas, Alabama, Ohio, Tennessee, Minnesota, Virginia, Missouri, Florida, Colorado, New York and California.

The idea for the adaptive controller was born during the 2015 edition of Microsoft’s annual hackathon, according to Johnson. That’s when Johnson and his Microsoft colleagues met Sgt. Josh Price, who had lost his right arm from his elbow down.

Johnson recalled watching Price use a customized Xbox controller created by Ken Jones, founder of the nonprofit Warfighter Engaged, which is dedicated to coming up with innovative ways for the disabled to enjoy gaming.

“It was super important for us to see it because we had to recognize what people were going through to play games and how much they were willing to do,” Johnson said.

After developing their own adaptive controller, Microsoft approached the VA to make sure veterans had access to it at their facilities.

“The options for video-gaming have been relatively limited,” said Dr. Leif Nelson, the VA’s director of national veterans sports programs and special events. “That’s what’s exciting about this: It’s another option for us to open up the world of esports.”

Jones has been working in adaptive gaming since 2012, when he began to use his engineering skills to create custom controllers for specific disabilities upon request. He eventually turned those projects into Warfighter Engaged, and he was delighted to work with Microsoft on their Xbox adaptive controller.

He said that Xbox controllers can be modified to “do just about anything,” which makes adapting them for veterans’ individual needs fairly simple.

“So it’s about as universal as you’re possibly going to get,” Jones said. “It’s basically a dream come true for people who modify controllers and for people who need it.”

Gaming is also a therapeutic tool for veterans, both physically and mentally, Jones said. That’s why making it easier for veterans to play, through innovations like the Xbox adaptive controller, is a big deal.

“There is some physical therapy going on there,” he said. “It’s moving your muscles around. But a lot of it is cognitive therapy decision-making. It’s just a way of relaxing and doing something that you wanted to do before.”

Nelson, who is a doctor of physical therapy, said gaming can also help veterans avoid isolation.

“It’s a community now and a way to socially engage and interact,” Nelson said. “And that’s what we’re trying to do with our veterans.”

That element of gaming was vital for Dave Crouse, a Marine Corps veteran and director of veterans services at video-game nonprofit Stack Up. He said that the military lifestyle while deployed is a lot of “hurry up and wait,” and many of those extra hours are spent playing video games.

Crouse served from 2003 to 2014 and specialized in explosive ordnance disposal. He lost his left hand and left eye during an operation in Cambodia in 2013, so he knows exactly how crucial video games can be for a veteran’s recovery and how useful something like the Xbox adaptive controller can be for that purpose.

”For me, it is the perfect form of escapism,” he said. “It engages me mentally and physically, and it gives me this cool escape, whether it’s just to decompress or to put some distance between me and the challenges I’m facing.”

There are many ways for veterans to deal with the lingering effects of PTSD, from motorcycle-riding to extreme sports. The best method for Crouse has been playing video games, and products like the Xbox adaptive controller give him and many others the means to continue participating in an activity they love."

Obama DHS secretary pulls out of commencement speech after opposition to immigration policies: report,https://thehill.com,[],05-08-2019,2019,5,https://thehill.com/latino/442682-obama-dhs-secretary-pulls-out-of-usc-commencement-speech-after-opposition-to,"Former Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson has reportedly withdrawn as commencement speaker for the University of Southern California’s (USC) law school, citing concerns about his enforcement of the Obama administration’s immigration policy.

""I informed Secretary Johnson that some faculty and students have raised concerns about the immigration policies of the Obama administration and, therefore, about having him as our commencement speaker,” Dean Andrew Guzman said in an email to faculty and staff, according to Inside Higher Ed. “Secretary Johnson shared with me that he believes that graduations should be free of tension and political controversy and for this reason has decided not to speak.”

Johnson served as head of the Department of Homeland Security from December 2013 through the end of former President Obama’s second term.

In April, two Chicano professors at USC's Gould School of Law wrote to express disappointment with Johnson’s invitation, noting his part in the detention of migrants fleeing an uptick in violence in Central America in 2014, as well as his arguments against judicial review of “kill lists” of combatants when he served as general counsel for the Department of Defense.

""USC’s choice to invite Secretary Johnson to speak normalizes illegal state violence. Inviting him to speak to the graduating class legitimates what federal courts and lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have recognized as a fundamental betrayal of core values,” wrote professors Daria Roithmayr and David B. Cruz. “Johnson has repeatedly failed to respect legal and moral limits on the use of government-sponsored coercive force, particularly against children, and has demonstrated a morally repugnant willingness to use those who are most vulnerable among us as means to an end."""

LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has postponed his visit to Greenland because he needs to return to Washington, the State Department said on Thursday.

“Secretary Pompeo must postpone his visit to Greenland due to a need for the secretary to be in Washington, D.C., today,” spokeswoman Mortgan Ortagus said.

Pompeo had been due to visit Greenland on Thursday, but left London bound for Washington instead.

U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday imposed new sanctions on Iran, targeting revenue from its exports of industrial metals, the latest salvo in tensions between Washington and Tehran over a 2015 international accord curbing the Islamic Republic’s nuclear program.

Pompeo told Britain on Wednesday it needed to change its attitude towards China and telecoms company Huawei, casting the world’s second largest economy as a threat to the West similar to that once posed by the Soviet Union."
Justice Department releases redacted Mueller report — again,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-07-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/justice-department-releases-redacted-mueller-report-again,"The Justice Department released a second copy of special counsel Robert Mueller’s report on Monday evening, following a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit filed by BuzzFeed and the Electronic Privacy and Information Center.

The lightly-redacted version of Mueller's report appears to be identical to the 448-page document that was released in April, except it sheds more light on the redactions by explaining why the blacked-out information is exempted from release under FOIA.

Democrats in Congress are threatening to hold Attorney General William Barr in contempt for declining to provide them with an unredacted version of the report, and this successful move by BuzzFeed and EPIC may make it easier for their battle for the full report to move forward in federal court.

Along with the report itself, the Justice Department included a letter from senior counsel Vanessa Brinkman addressed to BuzzFeed reporter Jason Leopold, who had filed a FOIA request for the report back on March 21, 2019. Brinkman said the Office of Information Policy had processed the Mueller report under FOIA and had made it available on the Justice Department website. Brinkman also said she had “determined that the Report is appropriate for release with excisions” and listed the different reasons for redactions, including exemptions related to: protecting sources and methods, safeguarding law enforcement techniques, shielding ongoing law enforcement proceedings, keeping grand jury testimony confidential, ensuring deliberative process privilege, avoiding invasions of privacy, and ensuring a fair trial.

One example of how the latest version of Mueller's report adds a bit more clarity to the redaction process can be seen by comparing the short overview section on “Russian Hacking Operations” early in the document. In the originally released version, a few lines in the WikiLeaks section are said to be redacted due to “Harm to Ongoing Matter.” But in the version released Monday, DOJ explains those sentences are blacked out due to exemptions “(b)(6), (b)(7)(A), (b)(7)(B), (b)(7)(C)”, which are related to improper disclosures of information, interference with enforcement proceedings, deprivation of the right to fair trial, and invasion of privacy respectively.

Leopold tweeted earlier in the day: “We intend to challenge all of the redactions.”

Mueller wrapped up the Russia investigation in March and the DOJ released a redacted version of his report in mid-April. The report showed Mueller's team did not find sufficient evidence showing criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin during the 2016 election. Mueller did not, however, clear Trump of obstruction of justice. Barr says he determined there is insufficient evidence to prove an obstruction crime, but Democrats argue Mueller's report, which outlines 10 instances of possible obstruction, leaves it up to Congress to investigate and decide.

Just days before Mueller's report was released the first time, the judge in the FOIA case appeared to be sympathetic to the arguments being made by BuzzFeed, leveling critiques at what he seemed to see as the secrecy being practiced by the Justice Department. ”Obviously there is a real concern about whether there will be transparency … I hope that the government will be as transparent as it can be,"" said Judge Reggie Walton of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.

Taking aim at Barr directly, Walton said, “The Attorney General has created an environment that has caused a significant part of the American public to be concerned about whether there will be full transparency.” The release of the redacted report is just the beginning of this litigation, and the case will likely continue moving forward in federal court shortly.

The same night the Justice Department released this second version of the Mueller report, the Justice Department was also engaged in a high-profile back-and-forth with the Democrat-run House Judiciary Committee over the department's refusal to turn over an unredacted version of the report.

Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., released a statement late Monday evening saying, “I am pleased that the Department of Justice has agreed to meet with my staff tomorrow — and not Wednesday afternoon, as originally proposed by DOJ.”

“It remains vital that the Committee obtain access to the full, unredacted report and the underlying materials,” Nadler said. “At the moment, our plans to consider holding Attorney General Barr accountable for his failure to comply with our subpoena still stand.”

Earlier in the day, Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said, “The Department remains willing to accommodate Congress’s legitimate needs, but must do so consistent with the law.”"
