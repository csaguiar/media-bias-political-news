"Trump tells Dems 'it's over,' says McGahn won't testify, hits Biden's 'very dumb statement' in Fox News interview",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Catherine Herridge', 'President Trump', 'Catherine Herridge Is An Award-Winning Chief Intelligence Correspondent For Fox News Channel', 'Fnc', 'Based In Washington', 'D.C. She Covers Intelligence', 'The Justice Department', 'The Department Of Homeland Security. Herridge Joined Fnc In As A London-Based Correspondent.']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-democrats-subpoena-biden-very-dumb-statement,"President Trump told Fox News in an exclusive wide-ranging interview Thursday evening that the White House has lost patience with congressional Democrats, and forcefully dismissed their efforts to subpoena former White House counsel Don McGahn and other administration officials to testify.

""They've testified for many hours, all of them. I would say, it's done,"" Trump told Fox News' Chief Intelligence Correspondent Catherine Herridge. ""Nobody has ever done what I've done. I've given total transparency. It's never happened before like this. They shouldn't be looking anymore. It's done.""

Attorney General Bill Barr made the right call in deciding not to appear before the House Judiciary Committee on Thursday, Trump said, following his testimony Wednesday in the Senate. House Democrats had insisted that committee counsel, rather than members of Congress, question Barr.

""It's not up to me, it’s up to him,"" Trump said, referring to Barr's decision not to show up. ""And they were going to treat him differently than they’ve treated other people. And of course we’ve been treated differently to start off with. We’ve gone through so many investigations, everybody. And it’s so ridiculous. No obstruction, no nothing -- there’s been no nothing. There’s been no collusion, there never was, they knew that from day one.""

Trump added, in a shot at the total cost of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe: ""Even my finances, it must have been looked at -- for $35 million, I assume they looked at my taxes, I assume Mueller looked at my financial statements. For $35 million, and having 20 people, 49 FBI agents, and all of the staff and all of the money they spent, I assume they looked at my taxes, which are fine -- except they are under audit, by the way.""

The New York Times reported earlier Thursday that the FBI secretly deployed an informant to London in 2016 to gather information from then-Trump foreign policy aide George Papadopoulos, who told Fox News later that the informant posed as a researcher and tried to ""seduce"" him.

Former FBI Director James Comey, Trump told Herridge, ""probably was one of the people leading the effort on spying"" on his campaign.

""Comey leaked and he lied,"" Trump said. ""He lied in front to Congress. He was sworn testimony, classified information. He did a terrible job. Everybody wanted him fired -- you now everybody; [Senate Minority Leader Chuck] Schumer, every Democrat almost, every Republican, almost -- probably 100 percent.""

Trump has called the subpoena issued to McGahn by House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., a ""ridiculous"" waste of time. The ex-White House lawyer sat for more than two dozen hours of interviews with Mueller and featured prominently in Mueller's report, and Trump has disputed the account in the report that he ordered McGahn to fire Mueller at one point.

""They shouldn't be looking anymore. It's done."" — President Trump

Trump additionally told Herridge he expected that key FBI documents that may shed light on the origins of the bureau's probe into his campaign could be declassified and released within a matter of weeks, or months at the latest.

REPORT: FBI SENT INFORMANT TO 'SEDUCE' TRUMP AIDE IN LONDON, ASK HIM ABOUT RUSSIA CONTACTS

""Yes, I’m going to be allowing declassification pretty soon,"" Trump said. ""I didn’t want to do it originally because I wanted to wait, because I know what they -- you know I’ve seen the way they play. They play very dirty. So I decided to do it, and I’m going to be doing if very soon, far more than you would have even thought.""

Trump previously told Fox News that his attorneys advised him not to declassify and release the full documents -- including surveillance warrant applications to monitor former Trump aide Carter Page and related materials -- while the Mueller probe was ongoing, for fear the administration would be accused of obstructing justice by doing so.

Asked about New York Attorney General Letitia James' ongoing efforts to investigate him on multiple fronts, Trump dismissed the probes as partisan stunts.

""Can you imagine someone campaigning -- she doesn't know anything about me, and she's campaigning on that fact,"" Trump said of the Democrat. ""They've gone through everything -- my taxes, my financial statements, which are phenomenal. And I'm so clean. Think of it -- after two and a half years, and all of that money spent, nothing. Very few people could have sustained that.""

White House contenders Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, Trump told Herridge, remain his most likely opponents in 2020.

""I'd be very happy if it were Biden, Sleepy Joe. I think he did a bad job. ... I just don't think he'd be a very good candidate. I mean, we'll see what happens. I wish him well, I'd like him to get it. I'd be happy with Bernie. I personally think it's between those two. I don't see anybody else, but could be. You never know.""

Biden expressed his lack of concern over China as a global competitor to the U.S. at a rally on Wednesday, prompting a grim response from Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah.

""China is going to eat our lunch? Come on, man!"" Biden exclaimed. ""The fact that they have this great division between the China Sea and the mountains in the East -- I mean in the West. They can't figure out how they're going to deal with the corruption that exists within the system. They're not bad folks, folks. But guess what, they're not competition for us.""

BIDEN DOWNPLAYS CHINA THREAT, AS ROMNEY ISSUES NEW WARNING

Reacting to those remarks, Trump said Biden was among many politicians ""naive"" over China. ""For somebody to be so naive, and say China's not a problem -- if Biden actually said that, that's a very dumb statement.""

And, as protesters and military forces clashed in Venezuela, Trump again indicated his strong support for opposition leader Juan Guaido.

""He's a brave guy, and what's happening in Venezuela is sad,"" Trump said, although he refused to draw a specific red line for military intervention.

""There's always a tipping point,"" Trump said, when pressed on what it would take for the U.S. military to become involved. ""Certainly, I'd rather not do that.""

Separately, Trump said China ""took advantage of us on trade like nobody in history has ever taken advantage of anyone,"" but revealed that an agreement amid the country's ongoing trade war with the U.S. could be imminent.

""Well, we are very close to a deal with China,"" Trump said. ""But it’s a question of whether or not I want to make it. I mean we’re going to make either a real deal, or we’re not going to make a deal at all. And if we don’t make a deal we’re going to tariff China, and that’ll be fine. We’ll -- frankly we’ll make a lot of money.""

Asked about the possibility of a June summit with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping, Trump was optimistic: ""I think we can probably do that. Yes, I do. I think we can do that. Yes."""
F.B.I. Sent Investigator Posing as Assistant to Meet With Trump Aide in 2016,https://www.nytimes.com,"['Adam Goldman', 'Michael S. Schmidt', 'Mark Mazzetti']",05-02-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/02/us/politics/fbi-government-investigator-trump.html,"Ms. Turk went to London to help oversee the politically sensitive operation, working alongside a longtime informant, the Cambridge professor Stefan A. Halper. The move was a sign that the bureau wanted in place a trained investigator for a layer of oversight, as well as someone who could gather information for or serve as a credible witness in any potential prosecution that emerged from the case.

A spokesman for the F.B.I. declined to comment, as did a lawyer for Mr. Halper, Robert D. Luskin. Last year, Bill Priestap, then the bureau’s top counterintelligence agent who was deeply involved in the Russia inquiry, told Congress during a closed-door hearing that there was no F.B.I. conspiracy against Mr. Trump or his campaign.

The London operation yielded no fruitful information, but F.B.I. officials have called the bureau’s activities in the months before the election both legal and carefully considered under extraordinary circumstances. They are now under scrutiny as part of an investigation by Michael E. Horowitz, the Justice Department inspector general. He could make the results public in May or June, Attorney General William P. Barr has said. Some of the findings are likely to be classified.

It is unclear whether Mr. Horowitz will find fault with the F.B.I.’s decision to have Ms. Turk, whose real name is not publicly known, meet with Mr. Papadopoulos. Mr. Horowitz has focused among other things on the activities of Mr. Halper, who accompanied Ms. Turk in one of her meetings with Mr. Papadopoulos and also met with him and other campaign aides separately. The bureau might also have seen Ms. Turk’s role as essential for protecting Mr. Halper’s identity as an informant if prosecutors ever needed court testimony about their activities.

Mr. Barr reignited the controversy last month when he told Congress, “I think spying on a political campaign is a big deal.” He backed off the charged declaration later in the same hearing, saying: “I think spying did occur. The question is whether it was adequately predicated. And I’m not suggesting that it wasn’t adequately predicated. But I need to explore that.”"
"Donald Trump Saves Aircraft Carrier, Ignoring Navy Advice",http://time.com,['John Walcott'],,,,http://time.com/5582063/trump-navy-truman-cybersecurity/,"In March, a report to the Secretary of the Navy warned that the service is preparing for the wrong war, one fought not with bombs and artillery but with terabytes and artificial intelligence.

“We find the Department of the Navy preparing to win some future kinetic battle, while it is losing the current global, counter-force, counter-value, cyber war,” the report says.

President Donald Trump, however, this week ordered the Navy to continue preparing for the last war, surprising Acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan, Navy Secretary Richard Spencer and Chief of Naval Operations, Adm. John Richardson, on Tuesday by reversing his February decision to retire the 21-year-old nuclear-powered aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman.

Trump’s decision will cost the Navy more than $20 billion over the next two decades, much of which the service had planned to spend on new unmanned vessels and other advanced technologies.

It also ignores the advice of the March report.

“In prior eras, for good or ill, navies shifted their definition from wood to steel to wing, or from sail to steam and beyond,” the report to Navy Secretary Spencer says.

“This time technology, not the naval service, or its opponents, have imposed a definition of what navies will be for the rest of the 21st Century,” it says. “Navies must become information enterprises who happen to operate on, over, under, and from the sea; a vast difference from a 355 ship mindset.”

Trump’s abrupt April 30 decision to change a section of the Navy budget he had approved earlier this year will please many bipartisan members of Congress, some of whom had vowed to keep the Truman — and a 355-vessel fleet with 12 aircraft carriers — afloat if Trump didn’t.

The decision also is consistent with the President’s aversion to discussing cybersecurity, such as protecting the 2020 elections from hackers. Physical structures have been the foundation of his business career, and building walls and ships employs more and different workers than writing algorithms does.

The President’s decision this week, however, was made without consulting Shanahan, Spencer or Richardson, according to two Administration officials who said they, too, were “ambushed,” as one put it.

“This is not the first time we’ve seen the President make a decision or countermand an order, and it won’t be the last,” said one of the officials, who helps oversee the Defense Department budget and spoke only on the condition of anonymity. “What’s really troubling though, is that decisions like this don’t go through any kind of policy process — there’s no deliberation, no meetings, no opportunity for input from anybody who knows what they’re talking about.”

According to a report in Breaking Defense, which TIME has confirmed, Shanahan was told of Trump’s decision only about two hours before Vice President Mike Pence announced it in remarks made aboard the Truman, and Richardson had prepared testimony defending the move to retire the carrier for a Senate Defense Appropriations subcommittee on Wednesday morning.

The Navy publicly supported the decision. “The Navy looks forward to working with the White House and Office of the Secretary of Defense in support of the President’s budget,” Capt. Greg Hicks, the Navy’s acting Chief of Information, said in a statement.

But the decision to remain on course may prove costly, as the 73-page readiness report warns.

“America once won wars with overwhelming manpower, then later won with superior industrial might, and with the Cold War, won with better technology,” it says. ” The cyber war has been ongoing for some time. The threat is long past the emergent or developing stage. While its ‘guns’ go unheard, it is real, and with as or more devastating consequences.”

While the U.S. remains “relatively flat-footed,” it continues, “both Russia and China are executing well developed cyber-enabled regional and global ‘grey zone’ unconventional strategies against the U.S. and its allies”.

Already, the report says, those strategies threaten to cripple the Navy’s ability to fight, no matter how many aircraft carriers it has.

“The systems the U.S. relies upon to mobilize, deploy, and sustain forces have been extensively targeted by potential adversaries, and compromised to such as extent that their reliability is questionable,” it says.

In layman’s terms, that means the U.S. Navy, as well as the Army, Air Force, and Marine Corps, may find they can’t count on all the satellites and other technology they use to navigate, communicate, locate targets and hit them.

Trump announces 'conscience objection' rule for medical care is finalized,https://www.cnn.com,"['Maegan Vazquez', 'Jessica Ravitz']",05-02-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/02/politics/trump-administration-final-rule-conscience-objections/index.html,"Washington (CNN) The Trump administration announced a new rule on religious conscience protections for the medical field on Thursday, aimed at protecting religious and moral objectors from participating in or paying for services such as abortion, sterilization and assisted suicide.

""Just today we finalized new protections of conscience rights for physicians, pharmacists, nurses, teachers, students and faith-based charities. They've been wanting to do that a long time,"" Trump said during a National Day of Prayer service at the White House Rose Garden on Thursday.

The final rule drew immediate condemnation from several civil and reproductive rights groups. They warned that those seeking reproductive care stand to lose, as do members of the LGBTQ community. They said the idea of religious liberty is being used to justify hurting communities and endangering lives and will negatively affect women's health and that of transgender patients.

The Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights said in a statement on Thursday that this final rule replaces one from 2011 that it deemed ""inadequate.""

According to the office, the rule will protect individuals and health care entities from unwanted involvement with services such as abortion, sterilization or assisted suicide. The rule, according to the office, reestablishes existing protections created by Congress.

The final rule also notes that complaints submitted to the office about gender dysphoria-related surgeries will be considered on a case-by-case basis.

The proposed conscience rule was submitted in January 2018 alongside the Department of Health and Human Services creation of the Conscience and Religious Freedom Division within its civil rights office, which provides resources and personnel to enforcing the new guidelines and ensuring compliance.

The Sunlight Foundation reported that last month the HHS Office of Civil Rights overhauled its mission statement, to heavily emphasize the office's role in protecting ""conscience and free exercise of religion.""

The office's director, Roger Severino, touted the final rule in a statement: ""Finally, laws prohibiting government funded discrimination against conscience and religious freedom will be enforced like every other civil rights law.""

Vanita Gupta, president and CEO of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, which aims to ""promote and protect the rights of all persons in the US,"" said in a statement that the rule should be ""scrapped.""

""HHS's final denial of care rule will substantially harm the health and well-being of many -- in particular women and transgender patients. The government should protect all patients from discrimination, not make it easier for those in the health care system to discriminate,"" Gupta, a former civil rights official at the Justice Department, said.

""Religious liberty is a fundamental right, but it doesn't include the right to discriminate or harm others,"" Louise Melling, deputy legal director at the American Civil Liberties Union, said in a statement. ""Denying patients health care is not religious liberty. Discriminating against patients based on their gender or gender expression is not religious liberty. Medical standards, not religious belief, should guide medical care.""

Letting personal religious beliefs get in the way of care is ""outrageous, immoral, and dangerous,"" said Kris Hayashi, executive director of the Transgender Law Center, in a statement.

The new rule also blocks access and chips away at the intent of important federal programs like the Title X family planning program, said Clare Coleman, president and CEO of the National Family Planning & Reproductive Health Association.

""This final rule ignores the needs of the patients and individuals served by HHS' programs and will create significant confusion about the rights and responsibilities of health care providers and entities,"" Coleman said in a statement."
Trump finds in Barr the attorney general — and shield — he long sought,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Matt Zapotosky', 'National Security Reporter Covering The Justice Department', 'Josh Dawsey', 'Reporter Covering The White House', 'Tom Hamburger', 'Investigative Reporter Focused On The Intersection Of Money', 'Politics In Washington', 'Ashley Parker', 'White House Reporter', 'May At Pm']",05-02-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/trump-finds-in-barr-the-attorney-general--and-shield--he-long-sought/2019/05/02/03b5faf0-6cea-11e9-be3a-33217240a539_story.html,"For a time, President Trump was reluctant to select William P. Barr as his attorney general. The veteran Justice Department official from the George H.W. Bush administration was not a longtime Trump loyalist, and the president wondered whether one of his own political allies might serve better as a shield, people familiar with the matter said.

But Trump was ultimately persuaded — in part because his lawyers and advisers told him Barr was a strong supporter of presidential power and unafraid of taking on critics. This week, the president has been thrilled with his choice, particularly after Barr sparred so vigorously with Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday that some were left wondering whether he viewed himself as the president’s defense attorney, according to people familiar with the matter, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.

[Barr spars with Democrats over ‘snitty’ Mueller letter]

In Barr’s first three months in the job, his actions have served to protect Trump, though his motive is up for debate. Barr’s defenders note that the attorney general has long advocated strengthening the power of the executive branch, and the attorney general has told other lawyers that he is more interested in protecting the presidency than the man in the job.

But critics say that Barr has emerged as the partisan champion Trump always wanted — one willing to defend the president’s most questionable conduct, put a Trumpian spin on the results of special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s investigation and mislead Congress along the way.

“He has failed the men and women of the Department of Justice by placing the needs of the president over the fair administration of justice,” Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) said at a congressional hearing Thursday that Barr skipped after a dispute over the terms of his appearance.

Barr’s defenders say he is unbothered by the criticism.

“He is not at all surprised at the partisan reception he received,” said Richard Cullen, an attorney and close friend of Barr’s who spoke with Barr after his Senate testimony. “He is going to follow what he believes is the law, politics be damned.” Cullen represents Vice President Pence.

Political fires have raged around Barr, who was also attorney general in the George H.W. Bush administration, from even before his confirmation along largely partisan lines. But he has come under sustained attack this week after The Washington Post reported that Mueller had sent a memo to Barr complaining about how the attorney general had described the results of the special counsel investigation in a letter to Congress.

[Mueller complained that Barr’s letter did not capture ‘context’ of Trump probe]

In his letter to Congress after Mueller ended his inquiry, Barr wrote that Mueller had not found that Trump or his associates coordinated with Russia to influence the election, and that the special counsel would not reach a decision on whether the president obstructed justice. Mueller countered in his own letter that the attorney general “did not fully capture the context, nature, and substance” of the special counsel’s work.

The revelation of Mueller’s March letter — which Barr derided as “a bit snitty” — sparked calls from some Democrats for Barr to resign. They also accused the attorney general of lying to Congress for not revealing Mueller’s concerns during a congressional hearing in April. Barr was asked during that hearing whether he knew to what media reports were referring when they revealed frustration among some on Mueller’s team about the limited information Barr had revealed to Congress about their work.

“He lied to Congress,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said during a news conference Thursday. “The attorney general of the United States of America was not telling the truth to the Congress of the United States. That’s a crime.”

Kerri Kupec, a Justice Department spokeswoman, said Pelosi’s comment was “reckless, irresponsible, and false.”

Trump, who spent a few hours at most with Barr before picking him as attorney general, told people that he was pleased with Barr’s pugnacious performance before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday, though one Trump ally who regularly speaks with the president said his joy was “shortsighted” because Barr lost credibility with some lawmakers who could be useful later.

On Wednesday night, Trump tweeted a link to a Wall Street Journal editorial lauding Barr’s testimony and bearing the headline, “A Real Attorney General” — a phrase which, to Trump, means “someone who is defending him at all costs,” one former White House official said. Trump and senior White House officials have urged surrogates to go on TV and praise Barr — and even arranged a call Wednesday afternoon to disseminate supportive talking points.

People familiar with the matter said that in the call, deputy White House press secretary Steven Groves told them to say of Barr that “nobody really laid a glove on him” and that Barr had “dismembered arguments about obstruction of justice.”

[How a legal dispute between Mueller and Barr drove the end of the special counsel’s probe]

Before he was nominated, Barr wrote a detailed memo — which he sent to the Justice Department, as well as to lawyers working for the White House and Trump — blasting Mueller’s apparent theory of how Trump could have interfered with justice as “fatally misconceived.” In Barr’s view, the president should not be investigated for using his powers to affect an investigation — meaning that the firing of James B. Comey as FBI director would be out of reach for federal prosecutors.

Democrats alleged that the memo was essentially a tip at the time about how he might curtail Mueller’s not-yet-completed probe. On Wednesday, Barr held to his view, repeatedly insisting that Trump’s asking his White House counsel to have Mueller removed was not a prosecutable obstruction case because Trump had a legal right to end Mueller’s investigation.

Mueller declined to conclude whether his team believed there was a prosecutable case against Trump for obstructing justice. His report, which laid out detailed accounts of possible obstructive conduct he investigated, asserted that he could not say even privately whether the president committed a crime because of Justice Department guidance that says a sitting president cannot be indicted. Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein reviewed the case themselves and determined that a charge could not be brought.

A White House official said that Barr had “set the narrative” in a way that was positive for the White House and that the swirling debate about the special counsel has just been “noise.”

David Rivkin, a conservative lawyer who has worked with Barr, said he believed Barr was more interested in defending the executive branch of government than the president himself. Barr was no early Trump supporter; he was a major political contributor to Jeb Bush, one of the president’s primary opponents.

“His behavior is sufficiently explained by his well-known and publicly articulated views to constitutional principles,” Rivkin said.

Barr also turned the tables on Mueller — expressing confusion about how the special counsel came to some decisions and confirming that he would examine, as many Republicans want, the origins of the FBI probe that the special counsel eventually took over.

Trump campaign advisers, who said they had raised more than $1 million after the Mueller report was released, said the attorney general’s comments have generally been helpful — especially his earlier assertion that there was “spying” during the 2016 presidential race.

At the same time, Barr sought to extricate the Justice Department from the political battles of Mueller’s investigation, declaring at one point, “We are out of it.” The comment resonated with some Barr supporters who are eager to see more stability in the Justice Department.

“It seems to me that the attorney general’s handling of the report and the issues it raised now has a punctuation point, and there are many other important matters to the American people on his plate that merit attention,” said George Terwilliger, a former deputy attorney general and a friend of Barr’s.

But more battles lie ahead. Last month, White House lawyer Emmet Flood sent Barr a letter declaring that Trump’s decision not to invoke executive privilege to block any portions of the Mueller report should not be over-interpreted. The president, Flood wrote, might still seek to curtail his advisers’ cooperation with Congress over the report or prevent the release of underlying investigative materials.

That posture will almost certainly spark a battle between Congress and the White House — with Barr at the center of the fight.

The Catastrophic Performance of Bill Barr,https://www.theatlantic.com,"['Benjamin Wittes', 'Editor In Chief Of']",05-02-2019,2019,5,https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/05/bill-barrs-performance-was-catastrophic/588574/,"Quinta Jurecic: All of the impeachable offenses

Barr has consistently sought to spin his department’s work in a highly political fashion, and he has done so to cast the president’s conduct in the most favorable possible light. Trump serially complained that Jeff Sessions didn’t act to “protect” him. Matthew Whitaker never had the stature or internal clout to do so effectively. In Barr, Trump has found his man.

Ironically, the redactions on the report—the matter on which I urged giving Barr the benefit of the doubt—are the one major area where his performance has been respectable. On this matter, he laid out a time frame for the release of the report. He met it. His redactions, as best as I can tell, were not unreasonable, though they were aggressive in some specific areas. To whatever extent he went overboard, Congress has a far-less-redacted version. The public, in any event, has access to a detailed account of Mueller’s conclusions. On this point, Barr did as he said he would.

Where Barr has utterly failed, by contrast, is in providing “honest leadership that insulates [the department] from the predations of the president.” I confess I am surprised by this. I have never known Barr well, but I thought better of him than that.

The core of the problem is not that Barr moved, as many people worried he would, to suppress the report; it is what he has said about it. I have spent a great deal of time with the Mueller report, about which Barr’s public statements are simply indefensible. The mischaracterizations began in his first letter. They got worse during his press conference the morning he released the document. And they grew worse still yesterday in his testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee.

Barr did not lie in any of these statements. He did not, as some people insist, commit perjury. I haven’t found a sentence he has written or said that cannot be defended as truthful on its own terms, if only in some literal sense. But it is possible to mislead without lying. One can be dishonest before Congress without perjury. And one can convey sweeping untruths without substantial factual misstatement. This is what Barr has been doing since that first letter. And it is utterly beneath the United States Department of Justice.

John Yoo: Mueller left a gap. Barr just filled it.

The dishonesty only begins with the laughably selective quotation of Mueller’s report in Barr’s original letter, the scope of which Charlie Savage laid out in a remarkable New York Times article shortly after the full report was released. I urge people to look at Savage’s side-by-side quotations. The distortion of Mueller’s meaning across a range of areas is not subtle, and it’s not hard to understand why Mueller himself wrote to Barr saying that the attorney general’s letter “did not fully capture the context, nature, and substance of this Office’s work and conclusions.”"
Interior Dept. Loosens Offshore-Drilling Safety Rules Dating From Deepwater Horizon,https://www.nytimes.com,['Coral Davenport'],05-02-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/02/climate/offshore-drilling-safety-rollback-deepwater-horizon.html,"Want climate news in your inbox? Sign up here for Climate Fwd:, our email newsletter.

WASHINGTON — The Trump administration on Thursday made public its rollback of a major offshore-drilling safety regulation, significantly weakening an Obama-era rule that was put in place after the 2010 Deepwater Horizon explosion in the Gulf of Mexico, which killed 11 people and sent 4.9 million barrels of oil gushing into the sea, causing the worst oil spill in American history.

Interior Secretary David Bernhardt, a former oil lobbyist who was confirmed by the Senate last month to head the agency that oversees the nation’s public lands and waters, announced the plan Thursday afternoon in Port Fourchon, La., the vast industrial hub that serves as the onshore base for most companies that drill in the Gulf of Mexico.

The oil industry praised the move. Environmental groups warned that the rollbacks could pave the way for similar crises to happen again.

The weakened safety rules come as the Trump administration has also sought to vastly expand offshore drilling in the nation’s waters. Last year the Interior Department proposed opening almost the entire United States coastline to drilling, although Mr. Bernhardt recently said the administration may delay those plans while court challenges are addressed."
VA Comes Out Against Bills on Medical Marijuana for Veterans,https://www.military.com,['Patricia Kime'],05-02-2019,2019,5,https://www.military.com/daily-news/2019/05/02/va-comes-out-against-bills-medical-marijuana-veterans.html,"The Department of Veterans Affairs opposes three legislative proposals that would expand research on medical marijuana at the VA and give veterans access to the drug in states where it is legal.

During a hearing Tuesday on eight VA health-related bills under consideration by Congress, VA officials told House lawmakers that as long as marijuana is illegal under federal law, the department cannot support legislation that promotes its role at the VA.

""[The House Veterans Affairs Committee] can make strong proposals for us to move forward with recommendations of filling out forms and such but, in the end, we need to go back to the [Drug Enforcement Agency] and [Justice Department] for their opinion,"" said Larry Mole, chief consultant for population health at the VA.

Three of the bills before the House Veterans Affairs health subcommittee relate to medical marijuana. One, the Veterans Equal Access Act, H.R. 1647, sponsored by Rep. Earl Blumenauer, D-Oregon, would allow VA health providers to recommend medical marijuana to their veteran patients and fill out the necessary paperwork for them to enroll in state marijuana programs.

Related content:

Blumenauer, who has introduced the bill in every Congress since 2014, said that, for some veterans, marijuana and cannabis derivatives are lifesavers that keep them from using addictive medications such as opioids to treat post-traumatic stress disorder, chronic pain, seizures and glaucoma. Yet VA health care providers are not allowed to recommend it.

""Opioids steal the lives of 115 Americans every day ... as veterans with PTSD, chronic pain and any number of ailments are looking for relief, lethal opioid overdoses among VA patients are almost twice the national average. We are doing something wrong,"" he said.

Another bill, the VA Medicinal Cannabis Research Act, H.R. 712, would direct the VA to conduct a large-scale clinical trial on the effects of cannabis on conditions such as PTSD and chronic pain.

Bill sponsor Rep. Lou Correa, D-California, said the research would examine the effectiveness of cannabis on various health conditions, as well as delivery methods.

""It's time to do research. It's time for veterans to know what cannabis is good for and what cannabis is not good for,"" Correa said.

A third, the Veterans Cannabis Use for Safe Healing Act, H.R. 2192, would protect veterans' benefits by prohibiting the VA from denying health care and compensation for veterans participating in a state medical marijuana program.

Keita Franklin, the VA's national director of suicide prevention, said that while the department supports medical marijuana research and is currently involved in a trial for treating PTSD, it opposes the bills.

According to Franklin, VA doctors would be subject to criminal prosecution if they recommended medical marijuana or made referrals to state agencies, as specified by DEA guidance.

And Correa's bill, she said, would not follow standard practice in medical research.

""Typically, a smaller early-phase trial would advance our knowledge and the benefits and risks regarding cannabis before moving to the expansive approach described in this legislation,"" she said. ""Any trial involving human subjects must include an evaluation on the risks and the safety, and include the smallest number of participants to avoid putting the subjects at increased risk unnecessarily. For these reasons, we don't support this legislation.""

She added that the third piece of legislation is unnecessary because VA policy states that the department cannot deny benefits based on marijuana use, although VA physicians are allowed to tailor a patient's prescription medications based on whether they are using cannabis.

Veterans advocates who testified expressed varying levels of support for the bills.

Carlos Fuentes, director of national legislative service for the Veterans of Foreign Wars, said the VFW does not support the Veterans Equal Access bill because it doesn't think the VA should recommend unproven medical treatments, nor should it authorize a treatment for a veteran that would require the former service member to get it outside the VA, where they would be responsible for finding a quality product and paying for it.

The VFW does, however, support VA research on cannabis.

""VA's overreliance on opioids to treat chronic pain and other conditions has led to addiction and even deaths. To its credit ... VA has reduced the number of patients to whom it has prescribed opioids by 22 percent. Now, VA must expand research on the efficacy of nontraditional alternatives to opioids,"" Fuentes said.

Joy Ilam, national legislative director for Disabled American Veterans, agreed.

""We want to make sure there is no harm done. Research is the first step in doing that,"" Ilam said.

Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America research director Stephanie Mullen said the IAVA supports cannabis research and access to it.

""It's past time for VA to catch up,"" Mullen said. ""Veterans are suffering from their injuries today.""

Among the other bills and draft bills discussed at the hearing was one that seeks to expand complementary and alternative therapies and treatments at VA medical facilities, and another that would require the VA to report suicides and attempts that occur on VA campuses within a week of them happening.

Franklin said the VA supports both proposals.

Trump’s Justice Department doesn’t understand that four is less than five,https://thinkprogress.org,[],,,,https://thinkprogress.org/trump-obamacare-case-texas-fifth-circuit-871aecda0599/,"There is literally no rule more basic to U.S. litigation than the rule of five. The Supreme Court has nine seats. It takes a majority to decide a case. A decision joined by five or more justices is a binding interpretation of the law that controls all other court decisions. An opinion dissenting from such a decision is just someone’s views.

And yet, a pair of briefs filed Wednesday evening by a team of anti-Obamacare lawyers — including one filed by the Trump Justice Department and another filed by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton on behalf of several red states — fails to grasp this rudimentary rule. Both briefs, in a case asking a federal court to repeal the entirety of Obamacare, rely heavily on a dissenting opinion by four of the Supreme Court’s most conservative members. And a dissenting opinion, by definition, is not the law.

The case is Texas v. United States.

Making something of nothing

As originally enacted, the Affordable Care Act’s “individual mandate” required most Americans to either obtain health insurance or pay higher income taxes. The Supreme Court famously upheld this provision of the original, 2010 law as a valid exercise of Congress’ power to tax.

Seven years later, after Congress spent the better part of the year debating plans to repeal the Affordable Care Act in its entirety and failed to enact any one of these plans, Congress passed a tax law which contained a single provision changing the tax penalty for failing to buy insurance to zero dollars. Thus, Congress chose to leave the entire law intact, with the exception that it effectively repealed the individual mandate.

Although the 2017 version of the mandate does nothing — it requires individuals to either carry insurance or pay zero dollars — the Texas plaintiffs claim that it is now unconstitutional on the theory that the Supreme Court upheld it as a tax, but it no longer functions as a tax because it doesn’t collect any tax revenue. That’s a plausible argument, but it should be a purely academic one. Who cares if a provision of the law that literally does nothing is unconstitutional?

Indeed, the fact that the challenged provision does absolutely nothing should be the end of this case. In order to file a federal lawsuit, a plaintiff must have “standing,” meaning that they must be able to show that the law they are challenging injures them in some way. But a zero dollar tax injures no one, so no one has standing to challenge it.

Nevertheless, the Texas plaintiffs ask the courts to ignore this standing requirement and strike down the neutered mandate. Then they seek much, much more.

4 > 5

When a court declares one provision of a larger federal statute unconstitutional, it often must ask whether other, constitutional provisions of the law must fall with it — an inquiry known as “severability.” Severability, by its very nature, is a speculative inquiry. It asks whether Congress would have enacted the constitutional provisions of a law if it had known that the unconstitutional provisions could not take effect.

When engaging in this speculation, moreover, courts must apply a very strong presumption that Congress did not intend for additional provisions to fall. As the Supreme Court explained most recently in Murphy v. National Collegiate Athletic Association, “in order for other . . . provisions to fall it must be ‘evident that [Congress] would not have enacted those provisions which are within its power, independently of [those] which [are] not’”

So Texas is a very easy case, even if you ignore the fact that these plaintiffs lack standing. And even if you concede that the zeroed-out mandate is unconstitutional, we already know what Congress would have done if it had known that the powerless mandate would be struck down. Again, Congress spent the better part of a year debating whether to repeal the Affordable Care Act, ultimately decided not to repeal the law, and then passed a law that canceled just one provision of Obamacare — the individual mandate. That’s conclusive proof that Congress intended to eliminate the mandate while leaving the rest of law intact.

To get around this proof, the Texas plaintiffs and the Trump administration rely heavily on a dissenting opinion penned by four conservative justices in NFIB v. Sebelius, the 2012 decision upholding most of the Affordable Care Act.

In that opinion, the dissenting justices claimed that the original version of the individual mandate — the version that actually did something — is unconstitutional. They then argued that the Affordable Care Act is a carefully balanced machine made up of interlocking regulations, subsidies, and taxes. Remove a major cog in this machine, they argued, and the entire apparatus must fall because each moving part depends on the others.

Texas and the Trump administration argue that this logic should also apply to a decision striking down the zeroed-out, 2017 version of the mandate.

There are more problems with this argument than one can count. The most obvious one is, again, that a dissenting opinion is not the law. Texas’ and the Trump administration’s argument rests on the assumption that four justices are more than five.

Moreover, not only is a dissenting opinion not the law, but a majority of the Supreme Court explicitly rejected the dissent’s argument that the Affordable Care Act is collection of interlocking parts that must stand or fall together. While NFIB left most of the law intact, it did strike down a provision that imposed strict financial consequences on states that rejected Obamacare’s Medicaid expansion.

But NFIB did not hold that, because this one important cog was removed from Obamacare’s machine, the entire law must fall. “We have no way of knowing how many States will accept the terms of the expansion,” Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the controlling opinion, “but we do not believe Congress would have wanted the whole Act to fall, simply because some may choose not to participate.” The bulk of the law, he noted, “will remain ‘fully operative as a law,’ and will still function in a way ‘consistent with Congress’ basic objectives in enacting the statute.’”

The same logic should apply to Texas. After all, the practical difference between the post-2017 version of the law, which contains a powerless “mandate” that does absolutely nothing, and a different version of the law with the zeroed-out mandate excised, is absolutely nothing. With or without the gelded mandate, the law functions exactly the same. And thus it remains “fully operative as a law” and will “still function in a way ‘consistent with Congress basic objectives'” in enacting the 2017 version of the statute.

And there’s another major problem with Texas and the Trump administration’s reliance on the NFIB dissent. Even if that dissent were the law, it was written in 2012. Murphy was handed down in 2018. Thus, to the extent that the NFIB dissent conflicts with Murphy, it is superseded by Murphy. Courts must uphold the bulk of the Affordable Care Act unless it is “evident” that Congress would not have enacted the bulk of the law without the do-nothing mandate.

The theory behind Texas, in other words, does not have any basis in American law. But the two briefs’ reliance on the NFIB dissent is still revealing. The real premise underlying Texas is that, now that the courts have taken a sharp right turn, dissenting opinions penned by the Supreme Court’s most conservative members should be treated as if they were the law, and the law itself should be ignored.

A least some members of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which will hear Texas in July, appear to agree with this premise — as evidenced by a recent abortion case where the Fifth Circuit defied a recent Supreme Court decision handed down before Justice Anthony Kennedy left the bench. Significantly, Chief Justice Roberts voted to stay the Fifth Circuit’s defiance, signaling to lower courts that they cannot simply ignore the Supreme Court’s decisions.

Texas will be a good test of whether the Fifth Circuit got the message."
"Ned Ryun: FBI, DOJ abuses in Russia collusion probe must be exposed – Lawbreakers should go to prison",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Ned Ryun', 'Ned Ryun Is The Founder', 'Ceo Of American Majority', 'A National Grassroots Organization. Learn More At']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/ned-ryun-fbi-and-doj-abuses-in-russia-collusion-probe-must-be-exposed-lawbreakers-should-go-to-prison,"As the media and Democrats lose control of their fairy tale claim that there was collusion between Russia and the Trump presidential campaign to elect Donald Trump president, it is fascinating to watch them flailing about, doubling and even tripling down on a hoax and conspiracy theory.

Now Trump opponents have a growing sense of impending dread that the truth of what took place over the last several years might actually come to light.

We now have a real attorney general in William Barr. He refuses to cower in the face of careerists at the Justice Department and FBI, and he faces down congressional Democrats for the political hacks they are.

SARAH SANDERS: RUSSIA INVESTIGATION IS OVER, 'TIME FOR DEMOCRATS TO MOVE ON'

Barr has stated clearly that he believes there was spying on the 2016 Trump campaign. He has said there are multiple investigations currently taking place regarding illegal leaks from the Justice Department and FBI. And he has pledged to get to the bottom of apparent abuses of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA).

Is it any wonder that there have been concerted attacks on Barr in recent weeks by Trump opponents to delegitimize the attorney general?

Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz’s report on FISA abuses will be coming out later this month or in June. We will then get some clarity and a detailed explanation of what took place regarding the FBI’s FISA applications to conduct surveillance of communications involving Carter Page, a foreign policy adviser on the Trump presidential campaign.

The only way we can deal with this abuse is to have serious consequences for these actions. People must go to prison for breaking the law.

As all of this is taking place, President Trump has said he will release the unredacted applications to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to authorize surveillance under FISA.

What we know right now is that former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe testified under oath to the House Intelligence Committee in December 2017 that the surveillance applications would not have been possible without the Steele dossier, a collection of memos assembled by former British spy Christopher Steele.

The dossier was described by former FBI Director James Comey as “salacious and unverified.”

We also know that this was substantiated by a memo from Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., and a memo for Republican Sens. Chuck Grassley of Iowa and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina.

The senators wrote in their memo that several of FISA applications were almost wholly based on the unsubstantiated Steele dossier.

There are rumors that the Horowitz report will be devastating to some individuals who were involved in the FISA process. What will likely happen after the release of the report is that Barr will use it as the basis to appoint and empower someone within the Justice Department to investigate the matter further. That person will be given the power to impanel grand juries, use subpoenas and seek indictments for prosecution.

Many of us have believed for the last several years that a small, but extremely powerful cabal within the intelligence community and law enforcement felt – because of their self-righteous arrogance and partisan leanings – that they could use the immense power of the surveillance state to conduct a partisan attack on a political opponent.

These officials felt justified in their actions because they believed Donald Trump was not a suitable person to be president of the United States and because they had policy differences with Trump.

All of what we have seen over the last several years has revealed the FISA safeguards are an utter sham. If FBI agents and Justice Department lawyers are willing to lie and falsify information to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court – and more importantly, if there are no consequences for those actions – then FISA is a joke. This also means that our civil liberties are a joke and we will have accepted a police state that can use a piece of partisan propaganda or anything else as a justification to spy on private citizens.

In addition, it appears that some in that cabal feared Trump becoming president because they believed he would demand great accountability and transparency inside of the intelligence and law enforcement community.

I hope that investigations likely coming out of the inspector general’s report will lead to answers regarding former CIA Director John Brennan’s role in giving credence to the Steele dossier.

And I hope the inspector general’s report will provide answers to why the initial FISA application authorizing surveillance of Page was approved and then renewed three more times.

I suspect that the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court judges took the FBI at its word and that someone who is guilty at a minimum of the crime of falsifying by omission did not admit to the court that the applications were based on a piece of partisan propaganda.

All of these things are deeply troubling because our surveillance and law enforcement regimes are based primarily on trust. Trust that those seeking FISA applications to surveil American citizens are being honest, and trust that they are above reproach.

The problem that we now confront is that the trust placed in these people and in the process has been shattered. We must remember that the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act was enacted in response to abuses at the FBI under Director J. Edgar Hoover, who headed the bureau from 1924 until his death in 1972.

During the Hoover years, the FBI spied on Americans based on suspicions without verified evidence. Targets of the spying included civil rights leader Martin Luther King, members of Congress and Vietnam War protesters.

As a response to these abuses, the FISA regime was created. FISA requires the FBI to have verified evidence that it must submit to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to gain approval to spy.

All of what we have seen over the last several years has revealed the FISA safeguards are an utter sham. If FBI agents and Justice Department lawyers are willing to lie and falsify information to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court – and more importantly, if there are no consequences for those actions – then FISA is a joke.

This also means that our civil liberties are a joke and we will have accepted a police state that can use a piece of partisan propaganda or anything else as a justification to spy on private citizens.

The only way we can deal with this abuse is to have serious consequences for these actions. People must go to prison for breaking the law.

I hope that in the midst of all of this, Attorney General Barr and FBI Director Christopher Wray will realize that beyond serious consequences, there must be radical transparency to return trust in the Justice Department and FBI.

Barr and Wray need to understand that their greatest loyalty is to the Constitution, not to institutions, because it is upon that great document that those institutions rest. The Justice Department and FBI do not exist for the sake of the institutions, but to protect and guard our civil liberties and the rule of law. We would all do well to remember that.

Robert Charles: Attorney General Barr is right not to testify before House Dems,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Robert Charles', 'Robert Charles Is A Former Assistant Secretary Of State For President George W. Bush', 'Former Naval Intelligence Officer', 'Litigator. He Served In The Reagan', 'Bush White Houses.']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/robert-charles-attorney-general-barr-is-right-not-to-testify-before-house-dems,"House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y, did something Wednesday that Americans have not seen since Sen. Joseph McCarthy, R-Wis., threw democracy aside, running roughshod over rules, fellow members of Congress and due process in the 1950s.

Nadler ignored House rules, dismissed Republican motions and refused 40 attempts to permit committee debate, regular order and amendments so he could get the Democratic majority on the committee to impose the unreasonable requirement that Attorney General Barr be questioned by a Democratic and a Republican attorney when he was scheduled to testify Thursday morning.

Faced with this demand, Barr quite properly canceled plans to testify before the House Judiciary Committee about his handling of the report by Special Counsel Robert Mueller dealing with Russian interference in our 2016 presidential election.

NADLER SLAMS BARR'S DECISION TO SKIP HOUSE HEARING, THREATENS CONTEMPT CITATION: 'HE IS TERRIFIED'

Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec called Nadler's demands ""inappropriate"" and said Barr would answer questions from elected House members on the panel. “Chairman Nadler placed conditions on the House Judiciary Committee hearing that are unprecedented and unnecessary,"" Kupec said.

Nadler staged a lawless, disgraceful committee session Wednesday intended to ramrod his personal views and political agenda down the committee’s throat, embarrass and demean Barr and humiliate President Trump.

As Americans watched on TV or the Internet, Nadler summarily ignored House rules, written procedures, legal traditions and due process.

In his attempt to force Barr to undergo formal cross-examination by outside counsel – a practice reserved for witnesses of questionable truthfulness or inscrutability – Nadler stiff-armed dozens of Republican attempts to simply offer motions, debate, clarify, amend or adjourn the hearing.

What is the endgame? Destroy this president – even if Congress’s institutional integrity, the integrity of an honorable attorney general, and the integrity of countless others are destroyed in the process.

At one point, instead of recognizing any of 40 or more Republican motions seeking to be heard, Nadler shut Republicans down with a forced vote, then recorded it, pretending Republicans did not exist. Joe McCarthy would feel outdone, but average Americans just felt sick.

Listeners and those watching on television were left agog. Nadler’s performance was a partisan tour de force, which likely earned him Democrat backslaps off-stage, but to average Americans it was simply a disgrace.

In an age of ante-upping and outrage, the chairman’s arrogant, unadulterated embrace of lawlessness takes Congress to a new and darker place.

Nadler abandoned not only established practice, but honest dialogue, civil discourse, and fairness in the committee commissioned to oversee fair administration of our laws.

Judicious, the chairman was not. If Nadler’s spectacle had played out in any town or town hall, school board meeting, parent-teacher assembly, community council, executive or working session anywhere in America, it could have led to fisticuffs and ouster.

But this is the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives. Republican members were left trying to be heard – in vain. Nadler’s McCarthy-style tactics are becoming common across the Democratic-controlled committees.

In addition to shamelessly shutting off Republicans in hearings, Democrats are blasting out subpoenas and threats of contempt in unprecedented numbers, including a threat of a subpoena and a contempt charge against Barr.

Why? Because Barr stepped up to serve, thoughtfully summarized, redacted and released a report he was not legally required to release, volunteered to testify before members of Congress about it, and then faced a bait-and-switch. Suddenly he was being treated like a criminal or witness of questionable character, subject to interrogation by outside counsel.

When the attorney general of the United States, in his second tour of duty, resisted this House Democratic trick, Nadler pulled the subpoena and contempt threat. Barr then decided not to come to the Thursday hearing.

This is what the U.S. House of Representatives has come to –McCarthy-era tactics, regular abuse of committee process and powers, shutting down fellow representatives, bait-and-switch ploys, subpoenas and contempt threatened daily, issued after witnesses volunteer to testify.

What is the endgame? Destroy this president -- even if Congress’s institutional integrity, the integrity of an honorable attorney general, and the integrity of countless others are destroyed in the process.

Take out anything and everything tied to this president, from high school kids protesting abortion in their MAGA hats to committee Republicans seeking only to be heard on rules of the House. The Democratic message: We control the House. Sit down and shut up.

And that – in a nutshell – is why average Americans are distressed, disgusted, discouraged and disheartened by this House leadership. Chairmen like Nadler are unstoppable, unwilling to be fair, unrepentant and unable to govern.

For five years, as House staff director and counsel to the Oversight Committee’s National Security Subcommittee, I never saw a committee or subcommittee chairman refuse colleagues the chance to be heard – never imagined a chairman shutting down 40 attempts by the minority to speak.

We are now in a different place. Not only did Nadler upend House rules, fairness and history by shutting down his colleagues. He fundamentally embarrassed the chamber.

For those who saw his actions, it was a stark lesson in the corrupting influence of power. It reminded Americans everywhere that arrogance can gut a mandate.

Attorney General Barr composed himself professionally, honorably and collegially before the Senate Wednesday under harsh questioning.

Insulted and accused by Senator Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, of having “lied” to Congress, despite his explanation of the facts, he kept his cool. Subject to character attacks and equally baseless accusations by Senator Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., Barr again stayed calm.

Let’s cut to the chase: The attorney general is no shrinking violet. He testified boldly, thoughtfully and thoroughly before the Senate.

Barr is right not to appear before outside counsel at a House Judiciary Committee that played fast and loose with the facts, then bait-and-switch with committee promises, and now threatens him with a subpoena and contempt.

Too bad an attorney general cannot hold a House Judiciary Committee chairman in contempt when the chairman throws fairness to the wind, turns a committee dark with partisanship, ignores due process, and shuts down the committee’s own members.

Those intent on bringing down President Trump should remember: Ends do not justify means in a democracy. Joe McCarthy learned – the hard way. Here we go again. When will the Democratic abuse of power stop?

Mark Meadows sends criminal referral targeting Nellie Ohr to DOJ,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-02-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/mark-meadows-sends-criminal-referral-targeting-nellie-ohr-to-doj,"Nellie Ohr, the wife of Justice Department official Bruce Ohr, is the subject of a criminal referral sent to the Justice Department on Wednesday.

Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., wrote up the referral addressed to Attorney General William Barr, citing concerns that Ohr ""knowingly provided false testimony"" last year to a joint task force of the House Oversight and Judiciary committees that were investigating decisions made by the Justice Department and FBI surrounding the 2016 election.

The Hill reported Meadows, a member of House Oversight, has filed a referral with the Justice Department in the evening Wednesday. The Washington Examiner has not independently confirmed it has been sent and has reached out to Meadows' office.

""During her transcribed interview, Ms. Ohr testified she 'would not have any knowledge of what [was] going on in an ongoing investigation' at DOJ and would not 'have any knowledge of the Department of Justice’s investigations on Russia.' Ms. Ohr also denied she shared her research on Russian organized crime and Donald Trump with individuals outside of Fusion GPS (her employer); her husband, DOJ attorney Bruce Ohr, and Christopher Steele,"" Meadows wrote in the referral.

""However, documents reviewed by our committees raise concerns Ms. Ohr not only had knowledge of an ongoing DOJ investigation, but that she shared information and research on Russian organized crime to assist DOJ, in direct contradiction with her testimony,"" he added.

Ohr conducted research on connections between Russia and President Trump, having been contracted by Fusion GPS, the same opposition research firm behind the infamous Trump dossier. Meadows pointed to emails made public though a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit by conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch that show Ohr was in contact with Justice Department officials in 2016.

""For example, in March 2016, DOJ official Lisa Holtyn sent Bruce Ohr an email asking if Nellie would be able to speak with Ivana Nizich and Joe Wheatley to discuss her research as part of an ongoing investigation as she was told 'Nellie might be a great resource.' When Mr. Ohr checked if Nellie would feel comfortable speaking with DOJ, Nellie emailed 'Sure!'"" Meadows said.

""A separate email chain indicates Ms. Ohr shared her research on Russian organized crime in contradiction to her testimony. Specifically, on a separate email chain between Nellie Ohr, Mr. Ohr, Ms. Holtyn, and DOJ officials Joe Wheatley and Ivana Nizich, Ms. Ohr provides the Department of Justice with analysis of Shakro, a Russian mafia boss, and the separatists in the Donbass war,"" he added.

""Taking these communications into account, in addition to other information we have reviewed, Meadows said, ""Ms. Ohr misled the committees when she testified she would not have any knowledge of what was going on in an ongoing DOJ investigation, and that she had not shared her research outside of Fusion GPS, her husband, and Christopher Steele. Truthful witness testimony is crucial to the integrity of investigations conducted by the House of Representatives. Ms. Ohr violated her oath to tell the truth by making demonstrably false statements during her testimony before the Committee. Accordingly, I am referring Nellie Ohr to the Department of Justice for investigation of potential violation(s) of 18 U.S.C.§1001 et seq.""

Ohr testified to the Oversight and Judiciary committees in October. The transcript was made public by Judiciary ranking member Doug Collins in March.

The testimony focused heavily on her time with Fusion GPS and its relationship with the DOJ. Nellie Ohr said she met three times with Christopher Steele, the author of the dossier that contained unverified claims about Russia having compromising information about Trump. The last of those meetings took place on July 30, 2016, a day before the FBI initiated a counterintelligence investigation into links between the Russian government and the Trump campaign. It is believed that FBI agent Peter Strzok, now-infamous for exchanging anti-Trump text messages with a colleague, signed the order that launched the inquiry.

Ohr's husband, Bruce Ohr, acted as an unofficial back channel between the FBI and Steele. He was demoted when it was revealed he met with Steele and Glenn Simpson, the co-founder of the opposition research firm Fusion GPS, which commissioned Steele's work. Ohr also told lawmakers his wife shared a thumb drive with him to hand over to the FBI.

The dossier, which contained unverified claims about Trump's ties to Russia, has been a subject of concern for GOP lawmakers, particularly for how it was used by the FBI in Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant applications to gain the authority to spy on onetime Trump campaign adviser Carter Page.

The FBI suspended its relationship with Steele in October 2016 for unauthorized contact with the media. Despite this, the FBI maintained an unofficial back channel with Steele up to at least November 2017 via Ohr

More criminal referrals from Meadows could be in the works. At an event Tuesday, the congressman said he knows of ""two or three individuals"" tied to Fusion GPS who could be the subject of criminal referrals for lying to Congress."
"EPA says Roundup weed killer is safe, in a win for Bayer",https://www.cbsnews.com,['Kate Gibson'],,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/roundup-weed-killer-is-safe-epa-says-giving-bayer-a-win/,"The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency gave Bayer a boost when it decided that its Roundup week killer didn't cause cancer.

Two recent court cases found just the opposite, ruling against Bayer and Roundup.

Environmental advocates, including the National Resources Defense Council, denounced the EPA's decision.

After two recent defeats in court, Bayer has won a round — this one delivered by regulators — as it contends with more than 10,000 lawsuits claiming a chemical in its widely used Roundup weed killer causes cancer. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on Tuesday said it ""continues to find that there are no risks to public health when glyphosate is used in accordance with its current label and that glyphosate is not a carcinogen.""

The agency said its findings were consistent with those of ""many other countries and other federal agencies."" But environmental advocates, including the National Resources Defense Council (NRDC) denounced the decision.

""Health agencies and credible non-industry experts who've reviewed this question have all found a link between glyphosate and cancer,"" Jennifer Sass, a senior scientist at NRDC said in a statement. The World Health Organization in 2015 termed glyphosate as ""probably carcinogenic to humans.""

Jury finds Monsanto's Roundup weed killer contributed to man's cancer

Bayer, which acquired Roundup in 2018 when it purchased U.S. agricultural chemical company Monsanto, called the agency's review ""significant,"" reiterating its stance that ""science supports the safety of glyphosate-based herbicide."" The EPA's stance reaffirmed earlier findings by the agency on the safety of the glyphosate, but it differs greatly from that of jury rulings in recent years that found the chemical caused cancer in two people.

Since acquiring Roundup with its purchase of Monsanto last year for $66 billion, Bayer's legal losses have helped knock $39 billion off its market value. In addition to lawsuits, Bayer has found itself trying to tamp down a bout of unwelcome PR that came with reports by consumer groups contending traces of the chemical were showing up in beer and wine, as well as some children's cereals. Bayer dismissed the claims as ""misleading.""

Glyphosate is the most widely used herbicide in U.S. agriculture. Beyond its use by farmers, Roundup is sprayed on golf courses and residential lawns to kill weeds.

Bayer has also helped finance damage control on behalf of Scotts Miracle-Gro, to which it licenses its consumer business. Scotts CEO Jim Hagedorn told analysts in a conference call that the controversy made the future less than clear. ""I can't predict that it's going to be as good next year,"" Hagedorn said Wednesday. ""It's the court of public opinion and consumers that matter here."""
U.S. DOJ Moves to Detain Defendant in Crypto ‘Shadow Banking’ Case,https://www.coindesk.com,[],05-02-2019,2019,5,https://www.coindesk.com/u-s-doj-moves-to-detain-defendant-in-crypto-shadow-banking-case,"U.S. prosecutors are seeking to detain Reginald Fowler until his trial for operating an unlicensed money transmission business which may have processed funds for the Bitfinex crypto exchange.

In a court filing Wednesday – which was shared online but is not yet available on the government’s Public Access to Court Electronic Records (PACER) system – first assistant U.S. Attorney Elizabeth Strange and assistant U.S. Attorney Gary Restaino detail concerns that Fowler may flee the country if he is not held in custody, citing his “disregard” for the FBI’s investigation last year.

Moreover, because “this scheme involves a staggering amount of money,” the U.S. government believes that Fowler may be able to avoid prosecution by accessing funds around the world.

“The government, through email search warrants, has obtained a document entitled ‘Master US Workbook,’ which details the financial operations of the scheme as of January 2019,” the filing says, adding:

“This workbook indicates that the scheme had received over $740 million in 2018 alone. It lists approximately sixty different bank accounts, held at both domestic and international banks, with a combined account balance of over $345 million as of January 2019. Notably, this workbook indicates that approximately $50 million is held in domestic accounts, with the rest located abroad.”

Fowler was charged with bank fraud, conspiracy to commit bank fraud and conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmission service earlier this week by the U.S Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York.

Alongside an associate, Tel Aviv-based Ravid Yosef, Fowler is alleged to have provided cryptocurrency exchanges with banking services illicitly and may be an operator of Crypto Capital, the payment processor at the heart of the Bitfinex/Tether scandal.

Indeed, the U.S. Department of Justice’s (DOJ) investigation may be one reason why Crypto Capital’s funds were frozen, which in turn hampered Bitfinex’s ability to process its customers’ withdrawals.

It was Bitfinex’s loss of access to some $850 million through Crypto Capital which resulted in its taking out a $625 million loan from Tether, the stablecoin issuer it is closely affiliated with.

The filing appears to confirm this, noting that “recent public reporting, which is corroborated in part through interviews conducted in the course of this investigation, indicates that companies associated with defendant have failed to return $851 million to a client of defendant’s shadow bank.”

Other crimes

Fowler may have also been involved in other crimes, the filing said. Roughly $14,000 in counterfeit bills – largely $100 bills – were recovered from Fowler’s office, indicating that he may have been involved in producing counterfeit money.

“Thus, it may be that this case is only one of multiple criminal and legal proceedings facing defendant,” the filing says.

Therefore, unless the prosecutors come to an agreement with Fowler with “a package of conditions,” his appearance at a hearing cannot be “reasonably assure[d],” and so he should be detained, Strange and Restaino wrote.

Homeland Security officials said Wednesday they will start an “unprecedented” pilot program to test the DNA of families arriving at the U.S. border as soon as next week, calling the measure an investigative tool to root out fraudulent cases of migrants traveling with children who are not their own.

Under the pilot program, Homeland Security investigators can request cheek-swab DNA samples if they suspect that an adult and a minor claiming to be family members do not in fact have a parent-child relationship.

A record number of Central American families have been crossing the southern border with Mexico in recent months, and DHS officials say the migrants are taking advantage of “loopholes” in the U.S. immigration system that enable those arriving with a child to avoid detention and swift deportation.

A private contractor, Ande, which specializes in “rapid DNA” screening for law enforcement and other government purposes, will conduct the DNA tests at the border. Results will be available in two hours, DHS officials said, after which samples and data will be destroyed.

“This pilot will help us determine whether this technology can strengthen our investigative processes and potentially rescue more children from dangerous situations,” said a DHS official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to brief reporters.

DHS officials said they have detected more than 1,000 cases of fraudulent families trying to cross the border since October, reaching that determination through document screenings and other traditional investigative methods. The agency has been reluctant to introduce DNA testing procedures, in part because of privacy and data storage concerns, officials said.

In some instances, migrant children are paired with uncles, cousins or other relatives who might not be a parent but are part of the same family. But there have been other, more worrisome allegations that some desperate families are accepting payment in exchange for allowing their children to travel with adults who view the minors as an entry ticket to the United States.

Jennifer Podkul, senior policy director at Kids in Need of Defense (KIND), said she is concerned that legitimate families — including those traveling with adopted children — could be separated because of the DNA tests.

“We have one case of a child who said, ‘That’s my dad,’ but didn’t know he was the stepfather,” she said. “That’s very different from being smuggled by a human trafficker.”

DHS officials say the DNA tests will be one of several investigative methods they will employ, and they will evaluate the full circumstances of suspected fraud cases to target criminal acts.

Homeland Security Investigations, the investigative arm of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), will lead the pilot program — not the U.S. Border Patrol. But officials said they view the program as a chance to evaluate its potential for expanded use.

HSI teams working on the pilot said they have interviewed 101 parents and children since April 18 who “presented indices of fraud,” and detected 29 families making false claims. From those investigations, 45 individuals were referred for prosecution and attorneys filed charges against 33, officials said.

If U.S. authorities determine that a child is not with a biological parent, they typically separate them and refer the minor to the Department of Health and Human Services, which operates a network of shelters of “unaccompanied” migrant children.

Other cases that DHS considers fraudulent involve parents arriving with children who claim to be underage but are, in fact, older than 18. And officials said document fraud is common at the border; homeland security officials say that corrupt officials in Central American countries — especially in Guatemala — have been issuing inexpensive fake birth certificates.

This year, unauthorized border crossings have surged to their highest levels in more than a decade, and U.S. authorities along the Mexico border detained more than 103,000 migrants in March. Nearly 60 percent were families, a greater share than ever, and large groups of migrants continue to cross the border and surrender to U.S. authorities, often to request asylum.

Many of the Central Americans say they are fleeing violence and desperate poverty, but there are financial incentives to bring children on the journey. Smuggling organizations offer discount pricing, because families need only be escorted to the U.S. border — not across it — so they can surrender to U.S. agents and start the asylum process."
William Barr’s Justice Department Just Filed the Most Nakedly Political Brief in the Agency’s History,https://slate.com,['Mark Joseph Stern'],05-02-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/05/william-barr-doj-obamacare-brief-partisan-hack.html,"Attorney General William Barr testifies before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday in Washington. Win McNamee/Getty Images

On Wednesday afternoon, after Attorney General William Barr finished his truculent and mendacious testimony before the Senate, the Department of Justice filed perhaps the most embarrassing, illogical, and nakedly political brief in the history of the agency. With Barr’s assent, the DOJ argued that the entire Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional because Congress zeroed out the individual mandate’s penalty in 2017. The timing couldn’t be worse. After obliterating his own credibility at the Senate hearing, Barr scorched the Justice Department’s legitimacy, deploying fatuous pseudo-legal arguments to further the Trump administration’s partisan goals. The DOJ will not soon recover from Wednesday’s body blow.

Texas v. United States, the latest assault on the ACA, is built upon a series of sophistries. The case was brought by a coalition of conservative states, led by Texas, which recruited two consultants to serve as plaintiffs. They assert that when Congress reduced the ACA’s penalty to zero dollars, it inadvertently destroyed the whole law—the tax credits, the exchanges, protections for preexisting conditions, Medicaid expansion, everything. According to Texas’ theory, the Supreme Court only upheld the ACA because it interpreted the penalty as a tax. But, they claim, a tax that collects zero dollars is not a true tax. So the individual mandate can no longer be viewed as a tax, rendering it unconstitutional. And because Congress never intended the ACA to function without the individual mandate, the rest of the law must be struck down too.

This leap in logic makes no sense. It is true that taxes typically collect revenue, so perhaps the mandate cannot fairly be called a tax anymore. It could even be true that the zeroed-out penalty is now unconstitutional. But that does not matter, because if the penalty is illegal, it should be severed from the rest of the law. As the Supreme Court recently explained, when one provision of a statute is invalidated, courts should preserve the remainder of the law unless it is “evident” that Congress “would not have enacted those provisions … independently.” In other words, courts that strike down part of a law should not eviscerate the rest of it without evidence that Congress would’ve wanted that extreme result.

Here, congressional intent is about as clear as it can get. In 2017, Congress declined to repeal the entire ACA but chose to zero out the individual mandate’s penalty in the tax bill. By doing so, it declared its belief that the law could function without an operative penalty, a lawful exercise of its legislative powers. But Texas claimed that by amending the ACA, Congress inadvertently demolished it, because the law cannot function without a penalty—even though Congress decided that it could. Thus, according to the plaintiffs, courts should simply sweep aside this legislative intent and invalidate the law top to bottom.

Congressional intent is about as clear as it can get.

In an opinion panned by liberals and conservatives alike, U.S. District Judge Reed O’Connor embraced this theory late last year and ruled that the entire ACA is unconstitutional. This view was too militant even for Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ Justice Department, which opted for a compromise position: It alleged that the mandate was unconstitutional but that only a few other provisions must fall with it. This half-measure was still a big deal, because the DOJ urged the courts to kill a centerpiece of the law: its bar on discrimination against people with preexisting conditions. And the DOJ’s brief at the time reflected, as University of Michigan law professor Nicholas Bagley put it, “enormous contempt for the rule of law.” It was, as other scholars noted, “excruciatingly stupid.” But at least the DOJ did not go whole hog, adopting Texas’ radical position that courts should reject Congress’ authority to amend its own law.

Until now. After Barr took control of the DOJ, the agency changed its position and has now told the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that Texas is right—the full ACA is now unconstitutional. With a straight face, the Justice Department argues that, by reducing the mandate to zero dollars, Congress gave Americans a “legal command” to buy health insurance. The Supreme Court has said that such a direct command would be unconstitutional because the mandate could only be justified as a tax. Moreover, the justices who discussed severability said that the ACA cannot function without the mandate. In sum, the DOJ wrote, the mandate is now illegal, it cannot be severed, and so the whole law is unconstitutional.

Where to begin with this lunacy? Start with the DOJ’s framing of the mandate as it stands now. As a factual matter, the ACA currently gives Americans a choice between buying health insurance and paying nothing. There’s no real dispute here; if you forgo insurance, you will suffer no legal consequences. Yet the DOJ interprets the mandate as a “command” that gives Americans “no choice” but to purchase insurance. And its brief insists that Congress created this command in its 2017 tax bill—even though legislators surely knew that the Supreme Court already ruled that such a command would be unconstitutional in 2012’s NFIB v. Sebelius.

It requires willing suspension of disbelief to surmise that by giving Americans a choice not to buy insurance by zeroing out the mandate, Congress actually gave them a “command” to insure themselves. And it taxes credulity to believe that Congress would create this “command” after the Supreme Court stated that such a rule would be unconstitutional.

But imagine for a moment that the DOJ is right—that the Republican-led Congress of 2017 didn’t actually relieve Americans of their duty to buy health insurance but forced them to do so (without any enforcement mechanism). If the courts must strike down this new “legal command,” why should the remainder of the law fall with it? After all, Congress obviously thought the ACA could function without a mandate that raises revenue. To square this circle, the DOJ repeatedly cites the dissent in NFIB, which proclaimed that the mandate could not be severed from the remainder of the law. The Justice Department seems to think that the view of four dissenting justices (in a 2012 case) can override the view of Congress (in 2017 legislation). It appears to have forgotten that a dissent is not law.

The zaniest portion of Wednesday’s brief, however, has to be its effort to salvage the few provisions of the ACA that the current administration likes. It does so by selectively raising the problem of standing. Now, in reality, the individual plaintiffs in this case—two consultants who don’t want to buy health insurance—shouldn’t have standing to sue at all. That requires an injury, and these plaintiffs have none, because they pay no penalty for forgoing insurance. The DOJ casts this problem aside by asserting that they are injured by the “legal command” to insure themselves. And its brief argues that the plaintiffs have standing “to challenge the numerous provisions of the ACA that work together to cause” this injury.

But in a puzzling paragraph, the DOJ adds that the plaintiffs do not have standing to challenge several provisions of the ACA that criminalize health care fraud. Why? The real answer is that the Justice Department is already prosecuting people under these provisions, and those prosecutions would be thwarted if the full law were struck down. But the DOJ avows that while the plaintiffs have standing to challenge almost the entire ACA, they can’t challenge these provisions because they do not “actually injure the individual plaintiffs.” Oh, really? So the rule that insurers not discriminate against people with preexisting conditions, and the tax credits for lower-income Americans, and the expansion of Medicaid in states other than Texas—all these provisions “actually injure” the plaintiffs? But prohibitions on fraud somehow do not? The DOJ makes no effort to defend this evanescent distinction, because it is indefensible.

Barr reportedly opposed adopting this preposterous position but caved to President Donald Trump’s demands. He deserves no credit for his feeble resistance. Barr owns this brief, and it will live on as a testament to his craven lawlessness long after the Supreme Court rejects its casuistry. The Justice Department’s reputation will take years to recover from this nadir, if it ever does. Barr marched his agency to the brink of illegitimacy."

REUTERS/Brian Snyder

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government will have to stop borrowing money between July and December if Washington doesn’t agree to raise a legal restriction on public debt, the Treasury Department said on Wednesday.

Hitting that so-called “debt ceiling” could trigger a U.S. default on its debt and an immediate recession, a risk that has become a regular facet of U.S. politics over the last decade.

The current debt limit was set in March. Treasury has been able to continue borrowing from investors by using accounting measures such as limiting government payments to public sector retirement funds.

“Treasury expects that the extraordinary measures will be exhausted sometime in the second half of 2019,” Treasury Deputy Assistant Secretary Brian Smith said in a statement announcing the department’s quarterly debt issuance plans.

Wall Street also sees Treasury exhausting its borrowing authority in the third or fourth quarter, according to the minutes of a meeting of a Treasury advisory committee of financiers.

The debt ceiling is already affecting how the government funds itself. Issuance of Treasury bills - short-term debt - is expected to gradually decline over the second quarter due to debt ceiling constraints, Smith said.

Treasury said it was holding issuance size steady for auctions of debt coupons during the third quarter, and that it anticipates no changes in the following three-month period either."
Presidents Should Not Investigate Themselves,https://www.nationalreview.com,"['Suranjan Sen', 'Victor Davis Hanson', 'David French', 'Rich Lowry', 'Jim Geraghty', 'Kevin D.

Congress and the people should police the executive.

How, exactly, does a man investigate himself?

This is the question that met President Trump from the moment he took office. As the FBI, the attorney general, and the special counsel all serve under the president’s authority, President Trump effectively held ultimate control over investigations into his own behavior. Then, while the Mueller report largely cleared President Trump of colluding with the Russians to influence the 2016 presidential election, it declined to reach any conclusion regarding whether Trump used his presidential power to obstruct the investigation. Hence, the discussion has moved from possible interference in the election, to possible interference in the investigation into possible interference in the election.

Forgive me for finding this entire scenario rather absurd.

The federal government’s tripartite structure imbues the president with the executive power, which includes prosecution. Neither the courts nor Congress may force an individual prosecution. Furthermore, any officer with prosecutorial discretion must, ultimately, be subject to the president’s supervision and removal. In turn, Congress and the people —through impeachment or the ballot box, respectively — may hold the president accountable for the abuse of this prosecutorial power.

We learned long ago that efforts to undermine this structure are dangerous. After the Watergate scandal, the Democratic Congress passed the Ethics in Government Act, creating the Office of Independent Counsel. Under this regime, either party in Congress could effectively require the judiciary to appoint an independent counsel to investigate and potentially prosecute any given matter. At the same time, the president (through the attorney general) could not remove the independent counsel absent “good cause.” This all but ensured an endless parade of unchecked, unaccountable independent counsels essentially harassing succeeding administrations. Following a series of expensive, disastrous investigations — most famously the Kenneth Starr investigation, which lead to the impeachment of President Clinton — both Republicans and Democrats agreed to let the act expire in 1999.

Yet, 20 years later, here we are. To be fair, the special counsel does not, on its face, pose the same constitutional issues presented by the independent counsels of yesteryear — Special Counsel Mueller was both appointed by the president (through Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein) and subject to the president’s at-will removal. As the president retains ultimate executive authority, the basic constitutional structure is preserved. However, this creates a new conceptual challenge: The special counsel effectively grants the president control over an investigation into himself.

This is the strange situation in which a president may act manifestly within his constitutional authority, yet be accused of obstructing justice. As a matter of constitutional law, President Trump could have removed Robert Mueller; he also had the power to fire James Comey and Jeff Sessions and was under no obligation to provide any reason whatsoever. These are all executive officers. But the issue of obstruction requires that we inquire into the president’s mental state, asking whether the president took an otherwise-lawful action with the intent of impeding the investigation. It’s a Rorschach test: Was Trump trying to “obstruct,” or was he simply making administrative decisions within his executive authority?

Whether or not this is constitutional, it is certainly not ideal. A president under investigation by his own branch of government may innocently make staffing changes, only to face impeachment or, more disturbingly, indictment under a subsequent administration. Or perhaps he might end an investigation he considers to be an expensive, unwieldy, partisan distraction, given that he knows he is innocent: Is that obstruction? Conversely, a guilty president may intentionally obstruct an investigation, yet plausibly deny such intent. In any case, the specter of future obstruction charges may, in practice, be just as constraining as the “good cause” requirement for removal of the independent counsels of old.

There are better ways to fight potential presidential corruption. First and foremost, we are fortunate to have a robust First Amendment that allows for vigorous criticism and truly independent, investigative journalism. This allows the American people to decide for themselves whether a presidential candidate or incumbent is corrupt or incompetent. Popular accountability is, ultimately, the cleanest and most natural protection against corruption within the elected branches.

Advertisement

Second, the Constitution grants Congress the power to conduct its own investigations. Congress may hold hearings and issue subpoenas, enforceable through contempt. Congress may then use the results of its investigations — or any unwillingness of the president or his subordinates to cooperate with such investigations — to justify impeachment, to pressure the executive into taking prosecutorial action, or to inform the voting public of possible executive corruption. Thus, executive corruption may be discovered and remedied without violating the formal, structural separation between the legislative and executive branches.

That said, the manner in which Congress currently exercises its oversight authority is in dire need of reform. Note that congressional investigations into the Trump administration’s alleged ties with Russia did occur, and to a large extent the results of these investigations fell on deaf ears. With good reason, onlookers are suspicious of congressional investigations into the president as being little more than either partisan witch hunts or rubber stamps, depending on whether the president’s party controls the relevant chamber.

Advertisement

But Congress itself can work to obviate these concerns. Either chamber may facilitate investigation into the president by, for example, creating a bipartisan standing committee whose members are selected by opposing parties, or whose chair must belong to the party in opposition to the president. Further, Congress may delegate its investigatory authority to another body, which then reports its findings to committee or to the chamber as a whole. In fact, Congress could even have appointed Robert Mueller to investigate the Trump administration, and while Mueller would not have had prosecutorial authority, he could have enjoyed Congress’s delegated authority to issue enforceable subpoenas. Had this been the case, we would be exactly where we are now, but without the trail of process crimes and, more important, without having to discuss whether the president attempted to obstruct the investigation.

Congressional oversight of the executive branch can work. Congress has successfully utilized its investigative power since the administration of George Washington. A century ago, it was a congressional investigation that uncovered criminal wrongdoing connected to the Teapot Dome scandal. Within living memory, a Senate committee uncovered evidence of presidential corruption related to Watergate. Neither corruption nor partisanship are new phenomena; there is no reason why the modern Congress should be unable to investigate the president on its own.

Regardless of whether President Trump attempted to obstruct justice, he never should have been supervising an investigation into himself. Policing the executive is a role for Congress, and, ultimately, the American people. We decided this two centuries ago, we rediscovered it two decades ago, and now we are discovering it yet again. Let this be the time we finally learn our lesson."
Dems grill top Interior lawyer alongside nominee who will investigate him,https://thehill.com,[],05-02-2019,2019,5,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/441843-dems-grill-interior-lawyer-alongside-next-department-investigator,"Senate Democrats had tough questions Thursday for the nominee to lead the Department of Interior’s legal department and the inspector general nominee who would start the job by investigating him.

Seated together at the witness table at the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee hearing were Daniel Jorjani, the Department of Interior’s main legal adviser, and Mark Lee Greenblatt, who has been nominated to take over the office responsible for sorting through a number of potential ethical lapses from Interior’s highest-level employees.

The committee’s Republican members were largely absent from the meeting as Democrats narrowed in on a variety of ethical issues that have come up at Interior under Jorjani, who has been formally nominated to be Interior’s solicitor but is already serving in the position.

“Mr. Greenblatt, if you’re confirmed, you’re going to have your work cut out for you,” Wyden said later. “I want to know what you’re going to do to maintain your independence and avoid an appointee like Mr. Jorjani attempting to interfere with your work.”

The hearing provided an interesting look at two roles that are often in conflict.

“It’s certainly not a sleepy office, let’s put it that way,” Greenblatt told The Hill. “There are emerging issues that are of intense public debate.”

“What the hell do you mean by that?” King asked. “Doesn’t that imply disrespect for the Office of the Inspector General?”

“I can only say I have the highest level of respect for the Office of the Inspector General,” Jorjani said.

“I can only say that’s inconsistent with what you said in your email,” King replied.

Jorjani’s career was dissected by the Democratic members, ranging from his time working for groups backed by the conservative Koch brothers to decisions he has made while working for the department.

“I’m not aware of any particular industry that benefits from this, I’d like to think the American people benefit,” Jorjani said, before being cut off by Hirono.

“Yes, I’d like to think so too, but you cannot escape the conclusion that the people you used to work for before — the Koch brothers — said this is one of their biggest issues they wanted to have done away with,” Hirono said. “So I’d say the oil and gas industries are the biggest beneficiaries.”

Another chief concern of Democratic senators involved Jorjani’s dual role as head of the office that oversees public records requests.

Wyden said Jorjani was using that role to hinder investigations, holding back necessary documents.

“By my count there are four investigations that were closed or found inconclusive based on a lack of cooperation,” Wyden said, resurfacing a 2017 email from Jorjani that said it was his job to “protect the Secretary.”

“Last time I looked, Interior lawyers are responsible for protecting the best interests of the American people before those of the secretary or special interests,” Wyden said. “I found that comment especially troubling.”

Jorjani said that comment was directed at a political appointee for his poor use of taxpayer money, something Jorjani said would damage the image of the department."
DOJ lays out case for striking down Obamacare in its entirety,https://www.cnn.com,"['Ariane De Vogue', 'Cnn Supreme Court Reporter']",05-01-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/01/politics/affordable-care-act-lawsuit-trump/index.html,"(CNN) The Trump administration offered its first full argument Wednesday for its reversal on the Affordable Care Act, arguing in new court filings that the entire law ""should not be allowed to remain in effect.""

The government argues in the filings that the so-called ""individual mandate"" requiring Americans to have coverage is unconstitutional and that the rest of the law should therefore also be struck down, even if the government ""might support some individual provisions as a policy matter.""

The landmark legislation provides health care coverage to millions of Americans.

In the filing, Assistant Attorney General Joseph Hunt acknowledged that the administration had previously argued that parts of the law could remain in effect even if the individual mandate were struck down, but he said, the administration had come to believe it could no longer defend that position. He suggested that rewriting the statute by ""picking and choosing which provisions to invalidate"" would interfere with the role of Congress and the ""proper course"" for the courts would be to strike down the law in its entirety.

The brief was filed with the conservative-leaning 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals, which will hear arguments in July and possibly tee up a Supreme Court case next term that could finally decide the fate of the law and render a decision during the heart of the presidential election.

Trump’s Labor Department weighed in on gig workers’ rights.,https://www.vox.com,['May'],05-01-2019,2019,5,https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/5/1/18525459/gig-economy-labor-department-trump-uber-lyft-doordash-taskrabbit,"Approximately 57 million people in the US do some sort of work in the gig economy. Some of them drive cars for Uber and Lyft, deliver groceries for Instacart and Doordash, walk dogs for Wag and Rover, clean houses through Task Rabbit and Handy, and manage apartment properties on Airbnb.

The market has grown quickly over the past few years, bringing in as much as $864 billion annually, according to some estimates. And with it, there’s been a lot of talk about the rights of these workers. They’ve been fighting for fair treatment for a while now; since they’re considered contractors, they don’t get benefits like insurance, worker’s comp, or paid vacation. Sociologists, labor experts, and economists have all weighed in on the issue, largely agreeing that gig workers deserve the same fair treatment as regular employees.

On April 29, the United States Labor Department offered its own interpretation on the matter. After a lawyer working for an unnamed cleaning company reached out to clarify how gig workers should be classified, the department responded in a letter that’s since been posted online. In the letter, the Labor Department said it classifies gig workers as contractors, not employees:

“Based on the facts you provide in your letter, it appears that the service providers who use your client’s virtual marketplace are independent contractors. Your client provides a referral service. As such, it does not receive services from service providers, but empowers service providers to provide services to end-market consumers.”

The letter could have huge implications for the future of the gig economy. It essentially renders gig workers exempt from the Fair Labor Standards Act, a law written in 1938 that guarantees overtime pay and a minimum wage to many who work more than 40 hours.

It’s caused plenty of disagreement. On Monday, the National Employment Law Project tweeted that the letter essentially allows gig economy companies to “underpay and overwork” this class of workers.

DOL opinion letter attempts to allow an unnamed #GigEconomy company to underpay and overwork its workers by misclassifying them as independent contractors. But if workers have all the restrictions of employees, they should get the protections. https://t.co/b6m5NFlFaF — NELP (@NelpNews) April 29, 2019

So what’s the department’s logic? It reasoned that, because the unnamed cleaning company doesn’t pay for professional certification, licensing, or let workers expense products, they should clearly be seen as contractors. It also points out that since workers don’t have set hours or shifts, they should be free to “pursue any and all external opportunities at their leisure,” which means that the company should not be seen as the main party responsible for them.

This type of reasoning is pretty different from how the Labor Department under Barack Obama’s administration viewed the gig economy. In 2015, for example, it issued a new interpretation of the word “employ,” writing that the administration believes “most workers” should be included in the FSLA. Obama’s Labor Department called on Uber and Lyft to reconsider how they classify their workers, pointing out that one crucial detail in the debate of contractor versus employee was whether the workers are “integral,” and that drivers were, indeed, integral to Uber and Lyft.

This opinion, though, has all but been abandoned by the Trump administration, as the New York Times points out. Trump’s Labor Department largely tossed Obama’s favorable interpretations of gig workers in favor of Silicon Valley.

The Labor Department’s letter does not necessarily represent the law; the opinion currently only applies to the unnamed cleaning company that had written to the agency. But as Reuters notes, though, it “can be presented in court to boost claims by plaintiffs or defendants in cases involving similar issues.”

Public opinion can work in favor of these workers’ rights, however. Back in February, for example, grocery delivery app users were outraged to learn about allegations of tipping theft at Instacart and DoorDash, and vowed to stop using these services. This response led Instacart to revamp its tipping policy. Uber and Lyft, too, have responded to public pressure, and agreed in December 2018 to pay drivers in New York City a minimum wage of $17.22 an hour. So even if the current administration isn’t on the side of gig workers, outside pressure could still result in change.

Horowitz has been looking into possible Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act abuse for more than a year. Barr told the Senate Judiciary Committee Wednesday that he was looking into the origins of the investigation into Trump, any criminal leaks from the FBI or DOJ to the media, the possibility the ""Steele dossier"" — compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele — was Russian disinformation, and more.

Barr said: ""I talked to Mike Horowitz a few weeks ago about it. It's focused on the FISA, basis for the FISA and handling of the FISA applications. But by necessity, it looks back a little earlier than that. The people helping me with my review will be working very closely with Mr. Horowitz.""

He suggested the investigation into Trump may be broader than previously thought: “Many people seem to assume that the only intelligence collection that occurred was a single confidential informant and a FISA warrant. I would like to find out whether that is, in fact, true. It strikes me as a fairly anemic effort if that was the counterintelligence effort to stop the threat as it is being represented.

“As I've said before, the extent there was any overreach I believe it was a few people in the upper echelons of the bureau and perhaps the department. But those people are no longer there, and I'm working closely with [FBI Director] Chris Wray, who I think has done a superb job at the bureau, and we're working together on trying to reconstruct exactly what went down.”

Earlier in the hearing, Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., asked, “Do you share my concerns about the FISA process?”

Barr replied simply: “Yes.”

The Steele dossier was used in applications to the FISA Court to justify warrants against at least one Trump associate, Carter Page. Steele was paid for his research by Fusion GPS, an opposition research firm that was funded in part by the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee through the Perkins Coie law firm.

Steele has come under increased scrutiny, with Barr saying Wednesday the DOJ is now investigating whether his dossier was based in part upon Russian disinformation.

Last year, Horowitz announced the launch of the FISA abuse investigation after requests from both then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Republican members of Congress. The lawmakers claimed the Justice Department and FBI had abused the FISA process and misled the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court in their investigation and surveillance of Trump and his associates during the campaign, as well as during the Trump administration.

Horowitz said he would “examine the Justice Department’s and the FBI’s compliance with legal requirements, and with applicable DOJ and FBI policies and procedures, in applications filed with the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court relating to a certain U.S. person [Page].”

He stated that he would “review information that was known to the DOJ and the FBI at the time the applications were filed from or about an alleged FBI confidential source. Additionally, the OIG will review the DOJ’s and FBI’s relationship and communications with the alleged source as they relate to the FISC applications.” This “alleged FBI confidential source” is Steele.

Barr, who stood by his use of the word “spying” in front of the Senate Wednesday, said the DOJ inspector general report could be in by the end of June."
State Department official has a really racist take on U.S.-China relations,https://thinkprogress.org,[],,,,https://thinkprogress.org/state-department-official-makes-xenophobic-argument-against-confronting-china-on-human-rights-aae491dfb32b/,"On Monday evening, a State Department official claimed that the United States can’t focus on human rights if it wants to combat China — and that China presents the first time the United States has faced a great power competitor that isn’t “Caucasian.”

The comments from Kiron Skinner, the State Department’s director of policy planning, came during the New America Future Security Forum in Washington.

Questioned by New America CEO Anne-Marie Slaughter about the Trump administration’s China policy, Skinner attempted to draw a clear line between American policy regarding the Soviet Union and the United States’ developing policy regarding China.

However, instead of focusing solely on economic competition or Chinese territorial aggression in places like the South China Sea, Skinner discussed how China presents a different “civilization” than previous adversaries like the USSR. According to Skinner, U.S. efforts to highlight Soviet human rights abuses — including the United States’ push for the landmark Helsinki Final Act in 1975, which pledged support for human rights — helped topple the USSR in 1991. However, focusing on highlighting China’s human rights abuses is apparently a futile task.

Said Skinner:

Not to make light of the Cold War, and the reality of nuclear war that could have happened — and the fact that we came close in some instances — but when we think about the Soviet Union and that competition, in a way it was a fight within the Western family. Karl Marx was a German Jew who developed a philosophy that was really within the larger body of political thought … that has some tenets even within classical liberalism. And so, in that way, I think it was a huge fight within the Western family. And you could look at the Soviet Union — part West, part East — but it had some openings there that got us the Helsinki Final Act in 1975, which was a really important Western concept that opened the door really to undermine the Soviet Union, a totalitarian state, on human rights principles. That’s not really possible with China. This is a fight with a really different civilization, and a different ideology, and the United States hasn’t had that before.

It’s unclear why focusing on China’s human rights abuses — which Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has actually done, especially as it pertains to China’s internment camps for Muslims — is futile.

A State Department spokesperson did not respond to questions on Skinner’s comments.

Disturbing. Leaders at the @StateDep seem to think that ""human rights"" is a ""Western"" idea. There's nothing ""Chinese"" about China's Leninist one-party system. Chinese who are not directly under the CCP's rule are among the most rights-respecting people. https://t.co/oFNiG9ZsBN — Yaqiu Wang 王亚秋 (@Yaqiu) May 1, 2019

Slaughter, who was the director of policy planning under the Obama administration, followed up by asking if Skinner’s discussion of China’s “different civilization” relied on political scientist Samuel Huntington’s maligned theory of a “Clash of Civilizations.”

“Some of those tenets, but a little bit different,” Skinner replied.

Memorialized in a 1996 book by a similar name, Huntington’s theory posits a number of different “civilizations” across the world, ranging from “Western” to “Buddhist.” Few geopolitical theories have fallen from favor more swiftly than Huntington’s, not least because of the countries Huntington tried to lump together — or break apart, depending on the country’s supposed “civilization.” For instance, Huntington claimed Papua New Guinea was part of a “Western” civilization, while Kazakhstan remained “Orthodox.” Huntington even claimed that countries as distant as Mauritania and Indonesia were, in reality, part of the same “civilization,” but that countries like Guyana or Bosnia and Herzegovina comprised multiple “civilizations” within them.

5. Either Tibet should be Sinic or Xinjiang Muslim.

6. If Kenya's Muslim minority should be green, so should Ethiopia's.

7. Papua New Guinea is not Western.

8. Sierra Leone is mostly Muslim.

9. Guinea-Bissau is half Muslim. All this even if we accept Huntington on his own terms. — Gennady Rudkevich (@grudkev) April 11, 2019

Skinner also claimed that China presented the first time that the United States faced a great power competitor who isn’t white.

“I think it’s also striking that it’s the first time that we will have a great power competitor that is not Caucasian,” Skinner said.

If accurate, this is a rather appalling, racist-based assessment of the nature of the Chinese threat. And coming from the State Dept. makes it even worse. Apparently the problem is not CN’s system; it’s Chinese culture? We sink to new lows every day. https://t.co/g9vpu80Web — Michael D. Swaine (@Dalzell60) May 1, 2019

Skinner is incorrect: In addition to the multi-ethnic nature of the Soviet Union — one-third of the post-Soviet countries are in Central Asia, after all — the United States‘ predominant rivalry during the first few decades of the 20th century centered on countering Japan in the Pacific theater. Even prior to the events that led to the bombing of Pearl Harbor and the Philippines, which remained an American colony through the Second World War, American administrations were so concerned about Japanese threats in the Pacific that they actively lobbied for domestic legislation to assuage Japanese concerns — with President Teddy Roosevelt even advocating for racial equality on the West Coast in order not to anger the Japanese government.

But Skinner, one of the United States‘ most prominent State Department officials, has apparently forgotten that history. Skinner’s comments not only severely misread American history, but they are also based one of the most flawed theories on international relations of the past few decades — all at the expense of diminishing the push for human rights in the world’s most populous country."
SECURITY: 'Cyber event' disrupted U.S. grid networks — DOE,https://www.eenews.net,['Blake Sobczak'],,,,https://www.eenews.net/stories/1060242741,"This story was updated at 12:20 p.m. EDT.

A ""cyber event"" interrupted grid operations in parts of the western United States last month, according to a cryptic report posted by the Department of Energy.

The March 5 incident lasted from 9 a.m. until nearly 7 p.m. but didn't lead to a power outage, based on a brief summary of the electric disturbance report filed by the victim utility.

If remote hackers interfered with grid networks in California, Utah and Wyoming, as the DOE filing suggests, the event would be unprecedented. A cyberattack is not known to have ever disrupted the flow of electricity anywhere in the United States, though Russian hackers briefly cut off power to parts of Ukraine in 2015 and again in 2016.

DOE uses a broad definition of ""cyber event,"" describing it as any disruption to an electrical system or grid communication network ""caused by unauthorized access"" to hardware, software or data. That leaves open the possibility that a utility employee or trespasser, rather than a remote hacker, triggered the March 5 event.

In January 2018, for instance, Michigan utility Consumers Energy filed the same type of DOE notice when an employee in training accidentally caused a blackout for about 15,000 people (Energywire, March 8, 2018).

""There was no malicious intent"" in that case, a spokeswoman said at the time, and Consumers Energy brought the lights back on within a few hours.

U.S. utilities are required to notify DOE within one hour of any successful cyberattack on their systems. Power companies that fail to file an OE-417 electric disturbance report can be fined up to $2,500 per day, although DOE has never issued civil or criminal penalties related to the form. The document is supposed to include a high-level overview of the incident, whether it be a hurricane-related outage or a physical attack on the facility. A second, more closely guarded portion of the form contains a detailed summary of actions taken to resolve the incident and ""preliminary results from any investigations,"" per DOE guidelines.

DOE didn't respond to request for comment. A spokesman for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, whose analysts routinely access OE-417 data, said ""the commission was aware of the situation"" but declined to pass on any additional information. A spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency deferred comment to DOE. A spokeswoman for the North American Electric Reliability Corp., which sets and enforces physical and cybersecurity standards under the oversight of FERC, did not respond to a request for comment.

The Western Electricity Coordinating Council, the NERC affiliate responsible for monitoring grid reliability and security across western North America, declined to share additional context.

WECC's events analysis team ""confirmed it was a single entity involved,"" Communications Manager Julie Booth said in an email. ""For security purposes, we cannot disclose any further information beyond what has already been made public.""

Relatively few organizations would have an electricity service footprint that spans Salt Lake County, Utah; Converse County, Wyo.; and both Los Angeles and Kern counties in California.

Peak Reliability, a Western transmission operator, spans 14 states including Utah, Colorado and California. A spokesperson for that nonprofit reliability coordinator did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The Western Area Power Administration, one of four federally owned power marketing organizations in the United States, similarly maintains grid assets in those three states. A WAPA spokeswoman said the agency didn't file the report.

Berkshire Hathaway Energy, through its subsidiaries PacifiCorp and BHE Renewables LLC, would also fit the vague description included on the OE-417 form.

A spokeswoman for Berkshire Hathaway Energy said none of the firm's subsidiaries were affected by the event."
Top Veterans Affairs official hits back at AOC's claim the VA doesn't have enough money,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],04-30-2019,2019,4,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/top-va-official-hits-back-at-aocs-claim-the-va-doesnt-have-enough-money,"Richard Stone, the Department of Veterans Affairs executive in charge, poked a hole in Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's claim the agency is not fully funded.

Stone was asked Monday during a House Committee on Veterans’ Affairs hearing on the trend of veterans committing suicide and, specifically, addressing the recent number of veterans committing suicide on VA property.

""I think having sat through the last couple hours here with me, you understand, well understand very well my answer. This is not a financial problem,"" said Stone. ""This is a problem of the society that we live in. And this is about the interpersonal connections that we each have, to each other as a society.

""I can hire another 20,000 mental health providers and what I can say to you is that people in crisis will get great care. And they will come in or be seen in the same day as they are today,"" Stone said. ""I can hire additional people for at risk, but this is about moving to the left, moving towards the fact that we need to reduce risk. And it goes back to your colleagues’ comments earlier about whole health and identifying what connects us as humans, to other humans, and finding stabilization, as a society, that is much different than it was for those veterans that came home 30, 40, and 50 years ago.""

[Related: Veterans slam Ocasio-Cortez for her fierce defense of the VA]

During the hearing, the VA officials noted how of the more than 20 veterans who commit suicide every day, only a fraction of them are receiving care through the VA, with a majority never accessing the resources available to them.

The hearing took place hours after a veteran committed suicide at the Cleveland VA Medical Center, according to Fox 8.

After the hearing, Stone told the Washington Examiner the issue of veteran suicide is a multifaceted one that money alone cannot solve.

""Ten years ago we had a $4 billion budget for mental health, today I have an $8.9 billion budget for mental health,"" he said. ""I've doubled the number of mental health providers over these years, but yet we haven't changed the suicide rate. What I'm saying this is not just about adding more personnel. Certainly we can always add more personnel and we can go move from one to two day wait time for mental health.""

When asked by another reporter what the VA needs from Congress right now, instead of saying money, Stone said the bureaucracy needs be clearer and faster on certain issues.

""No. 1, we need clarity on the never-activated guardsmen and reservists: Are they veterans or aren't they veterans? Should they be allowed to come in?"" he said. ""Our option is, we're here. We have an established system. These are people who had served in uniform. The fact they just weren't activated shouldn't keep them from coming in.""

Stone said it takes too long to build new intake centers, as approval can take four to seven years before construction begins: ""We need to be much more agile in that.""

Stone's comments are in stark contrast to New York Democrat Ocasio-Cortez's insistence that the VA is not fully funded, at least when it comes to preventing veteran suicide.

Like many public systems, GOP want to rip the battery out + say the whole car doesn’t work, so they can sell it for parts.

"EPA: Glyphosate, the Herbicide in Roundup, Does Not Cause Cancer",https://www.usnews.com,[],04-30-2019,2019,4,https://www.usnews.com/news/national-news/articles/2019-04-30/epa-glyphosate-the-herbicide-in-roundup-does-not-cause-cancer,"The EPA deemed Tuesday that glyphosate, an ingredient in the Monsanto-made herbicide Roundup, does not cause cancer. Reed Saxon/AP

The Environmental Protection Agency on Tuesday reaffirmed its finding that the most widely used herbicide in the country does not cause cancer.

Glyphosate does not pose a public health risk when used as directed, EPA found in its proposed interim registration review , which is the latest step in the agency's review process for the herbicide.

""The agency's scientific findings on human health risk are consistent with the conclusions of science reviews by many other countries and other federal agencies,"" EPA said in a press release.

This finding comes roughly a month after a federal jury awarded a California man $80 million in damages after finding that the popular weed killer Roundup, which contains glyphosate, played a substantial role in his non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Bayer, the company that owns Roundup's producer, Monsanto, is appealing the verdict. Thousands of similar cases are pending at the federal and state level.

The latest step affirms EPA's findings in its preliminary risk assessments from 2017.

Many public comments on the agency's preliminary risk assessments focused on the herbicide's possible cancer risk as well as its potential harm to monarch butterflies and pollinators like bees. EPA responded to the comments in its proposed interim registration review, saying that there are scientific uncertainties behind the decline of monarch and pollinator populations.

The proposed interim registration review found that ""the benefits that glyphosate confers to growers outweigh the geographically limited risks to non-target organisms.""

It did identify potential risks to mammals and birds, but said these would be limited to at or near the application area of the pesticide. The agency is proposing spray drift management measures to reduce risk to non-target organisms.

Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue cheered the finding, saying it is based on science and consistent with the findings of other regulatory authorities.

""If we are going to feed 10 billion people by 2050, we are going to need all the tools at our disposal, which includes the use [of] glyphosate,"" Perdue said.

Green groups continue to stand by research that ties glyphosate to cancer, specifically non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

""Health agencies and credible non-industry experts who've reviewed this question have all found a link between glyphosate and cancer,"" said Jennifer Sass, a senior scientist at the Natural Resources Defense Council. ""EPA should take the advice of its own science advisors—who have rejected the agency's no-cancer-risk classification.""

Environmental Working Group, an activist group that petitioned EPA to reduce the tolerance level of glyphosate in food like oats, pointed to a toxicological report on glyphosate from an arm of the Department of Health and Human Services that found that ""a possible association between exposure to glyphosate and risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma could not be ruled out, based on conflicting results.""

""We think EPA's finding is not accurate and makes the rest of the risk assessment hard to interpret,"" says Alexis Temkin, a toxicologist for the Environmental Working Group.

Registered pesticides must undergo review at least once every 15 years. EPA's review process for glyphosate is intended to make sure that as changes in science, public policy and pesticide use occurs, ""products in the marketplace can continue to be used safely,"" according to EPA.

EPA plans to release a decision in late 2019 with enforceable restrictions for the use of glyphosate.

Once the notice is published in the Federal Register, the public will have 60 days to comment on it.

Schiff refers Blackwater founder Prince to DOJ over alleged false statements to Congress,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Brooke Singman', 'Brooke Singman Is A Politics Reporter For Fox News. Follow Her On Twitter At']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/schiff-refers-blackwater-founder-erik-prince-to-doj-over-alleged-false-statements-to-congress,"House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., formally referred Blackwater founder Erik Prince to the Justice Department for a criminal investigation over whether Prince lied to the panel about a 2016 meeting in the Seychelles islands with a Russian banker tied to Vladimir Putin.

In a statement, the committee said it had “identified at least six categories of materially false statements” Prince made about the meeting with Kirill Dmitriev when he appeared before the committee in November 2017.

In a letter to Attorney General William Barr, Schiff said Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report on allegations of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian officials “strongly indicates that Erik Prince knowingly and willfully provided materially false testimony,” which Schiff argued “hindered the Committee’s ability to fully understand and examine foreign efforts to undermine our political process and national security, develop appropriate legislative and policy remedies to counter future malign influence operations targeting campaigns and presidential transitions, and inform the American public, as appropriate.”

SCHIFF HEDGES ON TRUMP IMPEACHMENT, SAYS INSTEAD, 'VOTE HIS A-- OUT OF OFFICE'

“I do believe that there is very strong evidence that he willingly misled the committee and willingly made false statements to the committee,” Schiff told The Washington Post’s Bob Costa during a panel event earlier Tuesday.

“The evidence is so weighty that the Justice Department needs to consider this. His testimony, which I can discuss because it is public record, was that his meeting in Seychelles with this Russian banker [Dmitriev] was purely by chance. He just happened to go to Seychelles for about a day and have a chance meeting with the Russian banker.”

Prince, the founder of the private military contractor Blackwater, and the brother of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, testified in 2017 that the meeting with the Russian banker was a chance encounter. Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report revealed that the meeting was set up ahead of time.

“We know from the Mueller report that this was not a chance meeting,” Schiff said Tuesday. “We know there were communications after he returned.”

Schiff added that Prince had “discussions” with former White House adviser Steve Bannon about the meeting before he left, and “communications” after he returned from the meeting, a claim the lawmaker said was contradicted by the Mueller report.

SCHIFF REFUSES TO BACK DOWN ON CLAIMS AGAINST TRUMP, SAYS HE HAS NO REGRETS

“Somehow, mysteriously, magically, the communications between Prince and Bannon have apparently fled their devices,” Schiff said. “In very material ways, I think the evidence strongly suggests that he willingly misled our committee and the Justice Department needs to consider whether there’s a prosecutable case.”

Schiff added that when Bannon appeared before his committee, he “refused to answer almost all of our questions.”

“He said he was not answering questions because the White House asked him not to,” Schiff said.

Schiff was also asked whether his panel felt that President Trump’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., or his son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner gave false testimony.

“I don’t want to comment on any others. We have reached the point of ripeness with Prince’s testimony that we feel it appropriate to refer it,” Schiff said. “I don’t want to comment on any others.”

Schiff’s comments come in the midst of a heated battle between Congress and the White House over subpoenas for former and current officials to testify before House committees leading sweeping Trump-focused probes. Schiff’s panel is currently investigating the president’s finances.

Senate Fails to Override Trump’s Yemen Veto,https://www.usnews.com,[],05-02-2019,2019,5,https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2019-05-02/senate-fails-to-override-trumps-yemen-veto,"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) urged his colleagues to reject the override vote, Thursday, to block President Donald Trump's veto that would end U.S. military assistance in Saudi Arabia's war in Yemen. (NICHOLAS KAMM/AFP/Getty Images)

The GOP-controlled Senate on Thursday fell short of overriding President Donald Trump's veto against a resolution that ends U.S. support for a Saudi-led military campaign in Yemen, which is considered the worst humanitarian crisis in the world.

In a 53-45 vote, the Senate didn't garner the two-thirds of support, or 67 votes, needed to block the president's veto. Seven Republicans joined all Senate Democrats to override Trump's veto.

Both chambers of Congress made history by using the War Powers Act of 1973 for the first time to cease military support for a foreign war. Yemen's four-year civil war has been deemed by the U.N. as the worst humanitarian crisis in the word amid famine and civilian deaths.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., urged his colleagues to reject the override vote. Republican critics of the resolution have argued that it fails to address threats posed by Iran.

""Abandoning our Saudi partners and Yemini partners is hardly the way to give them the confidence to take the hard diplomatice steps that are necessary,"" McConnell said on the Senate floor prior to the vote. ""An abrupt withdrawal would be good news for Iran, the Houthi rebels they support and for al-Qaida as well.""

The adoption of the Yemen resolution in both chambers was a rare moment of rebuke against the president, particularly in the GOP-led Senate. The White House signaled its intention to block the measure and in mid-April, issued the second veto of his presidency.

""This resolution is an unnecessary, dangerous attempt to weaken my constitutional authorities, endangering the lives of American citizens and brave service members, both today and in the future,"" Trump said after he vetoed the measure.

A Saudi-led coalition intervened in Yemen's civil war in 2015 on behalf of the country's internationally recognized government against Iranian-backed Houthi rebels who had taken the capital and ousted the country's president. But the Saudis, who employ U.S.-provided weapons and intelligence, have faced international condemnation for the indiscriminate killing of civilians and for the deterioration of humanitarian conditions.

The resolution has also been seen as a congressional vehicle to ramp up pressure on Saudi Arabia after the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. U.S. intelligence concluded that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered the journalist's assassination. But Trump has appeared reluctant to directly call him out.

Trump's veto of the Yemen resolution came a month after he issued the first veto of his presidency against a disapproval resolution that would have blocked his emergency declaration at the southern border to appropriate funds for a border wall.

State Department preparing for clash of civilizations with China,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],04-30-2019,2019,4,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/defense-national-security/state-department-preparing-for-clash-of-civilizations-with-china,"Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s team is developing a strategy for China based on the idea of “a fight with a really different civilization” for the first time in American history.

“This is a fight with a really different civilization and a different ideology and the United States hasn't had that before,” Kiron Skinner, the director of policy planning at the State Department, said Monday evening at a security forum in Washington, D.C.

Skinner is leading an effort to develop a concept of U.S.-China relations on the scale of what she called “Letter X” — the unsigned essay by George Kennan, who assessed “the sources of Soviet conduct” in 1947 and outlined the containment strategy that guided American strategists for the rest of the Cold War. China poses a unique challenge, she said, because the regime in Beijing isn’t a child of Western philosophy and history.

“The Soviet Union and that competition, in a way it was a fight within the Western family,” Skinner said, noting Karl Marx’s indebtedness to Western political ideas. “It’s the first time that we will have a great power competitor that is not Caucasian.”

Skinner credited retired Army Gen. H.R. McMaster, who served as White House national security adviser from March 2017 to March 2018, with recognizing the need for a National Security Strategy organized around the return of great power competition with Russia and China. But those two rivals are not equivalent, she said, identifying Russia as a mere “global survivor” that pales in comparison to China.

[Related: Pompeo: China threatens 'our continued democracy']

“We see it as a more fundamental long-term threat,” Skinner told New America CEO Anne Marie Slaughter. “In China, we have an economic competitor, we have an ideological competitor, one that really does seek a global reach that many of us didn't expect a couple of decades ago.”

Slaughter, who served as the head of policy planning for the State Department from 2009 to 2011, suggested that Skinner was offering the U.S.-China relationship as the ""clash of civilizations"" outlined in another landmark essay that discussed how geopolitics would change after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Skinner concurred.

""Some of those tenets, but a little bit different,"" she answered. ""I think we have to take the rose-colored glasses off and get real about the nature of the threat. And, I think we also have to give a kind of respect for, I think, what the Chinese seek to accomplish.""

Trump has made a trade war with China one of the major undertakings of his administration, in pursuit of a trade deal to rebalance the relationship between the world’s two largest economies. U.S. officials have also rebranded the Asia Pacific region as the Indo-Pacific, partly as a nod to China’s surge in Africa and the potential for India to function as a counter-weight to the Communist power.

But Pompeo has sounded the alarm about China’s influence around the world, warning of security threats in Europe and the Arctic, as well as predatory lending in the Western Hemisphere.

“Trade is not the only problem and maybe not the biggest in the long run with China,” Skinner said. “But we're now looking more deeply and broadly at China. And, I think State is in the lead in that broader attempt to get something like a Letter X for China, what Kennan wrote. You can't have a policy without an argument underneath it.”

Pompeo’s team has rebuked China repeatedly for human rights abuses, especially the hostility to religious beliefs displayed by the regime’s mass detention of Uighur Muslims and the persecution of Christians and other religious minorities. But Skinner suggested that human rights arguments might not be as useful against China as they were against the Soviet Union, which was weakened by a 1975 agreement that allowed Soviet dissidents to cooperate indirectly with Western powers to advocate for “the rights of emigration and religious freedom,” according to the State Department.

“It was a really important Western concept that opened the door really to undermine the Soviet Union, a totalitarian state, on human rights principles,” she said. “That's not really possible with China.”"

MADISON, Wis. - Democratic Attorney General Josh Kaul has changed the state Department of Justice stance to support an environmental advocacy group in lawsuits dealing with dairy farm expansion and high-capacity wells.

Environmental group Clean Wisconsin filed a lawsuit in 2015 challenging the DNR's decision to allow a farm in Kewaunee County to expand.

The group filed another lawsuit in 2016 alleging the DNR must consider the impact a high-capacity well will have on surrounding groundwater levels before granting permits for such wells. Both cases are now before the state Supreme Court.

The DOJ under Republican Attorney General Brad Schimel had sided with the DNR in both cases. Kaul defeated Schimel in November's elections. He filed briefs Thursday with the Supreme Court saying the agency is now aligned with Clean Wisconsin.

The Trump administration has enlisted several outside consultants to examine the costs of the Education Department’s $1.5 trillion student loan portfolio and has considered options for selling off some of the debt to private investors, according to federal procurement records and department officials.

The Education Department last month hired FI Consulting, an economic consulting firm, to conduct an analysis of the “economic value” of the federal government’s student loan portfolio, according to procurement records.

Selling off parts of the federal student loan portfolio would be at least unusual, if not unprecedented. And it would also face a number of legal and political complications.

The Education Department has for decades had the authority under the Higher Education Act to sell federal student loans after consulting with the Treasury Department and only if the transaction would not cost taxpayers money. Most federal student loan programs operate at a profit to the government, so their sale would likely be booked as a cost to taxpayers, at least under the current accounting rules.

Administration officials were preparing to advise President Donald Trump “with regard to the potential economic impact of impairment to the collectability of outstanding balances” in the federal government’s student loan portfolio, according to the procurement document. Department officials also wrote that the consulting firm was being hired on an “urgent” basis.

McKinsey & Company has also been hired by the Education Department to analyze the student loan portfolio and make recommendations on how to manage it, officials said. McKinsey for the past two years has also been advising the department on its major overhaul of student loan servicing and other issues.

The Wall Street Journal first reported the news of the McKinsey study on Wednesday. The Journal also reported, citing administration officials, that a potential sale of federal student loans is under consideration by the White House.

Several Education Department officials who were not authorized to speak publicly also told POLITICO this week that the Trump administration had internally discussed and considered selling off parts of the federal student loan portfolio.

The analysis of the student loan portfolio — and discussion of potential sale options — has been led, in part, by A. Wayne Johnson, the chief strategy and transformation officer, according to department officials. The project has also involved Jeff Courtney, a former J.P.Morgan executive whom DeVos hired last year as a consultant for the Office of Federal Student Aid.

Johnson said in 2017 when he was head of the Office of Federal Student Aid that that selling off parts of the federal government’s student loan portfolio was something on the table for discussion. A student loan industry group floated such a proposal shortly after Trump’s election in 2016.

Education Department spokesperson Liz Hill said in an email earlier this week that “selling off the portfolio isn’t what we’re doing.” She added: “There might be some folks who are misinformed or misinterpreting our actions.”

The hiring of consultants to evaluate the costs of the federal student loan portfolio “has nothing to do with selling off the loan portfolio,” Hill said. “It’s about getting a clear understanding of the state of the portfolio, which is the responsible thing to do since we’re charged with overseeing it and it has ballooned to nearly $1.5 trillion.”

DeVos “takes very seriously the fact that the portfolio is $1.5 trillion and growing and she has pulled in outside resources to take a deeper dive into the numbers,” Hill said. She did not respond to requests for further information on Wednesday.

DeVos has previously raised concerns about the amount of outstanding federal student loan debt, describing it as part of a “crisis” in higher education in a speech last fall at her agency’s annual student financial aid conference.

“Only through government accounting is this student loan portfolio counted as anything but an asset embedded with significant risk,” DeVos said. “In the commercial world, no bank regulator would allow this portfolio to be valued at full, face value.”

It’s not clear how the consulting firms will pursue their analysis of the federal student loan portfolio or what data they will be provided.

The Education Department already estimates and calculates the cost to taxpayers of federal student loans on a regular basis according to the accounting rules that are set by Congress. Critics of those accounting standards say they do not properly take into account the full risk to taxpayers of the student loans.

The Congressional Budget Office estimated last year that new student loans disbursed in 2019 would save taxpayers $4.1 billion over the life of the debt. Under fair-value accounting methodology, the CBO said that the same loans are projected to cost taxpayers $16.1 billion."
"Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein resigns, effective May 11",https://www.marketwatch.com,['Sadie Gurman'],04-29-2019,2019,4,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/deputy-attorney-general-rod-rosenstein-resigns-effective-may-11-2019-04-29,"Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein submitted his resignation letter to President Trump on Monday, ending a tumultuous two years in which he tried to steady a rocky Justice Department and its relationship with the White House.

His resignation is effective May 11.

“I am grateful to you for the opportunity to serve; for the courtesy and humor you often display in our personal conversations; and for the goals you set in your inaugural address: patriotism, unity, safety, education and prosperity,” Rosenstein wrote in the letter, which was reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.

Rosenstein’s successor, Jeffrey Rosen, currently the No. 2 official at the Transportation Department, is awaiting a likely confirmation by the Senate. Rosenstein made no mention of the special counsel in his resignation letter. He instead wrote of the Justice Department’s responsibility to avoid partisanship.

On the first anniversary of taking office, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo addresses unveils a new departmental ""ethos"" in the lobby of the State Department in April 2019. (Jim Lo Scalzo/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock)

Daniel W. Drezner is a professor of international politics at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University and a regular contributor to PostEverything

Once upon a time, the director of policy planning for the State Department was a pretty prestigious job. George Kennan, he of the “Long Telegram” and “Sources of Soviet Conduct” fame, was the first director. Some of the others — Paul Nitze, Bob Bowie, Walt Rostow, Dennis A. Ross, James Steinberg, Richard Haass, Anne-Marie Slaughter — have been among the more distinguished foreign policy thinkers in this country. A strong director of policy planning can serve as a vital adjunct to the secretary of state and act as a reminder about the nation’s strategic interests. A good policy planning director is adept at avoiding trivia, distinguishing the important from the urgent, and acting as a check against an administration’s worst impulses.

Brian Hook, the director of policy planning under Rex Tillerson, was granted a tremendous amount of authority but stumbled badly. He was a relative neophyte attempting to counsel a complete neophyte on the ins and outs of the job. He did ... poorly.

When Mike Pompeo came on, he hired Kiron Skinner to run policy planning. In contrast to Hook, she has thought about this stuff for a while. She has the academic credentials and publishing record one would expect for that job. She is also an African American woman, a rarity in the upper echelons of the Trump administration (particularly in the diplomatic corps).

Since coming on in September of last year, however, Skinner has made some odd statements. She penned a Wall Street Journal op-ed last December that made it clear she had written Mike Pompeo’s badly received Brussels speech that caricatured multilateralism beyond all recognition. In the op-ed, she claimed that “the Trump administration is acting to preserve a just, transparent, and free world of sovereign states,” which sounds way too close to Vladimir Putin’s notion of “sovereign democracy” for my comfort.

On Monday, she sat down with Slaughter to chat about the Trump administration’s grand strategy at the New America Foundation. The New Yorker’s Masha Gessen attended and found it unnerving:

A large part of Skinner’s job is listening to what the President says and trying to make sense of it. She said as much. “The president provides the hunches and instincts,” she said, “and it’s my job, and that of Secretary Pompeo, to turn those hunches and instincts into hypotheses.” She called the hypotheses the “Trump Doctrine” and the “Pompeo Corollary.” Slaughter, logically, asked what the Trump Doctrine was. “That’s a tough one,” Skinner responded, without a hint of irony. “It is, in a kind of broad way, a set of pillars that address 21st-century realities.” The pillars were: the “return to national sovereignty”; national interest; reciprocity in international relations and trade; “burden sharing,” particularly in defense; and “new regional partnerships” for what she described as “particular crises.”

Skinner’s comments unnerved Gessen for the same reason that her WSJ op-ed unnerved me: “I had heard the isolationism and destruction of Putin’s rule be framed in phrases such as ‘sovereign democracy’ and in a lot of other plausible-sounding policy gobbledygook that served to rob every word of familiar meaning.”

To be fair, however, Skinner did say some things that were a lot of things, but decidedly not gobbledygook. The Washington Examiner’s Joel Gehrke reported on that element of Skinner’s comments, in which she was described as leading an effort to develop a concept of U.S.-China relations akin to what Kennan did for the Soviet Union:

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s team is developing a strategy for China based on the idea of “a fight with a really different civilization” for the first time in American history.... “The Soviet Union and that competition, in a way it was a fight within the Western family,” Skinner said, noting Karl Marx’s indebtedness to Western political ideas. “It’s the first time that we will have a great power competitor that is not Caucasian.”.... Skinner suggested that human rights arguments might not be as useful against China as they were against the Soviet Union, which was weakened by a 1975 agreement that allowed Soviet dissidents to cooperate indirectly with Western powers to advocate for “the rights of emigration and religious freedom,” according to the State Department. “It was a really important Western concept that opened the door really to undermine the Soviet Union, a totalitarian state, on human rights principles,” she said. “That’s not really possible with China.”

So there’s a lot going on in just those few paragraphs. Because I was just handed a whole bunch of final papers to grade, I have grading on the brain right now. Here’s how I would grade Skinner if she had made an oral presentation like this one for my Art and Science of Statecraft class:

Kiron,

You observe, correctly, that Donald Trump has forced the foreign policy community to revisit “first principles.” And what you said to Slaughter was certainly consistent with the key components of the Trump’s administration’s National Security Strategy, which prioritizes great power competition as the priority for the United States going forward. Furthermore, although controversial, your implicit use of Huntington’s “clash of civilizations” frame does get at one aspect of the Chinese challenge: to Beijing, this is not about a rise to great power status, it is a return to that status, consistent with its civilizational history.

That said, there are some real flaws with your oral defense. For one thing, your claim that China represents the first non-Caucasian great power competitor to the United States is factually incorrect, unless the Germans really did bomb Pearl Harbor. For another thing, why in the name of all that is holy would you make a racial distinction with respect to the great powers?! If you want to say that China is Confucian, or based on a different set of civilizational principles than the United States, sure, give it a try. Why say “not Caucasian”?! Does this mean India or Japan or South Korea should also be approached differently, because they are not white civilizations?! Why use race as your unit of analysis?

Furthermore, if you are going to use a Huntingtonian frame, you should know that he treated Russia as “Orthodox” and therefore distinct from Western civilization. Sure, the Soviet Union incorporated the very Western thought of Karl Marx, but last I checked — hold on a sec — yep, I just checked again and it turns out that China’s ruling party is also totally into Marx! Why is China so different?

Finally, I am very unclear as to why China’s civilization renders it less vulnerable to human rights treaties than the Soviet Union. If you recall, conservatives really disliked the Helsinki Final Act when it was actually negotiated, and it caught many of them by surprise that it helped inspire the Charter 77 movement and other acts of dissidence. It is not like China has no history of dissident appeals to Western liberal values (see here and here). Furthermore, you should be familiar with works by Iain Johnston, or Stacie Goddard, or Rosemary Foot and Andrew Walter, that discuss how China’s participation in Western institutions has had an impact on its self-perception.

There are perfectly valid reasons for the Trump administration to prioritize China as a strategic threat. This is one of the few Trump statements that generates bipartisan support. If you are trying to articulate a “Sources of Chinese Conduct” essay, however, it would be a very good idea to get beyond the fact that China is not a country filled with Caucasians. In fact, maybe just disregard the race angle altogether. It inflames far more than it illuminates.

Kennan could write “Sources of Soviet Conduct” because he was a longstanding expert on Soviet politics. Your comments on China suggest you could use a few old Asia hands to help with some tutoring. You clearly have a lot more work to do to persuade me that American grand strategy isn’t doomed.

DOJ finalizes argument for gutting Obamacare,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-01-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/healthcare/doj-finalizes-argument-for-gutting-obamacare,"The Department of Justice on Wednesday spelled out its arguments siding with a federal judge who ruled last year that Obamacare was unconstitutional and needed to be thrown out.

""Instead of rewriting the statute by picking and choosing which provisions to invalidate, the proper course is to strike it down in its entirety,"" officials from the Department of Justice wrote in a brief filed ahead of the deadline Wednesday with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit in New Orleans. The hearing on the case, Texas v. United States, is expected in July.

The appeal comes after a federal judge in December ruled that the healthcare law, formally known as the Affordable Care Act, was unconstitutional. The judge sided with Republican state officials who filed the initial lawsuit and want the law to be thrown out as a result of the Trump-signed tax law that zeroed out Obamacare's fine for the uninsured. They argue that without the provision requiring individuals to have insurance, the rest of the law must fall, and the federal judge, Reed O’Connor, agreed.

Democratic attorneys general appealed the case, and the ruling is being stayed in the meantime.

The Trump administration's latest position is a shift from when the law was argued before O'Connor. The Trump administration previously argued that only the rules involving protections for people with pre-existing illnesses should fall. The protections say that insurers must cover a range of medical services and that they are not allowed to turn away sick people or charge them more than healthy people.

The administration changed its position to side with the GOP officials to have the whole law thrown out, writing in the brief filed Wednesday that ""upon further consideration and review of the district court’s opinion, it is the position of the United States that the balance of the ACA also is inseverable and must be struck down"" and that the fine on the uninsured ""works part and parcel with the other health-insurance reforms in the ACA.""

If all of Obamacare were to be declared unconstitutional, then other provisions in the healthcare law would be undone, including the expansion of the government's Medicaid program to the poor, cuts to drug prices in Medicaid, and a rule that allows children to remain on their parents' health insurance plan until age 26."
Government watchdogs concerned about vacancies at the top of DHS,https://www.cnn.com,['Geneva Sands'],05-01-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/01/politics/watchdogs-concerned-vacancies-dhs/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Current vacancies at the highest levels of the Department of Homeland Security are cause for concern at a department already struggling with management and morale problems, current and former government watchdogs testified on Wednesday.

""In the best of times, DHS is unruly and difficult to manage organization and we are not in the best of times,"" said former Inspector General John Roth during a House Homeland Security Committee hearing. Vacancies, ""particularly those that remain vacant for a long time, cripple the ability of the Department to move forward,"" wrote Roth in testimony.

A little over three weeks ago, amid the ouster of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, a shakeup in the leadership ranks at DHS left the department with numerous acting officials in top posts and the departure of senior leaders. After the purge in leadership , Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan was tapped to take on the acting secretary role, leaving CBP with an acting leader as well.

""This lack of settled leadership contributes to the significant morale problems that are endemic to DHS components,"" Roth said in his written testimony.

There are currently acting officials serving in eight positions at DHS that require Senate confirmation, according to the Government Accountability Office.

"Plan to move USDA jobs, possibly to Georgia, pits Perdue against ally",https://www.ajc.com,[],,,,https://www.ajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/plan-move-usda-jobs-possibly-georgia-pits-perdue-against-ally/cVzwBZ6sQOhlAvvIg51IZJ/,"Leaders in dozens of states covet the headquarters of the Economic Research Service and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture for their 600-plus high-paying jobs and expected spinoff investments from vendors. Some observers think, because Perdue was governor of Georgia, the two Peach State cities have an inside track against the 66 other locations still in contention.

But standing in the way is U.S. Rep. Sanford Bishop, D-Albany, one of Perdue’s longtime allies who holds a key post in the new Democratic-controlled House.

The political friction threatens to throw a kink into Georgia’s pitch as Perdue angles for a decision this summer.

In his 26 years on Capitol Hill, Bishop has honed a reputation for steering federal dollars to his poor, largely rural southwest Georgia district. But Bishop panned Perdue’s proposal to move the agencies out of Washington, calling it “a bad idea” that would harm morale and potentially hamper the agencies’ objectivity.

And Bishop hasn’t shied from wielding his position as chairman of a powerful House subcommittee to try to block the move using Congress’ power of the purse.

“It does not make any sense and it seems to be a solution in search of a problem,” Bishop told Perdue at a recent budget hearing.

Perdue says shifting the bulk of the agencies’ employees out of Washington will help cut costs and bolster the department’s relationship with farmers. Even though he’s made overtures to Bishop in recent months, Perdue suggested he could circumvent Congress entirely.

“Congressman Bishop … is one of the ones we want to satisfy,” Perdue said during a recent stop at a USDA facility in Newnan. “We’ve been trying to be very patient with his people. If you’ve got questions, please let us address them and we’ll tell you the why, what, when, how that we’ve proceeded in this.”

The spat has created an awkward public rift between two powerful Georgians whose friendship dates to their days as Democrats entering the state Senate together in 1991. It’s also put Bishop at odds with other members of Georgia’s congressional delegation, many of whom support relocating the agencies.

State economic development officials, meanwhile, find themselves in a bind. They view Bishop as a friend in Washington, and they need his support for other issues such as Hurricane Michael relief. But they also desperately want the new headquarters and quietly hope the dust settles.

Bert Brantley, the chief operating officer for the state Department of Economic Development and an aide to Perdue when he was governor, steered clear of the political controversy. Instead, Brantley touted the potential for spinoff jobs and the chance to attract companies wanting to serve the USDA.

He pointed to the U.S. Army Cyber Command, scheduled to relocate from Maryland to Fort Gordon near Augusta next year and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as two federal headquarters — albeit on larger scales — that have become a boon to their communities.

“We are hopeful that all of our delegation and political leaders see the benefit of a project like this coming to Georgia,” Brantley said of the USDA facilities. “We completely understand and respect everyone’s differing perspective.”

‘No hard data’

Bishop holds immense power over Perdue as chairman of the House Appropriations subcommittee that writes spending bills for the Department of Agriculture. The two are chummy and have generally been in sync on major policy issues.

Over the past two years, Perdue has put his stamp on the USDA, taking the first steps to reorganize several chunks of a massive bureaucracy and the 100,000-person department he oversees. Still, his announcement in August about wanting to move the ERS and NIFA — which conduct and fund agricultural research — reportedly caught many of his own staff members off guard.

Cutting costs and moving researchers closer to the field, Perdue said, “will help us fulfill our informal motto to ‘Do right and feed everyone.’ ”

The move infuriated Democrats on the House Appropriations Committee, who said they were blindsided and didn’t receive a cost-benefit analysis from the USDA.

In a swipe at Perdue, Bishop called it “ironic” that the proposed move of two research agencies had “no hard data supporting it.”

A top Perdue adviser testified that analysis will be released closer to when the USDA picks the winning city. The search, which started with 136 expressions of interest from 35 states, was recently narrowed to 68 cities, including Athens and Griffin. Another cut is pending.

Both of Georgia’s candidates rely heavily on the University of Georgia, a land-grant university and agricultural powerhouse. Airport access is a critical need outlined by the USDA, and both sites are within about an hour of Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, depending on traffic.

Brantley, the Georgia economic development official, said Griffin and Athens check all the boxes of the USDA’s criteria, including low costs for operations and living, easier commutes than the D.C. metro area and high quality of life.

For Bishop, “it’s not a question of parochial interest,” he told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

Quality of life

Republican members of Georgia’s delegation largely support the state’s bids.

“We believe relocating ERS and NIFA would build upon USDA’s capacity and improve the agency’s ability to recruit top talent from universities across the nation while being closer to rural America and reducing taxpayer expenditures,” 32 GOP House members, including U.S. Reps. Austin Scott of Tifton and Rick Allen of Evans, wrote in March.

Bishop’s four Georgia Democratic colleagues, meanwhile, are publicly sidestepping the fight.

Scientific groups including the American Statistical Association, the Association of American Veterinary Medical Colleges and the Union of Concerned Scientists, support Bishop. They fear a relocation would undermine the quality of the agencies’ work.

“If it’s such a good idea and (Perdue) has some real reasons, why wouldn’t he share them and build a coalition of people that support it?” said Gale Buchanan, a former USDA official and onetime dean of UGA’s College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences who opposes the relocation. “Getting Congress on board, to me, would be a step in the right direction.”

Bishop tried to block the move earlier this year in a must-pass spending bill, though the provision was eventually watered down.

The USDA hired the consulting firm Ernst & Young to evaluate sites, and Perdue said he’s committed to conducting “a very transparent and professional” search.

Though Perdue said he’s willing to work with Congress, he said he’d take unilateral action if necessary.

“I do believe I have the legal authority to do this (within the powers of) the executive branch,” Perdue said, “but I would love to do it with Congress’ blessings.”

The USDA’s internal watchdog is currently reviewing whether that is indeed the case and if Perdue followed proper relocation procedures.

In a recent hearing, Bishop said Perdue’s plan would hurt morale in agencies already battered by staff departures and proposals for deep budget cuts. Keeping ERS and NIFA staff near other federal research agencies, he said, would help them meet their mission.

John Boyd, a site selection consultant in New Jersey, called government agency relocations “the next frontier of headquarters attraction.”

Modern communications and air travel lessen the need for government to be centrally located, Boyd said.

Many real estate interests want the federal government to move some functions out of the Washington area because office space is so expensive. Amazon recently selected a site in Northern Virginia for its second headquarters, a move that’s only going to make office space and talent even pricier, Boyd said.

The sprawling USDA could be a prime candidate for other relocations. It’s also something that could draw support from Republicans and rural Democrats, Boyd said.

For his part, Bishop said the tiff hasn’t harmed his relationship with Perdue. The two recently appeared together at an event at Fort Valley State University.

“Reasonable minds can disagree,” he said.

As for whether Perdue has the authority to circumvent Congress, the longtime appropriator was more tart.

“Well, maybe he does,” Bishop said, “but he has to have money to spend to do it.”

Most people in this country do not support Donald Trump and never have. As The New York Times recently reported, he “is the only president in the history of Gallup polling never to earn the support of a majority of Americans even for a single day of his term.” This simple fact should be the starting point for all analysis of the 2020 presidential election, but rather than stating it at the outset, most pundits and columnists ignore a crucial reality. In doing so, they distort their coverage and default to Trump. Ad Policy

I almost hesitate to point this fact out because we need to sustain a strong sense of urgency in order to win back the White House, but it is important to allocate time, energy, and resources in the most informed and effective fashion. What we think has to happen in order to win in 2020 will drive our efforts in 2019, so we need to have this discussion now. Mathematically and empirically, as we enter this election cycle, Donald Trump is not favored to win reelection. The president is not the front-runner.

In normal election cycles, incumbent presidents are seen as likely to win reelection by virtue of their name recognition and media attention. Trump has both in droves, but this is no normal election cycle. The country is currently engaged in a titanic struggle that is evocative of the 1860s Civil War era and 1960s civil-rights movement. CNN political analyst Ron Brownstein describes it as a battle between the “coalition of restoration” and the “coalition of transformation.” The essence of the struggle, as Brownstein explains, is whether one embraces or opposes the “relentless economic, demographic and cultural changes reshaping American life.”

Brownstein’s framework is more on point than the pervasive view that the 2020 contest is a boxing match in which victory will belong to the party that selects the most effective pugilist. What will decide the 2020 election is not how many blows one can land on Trump, but how many bodies one can get to the polls to vote him out.

If we fail to learn the right lessons from 2016 (and 2018), we will waste many millions of dollars, squander precious time, and fail to properly reassemble the coalition that twice voted to put a Black man in the White House. An essential fact to keep in mind is that Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by nearly 3 million votes. But her opponent won more electoral votes, so he must be in the stronger position today, right? Wrong.

Three things conspired to make the 2016 election a perfect and catastrophic storm, whereby the election was determined by a mere 78,000 votes in three states: Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania (none of which, notably, gave Trump 50 percent of the popular vote). First, African-American turnout plummeted to its lowest level in nearly 20 years. Second, many Obama voters defected to the third- and fourth-party candidacies of Gary Johnson and Jill Stein. (The vote increase for Stein in Michigan from 2012 to 2016 was greater than the margin of difference between Clinton and Trump). Third, some Obama voters likely did vote for Trump, but not nearly as many as people think. More Obama voters switched to Johnson and Stein than to Trump, and Trump received fewer votes in Wisconsin than Romney did in 2012, troubling the popular perception that a wave of voters switched sides to swell the Republican ranks. Had any one of those three developments gone differently, Clinton would likely be president.

Obviously, since Trump is in the Oval Office, it is possible for him to win again. But is he favored to do so? No. Just as three key factors handed the election to Trump, three significant changes to the country and the electorate since 2016 now give the electoral advantage to the Democrats. First, the country continues to get browner by the hour (hence this administration’s maniacal focus on restricting and reversing immigration trends). Based on the analysis I did of census and government data for my book Brown Is the New White, there are 7,000 more people of color added to the US population every single day—as compared to just 1,000 whites—through a combination of births, deaths, and legal immigration. The Center for American Progress and other think tanks released a report last year showing that, if we had a do-over of the 2016 election, with every demographic group voting in 2020 exactly as they did in 2016, including third-party votes, Trump would lose, simply because there will be that many more people of color in the electorate in 2020. Roughly one-third of all eligible voters will be people of color next year, in what will be the “least white and most diverse electorate ever.” Current Issue View our current issue

The second changed reality on the electoral landscape is the tangible effect of the 2018 elections, which brought a new slate of Democratic leaders and a push to expand the electorate. Whereas the previous Republican governors of Wisconsin and Michigan worked overtime to restrict the franchise and aid and abet voter suppression, those states now have Democrats in their governor’s mansions (and African Americans in the lieutenant governors’ offices). The governmental apparatus can now be brought to bear to remove obstacles to voting instead of erecting them. In states that were decided by 11,000 (Michigan) and 22,000 (Wisconsin) votes, that’s a major development.

The work done to expand the electorate for the 2018 elections also created new battleground states out of formerly comfortable Republican territory. Democrats fielded historically strong gubernatorial candidates in Georgia, Florida, and Arizona last year, with the nominees all winning more votes than any prior Democratic gubernatorial nominee in their state. Although their candidacies fell agonizingly short of prevailing, the states saw major infrastructural changes: Florida restored the right to vote to people with felony records; Georgia was forced to overturn a harsh automated voter-purge system; and Arizona elected a secretary of state who supports automatic voter registration and has pledged to keep a close eye on the rolls. These changes will give Democrats a competitive edge in the three states, all of which are on the front lines of the demographic revolution. Moreover, the gubernatorial candidate standard-bearers in Florida and Georgia (Andrew Gillum and Stacey Abrams, respectively), among the party’s top rising stars, are focused on turning their 2018 supporters into permanent political forces.

The third development is that, finally, some whites who supported Trump have had enough. The 2018 election saw Republican support among white college-educated women drop from a 10-point GOP advantage to a statistical tie between the parties. That shift helped the Democrats take back control of the House. In determining political priorities and investment strategy, it is critical to realize that the data shows that the most movable white Republicans are white college-educated women, who many Democrats seem to have forgotten in their obsession over white working-class male Trump supporters.

To be sure, Democrats and progressives could still mess this up (I’m looking at you, Jill Stein and Howard Schultz). But the mathematical foundation is plain and simple: Trump starts out behind.

More trouble for Mallinckrodt: DOJ joins the fray in Acthar whistleblower suits,https://www.fiercepharma.com,['Kyle Blankenship'],,,,https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/more-trouble-for-mallinckrodt-doj-joins-fray-acthar-whistleblower-suits,"Mallinckrodt is no stranger to legal challenges, having fought through payer lawsuits on its extravagant price hikes and federal subpoenas for its sale of powerful opioids. Facing claims an acquired company paid off doctors for scripts, the drugmaker will now square off against the feds once again.

The U.S. Justice Department joined a pair of whistleblower suits alleging Questcor Pharma, acquired by Mallinckrodt in 2014, paid doctors to boost sales of its controversial H.P. Acthar Gel and retaliated against employees who threatened to blow the company’s cover.

A newly unsealed complaint alleges Questcor ran a “high-tiered strategy” to illegally market Acthar through “deceptive, false and misleading methods” and defrauded government healthcare programs through false claims.

Mallinckrodt said it is negotiating with the feds on a settlement and expects to reach an agreement quickly.

“Mallinckrodt has cooperated fully with the DOJ in its review of this historical conduct, voluntarily providing documents and information to the government,” the company said in an emailed statement. “While we are disappointed the DOJ has elected to proceed with the lawsuit, we have been in advanced settlement talks with the government over the past several months.”

Federal prosecutors' decision to join in adds weight to the whistleblower allegations, which first surfaced in 2012. The lawsuits say Questcor cultivated a culture of impropriety around its Acthar marketing, including using “dirty data” to mislead payers.

Whistleblowers also allege the company retaliated against them after sham internal investigations turned up no wrongdoing.

Rasvinder Dhaliwal, a former associate director of market access for Questcor, said in a separate whistleblower suit—which the government has not joined—that she was fired and intimidated by company officials after bringing her concerns to management.

The renewed scrutiny on Questcor’s marketing strategy is just one of a slew of black marks for Acthar, which was previously targeted for its exorbitant price hikes.

In a payer lawsuit filed in October 2017, Medicare Advantage organizations accused Questcor and Mallinckrodt of sidelining a potential Acthar challenger to avoid competition and hiking the price of the drug to $34,000 from $40 per vial over the course of six years, an 850-fold increase.

The payer suit followed a $100 million settlement with the Federal Trade Commission that investigated claims that Questcor bought out competitor Synacthen Depot to hike Acthar’s price.

The DOJ's complaint against Mallinckrodt is not the company’s first run-in with federal prosecutors.

In February 2018, the company was hit with a subpoena from U.S. prosecutors in Florida requesting information on the company’s sales of its oxymorphone generics. A year earlier, Mallinckrodt settled with the DOJ for $35 million after massive diversions of the company’s opioids were reported on the streets of Florida"

The evolution of the obstruction of justice dispute between Barr and Mueller,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Philip Bump', 'National Correspondent Focused Largely On The Numbers Behind Politics']",05-01-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/05/01/evolution-obstruction-justice-dispute-between-barr-mueller/,"

Attorney General William Barr answers a question during a news conference hours before releasing a lightly redacted version of the Mueller report on April 18 in Washington. (Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post)

There’s been little question since the news conference that preceded the release of the report detailing special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s investigation that Attorney General William P. Barr believed that he should contextualize Mueller’s work in a way that’s relatively favorable to President Trump. What only became obvious this week was the extent to which Mueller took issue with Barr’s framing.

Tuesday evening we learned that Mueller wrote Barr a letter shortly after Barr released a four-page memo summarizing key conclusions of the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Mueller’s letter took issue with Barr’s presentation of the special counsel’s work, asserting that the memo “did not fully capture the context, nature, and substance” of the investigation.

This is a dispute of significance, particularly given Barr’s public representations about the probe. Below, the broader context of the formation and conclusion of the special counsel probe and how that overlapped with Barr’s arrival at the Department of Justice.

May 17, 2017: Mueller is appointed as special counsel.

With then-Attorney General Jeffrey B. Sessions having recused himself from oversight of Russia-related investigations, it fell to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to decide how to respond after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey in May 2017. Rosenstein appointed Mueller to oversee the Russia probe, giving him and it some measure of independence from Trump’s oversight.

The mandate was simple: Investigate Russian interference in 2016 and any coordination with elements of Trump’s campaign, as well as other matters that might arise as part of that investigation. That would eventually include possible obstruction of justice by the president.

June 8, 2018: Barr sends a memo to the Trump administration.

Barr, who served as attorney general under President George H.W. Bush, sent an unsolicited memo to Rosenstein and Assistant Attorney General Steve Engel in June 2018, as Mueller’s team was pushing forward on its investigation.

The focus of the memo was the idea that Mueller’s probe included an assessment of whether Trump had tried to obstruct the investigation. While admitting that he was “in the dark about many facts,” given the secrecy surrounding Mueller’s work, Barr’s view was broadly that such an investigation was suspect and that “Mueller’s obstruction theory is fatally misconceived.”

An obstruction investigation only became viable “after the alleged collusion by the president or his campaign is established first,” the memo argued. At another point he wrote that “if a DOJ investigation is going to take down a democratically-elected president, it is imperative to the health of our system and to our national cohesion that any claim of wrongdoing is solidly based on evidence of a real crime — not a debatable one.”

Legal experts, reviewing the memo after it was made public, were skeptical.

Nov. 7, 2018: Sessions is fired.

The day after the 2018 midterm elections, Trump booted Sessions and appointed Matt Whitaker to serve as acting attorney general.

Dec. 7, 2018: Barr is nominated to serve as attorney general.

Whitaker wasn’t there long. In early December, Trump tapped Barr for the job.

Jan. 15 and 16, 2019: Barr’s confirmation hearings.

During Barr’s Senate confirmation hearings, the June memo came up. In his opening remarks, he described it as “narrow,” focused only on one specific theory he thought Mueller might be considering, based on news reports. He clarified that it wasn’t the case that he thought a president could never obstruct justice. At one point, he told Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) that his arguments about obstruction were “speculative.”

He also tried to walk back a comment he’d made in 2017 about an investigation into Hillary Clinton being more warranted than Mueller’s probe.

Feb 14: Barr is confirmed.

Barr was approved as Trump’s second attorney general by a 54-45 vote in the Senate.

March 22: Mueller’s team completes its work.

About a month later, Mueller’s team completed its work. In accordance with the regulations governing a special counsel, Barr informed Congress in a letter that Mueller’s team was done and clarified that at no point had the Department of Justice told Mueller that he couldn’t move forward with any prosecutions.

March 24: Barr releases a summary of the report.

Two days later, on a Sunday, Barr released a four-page overview of what Mueller’s team determined. It only quoted Mueller selectively and in brief. It focused on two central questions: Did anyone on Trump’s team illegally coordinate with the Russian government’s two-pronged attempt to interfere in the election and did Trump try to obstruct the investigation itself?

The answer to the first question was no, according to Barr, who cited part of a sentence from Mueller’s report: “[T]he investigation did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.”

On the question of obstruction, Barr quoted Mueller writing that the investigation didn’t exonerate the president. But Barr quickly noted that his own analysis, conducted in concert with Rosenstein, determined that Trump hadn’t violated any laws.

“In making this determination,” he wrote, “we noted that the special counsel recognized that ‘the evidence does not establish that the president was involved in an underlying crime related to Russian election interference,’ and that, while not determinative, the absence of such evidence bears upon the president’s intent with respect to obstruction.” In other words, in the phrasing of his June memo, he didn’t believe that the “claim of wrongdoing [was] solidly based on evidence of a real crime.”

“In cataloguing the president’s actions, many of which took place in public view,” the letter reads, “the report identifies no actions that, in our judgment, constitute obstructive conduct, had a nexus to a pending or contemplated proceeding, and were done with corrupt intent” — all of which would be needed to prove obstruction beyond a reasonable doubt.

It took Trump very little time to lift up Barr’s assessment.

“There was no collusion with Russia,” he said. “There was no obstruction, and — none whatsoever. And it was a complete and total exoneration.”

March 27: Mueller writes a letter to Barr.

Several days later, Mueller wrote the private letter to Barr contesting his presentation of the probe’s conclusions.

“The summary letter the Department sent to Congress and released to the public late in the afternoon of March 24 did not fully capture the context, nature, and substance of this office’s work and conclusions,” it read. “There is now public confusion about critical aspects of the results of our investigation. This threatens to undermine a central purpose for which the Department appointed the Special Counsel: to assure full public confidence in the outcome of the investigations.”

Mueller pressed Barr to release the two-volume report’s executive summaries, which Barr declined to do.

The two spoke by phone the next day. Asked by Barr if he thought the four-page letter was inaccurate, Mueller reportedly said that it wasn’t, but that coverage of the letter was leading to incorrect assumptions about the investigation. (That description might have applied equally well to Donald Trump Jr.'s initial explanation of the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting covered in the Mueller report.) The special counsel’s main worry, The Post reported Tuesday, was that the public’s understanding of the obstruction investigation was incorrect.

Barr also reportedly objected to Mueller’s characterizing the four-page document as a summary.

March 29: Barr releases a follow-up letter to Congress.

He repeated that point in a letter sent to Congress the next day. That letter noted that his four-page document “was not, and did not purport to be, an exhaustive recounting” of what Mueller found.

”[M]y notification to Congress and the public provided, pending release of the report, a summary of its ‘principal conclusions’ — that is, its bottom line,” he continued. He later added, “I do not believe it would be in the public’s interest for me to attempt to summarize the report or release it in serial fashion.”

At the time this letter was released, the dispute with Mueller stemming from the March 27 letter was not publicly known.

April 4: Reports emerge about Mueller team frustration.

A few days later, frustration among members of Mueller’s team — now largely back to their former jobs — emerged in news reports.

The evidence of obstruction, one person who spoke with The Post indicated, “was much more acute than Barr suggested.”

“There was immediate displeasure from the team when they saw how the attorney general had characterized their work instead” of the report’s own summaries, another official said.

April 9-10: Barr appears on Capitol Hill.

The next week, Barr testified before the House and the Senate as part of his regular duties as the head of the Justice Department. Unsurprisingly, the subject of the Mueller probe came up.

On April 9, he was asked about the April 4 news reports by Rep. Charlie Crist (D-Fla.).

“Reports have emerged recently, general, that members of the special counsel’s team are frustrated at some level with the limited information included in your March 24 letter, that it does not adequately or accurately necessarily portray the report’s findings,” Crist said. “Do you know what they’re referencing with that?”

“No, I don’t,” Barr replied. “I think — I think — I suspect that they probably wanted more put out, but in my view, I was not interested in putting out summaries or trying to summarize because I think any summary regardless of who prepares it not only runs the risk of, you know, being underinclusive or overinclusive, but also, you know, would trigger a lot of discussion and analysis that really should await everything coming out at once.”

The next day, Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) asked about the same tension.

“Did Bob Mueller support your conclusion” about obstruction? Van Hollen asked

“I don’t know whether Bob Mueller supported my conclusion,” Barr replied.

Van Hollen returned to the June 2018 memo.

“Did you see any evidence in this report about whether or not President Trump committed what you call a classic sense of obstruction of justice?” he asked.

“I’m not going to characterize or discuss the contents of the report,” Barr replied. “The report will be made public, hopefully next week, and I will come up and testify at that point about it.”

Those answers were not the most interesting news to emerge from Barr’s testimony. The media instead focused on his claim that the Trump campaign had been “spied on,” something that Trump’s reelection team quickly seized on for fundraising.

April 11: Rosenstein defends Barr.

Speaking to the Wall Street Journal, Rosenstein said that Barr was “being as forthcoming as he can, and so this notion that he’s trying to mislead people, I think is just completely bizarre.”

April 15: Details of Barr’s 1989 summary emerge.

Shortly before the report was released, New York University professor of law Ryan Goodman revealed new details about a 1989 incident in which Barr claimed to be presenting the “principal conclusions” of a legal document but which later turned out to be significantly incomplete.

April 18: The report is released.

The plan for the release of the report ensured that Barr’s assessment of what it contained would be released before the public could see even the first page. Barr held a news conference that morning in which he outlined what the full report contained.

At three separate points, he echoed Trump’s constant refrain that there was “no collusion” — though he constrained the lack of collusion to Russia’s social-media and hacking efforts. The report itself, though, released a few hours later, specifically avoided using “collusion” as the benchmark against which the campaign’s actions were judged, instead looking at criminal culpability.

Barr offered a long rationale for Trump’s innocence on claims of obstruction, including muddying the water on intent by noting Trump’s frustration about an investigation that, he said, ultimately showed that there was no collusion.

At several other points in Barr’s remarks and the questions he answered afterward, he misrepresented or buried conclusions from Mueller’s report itself. What Barr said was a lack of a conspiracy, Mueller presented as lacking sufficient evidence. What Barr said was a decision on obstruction that was made outside the context of Justice Department rules barring the indictment of a president, Mueller pointed to specifically in explaining why his team didn’t make determinations about whether Trump broke the law. What Barr presented as full cooperation by the White House ignored that Trump only offered written responses to questions from Mueller’s team — and often woefully incomplete responses at that.

Mueller’s report is specific in noting that he was often stymied in his efforts to find the answers to questions. In Barr’s presentations of Mueller’s findings, the results lack those caveats. What’s more, Mueller’s report specifically indicated that it simply sought to catalogue the evidence for obstruction, at times hinting that Congress should be the arbiters of wrongdoing by Trump on that point.

Barr, of course, made the public decision that Trump hadn’t violated the law back in his four-page letter. He said he didn’t believe Mueller had actually meant to leave the issue to Congress, since “we don’t convene grand juries and conduct criminal investigations for that purpose.”

April 20: The Post reports on the core dispute.

Two days after the report was released, The Post detailed the extent of the dispute between Mueller’s team and Barr’s over obstruction. Barr and Rosenstein had learned only in March that Mueller didn’t intend to weigh in on the question of obstruction, a decision that reportedly surprised them. That was particularly the case given Mueller’s willingness to specifically evaluate the question of coordination with Russia’s interference efforts.

April 29: Rosenstein submits his resignation.

Earlier this week, Rosenstein announced his intent to leave the Justice Department on May 11, a resignation that had been expected for some time. He didn’t mention the Mueller probe in his resignation letter.

May 1: Barr appears before Congress.

In remarks prepared for his testimony on Capitol Hill, Barr addressed his decision-making on the question of obstruction.

“After carefully reviewing the facts and legal theories outlined in the report, and in consultation with the Office of Legal Counsel and other Department lawyers, the Deputy Attorney General and I concluded that, under the principles of federal prosecution, the evidence developed by the Special Counsel would not be sufficient to charge the President with an obstruction-of-justice offense,” the remarks read.

They made that determination because “the prosecutorial judgment whether a crime has been established is an integral part of the Department’s criminal process,” Barr’s comments read — an apparent reference to the dispute raised in The Post’s April 20 report. Given the push for making the report public, “it would not have been appropriate for me simply to release Volume II of the report” — the volume dealing with the obstruction question — “without making a prosecutorial judgment.”

So he and Rosenstein made that judgment: Trump hadn’t violated the law."
Grijalva demands DHS explain release of migrant families into Yuma instead of Phoenix,https://www.azcentral.com,"['Daniel González', 'Published P.M. Mt May']",05-01-2019,2019,5,https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/immigration/2019/05/01/grijalva-why-dhs-releasing-migrant-families-yuma-not-phoenix/3647231002/,"Arizona U.S. Rep. Raul Grijalva (Photo: Rick Scuteri/AP)

Rep. Raul Grijalva is asking the Department of Homeland Security to explain why the Border Patrol is releasing large numbers of migrant families in Yuma, overwhelming the city's one shelter, even though much larger Phoenix has more shelters and plenty of bed space.

In a letter to acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan, Grijlava, an Arizona Democrat whose district includes Yuma, said he traveled to the border city last week, where humanitarian groups told him more migrant families are being released in Yuma and fewer in Phoenix.

""In the past, your agency was releasing a higher number of families in Phoenix, but it appears that there was a change in your agency's internal policy and practices,"" Grijalva wrote.

Grijalva said in the letter that DHS needs to coordinate with humanitarian groups providing assistance to migrants released by the Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

""Additionally, I would like more details about why your agency is now releasing more families n Yuma, Arizona, where capacity is severely limited instead of a more centrally located city like Phoenix with more available resources,"" Grijalva wrote. ""With increasingly high numbers of asylum-seeking families arriving at our southern border, I expect an expedient reply to this letter.""

The Arizona Republic published an article about community groups questioning why in late March the Border Patrol decided to suddenly start releasing large numbers of migrant families on their own recognizance in Yuma, rather than continuing to transfer them to ICE custody for release in Phoenix.

In recent months, community groups have developed a network of nearly 30 churches to temporarily house migrant families released by ICE until arrangements can be made for them to travel by air or bus to unite with relatives or sponsors in other states. They are required to report to immigration authorities or immigration courts in those states.

Some community groups have questioned whether the Trump administration is intentionally creating chaos in border communities by haphazardly releasing large groups of migrant families in an effort to justify calls for Congress to end ""loopholes"" that require the government to release migrant families seeking asylum rather than detain them for long periods.

Yuma's mayor, Doug Nicholls, declared a state of emergency in April, after the city's one migrant shelter, run by the Salvation Army, exceeded its 200-person capacity.

Labor Department says gig workers aren't employees,https://www.cbsnews.com,['Irina Ivanova'],,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/labor-department-says-gig-workers-arent-employees/,"The U.S. Department of Labor sees those who labor for companies like Uber and Lyft as contractors rather than employees.

That decision will help the many such virtual marketplaces that have been sued for wrongful classification of workers.

A key reason the DOL cited for its decision is that these platforms give workers a great deal of control.

The Trump administration is no fan of big tech companies. But a recent decision from its Department of Labor could give a long-term boost to tech giants like Uber, Lyft and the soon-to-go-public Postmates.

These companies -- and many like them -- rely on a wide pool of on-demand workers who sign up through the companies' platforms to drive cars, make deliveries, run errands, walk dogs or clean houses. Many people doing this work disagree with the companies' assertion that they're not employees, but rather solo small-business proprietors using the platform of choice to perform their cleaning (or driving, or delivery) business.

Now the Department of Labor has weighed in, with an opinion letter stating that an on-demand company that appears to provide a cleaning service is correct to classify its workers as independent contractors rather than employees. The decision adds more heft to behemoths like Uber and Lyft and house-cleaning company Handy, all of which face lawsuits accusing them of wrongly classifying workers as independent contractors.

""For that particular company, the letter is sort of a get-out-of-jail-free card,"" said Maya Pinto, a senior researcher at the National Employment Law Project. ""It will be used by this one company and could prod other companies to get similar letters. We believe in most cases, if not all cases, the workers are under control of the company and are in fact employees,"" she said.

In the ""gig economy,"" more injuries for construction workers and truck drivers

Handy, which wasn't named in the letter, is ""a virtual marketplace company that ""operates in the so-called 'on-demand' or 'sharing' economy,'"" the DOL wrote. The marketplace requires workers' name, email and Social Security number to sign them up. It connects them with customers who pay on a per-job basis, and it provides training materials that workers can choose to review or not. The app does allow customers to rate workers and removes workers after they haven't been ""active"" for some time.

A key reason the DOL cited for its decision is that the workers on Handy's platform have a great deal of control. The platform itself doesn't require a minimum of cleaning jobs, allows the workers to sign up with competitor apps or to work directly with customers, and it allows workers to sometimes ask for higher pay than the platform sets.

Thousands of lawsuits



That's substantially different from Uber and Lyft drivers, whose rates are determined by the companies' ever-shifting policies and who are liable to get thrown off the platform once their customer rating dips below about 4.3 stars. Lyft, which went public recently, faces six class actions and ""thousands"" of individual actions accusing it of misclassifying employees, it told the Securities and Exchange Commission. Uber faces two such lawsuits, according to securities filings. Handy has been sued five times by workers.

""If workers are misclassified as independent contractors, and [a] court were to find they're employees, the employer could be responsible for back pay, overtime and minimum-wage violations and record-keeping violations. There could be [family and medical leave] implications, tax implications, workers' compensation implications,"" said Susan Harthill, a partner at Morgan Lewis, representing employers. ""Classification is a big concern for all businesses.""

The nature of ""platform"" work can sometimes create a truly gray area on the employee-contractor spectrum. But the cost difference between paying a employee and an independent contractor is so large, companies often choose to err in their favor while the decisions are fought out in court, saving themselves potentially millions of dollars. (A study last year on ride-hail drivers in New York found that if Uber considered its drivers employees, it would be the largest employer in the city.)

Hitting low-wage workers hardest



In exchange for freedom and flexibility, independent contractors give up most benefits that employees get, such as paid sick time, family leave, overtime or minimum-wage laws, and the right to start or join a union. That tradeoff often hits lowest-paid workers the hardest, labor advocates say.

""Where we see misclassification of workers is a lot of low-wage jobs that have a service sector aspect, or in construction, where companies have a lot of workers and they're trying to cut costs,"" said NELP's general counsel, Catherine Ruckelshaus. ""But the gig companies have made this a key part of their profitability."""
Defense Department agrees to send approximately 320 personnel to US southern border,https://www.cnn.com,"['Kate Sullivan', 'Barbara Starr']",04-29-2019,2019,4,https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/29/politics/dod-personnel-us-southern-border/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan on Monday approved a Department of Homeland Security request for additional support at the US southern border, according to a Pentagon spokesman.

""DoD personnel will assist in driving high-capacity (Customs and Border Patrol) vehicles to transport migrants; providing administrative support, including providing heating, meal distribution and monitoring the welfare of individuals in CBP custody; and attorney support to (Immigration and Customs Enforcement),"" Lt.

Davis said approximately ""320 DoD personnel will be required to support the DHS request for assistance through September 30, 2019, at an estimated cost of $7.4M.""

CNN reported last week the DHS had requested 280 additional US troops and other logistical support for operations on the southern border.

The request comes after CBP released data showing there were more apprehensions on the US southern border in March than in any other month in more than a decade.

US Treasury yields rebound after Fed says inflation decline is 'transient',https://www.cnbc.com,"['Thomas Franck Fred Imbert', 'Thomas Franck', 'Fred Imbert']",05-01-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/01/us-bonds-federal-reserve-meeting-in-focus.html,"U.S. government debt yields rebounded on Wednesday after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said that the central bank sees a decline in inflation as merely temporary and not yet a worrisome sign for the economy.

The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note trimmed losses to around the flatline at 2.514%, while the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond dipped to 2.919%. The 2-year Treasury note yield, which moves inversely with price, reversed an initial 6-basis-point drop and was last seen 4 basis points higher at 2.312%.

The central bank held its benchmark rate in a target between 2.25% and 2.5%, matching investor expectations. The Fed, however, did adjust its language about inflation, noting a more anemic rise in prices during the first few months of 2019.

However, in a press conference following the Fed's statement, Powell added that while the Fed did observe the inflation downtick, he and others at the central bank believe that the lethargic price action is just temporary.

""We think our policy stance is appropriate at the moment and we don't see a strong case for moving in either direction,"" Powell told CNBC's Steve Liesman. ""We say in our statement of longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy that the Committee would be concerned if inflation were running persistently above or below 2%.""

""And in this case, as we look at these readings in the first quarter for core, we do see good reasons to think that some were or all of the unexpected decrease may wind up being transient,"" he added.

Inflation, a critical topic for the Fed, threatens the value of government bonds by eroding the purchasing power of their fixed payments and is often cited by the central bank when it raises borrowing costs to try to cool down the economy. The central bank uses rates to try to balance maximum U.S. employment with stable price growth.

Fed officials have historically viewed 2% inflation as a level consistent with that of a healthy economy. Some Fed officials have grown more cautious as so-called core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy categories, as struggled to hold at the central bank's target.

That could leave the Fed without much room to cut rates should it ever want to combat a downturn in the economy with cheaper lending.

Still, the Fed's statement didn't mark a significant change from their prior commentary and provided little evidence for those thinking the central bank could cut its overnight rate later this year, J.P. Morgan Chief U.S. Economist Mike Feroli told CNBC.

Wednesday's statement ""isn't trying to send a message. I think it's trying to convey how they're reading things. Which is: Growth is better, inflation is softer – all of that we knew before,"" Feroli said. ""If you thought they were kind of teeing up for a cut I would have thought you'd change something more than they did. They didn't change anything on inflation expectations."""
