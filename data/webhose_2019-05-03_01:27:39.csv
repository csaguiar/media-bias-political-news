I wouldn't go so far as to say she had to be comatose. The problem is that we don't know the specifics of this woman's condition, only that she had deteriorated according to the social workers. What is disturbing is that the judge states that the man has a right to sex with his wife. If he thinks that right applies even without her consent, he is seriously behind the times.

Simple. And what this judge was thinking saying it was a right for a man ? There is no ""right to sex"" in marriages. Not from any side. If people don't like that well, get a divorce.

Male right to sex in marriage Infinite Chaos: Husbands do not have a fundamental human right to boff their wives whenever they want. Wives have a fundamental human right to decide for themselves when, where, how and why they will have consensual sex with their husbands. So in this regard, the ruling of Judge Hayden is not a good one. However if a woman or a man for some reason cannot continually give her/his consent to have sex with their spouse anymore then what is to be done for Both spouses? The compact of marriage would seem to presume that a continued sexual relationship is part of the covenant and refusal to do so can be used as grounds for divorce and the legal dissolution of the marriage. So is there implied consent in marriage which must be continually revoked if a spouse does not want sex with their partner or is there no consent which must be continually reaffirmed anew between the partners in a marriage? That's the question at the centre of this conundrum in my opinion. Should outside social workers decide this or should we trust the judgement of a husband or wife to decide what's best for their partner and the couple? As long as abuse is not going on then I think the decision should fall to the loving spouse unless the incapacitated person left instructions to the contrary before they became incapacitated. If agents of the state can prove nefarious intent by the controlling spouse or the real possibility of harm to the physical health of the incapacitated person, then perhaps injunctions are warranted but if no ill intent or health concern is present then this become difficult to justify. This is a tough one. Cheers."

Sarah Palin says John McCain funeral snub was ‘gut punch’ – GOPUSA,www.gopusa.com,,04-03-2019,2019,4,http://www.gopusa.com/sarah-palin-says-john-mccain-funeral-snub-was-gut-punch/,"Sarah Palin says John McCain funeral snub was ‘gut punch’ Washington Times Posted On 7:40 am April 3, 2019 12
Former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin said it felt like a “gut punch” not to be invited to the late Sen. John McCain’s funeral last year.
Mrs. Palin, who ran as Mr. McCain’s running mate during the 2008 election, said Monday on “Good Morning Britain” that she felt it was “unnecessary” for her and several other 2008 campaign staffers to be “disinvited” from the late Republican’s funeral in September.
“No, I wasn’t invited to the funeral,” the former Alaska governor told co-host Piers Morgan.
“I was kind of surprised to be publicly disinvited to the funeral. I think that was an unnecessary step,” she said. “They didn’t have to embarrass me and embarrass others. And it wasn’t just me, it was other good people in our campaign back in 2008 who were very, very loyal to Sen. McCain and worked with him and for him for many years, and they weren’t invited to the funeral.
“That was all weird,” she added. “I hope that doesn’t happen to other people. It’s unnecessary. And, you know, it’s kind of a gut punch.”
McCain, who died in August from brain cancer, reportedly planned his own funeral. News broke shortly after the senator’s death that Mrs. Palin and President Trump had not been extended invitations to any of the services.
Months before his death, McCain revealed in his book, “The Restless Wave,” that he regretted choosing Mrs. Palin as his running mate instead of his close friend, former U.S. Sen. Joe Lieberman of Connecticut, Fox News reported.
Ms. Palin said Monday that she and McCain had a “perfectly fine relationship” and that she was shocked by the comments in his book.
“I heard it from the media, I didn’t hear it from him that he was disappointed,” she said.

"SPLC hires new president, CEO after tumult over co-founder’s firing",www.alreporter.com,Chip Brownlee,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.alreporter.com/2019/04/03/splc-hires-new-president-ceo-after-tumult-over-co-founders-firing/,"Subscribe The Southern Poverty Law Center has appointed an interim president and CEO as it plans to conduct a nationwide search for a permanent leader. The SPLC’s board of directors voted unanimously to name Karen Baynes-Dunning as the civil rights legal group’s interim president, according to the board’s chair. Her appointment comes after the departures of the group’s co-founder Morris Dees and its president Richard Cohen. Baynes-Dunning, who has served on the SPLC board since 2017, resigned from the board in order to take the job as a president and CEO. The board said she will begin immediately managing the organization that is best-known for its monitoring of extremist groups. She will serve until a long-term interim or permanent president is named. “As you may know, over the last few weeks we’ve faced a number of internal workplace challenges,” the chair of the SPLC board Bryan Fair. “It has been a difficult time for us, and we know that it has been a difficult time for many of you as well. However, we remain as committed to our work as ever.” Baynes-Dunning, a former juvenile court judge, has dedicated her career to improving the quality of life for disadvantaged children, youth and families, Fair said. Over the past 25 years, she has served in numerous leadership positions in the public and nonprofit sectors to help improve the policies and services that affect the lives of vulnerable children. Advertisement She is currently the president of Baynes-Dunning Consulting LLC of Greenville, South Carolina, and serves as the federal court-appointed monitor overseeing reform efforts at the Georgia Department of Family and Children Services. She was appointed to the juvenile court bench in Fulton County, Georgia, in 1998, serving until 2002. “Her extensive legal and management experience makes her an incredible asset to our team and the perfect person to step into this role,” Fair said. The move comes after tumult at the organization following the public firing of Dees over unspecified conduct. Cohen resigned just a week after Dee’s firing. APR has reported that the firing following concerns over race and gender equity at the organization. “We’re also firm in our commitment to resolving the issues at hand,” Fair said. The group launched an external review of its workplace practices with Tina Tchen. The former chief of staff for Michelle Obama and one of the leading voices behind the TIME’S UP Legal Defense Fund will advise us on workplace culture issues. “Tina’s evaluation will continue, and we’re committed to enacting long-lasting changes following her recommendations,” Fair said. “Our employees deserve a workplace that reflects our highest values, and we will ensure that it happens.” Fair said hiring Baynes-Dunning is a critical step in that process. “She has consistently shown leadership and dedication to the SPLC and brings a personal commitment to staff engagement in all of her work,” Fair said."

Bill to criminalize abortion officially introduced in Legislature,www.alreporter.com,Brandon Moseley,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.alreporter.com/2019/04/03/bill-to-criminalize-abortion-officially-introduced-in-legislature/,"A new bill introduced by State Rep. Terri Collins, R-Decatur, would treat those who seek out an abortion as criminals. “It simply criminalizes abortion,” Collins said of the anti-abortion bill. “I felt like this is the right time,” Collins said explaining her decision to bring this bill now. About 60 percent of Alabamians voted in favor of amendment two during the 2018 election, Collins said. The amendment stated that Alabama is a pro-life state. “This is something that the court got wrong,” Collins said referring to the Roe vs. Wade decision legalizing abortion in 1973. Collins’ bill would make it a Class A felony to perform an abortion. There would be no punishment for the mother that aborts her child. There would be an exception to save the life of the mother, but no exception for a child conceived by rape. The Georgia Legislature passed the Fetal Heartbeat bill that would outlaw abortions after medical science can detect the preborn child’s heart to begin beating. Collins bill goes further than that and would ban when pregnancy is established, at about two weeks. Advertisement Collins said that she understood that this would mean a federal court fight that would have to go all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, and that there could be cost to the state. “It’s worth it for the children,” she said. “I am a believer that our Declaration of Independence says that we have a right to life.” Collins said that she hoped the court recognized the “personhood” of the unborn. For decades, anti-abortion activists have been seeking to have Roe vs. Wade repealed. They all have failed to sway the Supreme Court. Collins cited the changing composition of the court and the growing scientific knowledge about human development as reasons for hope that the court might reverse one of its most well-known precedents. “We know so much more now,” Collins said citing her service with Save a Life, where she first volunteered in the 1980s. State Rep. Rich Wingo, R-Tuscaloosa, said that the U.S. Supreme Court has made two rulings that were absolute “absurdities” — the Dred Scott decision and Roe v. Wade. Wingo said that there are over 3,500 abortions in Tuscaloosa county alone each year. Wingo added, “We are running a parallel bill in the Senate. We have 68 House cosponsors.” Pro-choice activists have vowed to fight the bill. “HB 314 and SB 211 would be a death sentence for women across this state,” said Staci Fox, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Southeast. “They would also criminalize our doctors, forcing them to make an impossible choice: treat their pregnant patients or protect themselves instead.” “In a state that already suffers from a physician shortage, high rates of infant and maternal mortality, cervical cancer mortality, unintended pregnancy, teen births, rural health care crisis, and opioid addiction, our lawmakers should be focused on increasing access to care — not restricting it. Beyond that, these bans are blatantly unconstitutional and lawmakers know it — they just don’t care,” Fox said. “Alabamians are just pawns in this political game to challenge access to safe, legal abortion nationally.”"
"DNC calls out Worley, says she’s wasting money that Alabama Dems don’t have",www.alreporter.com,Josh Moon,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.alreporter.com/2019/04/03/dnc-calls-out-worley-says-shes-wasting-money-that-alabama-dems-dont-have/,"Subscribe The Democratic National Committee has had just about enough of Nancy Worley and Joe Reed. A scathing email sent Monday from Harold Ickes and Yvette Lewis, the co-chairs of the DNC’s credentials committee, lays out a litany of missteps, wasted money, outright lies and what appears to be a long-term scheme perpetrated by Worley and Reed to stack the State Democratic Executive Committee with almost exclusively African American at-large members in order to maintain control of the state party. The email from Ickes and Lewis was sent in response to Alabama Democratic Party chairwoman Worley and Reed, the vice-chair of minority affairs, moving forward at last Friday’s SDEC meeting with the election of a new minority at-large member, despite a clear directive from the DNC to hold off on such selections until the state party’s bylaws could be amended. That DNC directive came in response to a long series of issues, which culminated in a hearing in February in D.C. before the DNC’s credentials committee. Following that hearing, the August elections for the Alabama Democratic Party’s leadership were invalidated. There were many reasons for the invalidation, but chief among them was an issue the DNC found with ADP’s bylaws — they conflicted with the national party’s and lacked an affirmative action and outreach plan for all recognized minority groups. The bylaws dictate that a state party’s executive committee’s makeup must reflect the voting demographics of the state, and a number of very specific groups are listed. If those groups, which in addition to African Americans include Hispanics, Asians, Pacific Islanders, youth, LGBTQ+ and people with disabilities, can’t be accurately represented in the votes, the state party needs to demonstrate a comprehensive outreach program. The DNC already believed that ADP was falling short in its outreach efforts to all groups except black voters, but Monday’s letter indicates that party officials believe that the lack of outreach was intentional and that Worley and Reed have lied to cover up their true intentions. Advertisement During a series of emails and conference calls over the last few weeks, DNC officials have repeatedly asked Worley to send them ADP’s affirmative action plan that meets DNC standards. This is something Worley has repeatedly told the DNC was in the state party’s bylaws, and she has promised repeatedly to provide a copy to the DNC’s credentials committee. But then, last Friday, Worley informed the Ickes and Lewis that the approval of an affirmative action plan and outreach program would be voted on during the March 29th SDEC meeting. “We are very surprised (by the agenda item) because during our conference call you had asserted several times that the State Committee had an affirmative action plan and outreach program, and you promised to send us those specific provisions of the State Committee’s Bylaws that constituted such policy and procedures,” the email from Ickes and Lewis read. “By your statement in your email, it now seems clear that, other than for Blacks, the State Committee does not have such a policy and procedure.” Such a failure to recruit minorities other than African Americans would give extreme power to Reed, who, as vice-chair for minority affairs, is allowed to handpick at-large members in order to meet the minority numbers needed to meet demographic percentages. During the August meeting, at which Worley was re-elected, Reed was able to select 35 at-large delegates, all of them black. Ickes and Lewis said the recent actions of Worley, coupled with the facts of that August election, now “raises serious questions” about not only the elections of Worley and vice-chairman Randy Kelley, but also the “filling of vacancies from legislative districts.” The email takes Worley to task for a variety of missteps mostly related to her definitions of minority outreach and her attempts to make contact with minority groups other than African Americans. For example, the email notes that in 2017, the SDEC passed an amendment that called for five Hispanic people to be on the committee — a number that Ickes and Lewis said should probably be closer to 10, judging by Alabama voting demographics — but in over a year, not a single Hispanic candidate had been presented for nomination prior to Friday’s meeting. At that meeting, the Hispanic wife of an executive board member was approved. “That the Executive Board could only find one (1) Hispanic woman in the whole state of Alabama to elect at yesterday’s Executive Board meeting graphically underscores the lack of effective, broad affirmative action outreach,” the email read. “And since no mention was made at yesterday’s meeting of affirmative action outreach to youth, LGBTQ + individuals, or individuals with disabilities, we assume that none was conducted.” As for Worley’s decision to move forward with the nomination of that lone Hispanic candidate, despite explicit instructions from the DNC not to do so, Ickes and Lewis didn’t mince words. “The deliberate flouting by the Executive Board, at your urging, of the instructions of the DNC likely will result in another challenge and more legal fees incurred by the ADP,” they wrote. “Such easily avoidable actions are inexplicable and completely contrary to the best interests of Democrats in Alabama and of the ADP.” Moving forward, the DNC is asking Worley to provide it with her clear plans for outreach for all minority groups, and also asking that she explain the calculations she’s used to arrive at the appropriate percentages of each minority group. “The DNC has ordered the ADP to do nothing more than what every other state party undertakes to ensure compliance with the basic requirements of National Party’s long standing Charter and Bylaws,” Ickes and Lewis wrote. “So far, however, certainly including yesterday’s Executive Board meeting, it does not appear that your leadership group is interested in achieving those ends. We certainly hope that you will change your mind.”"
"Opinion | Albritton, Marsh introduce Indian lottery bill, sell out Alabama citizens",www.alreporter.com,Josh Moon,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.alreporter.com/2019/04/03/opinion-albritton-marsh-introduce-indian-lottery-bill-sell-out-alabama-citizens/,"Subscribe Sens. Greg Albritton and Del Marsh are sellouts. There are probably nicer ways I could say that, but what’s the point, really? Why am I worried about the feelings of two guys who are actively working to take food off your table, advantages out of your hands, opportunity away from your kids? Because make no mistake about it, that’s what Albritton and Marsh are trying to do. For their own personal self interests. And no other reason. That is the only reason they would file such a ridiculous, atrocious lottery bill — one that removes roughly two-thirds of the potential revenues by eliminating 90 percent of the ways the lotto games can be played. A bill that would leave the “paper” lottery ticket as the only legal lottery instrument in this state. All to make sure that the sovereign nation that is the Poarch Band of Creek Indians doesn’t lose its tax-free, billion-dollar-per-year monopoly on gambling in Alabama. So, the Indians, without paying a dime in state taxes, can continue to buy up billion-dollar casinos in the Caribbean or in other states, instead of, you know, sending your kids to college or to a state-of-the-art tech program. This is not a complicated situation. Advertisement In years past, with the crazy electronic bingo laws and Indian gaming rules, things did get murky. People were easily misled. But this is easy. Currently, the Poarch Creeks operate three Alabama casinos that feature electronic gambling machines. Those machines make them billions in profits annually. They pay zero in state or local taxes. A lottery proposal by Sen. Jim McClendon would implement a lottery, complete with all of the scratch-offs and electronic games. And it would allow for video lottery terminals, which are basically electronic versions of the scratch-offs. They’re a lot like the electronic machines the Poarch Creeks are operating currently. Those video lottery terminals would be installed at the four dog tracks in Alabama, where gambling is already legal and the local communities have embraced the facilities. The four racetracks would pay more than 20 percent in state and local taxes, generating an estimated $100 million annually and creating more than 13,000 jobs. It is that simple. No matter which way you go, you have essentially the exact same gambling. But if you go with McClendon’s bill, the state gets $100 million annually for scholarship programs and gambling addiction programs and for any number of things that aren’t absolutely nothing. Which is what we get from the Marsh/Albritton plan, which might as well come stamped with the PCI logo at the top of it. Honestly, there is no reason any sane person in the state of Alabama would vote for this. Because absolutely zero people in this state — aside from those in the sovereign nation that is the Poarch Band of Creek Indians — will benefit from this bill in any way. It is a gift to a sovereign nation at the expense of our citizens. It is no different than our legislature offering France an opportunity to open three medical marijuana dispensaries in Alabama with 100 percent of the profits going back to France. It’s mind-boggling that an elected official in this state would attach his name to something that so completely and utterly undermines and harms the people he has sworn an oath to represent in good faith. I mean, they can’t even use the excuse that the Poarch Creeks will be harmed by McClendon’s bill, because they won’t be. The laws governing gaming guarantee that the tribe will be able to operate the exact same games, and they’ll almost certainly pay a fraction of the tax rate to do so. So, why would two Alabama senators put their names to this? I mean, of course, other than the $65,000 in contributions that the Poarch Creeks have dumped into Greg Albritton’s campaign since 2017, despite the fact that he didn’t have an opponent in either the primary or the general. Or the $30,000 that PCI has given to Del Marsh since 2018. That seems like such small amounts to trade for the betterment of the entire state. So, maybe there’s something else there.

House Republicans support bill on medical care for children born alive after attempted abortion,www.alreporter.com,Brandon Moseley,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.alreporter.com/2019/04/03/house-republicans-support-bill-on-medical-care-for-children-born-alive-after-attempted-abortion/,"Subscribe Alabama’s congressional Republicans joined dozens of House Republicans in signing a discharge petition for H.R.962, the Born Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act. The bill would have required health care providers to provide medical care to babies born alive after attempted abortions. If a majority of House members, 218 members, sign the discharge petition, House Democrats will be unable to block a House Floor vote of H.R. 962. Congressman Mo Brooks, R-Huntsville, said, “The pro-abortion Socialist Democrats’ position on abortion has shifted from ‘safe, legal, and rare’ to post-birth. Virginia Governor Ralph Northam recently advocated for infanticide. Describing a scenario where a baby is born alive during an attempted abortion Northam said, ‘The infant would be delivered. The infant would be kept comfortable. The infant would be resuscitated if that’s what the mother and the family desired, and then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother.’ Similarly in New York, Democrats cheered as they passed a bill allowing abortion up until birth.” Congressman Bradley Byrne, R-Montrose, said, “I believe God makes every person in His image, that we all are important and have worth, and that life begins at conception. There should be no question that so-called after-birth abortions are barbaric and wrong.” Congressman Robert Aderholt, R-Haleyville, said, “Babies that survive abortions should be protected and not allowed to die. Democrats need to allow a vote to End Infanticide! The 2002 born-alive law recognized infants born during an abortion as “persons” but did not require abortionists and health care professionals to treat the born-alive infant with the same degree of care given to any other baby.” Congressman Mike Rogers, R-Saks, said, “Life is precious and as a father of three children, this legislation is very important to me. I do not understand how anyone could not support taking care of a living, breathing innocent baby that survives an attempted abortion. Anyone in opposition of this, is supporting infanticide. It’s wrong and it’s disgusting. I will always stand up for the rights of these babies who cannot stand up for themselves.” Advertisement “Legal protection and medical care for infants should not need to be debated,” Congressman Gary Palmer, R-Saks, said. “That’s why I’ve added my support to a discharge petition that would force a vote on the Born Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act. The right to life does not have an age limit or qualification. I’m proud to add my voice to those who are standing up for vulnerable children who cannot speak for themselves.” “When we’re talking about protecting newborns, we’re no longer debating the abortion issue,” Congresswoman Martha Roby, R-Montgomery, said. “America is one of only seven countries worldwide that allows elective abortions after 20 weeks. That puts America in the same category as notorious human rights abusers China and North Korea,” Brooks added. “Pro-abortion Socialist Democrats want America to be even more extreme. Protecting the lives of babies after birth should be a no brainer. Yet, here we are.” “Unfortunately, some of my colleagues believe that even newborn babies do not deserve protecting,” Byrne said. “Though Democrats blocked the bill I cosponsored that would make clear that infanticide is wrong and illegal, I will continue standing up for life.” “Pro-abortion Socialist Democrats have now blocked a vote 25 times on the Born Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, bill to require health care providers to provide lifesaving care to babies born alive,” Brooks concluded. “Unfortunately, Socialist Democrats support infanticide and block all attempts to protect babies who are born alive. Today, I signed the discharge petition for the Born Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act. Only 29 states have laws offering explicit protection for babies who survive abortions. I’m hopeful enough Democrat members will join Republicans in protecting babies born alive so that the House can vote on this important bill.” The discharge petition, filed after Democrats blocked the Born-Alive Survivors Protection Act, failed to garner the 218 signatures to bring the bill before the House of Representatives for a vote. The petition failed to get the needed 21 Democrat votes."

Opinion | State budgets: Priority number one,www.alreporter.com,Steve Flowers,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.alreporter.com/2019/04/03/opinion-state-budgets-priority-number-one/,"Subscribe After their successful special five-day Special Session, the Legislature has been in their Regular Session for a few weeks now. The session will end in June so it is about one-fourth over. Almost one-third of the members are new — freshmen if you will. Even though they are, for the most part, a bright and talented group, they are still wet behind the ears when it comes to legislative ways. Most are still striving to find their way to the bathrooms. Most major issues, especially revenue enhancement measures, are addressed in the first year of a four-year quadrennium. Bless their hearts, right off the bat they were hit with a major vote to increase the gas tax to support an infrastructure plan. That will make the rest of their first year a downhill slide. There are indeed other issues that need addressing in the good old Heart of Dixie. Most Alabamians want the right to vote for a lottery, which they would vote for in a New York minute. Most folks think it is ludicrous that we simply give our money to our sister states. It is not a popular subject, but our prison overcrowding problem has to be addressed. Democratic members are vitally interested in expanding Medicaid to improve and meet the state healthcare needs. Rural hospitals need help. There is also a lot of interest in reforming our criminal justice system. Even though these above mentioned problems and priorities need to be addressed, there is one Constitutional certainty that the two state budgets must be crafted and put to bed. Our state constitution also mandates that they must be balanced. The Education Trust Fund budget is in good shape. Tax revenues that support education grew tremendously last year. Lawmakers will have more money to appropriate for schools. In fact, this will more than likely be the largest education budget in state history. The Education coffers will also be enhanced by the Supreme Court ruling that allows the state to collect online sales taxes. In Alabama state and local sales taxes are the cornerstone of support for basic services. The state’s growth taxes, income and sales, are earmarked for education. This lack of growth in the dollars that support the General Fund has caused headaches for the legislative leaders who write these budgets. However, these budget leaders have done a good job. In this current year’s General Fund budget, they were able to increase funding for state prisons. They also added extra dollars for mental health and law enforcement, as well as the state court system. In addition, the State Budget gave state employees their first cost-of-living raise in decades. Advertisement The $2.04 billion General Fund budget passed easily in the 2018 election year session. It was a different scenario in 2015 and 2016, when lawmakers took multiple special sessions to pass the budgets and reject an array of tax increases and lottery bills to close a large funding gap. A bill passed in 2016 during a Special Session created a salvation for the General Fund – a plan to allocate most of the one-million BP oil spill settlement monies. It allowed legislators to carry over $93 million from the 2018 budget to this year. In actuality, the state legislative leadership has very little discretion in budgeting. The vast majority of our state dollars directed to our state General Fund needs are earmarked. The General Fund Budget accounts for only 13 percent of Alabama’s total spending of $15.6 billion. For example our states gasoline tax is earmarked for roads and bridges and goes into the Road and Bridge Fund, which currently totals $492 million in this year’s budget. Of course that will be increased beginning in September. Most folks are not really cognizant of the fact that most legislators do not really have a lot of input into the state budgets. The chairmen of the Budget Committees of each body, Ways and Means in the House and Finance and Taxation in the Senate, do the work and hold the power. The chairmen of these prestigious and powerful committees are Rep. Bill Poole, R-Tuscaloosa, who chairs the House Education Budget Committee, and Rep. Steve Clouse, R-Ozark, who heads the General Fund. Sen. Greg Albritton, R-Escambia, chairs the Senate General Fund committee and veteran Senator Arthur Orr, R-Decatur, heads the Education Finance Committee As legislators grapple with all of the issues on their plate, one thing remains the same, the State Budgets are priority number one!

In recent years, you’ve probably heard a lot of talk about gluten. Many people are going gluten-free, to help solve everything from fatigue to skin problems to digestive issues, even brain fog.
These people may be considered gluten sensitive.
But there is a smaller group of people for whom eating a gluten-free diet can be a literal lifesaver. For those folks, eating even one crouton could result in serious health complications.
Only about one in 100 people suffer with celiac disease, an autoimmune disease that causes the immune system to attack the small intestine when gluten is consumed.
These people must avoid a host of food products, starting with bread and cereal, but also including salad dressings, ice cream, energy bars, canned beans and ketchup, just to name a few.
Non-food products contain gluten, too, like shampoos, cosmetics and many vitamin supplements. There are at least twenty “code names” for gluten that appear on labels, so avoiding it can be really challenging.
The causes of autoimmune conditions remain unclear. For this reason, science has looked to environmental factors as possible triggers.
In the case of celiac disease, recent research is pointing a finger at a food additive you’ve probably never heard of…
Transglutaminase is an enzyme created in our bodies naturally. Its purpose is to bind proteins together. This is necessary in the formation of blood clots, as well as the formation of skin and hair.
Microbial transglutaminase is a bacterial enzyme that is used in the industrial processing of meat, dairy and baked goods. Its purpose is also to bind proteins together, giving products a better texture and longer shelf life.
Microbial transglutaminase is also known as “meat glue,” since butchers use it to bind different cuts and scraps of meat together.
A recent study indicates that the rise in celiac disease in recent years could be tied to the use of this chemical.
According to Dr. Aaron Lerner, co-author of the study, there’s every indication that microbial transglutaminase could be the real target of the immune system’s attacks in people with celiac disease.
In the last four decades, there is a direct correlation between the use of industrial enzymes like microbial transglutaminase in baking products and the rise in cases of celiac disease.
Not really a surprise, when the FDA has classified “meat glue” products as GRAS, or “Generally Recognized as Safe.”
We know what that means.
The manufacturer has done their own tests (or not), and reported their product to be safe for us to eat, and the FDA has taken them at their word.
There are different forms of “meat glue.” For example, one Japanese company makes several different forms. Some are marketed under the name Activa.
One form of Activa is made specifically for binding not meat, but wheat pasta, and it does contain wheat, usually hidden behind the name “maltodextrin”. But not all people with celiac disease would know that “maltodextrin” equals “wheat.”
With all this unregulated “glue” being put into our foods, how are we to know whether we’re eating something we’d rather not? And how can a person with celiac disease know if they are about to eat something that will harm them?
One part of Dr. Lerner’s study tested antibodies from the blood of celiac disease patients. It appeared that their antibodies were more likely to attack gluten fragments that were attached to transglutaminase than they were to attack gluten alone.
If this is the case, adding “meat glue” to the diet of a celiac patient, or a person whose genetic makeup predisposes them to develop it, is a really bad idea.
“Until there is a clearer answer, we recommend transparency and vigilance with regards to labeling of foods processed using microbial transglutaminase,” says Dr. Lerner.
He cites Switzerland as an example, where these products must be labeled as unsuitable for people with celiac disease.
This, of course, would require more vigilance from the FDA, which does not appear to be forthcoming.
Gluten is hidden everywhere, so avoiding it takes some diligence and planning.
The Celiac Disease Foundation offers a comprehensive guide to foods that are safe to eat.
If you are gluten sensitive, you can follow those guidelines as well, though accidentally ingesting gluten won’t be a serious as it is for someone with celiac. Still, because you want to avoid the miserable symptoms of gluten sensitivity as much as possible, you might find these tips helpful:
• Fruits and vegetables are safe bets, but read the labels of canned, frozen or dried fruits carefully, especially if they are sweetened.
• Avoid processed and ground meats, and opt for fresh meat and seafood. Nuts, legumes and soy products are good protein sources as well.
• Ice cream and most condiments probably contain gluten.
• It can be impossible to avoid gluten. That’s why I rely on Peak Digestion Plus ™ . This entry was posted in Alternative Medicine , Featured . Bookmark the permalink .

Watch Joaquin Phoenix In The First Trailer For ‘Joker’ | The Daily Caller,dailycaller.com,David Hookstead,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://dailycaller.com/2019/04/03/joaquin-phoenix-joker-trailer/,"Watch Joaquin Phoenix In The First Trailer For ‘Joker’ 10:26 AM 04/03/2019 | Entertainment WhatsApp
The first trailer for “Joker” with Joaquin Phoenix was released Wednesday morning.
The plot of the highly anticipated film about the infamous villain’s backstory, according to IMDB , is: “A failed stand-up comedian is driven insane and becomes a psychopathic murderer.”
For fans of the villain or the story in general, the trailer doesn’t disappoint. Phoenix is absolutely chilling as the legendary killer. (RELATED: Check Out Joaquin Phoenix As The Joker In Terrifying Photo From The New Movie)
Watch the preview below:
Dare I say that this film might match Heath Ledger’s performance as the Joker? Dare I say it? Of course, I won’t right now, but that trailer has me hyped.
It looks dark as hell, and that’s the only way to frame the villain, whom Ledger forever made one of the greatest in “The Dark Knight.”
Some might argue that a film about the Joker’s backstory is unnecessary. I completely disagree. I’m down with anything as long as it’s done well.
Given what I saw in that trailer, this should be an outstanding movie. You can catch it in theaters on October 4.
You know that I’ll be checking it out. "

"B-417205,B-417205.2,B-417205.3, MacAulay-Brown, Inc., March 27, 2019",www.gao.gov,,04-02-2019,2019,4,"https://www.gao.gov/products/B-417205,B-417205.2,B-417205.3?source=ra","$54,943,978
AR, Tab 49, Source Selection Decision Document (SSDD), at 5.
The agency assigned several strengths, and no weaknesses, to the proposals of both MacAulay and Deloitte. Id. Under the oral presentation factor, the agency noted that both offerors' presentations indicated an exceptional approach and understanding of the requirements, warranting outstanding ratings. Id. The agency also assigned both proposals outstanding ratings under the technical and management approach factor, finding that both indicated exceptional approaches with low corresponding risk of unsuccessful performance. Id.
The Decision Authority reviewed the Technical Evaluation Team's (TET) evaluation and concluded that Deloitte's proposal represented the best value to the agency. Id. at 6. In this regard, she noted that both offerors were rated outstanding under the non-price factors. Id. After reviewing the strengths assigned to each proposal under the non-cost/price factors, she stated that she ""cannot conclude that either offer lowers risk in a significant manner which sets it apart from the other,"" and found the proposals to be technically equal. Id. She stated that it was therefore not in the best interest of the agency to pay an 82.7 percent price premium for an equally-rated proposal. Id. The agency made award on December 12. COS/MOL at 12. MacAulay's protest followed.
DISCUSSION
MacAulay raises multiple challenges to the evaluation of proposals and selection decision. The firm argues that the agency performed an unreasonable price realism evaluation. In addition, the firm argues that the agency changed its requirements prior to award. Finally, the firm alleges that the Army impermissibly utilized simplified acquisition procedures for this procurement. We note at the outset that, in reviewing protests challenging an agency's evaluation of proposals, our Office does not reevaluate proposals or substitute our judgment for that of the agency; rather, we review the record to determine whether the agency's evaluation was reasonable and consistent with the solicitation's evaluation criteria, as well as applicable statutes and regulations. ManTech Advanced Sys. Int'l, Inc , B-413717, Dec. 16, 2016, 2016 CPD ¶ 370 at 3. For the reasons that follow, we find that we have no basis on which to sustain the protest.
Price Realism
MacAulay argues that agency failed to perform a price realism analysis, as was required by the RFP. Consolidated and Supp. Protest at 20. MacAulay further alleges that, independent of the agency's obligation to evaluate price proposals for realism, the RFP required the agency to assess proposals for significant inconsistencies between proposed price and technical/management approach. Id. at 23. In this regard, MacAulay argues that Deloitte offered to perform the present requirement at a price that is inadequate to cover the cost of sustaining the incumbent work, let alone the expanded work contemplated by the RFP. Id.
The RFP provided that price proposals would be evaluated for reasonableness. AR, Tab 8, § M at 7. The RFP instructed offerors to complete a price matrix by proposing fixed prices for 11 CLINS, which corresponded to the requirements of the solicitation. AR, Tab 7, RFP § L, at 11-12. Offerors were also expected to propose prices for 18 optional CLINS. Id. Additionally, and at issue here, the RFP stated: [A]ny significant inconsistency between proposed Oral Presentation, Technical/Management Approach, and Price submitted, if unexplained in the offer, may be grounds for rejection of the offer due to an Offeror's misunderstanding of the work required or an inability to perform any resultant work under the contract.
Id. at 4.
In response to MacAulay's allegations, the Army contends that this language did not trigger a requirement to perform a price realism analysis. COS/MOL at 13-14. However, the Army asserts that, even if such an evaluation was required, the record shows that it performed a sufficient analysis of Deloitte's price to conclude that it was not unrealistically low. Id. at 15.
We agree required the agency to perform a price realism analysis. As our Office has noted, in the absence of an express price realism provision, we will only conclude that a solicitation contemplates a price realism evaluation where the RFP expressly states that the agency will review prices to determine whether they are so low that they reflect a lack of technical understanding, and where the RFP states that a proposal can be rejected for offering low prices. See Apextech, LLC , B-415153.2, B-415153.3, Mar. 15, 2018, 2018 CPD ¶ 112 at 5. Here, the RFP stated that the agency could reject a proposal if it contained a ""significant inconsistency"" between proposed oral presentation, technical/management approach, and price. AR, Tab 8, § M at 4. Accordingly, we find that this language triggered a requirement for the Army to perform a price realism analysis. See Apextech, LLC, supra , at 5.
While we find that the agency was required to perform a price realism analysis, we do not agree with MacAulay that the agency's price evaluation was unreasonable, or that it otherwise failed to identify any significant inconsistencies between Deloite's proposed price and its technical approach. Where, as here, an RFP contemplates the award of a fixed-price contract, an agency may provide for the use of a price realism analysis for the limited purpose of measuring offerors' understanding of the requirements or to assess the risk inherent in an offeror's proposal. R3 Gov't Solutions LLC , B-404863.2, Sept. 28, 2012, 2012 CPD ¶ 284 at 5. The depth of an agency's price analysis is a matter within the sound exercise of the agency's discretion, and we will not disturb such an analysis unless it lacks a reasonable basis. Lynxnet, LLC , B-409791, B-409791.2, Aug. 4, 2014, 2014 CPD ¶ 233 at 4; Robinson's Lawn Servs., Inc. , B-299551.5, June 30, 2008, 2009 CPD ¶ 45 at 6; Apextech, LLC , supra (finding agency's realism analysis sufficient despite the fact that the record showed that the agency did not use the term ""price realism"" to describe its price analysis).
The Army explains that while it did not explicitly use the term ""price realism"" in evaluating proposals, it did perform an analysis of pricing to determine if Deloitte's price was too low by comparing it to the IGCE. COS/MOL at 15. The agency notes that first the price evaluation team (PET) reviewed price proposals and determined that the two offerors, MacAulay and Deloittee, proposed fair and reasonable prices. AR, Tab 47, PET Price Analysis, at 4. The PET noted that Deloitte's price was roughly 10 percent higher than the IGCE of $49,938,693. Id. Based on this finding, the agency did not find Deloitte's price to be unrealistically low or unreasonably high. COS/MOL at 15.
MacAulay responds that this price analysis was irrational as it was based on a flawed IGCE. Comments on Agency Report at 11. In this regard, MacAulay asserts that the Army irrationally estimated that the ""incumbent work could be sustained with less than [deleted] [percent] of the incumbent level of effort."" Protester Comments on Supp. AR on IGCE at 4 (emphasis omitted). MacAulay contends that sustaining this effort alone could cost $[deleted] to $[deleted] million a year, totaling $[deleted] million to $[deleted] million over the life of the contract, indicating that the Army's IGCE is too low based on the historical burn rates of the incumbent and predecessor contracts, and the Army's concessions that this contract will require some development work. Id. at 6-7 (citing Protest, Exhibit E, Declaration of Director of Client Engagement for MacAulay Subsidiary, at 2).
The agency responds that it performed a robust analysis to develop the IGCE, analyzing a broad cross-section of relevant labor categories and rates from contracts performed on similar types of work. Supp. AR on IGCE, at 3. Additionally, the agency notes that although this procurement includes some limited development work, the procurement does not include the level of development work that MacAulay has completed under the predecessor OTA. Id. at 4.
In a supporting declaration, the Army explains that the IGCE reflects an intended reduction in scope from aspects of the predecessor OTA efforts, including in the areas of innovation and emerging technology, which resulted in fewer estimated labor hours and personnel than the current OTA effort. AR, Tab 61, Declaration of Product Manager for DCO, at 1. Additionally, the IGCE reflects the ""removal and reduction of hosting infrastructure costs, removal of innovation items such as artificial intelligence. . . and a reduction in advanced dashboard development."" Id.
On this record, we have no basis to question the reasonableness of the agency's IGCE, 2 and, by extension, the agency's price evaluation. The agency has provided a reasonable explanation as to why the IGCE reflects a rational estimate of the effort contemplated by the present requirements, and why MacAulay's reliance on historical pricing data is inapplicable given the reduction of development work which it has performed in an OTA environment.
We note also that, by MacAulay's own estimation, a reasonable estimate for ""sustainment alone,"" which the agency has explained represents the requirements contemplated here, would be $[deleted] million, or [deleted] the IGCE amount of $49,938,693. Moreover, we find entirely reasonable the agency's belief that utilizing competitive procedures would further drive prices down. As such, the record does not provide us with a basis to find the agency's IGCE unreasonable. It follows that we have no basis to question the Army's assessment of Deloitte's price, where it was 10 percent higher than the reasonably developed IGCE. See General Dynamics--Ordnance & Tactical Sys. , B-401658, B-401658.2, Oct. 26, 2009, 2009 CPD ¶ 217 at 3 (agencies may use a variety of price evaluation methods to assess realism, including a comparison of prices received to one another, to previously proposed or historically paid prices, or to an independent government estimate). 3
Changed Requirements
MacAulay also argues that the agency made award based on requirements that were materially different from those set forth in the RFP. The protester asserts that the Army knew before award that one of the four infrastructures delineated in the RFP--the Garrison Deployable Platform (GDP)--would be unavailable during performance and that the awardee would have to deploy the solution to an entirely different infrastructure, the Global Enterprise Fabric (GEF). Consolidated and Supp. Protest at 30-31. To support this allegation, MacAulay cites an email provided by agency personnel indicating that ""budget issues"" required the agency to halt its plan to utilize GDP on this requirement, as well as a supporting declaration asserting that the Army notified MacAulay just six days after award that the GDP project was cancelled. Id. (citing Second Declaration of Director of Client Engagement for MacAulay Subsidiary).
Where an agency's requirements materially change after a solicitation has been issued, it must issue an amendment to notify offerors of the changed requirements and afford them an opportunity to respond. See Northop Grumman Sys. Corp. , B-412278.7, B-412278.8, Oct.4, 2017, 2017 CPD ¶ 312 at 14; Murray-Benjamin Elec. Co., L.P. , B-400255, Aug. 7, 2008, 2008 CPD ¶ 155 at 3-4.
The Army responds that MacAulay's assertions reflect a misinterpretation of the Army's communications. COS/MOL at 25. While the Army is constantly reviewing how it could leverage prototypes developed under OTAs, and assess capabilities and their interoperability with current platforms, its requirements for the present RFP remain unchanged. Id. The Army explains that it communicated with MacAulay about halting, and potentially cancelling, the GDP under the OTA, not under this solicitation. Id. at 26. Further, the Army has provided a declaration stating that one week after award, it hosted an integration meeting to first discuss the ""development of a pilot"" to integrate the GDP and the GEF. AR, Tab 56, Declaration of Army Product Manager for Defense Cyber Operations, Cyber Platform Systems, at 1.
Our review of the record indicates that the Army had not actually changed its requirements prior to award. To the contrary, while the record indicates that it was contemplating potentially integrating existing infrastructures, no such change occurred prior to award. Further, the only changes that appear to have been made are with regard to a GDP OTA, which is not at issue here. It follows that the underlying premise of this protest basis--that the Army's requirements changed prior to award--lacks merit. 4
Untimely Allegations
MacAulay also argues that the Army unreasonably evaluated proposals based on the erroneous assumption that the Army could provide the BDP-GN with cloud functionality to Deloitte as GFE. MacAulay asserts that the BDP-GN will not function in the cloud without MacAulay's proprietary software, which the Army does not have the authorization to provide to Deloitte. Consolidated Protest at 26-29. MacAulay thus argues that Deloitte will be unable to deploy BDP-GN into a cloud environment, which was required by the solicitation, and that a reasonable evaluation would have reflected this by rating Deloitte marginal or unacceptable under the non-price factors. Id . at 28.
Our Bid Protest Regulations contain strict rules for the timely submission of protests. See 4 C.F.R. § 21.2(a). Pursuant to our timeliness rules, a protest based upon alleged improprieties in a solicitation, or allegedly flawed ground rules under which a competition is conducted, that are apparent prior to the closing time for receipt of proposals must be filed before that time. 4 C.F.R. § 21.2(a)(1); DynCorp Int'l LLC , B-415349, Jan. 3, 2018, 2018 CPD ¶ 12 at 9. A protester may not wait until after an award has been made to protest alleged flaws in the procurement's ground rules that are apparent prior to submission of proposals. 5 See DynCorp Int'l LLC , supra .
As noted above, the RFP stated that the Army would provide a BDP solution as GFE. AR, Tab 12, SOW at 6. Additionally, the SOW stated that offerors will be responsible for deploying analytics on four different infrastructure platforms, one of which was the cloud. Id. at 5, 11. The solicitation therefore required the awardee to deploy analytics capabilities in the cloud utilizing the BDP solution provided by the Army.
MacAulay alleges that the Army's current BDP--the GN--will not function in the cloud without MacAulay's proprietary software. We construe MacAulay as essentially arguing that it is the only firm that can satisfy the requirement to deploy analytics in the cloud with the Army's BDP, given that no other firm has authorization to use the proprietary software necessary to perform this requirement. However, the solicitation provided for competition on a full and open basis, thus contemplating that award could be made to a firm other than MacAulay. RFP at 2.
As a result, the Army's purportedly erroneous assumption that it could provide its BDP solution with cloud functionality to the eventual awardee was clear on the face of the solicitation. Thus, MacAulay's assertion that no firm other than itself can satisfy the requirements of the solution alleges an impropriety in the terms of the solicitation which MacAulay was required to protest prior to the receipt of proposals. Since it MacAulay failed to do so, we dismiss this allegation as untimely. 4 C.F.R. § 21.2(a)(1); see AOC Connect, LLC--Recon. , B-416658.3, Feb. 12, 2019, 2019 CPD ¶ __ at 3 (allegations that awardee's technical solution would not satisfy solicitation requirements is untimely where solicitation expressly provided that such a solution was ).
Use of FAR Part 13 Procedures
Finally, MacAulay argues that the Army improperly used the simplified acquisition procedures in FAR subpart 13.5 for this procurement. Consolidated and Supp. Protest at 24. MacAulay acknowledges that this protest ground is an untimely challenge to the terms of the solicitation, 6 but asks that we consider the issue under our significant issue exception to the timeliness rules. Id.
As a general rule, FAR subpart 13.5 authorizes the use of simplified acquisition procedures for procurements of commercial items when the value does not exceed $7 million. FAR § 13.500(a). Section 13.500(c) of the FAR raises the threshold for using simplified acquisition procedures to $13 million for procurements of commercial items that facilitate defense against or recovery from nuclear, biological, chemical, or radiological attack. 7 FAR § 13.500(c). In addition, section 1641 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017, Pub. Law No. 114-328, added cyber as a basis for using the simplified acquisition procedures authorized under FAR § 13.500(c). The Department of Defense subsequently issued a class deviation applicable to FAR § 13.500(c) to implement this statutory addition. See AR, Tab 71, Class Deviation No. 2018-00018, attach.1, at 4. Specifically, the class deviation permits defense agencies to use simplified acquisition procedures for acquisitions to facilitate defense against cyber attack when the acquisition value does not exceed $13 million. Id. at 5.
In addition to noting that this protest ground is untimely, the Army asserts that FAR § 18.202 provides it the authority to use simplified acquisition procedures for procurements, such as this one, valued above the $13 million limit imposed by FAR § 13.500(c), and modified by the above-referenced class deviation to include procurements to defend against cyber attacks. 8 Supp. MOL at 2-3.
MacAulay argues that the Army has violated the dollar limits set on the use of this authority in statute, in the FAR, and in the class deviation. Protester's Comments on Supp. AR on Use of FAR 13.5 at 2. MacAulay contends that there is no language in FAR § 18.202 that independently authorizes agencies to raise the simplified acquisition threshold above the level set in FAR § 13.500(c). Id. Instead, FAR § 18.202 simply refers the reader to other FAR provisions that authorize the use of simplified acquisition procedures, such as FAR § 13.500(c). Id. In this regard, MacAulay notes that the final rule implementing FAR part 18 explains that it ‟provides a single reference to the acquisition flexibilities already available in the FAR."" Id. at 3 (quoting FAR Case 2005-038, Emergency Acquisitions, 72 Fed. Reg. 46,343 (Aug. 17, 2007)).
Under 4 C.F.R. § 21.2(c), our Office may consider a protest that raises issues significant to the procurement system. What constitutes a significant issue is to be decided on a case-by-case basis. Cyberdata Techs., Inc. , B-406692, Aug. 8, 2012, 2012 CPD ¶ 230 at 3. GAO has limited this exception to protests that raise issues of widespread interest to the procurement community and that have not been considered on the merits in a previous decision. The record does not show that the issues raised are of widespread interest to the procurement community that would otherwise warrant their resolution in the context of an otherwise untimely protest allegation. We therefore decline to consider this issue under our significant issue exception to our timeliness rules. 9
The protest is denied.
General Counsel [1] ""Other transactions"" are legally-binding instruments, other than contracts, grants, or cooperative agreements, that generally are not subject to federal laws and regulations applicable to procurement contracts. These instruments are used for various purposes by federal agencies that have been granted statutory authority permitting their use. See Oracle America, Inc. , B-416061, May 31, 2018, 2018 CPD ¶ 180 at 1 n1. [2] The agency acknowledges that it erred in not factoring one of the 18 optional CLINs into the IGCE, but argues that this ""administrative error"" does not affect the reliability of the IGCE, nor was this error prejudicial to MacAulay. Supp. AR on IGCE, at 5. We agree. MacAulay proposed a price of $[deleted] for this CLIN, and Deloitte proposed $[deleted] for this CLIN. Neither amount would substantially affect the IGCE, or Deloitte's price in relation to the IGCE. [3] The record provides us with no basis to object to the evaluation of Deloitte's proposal and its purported failure to identify an inconsistency between its oral presentation, technical/management approach, and its price. In this regard, MacAulay has not actually identified a specific inconsistency between Deloitte's technical approach and price which is not derivative of its assertion that Deloitte's price is unrealistically low. [4] MacAulay also argued that the best-value tradeoff was unreasonable. As detailed above, the record does not support MacAulay's challenges to the evaluation of proposals. Accordingly, we find no merit to these objections to the selection decision, insofar as they are based upon those alleged errors. Further, on this record, we find nothing unreasonable, or inconsistent with the solicitation, in the selection official's decision to select, as between two technically equal proposals, Deloitte's lower-priced proposal. See Synergetics, Inc. , B-299904, Sept. 14, 2007, 2007 CPD ¶ 168 at 8. [5] This principle promotes fundamental fairness in the competitive process by preventing an offeror from taking advantage of the government, as well as other offerors, by waiting silently only to spring forward with an alleged defect in an effort to restart the procurement process, potentially armed with increased knowledge of its competitors' position or information. Blue & Gold Fleet, L.P. v. United States , 492 F.3d 1308, 1313-14 (Fed. Cir. 2007). [6] As noted above, pursuant to our timeliness rules, a protest based upon alleged improprieties in a solicitation, or allegedly flawed ground rules under which a competition is conducted, that are apparent prior to the closing time for receipt of proposals must be filed before that time. 4 C.F.R. § 21.2(a)(1). [7] Section 13.500(c) provides that ‟[u]nder 41 U.S.C. [§] 1903, the simplified acquisition procedures authorized in this [subpart 13.5] may be used for acquisitions that do not exceed $13 million when--(1) The acquisition is for commercial items that, as determined by the head of the agency, are to be used . . . to facilitate the defense against or recovery from nuclear, biological, chemical, or radiological attack."" [8] Section 18.202 states, in relevant part, that the threshold for the authority to use simplified procedures for certain commercial items ‟may be increased when it is determined the acquisition is to facilitate defense against or recovery from nuclear, biological, chemical, or radiological attack, (See 13.500(c))."" FAR § 18.202(d). [9] In any event, we agree with Deloitte that MacAulay has failed to demonstrate competitive prejudice due to the agency's alleged misuse of simplified acquisition procedures. Olympus America, Inc. , B-414944, Oct. 19, 2017, 2018 CPD ¶ 151 at 3-4. In its pleadings, MacAulay argues that it was prejudiced by the use of simplified procedures because had the agency utilized the procedures of FAR part 15, it would have had to evaluate past performance. Comments on AR at 28-29. Class Deviation 2018-00018 authorizes contracting officers to treat any acquisition of supplies or services that are to be used to facilitate defense against or recovery from cyber attacks as an acquisition of commercial items. It has not been disputed that, pursuant to this deviation, the agency properly utilized Part 12 procedures. Moreover, in FAR part 12 procurements, the evaluation of past performance is discretionary, not mandatory. See Finlen Complex, Inc . , B-288280, Oct. 10, 2001, 2001 CPD ¶ 167 at 6 (explaining that while FAR § 12.206's statement that ""[p]ast [p]erformance should be an important element of every evaluation"" urges agencies to consider past performance, it does not require them to do so). Further, FAR § 12.102(c) provides that ""[w]hen a policy in another part of the FAR is inconsistent with the policy in this part, this part 12 shall take precedence for the acquisition of commercial items."" Thus, had the agency utilized FAR Part 15 procedures in conjunction with FAR part 12, FAR part 12's permissive treatment of past performance would take precedence of FAR part 15's requirement that agencies must evaluate past performance. Accordingly, even if we were to find that the agency impermissibly utilized FAR part 13 procedures here, MacAulay still has not demonstrated prejudice by this error because the agency still would not have been required to evaluate past performance."

DECISION
Oppenheim Management, LLC, of Brooklyn, New York, protests the General Services Administration’s (GSA) exclusion of Oppenheim’s proposal from further consideration in a procurement, conducted pursuant to request for lease proposals (RLP) No. 7PA2333, to provide leased space for the U.S. Social Security Administration (SSA) in Scranton, Pennsylvania. Oppenheim asserts that the agency incorrectly determined that Oppenheim’s proposal failed to comply with the solicitation’s column spacing requirements, and complains that the agency failed to conduct discussions regarding that requirement. Additionally, Oppenheim asserts that exclusion of Oppenheim’s proposal “lacks a rational basis,” since its proposed building is capable of meeting the agency’s needs. Protest at 2.
We dismiss the protest.
BACKGROUND
In December 2018, the agency issued RLP No. 7PA2333 to provide leased space for the SSA in Scranton, Pennsylvania. Protest, exh. A, RLP. Among other things, the RLP provided that “space between columns and/or walls cannot be less than nineteen (19’) feet.” Id. at 2.
On December 14, the agency provided a copy of the RLP to representatives of Oppenheim, the incumbent lessor, noting that the SSA’s requirements had been “updated” and specifically advising Oppenheim that: “given the column spacing requirement [the SSA’s] current space does not meet [the updated] needs.” Protest, exh. K, E-mail from Contracting Officer to Oppenheim, Dec. 14, 2018.
On or before the solicitation’s January 11, 2019 closing date, Oppenheim submitted a proposal in which it, nonetheless, proposed the currently-leased building. In its proposal, Oppenheim asserted that its building conformed to the column spacing requirement when measuring from east to west --but expressly acknowledged that, measured from north to south, the “columns . . . are less than 19 feet apart.” Protest, exh. E, Oppenheim Proposal, at 8.
On January 24, the agency sent a letter to Oppenheim, which carried the subject line “Request for Clarifications” and noted that Oppenheim’s proposal contained various “exceptions” to the solicitation requirements. Protest, exh. F, Agency Letter to Oppenheim, at 1-2. Oppenheim acknowledges that, thereafter, on January 31, the agency’s contracting officer and Oppenheim’s representative “discussed the column spacing of the [p]roperty.” Protest at 7. As a follow-up to these discussions, the contracting officer forwarded to Oppenheim’s representative the floor plan for Oppenheim’s building--which expressly confirmed that the “column spacing measurements” were less than 19 feet. [1] Protest, exh. H, E-mail from Contracting Officer to Oppenheim Senior Vice President.
On February 5, Oppenheim submitted certain clarifications/revisions to its proposal, but again expressly acknowledged that, measured from north to south, its proposed building’s columns “are less than 19 feet apart.” Protest, exh. I, Revised Proposal, at 46.
On February 6, the agency notified Oppenheim that its proposal was being excluded from further consideration, stating: “Your offer is not as it does not meet the column spacing requirement stated in the RLP.” Protest, exh. B, E-mail from Contracting Officer to Oppenheim Senior Vice President. This protest followed.
DISCUSSION
Oppenheim’s protest asserts that the agency “incorrectly” determined that Oppenheim’s proposal failed to comply with the solicitation’s column spacing requirements, and complains that the agency failed to conduct meaningful discussions regarding that requirement. Additionally, the protester asserts that exclusion of Oppenheim’s proposal “lacks a rational basis,” since its proposed building is capable of meeting the agency’s needs. Protest at 2. Thereafter, the agency submitted a request for summary dismissal.
As discussed below, based on the face of Oppenheim’s protest and protest exhibits, we dismiss its allegation regarding the agency’s alleged “incorrect” determination that Oppenheim’s proposal failed to comply with the solicitation’s column spacing requirement, and we similarly dismiss Oppenheim’s assertions that the agency failed to conduct meaningful discussions regarding that requirement. We also dismiss as untimely Oppenheim’s assertion that exclusion of its proposal on the column spacing requirement was irrational.
First, Oppenheim asserts that the agency “incorrectly” concluded that Oppenheim’s proposal failed to comply with the solicitation’s column spacing requirements because Oppenheim’s proposal “offered a space . . . with columns spaced 20 feet apart . . . for the east – west orientation of the property, which is the [furniture] configuration SSA currently enjoys.” Protest at 9-10. The protester also asserts, without elaboration, that the agency’s discussions “failed to direct Oppenheim to the . . . deficiencies in its proposal.” Id. at 12.
In its dismissal request, the agency notes that the plain language of the solicitation, along with the agency’s explicit, documented communications with Oppenheim regarding the column spacing requirement, left no doubt that the spacing requirement applied to all of the columns--not just those aligned from east to west. Agency Dismissal Request, Mar. 4, 2019, at 4-8. The agency further points out that the agency communicated its view that Oppenheim’s building did not meet the requirements several times throughout the procurement, noting that Oppenheim’s own submissions establish the absence of any factual or legal support for either of these allegations.
It is well-settled that a proposal that fails to comply with the solicitation requirements cannot form a valid basis for award. See , e.g. , For Your Info., Inc. , B-278352, Dec. 15, 1997, 97-2 CPD ¶ 164 at 3. It is similarly well-settled that, while an agency’s discussions must be meaningful, an agency need only lead an offeror into the deficient area of its proposal to satisfy the requirement. See , e.g. , Hanford Envtl. Health Found. , B-292858.2, B-292858.5, Apr. 7, 2004, 2004 CPD ¶ 164 at 8. Finally, our Bid Protest Regulations provide that we will dismiss a protest allegation for failing to state a valid basis of protest when the allegation, on its face, fails to demonstrate improper agency action. 4 C.F.R. §§ 2.1(c)(4), (i); 21.5(f); see Brackett Aircraft Radio Co. , B‑246282, Jan. 8, 1992, 92-1 CPD ¶ 43 at 1 (dismissing allegation as failing to state valid basis when the allegation did not, on its face, demonstrate improper agency action).
Here, it is clear from the face of Oppenheim’s protest submissions unambiguously provided that “space between columns and/or walls cannot be less than nineteen (19’) feet,” Protest, exh. A, RLP at 2, and did not limit the spacing requirement to any particular alignment of the building columns. Accordingly, Oppenheim’s assertion--based on the proposition that the stated requirement was applicable only to the columns aligned from east to west--fails to state a basis for protest, and is dismissed.
Similarly, with regard to the agency’s alleged failure to conduct meaningful discussions, Oppenheim’s protest includes the agency’s December 14 e-mail, in which the agency advised Oppenheim that the SSA’s requirements had been updated and explicitly stated: “given the column spacing requirement [the SSA’s] current space does not meet [the updated] needs.” Protest, exh. K, E-Mail from Contracting Officer to Oppenheim. Further, Oppenheim’s protest, itself, acknowledges that, on January 31, following submission of Oppenheim’s proposal, the contracting officer and Oppenheimer’s Senior Vice President “discussed the column spacing of the [p]roperty.” Protest at 7. Accordingly, on the face of Oppenheim’s protest submissions, there is no basis to assert that the agency failed to lead Oppenheim into the deficient area of its proposal, and that protest allegation is dismissed.
Finally, Oppenheim asserts that exclusion of its proposal was irrational because “GSA and SSA have demonstrated that they are able to use the space being offered without any impact to their furniture layout or their operations.” Protest at 2.
The agency’s dismissal request points out that Oppenheim’s complaint in this regard is an untimely challenge to the agency’s need for the solicitation’s column spacing requirement and, since this allegation was filed after the solicitation’s closing date, it must be dismissed.
GAO’s bid protest regulations contain strict rules for the timely submission of protests, reflecting the dual requirements of giving parties a fair opportunity to present their cases and resolving protests expeditiously without unduly disrupting or delaying the procurement process. See , e.g. , Verizon Wireless , B-406854, B-406854,2, Sept. 17, 2012, 2012 CPD ¶ 260 at 3, 4. A protest based on alleged solicitation improprieties must be filed prior to the time set for receipt of proposals. 4 C.F.R. § 21.2(a)(2).
Here, Oppenheim’s assertion that exclusion of its proposal “lacks a rational basis” because, in Oppenheim’s view, its proposed building would meet the agency’s needs, constitutes a challenge to the necessity of the column spacing requirement. As discussed above, this requirement was clearly apparent prior to submission of Oppenheim’s proposal. Nonetheless, Oppenheim chose not to challenge that requirement before the solicitation closing date. On this record, its protest challenging the column spacing requirement is untimely, and will not be considered.
The protest is dismissed.
