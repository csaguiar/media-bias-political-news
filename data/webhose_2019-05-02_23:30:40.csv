"Sheriff Willing To Go To Jail Over Red Flag Gun Law: ""It's A Matter Of Doing What's Right""",www.zerohedge.com,Tyler Durden,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2019-04-02/sheriff-willing-go-jail-over-red-flag-gun-law-its-matter-doing-whats-right,"
A Colorado sheriff has stated that he opposes a proposed new gun control law so much that he is willing to go to jail rather than enforce it.
Weld County Sheriff Steve Reams told CNN that “It’s a matter of doing what’s right.”
Here’s a bit of background on the bill Reams is referring to. It is likely to become law this week. The law Reams says he will not enforce is a red flag gun confiscation law.
House Bill 19-1177, also known as a red flag bill or the Extreme Risk Protection Orders bill, passed the Colorado Senate 18-17 on Thursday and is scheduled Monday for the House floor. With Democratic majorities in both chambers, state Republicans have too few votes to stop the bill.
Last month, we reported that legislators and sheriffs in the state have been pushing back against the bill:
Officially called Extreme Risk Protection Orders (ERPO), “red flag” laws permit police, healthcare providers, or family members to petition a state court to order the temporary removal of firearms from a person who may present a danger to others or themselves.
Weld County recently joined the growing list of counties in Colorado that have passed Second Amendment Sanctuary resolutions in response to the impending red flag law.
For a full analysis and critique of this bill, give this a read: Kopel and Greenlee: Plenty of red flags in Colorado’s ‘extreme risk’ protection order bill . ( source )
We also reported that Reams (among others) is in opposition to the bill:
Commissioner Barbara Kirkmeyer, one of HB 19-1177’s harshest critics, said “The severity of this bill cannot be overstated. The name of this bill is the Extreme Risk Protection Orders. I think that’s a façade, and I think it’s fraudulent. I think actually, this bill should have been titled: ‘The Extreme Order to Confiscate Your Firearms, Eliminate Due Process, and Violate your Constitutional Rights Bill.”
Weld County Sheriff Steve Reams agrees :
“The bill is so riddled with constitutional problems that it makes it hard to understand how professional lawmakers could have constructed something so terrible,” Reams said, adding the bill, “raises some serious concerns about due process, in that a person can have their guns taken away and their rights violated, all without ever having a chance to appear in an initial court hearing and cross examine accusers and witnesses in person. In legal terms, this is an exparte hearing.” ( source )
Reams added that one of the biggest problems with the law is it does not address actual mental health issues – it only allows for guns to be taken away, leaving the person in the same position and without medical help. ( source ) Sheriffs could find themselves locked inside of their own jails for refusing to enforce gun control laws.
Failure to enforce a court order to seize a person’s guns could mean sheriffs being found in contempt. A judge could fine them indefinitely, or even send them to jail to force them to comply.
Reams told CNN it’s a sacrifice he’d be forced to make.
He isn’t the only sheriff to voice opposition to red flag laws. A growing number of states, counties, cities, and towns are declaring themselves “Second Amendment Sanctuaries” and are refusing to enforce gun-control laws that infringe on the Constitutional right to keep and bear arms.
David Kopel, a constitutional law expert who has written extensively about gun policy in the United States, says he thinks the bill is generally a good idea but that he has serious reservations about how it is written, reports CNN :
“The gun ban lobbies are getting more and more extreme and aggressive,” he said.
The bill allows a judge to order a person’s guns to be seized before the person has a chance to appear in court. The bill does require a second hearing with the gun owner present to be held within 14 days, where the owner could make a case to keep the weapons — but if the owner is unsuccessful, a judge could order the guns seized for as long as a year.
Kopel said it would be difficult to prevent a nightmare scenario in which someone misuses the law to take guns away from a person they intend to target violently.
The burden of proof is low — “preponderance of the evidence,” which is the same standard used in civil cases, and a much lower bar than the criminal standard, “beyond a reasonable doubt.” ( source )
Reams added that he is concerned about the potential to aggravate an already volatile person by taking their weapons:
“Going in and taking their guns and leaving the scene, I can’t see how that makes them less of a risk. It just takes one tool away,” said Reams, arguing that a person bent on hurting someone could do it with a knife or a car. ( source )
He makes a great point. Last October, Maryland’s red flag law went into effect. Less than a month later, the law claimed its first victim . Gary J. Willis was killed by police when they showed up at his home at 5 am to serve him with a court order requiring that he surrender his guns. Reams is not the only sheriff who is publicly voiced his intent to not enforce unconstitutional gun control laws.
Back in February, a group of sheriffs from New Mexico did the same:
Of the 33 sheriffs in the state, 29 have voiced disapproval of the package of anti-gun legislation by issuing a declaration through the state sheriffs’ association, stating that the “rush to react to the violence by proposing controls on guns is ill-conceived and is truly a distraction to the real problems proliferating violence in our counties and our state.” ( source )
And, earlier this year, some sheriffs in Washington state publicly vowed not to enforce new unconstitutional gun laws.
In a statement, Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser said he is “confident that when and if the time comes, all law enforcement officials will follow the rule of law.”
But Reams said he is serious: “I’ve explained that time and time again,” he said . “I’m not bluffing.” Tags "
"The Newest AI-Enabled Weapon: ""Deep-Faking"" Photos Of The Earth",www.zerohedge.com,Tyler Durden,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2019-04-02/newest-ai-enabled-weapon-deep-faking-photos-earth,"
Step 1: Use AI to make undetectable changes to outdoor photos.
Step 2: release them into the open-source world and enjoy the chaos.
Worries about deep fakes — machine-manipulated videos of celebrities and world leaders purportedly saying or doing things that they really didn’t — are quaint compared to a new threat: doctored images of the Earth itself.
China is the acknowledged leader in using an emerging technique called generative adversarial networks to trick computers into seeing objects in landscapes or in satellite images that aren’t there, says Todd Myers, automation lead for the CIO-Technology Directorate at the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency.
“The Chinese are well ahead of us. This is not classified info,” Myers said Thursday at the second annual Genius Machines summit, hosted by Defense One and Nextgov.
“The Chinese have already designed; they’re already doing it right now, using GANs—which are generative adversarial networks —to manipulate scenes and pixels to create things for nefarious reasons.”
For example, Myers said, an adversary might fool your computer-assisted imagery analysts into reporting that a bridge crosses an important river at a given point.
“So from a tactical perspective or mission planning, you train your forces to go a certain route, toward a bridge, but it’s not there. Then there’s a big surprise waiting for you,” he said.
First described in 2014 , GANs represent a big evolution in the way neural networks learn to see and recognize objects and even detect truth from fiction.
Say you ask your conventional neural network to figure out which objects are what in satellite photos. The network will break the image into multiple pieces, or pixel clusters, calculate how those broken pieces relate to one another, and then make a determination about what the final product is, or, whether the photos are real or doctored. It’s all based on the experience of looking at lots of satellite photos.
GANs reverse that process by pitting two networks against one another — hence the word “adversarial.” A conventional network might say, “The presence of x, y, and z in these pixel clusters means this is a picture of a cat.” But a GAN network might say, “This is a picture of a cat, so x, y, and z must be present. What are x, y, and z and how do they relate?” The adversarial network learns how to construct, or generate, x, y, and z in a way that convinces the first neural network, or the discriminator, that something is there when, perhaps, it is not.
A lot of scholars have found GANs useful for spotting objects and sorting valid images from fake ones. In 2017, Chinese scholars used GANs to identify roads, bridges, and other features in satellite photos.
The concern, as AI technologists told Quartz last year, is that the same technique that can discern real bridges from fake ones can also help create fake bridges that AI can’t tell from the real thing.
Myers worries that as the world comes to rely more and more on open-source images to understand the physical terrain, just a handful of expertly manipulated data sets entered into the open-source image supply line could create havoc. “Forget about the [Department of Defense] and the [intelligence community]. Imagine Google Maps being infiltrated with that, purposefully? And imagine five years from now when the Tesla [self-driving] semis are out there routing stuff?” he said.
When it comes to deep fake videos of people, biometric indicators like pulse and speech can defeat the fake effect. But faked landscape isn’t vulnerable to the same techniques.
Even if you can defeat GANs, a lot of image-recognition systems can be fooled by adding small visual changes to the physical objects in the environment themselves, such as stickers added to stop signs that are barely noticeable to human drivers but that can throw off machine vision systems, as DARPA program manager Hava Siegelmann has demonstrated .
Myers says the military and intelligence community can defeat GAN, but it’s time-consuming and costly, requiring multiple, duplicate collections of satellite images and other pieces of corroborating evidence.
“For every collect, you have to have a duplicate collect of what occurred from different sources,” he said.
“Otherwise, you’re trusting the one source.”
The challenge is both a technical and a financial one.
“The biggest thing is the funding required to make sure you can do what I just talked about,” he said.
On Thursday, U.S. officials confirmed that data integrity is a rising concern... "
Overnight Health Care: Dem senators offer 'Medicare X' bill | McConnell tells Trump Senate won't take up ObamaCare repeal | Insulin makers to testify | Scalise moves to force vote on abortion bill,thehill.com,"jhellman@thehill.com (Jessie Hellmann, Nathaniel Weixel and Peter Sullivan)",04-03-2019,2019,4,https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/overnights/437026-overnight-health-care-bennet-kaine-intro-medicare-x-would-create-public,"Hillary Diane Rodham Clinton Note to Team Mueller: If you don't indict, you can't incite WikiLeaks: Assange will be expelled from Ecuadorian Embassy within 'hours to days' New Mexico gov signs bill granting electoral votes to national popular vote winner MORE 's running mate in 2016.
Why it matters: It shows yet another divide within the Democratic party about what the next steps should be on health care. While Medicare for all has been embraced by several 2020 presidential contenders, some would likely say this bill doesn't go far enough.
As Kaine said in the call, the bill ""preserves everything about the existing system."" But that would face opposition from progressive Democrats who consider the current 'system' to be the problem with rising health costs in the U.S.
Context: This is just one of many proposals to expand Medicare but will likely be part of the discussion should Democrats gain more power in the 2020 elections.
Democrats rally at Supreme Court ahead of ObamaCare vote
House and Senate Democrats rallied on the steps of the Supreme Court Tuesday ahead of a vote on a resolution asking the Department of Justice (DOJ) to reverse its decision to side with a lower court ruling ObamaCare unconstitutional.
The symbolic resolution will likely pass the Democratic-controlled House Wednesday, but it won't get a vote in the Senate, where Republicans are in the majority.
But it gives Democrats another chance to highlight the Trump administration's efforts to repeal ObamaCare, which they see as a winning issue ahead of the 2020 elections.
""We need our Republican colleagues to come to the table and defend their constituents instead of the president,"" said Sen. Jeanne Shaheen Cynthia (Jeanne) Jeanne Shaheen More than 30 Senate Dems ask Trump to reconsider Central American aid cuts Menendez, Rubio lead Senate effort to regulate Venezuelan sanctions Overnight Health Care: Dem senators offer 'Medicare X' bill | McConnell tells Trump Senate won't take up ObamaCare repeal | Insulin makers to testify | Scalise moves to force vote on abortion bill MORE (D-N.H.), the Senate sponsor of the resolution.
Why it matters: Democrats want to keep drawing attention to the Trump administration's actions in the ObamaCare lawsuit, viewing it as a winning issue ahead of 2020. The House will also vote on the resolution tomorrow, forcing Republicans to take another hard vote on health care.
The other side: Republicans note that the resolution is meaningless, and argue that Democrats aren't actually doing anything to protect people should the law be struck down. Republicans have been pushing for a vote on a bill that they say would protect people with pre-existing conditions, but Democrats said it doesn't go far enough.
McConnell to Trump: We're not repealing and replacing ObamaCare
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is making it clear that he does not want to dive back into the ObamaCare repeal debate that ended in failure for his party in 2017.
McConnell told President Trump in a conversation Monday that the Senate will not be moving comprehensive health care legislation before the 2020 election, despite the president asking Senate Republicans to do that in a meeting last week.
""We had a good conversation yesterday afternoon and I pointed out to him the Senate Republicans' view on dealing with comprehensive health care reform with a Democratic House of Representatives,"" McConnell told reporters Tuesday, describing his conversation with Trump.
The politics : With Democratic control of the House, there is no chance of actually signing into law ObamaCare repeal legislation before 2021. Therefore, reopening the debate means diving back into an issue that divides Republicans and galvanizes Democrats.
What to watch for : McConnell and other Republicans will try to keep the attention on Medicare for all, which they see as a political loser for Democrats.
Another issue where the GOP wants to put the focus instead... abortion. Steve Scalise Stephen (Steve) Joseph Scalise House votes to reauthorize Violence Against Women Act, closing 'boyfriend loophole' Trump said 'who the f--- are you' to GOP lawmaker after criticism of tweets: New book Overnight Health Care: Dem senators offer 'Medicare X' bill | McConnell tells Trump Senate won't take up ObamaCare repeal | Insulin makers to testify | Scalise moves to force vote on abortion bill MORE is moving to force a floor vote on an abortion bill.
House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) on Tuesday took a step toward forcing a floor vote on legislation that would require medical care protections for infants that survive an abortion.
Introduction of the discharge petition is the latest attempt by Republicans to circumvent Democratic control of the House floor and force members across the aisle to cast a vote on a politically divisive topic.
""It should be the easiest decision to make, to sign the discharge petition,"" Scalise told The Hill. ""Whether you're pro-life or pro-choice you should be able to stand up for babies who were born alive outside the womb.""
But opponents of the bill, like Planned Parenthood, say it's an effort to criminalize doctors and further stigmatize abortion.
""Today's filing was yet another out of touch attack on women's health and rights – based on dangerous lies,"" said Jacqueline Ayers, vice president of government relations for Planned Parenthood.
""Republican leadership is shaming women and criminalizing doctors for a practice that doesn't exist in reality.
Insulin manufacturers to testify as part of House pricing probe
The only three companies that manufacture insulin in the United States will testify in the House next week about their pricing practices.
Diana Louise DeGette Overnight Health Care: Lawmakers get deal to advance long-stalled drug pricing bill | House votes to condemn Trump's anti-ObamaCare push | Eight House Republicans join with Dems | Trump officials approve Medicaid expansion in Maine GOP lawmaker to propose raising tobacco age of sale to 21 Overnight Health Care: Dem senators offer 'Medicare X' bill | McConnell tells Trump Senate won't take up ObamaCare repeal | Insulin makers to testify | Scalise moves to force vote on abortion bill MORE (D-Colo.), chairwoman of the House Energy and Commerce oversight subcommittee, said the three companies-- Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk and Sanofi-- will testify April 10.
""We want to know why the cost of this life-saving drug has skyrocketed in recent years, and why they're not offering more lower-cost alternatives to patients,"" DeGette said.
The hearing will be the committee's second in two weeks examining rising insulin prices, and what Congress can do to make the drug more affordable.
Degette said the panel will also hear from the three largest pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) about their role.
Drug pricing is complicated: Drugmakers say the list price of insulin isn't what patients actually pay, because secret rebates negotiated by pharmacy benefit managers will reduce it.
Insurers say they spread the savings from discounts to lower overall premiums. For the first time, there are bipartisan and bicameral probes from the top health care committees to get to the bottom of it.
Former Massachusetts AG joins e-cigarette maker Juul
Former Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley (D) is joining the government affairs team at e-cigarette maker Juul, the company said Tuesday.
Coakley, who previously lost races for Senate and governor in Massachusetts, will be working primarily with state officials, regulators and organizations to educate them on ways Juul is fighting underage use.
She had been advising Juul for several months as a partner at the law firm Foley Hoag.
Juul is the country's most dominant vaping manufacturer. Late last year, the country's largest cigarette company, Altria, which makes Marlboro cigarettes, spent more than $12 billion to buy a 35 percent stake in Juul.
Meanwhile: Coakley's successor, Maura Healey, is currently investigating Juul and other online e-cigarette retailers over concerns about the marketing and sale of e-cigarettes to minors.
HHS inspector general resigns
Daniel Levinson, the head of the agency's watchdog division, announced Tuesday he will be stepping down from his position effective at the end of May. Levinson served for 15 years. Principal Deputy Inspector General Joanne Chiedl, who has worked alongside Levinson for nine years, will step in as acting inspector general on June 1.
""Dan Levinson has been a valued friend and colleague since our time together beginning at HHS in the 2000s, and all of HHS is grateful for his more than three decades of federal service,"" Secretary Alex Azar said in a statement.

Breakfast Isn't Important,reason.com,John Stossel,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://reason.com/archives/2019/04/03/breakfast-isnt-important,"I skipped breakfast again this morning. I won't worry about it.
Yes, I've heard the advice. ""It's the most important meal of the day."" It balances blood sugar levels, kick-starts your metabolism, stimulates the brain, etc.
A Harvard University study said men who regularly skip breakfast have a 27 percent higher risk of suffering a heart attack. Twenty-seven percent!
But I'm not worried, because I now know there's no proof that skipping breakfast causes heart attacks or any other problem.
In my latest video, nutritionist Dr. Ruth Kava points out that just about all the claims about breakfast being especially important are unproven.
Those Harvard researchers actually say it ""remains unknown whether specific eating habits…influence…heart disease risk.""
Strokes and heart attack news persists in part because people who skip breakfast tend to have other bad habits, like smoking.
But the breakfast bunk keeps coming.
Several years ago, the government announced that skipping breakfast may make you fat. Of course, the media jumped on that one. ""Missing breakfast tricks your brain into thinking you want higher-calorie foods,"" says WebMD.
""Far from making you fat, breakfast actually helps activate your metabolism so you start burning fat,"" says StepToHealth.com.
But it's not true, shows a new analysis by the British Medical Journal .
""They looked on a number of different studies, and they did not find that eating breakfast…helped people lose weight,"" says Kava.
The government has backed away from its claim.
Why did researchers and the government get it so wrong?
Partly because eating habits are hard to study. You can't follow test subjects for years, continuously controlling what they eat.
So, many studies are based on what people (SET ITAL)say(END ITAL) they ate. Some people forget. Or lie.
Many of us have been suckered by studies funded by cereal makers. Five of 15 studies mentioned by the government in its breakfast push were funded by General Mills or Kellogg.

"Gravity Knives, Bump Stocks, and Lawless Law Enforcement",reason.com,Jacob Sullum,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://reason.com/archives/2019/04/03/gravity-knives-bump-stocks-and-lawless-l,"When Joseph Cracco bought his folding knife about a decade ago, he had no reason to think he was breaking the law. Nor did Damien Guedes when he bought a bump stock for his AR-15 rifle in 2014.
Both products were subsequently transformed into contraband—not by legislators but by law enforcement officials. The way that happened shows how easily policies aimed at promoting public safety can make all of us less secure by undermining the rule of law.
Last week Cracco, a Manhattan sous chef, won a federal lawsuit he filed after he was arrested for violating New York's 1958 ban on ""gravity knives."" That law makes it a misdemeanor to possess ""any knife which has a blade which is released from the handle or sheath thereof by the force of gravity or the application of centrifugal force which, when released, is locked in place by means of a button, spring, lever or other device.""
For years Cracco had been using his Spyderco Endura 4 folding knife , the sort of tool that is sold openly by retailers in New York City and throughout the state, for mundane tasks like opening boxes and bottles. On a Friday afternoon in October 2013, Cracco was standing on a subway platform, heading home to Connecticut, when a police officer spotted the knife clipped to his pants pocket and subjected it to the NYPD's notorious ""wrist flick test.""
According to Cracco and a co-worker who was with him, it took the cop four or five tries before he managed to swing the blade fully open with one hand—a feat that Cracco himself had never attempted. Cracco thus joined the thousands of New Yorkers who are arrested each year for carrying the tools of their trades or hobbies.
""Because the wrist flick test is a functional one, it is difficult if not impossible for a person who wishes to possess a folding knife to determine whether or not the knife is illegal,"" U.S. District Judge Paul Crotty noted in a March 27 decision declaring the gravity knife ban ""unconstitutionally vague"" as applied to Cracco. ""People should be able to tell whether their conduct is lawful or unlawful.""
That bedrock principle of due process was even more flagrantly violated by the ban on ""bump-stock-type devices"" that took effect last week. The ban, which Donald Trump decided to unilaterally impose after such devices were used by the perpetrator of the 2017 mass shooting in Las Vegas, turned peaceful, law-abiding gun owners into felons for owning products that had been repeatedly deemed legal by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) during the Obama administration.
Bump stocks facilitate a fast rifle shooting technique in which the shooter pushes the gun forward so that the trigger is activated by a stationary finger, at which point recoil energy causes the gun to slide backward, resetting the trigger. Contradicting what the ATF had consistently told bump stock manufacturers and members of Congress , the Trump administration declared that rifles equipped with these accessories are illegal machine guns.
As Damien Guedes and other bump stock owners point out in their challenge to the ban, that conclusion is plainly at odds with the legal definition of a machine gun, which requires that the weapon fire ""automatically"" and ""more than one shot"" by ""a single function of the trigger."" Bump firing is not automatic, since it requires the shooter's active intervention, and it entails resetting the trigger after each round, as with any semi-automatic weapon.
The question raised by Guedes' lawsuit is not whether banning bump stocks is a good idea. The question is whether bump stocks are already banned .
By pretending they are, Trump is usurping congressional authority and criminalizing conduct that everyone thought was legal until he arbitrarily decreed that it wasn't. Like the cop who decided that Joseph Cracco's pocket tool was a forbidden weapon, the president is making up the law on the fly.

Guest Post: Colorado should set bold climate change goals,www.coloradoindependent.com,,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.coloradoindependent.com/2019/04/02/colorado-climate-change-goals/,"
The Colorado General Assembly soon will consider establishing additional climate goals for our state. The bill, HB19-1261 , would set goals of a 50% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and a 90% emissions reduction by 2050, both compared to 2005 levels. The bill also reaffirms the goal set by Gov. John Hickenlooper before he left office: a 26% emissions reduction by 2025.
While the new goals might sound ambitious, the Colorado Coalition for a Livable Climate (CCLC) is calling for the 2030 goal to be strengthened – instead of 50% reduction by 2030, the CCLC seeks a 63% reduction by then. This higher benchmark aligns with the best available science and would offer a better-than-even chance of limiting the average temperature rise to 1.5 degrees C (2.7 degree Fahrenheit) across the globe, if extended worldwide.
The report released last October by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) concludes planetary warming must not exceed 1.5 degrees C over the next 20 years. A half degree higher than that could be disastrous. A world that is warmer by 1.5 degrees C would see fewer extreme heat waves and resultant deaths, fewer extreme precipitation events and associated flooding, fewer extreme droughts and attendant forest fires and crop losses, lower sea level rise and associated inundation of coastal areas and islands, and the loss of fewer animal species compared to a world that is 2 degrees C (3.6 Fahrenheit) warmer.
HB19-1261 rightly acknowledges that global warming must be limited to 1.5 degrees C.
Unfortunately, the greenhouse gas emissions-reduction goals outlined in the bill would NOT result in limiting the global average temperature rise to 1.5° if extended worldwide. Instead, they would result in the greater, 2 degree C global temperature rise. The reason: The emissions reductions are not enough. Some countries would have to cut them more than 63% by 2030 to keep warming to 1.5 degrees C. CCLC believes Colorado should be a good neighbor and share the burden equally with other states and countries. We believe this inconsistency in the bill should be swiftly addressed and remedied by adopting CCLC’s goal of 63% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030.
The existing goal for 2025 plus this more ambitious 2030 goal would put Colorado on a straight line path toward net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2035. We recommend that the last emissions-reduction percentage we need to put us over the finish line – net-zero emissions – be set sometime over the next decade.
These cuts – extended worldwide – WOULD be likely to keep the global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees and thereby most adequately address the climate crisis. The CCLC developed these recommendations in conjunction with Scott Denning, Monfort Professor of Atmospheric Science at Colorado State University. These recommendations align closely with those included in the October 2018 IPCC Report for a 66% probability of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees C by the end of the 21 st century.
HB19-1261 calls for Colorado to exercise “a leadership role” on climate, which would “position its economy, technology centers, financial institutions, and businesses to benefit from national and international efforts to reduce greenhouse gases.” The CCLC urges our legislators to establish a true climate leadership role for Colorado by adopting a bold 63% emissions reduction goal for 2030. Our children and future generations will thank them for doing their part to preserve a livable climate.

How Do You Justify A $750 Billion Budget? – Bracing Views,bracingviews.com,,04-02-2019,2019,4,https://bracingviews.com/2019/04/02/how-do-you-justify-a-750-billion-budget/,"How Do You Justify A $750 Billion Budget? Missile Envy
W.J. Astore
I grew up on a steady diet of threat inflation. Before I was born, bomber and missile “gaps” had been falsely touted as showing the Soviet Union was ahead of the U.S. in developing nuclear-capable weaponry (the reverse was true). But those lies, which vastly exaggerated Soviet capabilities, perfectly served the needs of the military-industrial complex (hereafter, the Complex) in the USA. Another example of threat inflation, common when I was a kid, was the Domino Theory, the idea that, if South Vietnam fell to communism, the entire region of Southeast Asia would fall as well, including Thailand and perhaps even countries like the Philippines. Inflating the danger of communism was always a surefire method to promote U.S. defense spending and the interests of the Pentagon.
When I was in college, one book that opened my eyes was Andrew Cockburn’s “The Threat: Inside the Soviet Military Machine.” James Fallows’s “National Defense” was another book I read in those days, together with Helen Caldicott’s “Missile Envy.” Early in the Reagan years, I recall those old charts that displayed Soviet ICBMs as being bigger than American ICBMs, as if missile size was everything. The message was clear: the Soviets have more missiles, and they’re bigger! Yet what really mattered was the accuracy and reliability of those missiles, areas where the U.S. had a decisive edge. U.S. nuclear forces were also far more survivable than their Soviet counterparts, but such details were lost on most Americans.
Throughout my life, the U.S. “defense” establishment has consistently inflated the dangers presented by foreign powers, which brings me to the current Pentagon budget for 2020, which may reach $750 billion. How to justify such an immense sum? A large dollop of threat inflation might help…
With the Islamic State allegedly defeated in Syria and other terrorist forces more nuisances than existential threats, with the Afghan War apparently winding down (only 14,000 U.S. troops are deployed there) and with Trump professing a “love” fest with Kim Jong-un, where are today’s (and tomorrow’s) big threats? Iran isn’t enough. The only threats that seem big enough to justify colossal military spending are Russia and China . Hence the new “cold war” we keep hearing about, which drives a “requirement” for big spending on lucrative weapons systems like new aircraft carriers, new fighters and bombers, newer and better nuclear warheads and missiles, and so forth.
Which brings me to the alleged Russian collusion story involving Trump. As we now know, the Mueller Report found no collusion , but was that really the main point of the investigation and all the media hysteria? The latter succeeded in painting Vladimir Putin and the Russians as enemies in pursuit of the death of American democracy. Meanwhile Trump, who’d campaigned with some idea of a rapprochement with Russia, was driven by the investigation to take harsher stances against Russia, if only to prove he wasn’t a “Putin puppet.” The result: most Americans today see Russia as a serious threat, even though the Russians spend far less on wars and weaponry than the U.S. does.
Threat inflation is nothing new , of course. Dwight D. Eisenhower recognized it and did his best to control it in the 1950s, but even Ike had only limited success. Other presidents, lacking Ike’s military experience and gravitas, have most frequently surrendered to the Complex. The last president who tried with some consistency to control the Complex was Jimmy Carter, but the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, the Iranian hostage crisis, and his own political fortunes drove him to launch a major military buildup, which was then accelerated by Reagan until the collapse of the Soviet Union.
In the early 1990s, I briefly heard about a peace dividend and America returning to being a normal country (i.e. anti-imperial) in normal times, but ambition and greed reared their ugly heads, and U.S. leaders became enamored with military power. Rather than receding, America’s global empire grew , with no peace dividends forthcoming. The attacks on 9/11 led the Bush/Cheney administration to double down on military action in its “global war on terror,” leading to disastrous invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq that further served to engorge the Complex with money and power.
Today, faced with a debilitating national debt of $22 trillion and infrastructure that’s aptly described as “crumbling,” you’d think U.S. leaders would finally seek a peace dividend to lower our debt and rebuild our roads, bridges, dams, and related infrastructure. But the Complex (including Congress, of course) is addicted to war and weapons spending, aided as ever by threat inflation and its close cousin, fearmongering about invading aliens at the border.
And there you have it: a $750 billion military budget sucking up more than sixty percent of discretionary spending by the federal government. As Ike said , this is no way to live humanely, but it is a way for humanity to hang from a cross of iron. Share this: "

Posted on April 2, 2019 by sundance
Nellie Ohr is the wife of DOJ official Bruce Ohr. Nellie Ohr, a specialist in Russian matters, was also a contract employee of the CIA for multiple years. In September 2015 Nellie Ohr approached her former colleague at Fusion GPS (Glenn Simpson) for a job.
Nellie Ohr was hired as a contract agent by Fusion to work on the ‘Trump Project’ assembling political opposition research that was later shared with another Fusion GPS contract employee, Christopher Steele, and compiled into the ‘Steele Dossier’.
It always seemed sketchy that at the same time Nellie Ohr began communicating with Christopher Steele and other governmental participants associated with the Steele Dossier, May 2016, she applied for a Ham Radio License [FCC LINK]:
During congressional testimony, Nellie Ohr was asked when and why she obtained the Ham radio operators license. Ms. Ohr testified she obtained the license in 2015, “well before” she began working for Fusion GPS. Obviously this statement conflicts with the public FCC record showing she obtained the license in May 2016.
(Transcript Link)
Just to make sure the public FCC link date was accurate, Techno Fog filed a FOIA request to verify the application and approval date. The result was confirmation of May 23, 2016

Historically, before he became Prime Minister of Italy, Benito Mussolini had been a newspaper editor. After he became Il Duce, he continued the practice. He would read the morning paper, and if they printed an article he didn't like, he would mark it up with a red pencil, send it back to them and they would have to reprint it the way he wanted it to be."
