The Democratic Party is again trying to manipulate its presidential primary elections, President Donald Trump suggested in a two-part tweet on Saturday night.

“The Democratic National Committee, sometimes referred to as the DNC, is again working its magic in its quest to destroy Crazy Bernie Sanders....,” the president began, following those remarks with: “....for the more traditional, but not very bright, Sleepy Joe Biden. Here we go again Bernie, but this time please show a little more anger and indignation when you get screwed!“

Sanders, whom Trump frequently refers to as “Crazy Bernie,” doesn’t usually get Trump‘s sympathy or support, except when the president is implying that Democrats are doing inappropriate things to keep him away from the party’s presidential nomination. It was a common refrain by Trump both during and after Sanders’ battle with Hillary Clinton. “Bernie Sanders supporters have every right to be apoplectic of the complete theft of the Dem primary by Crooked Hillary!,” he tweeted in November 2017.

During the 2016 campaign, he frequently coupled that with a suggestion that Sanders should decline to endorse Clinton and instead run as an independent — clearly a divide-and-conquer strategy on his part.

“Bernie Sanders has been treated terribly by the Democrats—both with delegates & otherwise. He should show them, & run as an Independent,” he tweeted on May 5, 2016. He added two weeks later: “Bernie Sanders is being treated very badly by the Democrats - the system is rigged against him. Many of his disenfranchised fans are for me!“

Trump Rallies Supporters As White House Correspondents' Gala Celebrates A Free Press,https://www.npr.org,['Francesca Paris'],04-28-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/28/717908787/trump-rallies-supporters-as-white-house-correspondents-gala-celebrates-a-free-pr,"Trump Rallies Supporters As White House Correspondents' Gala Celebrates A Free Press

Separate events held Saturday evening in the nation's capital and a Wisconsin arena painted two divergent pictures of the press.

In Washington, the White House Correspondents' Association dinner, an annual comedic event, was light on jokes and replete instead with warnings about the consequences of attacks on the free press.

Meanwhile, President Trump rallied supporters in Green Bay, touting economic growth and repeating familiar calls of ""fake news"" to a cheering crowd.

He also disparaged special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation, mocked Democratic presidential contenders Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren and boasted about the media presence at his rally. ""Can you imagine Sleepy Joe, Crazy Bernie. ... Can you imagine any of those people up here doing what I'm doing?"" he said.

""I think, Pocahontas, she's finished, she's out, she's gone,"" he said as well, using his preferred nickname for Warren.

The president's decision to skip the glitzy, annual event in favor of a campaign rally came as no surprise. Trump has avoided the dinner every year since he became president, breaking with more than three decades of tradition.

And while some White House officials had planned to attend as guests of the various news organizations that the event honors, the administration announced last Tuesday that it would completely boycott the celebration.

Olivier Knox, WHCA president, asked attendees of the dinner to turn their attention to journalists who are ""suffering for their craft"" around the world and to advocate for the release of Austin Tice, a freelance journalist kidnapped while reporting in Syria in 2012.

""This is not [Trump's] dinner — it is ours,"" said Knox. ""And it should stay ours.""

In another break with tradition, the evening's keynote address was delivered by historian Ron Chernow. The dinner has typically featured a comedian cracking jokes at the expense of the president, who has also usually offered up his own roast of other politicians and the media.

The change in format followed a controversial performance last year by comedian Michelle Wolf, who faced criticism for her remarks — mostly about the Trump administration — which were called ""harsh"" and ""risqué.""

Knox said he had asked Chernow to speak as part of an effort to focus the event more on journalism itself. The WHCA has previously faced criticism of the event, including that it seems extravagant, excessively cozy with the White House and removed from its stated purpose of supporting scholarships, as Politico reports.

In his speech on Saturday night, Chernow narrated the history of journalists in the White House — touching on everything from how the press once shielded the private lives of presidents to Eleanor Roosevelt's role in elevating female correspondents — as he made a case for the free press and the First Amendment.

""Relations between presidents and the press are inevitably tough, almost always adversarial, but they don't need to be steeped in venom,"" he said.

Chernow also offered a defense of comedians, quoting comedian Will Rogers in saying that the United States has arrived at a point where ""people are taking their comedians seriously and their politicians as a joke."" In that spirit, he cracked more than a few jokes to varying degrees of success, the subjects of which included the Mueller report, Alexander Hamilton (""an immigrant who arrived, thank God, before the country was full"") and his own speech (a ""20-minute sedative"" for the evening).

Shortly before Chernow and Knox spoke about public mistrust of journalism and a tide of misinformation, a crowd at the president's rally in Wisconsin chanted ""CNN sucks"" as the president joked about the network.

""I'll tell you, you know what sucks? Their ratings suck,"" he said. ""Because people don't believe them.""

Trump spent much of the night promoting the U.S. economy and talking about ""unfair"" trade practices from countries like India and China. He pointed to the 3.2% annualized GDP growth in the first quarter that showed the economy gaining steam — and cited job gains in Wisconsin, a state that served as a tipping point in the 2016 presidential election.

He also discussed immigration and the detention of undocumented migrants, telling the crowd that ""illegal immigrants"" arriving at the border have placed ""a massive strain on communities and schools and hospitals and public resources, like nobody's ever seen before.""

At one point he brought press secretary Sarah Sanders on stage and showered her with praise. Sanders told the crowd she was proud to work for the president.

""Last year, this night, I was at a slightly different event, not quite the best welcome, so this is an amazing honor,"" she said, referring to her attendance at the 2018 WHCA dinner, where she was the subject of several of Wolf's controversial cracks.

Trump also took time at the start of his rally to offer condolences to the victims of Saturday's synagogue shooting near San Diego and to denounce anti-Semitism. ""Our entire nation mourns the loss of life, prays for the wounded and stands in solidarity with the Jewish community,"" he said."
Trump Accuses Saudis of Giving U.S. a Bad Deal. Is That True?,https://www.nytimes.com,['Ben Hubbard'],04-28-2019,2019,4,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/28/world/middleeast/trump-saudi-arabia-military.html,"BEIRUT, Lebanon — At a campaign rally in Green Bay, Wis., on Saturday, President Trump tore into Saudi Arabia, an important Middle Eastern ally, as yet another country giving the United States a bad deal.

He said that although the kingdom had spent $450 billion in the United States, Washington was still “subsidizing” the Saudi military. Mr. Trump said during the rally that he had complained about that to the Saudi monarch, King Salman, in a phone call.

“King!” Mr. Trump said he told the monarch. Using an expletive, he said, he griped that the United States was losing its shirt defending Saudi Arabia, “and you have a lot of money.”

It is highly unlikely that the call took place as Mr. Trump described, but in any case, the president appears to have mischaracterized the relationship between the United States and Saudi Arabia.

House Democrats Feel Little Pressure From Voters to Impeach Trump,https://www.nytimes.com,"['Nicholas Fandos', 'Catie Edmondson', 'Sheryl Gay Stolberg']",04-28-2019,2019,4,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/28/us/politics/house-democrats-impeachment.html,"A Washington Post-ABC News poll released on Friday appeared to underscore Democrats’ dilemma. It found that roughly six in 10 Democrats supported beginning impeachment proceedings against Mr. Trump, most of them strongly. But almost nine in 10 Republicans and six in 10 independents, whom Democrats need to defeat Mr. Trump, opposed the idea.

Democratic leaders in the House have pledged a series of hearings intended to ferret out the details of Mr. Mueller’s investigation and air the testimony of key witnesses. Rather than jump to conclusions — and there are some liberal lawmakers arguing in favor of prompt impeachment — party leaders say they want to build a case on live television before the public and see where that leads.

“We are going to do our work, but we’re not going to do it haphazardly,” Representative James E. Clyburn of South Carolina, the No. 3 Democrat in the House, said Sunday on the ABC program “This Week.”

He added, “Timing is everything in this business, and it’s one thing to run down a road toward impeachment; it’s something else to lay a foundation, gather the facts, educate the American people to see what needs to be done and when we should do it.”

For now, at least, the lack of pressure in districts that helped deliver Democrats their majority and united Republican support for Mr. Trump could help shape the road forward. Impeachment, Speaker Nancy Pelosi said last week at a Time magazine event, is “one of the most divisive paths we could go down in our country, but if the path of fact-finding takes us there, we have no choice.”

It is not that Democratic voters are counseling kindness. In Flava’s in Miami, the iconic restaurant’s owner, Wilbur Bell, agonized to Ms. Mucarsel-Powell that House Democrats were standing idly by while the president “disrespects their summons and subpoenas.”"

I do think Washington, D.C., is much too obsessed by the finger and should look at the crisis” revealed by the 2016 election.

He said that he pointed out to Democrats in the whiny wake of that election that their own statistics should have shown them that many Americans felt economically shaky.

“I do think the genius — and I’m using the word genius — of Donald Trump is to have felt the crisis,” he said.

Araud noted that Republicans are now “Trumpified.”

“You had a Republican Party that was really free trade, interventionist in foreign policy, connected to budgetary restraint,” he said. “And suddenly you have a Republican Party that is shifting to protectionism, nationalism, defense of the identity. Exactly the same thing is happening to conservative parties across the Western democracies. Social democracy is in a coma in Europe, so I do think the elections in 2020 will be totally fascinating in America because the Democratic Party will be obliged to answer the question, ‘What does it mean to be on the left in America?’”

Like Democrats in 2016, Emmanuel Macron underestimated the resentment bubbling under the surface, he said: “He has been largely elected by the included against the excluded. And he has not been able to widen his appeal beyond basically the people who feel comfortable in a global world.”"
DOJ warns Nadler that Barr won't stand for protracted hearing,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],04-28-2019,2019,4,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/doj-warns-nadler-that-barr-wont-stand-for-protracted-hearing-report,"Attorney General William Barr is reportedly threatening to pull out of a hearing before the House Judiciary Committee this week.

A committee source told CNN that Barr objects to the format planned for Thursday's hearing, which is focused on special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.

Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., wants two rounds of questions, one for members and a second in which each counsel for the Democratic Party and Republican Party would have the opportunity to ask questions. He also proposed a closed session to discuss redacted sections in Mueller's report.

Barr objects to the added sessions and the closed session. The Justice Department has signaled that Barr may not show up unless Nadler backs off.

""Discussions are still ongoing, to be picked back up tomorrow,"" a Justice Department official told the Washington Examiner. ""Our position is that it’s a congressional hearing, therefore members do the questioning.""

Nadler told CNN that Barr would not ""dictate the format of the Judiciary Committee.""

Barr is also scheduled to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday, which is still expected to happen."
New EPA document tells communities to brace for climate change impacts,https://www.houstonchronicle.com,"['Juliet Eilperin', 'Brady Dennis', 'The Washington Post', 'Amber Elliott', 'Staff Writer', 'Joseph Duarte', 'Zoya Khan', 'Ana Khan']",04-27-2019,2019,4,https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/science-environment/article/New-EPA-document-tells-communities-to-brace-for-13801870.php,"The Environmental Protection Agency published a 150-page document this past week with a straightforward message for coping with the fallout from natural disasters across the country: Start planning for the fact that climate change is going to make these catastrophes worse.

The language, included in guidance on how to address the debris left in the wake of floods, hurricanes and wildfires, is at odds with the rhetoric of the EPA's own leader, Andrew Wheeler. Just last month, Wheeler said in an interview with CBS that ""most of the threats from climate change are 50 to 75 years out.""

Multiple recent studies have identified how climate change is already affecting the United States and the globe. In the western United States, for example, regional temperatures have increased by almost 2 degrees Fahrenheit since the 1970s, and snowmelt is occurring a month earlier in areas, extending the fire season by three months and quintupling the number of large fires. Another scientific paper, co-authored by EPA researchers, found that unless the United States slashes carbon emissions, climate change will probably cost the United States hundreds of billions of dollars annually by 2100.

The divergence between Wheeler and his own agency offers the latest example of the often contradictory way that federal climate policy has evolved under President Donald Trump. As the White House has sought to minimize or ignore climate science, government experts have continued to sound the alarm.

The president has said he intends to withdraw the nation from a key international climate accord, but last fall 13 agencies issued a report concluding that ""the evidence of human-caused climate change is overwhelming and continues to strengthen, that the impacts of climate change are intensifying across the country, and that climate-related threats to Americans' physical, social, and economic well-being are rising.""

The White House has repeatedly sought ways to question the broad scientific consensus that human activities are driving climate change, and it is considering creating a federal advisory panel to reexamine those findings. But while the National Security Council is still pursuing the task force proposal, it has encountered resistance from military and intelligence officials as well as the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy.

[To fix global warming, the world needs Houston]

Even some of the administration's symbolic efforts to change the government's climate message have fizzled. In the summer of 2017, top EPA officials had plans to tweak references to climate change in the agency's official museum, and possibly to put a piece of coal on display. The overhaul plans stalled and are now not expected to materialize, according to two individuals who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.

Still, Trump officials often home in on references to climate change in key documents.

In the case of April 24 guidance from the EPA's Office of Land and Emergency Management, documents show, the White House's Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs sought to downplay climate change's impact on the intensity of natural disasters. But these efforts, first reported by E&E News, did not entirely remove those references.

The document published Wednesday in the Federal Register repeatedly makes the link between climate change and more-severe floods, wildfires and storms.

While the White House struck one phrase attributing extreme weather events to climate change, the document still refers to ""climate change"" and ""a changing climate"" 22 times.

""According to the 2014 National Climate Assessment, which is a detailed report on climate change impacts on the U.S., climate change is expected to increase the frequency and intensity of some natural disasters,"" it states. ""The amount of debris generated by natural disasters, and the costs to manage it, will likely increase as a result.""

The guidance is directed toward ""communities at increased risk from natural disasters due to climate change,"" according to the document, which included a section titled ""Incorporate Climate Change Adaptation into Debris Management Planning.""

Asked about the document Friday, the EPA declined to comment.

""This EPA guidance is clearly telling the public you need to start dealing now with disasters that are being made worse by climate change and will be made even worse due to climate change,"" said Amit Narang, regulatory policy advocate at the group Public Citizen. ""It's pretty troubling to me to see the head of EPA saying the exact opposite thing.""

To some extent, the new document reflects the advances scientists have made attributing extreme events to climate change since a landmark analysis was published in 2004 looking at a deadly European heat wave the year before.

The U.S. government's main climate change website, climate.gov, features a detailed explanation of how the science has evolved in recent years, including how federal researchers have contributed to the field.

""Scientists are increasingly able to distinguish evidence of human-induced climate change from natural variability,"" according to the government explainer.

But the research into extreme event attribution is hardly limited to the government. Since 2011, the American Meteorological Society has compiled an annual assessment of how human-caused climate change probably affected the strength and frequency of extreme events such as record heat waves, droughts and wildfires.

The group has said that of the more than 130 peer-reviewed studies published as part of the annual reviews, about 65% have identified the fingerprints of climate change in extreme weather events, while about 35% found no clear connection.

""The science has really developed in the last decade, in particular, around the influence of global warming on extreme events,"" said Noah Diffenbaugh, a professor and senior fellow at Stanford University who studies the climate system.

For starters, he said, researchers are constantly gathering more data and studying more weather events, so that the observational record has grown over time. Computing power and modeling capabilities have improved. And there also has been an ""explosion of research"" on the topic, as scientists have developed frameworks for better evaluating the role of climate change in specific events.

The result, he said, is a growing body of research that details how human-caused climate change is contributing to record heat, more-intense storms, more-severe flooding and other events.

""It's very clear from multiple lines of evidence that we are already being impacted by the global warming that's already happened,"" Diffenbaugh said.

During Wheeler's confirmation hearing early this year, Democrats repeatedly tried to pin down Wheeler, who has lobbied in the past for the fossil fuel industry, about exactly where he stands on climate change and the risks it poses.

Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., pressed Wheeler about whether he agreed with Trump's comment that climate change amounted to a Chinese ""hoax."" After being pressed, the acting administrator replied, ""I have not used the 'hoax' word myself.""

Sanders then asked Wheeler whether he accepts the consensus of most scientists that climate change is one of the most serious problems facing the nation. ""I would not call it the greatest crisis, no, sir,"" he replied. ""I would call it a huge issue that needs to be addressed globally."""
Is the Trump Justice Department trying to sabotage the First Step Act?,https://www.salon.com,[],04-28-2019,2019,4,https://www.salon.com/2019/04/28/is-the-trump-justice-department-trying-to-sabotage-the-first-step-act_partner/,"House Judiciary Committee Democrats are raising the alarm over a move by the Justice Department that would give a conservative think tank opposed to criminal justice reforms a key role in implementing the First Step Act. That bill, signed into law by President Trump in December, combines limited sentencing reforms with measures designed to allow current inmates to shorten their sentences by participating in evidence-based training programs.

But despite the president’s support for the measure, the Trump Justice Department has taken a step that appears aimed at undercutting the act. Earlier this month, the DOJ’s National Institute of Justice announced that it had selected the Hudson Institute to host the Independent Review Committee (IRC) mandated under the act.

In a joint statement released Tuesday, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-NY., and Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism and Homeland Security Chairwoman Karen Bass, D-CA., sharply questioned the decision. “Our concerns about this decision remain” even after staff was briefed by DOJ, the pair said.

Under the act, the IRC’s function is to create independent, unbiased oversight of the law’s implementation and to ensure that reforms are carried out in a bipartisan and evidence-based manner. The act calls on the National Institute of Justice to “select a nonpartisan and nonprofit organization with expertise in the study and development of risk and needs assessment tools.”

The Hudson Institute doesn’t fit that description. A bastion of neo-conservative thought, the institute was founded in 1961 by uber-Cold Warrior Herman Kahn, whose quest for “winnable” nuclear war strategies inspired Stanly Kubrick’s ""Dr. Strangelove."" Its primary interests are advancing militaristic security policies and a pro-Israel and Islamophobic agenda in the Middle East, although it offers up neo-conservative critiques of domestic social and economic issues as well.

“The Hudson Institute appears to have little or no expertise in the study and development of risk and needs assessment tools,” Nadler and Bass wrote.

That opinion was seconded by Marc Mauer, executive director of the Sentencing Project, a Washington, D.C.-based non-profit dedicated to working for a fair and effective U.S. criminal justice system.

“The Hudson Institute has no interest or expertise in criminal justice policy, and to the extent they do have any opinion about policy, they’re very hostile to the kinds of provisions that are in the First Step Act,” Mauer said. “It’s a strange choice when there are so many other reputable think tanks and organizations that do have experience in these issues.”

Hudson’s chief operating officer is George W. Bush-era drug czar John Walters, which raised another red flag for Mauer: “Walters is one of the premier drug warriors of the past 20 years,” he said. “He’s the co-author, with John Dilulio, of Body Count, that book from the 1990s that spread the thoroughly discredited ‘superpredators’ myth.”

In their statement, Nadler and Bass noted that DOJ was not forthcoming when queried about why Hudson was chosen and suggested that perhaps the decision has come through other-than-conventional channels.

“Committee staff questioned DOJ representatives charged with overseeing First Step Act implementation as to why the Hudson Institute was selected and were told that DOJ representatives did not know,” they explained. “Staff asked whether the Hudson Institute has ever studied or developed a risk and needs assessment tool and were told that DOJ representatives did not know. Staff asked on what date the Hudson Institute was selected and were told that DOJ representatives did not know. Staff asked what process was used to select the Hudson Institute, and again were told that DOJ representatives did not know.”

But Nadler and Bass already knew a few things about the institute itself.

“The Hudson Institute and its leadership have opposed sentencing reform, opposed the First Step Act’s reforms, and authored an article entitled ‘Why Trump Should Oppose Criminal Justice Reform,’” they noted. “We are concerned that the selection of a biased organization lacking requisite expertise may reflect a lack of intent to diligently and effectively implement the bipartisan criminal justice reforms passed last Congress.”

“DOJ is either paying short shrift to implementing critical elements of the First Step Act or substituting its own perspective over the will of Congress,” they added. “We ask that NIJ immediately rescind this selection and appoint an organization that comports with the mandates under the First Step Act. Congress will remain vigilant and demands that DOJ carry out the letter and spirit of the First Step Act.”

Does President Trump know that somewhere in the Justice Department his minions are working to undercut the bill he signed? Does he care?"
The Complicated Friendship of Robert Mueller and William Barr,https://www.theatlantic.com,['Russell Berman'],04-28-2019,2019,4,https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/04/mueller-barr-and-their-pre-trump-friendship/588151/,"Mueller did not attend, and the attorney general said he didn’t talk to Mueller about his decision to clear Trump of obstruction. “That’s not two friends collaborating collegially on a project,” said Frank Figliuzzi, a former counterintelligence chief at the FBI who briefed Mueller twice a day during their tenure together. “It’s almost worse than undercutting Mueller. It’s saying Mueller’s not even relevant in this.”

David A. Graham: What if everything Mueller told us had been new?

In a phone interview, Figliuzzi described the dynamic between Mueller and Barr as one of “a boy scout” (Mueller) versus “a street fighter” (Barr). The attorney general himself has acknowledged that he and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein “disagreed with some of the special counsel’s legal theories.” Now it is up to Congress to sort through the conflicts and to determine the legacy of the investigation they each had a hand in steering. “Mueller is a guy who plays by the rules, and he was playing by the rules in this report,” Figliuzzi told me. “He kind of trusts that the system will take care of itself, and he kicks his report over across the street to DOJ. That’s where things go south.”

It was Barr who first brought up his decades-long friendship with the man whose investigation he was to oversee, whose conclusions he was to summarize, and whose report he was to present to Congress and the American public. “I have known Bob Mueller personally and professionally for 30 years,” he told the Senate Judiciary Committee in January. “We worked closely together throughout my previous tenure at the Department of Justice under President Bush. We’ve been friends since.”

When Barr served as attorney general under President George H. W. Bush in 1991 and 1992, Mueller was the assistant attorney general heading up the criminal division. Both Barr and Mueller were in their 40s at the time, and colleagues from that period describe them as exceptionally smart and well-prepared lawyers who shared an easy rapport with each other, as well as a reverence for the Department of Justice. “Bob has always had this real strong desire to see the rule of law vindicated. That’s where the two of them are two peas in a pod,” said Paul McNulty, who served as the department’s chief spokesman in the early 1990s and later oversaw Mueller as deputy attorney general in the George W. Bush administration.

Barr and Mueller would sit in daily morning meetings in which Barr would often rib the more straitlaced Mueller about cases. “They got along very well,” recalled Timothy Flanigan, who was then an assistant attorney general overseeing the Office of Legal Counsel. “Bill had a keener sense of humor than Bob. He’d poked fun at Bob, and Bob took it in good grace.”

Mueller, a Marine who became a prosecutor, and Barr, who had worked in policy jobs during the Reagan and Bush administrations, were aligned on the tough-on-crime priorities that were in vogue in the early 1990s. Separately, former colleagues described each of them as the kind of boss who doesn’t “suffer fools.” But they had different strengths and different personalities. “One’s a soldier, one was essentially an intellectual, legal heavyweight,” McNulty told me. While Barr was known as a quick thinker who thought through arguments and made decisions rapidly, Mueller was more deliberative and process-oriented. “Mueller could be more down in the weeds,” McNulty said, “and Barr was more up above the weeds, looking at the constitutional issue, the big legal issue."
State Department urges US citizens to leave Sri Lanka,https://thehill.com,[],04-27-2019,2019,4,https://thehill.com/policy/international/asia-pacific/440954-state-department-urges-us-citizens-to-leave-sri-lanka,"The State Department issued new guidance Friday urging U.S. citizens to leave Sri Lanka in the wake of a terrorist attack on Easter on churches and luxury hotels that killed more than 250 people.

The message, which urged the voluntary departure of all U.S. citizens from the country, also ordered that all school-age family members of U.S. government employees leave Sri Lanka.

""Terrorist groups continue plotting possible attacks in Sri Lanka. Terrorists may attack with little or no warning, targeting tourist locations, transportation hubs, markets, shopping malls, government facilities, hotels, clubs, restaurants, places of worship, parks, major sporting and cultural events, educational institutions, airports, hospitals, and other public areas,"" the State Department said on its website.

The guidance came the same day a Sri Lankan raid on a suspected militant hideout killed at least 15 people.

The raid on the country’s eastern coast followed a shootout nearby, after which authorities found explosives, detonators, “suicide kits,” military uniforms and ISIS flags.

ISIS has claimed responsibility for the attack, though local extremist group National Thowheed Jamath (NTJ) has been blamed for Sunday's bombings.

Catholic leaders on Friday morning also announced that Sunday Masses across Sri Lanka would be canceled indefinitely as the country grapples with the ongoing security threat.

Hamilton biographer gives WHCD speech on history of contentious relationship between press and presidents,https://thehill.com,[],04-27-2019,2019,4,https://thehill.com/blogs/in-the-know/in-the-know/441011-hamilton-biographer-gives-whcd-speech-on-history-of-contentious,"Alexander Hamilton biographer Ron Chernow gave a speech about the historical relationship between presidents and the press, which he characterized as “almost always adversarial” but not “steeped in venom” at the White House Correspondents’ Dinner (WHCD) Saturday night.

Chernow spoke in place of a comedian that typically headlines the event following a provocative performance last year by Michelle Wolf. The historian sprinkled in a few jokes and finished with some Mark Twain quotes, but stuck largely to a discussion of history and press freedom.

He opened his speech by acknowledging his difference from past speakers.

“I confess that I was surprised when I received the invitation to speak here tonight, I mean I knew they weren’t approaching me as an international sex symbol, right?”

“Then [White House Correspondents’ Association President] Olivier [Knox] told me that they wanted to try boring at this year’s dinner and I said ‘oh I can deliver on that big time,’” he said.

In the speech where he discussed moments of varying fondness between reporters and presidents including George Washington, Richard Nixon, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan, Chernow noted that the Trump administration was a unique time to cover the White House.

“I think you’re doing noble work to preserve democracy at a time when a rising tide of misinformation masquerading as news threatens to make a mockery of the First Amendment,” he said.

“Donald J.

A New Obstruction Case Against a Judge Proves William Barr’s DOJ Is Now Just an Arm of President Donald Trump,https://slate.com,['Leah Litman'],04-26-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/obstruction-case-william-barr-doj-donald-trump.html,"Attorney General William Barr arrives for a press conference about the release of the Mueller report at the Department of Justice on April 18. Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images

It took Attorney General William Barr only one week from the release of the Mueller report to bring obstruction of justice charges against two governmental officials for interfering in a federal investigation. But the charges have nothing to do with the special counsel’s investigation into Russian interference in the election or the possible obstruction of that investigation.

Although the obstruction charges DOJ filed are not related to the Mueller report, they underscore just how far the attorney general bent over backward to spin the report in the president’s favor and how partisan the Department of Justice has become. The disparities between the two cases highlight how the Department of Justice, under Barr’s leadership, has become nothing more than a political arm of the Trump administration, particularly in its handling of possible obstruction charges stemming from the Mueller report.

The indictment against Judge Shelley Richmond Joseph, a Massachusetts district court judge, and Officer Wesley MacGregor, a Massachusetts trial court officer, alleges that the officers interfered with an Immigration and Customs Enforcement proceeding by preventing ICE from arresting an individual who was arrested on state charges and attended an arraignment hearing in state court. During the state court proceeding, Joseph asked an ICE officer to wait outside the courtroom while the court conducted the arraignment hearing. Earlier in the day, the judge had requested more information about one of the state charges in the case (a fugitive charge) after the prosecutor said the state would not seek to detain the defendant on the other charge (a drug charge).

Barr’s response to the obstruction issues raised by the Mueller report was partisan and unprincipled.

After recalling the case, the judge observed that ICE was in the courthouse. The prosecutor then informed the court that the state did not believe the defendant was the fugitive from Pennsylvania for whom there was an arrest warrant and therefore believed that the fugitive charge was an error, which would mean that the defendant would be free to leave. The defense attorney, however, noted that ICE was convinced otherwise and suggested they would likely take the client into custody. The defense attorney then suggested that “the best thing for us to do is to … release him … and hope that he can avoid ICE.”

At that point, the judge noted the other alternative was to recall the proceedings again the next day and asked “ICE is gonna get him?” before directing the clerk to go off the record. The recording was turned off for 52 seconds, and when it resumed, the prosecutor renewed the claim that the defendant was not the person with a Pennsylvania warrant out for his arrest and moved to dismiss the fugitive charge against him. Because the state had already stated it would not seek to detain the defendant on the drug charges, the defendant was released, and the trial court officer escorted him through the back door.

This evidence provided the basis for Barr’s Department of Justice to indict the state judge and state officer for obstruction of justice and conspiracy to obstruct justice. Yet all of the reasons Barr has previously cited for opposing an obstruction investigation against the president suggest the Department of Justice should not have brought obstruction charges against Joseph and MacGregor either.

For example, in June, Barr wrote a memo as a private citizen arguing that obstruction laws should not “reach facially-lawful actions taken by the President in exercising the discretion vested in him by the Constitution.” Yet that is exactly what the obstruction-of-justice charges against Joseph and MacGregor cover. State judges do not persist with criminal charges that the district attorney has dropped, and state law does not require judges to detain individuals on the drug charges that remained. It was therefore “facially legitimate” and within the “discretion” of the judge not to detain the individual based on the drug charge. The judge also has total control of her courtroom and can decide through which doors to instruct people to come and go. And the state judge’s motive shouldn’t matter to the analysis because under Barr’s theory of obstruction, government officials can’t be charged with obstruction “based solely on his subjective state of mind” for “simply exercising his discretion in a facially lawful way.”

Or take Barr’s statement—given at a bizarre press conference just prior to the release of the Mueller report last week—that the president did not corruptly intend to obstruct the investigation because the president “was frustrated and angered by a sincere belief that the investigation was undermining his presidency.” A similar exculpatory argument could be made on behalf of Joseph and MacGregor. They, too, may have been “frustrated and angered by a sincere belief that” ICE’s investigations and presence in state courthouses undermined the integrity of state court proceedings. Or perhaps they were frustrated and angered by a sincere belief that ICE’s enforcement efforts were the result of the president’s apparent bias and animosity toward the Latino community.

Ultimately, the Justice Department’s indictment of Joseph and MacGregor is a reminder about how aggressively the federal government often reads the federal obstruction statute. For example, the indictment confirms that obstruction does not have to be particularly sophisticated or successful in order to constitute a crime—the trial court officer merely let the defendant out the back door, and the defendant was subsequently apprehended and now faces deportation.

It also demonstrates a contrast in the kind of evidence that often suffices to establish an obstruction-of-justice charge. In the case of Joseph and MacGregor, DOJ has some snippets of a courtroom conversation that indicated the judge wanted to do something she did not want publicly recorded and less than a minute without a recording. In the case of President Donald Trump and his associates, special counsel Robert Mueller compiled dozens of witnesses, contemporaneous notes, 10 separate incidents, 182 pages of a report, multiple instances of officials lying to investigators or not being forthcoming with them, and several damning instances of the president lying in an apparent effort to cover his tracks. All of this led Barr to his four-page summary conclusion that Trump had not committed a crime—a conclusion that flew in the face of Mueller’s findings.

The stark difference between the attorney general’s treatment of the obstruction case against Joseph and MacGregor and the obstruction cases at the heart of the Mueller report serves as a pointed reminder that Barr’s response to the obstruction issues raised by the Mueller report was partisan and unprincipled."
"Father, two brothers of suspected Sri Lanka bombings mastermind killed in gun battle",https://www.reuters.com,"['Alasdair Pal', 'Min Read']",04-28-2019,2019,4,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-sri-lanka-blasts-bomber/father-two-brothers-of-sri-lanka-suicide-bombings-mastermind-killed-in-gun-battle-idUSKCN1S405L,"KALMUNAI/COLOMBO (Reuters) - The father and two brothers of the suspected mastermind of Sri Lanka’s Easter Sunday bombings were killed when security forces stormed their safe house on the east coast two days ago, police and a relative said on Sunday.

Zainee Hashim, Rilwan Hashim and their father Mohamed Hashim, who appear in a video circulating on social media calling for all-out war against non-believers, were among at least 15 killed in a fierce gun battle with the military on the east coast on Friday.

Kamal Jayanathdhi, the officer in charge at Kalmunai police station on the east coast, confirmed the three men had died along with a child that appears in the video, and that the undated clip in which they discuss martyrdom, had been shot in the same house where the gun battle took place.

Two people who were inside the house, a woman and a seven-year-old girl believed to be relatives of the men, survived, he said, while a woman was killed in crossfire on a nearby street.

Niyaz Sharif, the brother-in-law of Zahran Hashim, the suspected ringleader of the wave of Easter Sunday bombings that killed over 250 people in churches and hotels across the island nation, told Reuters the video showed Zahran’s two brothers and father.

Sri Lanka has been on high alert since the attacks on Easter Sunday, with nearly 10,000 soldiers deployed across the island to carry out searches and hunt down members of two local Islamist groups believed to have carried out the attack.

Authorities have detained more than 100 people, including foreigners from Syria and Egypt since the April 21 bombings.

On Sunday police in the eastern town of Kattankudy raided a mosque founded by Zahran which doubled up as the headquarters of his group, the National Thawheedh Jamaath (NTJ).

HOLY WAR

In the video, Rilwan Hashim is seen calling for ‘jihad’ or holy war, while children cry in the background.

“We will destroy these non-believers to protect this land and therefore we need to do jihad,” Rilwan says in the video, sitting beside his brother and father.

“We need to teach a proper lesson for these non-believers who have been destroying Muslims.”

Rilwan, who has a damaged eye and badly disfigured hand in the video, had recently been injured while making a bomb, Jayanathdhi said.

On Sunday, when Reuters visited the house, police were sifting through the wreckage, taking fingerprints and video footage.

Watermelon rinds and a box of dates were still on the kitchen counter, while four pairs of children’s flip-flops were by the front door.

But in the main room, where the three men filmed the video, a huge crater had punched a hole in the concrete floor, while bloodstains covered the wall.

LOCAL VIGILANCE

Two men had moved into the three-room rented house in the Sainthamaruthu area of Kalmunai, days before the Easter Sunday attacks, police and locals said. After more people arrived, locals grew suspicious, said Mohammed Majid, the secretary of the Grand Masjid Sainthamaruthu, one of the town’s main mosques.

After evening prayers on Friday, a group of men from the local Hijra Mosque came to the house to question the occupants.

When one man brandished an assault rifle, the men fled, alerting police who arrived shortly afterwards. One man was killed after running into the street with a gun to confront police, while a series of explosions came from the house, eyewitnesses said.

DANGER REMAINS

Authorities suspect there may be more suicide bombers on the loose. Defence authorities have so far focused their investigations on international links to two domestic groups they believe carried out the attacks, the National Thawheedh Jamaath and Jammiyathul Millathu Ibrahim.

At a nearby house where police seized more explosives and a flag of the Islamic State on Friday, locals said they feared more violence.

“People were coming and going but we didn’t know their names,” said Juneedha Hasanar, who runs a shop at the bottom of the street, yards from the house. “Now we are afraid.”

Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the Easter bombings, and on Sunday the group said three of its members clashed with Sri Lankan police for several hours in Friday’s gun battle on the east coast before detonating their explosive vests, the militant group’s news agency Amaq said.

The group said 17 policemen were killed or injured in the attack, but the Sri Lankan military has denied this. A police source told Reuters two policemen were slightly injured in the battle.

Police have said six children were among the other 12 people who died in the gun battle, and on Sunday recovered the partial remains of a child no more than a few months old."
E.P.A. Proposes Weaker Standards on Chemicals Contaminating Drinking Water,https://www.nytimes.com,"['Eric Lipton', 'Julie Turkewitz']",04-25-2019,2019,4,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/25/us/epa-chemical-standards-water.html,"WASHINGTON — After pressure from the Defense Department, the Environmental Protection Agency significantly weakened a proposed standard for cleaning up groundwater pollution caused by toxic chemicals that contaminate drinking water consumed by millions of Americans and that have been commonly used at military bases.

Standards released by the agency on Thursday eliminated entirely a section that would have addressed how it would respond to what it has described as “immediate threats posed by hazardous waste sites.” Those short-term responses, known as removal actions, can include excavating contaminated soil or building a security fence around a toxic area.

Exposure to the class of toxic chemicals, called per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances, has been linked in recent years to kidney cancer, testicular cancer, thyroid disease, high cholesterol and ulcerative colitis, among other diseases. Animal studies also show delays in development.

For decades, the substances, more commonly known as PFAS, have been placed in all kinds of everyday products — nonstick pans, clothing, furniture. They can also be found in firefighting foams used on military bases, on airfields and by municipal firefighters."
We’re not hearing enough from 2020 candidates about things they’d be able to do as president,https://www.vox.com,['Apr'],04-26-2019,2019,4,https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/4/26/18512479/2020-primary-campaign-policy-ideas,"This week’s presidential town halls displayed the full range of Democratic Party thinking on the role of policy in a presidential campaign.

Elizabeth Warren has a vast stack of detailed specifics. Pete Buttigieg had an explicit defense of not having detailed policies. And Bernie Sanders elevated every specific discussion to the realm of abstract morality. It all revealed that Democrats not only have a range of ideas but a range of different ideas about the nature and value of ideas.

What we didn’t get much of, unfortunately, was discussion of the kind of policy ideas that really matter — an understanding of what potential presidents would do with the actual powers of office that the president possesses. The American constitutional system is, after all, a rather complicated and nuanced web of interlocking and partially overlapping spheres of authority.

The president’s powers, while vast and larger than those of any other single actor in the system, are in their way fairly limited. And in particular, the president’s powers don’t include the ability to unilaterally enact the kind of sweeping legislative change that often dominates what passes for policy discussion in the 2020 campaign.

Presidents influence legislation, of course, and hearing their opinions about legislative ideals can be an informative exercise about priorities and values. But we shouldn’t let this kind of discussion completely crowd out the basic reality that a president has specific powers — executive branch appointments, foreign policy, judicial appointments, and regulatory discretion — and it would be good to hear how wannabe presidents plan to use them.

Kamala Harris talks about policy the right way

The partial exception to this trend is Kamala Harris, who repeatedly got asked the same kinds of questions as everyone else but who answered with replies that are more attentive to the actual modalities of political authority.

Asked by a student whether we should legalize sex work, for example, Harris offered an answer about what she’d actually done as a district attorney.

My background, as you know, I was a prosecutor. When I was district attorney of San Francisco I instituted a number of policies that were focused on women and children and how they were treated frankly with bias in the criminal justice system where they were criminalized without really looking at the real offender and so often that case was the pimps and johns, so women were arrested as being prostitutes. I created policies saying we need to focus on the other folks and not just on the women. I was responsible for an initiative in San Francisco that was about recognizing that girls who are being trafficked were being called teenage prostitutes when, in fact, they were the victims of an incredible amount of abuse and had been trafficked. And so I created a whole policy in San Francisco that was, one, intended to stop calling them teenage prostitutes, but instead to call them sexually exploited youth. And because of the work that we did we then created a safe house for these young women so that instead of them being arrested and put in juvenile hall they would be in a safe house. And then we were responsible for actually getting legislation passed that said that when those johns and pimps are prosecuted they should be prosecuted in connection with the sale of a child, again looking at what we need to do to figure out who’s doing what.

Harris simply declines to say what she thinks an optimal legislative framework for regulating (or not) sex work would be. The district attorney of San Francisco has an important role in the operation of law enforcement in the city, but the role does not include the ability to unilaterally rewrite criminal statutes. She instead talks about what policy changes she made that were in the scope of her authority as DA and explicates at least some of her larger perspective on the issue — namely that the burden of enforcement should not fall on the sex workers themselves.

I don’t know anything about this issue and don’t really know if that’s a smart perspective, but it’s a smart kind of answer, because Harris is talking about how the practice of policymaking works. Specific people with specific authority do specific things. And while the president certainly has some ability to shape legislation and set the congressional agenda, fundamentally the main powers of office are elsewhere. The president vetoes bills, appoints judges, and runs the executive branch.

Later, asked a fairly vague question about gun control, she responded in a similar spirit, saying she favored new legislation but then detailing a specific course of action that she would take as president.

Upon being elected I will give the United States Congress 100 days to get their act together and have the courage to pass reasonable gun safety laws. And if they fail to do it, then I will take executive action. And specifically what I will do is put in place a requirement that for anyone who sells more than five guns a year they are required to do background checks when they sell those guns. I will require that for any gun dealer that breaks the law the ATF take their license. And by the way, ATF — Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms — they’ve been doing a lot of “A” and “T,” but not much of the “F.” We need to fix that. And then on the third piece, because none of us have been sleeping the last two years, part of what’s happened under the current administration is they take fugitives off the list of prohibited people. I put them back on the list, meaning that fugitives from justice should not be able to purchase a handgun or any kind of weapon. So that’s what I’d do.

There are some questions about whether a Harris administration could, in fact, really put this kind of regulatory mandate in place. But evidently Harris and her team think she could — or, at a minimum, they’d like to try it and see what happens in court. Either way, this was one of the most informative answers anyone has given at any 2020 town hall because it referred to something Harris could actually do if she became president.

We get too many irrelevant questions

Across the five-candidate event, however, almost no questions were directed at those areas actually under the president’s control. Instead, CNN hosts asked a variety of contenders whether they think felons currently serving jail time should be allowed to vote. Sanders said yes, Buttigieg said no, Harris initially seemed open to it and then backtracked.

This is a moderately interesting question of abstract political philosophy, but it’s a state-level issue that the president has no control over.

Meanwhile, essentially every candidate appearance these days ends up spending a fair amount of time on candidates’ utopian visions for health care policy. Sanders, famously, supports moving to a Canadian-style system in which everyone would have a government insurance plan and competing private offerings would be barred. Most other Democrats seem less sure.

This is a fine topic to talk about, but realistically the odds of a Sanders-style bill (or anything like it) passing are minimal. It might be more interesting to hear whether Sanders (or any other candidate) is so hard-line that he’d actually refuse to sign some more incremental legislation. Presidents, after all, have a fair amount of agenda-setting power, but they don’t actually write bills on health care or anything else. What they do is veto bills.

But the vast majority of questions completely ignore these institutional realities. Buttigieg even veered off into talking about constitutional amendments at one point, a process over which the president has no authority whatsoever.

Citizens interested in trying to understand how an Elizabeth Warren presidency might differ from an Amy Klobuchar presidency can get at least some sense from the fact that Warren has put her name behind a huge number of ambitious legislative proposals and Klobuchar hasn’t. But in concrete terms, it might be more informative to ask them about the things the president specifically does.

Presidents have a lot of specific powers

Donald Trump has done a lot of things as president.

Some of that has been signing legislation (a tax cut, a couple of appropriations deals, a bipartisan criminal justice reform overhaul). But legislation really only emerges in one of two ways. You have partisan bills like the Trump tax cut that leadership in Congress crafts and then negotiates with the most moderate members to pass, and you have bipartisan bills that are written by groups in Congress working across the aisle.

The White House can and does alter the course of this process around the margins — and certainly the White House can blow up a potential compromise by coming out in opposition — but the president simply can’t define the frontiers of the possible.

What Trump has done instead is appoint a lot of pro-business people to head regulatory agencies, and made it clear to them that he wants them to proceed in a maximally aggressive way with regard to how much deregulation it is legally possible to get away with.

Any Democrat will tilt in the opposite direction, but the parties are not mirror images of each other, and it would be unusual for a Democratic administration to choose a program of maximum regulatory aggression on every front. So the question of what particular areas a given president thinks it’s wise to regulate harshly on is very interesting and significant.

The next president almost certainly won’t rewrite antitrust law. But she will appoint a head of the Justice Department’s antitrust division and a head of the Federal Trade Commission. Those agencies’ activities will be bounded by the courts, but she’ll appoint judges too.

On immigration, too, almost everything Trump has done has been through the use of discretionary presidential power. President Obama also made use of discretionary authority, first to establish DACA and then later in a more sweeping effort that ended up in court. Continuing the pursuit of some kind of comprehensive legislative deal is a no-brainer, but from day one the next president will face a series of urgent questions about how to use executive discretion over immigration policy.

Beyond appointments and regulatory policy, the other really big thing the president does is foreign policy. Some of that involves military deployments, some of it is more diplomatic in nature, and, as Trump has dramatized a fair amount, some of it involves the president’s discretionary authority over various aspects of tariff policy. The foreign and national security domain is where the president faces the fewest institutional constraints, but it’s been almost entirely absent from the 2020 primary thus far.

Policy is important, but we should focus on the important part

At the end of the day, the kind of policy proposals that Warren has been making — or the vaguer ones from Sanders — don’t actually amount to anything that’s very different from Buttigieg’s statements of values or Beto standing on tables. And values, to be clear, are important. Sanders’s decades-long support for implementing a Canadian-style health care system in the United States tells us something important about him.

What it doesn’t tell us, however, is what is likely to actually happen with health policy under a Sanders administration. And that’s a topic people have good reason to be interested in.

To get at that, you’d need to ask presidential candidates about the things that are actually under the White House’s control: appointments at the Department of Health and Human Services and the FDA, the regulatory process, Medicaid waivers, and so on. That’s all a little bit less exciting than sweeping visions of human betterment.

But the whole reason politics matters is because the political process drives policy outcomes. And the specific way in which presidential politics drives policy outcomes is that presidents exercise their constitutional powers of office. The American people deserve to hear more about how the candidates plan to do that."
DOJ Inspector General Probe of Carter Page Warrants Update,https://www.nationalreview.com,"['Eric Felten', 'David French', 'Jack Crowe', 'Dennis Prager', 'Jason Richwine', 'Jonah Goldberg', 'Read More', 'The Week', 'The American Conservative', 'The Wall Street Journal']",04-26-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/in-going-after-carter-page-did-the-fbi-and-doj-abuse-the-fisa-process/,"Department of Justice Inspector General Michael Horowitz before testifying on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., June 19, 2018 (Joshua Roberts/Reuters)

The DOJ inspector general is on the case, and there are signs he’ll be tough on the agencies.

Department of Justice inspector general Michael Horowitz announced in March 2018 that his office was reviewing the DOJ’s and FBI’s “compliance with legal requirements, and with applicable DOJ and FBI policies and procedures, in applications filed with the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) relating to a certain U.S. person.” In other words, he was asking whether the agencies abused their power in getting warrants to surveil (by then, former) Trump-campaign foreign-policy adviser Carter Page.

More than a year later, we still don’t know much about the course of the IG’s investigation. But that may finally be changing.

Horowitz has one of the best-caulked tubs in town: His team doesn’t leak. But that’s not the only reason info on the Horowitz investigation has been so hard to come by. In addition, his job doesn’t entail bringing revealing indictments along the way.

Robert Mueller’s shop wasn’t particularly leaky either, but long before the special counsel filed his final report, we had learned a lot about where that report was headed. We learned it from looking at who got indicted, what they were indicted for, and the many details in each indictment and descriptive “criminal information.” Those who were paying attention to the special counsel’s various prosecutions couldn’t help but notice that Paul Manafort was jailed for sundry financial improprieties and sheer tackiness (don’t forget the ostrich jacket), but not for conspiring with Russia. Similarly, when the special counsel’s office brought a raft of indictments against a group of Russian-military-intelligence hackers, missing was any knowing connection between team Trump and the accused. Indeed, so professional were the hacking operations described in Mueller’s indictment of the Russians that it is hard to imagine what the hackers could possibly have needed from the amateurs in Trump’s orbit. Such details led many to surmise that Mueller had yet to find collusion, deductions that proved correct.

No such intermediate actions have been taken by IG Horowitz, which has left us in the dark about what sort of report he is preparing. The IG is trying to establish how the counter-intelligence investigation into the Trump campaign got started. That much we know. What we haven’t had any idea about is just how tough Horowitz is willing to be with DOJ and FBI officials should he discover they abused their power.

There have been reasons to doubt he would be very tough. Recall how the IG’s report on the Hillary Clinton email investigation went out of its way to avoid damaging conclusions. Horowitz catalogued the compendious anti-Trump texts sent between FBI agent Peter Strzok and bureau lawyer Lisa Page, but he determined he could not prove their attitudes and opinions biased their official actions. Though “these messages cast a cloud” over the email investigation, Horowitz wrote, “we did not find documentary or testimonial evidence that improper considerations, including political bias, directly affected the specific investigative decisions we reviewed.” In other words, short of a memo from Strzok admitting his aversion to Trump was the reason for particular actions, Horowitz was not willing to declare there had been political bias in play.

It may be different this time around. Natasha Bertrand is a reporter with extensive sources among the cadres of senior DOJ and FBI elites who have been fired, been demoted, or retired in the last couple of years. These are the very people who are the objects of the IG’s efforts, and they don’t like where things are headed.

“Former U.S. officials interviewed by the inspector general were skeptical about the quality of his probe,” Bertrand wrote in Politico last week. “They emphasized to Horowitz that information in a warrant application need not be wholly verified, as long as the reliability of the source of the information is disclosed to the court.” Democrats have insisted that the FISA court was given fair warning that Christopher Steele’s dossier was opposition research; Republicans have scoffed at the way Steele working for the Clinton campaign was described: “The FBI speculates that the identified U.S. person [Steele] was likely looking for information that could be used to discredit Candidate #1’s [Donald Trump’s] campaign.” Horowitz seems to have been unpersuaded that weasel words such as “speculates” and “likely looking” fulfilled the Justice Department’s obligations to the FISA court. Or as the unhappy former officials put it, “the inspector general seemed neither well-versed in the FISA process nor receptive to the explanations.”

Advertisement

Not only is the IG misinformed, according to Bertrand’s sources, he’s prickly. Consider this description of Horowitz’s frame of mind regarding demoted DOJ attorney Bruce Ohr: “The Inspector General is apparently irked by Ohr’s decision to maintain contact with Steele after the bureau temporarily cut ties with the British operative in October 2016.” Bertrand wrote. Not “concerned.” Not “disturbed.” Not “alarmed.” No, the IG is “irked,” a word that conveys an unprofessional personal pique.

Add up all this criticism — that the IG’s probe is of dubious “quality”; that Horowitz exposed his ignorance of the “FISA process”; that he is too hardheaded to listen to “explanations”; that the IG is prone to being “irked” — and what comes through isn’t a frustration with Horowitz’s failures, but fear of what he may do. Thus the need to discredit him preemptively.

That it hasn’t worked yet doesn’t mean the “former U.S. officials” won’t keep trying."
"DHS tells Army Corps to skirt land regs, begin $1B project to replace 53 miles of border fence",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],04-26-2019,2019,4,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/dhs-tells-army-corps-to-skirt-land-regs-begin-1b-project-to-replace-53-miles-of-border-fence,"The Department of Homeland Security issued two more waivers this week allowing the Army Corps of Engineers to bypass environmental laws and start a nearly $1 billion project to replace roughly 50 miles of border fence in parts of Arizona and Texas that are seeing high levels of illegal activity.

The department announced Friday the new construction projects will go up near El Paso, Texas, and Yuma, Ariz. Two weeks ago, the Army Corps awarded SLSCO $789 million for the El Paso project and Barnard Construction $187 million for the El Paso operation, a Federal Register entry states. The Pentagon is funding both projects.

President Trump campaigned in 2016 to build what he called a ""beautiful"" wall between the U.S. and Mexico. When he took office in January 2017, the barrier between both countries' 1,954-mile border covered approximately one-third of that space.

In the two years and three months that he has been in office, the Trump administration has completed less than 40 miles of barrier, the majority of which has been replacement.

Of the Border Patrol’s nine regions, the El Paso and Yuma border sectors affected by this week's DHS decisions have the second- and third-highest number of families illegally crossing the border, respectively.

El Paso will get 46 miles of steel bollard fence and Yuma will get seven miles of the same replacement fence in areas that have “dilapidated and outdated designs,” according to DHS. Both regions will also see new paved roads installed and improved lighting systems.

DHS justified waiving the environmental and land regulations on the basis that the projects were under authority given to a secretary in the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigration Responsibility Act of 1996. The IIRIRA states a secretary can waive all legal requirements if a barrier, road, or other infrastructure is immediately needed for national security purposes.

The waiver is the fourth such instance of DHS ploughing ahead with replacement and new wall projects since the fall, and the 12th time any secretary has cited the 1996 law in order to bypass others. The decision is expected to upset environmental groups, though DHS said it “remains committed to environmental stewardship.”

""DHS has been coordinating and consulting, and intends to continue doing so, with other federal and state resource agencies to ensure that impacts to the environment, wildlife, and cultural and historic artifacts are analyzed and minimized, to the greatest extent possible,” the department said in the announcement.

Last October, then-Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen waived regulations for 18 miles of barrier in the Rio Grande Valley of Texas and another project for 11 gates in the region.

Then in February, Nielsen skirted land regulations for 12 miles of a secondary barrier in San Diego, Calif.

The call for federal intervention comes after a tense City Council meeting this week that highlighted issues of policing, particularly within the city's minority community."
Should we shutter the Department of Education?,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],04-26-2019,2019,4,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/op-eds/should-we-shutter-the-department-of-education,"Since its inception 40 years ago as a political payoff from President Jimmy Carter to the National Education Association, the Department of Education has engaged in scores of dubious actions that have made millions of Americans yearn for its expulsion.

The most recent example of comes from a long string of audits showing the federal department is doing a lousy job keeping tabs on the $38 billion it receives to administer federally funded K–12 programs. “Complex and persistent” is how Congress’ spending watchdog, the Government Accountability Office, described the agency’s mismanagement of data, oversight, and evaluation.

It’s not surprising a colossal central bureaucracy cannot efficiently run 100,000 schools attended by 50 million children in 50 gloriously variegated states. The U.S. is a richly diverse country, and its families have widely different educational interests and needs.

The founders of our constitutional republic anticipated the pitfalls posed by big, intrusive government. They did not include education among the powers granted to the federal government. In fact, under the Bill of Rights (the often-overlooked 10th Amendment), they left authority over matters such as education expressly with the states and the people — where it rightfully belongs.

So, what is the expiration date for a federal education behemoth that shouldn’t exist in the first place?

Unfortunately, very few laws contain sunset provisions and “regulations almost never do,” Institute for Policy Innovation President Tom Giovanetti noted a few years ago. In other words, “we are piling up taxes, laws, and regulations that are outdated, ineffective, redundant, sometimes contradictory, and otherwise simply past their prime.” In 2015, Giovanetti proposed that every new law or regulation should contain a sunset clause after five years and after 10 years for any and all new agencies. If that commonsense guideline were actually in place, the Education Department would have probably been on the chopping block 30 years ago.

Partly by design and partly by accident, Idaho could be on the verge of providing a national test case for the sunset strategy. The Gem State stipulates that agency regulations will expire unless the legislature votes to reauthorize them. This year’s session ended in feuding, with House and Senate voting down each other’s bills. One of the casualties, the Associated Press reported, “was a bill approving 8,200 pages containing 736 chapters of rules and regulations that touch on just about every aspect of daily life in Idaho.”

The upshot of that fortuitous gridlock is that Republican Gov. Brad Little — a critic of excessive governmental regulations who in January ordered agencies to kill two regulations for every one they birthed — must decide by July 1 which regulations are important enough to be reinstated. News accounts suggest Little and his budget chief, Alex Adams, are downplaying the likelihood of sweeping policy changes.

Of course, some rules, such as those licensing hunting and fishing, are fairly innocuous. However, Wayne Hoffman, president of the Idaho Freedom Foundation, says Little could do more than simply tap the brakes on the administrative state: “He has a chance to discontinue a plethora of bad public policies.” For instance, he could pull out the failed Common Core education standards by their regulatory roots.

Regardless of what happens in Idaho, there is a lesson here for other states and the federal government in the value of having termination dates — not just for regulations, but for entire agencies too.

Meanwhile, Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., offered a sunset bill for the Department of Education, abolishing it at the end of 2020. A dissolution deadline would likely prompt a thorough examination of everything the department does and fails to do. Even better, it could devolve obsolete one-size-fits-all education federal programs, return taxing power to the states and localities, or transfer certain activities to other federal agencies.

Obviously, the Massie bill will not see the light of day in the current Democrat-led House of Representatives, where socialist schemes are the cause du jour. But if a sunset clause is never implemented, will inept and costly bureaucracies such as the Department of Education ever be dissolved?

"House committees launch probe into DHS shakeup, as White House blocks Miller testimony",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Brooke Singman', 'Brooke Singman Is A Politics Reporter For Fox News. Follow Her On Twitter At']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-committees-launch-probe-into-dhs-shakeup-after-miller-declines-invitation-to-testify,"Democrats on several top House committees launched an investigation Thursday into the massive shakeup in leadership at the Department of Homeland Security due to allegations that President Trump removed top officials for refusing to carry out his desired immigration policies.

House Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings, D-Md.; Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y.; and Homeland Security Committee Chair Bennie Thompson sent a letter to the Department of Homeland Security Thursday seeking documents related to recent immigration-related actions by the president and White House aide Stephen Miller ""to remove senior leaders throughout DHS who reportedly refused orders to violate the law.""

WHITE HOUSE DECLINES CUMMINGS' INVITATION FOR STEPHEN MILLER TO TESTIFY ON TRUMP IMMIGRATION POLICIES

The request comes amid a staffing shake-up at the agency which began earlier this month with the resignation of DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen.

“We are deeply concerned that the firing and forced resignation of these officials puts the security of the American people at risk,” they wrote. “We are also concerned that the President may have removed DHS officials because they refused his demands to violate federal immigration law and judicial orders.”

They added: “Moreover, we are concerned by reports that, even as he has removed the Department’s leadership, the President has sought to empower a White House aide, Stephen Miller, to ‘be in charge of handling all immigration and border affairs.’”

The letter was sent to DHS just hours after White House Counsel Pat Cipollone notified the House Oversight Committee that Miller would decline Cummings’ invitation to testify before the panel, and instead, offered cabinet secretaries and other agency officials to appear instead.

“In accordance with long-standing precedent, we respectfully decline the invitation to make Mr. Miller available for testimony before the Committee,” he wrote. “The precedent for members of the White House staff to decline invitations to testify before congressional committees has been consistently adhered to by administrations of both political parties, and is based on clearly established constitutional doctrines.”

He added: “In light of the Committee’s interest, we welcome the opportunity to discuss the Administration’s immigration policy priorities and note that many Executive Branch officials, including cabinet secretaries and other agency leaders, have testified on multiple occasions regarding the Administration’s efforts to secure the border.”

“Testimony by such Executive Branch officials with responsibilities defined by statute would be a reasonable accommodation to the Committee’s questions and legislative goals,” he wrote.

The White House’s decision comes after President Trump vowed this week to fight “all” subpoenas against the administration.

TRUMP, AGAIN, SAYS ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS WILL BE 'GIVEN' TO SANCTUARY CITIES, STATES

But the Oversight Committee did not subpoena Miller. Cummings invited Miller to testify on why he believes it is “good policy for the Trump administration to take the actions it has. Cummings noted the administration’s unofficial policy of separating immigrant children from their parents at the border, “transferring asylum seekers to sanctuary cities as a form of illegal retribution” against political adversaries, and “firing top Administration officials who refuse orders to violate the law.”

The invitation from Cummings came after Trump announced that illegal immigrants would be “given” to sanctuary cities, pending official decisions from the Department of Homeland Security. Also, earlier this month, Trump said that the administration has no plans to revive the controversial policy that allowed for family separations at the border.

That announcement came amid a massive shakeup at the Department of Homeland Security. Earlier this month, President Trump announced that Nielsen would be resigning, and replaced with former CBP Commissioner Kevin McAleenan, who would serve as acting secretary of the agency.

Since then, McAleenan appointed John Sanders to serve as acting CBP commissioner; former head of the Transportation Security Administration David Pekoske to be his acting deputy secretary at DHS; and Patricia Cogswell as acting TSA administrator. The White House earlier this month announced that James M. Murray would become head of the U.S. Secret Service—replacing Randolph “Tex” Alles.

Rod J. Rosenstein, again, was in danger of losing his job. The New York Times had just reported that — in the heated days after James B. Comey was fired as FBI director — the deputy attorney general had suggested wearing a wire to surreptitiously record President Trump. Now Trump, traveling in New York, was on the phone, eager for an explanation.

Rosenstein — who, by one account, had gotten teary-eyed just before the call in a meeting with Trump’s chief of staff — sought to defuse the volatile situation and assure the president he was on his team, according to people familiar with matter. He criticized the Times report, published in late September, and blamed it on former deputy FBI director Andrew McCabe, whose recollections formed its basis. Then he talked about special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s investigation of Russia’s interference in the 2016 election and told the president he would make sure Trump was treated fairly, people familiar with the conversation said.

“I give the investigation credibility,” Rosenstein said, according to an administration official with knowledge of what was said during the call. “I can land the plane.”

[Rosenstein-McCabe feud dates back to angry standoff in front of Mueller]

The episode illustrates the political tightrope Rosenstein has had to walk in his two years as the Justice Department’s second-in-command. To keep his job, the deputy attorney general has worked to mollify an often angry Trump, while at the same time protecting the special counsel’s investigation of the president and his campaign. Rosenstein’s actions have come under renewed scrutiny, as he has played a key role in releasing Mueller’s findings in a way even some of his supporters say has been overly favorable to Trump.

In a statement for this article, Rosenstein said: “The only commitment I made to President Trump about the Russia investigation is the same commitment I made to the Congress: so long as I was in charge, it would be conducted appropriately and as expeditiously as possible. Everyone who actually participated in the investigation knows that.”

He added: “My relationship with the President is not one-dimensional. The Russia investigation represents only a fraction of my work and the work of the Department of Justice. I talk with the President at every opportunity about the great progress we have made and are making at the Department of Justice in achieving the Administration’s law enforcement priorities and protecting American citizens.”

A person familiar with Rosenstein’s account said the deputy attorney general disputes that he was teary-eyed in the meeting before the call with Trump. “He was reacting appropriately given the circumstances, which was a discussion about his forced resignation,” the person said.

But Rosenstein — whose representatives were approached for comment for this report earlier in the week — acknowledged in a combative speech Thursday night in New York that there were times during his tenure as deputy attorney general when he grew upset.

“One silly question that I get from reporters is, ‘Is it true that you got angry and emotional a few times over the past few years?’ Heck yes! Didn’t you?” Rosenstein said, deviating from his prepared script.

Trump ended the call with Rosenstein thinking he was “on the team after all,” one senior administration official said, adding that the president has been further swayed by Rosenstein’s deference in meetings and other settings.

On multiple occasions, according to people familiar with the matter, Rosenstein told Trump he was not a “target” of Mueller’s investigation — using law enforcement jargon that can refer to people about whom the Justice Department has gathered substantial evidence of criminal wrongdoing. Mueller’s report makes clear that investigators focused on Trump; his attorneys were informed he was a “subject,” a different bureaucratic term meaning his conduct was being investigated. And Mueller’s report details conduct that legal observers have said could constitute obstruction of justice.

Rosenstein also told the president more than once that he agreed Trump was being treated unfairly — though one person familiar with the matter said Rosenstein was probably referring to media coverage rather than the investigation itself. That person, like others in this article, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive internal government deliberations.

In his speech Thursday, Rosenstein launched a blistering attack on the media, an offensive likely to hearten Trump.

“Some of the nonsense that passes for breaking news today would not be worth the paper it was printed on, if anybody bothered to print it,” he said.

He also criticized the Obama administration for not publicizing the “full story” about Russian hacking and social media influence operations and cited a quote from Trump to make a point about the rule of law.

[Rosenstein fires back at critics over Mueller report]

'My job is to stand here'

Rosenstein, who appointed Mueller as special counsel after Comey’s firing, is no stranger to political blows — from the right, from the left and from the man who nominated him for the job. At the end of Mueller’s probe, though, Rosenstein might have been able to avoid some punches, since the ultimate decisions would be up to Attorney General William P. Barr.

Instead, he leaned in.

In rare public comments in recent weeks, Rosenstein has lauded Barr to Time magazine and derided as “bizarre” allegations that Barr was trying to mislead the public about Mueller’s work by glossing over the most serious findings about Trump’s behavior, as Democrats have argued.

Rosenstein stood behind the attorney general when Barr held a news conference to assert that the president had not colluded with Russia and that there was not a prosecutable case against Trump for obstruction of justice. The deputy attorney general’s unmoving gaze sparked speculation that he felt uncomfortable with what was happening; Barr, after all, was going further than Mueller had and repeatedly uttered one of the president’s preferred expressions — “no collusion.”

But Barr had written in a letter to lawmakers that he and Rosenstein had decided together there was not a prosecutable obstruction case, and a Justice Department official noted that Rosenstein stepped away from a family vacation in Florida to be at the news conference. He flew back to Florida later that day, the official said.

Rosenstein said in his speech Thursday: “Last week, the big topic of discussion was, ‘What were you thinking when you stood behind Bill Barr at that press conference, with a deadpan expression?’ The answer is I was thinking, ‘My job is to stand here with a deadpan expression.’ ”

“Can you imagine if I did anything other than stand there at the press conference?” he added. “Imagine the reaction and the commentary if I had smiled or grimaced.”

[Barr under fire for news conference that was a boon for Trump]

Defenders of the special counsel’s probe had long viewed Rosenstein as one of the last bastions guarding the investigation. But Barr’s comments, in their view, misrepresented Mueller’s full report and seemed designed to protect the president. And Rosenstein was at least willing to go along with them.

Former U.S. attorney Barbara McQuade, who served with Rosenstein when he was a U.S. attorney in the Obama administration, said she considered Rosenstein “honorable.” But she said she was mystified that he would sign on to Barr’s decision that there was not a prosecutable obstruction case against Trump when Mueller pointedly would not say that.

“His name is included in the letter, and he stood by his side at the press conference, so somehow he got on board with that decision,” McQuade said. “It seems really strange to me.”

Others were more critical.

“I think Rod’s intentions were largely in the right place, but he was weak too many times when the country needed him to be strong,” said Matthew Miller, a Justice Department spokesman during the Obama administration. “He didn’t have to allow the attorney general to use his name in his letter and the press conference, but he has too often been willing to sacrifice his reputation to please people above him.”

A person close to Rosenstein said the deputy attorney general — in his dealings with Trump and others — sought to protect the investigation.

'I don't want to go out with a tweet'

Rosenstein’s status in the eyes of the White House has been fluid, but it was perhaps never more tenuous than after the New York Times reported he had suggested wearing a wire to record Trump.

After the article was published, then-White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly summoned Rosenstein to discuss it. The deputy attorney general would not address specific details of the article but told Kelly he was willing to step aside, two people familiar with the matter said. He talked about his long career at the Justice Department and his reputation, which he did not want Trump to tarnish, the people said.

“I can go. I’m ready to go. I can resign. But I don’t want to go out with a tweet,” the deputy attorney general said, according to one person’s account. Trump routinely makes significant personnel announcements via Twitter.

The person said Rosenstein left for another, regularly scheduled White House meeting but soon had a call with Trump. Even in the days that followed, his departure seemed so certain that the Justice Department lined up a succession plan. But Rosenstein ultimately met with Trump aboard Air Force One a few weeks later and remained at the Justice Department. He might do so almost up to the point his successor is confirmed.

[From September: Rosenstein’s departure was imminent. Now he is likely to survive until after the midterms, officials say]

Trump has nominated Deputy Transportation Secretary Jeffrey Rosen to replace Rosenstein. Rosen still needs confirmation by the Senate — which could come next month.

Rosenstein’s defenders say he is a prosecutor at heart, guided by doing what he thinks is right rather than which side of the political aisle will support him. They note that he has faced criticism from politicians of both parties and that the same people who now worry about him praised him for appointing Mueller.

“You had people drawing a red line around him to protect him in the beginning. Now those same people are going to say, ‘Oh, he’s a conservative hack,’ ” said James M. Trusty, a partner at Ifrah Law and a friend of Rosenstein’s. “In the future, as people look back, there’s lots of room for criticism on lots of things at the FBI and DOJ, but I think he’ll be acquitted nicely.”

The firing of Comey

Rosenstein was installed as the deputy attorney general in April 2017, and only a few weeks into his tenure, he confronted the crisis that would come to define it. Trump, upset over the Russia investigation, wanted to fire Comey, who would not say publicly that Trump was not a target of the Russia probe. After having advisers draft a letter firing Comey, the president was persuaded to talk to Rosenstein and then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions, according to Mueller’s report.

In a May 8 meeting with White House lawyers, Rosenstein and Sessions “criticized Comey and did not raise concerns about replacing him,” according to Mueller’s report. Later that day, in front of the president, Rosenstein described his concerns with Comey’s handling of the investigation of Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server while she was in government, according to the report.

Notes from one participant in the meeting say that Trump told Rosenstein to draft a recommendation about the firing and to include in it that Comey had refused to say Trump was not personally targeted by the Russia investigation, according to Mueller’s report. Rosenstein, according to the notes, said that was not the basis for his recommendation, so he did not think Russia should be mentioned.

According to Mueller’s report, Rosenstein left the meeting and told others his reasons for replacing Comey were not the same as Trump’s. The next day, he turned in a memorandum saying the FBI was “unlikely to regain public and congressional trust” with an unrepentant Comey at the helm. Though the memo did not mention Russia, it offered Trump some political cover. The president fired Comey, and White House aides berated reporters who suggested the move was based on anything other than Rosenstein’s recommendation. The White House released Rosenstein’s memo to support Trump’s action.

Comey’s termination sparked a crisis at the FBI and Justice Department. The deputy attorney general believed the White House was misstating his role in the decision. FBI leaders — acting director McCabe in particular — grew distrustful of Rosenstein.

At a meeting that month, according to McCabe’s recollection captured in contemporaneous memos, Rosenstein suggested he could wear a wire to surreptitiously record the president and talked in passing of using the 25th Amendment to oust Trump from office. Rosenstein has generally disputed that account. But on May 17, he took the dramatic step of appointing Mueller as special counsel — giving the Russia investigation some measure of independence.

McCabe remained worried. At a meeting shortly after Mueller’s appointment, he and Rosenstein each suggested the other should recuse himself from the case, though neither did, people familiar with the matter have said.

Mueller’s report says the special counsel’s team interviewed Rosenstein on May 23 — making it one of the earliest conversations the team had with a witness. Kerri Kupec, a Justice Department spokeswoman, said career ethics officials at the department determined he did not need to recuse.

Trump was already incensed at Sessions for recusing himself from the Russia case, and he would soon turn his ire on the deputy attorney general — deriding him as a “Democrat from Baltimore.” Rosenstein had been the U.S. attorney in Maryland during the Obama administration, but he is a Republican and lives in Bethesda, Md., a suburb of Washington.

Conservative allies of the president, led by Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), pushed Rosenstein to turn over information on the Russia investigation and last April drafted articles of impeachment against him. Meadows and others also privately complained to Trump about his deputy attorney general.

For his part, Rosenstein publicly fought back, declaring at an event last May that the Justice Department was “not going to be extorted.”

But while he was sparring with Trump’s allies, the deputy attorney general was also maintaining the kind of workplace diplomacy that wins bosses’ favor. He frequently called and wrote letters to White House aides when they were in the news, or when they celebrated their birthday, people familiar with the matter said. He was recently spotted hugging the president’s personal assistant and other aides at the annual Gridiron Club dinner, and on Monday he was photographed at the White House Easter Egg Roll, waiting in line to greet one of the president’s closest advisers, Kellyanne Conway.

"Attorney General Bill Barr Directs John Gore, A Top Justice Department Official, To Defy Congress Over Census",https://www.thedailybeast.com,['Betsy Woodruff'],04-24-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/john-gore-a-top-doj-official-will-defy-congress,"John Gore, a top official in the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division, will not appear for a deposition scheduled for tomorrow with the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, according to a letter the Justice Department sent the committee chairman on April 24.

Stephen Boyd, the department’s top Hill liaison, wrote in the letter, which The Daily Beast obtained, that Gore will not appear as long as Chairman Elijah Cummings blocks him from bringing along lawyers from the Justice Department.

“We are disappointed that the Committee remains unwilling to permit Department counsel to represent the interests of the Executive Branch in the deposition of a senior Department official,” Boyd wrote. “Accordingly, Attorney General Barr’s determination that Mr. Gore will not appear at the Committee’s deposition unless a Department attorney may accompany him remains in effect.”

The committee wants to question Gore about his role in the Trump administration’s effort to add a question to the 2020 Census about citizenship. The committee authorized a subpoena of Gore earlier this month. His refusal to participate in a deposition may result in an effort by the committee to hold him in contempt.

“In keeping with longstanding Department of Justice policy, neither Mr. Gore nor anyone else in the Department will be forced to testify in their capacity as a DOJ official on DOJ matters without DOJ counsel,” said Kerri Kupec, a department spokesperson.

In a statement, Cummings said Gore is still obligated to appear for the deposition.

“This is a massive, unprecedented, and growing pattern of obstruction,” he said. “Yesterday, President Trump declared to the entire country that he would obstruct Congress and order all White House officials to defy lawful subpoenas from Congress. Today, the Trump Administration went even further by expanding this policy to employees at federal agencies—even when the subpoenas are bipartisan and supported by Republican Members of Congress.”

He added that Committee staff will be available for the interview if Gore changes his mind.

“Committee investigators will gather tomorrow morning for this deposition—as scheduled—and we hope Mr. Gore will fulfill his legal and ethical responsibilities and appear as ordered,” he said.

A spokesperson for the committee’s Republicans, meanwhile, pointed out that Gore already appeared for a transcribed interview with staff and said Cummings’ subpoena is “part and parcel of his broader partisan oversight agenda.”

Gore will be the highest-profile Trump administration official to defy a congressional subpoena—so far. Earlier this week, the lawyer for Carl Kline, a career official who green-lit Jared Kushner’s security clearance, told Cummings he will not participate in a deposition about that issue unless lawyers from the White House Counsel’s Office can attend. Cummings has taken steps to hold him in contempt of Congress. If the House votes to hold him in contempt—a safe bet—then they may refer the matter to the D.C. U.S. Attorney. That attorney is Jessie Liu, a Trump appointee.

Gore will find himself in a similar situation if the House votes to hold him in contempt.

These cases will test the power of congressional committees. In the past, efforts to compel testimony have garnered mixed results; House Republicans famously voted to hold then-Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt in 2012 while investigating the Fast and Furious scandal. Despite the contempt vote, Holder still didn’t comply with the House’s demands.

The census investigation is of paramount importance to Democrats, who argue the question about the citizenship will discourage participation. Less participation could result in millions of people not being counted, they argue; and undercounting could mean a mis-apportionment of Congressional districts and lower levels of federal funding to communities that are underrepresented. Republicans, meanwhile, argue the federal government has asked about citizenship in the past and that it won’t result in unfairness.

Democrats and other opponents of the citizenship question, including multiple civil rights groups, sued to keep it from appearing on the census. The Supreme Court heard oral arguments on that litigation earlier this week. Observers have guessed that the court will lean in the direction of allowing the question."
Veterans slam Ocasio-Cortez for her fierce defense of the VA,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],04-25-2019,2019,4,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/veterans-slam-ocasio-cortez-for-her-fierce-defense-of-the-va,"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's fierce defense of the Department of Veteran Affairs, saying, ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it,"" has earned her flak from the very people who are served by the scandal-ridden agency: veterans.

During the same town hall, she said VA would be a blueprint if ""Medicare for all"" were to pass: “If you ask me, I would like VA for all.""

Eli Crane, a former Navy SEAL who now runs the company he started from his garage while on active duty, told the Washington Examiner that the New York Democrat's comments about not fixing the VA were ironic, given that Ocasio-Cortez, who identifies as a democratic socialist, ""is trying to fix the world's greatest economy of all time.""

""I would love to see her tell that to the family members of veterans who died waiting for treatment from the VA. As veterans, we deserve the same rights that private citizens have to shop around and find healthcare options, doctors and providers that fit our medical needs,"" said Crane.

Afghanistan veteran Adam Maneen, a small business owner who identifies as a conservative, but also agrees with the idea of universal healthcare, told the Washington Examiner he believes Ocasio-Cortez's strong belief in democratic socialism leads her to fight the wrong battles.

""Ocasio-Cortez is upset with the notion of VA reform and ... is so fixated on socialism that she has developed a reflexive nature against anything that says ‘privatized' and really misses the point about reform,"" Maneen said. ""She is fighting the wrong fight. If she wants support to model universal healthcare after the VA, then she needs to honestly acknowledge the VA’s subpar care, inept leadership, and bureaucratic processes.""

Veterans also expressed their frustration on social media with Ocasio-Cortez's defense of the VA.

Dan Caldwell, executive director of Concerned Veterans for America, an advocacy group that promotes allowing veterans to pursue private medical care, told Fox News that reformers really just want to let veterans have more choice outside of VA hospitals to get treatment for their issues.

Ocasio-Cortez followed up her comments last week, saying part of the problem with the VA is the department not being fully funded.

If Congress wants to #ProtectTheVA, we shouldn’t starve it + then sell it off for parts, forcing vets into for-profit emergency rooms + to providers who aren’t used to working w/their unique medical needs.

The VA's budget is about $200 billion. The department is now requesting a total of $220.2 billion for the 2020 fiscal year, a 9.6% increase from the previous fiscal year. The VA's large budget was pointed out by Rep. Michael Waltz, R-Fla., who is also a Green Beret.

He said despite the large budget, the VA is still failing veterans.

FYI @AOC the VA budget doubled from $90B to $200B over the last 10 yrs.

Sound familiar?,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Michael Scherer', 'National Political Reporter Covering Campaigns', 'Congress', 'The White House', 'April At Am']",04-27-2019,2019,4,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/joe-bidens-pitch-make-america-great-again-sound-familiar/2019/04/27/c7a041a0-6858-11e9-a1b6-b29b90efa879_story.html,"Former vice president Joe Biden also wants to make America great again — just not like that.

There will be no red ball caps or lock-him-up chants, but the underlying focus on a festering nostalgia for a prior era has been unmistakable in the opening days of his presidential campaign.

Whereas President Trump evoked an idyllic past of greater economic prosperity and less political correctness, the bygone era that Biden pines for is a time before Trump, when American presidents sought to unify the country and build up national institutions.

“This is not who we are, the way we are treating people,” Biden said in his first interview as a candidate on ABC’s “The View” on Friday. “There is an American creed. It’s about decency, honor, including everyone, leaving no one behind.”

In that way, Biden has rejected the conventional wisdom ascendant in Democratic politics by framing the campaign as a referendum on Trump’s character and his behavior in office. Biden and his advisers have bet his candidacy on the idea that a focus on the incumbent, more than new policy ideas, anti-establishment crusades or ideological innovation, will win back the White House for Democrats.

The decision led to launching the campaign with a video about Trump’s reaction to the 2017 Charlottesville protests, a circumstance the Biden team felt presented a clear contrast in values.

“The president of the United States assigned a moral equivalence between those spreading hate and those with the courage to stand against it,” Biden said, referring to Trump’s comment that “very fine people” were among the white nationalists and neo-Nazis at the violent conflict. “And in that moment, I knew the threat to this nation was unlike any I had ever seen in my lifetime.”

People familiar with Biden’s thinking say that the Charlottesville protests and the president’s reaction caused a real shift in 2017 in the former vice president’s desire to run for president. Andrew Bates, a spokesman for the campaign, said Biden found the events “profoundly disturbing.”

Two weeks later, Biden decided to break the tradition of former presidents and vice presidents by writing an article that compared Trump to “the charlatans and the con-men and the false prophets who have long dotted our history.”

“I think Charlottesville brought home to him in graphic terms what was at stake for the election in 2020,” said Ted Kaufman, a longtime friend and adviser who worked on both of Biden’s previous presidential campaigns. “When he is the most energized is with situations where some strong person is exerting power over someone weaker.”

While reelection efforts are commonly referendums on the incumbent, a credo for other Democrats this year has been a rapt focus on either policy or personality — in both cases, their own, and not Trump’s. That flowed from Democratic congressional successes in the midterm elections that hammered issues like health care and education and consigned the president to an afterthought.

As Biden planned a campaign launch, he and his aides decided they did not need to follow the traditional playbook of biographic details attached to a list of policy pronouncements, according to people familiar with the effort. Unlike most of his Democratic rivals, polls show he has nearly universal name recognition 46 years after he first became a federal officeholder.

The pending debate over the ideological direction of the Democratic Party was not an ideal starting place for a candidate aiming to keep the sheen of an heir apparent, his advisers counseled. That was particularly true given that Biden’s moderate and incremental instincts don’t jibe with the ascendant and loudly liberal voices that have dominated the Democratic conversation so far.

The strongest place to begin was on the question of character, where they contend Biden has an advantage over the president in a head-to-head matchup.

“Even Mitch McConnell would probably tell you that,” said one person familiar with the discussions, who asked for anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, in reference to the Senate majority leader’s long track record of cutting deals with Biden.

Biden’s ability to control the story line of his campaign, however, is certain to be tested. Before his announcement, he has been hit with questions about his past opposition to school busing and his friendships with former segregationist lawmakers, with whom he said he disagreed. His campaign announcement was disrupted by news that Anita Hill, the sexual harassment accuser of Justice Clarence Thomas, was still not satisfied with Biden’s contrition for how he ran the confirmation hearing at which she appeared in 1991.

Biden’s rival candidates also welcomed him to the race with criticism. On his first day as a candidate, Biden attended a fundraiser at the home of a Comcast executive and former lobbyist in Philadelphia, prompting Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) to send an email to supporters noting that he was not spending time “at the home of a corporate lobbyist.” Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) told an audience Thursday in Iowa that during a fight over bankruptcy reform more than a decade ago, “Joe Biden was on the side of credit card companies.”

Biden’s confidants say they have no illusions about how hard the campaign will be, and Democratic strategists not on the campaign predict that Biden will have to pivot away from Trump and emphasize voter-pleasing policy positions to get through the primary.

“The central rationale for Joe Biden’s candidacy is that Trump represents an existential threat to core values and that Biden is the best candidate to defeat Trump,” said Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster who is not working for his campaign. “Biden still will need to lay out his progressive agenda for the next four years, presumably one that will focus on economics, especially creating jobs, rewarding work, and making it easier for people to get to and stay in the middle class.”

The early signs are that Biden will also approach that task by referencing the better days. Rather than simply talk about the middle class, he spoke on “The View” about the need to “restore the dignity of work.” His speech and rally at a union hall in Pittsburgh on Monday has been teased as a discussion about “rebuilding America’s middle class.”

The focus backward could exacerbate concerns about Biden’s age, 76, which would make him the oldest president to ever take the oath of office. In recent months, he has been one of the only presidential contenders who has regularly appeared in public with note cards, including a paper he brought with him to his Friday morning appearance on ABC.

In that interview, he initially struggled to answer a question about how his presidency would differ from Barack Obama’s administration. He spoke about his close relationship with the former president and quiet disagreements, without offering specifics. But then he pivoted to the challenge ahead for his campaign.

“On a philosophic basis, it’s about moving to the future,” he said. “It’s not about re-creating what we did. It’s about taking the same decency and philosophy that we had and taking it into the future. There is so much we can do. My Lord.”

Just what that will look like has not yet been described."
JetBlue expands use of facial recognition software at airports via Homeland Security database,https://www.bostonherald.com,"['Jonathan Ng', 'Jonathan Ng Is A Staff Business Reporter For The Boston Herald', 'Covering Real Estate', 'Casino', 'Economic Development', 'Neighborhoods Issues.']",04-27-2019,2019,4,https://www.bostonherald.com/2019/04/27/jetblue-expands-use-of-facial-recognition-software-at-airports-via-homeland-security-database/,"A JetBlue passenger was shocked when she was directed to have her face scanned through recognition software in place of a boarding pass.

Sharing her experience on Twitter, MacKenzie Fegan said, “Instead of scanning my boarding pass or handing over my passport, I looked into a camera before being allowed down the jet bridge. Did facial recognition replace boarding passes, unbeknownst to me? Did I consent to this?”

Did facial recognition replace boarding passes, unbeknownst to me? Did I consent to this? — MacKenzie Fegan (@mackenzief) April 17, 2019

According to the airline operator, the device used facial recognition software to identify Fegan and allowed her to board the plane in lieu of a boarding pass. JetBlue said Fegan could have opted out of using the facial recognition software. Fegan asked the company how it matches the photo to a person’s identity, to which JetBlue responded, “The information is provided by the United States Department of Homeland Security from existing holdings.”

JetBlue explained: “These photos aren’t provided to us, but are securely transmitted to the Customs and Border Protection database. JetBlue does not have direct access to the photos and doesn’t store them.”

Last year, JetBlue hailed itself as an industry leader as “the first domestic airline to launch a fully-integrated biometric self-boarding gate for international flights.”

Through a partnership with U.S. Customs and Border Protection, JetBlue said, the facial recognition software can verify travelers “with a quick photo capture,” and will allow passengers to “board even faster with a dual lane biometric self-boarding gate.”

Pitching the program as a matter of convenience, JetBlue Senior Vice President Ian Deason said in a press release titled, “Your Face is Your Boarding Pass,” that the boarding procedures are “an area that needs innovation and we feel biometrics will change the future of air travel.”

A recent Department of Homeland Security report said the agency is working toward “full implementation” of facial recognition technology within the next four years, and estimates it will “account for over 97 percent of departing commercial air travelers from the United States.”

“Since its inception, over two million passengers on over 15,000 flights have used the technology on exit, with an average biometric match rate of 98 percent,” said Kevin McAleenan, the acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, in the report.

“The biometric matching service is a robust cloud-based service that leverages existing advance passenger information to create a pre-positioned ‘gallery’ of face images from U.S. Government holdings,” the report states. The photos come from passport applications, visa applications, or interactions with CBP at a prior border encounter.

“The biometric matching service then compares a live photo of the traveler to the gallery of face images for that flight to identify the traveler and enable CBP to confirm the traveler’s crossing. On exit, the matching service identifies the traveler, creates an exit record, and enables CBP to biometrically confirm the departure of in-scope, non-U.S. citizen.”

In 2017, the airline piloted its biometric software recognition program at several airports, including Logan International Airport. “Since the program’s launch in 2017, more than 50,000 customers have participated in biometric boarding on 500+ flights across all four cities. There is no pre-registration required. Customers can simply step up to the camera for a photo match and make their way onto the aircraft,” the company said in November."
Justice Department Charges Judge Who Helped Immigrant Evade ICE In Her Courthouse,https://slate.com,['Mark Joseph Stern'],04-25-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/ice-courthouse-judge-shelley-joseph-indicted.html,"Immigrant rights advocates protest the Trump administration’s immigration policies in New York in June 2018. Spencer Platt/Getty Images

A Massachusetts judge has been indicted for helping an unauthorized immigrant avoid Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers in her own courthouse.

The U.S. Attorney’s Office in Boston released the indictment on Thursday, charging Judge Shelley Richmond Joseph with obstruction of justice. Federal prosecutors also secured the indictment of Wesley MacGregor, a court officer, for obstruction and perjury. The charges constitute a remarkable intrusion into the internal affairs of a state judiciary and possible retaliation against Massachusetts’ “sanctuary” policies. Rarely in modern history has the federal government sought to punish a state judge acting in exercise of judicial functions. This prosecution sends a clear threat to state courts around the country that do not want to be commandeered by ICE.

Thursday’s charges stem from an incident on April 2, 2018, when Joseph held an arraignment hearing for Jose Medina-Perez, who has resided in the United States unlawfully. Medina-Perez had been arrested on drug charges by police in Newton, Massachusetts, where Joseph presides. Prosecutors initially believed he also had an outstanding warrant for drunk driving. But on April 2, Assistant District Attorney Shannon Jurgens concluded that Medina-Perez was not the individual named in the warrant. She also declined to request that the state hold him the drug charges. So Joseph ordered him released.

That’s when the trouble began. Joseph and the attorneys were aware that a plainclothes ICE officer was present to arrest Medina-Perez once the hearing concluded; the judge had asked him to wait outside the courtroom. Before releasing him, Joseph held a sidebar with Medina-Perez’s attorney, David Jellinek. She asked Jellinek, “ICE is gonna get him?” She then asked him “What if we detain him?” Then she had the court recorder turned off for an “off the record” conversation, in apparent violation of the Massachusetts Rules of Court. After the recording resumed, Joseph ordered Medina-Perez released. MacGregor escorted him to a backdoor exit, avoiding the ICE officer just outside the courtroom. Medina-Perez left, successfully evading arrest.

Prosecutors allege that Joseph and MacGregor conspired to help the immigrant elude ICE, thereby obstructing justice. (They also claim that MacGregor lied to a grand jury during the ensuing federal investigation.) The indictment alleges that, when the recorder shut off, Joseph and Jellinek (who has not been charged) “discussed devising a way” to help Medina-Perez escape ICE, which had a detainer for his arrest.

Joseph’s case is certain to prompt an outcry from civil liberties advocates who oppose ICE’s aggressive invasion of state courthouses to seize immigrants suspected of lacking proper documentation. Newton is a “sanctuary city”—municipal law bars local officials from helping federal agents detain unauthorized immigrants. Moreover, Massachusetts is a partial “sanctuary state,” as the Supreme Judicial Court has ruled that state court officers cannot legally comply with ICE detainers. (These detainers, or “immigration holds,” direct officers to hold immigrants in custody until ICE can retrieve them.)

There is, however, a line between refusing to cooperate with ICE and actively obstructing ICE’s operations. Joseph and MacGregor are alleged to have crossed that line. It is gratifying to see that the Justice Department still believes that obstruction of justice can occur, but this case is a curious one to pursue.

Joseph will surely raise the defense of judicial immunity, since judges generally have absolute immunity for actions they take in their official capacity. For that reason, prosecutors are famously hesitant to charge judges for any exercise of their judicial function. To win this case, prosecutors may have to prove that Joseph did not engage in a judicial act when she allowed Medina-Perez to leave out the back door. But judges typically have the power to determine how an individual in custody is released, so the prosecution may prove to be an uphill climb. (Prosecutors will surely cite the fact that Joseph turned the court recorder off, in apparent violation of the court’s rules, as evidence that the judge knew she wasn’t acting in a lawful, official capacity.)

This case, then, appears deeply political—a warning to judges who, like Joseph, will not collude with ICE under any circumstances, and may even work to thwart ICE’s goals. Few, if any, contemporary legal disputes involve such a direct clash between federal and state authority; one might need to revisit the Fugitive Slave Act cases to locate a roughly analogous conflict between federal authorities and state courts. While the legal issues here are murky and complex, the message from the Justice Department is clear: State judges who help immigrants evade arrest in jurisdictions with sanctuary policies may themselves wind up behind bars."
Trump's acting defense secretary called F-35 fighter jet program 'f----d up',https://www.cnn.com,['Zachary Cohen'],04-25-2019,2019,4,https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/25/politics/pentagon-gao-patrick-shanahan-f-35/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan told investigators from the Pentagon's Office of the Inspector General that he called the F-35 fighter jet program ""f----d up,"" but made clear that he wasn't referring to the aircraft itself, which he said was ""awesome,"" according to a Department of Defense report released Thursday.

Shanahan's comments were detailed as part of an ethics investigation by the Pentagon's Office of the Inspector General into allegations he was promoting the interests of his former employer, Boeing, and repeatedly disparaging the company's competitor, Lockheed Martin, which is the primary contractor for the F-35 fighter jet.

Ultimately, Shanahan was cleared of any wrongdoing as investigators determined his ""comments about the F-35 program were substantive, related to the program's performance, and were consistent with comments about the F-35 program made by other senior Government officials.""

But his troubling assessment of the state of the F-35 program, particularly his concern about the lack of spare aircraft parts, was only amplified by a separate report released Thursday from a federal watchdog group.

Nearly 30% of the US military's F-35 stealth fighter jets were unable to fly during a months-long period last year due to a shortage of spare parts, according to a new report from the Government Accountability Office.

""F-35 aircraft were unable to fly nearly 30 percent of the May -- November 2018 time period due to spare parts shortages,"" the GAO said, noting that the Department of Defense has a ""repair backlog of about 4,300 F-35 parts.""

The pair of reports released Thursday raise additional questions about the state of the world's most expensive weapon system. Specifically, the inspector general report makes it clear that investigators considered the fact that Shanahan had told them he was not criticizing the aircraft itself but the program as a whole, when assessing whether he had violated any ethics agreements.

""Mr. Shanahan told us that he did not say that the F-35 aircraft was 'f----d up.' He told us that the F-35 aircraft is 'awesome,' the report states.""Mr. Shanahan told us that he said the F-35 program was 'f----d up.' ""

""He added that these comments were ""always relative to a level of performance, and the number of categories where you have ... fundamental problems,"" it adds, noting Shanahan's overall criticisms of the F-35 program were based on a variety of issues, including ""insufficient spare parts in the inventory"" and the cost per flight hour not decreasing fast enough.""

The F-35 fighter jet is touted as the future of military aviation; a lethal and versatile aircraft that combines stealth capabilities, supersonic speed, extreme agility and state-of-the-art sensor fusion technology, according to Lockheed Martin.

The jet -- which maintains stealth capabilities, making it harder for enemy radars to detect -- has been a favorite of President Donald Trump, who has lauded the F-35 several times for being ""invisible.""

However, the aircraft has also drawn sharp criticism in recent years after facing a long list of setbacks -- including problems with software, engines and weapon systems.

And critics have continued to express skepticism about its combat capability despite reassurances by US military leaders who say the kinks are being worked out.

More questions have been raised about the F-35 this month after one flown by the Japanese Self-Defense Force crashed into the Pacific. Japan has since grounded its remaining fleet of 12 of the stealth jets.

Tokyo plans to make the planes the mainstay of its fleet, with 147 in house or on order. South Korea and Australia also fly the F-35 in the Pacific, and Singapore has said it wants to buy the jets.

Specifically, issues related to the aircraft's supply chain remain an obvious concern as sustainment costs for the F-35 are estimated at more than $1 trillion over a 60-year life cycle, according to GAO estimates.

""F-35 aircraft performance is falling short of warfighter requirements -- that is, aircraft cannot perform as many missions or fly as often as required,"" the GAO found. ""This lower-than-desired aircraft performance is due largely to F-35 spare parts shortages and difficulty in managing and moving parts around the world.""

The Pentagon and Lockheed Martin have both said they are working with the GAO to implement specific recommendations outlined in its latest report.

""The department worked with the Government Accountability Office on this F-35 sustainment report. The department concurred with all eight of the report recommendations, and provided a specific, official response to each as detailed on pages 69-72 of the report,"" Defense Department spokesperson Lt. Col. Mike Andrews said in a statement to CNN.

Lockheed Martin also said it is ""taking aggressive action to build supply chain capacity, reduce supply chain costs and improve part availability to help drive sustainment costs down while enhancing readiness.""

""We are investing, taking aggressive action and partnering with the government and our supply base to achieve shared cost reduction goals, while also improving readiness to meet the Pentagon's 80 percent mission capable rate,"" the company said in a statement."
"China able to grab ‘entire digital identity’ of Western citizens, State Department says",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],04-26-2019,2019,4,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/defense-national-security/china-able-to-grab-entire-digital-identity-of-western-citizens-state-department-says,"Chinese surveillance tactics “pose an existential threat"" to the nations of the Western Hemisphere, a senior State Department official warned Friday.

“Citizens living in democracies in the Western Hemisphere could potentially have their entire digital identity under the control and surveillance of an authoritarian government,” Kimberly Breier, the State Department’s top diplomat for the region, told the Council of the Americas.

Breier was chiefly addressing Latin America, with a focus on how China distributes surveillance technology and wireless internet services that leave Westerners exposed to Beijing’s prying eyes. China has been selling its high-tech authoritarianism to dictators such as Venezuela's Nicolás Maduro, and even countries friendlier to the United States have been opening their telecommunications networks to Chinese tech companies.

FBI Director Christopher Wray, speaking separately at the Council on Foreign Relations, emphasized the same day that the Communist power is targeting the United States as aggressively as any regional neighbor.

“China has pioneered a societal approach to stealing innovation any way it can, from a wide array of businesses, universities, and organizations,” Wray said. “They’re doing this through Chinese intelligence services, through state-owned enterprises, through ostensibly private companies, through graduate students and researchers, and through a variety of actors working on behalf of China.”

Breier and Wray made their warnings as China is trying to allay international worries about the Belt and Road Initiative, an overseas investment plan that U.S. officials regard as a “predatory” lending scheme to purchase influence over impoverished nations. China is hosting an international summit in Beijing on Friday, convening Russia and other partner nations to tout the initiative.

“Naturally, it is important for China to successfully promote this large-scale project,” Russian President Vladimir Putin said in advance of Friday’s second Belt and Road Forum. ""And all Eurasian states should stand to gain from participation in it.”

Breier countered that China uses “bags of cash” to induce corrupt government officials to strike agreements that harm their countries. Those deals threaten long-term consequences beyond financial trouble. She stressed that the Chinese companies pioneering the next generation of wireless technology are under the thumb of Chinese spy agencies, meaning that partnerships with the tech giants could “have a generational impact on national security, on our economies, and on our societies.”

And she raised similar worries about simpler surveillance technologies, such as the security cameras that some Latin American governments have purchased from the Communist power, which has built a high-tech surveillance state to control its own population.

Governments, she said, ""need to rethink whether they want Chinese firms and indeed the Chinese government to replicate some of those same practices and, in so doing, erode protection of human rights in the hemisphere and cede national sovereignty."""
"Corruption and Mismanagement at USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service’s Put Consumers at Risk, Whistleblower Says",https://www.counterpunch.org,"['More Articles', 'Stanley L. Cohen', 'Vincent Navarro', 'Peter Linebaugh', 'Jeffrey St. Clair', 'Paul Street', 'Martha Rosenberg', ""John O'Kane"", 'Joshua Frank', 'Jennifer Matsui']",04-26-2019,2019,4,https://www.counterpunch.org/2019/04/26/corruption-and-mismanagement-at-usdas-food-safety-and-inspection-services-put-consumers-at-risk-whistleblower-says/,"by



The Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS), which operates under the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and employs more than 10,000 people, is tasked with ensuring the safety and proper labeling of U.S. meat, poultry and eggs.

FSIS inspectors are present at over 6,200 U.S. slaughter, food processing and import facilities to check for diseased animals, compliance with the Humane Slaughter Act, bacterial contamination and the presence of antibiotic, pesticide and other residues. FSIS investigators monitor sales and distribution of finished products to prevent disease outbreaks and to help initiate recalls of contaminated products when they occur.

The agency’s No. 1 job is to protect consumers. Yet according to a compliance operations official who worked at FSIS for many years, internal corruption, mismanagement, low morale and undisguised conflicts-of-interest within the agency often prevent FSIS inspectors and investigators from doing their jobs. It’s a public health crisis “just waiting to happen,” the official told us, on condition of anonymity.

Moreover, large meat producers like Cargill, Tyson, Smithfield, Swift (JBS) and Sanderson Farms are often given a “pass” thanks to their high-paid lobbyists: “The same misbranding or adulteration of product that would force an immediate recall from a small, ‘Ma and Pa’ company is overlooked with big meat companies,” says the official.

Inspectors in the line of fire

There are two kinds of inspector positions at FSIS––those who work the kill line in slaughter facilities, and consumer safety inspectors who check companies for compliance with their hazard analysis and critical control points (HACCP) plans. HACCP plans seek to prevent biological, chemical and physical hazards in food processing.

In the dysfunctional FSIS systems, said the official, slaughter line inspectors might have the toughest job of all––there are serious obstacles that prevent them from doing their jobs.

For example, FSIS inspectors can push a button and stop the slaughter line if they suspect a violation is occurring—but “they better be damn right or their head is going to be on the stick,” the official said. Stopping the line was estimated to cost a plant $5,000 a minute several years ago and costs have only risen. Inspectors are further deterred from taking action because they “may not be supported by their frontline supervisor or by the district office/management team.”

Under the Humane Slaughter Act, cattle and hogs first must be “stunned” with a blow to the head or an electric shock so they won’t feel the pain of slaughter. Yet the law is frequently broken, say insiders.

“In plants all over the United States, this happens on a daily basis,” said Lester Friedlander, a veterinarian and formerly chief government inspector at a Pennsylvania hamburger plant. “I’ve seen it happen. And I’ve talked to other veterinarians. They feel it’s out of control.”

The late Tim Walker complained about similar violations to a USDA veterinarian in the Florida slaughter plant where he was employed, as well as to all his supervisors. But no action was taken. Employees were afraid to speak out for fear they might lose their jobs.

Going directly to FSIS about violations feels to FSIS employees like “they are tattling on themselves,” according to our insider source, who said that some inspectors have even received death threats. When inspectors have been stationed at a particular plant for a while, they also may identify as that plant’s employee. In at least one major violation case, which became a scandal, an onsite inspector was having affair with an employee greatly complicating compliance. Fewer than 10 percent of inspector issues get to FSIS, our source told us, adding: “In fact inspectors are not even allowed to go directly to Compliance but rather must go through the chain of command at their plant.”

Nor are FSIS employees always backed up by their supervisors when they do seek to cite violations. Dr. Dean Wyatt, an FSIS supervisory public health veterinarian stationed at Vermont-area slaughterhouses testified at Congressional hearings that he was specifically instructed by his supervisors notto file violation reports–not to do his job–and that official reports were sanitized and deleted. Plant managers, sensing the lack of support, openly defied inspectors, and workers followed suit. In his testimony, Wyatt said:

“I was always shot down, so to speak, by my supervisors. I would walk by a plant foreman; they would laugh at me. I would go up to trim—I would give a rail inspector his break. Plant foreman would come up and tell my trimmer: ‘This guy doesn’t know anything. Don’t trim what he tells you. Just trim what you see.’ I mean, that is an example of the most egregious action a supervisor can take, because when you don’t support your inspectors you are just as guilty of breaking the law as the establishment, in my view.”

Cow heads exhibiting evidence of eye cancer switched to fool inspectors

Death threats, reluctance to stop the line and diminished inspector authority can allow unsafe food to be passed along to the public, according to the FSIS official who spoke to us. For instance, federal law prohibits dead and dying animals from being processed for meat for human consumption. Yet non-ambulatory animals (sometimes called “downers”) are “often” simply brought through a back door and still allowed into the food supply, the official said.

Such subterfuge led to one of FSIS’s most impressive actions, citing in instance where “We got the message that rendering was doing a lot of pickups at a particular location and investigated.” Rendering plants process animal by-products to make tallow, grease and high-protein meat and bone meal. FSIS’s investigation led to the 2014 recall of 8.7 million pounds of beef products processed by Rancho Feeding Corp. in Petaluma, California, because Rancho Feeding had processed sick animals, including some with eye cancer.

The recall included Walmart Fatburgers, Kroger Ground Beef Mini Sliders and several Nestle products, and encompassed California, Florida, Illinois and Texas. It included both familiar beef cuts and offal, which refers to the head, intestines, liver, tongue, feet, hearts, bones and trim derived from cattle.

While local beef ranchers had been taking their cattle to Rancho for slaughter, Rancho also often purchased spent dairy cows to sell as meat, many of which had eye cancer and other diseases. For more than a year, Rancho had operated an elaborate scheme to swap uninspected cows infected with cancerous eyes with cattle that had already passed ante mortem inspection. According to Food Safety News, government attorneys accused Rancho co-owner Jesse J. Amaral Jr.,

“of ordering Rancho employees to process cattle that were condemned by the USDA veterinarian. At his instruction, [co-owner Felix] Cabrera allegedly had workers cut the ‘USDA Condemned’ stamps out of the cattle carcasses so they could be processed for sale and distribution. At about the same time, court documents state that Amaral gave the foreman, Cabrera, and the yardman,[Eugene] Corda, directions on how to circumvent inspection procedures for cows with cancerous eyes. Both Amaral and [Robert] Singleton told their employees to swap out uninspected cows with cancerous eyes with cattle that had already passed ante mortem inspection, according to the documents.”

According to the federal indictment:

“Cabrera, or another kill floor employee at his instruction, placed heads from apparently healthy cows, which had been previously reserved, next to the cancer eye cow carcasses. The switch and slaughter of uninspected cancer eye cows occurred during the inspectors’ lunch breaks, at a time during which plant operations were supposed to cease.”

When the inspectors “returned from lunch for post mortem inspections, they were unaware that the carcasses they were inspecting belonged to cancerous cows that had escaped ante mortem inspection.”

In defending Rancho co-owner Amaral, his attorney blamed “significant errors” by FSIS inspection staff who were supposed to watch as condemned animals were destroyed “before their eyes.”

For government attorneys to take on a food case it must be airtight, as those attorneys are busy with arson and murder cases, the FSIS official told us. The Rancho Feeding case fit that criteria. In addition to the “yuck” factor of eating meat from beheaded cows with eye cancer, Rancho’s plot presented serious and deadly risks, the official said. The Rancho meat, sneaked past inspectors, could well have contained specified risk materials (SRMs) which could transmit BSE (Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy) commonly known as Mad Cow Disease.

This was not the first time the safety of Rancho’s operations was called into question. In late 2013, two cows slaughtered there had penicillin levels in their kidneys at 30 and 68 times the federal limits.

In 2014, Amaral was sentenced to one year in federal prison and a year of supervised release.

Impediments to recalls

The Rancho investigation, recall and legal proceedings that resulted in guilty pleas, convictions and jail time shows how the system is supposed to work.

But all too often, food lobbyists and lawyers are able to override recalls, according to the FSIS official who told us:

“The recall committee would be on the phone with perhaps 25 people including the food producer, lawyers, policy, science and public affairs personnel and investigators. Then there would be a sidebar––in which lawyers talk without FSIS staff being able to hear and the entire tone and then topic would have changed after the sidebar was finished.”

When a food safety violation is identified, FSIS typically tries to convince the food producer to do a voluntary recall. FSIS has the authority to seize products on its own. But neither party wants the red tape nightmare and heightened publicity for fear of casting the food producer, and even the U.S. supply, in a bad light. Still, it was not uncommon, according to our source, when FSIS personnel would say “if you don’t voluntarily recall, things could get rough for you,” that the food producer’s lawyer would respond with: “Show me the science. How do you know the problem is my guy’s canning and not someone else’s? You don’t have enough evidence.”

Not unlike other government-regulated industries, a revolving door and “old boys’ network” characterizes the relationship between the USDA and FSIS, and the captains of the meat industry, our source told us. Lobbyists, like those at the influential North American Meat Institute, are often former government workers or regulators who know how the game is played.

For example, in 2017, former FSIS deputy undersecretary Alfred Almanza left the agency to joinmeat giant JBS global which describes itself as “a leading processor of beef and pork in the U.S. and majority shareholder of Pilgrim’s Pride Corporation, the second largest poultry company in the U.S.”

The old boys’ network is enhanced by the fact that FSIS is housed within the USDA headquarters, instead of in separate, independent offices which would allow inspectors greater latitude.

While major food producers can often obviate recalls, smaller operations can’t the official told us: “What is very disturbing is the unfair application of FSIS regulations such as recalls. The little guy gets beat to death while a Cargill, Tyson or JBS will get a walk for the same violation.”

More threats to public health

In addition to FSIS’s many inspectors, investigators regularly visit food wholesalers, retailers and processors to regulate packaged and ready-to-sell items. Yet again, their work can be impeded. “If something does not look right to our inspectors, we ask to see records but they can be in a foreign language,” the official said.

Seafood can be especially tricky. In a 2011 USDA report assessing U.S. Food & Drug Administration third-party certification of Southeast Asian shrimp production, for example, there were found to be major language barriers. Six out of eight auditors didn’t even know what drugs and chemicals were approved in U.S. exports. When a country is blocked from shipping shrimp it often “transships” through a country that is believed to be safe, say seafood safety experts.

As with slaughterhouses, food processors and vendors are also known to deliberately attempt scams. According to the FSIS official: “My investigators found that a supplier of meat to prisons was misbranding and greatly inflating the amount of meat in their product which was actually only 80/20 ground beef. These are felonies for which people could potentially go to jail.”

When serious food safety risks are detected, FSIS quickly assesses the national marketplace and traces the risks back to their source. If patients have been hospitalized, FSIS acquires samples and will interview the patients along with local health departments and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In the face of a contamination outbreak, FSIS investigators will quickly visit wholesalers, retailers and processers with questions like “Where else did you ship product?” “Did you separate lots?” and “Did you wash and clean machinery on the line?”

But in addition to concerns about bacterial content, unlabeled ingredients/allergens, foreign substances/adulteration, misbranding and elaborate deception schemes as seen with Rancho Feeding, something else haunts the compliance operations official––agroterrorism:

“There is so much the general public doesn’t understand about food in general and meat in particular, and security itself at a meat processing is extremely loose. It does not even have to be international terrorism––it could be local. Employees could deliberately introduce a razor into product or unintentionally contaminate product with dangerous, infectious diseases.”

In recent years, the meat industry has rolled out many “post hoc” treatments to curtail meat pathogens—from the ammonia puffs used to make “pink slime,” to irradiation, chlorine, carbon monoxide and of course antibiotic sprays. Yet, “it is a bad way to do business,” the official told us, because different meats and different pathogens require different treatments.

Clearly there’s a lot wrong at FSIS that needs to be fixed. Similar corruption and product adulteration was seen with early alcohol production, our source told us. But the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives was eventually able to rid the agency of industry lobbyists and influence.

FSIS needs to do the same.

Meanwhile, working at FSIS to protect the food supply can be a frustrating job for those who want to make a difference “against all odds” said the FSIS official.

Scandals mount under David Bernhardt just two weeks after being confirmed to lead Interior,https://thinkprogress.org,[],,,,https://thinkprogress.org/interior-scandals-bernhardt-investigation-bears-ears-ethics-violations-b095ba71cea8/,"It’s been just two weeks since David Bernhardt was confirmed as head of the Interior Department (DOI), and already his tenure is mired in at least four controversies.

From the day he was confirmed earlier this month — despite uproar from Democrats over his conflicts of interest and a prior career as an oil and gas lobbyist — Bernhardt has faced a wave of scandals.

The Interior Department’s watchdog is currently investigating Bernhardt over ethics concerns, along with a half-dozen other DOI senior officials. Those investigations come as the department faces renewed scrutiny over its decisions regarding Bears Ears, the Utah national monument dramatically reduced by Bernhardt’s equally scandal-ridden predecessor, Ryan Zinke.

And on Thursday, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) called for yet another investigation, this time into the department’s record-keeping, arguing Bernhardt’s daily schedule is not being fully documented and that controversial meetings are “intentionally” being left off the calendar.

“Under Bernhardt, the command appears to be granting favors to extractive industries, science be damned, while fighting tooth and nail to keep the public in the dark,” said Jesse Prentice-Dunn, policy director for the Center for Western Priorities, in an email to ThinkProgress on Thursday.

Earlier this week, the department’s Office of Inspector General (OIG) confirmed an investigation into potential ethics violations by six senior DOI officials. The decision came in response to a request by the nonpartisan watchdog group Campaign Legal Center, which requested in February that certain DOI staffers face a probe over potentially violating an ethics pledge due to interactions with former employers and clients.

The deputy inspector for the OIG, Mary L. Kendall, said that her office will look into “potential ethics violations committed by multiple Department of Interior senior executives.” The Campaign Legal Center named current Interior officials Benjamin Cassidy, Lori Mashburn, Doug Domenech, Todd Wynn, and Timothy Williams in its complaint. Vincent DeVito, a sixth person named, left the department in August and joined an offshore oil and gas company.

The complaints against the six officials vary, but all relate to their former employers. Cassidy, a former National Rifle Association (NRA) lobbyist, has been called out for his ongoing work on gun-related issues, including on projects backed by the NRA. Mashburn, a former employee of the right-wing Heritage Foundation, is criticized for staying in close touch with the think tank since leaving. Meanwhile, exchanges show Domenech met with representatives from the Texas Public Policy Foundation (TPPF), another think tank that has actively downplayed climate change.

Domenech, who is currently assistant secretary for insular and international affairs, previously worked for the Koch-backed right-wing think tank, which has notched political victories under the Trump administration. DeVito and Wynn similarly engaged with former employers or clients while acting in their capacity as DOI officials.

Senior political appointees are largely limited in the interactions they are allowed with former employers under an ethics pledge imposed by President Donald Trump. The investigation into the DOI staffers will examine whether they are in violation of those limitations.

Bernhardt is similarly accused of breaching that ethics pledge. The Interior secretary, known for carrying around a card listing all of his conflicts of interest, is under investigation in relation to at least seven different complaints, according to an OIG letter sent April 15 to Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR). That probe was launched four days after the Senate voted to confirm Bernhardt, 56 to 41, largely along party lines.

It is unclear what the full scope of the complaints entail, but Wyden and Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-HI) had both pushed for an investigation into Bernhardt’s role in blocking an assessment examining the impact of pesticides on certain endangered species. Bernhardt has previously lobbied on behalf of agribusiness and against endangered species protections.

Recent disclosures have also shown that Bernhardt continued working on policies at DOI that would help his former lobbying clients, despite the Trump administration’s ethics pledge. That work includes shaping certain water policies despite lobbying on them previously while working for California farmers.

He has similarly strayed from the practice of maintaining a detailed daily calendar, instead having staff overwrite a Google document daily, erasing its previous content in the process, which watchdog organizations have worried is eroding transparency.

CREW wrote to Deputy Inspector General Kendall on April 25 urging an investigation. In its complaint, the watchdog group noted that there may be a possible link between the already-opened ethics investigation and the apparently deliberate record-keeping violations, “which appear designed in part to shield from public view and congressional scrutiny his contacts with industry lobbyists.”

DOI has argued that Bernhardt “is in complete compliance with his ethics agreement” and has followed department policy. But Democratic lawmakers and environmental groups are skeptical of the Interior secretary, as well as other senior-level officials at DOI.

“The fish rots from the head,” wrote Wyden in a tweet this week responding to the two investigations.

Chris Saeger, executive director for the nonprofit Western Values Project, told ThinkProgress on Thursday that Bernhardt’s “special interest conflicts are longer than a CVS receipt” and that his leadership at DOI has already been disconcerting for public lands advocates.

“Preventing the rot of corruption within America’s largest land managing agency will clearly require vigilant oversight and enforcement outside of the department’s leadership,” Saeger said, arguing that ongoing scandals and ethics lapses at DOI have come “at the expense of America’s outdoor heritage.”

Bernhardt’s critics are drawing comparisons to Zinke, who announced his exit from the department in December in the midst of more than a dozen scandals relating to spending and ethics violations.

But Zinke’s policy legacy is also living on under Bernhardt. One of the former secretary’s most controversial actions as secretary remains the decision to dramatically shrink Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante, two Utah national monuments, the largest reduction in U.S. history. Documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) have shown that oil and gas drilling opportunities played a major role in the decision to reduce the monuments.

The decision was widely panned by indigenous tribes, along with environmental groups and public lands advocates. But their opposition remains unnoticed by DOI. Last Friday, the department’s Bureau of Land Management (BLM), released the names of the 15 committee members selected to provide guidance on managing Bears Ears — the list included only critics of the monument.

That move has been slammed as “political” by tribal groups, who say the Trump administration is willfully ignoring the wishes of native communities. Supporters of Bears Ears applied, but none were chosen.

Bernhardt’s critics have pointed to that development as yet another indicator that the new secretary will be much like his predecessor, in policy as much as in scandal. Prentice-Dunn argued that Bernhardt has “established a track record of helping his former clients in the drilling and mining industries,” in keeping with the legacy set by Zinke.

Moreover, Prentice-Dunn said, with investigations mounting so early in his tenure, Bernhardt “is already on track to be as scandal-plagued as his predecessor… if not more so.”"
"Ocasio-Cortez claim that Trump wants to privatize VA is 'nonsense,' VA secretary tells Fox",https://www.foxnews.com,['Victor Garcia'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/va-secretary-says-rep-ocasio-cortezs-claim-trump-wants-to-privatize-va-is-nonsense,"Secretary of Veterans Affairs Robert Wilkie struck back at Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., on Wednesday, calling her accusations that the Trump administration wants to privatize the VA ""nonsense.""

""I won't be rude to the congresswoman and say that it is nonsense, but I will say it's nonsense,"" Wilkie said on ""Fox News @ Night with Shannon Bream.""

""If we are privatizing VA, we are going about it in a very strange way,"" Wilkie said. ""I presented to the Congress a $220 billion budget, the largest budget in the history of the department. We are undergoing basic reforms to make the VA a modern, 21st-century health care administration. But what we are doing is opening the aperture on choice, so that our veterans remain at the center their own health care, and if VA can provide what they need, we will give them the opportunity to go out into the private sector.""

VA SECRETARY WARNS TRUMP'S SIGNATURE PROGRAM COULD COLLAPSE WITHOUT FIX

Ocasio-Cortez claimed during a New York town hall event last week that the VA “isn’t broken” despite the scandals that have plagued the agency over the last decade and claimed the Trump administration aimed to ""privatize"" health care for veterans.

""That is the opening approach we have seen when it comes to privatization, it's the idea that this thing that isn’t broken, this thing that provides some of the highest quality care to our veterans somehow needs to be fixed, optimized, tinkered with until we don’t even recognize it anymore,"" Ocasio-Cortez said, in comments first reported by the Washington Examiner.

""They are trying to fix the VA for pharmaceutical companies, they are trying to fix the VA for insurance corporations, and, ultimately they are trying to fix the VA for a for-profit health care industry that does not put people or veterans first,"" Ocasio-Cortez said.

“And so we have a responsibility to protect it.”

The congresswoman's comments were aimed at Trump administration efforts to expand choice and private health care options in the VA health care system.

President Trump reacted to the congresswoman's comments by taking credit for turning around the VA.

""Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is correct, the VA is not broken, it is doing great. But that is only because of the Trump Administration. We got Veterans Choice & Accountability passed,"" Trump tweeted.

Wilkie defended the Trump administration and supported the president's response on Twitter.

""The other part of our comments or they were answered by the president, who said that under this administration, the VA isn't broken. The scandals that she referred to happened in another administration,"" Wilkie said.

""I can say, as someone who's been accused of being a historian, no president in the post-World War II era has put the veterans at the center of his campaign and administration until President Trump did it. We are seeing this in the way the VA's moving forward.""

(Jim Lo Scalzo/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock)

The main lobby of the State Department throbbed with music Friday. “Happy” by Pharrell boomed out of a loudspeaker on the wall of the cavernous space where coveys of suited diplomats scurry past rows of national flags, followed by the voice of Bruno Mars singing “Uptown Funk.”

Then Secretary of State Mike Pompeo made his way through a small throng of employees and scaled a stairway to a lectern near a giant placard hanging from a wall covered by a blue cloth awaiting a theatrical reveal. It was an unusual event, marking Pompeo’s first anniversary at the agency, and seemed to reflect his vision of leadership instilled in him at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point in N.Y.

But the splashy atmosphere surrounding the unveiling of Pompeo’s new “Professional Ethos” was more dramatic than the ethos itself, a nine-sentence statement that begins, “I am a champion of American diplomacy.”

[On the road to swagger: A year defending Trump’s worldview]

Many of the concepts in the ethos are already embedded in the State Department’s official mission statement, common human resources values or just the Golden Rule — professionalism, accountability, honesty and respect. Pompeo said they had been working on it since last fall, and the final product was preceded by more than 30 drafts.

“Never forget who it is that we work for,” he said, explaining what it means to protect the American people. “Their interests, not ours. Not yours.”

“It’s about disagreeing without being uncivil,” he said of professionalism.

Respect is about showing “unfailing respect for each other,” he said. “Simply because we are all human beings created by God.”

Pompeo acknowledged some of the people listening were probably wondering whether anything would change because of the short ethos statement.

“I think by highlighting the principles in this ethos, we can encourage each other and hold each responsible to these standards and take it to a new level,” he said.

He announced a new Ethos Award would be handed out later this year to the State Department employee who best incorporates the values. But it is impossible to know how many employees actually heard his remarks. The lobby was less than half full, but most would have listened on a closed circuit channel broadcast in the building.

After finishing his 15-minute speech, Pompeo lingered to shake hands with employees and pose for photos and selfies taken by some of the 75 members of the newest class of fledgling diplomats to complete classes at the Foreign Service Institute."

Department of Labor appeals ruling against 'Trumpcare' plans,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],04-26-2019,2019,4,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/healthcare/department-of-labor-appeals-ruling-against-trumpcare-plans,"The Department of Labor on Friday filed notice that it will appeal a ruling by a federal judge that struck down a Trump administration rule letting individuals and small businesses pool together to buy health insurance.

The decision on March 28 by U.S. District Judge John Bates, an appointee of former President George W. Bush, threatens a program the Trump administration created for customers to use as an escape hatch from high Obamacare premiums.

The administration will be appealing in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.

The notice filed by the Department of Labor did not say whether the Trump administration is asking for a stay on the decision, meaning that people may be left in the lurch regarding their health insurance coverage. Bates in his opinion asked the Department of Labor to state whether any part of the rule could still stand.

In his ruling, Bates concluded that the Trump administration's rules were ""clearly an end-run around"" Obamacare and agreed with the 11 states and District of Columbia that had challenged the rules, saying they also violated the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or ERISA.

The health insurance alternatives are known ""association health plans,"" and they let people who are self-employed or who are in small businesses act as a large business for the purpose of buying medical coverage.

Obamacare had ended the plans to encourage more people to go into its exchanges and also because past plans had become insolvent, leaving people holding the bag for costly medical expenses.

But the Trump administration had tried to reinstate them through rulemaking, and they are already up and running in many states: Health insurers have been allowed to run the plans since September 2018, and association-created coverage was only allowed beginning in January 2019. New associations that form were supposed to kick off in April.

At least one state — Vermont — has asked for the plans to be halted entirely as the case is litigated. States are otherwise allowed to put their own restrictions on association health plans.

Association health plans have been covering the same benefits that Obamacare plans do, even though they are not obligated to, according to analyses by the industry publication Modern Healthcare and another by AssociationHealthPlans.com.

But critics have warned that it is too early to conclude these benefits would remain. Unlike Obamacare, the plans are allowed to charge people more based on their health status, and prices could increase for next year. People who have pre-existing conditions, such as cancer or diabetes, can be asked to pay higher premiums that lead them to be priced out of the plans entirely."

The Department of Homeland Security's proposed policy to work around the courts could speed up deportations for recent arrivals at the border. | Herika Martinez/AFP/Getty Images Immigration DHS draft proposal would speed deportations

The Homeland Security Department is weighing a plan to bypass immigration courts and remove undocumented immigrants who cannot prove they’ve been present continuously in the U.S. for two years or more.

The proposal is described in a draft regulatory notice, according to two DHS officials and a third person familiar with the planning. If finalized, it would represent the latest escalation of President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown.

Story Continued Below

The administration has considered since 2017 expanding a fast-track deportation procedure known as “expedited removal,” but thus far has refrained from moving ahead.

The draft notice — which remains under review — would increase significantly the number of recently arrived undocumented immigrants subject to rapid deportation. Under the current standard, expedited removal is applicable only to immigrants picked up within 14 days of arrival. The two-week cutoff stems from a 2004 regulatory change, not from the 1996 statute that created the process.

The change could speed up the deportation of recent arrivals at the border and reduce the load on federal immigration courts, which have grappled with a soaring case backlog. But such a move likely would draw legal challenges — and a number of Trump polices have been sidelined by federal courts.

The planned regulation also would remove a current requirement to apply expedited removal only to undocumented immigrants arrested within 100 miles of a land border, according to the two DHS officials.

Instead, expedited removal would be applied nationwide, the officials said — giving it the potential to sweep up undocumented immigrants in communities across the country.

The constitutionality of expedited removal has been challenged in federal courts. In March, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit ruled that asylum seekers have the right to seek federal judicial review of an expedited removal order. That ruling conflicted with a 2016 decision by a separate federal appeals court."

Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue is moving forward with plans to relocate two influential scientific agencies out of downtown Washington, a cost-saving initiative that critics fear could provoke mass resignations among employees who perform critical agricultural research and produce statistics that shape farm policy.

In a meeting last week, Chris Hartley, acting administrator of the Agriculture Department’s Economics Research Service, told researchers at that agency to expect reassignment letters in mid-May, according to two ERS employees who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.

Although the new location has yet to be announced, Hartley told researchers that they would have about 120 days to uproot their families and report for duty. Of 68 towns and cities in contention to host the agency, College Park and Montgomery County, Md., are within a few dozen miles of its current offices. Many candidates, such as Denver, Des Moines and Kansas City, are hundreds or more than a thousand miles away.

Staff at the National Institute for Food and Agriculture, which Perdue also selected for relocation, haven’t received a date for the move, said a NIFA employee who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the person wasn’t authorized to discuss the move.

The relocation plan was unveiled in August, a prelude to the broad restructuring of the USDA workforce that Perdue announced this month, dubbed “OneNeighborhood.” Among other provisions, it seeks to consolidate USDA employees, moving them out of rented space across the capital region and into two department-owned buildings in the D.C. area that are undergoing renovations.

NIFA rents expensive real estate on the D.C. waterfront. ERS leases offices in the nearby Patriots Plaza. Under the OneNeighborhood plan, some NIFA and ERS employees would move into renovated D.C. offices, according to an April 19 memo obtained by The Washington Post. But the majority of employees at both agencies will be ordered to relocate to a yet-to-be-named site, which Perdue has said would bring them closer to farmers.

The plan has sparked an excited competition in the nation’s agricultural hubs, with nearly 140 businesses, universities, city developers and local economic councils lobbying to become the agencies’ new homes. But it has drawn fierce objections from Democrats in Congress, USDA employees and a bipartisan coalition of former USDA leaders, who fear the move would devastate the two agencies, which are already losing staff in the face of sharp budget cuts proposed by the Trump administration.

The NIFA employee estimated the agency has shrunk from about 400 employees to 200 since President Trump took office. “Every two days, somebody takes off” for another job or early retirement, the staffer said.

ERS is down from more than 300 employees to 250, said Sandra Salstrom, a legal representative at the American Federation of Government Employees, a union for federal workers.

Perdue’s office did not respond to requests to discuss the proposal. In a written statement, the secretary’s press office said the relocation plan is part of a broader “effort to make USDA the most effective, efficient and customer-focused department in the entire federal government,” arguing the move will “minimize costs” while bringing USDA workers “closer to all of their stakeholders.”

Past USDA chief scientists expressed “profound concern” in a letter to Congress, co-signed by more than 70 former USDA officials, university deans and agriculture scientists. “In a major relocation, there will be substantial staff loss because of either an unwillingness or other preventing circumstances to move,” the letter said. Signatories also worried that move could fray the close ties between these offices and nearby federal research agencies, such as the National Science Foundation, the National Institutes of Health and the Department of Energy.

“This parochial idea of, like, ‘Washington messes everything up. Let’s move it out of town’ overlooks the important role that this agency plays,” said Rep. Chellie Pingree (D-Maine), a member of the House Agriculture Committee who has introduced legislation to block the move. “There’s just a heightened level of concern about this administration, generally, about data collection and science.”

There is currently no chief scientist overseeing the research at USDA. Trump’s first nominee, the radio host Sam Clovis, had no scientific credentials and withdrew his nomination in 2017 over links to the Russia investigation. Scott Hutchins, the second nominee, was awaiting Senate confirmation when he was appointed, in January, as the deputy undersecretary for research, education and economics, a position that does not require congressional approval.

The nation has a growing population that needs to be fed, a climate that is changing and a “research process that is continuing to slide,” said Gale Buchanan, who was the undersecretary for Research, Education and Economics under George W. Bush and who signed the letter warning against the proposed move. “We are on a collision course for — I won’t say disaster — but we are on a collision course.”

The Economic Research Service is a statistical agency whose reports, such as its annual survey of rural America, influence policy and industry decisions. Its economists study subjects as diverse as avocado imports, farm labor practices and reliance on the national food assistance program, the latter of which is a frequent Republican target for budget cuts.

NIFA provides funding to researchers at land grant universities and other institutions across the country. It has funded agricultural robots, gene-editing crop science and even space worms — in January the USDA announced a plan to send nematodes, small parasitic worms that kill insects, to the International Space Station to test whether the worms can control pests in microgravity.

“A lot of us see NIFA as the core of USDA, in terms of discovering the knowledge needed for the future of feeding the world,” said Jack Payne, the University of Florida’s vice president for agriculture and natural resources.

NIFA grants also fuel research into agriculture and climate change, science the Trump administration rejects. It also oversees the 4-H youth organization. When NIFA recently produced a policy to support 4-H’s LGBT community, this caused “an enormous stink” in the secretary’s office, said the NIFA employee.

The USDA’s inspector general is reviewing the proposal to determine whether Perdue has the power to move the offices. Rep. Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.) and Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.) argued in an April letter that USDA lacks the budgetary authority and must seek approval from the House and Senate appropriations committees.

Congress, in its 2019 appropriations bill, told the secretary’s office to hold off on the plan, citing “insufficient information and justification” for the relocation.

The president’s 2020 budget proposal asks for $15.5 million to relocate ERS and $9.5 million to relocate NIFA. It also slashes ERS funding from $87 million to $61 million, and would trim the agency to 160 positions. The request would also eliminate research into food security and rural economies while keeping a focus on farm financial information, consumer data and trade. Congress ignored similar cuts proposed in 2018 and 2019.

In the fall, the USDA hired accounting firm Ernst & Young, for $340,000, to guide the science agencies’ relocation. Kristi J. Boswell, a senior adviser to the USDA secretary, told members of Congress the secretary plans to reveal the winning selection in May and, simultaneously, release a cost-benefit analysis.

“We have received stacks and stacks and stacks of support letters from senators, members of Congress, governors, community leaders, business leaders associations and local communities,” Boswell said during the March congressional hearing about the proposal.

Tim Daman, president of the Lansing Regional Chamber of Commerce in Michigan, said he was “pleased” that East Lansing is a contender. “Michigan is one of the most agriculturally diverse states in the nation,” he said, home to 50,000 farms, Michigan State University and a new dairy factory designed to produce 300 million pounds of cheese annually (nearly the weight, in cheddar, of two Washington Monuments). “The region is proud of our agricultural roots and the investment the industry has made in our community.”

Craig Beyrouty, the dean of the agriculture school at the University of Maryland at College Park, said his city’s bid would fulfill Perdue’s desire to move the agencies while keeping NIFA on the D.C. Metro’s Green Line. He said a new building could be erected in College Park within 18 months, but declined to provide other details. In addition to the location offered in College Park, the USDA owns 7,000 acres in nearby Beltsville, Md.

“There’s a huge amount of support to keep NIFA and ERS located in, or very close to, the Washington district,” Beyrouty said.

“From the perspective of what we actually do at our agency, we just can’t see any good reason to do this,” the NIFA employee said. “It just doesn’t really make any sense.”

EPA Decides Not to Regulate Fracking Wastewater as Pennsylvania Study Reveals Recent Spike,https://www.desmogblog.com,"['Bryan Walsh', 'Time Magazine']",04-25-2019,2019,4,https://www.desmogblog.com/2019/04/25/fracking-wastewater-disposal-health-pennsylvania-environmental-protection-agency,"On April 23, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) told two environmental groups that it had decided it was “not necessary” to update the federal standards handling toxic waste from oil and gas wells, including the waste produced by fracking.

State regulators have repeatedly proved unable to prevent the industry’s toxic waste from entering America’s drinking water supplies, including both private wells and the rivers from which public drinking water supplies are drawn, the Environmental Protection Agency concluded in a 2017 national study.

The corrosive salt-laden wastewater from fracked wells has been spread on roads as a de-icer. It’s been sprayed into the air in the hopes of evaporating the water — a practice that spreads its blend of volatile chemicals into the air instead. Oil industry wastewater has even been used to irrigate crops — in California, where state regulators haven't set rules to keep dangerous chemicals like the carcinogen benzene out of irrigation water.

If equally contaminated waste came from other industries, it would usually be designated hazardous waste and subject to strict tracking and disposal rules designed to keep the public safe from industrial pollution. But in July 1988, after burying clear warnings from its own scientists about the hazards of oilfield waste, the EPA offered the oil and gas industry a broad exemption from hazardous waste handling laws.

The EPA's decision this week echoes that.

“Rather than acting in the best interest of the public, EPA has continually shirked its duties and left our communities’ health, drinking water, and environment at risk,” said Adam Kron, senior attorney at the Environmental Integrity Project, one of the two groups that had asked the agency to consider its stance towards the waste. “EPA has known since 1988 that its rules for oil and gas wastes aren’t up to par.”

In the meantime, regulation has been left to the states — and the rules can vary widely.

Toxic Waste and Cancer in Pennsylvania

The decision comes as a new study, published in the peer-reviewed journal Science of the Total Environment, calls attention to the oil and gas waste produced in Pennsylvania for nearly that entire time.

The oil and gas industry has flooded Pennsylvania with over 380 million barrels of liquid waste from 1991 to 2017, that study found — enough to fill an area the size of a standard city block with a column of wastewater over 200 feet tall.

And that flood has been picking up pace. One out of every seven of those gallons was produced in 2017 alone.

A full 80 percent of the waste produced by the oil and gas industry in Pennsylvania stayed in Pennsylvania — or at least that’s as far as the Commonwealth’s reporting system tracked it.

“Pennsylvania also has the third highest cancer incidence rate of all U.S. states,” Environmental Health News reported, citing data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “Approximately half of all Pennsylvanians will be diagnosed with cancer at some point in their lifetime, and about one in five Pennsylvanians will die of cancer.”

Fifty-five known chemicals that fracked oil and gas operations release into the air and the water can cause cancer, a Yale Public Health analysis found last year. Oil and gas workers are routinely exposed to dangerous levels of cancer-causing chemicals like benzene, a 2014 National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health found.

Fracking has also been linked to asthma, low birth weights, and other health problems. “Our examination of the peer-reviewed medical and public health literature uncovered no evidence that fracking can be practiced in a manner that does not threaten human health,” a 266-page report by Concerned Health Professionals of New York and Physicians for Social Responsibility found in 2018.

Toxic and Radioactive

While many researchers have focused on just the waste from fracked shale wells (considered “unconventional” oil and gas), the new study looks at the wastewater from conventional oil and gas wells in Pennsylvania as well. The waste from both Marcellus shale wells and “conventional” wells can carry a wide range of pollutants and carcinogens.

“Radium is brought up with oil and gas wastewater for both conventional and unconventional oil and gas production,” explained Lee Ann L. Hill, who is lead author of the report and with the research and policy institute PSE (Physicians, Scientists, and Engineers) Healthy Energy.

Radioactive materials — for example, the radium isotopes associated with drilling — have been found in the sediments downstream from treatment plants, which are often ill-equipped to handle the blend of corrosive salts, trade-secret chemicals, and radioactive elements produced by the state’s oil and gas industry.

“7.6 percent of the wastewater over the whole study period, 1991 to 2017, was discharged to surface water,” Hill, an Environmental Health Program Associate, added. “That ended up being 30 million barrels.”

Tracking Toxic Waste — to its First Stop

In the absence of federal hazardous waste rules, which require stop-by-stop tracking of dangerous toxic waste, states are left to craft their own requirements for the drilling industry — and left to enforce them.

Pennsylvania is one of the only places that requires drillers to file details about their solid and liquid waste to a centralized public reporting system — offering independent researchers a chance to understand how much waste drillers produced and where it all went — or at least where drillers told the state about their waste.

But the data is still incomplete, and not just because it’s self-reported.

The Commonwealth requires drillers to report how much waste they produce and where it is shipped for disposal — but drillers are allowed to list temporary holding facilities — like wastewater “impoundments” or pits — in their reporting, without filing an update to show where the waste ultimately went.

“In addition, a third of the liquid waste across all years in the inventory lack a reported final destination,” the study concludes.

It’s a problem that appears to be getting worse in recent years. In 2017, 41 percent of the wastewater that drillers told Pennsylvania they produced wasn’t tracked all the way through to disposal, researchers said.

Multiple explosions have rocked the fracking industry this summer. One of which was sparked by toxic wastewater, not the oil itself. This is a big issue since fracking wastewater has grown 1,440% in the past five years.

And while drillers reported sites in Pennsylvania as the first stop for 80 percent of the waste, a significant amount has found its way into neighboring states like New York and Ohio, the study found.

Over 650,000 tons of solid waste from Pennsylvania's drilling industry was hauled into New York state from 2010 to 2017, the researchers found, including about 20,000 tons in 2017.

Roughly 31 million barrels of liquid waste was shipped directly out-of-state during that time, the report found, with Ohio taking 29.3 million barrels and West Virginia receiving 1.44 million barrels of wastewater from Pennsylvania.

“It really brings to light that there is definitely inter-state involvement when you talk about oil and gas activities,” said Hill. “It's not just isolated to one state — neighboring states are tied together when dealing with waste management.”

But at least for the moment, the Trump administration’s Environmental Protection Agency has decided not to step in, at least not where hazardous waste laws are concerned.

Representatives from civic groups who had asked the EPA to regulate responded in a statement.

“Disposal of waste from oil and gas operations is one of the biggest challenges the industry faces,” Barbara Jarmoska, board member of the Responsible Drilling Alliance, said in a statement responding to the announcement. “Failure to update rules for the disposal and handling of dangerous oil and gas wastes is an egregious dereliction of duty and an intolerable threat to the health and safety of American citizens.”"

Jared Kushner, in his first public comments since the public release of special counsel Robert Mueller’s final report, on Tuesday downplayed the effect of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, which saw his father-in-law win the Oval Office.

“You look at what Russia did, buying some Facebook ads and trying to sow dissent. It’s a terrible thing,” Kushner, who is also one of President Donald Trump’s senior advisers, said at a Time magazine event in New York. “But I think the investigations and all of the speculation that’s happened for the last two years has a much harsher impact on our democracy than a couple Facebook ads.”

Story Continued Below

The Justice Department, however, is offering a starkly different assessment of the potential dangers of a Russian intelligence operation to U.S. national security — and argues that it doesn’t take a master spy to do serious harm.

In a little-noticed court filing on Friday, an expert witness for the government, Robert Anderson Jr., a former assistant director of the FBI’s counterintelligence division, outlined how the activities of Russian gun-rights activist Mariia Butina during the election contained all the hallmarks of a sophisticated intelligence operation.

Anderson’s declaration has spawned a new fight between the government and Butina’s lawyers, who countered that it was speculative and blurred the line between informal networking and clandestine intelligence operations.

But the filing also sheds light on how the Justice Department views the ongoing threat of Russian attempts to influence American politics and goes well beyond what Mueller’s team was able to say in its 448-page report.

Allowing Russia to “bypass formal channels of diplomacy, win concessions, and exert influence within the United States” by entertaining backchannel lines of communication could result in “commensurate harm to the United States, including harm to the integrity of the United States’ political processes and internal government dealings, as well as to U.S. foreign policy interests and national security,” Anderson wrote.

Butina created a plan called the Diplomacy Project in March 2015 aimed at cultivating Republican presidential candidates and their advisers and reporting her progress back to Alexander Torshin, a deputy governor of the Central Bank of Russia.

She also tried to connect members of the National Rifle Association with Kremlin officials in December 2015 during a trip to Moscow, prosecutors say, and held U.S.-Russia “friendship dinners” to “exert the speediest and most effective influence on the process of making decisions in the American establishment,” according to a document she wrote during the runup to the election.

Butina pleaded guilty in December to conspiring against the U.S., agreed to cooperate with federal investigators and is in jail awaiting sentencing.

Butina wasn’t the only Russian trying to make inroads outside formal diplomatic structures before and after the election, however. And she was arguably the least successful.

Mueller confirmed in his report that Paul Manafort, the Trump campaign’s chairman, discussed ways to forge a Russia-Ukraine “peace plan” that would bolster Moscow’s influence over Kiev; that the incoming national security adviser, Michael Flynn, discussed sanctions relief with the Russian ambassador before Trump even took office; that Kushner suggested using Russian Embassy facilities to discuss Syria policy during the transition period, thereby evading detection from the U.S. intelligence community; and that a two-page document outlining a U.S.-Russia reset made its way from the head of Russia’s sovereign wealth fund to then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.

The first half of Mueller’s report was laser-focused on answering the question of whether Trump or members of his campaign had engaged in a criminal conspiracy with Russia to steal Democrats’ emails or influence the election through social media; it concluded that they had not.

Mueller had little to say about the broader national security implications of Russia’s efforts to cultivate Trump associates. But Andrew Weiss, the vice president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, where he oversees research on Russia and Eurasia, noted on Twitter on Monday that, seen against the backdrop of Anderson’s declaration, “it’s clear that the conduct outlined in Volume I of the Mueller Report created enormous damage to US national security.”

Seen against this backdrop, it’s clear that the conduct outlined in Volume I of the Mueller Report created enormous damage to US national security. Recall that none of what Mueller covers in the CI investigation requires mustering proof of a crime beyond a reasonable doubt. 17/ — Andrew S. Weiss (@andrewsweiss) April 22, 2019

Because the U.S. is Russia’s primary target “for malign and intrusive intelligence operations,” Anderson wrote, the Kremlin is not just looking for classified information or trade secrets. It’s looking for access points and opportunities to influence policy.

“In targeting the United States, Russia works … to collect any information that could, by itself or in conjunction with other efforts, assist the Russian government in increasing its geopolitical power or undermining and harming that of the United States,” he continued.

The special counsel’s counterintelligence findings could illuminate the extent to which people in Trump’s orbit — and the president himself — have been, or remain, compromised. But those findings were largely handed off to the FBI over the course of the 22-month probe and were not enumerated in the final report.

Butina’s lawyers, meanwhile, have argued that the broad theory Anderson put forward — that a foreign national may be acting as an “access agent” when hobnobbing with Washington operatives and sending information about those dalliances back to his or her government — “effectively criminalizes all networking behavior if done by a foreign national.” Her lawyers said in another court filing on Tuesday that it could take months for them to respond to Anderson’s declaration if the judge declines to strike it, indefinitely delaying Butina’s sentencing hearing. The hearing had originally been set for April 26.

Washington prosecutors have been aggressive in the Butina case, as evidenced by their assertion early on that she was trading sex for a position in a special-interest organization — an accusation that the government walked back after realizing that it had misinterpreted a piece of evidence.

Prosecutors also recommended an 18-month sentence for Butina, despite her lawyers’ expectation that they would not make a specific recommendation given the 10 months she’s already spent in jail.

Butina’s lawyers also feel the government blindsided them with the last-minute Anderson affidavit that made her look complicit in a Russian intelligence operation.

“The fact that the government used this filing — made late in the evening on Good Friday … less than a week before sentencing — to unveil a complete new theory of the government’s case creates additional due process issues,” they wrote in a motion to exclude and strike Anderson’s declaration.

Disputes over the government’s conduct aside, the Anderson declaration was a striking — and ominous — analysis of the Russian government’s intelligence-collection methods.

“Russia’s efforts targeting the United States take a myriad of forms — it is, in essence, a numbers game,” he wrote. “Not every intelligence campaign needs to be successful for Russia to have achieved its goals.”"

(Joshua Roberts/Reuters)

Three powerful House Democrats on Thursday opened a probe of the recent spate of firings at the Department of Homeland Security, which they called “unprecedented.”

In a letter to acting secretary of homeland security Kevin McAleenan, House Oversight Committee chairman Elijah Cummings, Judiciary Committee chairman Jerrold Nadler, and Homeland Security Committee chairman Bennie Thompson expressed concern that the firings had compromised national security. They also requested that “all communications related to the departure, or possibility of departure” of several high-ranking officials at the department be turned over by May 9.

“We are deeply concerned that the firing and forced resignation of these officials puts the security of the American people at risk,” the letter read. “We are also concerned that the President may have removed DHS officials because they refused his demands to violate federal immigration law and judicial orders.”

The lawmakers are specifically interested in the dismissal earlier this month of former secretary of homeland security Kirstjen Nielsen, former Secret Service director Randolph Alles, former undersecretary for management Claire Grady, and acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement director Ronald Vitiello, whose name Trump pulled from consideration to be permanent ICE director, saying he wanted to go in a “tougher direction.” They also requested documents related to two other officials rumored to be next in line for dismissal, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services director L. Francis Cissna and DHS general counsel John Mitnick.

Nielsen was forced out amid reports that she and other immigration officials had resisted several of Trump’s directives, including an order to restart the administration’s controversial family-separation policy and orders to implement other hard-line policies. Her dismissal and those of Alles, Grady, and other high-ranking officials were seen as empowering the White House’s most high-profile immigration hawk, staffer Stephen Miller, to push the administration toward the “tougher direction” Trump sought.

In their letter, the House committee chairmen demanded to see all communications between Miller and McAleenan, and said they were alarmed by Miller’s apparently expanded role.

“Moreover, we are concerned by reports that, even as he has removed the Department’s leadership, the President has sought to empower a White House aide, Stephen Miller, to ‘be in charge of handling all immigration and border affairs,’” the Democrats wrote, referencing a Washington Post report.

The White House said on Wednesday that Miller will not testify before Congress on immigration issues."

(Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post)

The number of people held in American prisons declined again in 2017, continuing a slide from that population’s peak in 2009, according to Justice Department data released Thursday.

A report from the Bureau of Justice Statistics states that “the number of prisoners under state or federal jurisdiction” by the end of 2017 had dropped to 1.48 million people, down from 1.61 million in 2009. The vast majority were held in state-run facilities, while a smaller share were in federal prisons. At the end of 2017, states held 1.3 million prisoners, down 1 percent from the end of the previous year. (Some states combine prisons and jails.) The report also touches on significant racial divergences, with incarceration rates among black people far exceeding those for white people.

Criminal justice reform has been a notable area of bipartisan agreement in Washington, with President Trump last year signing a sweeping bill whose goals included reducing sentences for some federal inmates. The topic has united conservatives and liberals, providing an area of common ground among lawmakers and others who say the nation’s criminal justice processes are unfair, expensive and otherwise significantly flawed.

[Trump administration’s proposed hiring requirement undermines criminal justice reform, bipartisan group of senators says]

“The declines in prison and jail populations reported by the Department of Justice today are encouraging, but still fall far short of what is necessary to end mass incarceration anytime soon,” Marc Mauer, executive director of the Sentencing Project, an advocacy group that promotes reform, said in a statement.

According to the Sentencing Project, five states — New York, New Jersey, Alaska, Connecticut and Vermont — have cut their prison populations by at least 30 percent in the past two decades, a reduction the group attributed to “a mix of changes in policy and practice” in those jurisdictions.

Mauer said in his statement that the drops in prison populations were “heavily influenced by a handful of states” significantly reducing the number of prisoners they held, while a number of other states either saw modest declines or increases.

“In order to achieve significant reductions policymakers will need to scale back excessive sentencing for all offenses, a key factor which distinguishes the U.S. from other nations,” he said.

[Who are the people in federal prison for drug crimes?]

The overwhelming majority of the overall prison population by the end of 2017 included people sentenced to more than one year; this group accounted for 97 percent of all prisoners, with the rest either sentenced to less time or awaiting sentencing.

This new report shows that the imprisonment rate — which looks at the number of people sentenced to more than one year per 100,000 U.S. residents — had dropped to its lowest figure in two decades. There were 440 prisoners facing such sentences in state or federal prisons per 100,000 U.S. residents, the lowest since 1997, when the rate was 444 per 100,000.

The data released Thursday also provides a glimpse of who makes up the country’s imprisoned population. Seven percent of the prison population was female. More than a tenth — 12 percent — was 55 or older. “Non-

citizens made up roughly the same portion of the prison population (7.6 percent) as of the general population in the U.S.,” the report states.

[The painful price of aging in prison]

This report highlighted stark racial disparities in the prison population.

While the overall imprisonment rate was down, among black women (92 per 100,000 black female residents) it was nearly twice as high as among white women (49 per 100,000 white female residents), the data showed. The imprisonment rate for black men (2,336 per 100,000 black male U.S. residents) was almost six times the rate for white men (397 per 100,000 white male U.S. residents), the report said.

For younger black men, the disparity was even larger.

“Black males ages 18 to 19 were about 12 times more likely to be imprisoned than white males of the same age,” the report stated. “This age group had the highest black-to-white racial disparity in 2017.”"
"Trump Justice Department Goes After Seattle, Philadelphia Overdose Prevention Sites as ‘Crack Houses’",https://www.thedailybeast.com,['Zachary Siegel'],04-24-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-justice-department-goes-after-seattle-philadelphia-overdose-prevention-sites-as-crack-houses,"Two major U.S. cities are trying to open facilities to save drug users’ lives, but the Trump administration is trying to stop them, arguing the facilities are no different than crack houses.

Seattle and Philadelphia plan to curb overdose deaths by opening facilities where drug users can ingest illicit substances like heroin under medical supervision. So-called overdose prevention sites are part of a strategy that seeks to reduce harm from drug use. The facilities were first popularized in Western Europe and have made their way to Canada and now potentially the U.S. While controversial and seemingly counterintuitive, over 100 such facilities currently operate in several countries, and public health experts consider them a staple of a robust strategy to prevent overdoses. Even Vice President Mike Pence, when he was Indiana’s governor during an HIV outbreak, implemented a similar program to distribute fresh syringes to prevent new infections.

President Trump campaigned on ending the overdose crisis, but federal prosecutors appointed by his administration are thwarting cities from pursuing effective strategies. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein promises “swift and aggressive action” if any cities follow through on their plan to implement the sites in the face of a staggering overdose death toll that has led Denver, New York, Seattle, Boston, San Francisco, and Philadelphia to consider implementing them. In 2017, more than 72,000 people died from drug overdoses in the U.S. Among overdose deaths involving opioids, more than 28,000 were due to illicit fentanyl, an uber-potent synthetic opioid manufactured in clandestine laboratories.

While overdose prevention sites are no panacea, decades of research from Canada, Australia, and Western Europe demonstrate their effectiveness, especially in times of crisis. A review of the scientific literature finds that these facilities reduce overdose deaths, public injection, neighborhood disorder, and the transmission of blood-borne diseases like Hepatitis C and HIV in the communities they operate. People who use overdose prevention sites also see improvements in their overall health, and overtime seek out treatment and find a path toward recovery.

“ The only thing these sites encourage is safer drug use for people who are already using drugs and unable to or do not wish to stop. ” — social worker Brooke Feldman

Last February, the Justice Department filed a civil lawsuit against Safehouse, a Philadelphia-based nonprofit that plans on operating the country’s first ever overdose prevention site. The civil suit, also a first of its kind, is a preemptive strike that aims for the facility to be deemed illegal by a judge before it ever opens.

“What’s driving the lawsuit is our responsibility to uphold and enforce the rule of law,” the U.S. Attorney in Philadelphia, William McSwain, said in a statement to The Daily Beast. “ Possessing, consuming or otherwise sanctioning the use of these dangerous narcotics is clearly against the law in the United States.”

McSwain is referring to what’s known as the “crack-house statute,” a provision that penalizes anyone who manages or owns a building where drugs are being used. Violating the statute can result in hefty fines or jail time. Public health and legal experts suggest the “crack-house statute” was never intended to apply to medical settings where people are receiving services that Safehouse would provide, such as wound care, new syringes, and treatment referrals.

Seattle may soon find itself in the same legal bind as Philadelphia. When asked about a site in Seattle, U.S. Attorney there Brian Moran told city officials: “Don’t go there.”

“As the Deputy Attorney General has made clear, the U.S. Department of Justice will not stand idly by and allow consumption sites to open in cities across the U.S.,” Moran told The Daily Beast . Though Moran has not filed a lawsuit like his Pennsylvania counterpart, he calls the plan to do so a “logical path” were Seattle to move forward on the proposed facility to be called Community Health Engagement Locations (CHELs).

The threat of a lawsuit looms large in the minds of Seattle officials like Mayor Jenny Durkan, whose office said she “thinks it is unfortunate that the Department of Justice would move to block a harm-reduction strategy to the opioid epidemic. However, we are not surprised and take these threats seriously. We continue to monitor the Philadelphia lawsuit while evaluating our legal options.”

Ronda Goldfein, an attorney in Philadelphia who sits on Safehouse’s board, told The Daily Beast that a court date has not been set, but that they are prepared to argue their case. “We have consistently maintained that an overdose prevention site, which includes a supervised consumption room and is operated for the purpose of saving lives, does not violate federal law,” Goldfein says. “We’re looking forward to the opportunity to present our arguments.”

Goldfein, also the executive director of the AIDS Law Project in Pennsylvania, sees many parallels between the modern day overdose emergency and the AIDS epidemic. AIDS activists put relentless pressure on the federal and local governments to fund research for treatment and invest in services like syringe-exchange programs that distribute sterile injection equipment to prevent the transmission of blood-borne diseases. The same way activists distributed syringes before it was legal, there are currently underground overdose prevention sites operating in U.S. cities.

“Among our challenges will be to address the stigma of drug use,” Goldfein says. “In HIV work, it’s clear that stigma continues to fuel that epidemic, despite medical and scientific advances in treatment and prevention.” Despite awareness around drug use as a matter of public health, drug users continue to be arrested and criminalized, she says.

The Department of Justice frequently argues that overdose prevention sites condone and therefore “normalize” injection drug use.

“Not only does the existing research on overdose prevention sites suggest that they do not encourage or increase drug use, but that argument just simply doesn't make sense,” said Brooke Feldman, a social worker in Philadelphia who has found recovery from her own substance use disorder. “The only thing these sites encourage is safer drug use for people who are already using drugs and unable to or do not wish to stop.”

A two-and-a-half-hour drive up the coast from Seattle is an overdose prevention site in Vancouver called Insite, which has been operating since 2003 on the Downtown Eastside.

“We know definitively there is a reduction in things like discarded syringes and public injecting upon the opening of these sites,” Ryan McNeil, a research scientist at the University of British Columbia who has studied the effects of overdose prevention sites. “You would think law enforcement groups would get behind that?”

“All these sites do is ensure that people who are using don’t die,” he added."
