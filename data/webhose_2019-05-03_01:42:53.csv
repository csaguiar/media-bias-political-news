McLaughlin & Associates revealed that Hispanic approval for Trump in March jumped to 50%. This number matched the January Marist/NPR/PBS survey that shocked cynics with its own 50% approval finding. Even if those polls are too aggressive, February's Morning Consult/Politico poll showed Trump's Hispanic approval vaulting to a still-impressive 45%.

The article goes on to argue that the primary cause of students fleeing the humanities for STEM is the difference in pay between liberal arts and STEM fields and the financial crisis of 2008. There are a couple of problems with that theory in my book: 1) Pay for majors in STEM fields has been higher than the pay for humanities majors for a long time, so why is that suddenly making students flee the humanities when it wasn't before? 2) 18 year olds entering college today were 9 year-olds when the financial crisis of 2008 hit.

He mentioned at one point that in order to get a PhD in Mathematics in the U.S., you generally need to demonstrate proficiency in Russian because so many of the important proofs are written in Russian. I asked him why Russians were so good at math. He pointed out that before the Russian revolution, Russians were producing the greatest literature in the world (Chekov, Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, Pushkin). He suggested that an important factor was that you couldn't offend the authorities with a mathematical proof. There was no communist mathematics, per se, so you were free to do pretty much whatever you wanted within mathematics. He suggested that this might have drawn all the best and brightest to math during the communist era.
Rigid ideology is the driving force in American humanities today. If we're looking for explanations for why students are fleeing the humanities for STEM, maybe a big one is that the political correctness that afflicts the humanities today isn't as prevalent in STEM fields."

A caravan of migrants is slowly making its way to the US’s southern border, and the anti-immigrant right thinks Americans should be afraid.
The migrants are traveling primarily on foot, fleeing a region wracked by poverty, corruption, and violence. Many are seeking asylum. Numbering somewhere between about four and ten thousand and likely to dwindle before they reach the United States, the group — which is largely comprised of Hondurans — has nonetheless been likened to a flood , an invasion , or even an army . President Trump is considering blocking their entry and has already deployed thousands of troops to the border. Paranoid right-wingers, imaginations running wild, are denouncing what they see as a plot financed by the billionaire George Soros , the Democratic Party writ large, or perhaps even Nicolás Maduro’s government in Venezuela.
For other observers, however, Trump’s reaction only underlines his administration’s appalling immigration record — family separations at the border, heinous treatment of young people in immigration detention centers ( including the rape of young women and girls by ICE agents ), and other acts of gratuitous cruelty that spur a never-ending stream of headlines — and adds to the urgency of resisting his policies. Civil disobedience acts are proliferating, and a handful of Democratic politicians with national influence are now sympathetic to activists’ calls to abolish ICE .
Such outrage is healthy, and must continue if the nightmarish treatment of migrants is ever going to come to an end. But the Trump administration’s moral failures do not represent as dramatic a break with American traditions as some might think. Central America has long been at the heart of US empire. And the dire circumstances that have driven so many to leave are tied to violent historical processes that the United States helped set in motion. The US Footprint
The history of US involvement in Central America reaches back at least as far as 1855, when soldier of fortune William Walker , born and raised in the American South, seized the Nicaraguan presidency by force. In his short time in power, Walker legalized slavery, declared English the official language, and launched an ultimately unsuccessful military campaign to conquer the Isthmus and transform it into a slave plantation economy modeled on the Antebellum South. After facing military defeat and deportation in 1857, Walker repeatedly returned until he was finally captured in 1860, handed over to Honduran authorities, and executed by a firing squad.
A few decades later, the United Fruit Company, a corporation formed in Boston, came to exert monopoly power over fruit exports and rail transportation throughout much of Central America. United Fruit dominated the production and export of bananas and other tropical fruits grown in Central America, squeezing smaller domestic producers out of the market and exerting poisonous political influence within these small, weak republics. The company kept prices low for American consumers by exploiting racial tensions between Central American and black West Indian workers to discourage unionization. And when strikes did occur, the company responded by enlisting the state to crush workers’ movements.
For good measure, US corporate executives bribed the local political elite, offering cash in exchange for lax regulations, minuscule tax obligations, and generous land concessions from the Central American public. While the region languished in poverty and economic underdevelopment, United Fruit grew in size and influence. Such blatantly corrupt practices continued at least as late as the 1970s, when reporters discovered that Eli Black, CEO of the company (by then renamed United Brands), had paid out at least half of a proposed $2.5 million bribe to Honduras’s president in return for reduced export taxes.
United Fruit did more than just buy off local officials. It worked methodically to destroy its political enemies. One such nemesis was Jacobo Arbenz , the democratically elected president of Guatemala. In 1952, Arbenz issued a land reform program that called for the redistribution of United Fruit’s fallow lands in order to cut poverty rates among the country’s landless rural majority. Out of respect for the company’s property rights, Arbenz’s plan would have awarded United Fruit financial compensation for its holdings (though this compensation would be based on the notoriously low valuations the company reported on its corporate tax returns).
Executives were outraged. Stoking McCarthyist fears of international communism, they lobbied the Eisenhower administration to overthrow Arbenz’s government. The Eisenhower administration invoked “rollback” of communist government, but also drew on an older foreign policy tradition — the Monroe Doctrine — to insist that the United States had a particular right to determine political outcomes in its “backyard,” particularly in the face of European intervention.
The argument that the Soviets backed Arbenz was ludicrous. The Marxist presence in the government was both homegrown and small, limited to just four members of the legislature, all elected in free and fair elections, as well as a handful of informal advisors to the president. But fevered anticommunist dreams won the day. Secretary of State John Foster Dulles and his brother, CIA director Allen Dulles — both of whom had worked as lawyers on retainer for United Fruit and still owned company stock — organized a military coup in 1954. The next three decades were marked by military rule, culminating in a genocidal counterinsurgency campaign against indigenous groups in the early 1980s.
And it wasn’t just in Guatemala. Throughout the Cold War, American policymakers’ fears of communism in Central America helped unleash violence across the region. Dismissing even center-left reformers as dangerous radicals, both Democratic and Republican administrations threw their support behind right-wing militaries in El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Honduras. Once empowered, these militaries repressed labor unions and social movements, and routinely resorted to electoral fraud, coups, and dirty bargains with corrupt civilian governments to maintain their grip on power. The violence they meted out — all with the imprimatur of the US government — helped ensure that Guatemala, Nicaragua, and El Salvador would remain among the poorest and most unequal nations in the Western Hemisphere.
Ironically, the repression of reformers helped fuel the formation of the radical guerrilla movements that American policymakers had feared. In 1962, in a major speech about Latin America, John F. Kennedy proclaimed , “those who make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent revolution inevitable.” His Alliance for Progress program aimed to support moderate reform movements that would blunt the appeal of radicalism.
Yet the year after his speech, Kennedy’s administration approved a right-wing coup in Guatemala to prevent the election of the anticommunist liberal reformer Juan José Arévalo. Officials in Washington feared Arévalo was too far left. Reasonably concluding that peaceful change was no longer possible, the Guatemalan left turned to armed revolution. A small insurgency metastasized into a long and bloody civil war.
The dark story of US intervention in Cold War–era Central America reached its climax in the 1980s. The Reagan administration showered the far-right military in El Salvador with economic and political support, and battled with a reluctant post-Vietnam Congress to do the same in Guatemala. Reagan also staunchly backed the right-wing contras at war with the new socialist government in Nicaragua, infamously breaking the law to do so. American policymakers sugar-coated such brutality with the language of democracy and nation-building. Reagan went so far as to call the contras — denounced by human rights groups for their torture and indiscriminate violence against civilians — the “ moral equal of our founding fathers .”
In a 1983 press conference in Honduras held after Reagan met with Efrain Ríos Montt, Reagan assured reporters that the Guatemalan dictator had received a “ bum rap ” from biased left-wing reporters and human rights activists. A truth and reconciliation commission later found that roughly eighty-six thousand people died during Ríos Montt’s seventeen months in office, the bulk of them civilians of indigenous descent at the hands of the military. Today, scholars now hold Ríos Montt responsible for acts of genocide . So did a court of law in 2013.
And while US supporters of intervention justified their actions in the name of nation-building, when the wars ended and the region was in dire need of financial assistance, the flow of funds reduced to a trickle. In 1990, two years before the country’s civil war ended, El Salvador received over $300 million in aid (about $600 million in 2018 dollars) from the US. In 2014, the year that unaccompanied minors fleeing the Northern Triangle first grabbed headlines, El Salvador only got $21.6 million .
Foreign aid has since risen, but because much of it’s focused on facilitating foreign investment through tax incentives, free trade zones, and further militarization of internal security forces, it is unlikely to benefit the impoverished majority. After the Cold War
More than two decades after the Cold War, American empire still looms large in Central America — and it isn’t just because of Trump.
When Honduras’s center-left president, Manuel Zelaya, was overthrown in 2009, Barack Obama’s State Department extended diplomatic recognition to the coup government, long before most European or Latin American nations. That decision lent much-needed legitimacy to the new regime, which proceeded to persecute progressive social movements and severely damage the country’s democratic institutions . The exodus of migrants from Honduras is a direct product of the violent environment the US-backed regime created.
Obama’s second great failure in Central America occurred in 2014, when the arrival of unaccompanied minors into the US spiked. The Obama administration ought to have dealt with asylum applications fairly. Instead, it deported migrants by the thousands. Many ended up dead .
As troubling as Obama’s Central America record is, the Trump administration’s may well end up being worse. While the modest economic development assistance provided by the Obama administration in the aftermath of the 2014 unaccompanied minors crisis was unlikely to alter the structural forces driving migration, Trump’s decision to dramatically reduce such funding (and perhaps outright end it) in exchange for even greater emphasis on counter-narcotics operations could exacerbate the violence.
In Guatemala, the Trump administration has supported moves by Jimmy Morales’s administration to weaken anti-corruption measures, after it was discovered that Morales had failed to disclose millions of dollars in donations to his 2015 campaign. Social movements in Guatemala have responded to Morales’s corruption with mass demonstrations in support of the imperiled International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG). The Trump administration, perhaps sensing a kindred spirit in Morales, has signaled support for attacks on CICIG and its mission to reduce corruption in Guatemala’s political class. Congress, egged on by Florida senator Marco Rubio , has suspended American aid to CICIG.
Then there’s Trump’s nativist rhetoric. The president has famously painted Mexican immigrants as “ rapists” and “criminals ,” and routinely conflates Latinos in the US with the MS-13 gang, even calling Salvadoran immigrants “ animals .” This odious language is more than just immoral — it’s dangerous. It whips up the ugliest elements of American politics and fuels racist nativism. In abandoning the dog whistle of past Republican politicians in exchange for blatant appeals to bigotry and hatred, Trump has poisoned the public discourse and endangered a wide swath of American society.
Trump’s rhetoric also downplays the extent to which Central America’s problems are tied to the United States. A hyper-militarized drug war, backed to the hilt by the United States, fuels violence. Propping up right-wing leaders that squelch democratic rule does the same.
Central America’s problems are not exotic issues beyond American influence, and refugees are not strangers from a distant, alien land. Central Americans live in the orbit of US power — they have for centuries. The world of inequality, corruption, and violence they’re fleeing is a world that American elites have helped build. To shrug off the struggles the region confronts today is to deny responsibility for decade after decade of neocolonial meddling. A Different Kind of Foreign Policy
Central America has long functioned as a testing ground for American imperial violence , a region where policymakers and military officials learn brutal tactics and strategies that they then apply elsewhere in the world.
But there’s no reason Central America can’t instead be the point of origin for a more humane, democratic foreign policy. The ballooning defense budgets that accompany American imperial projects weaken our ability to build a decent society at home. The violence engendered by these same projects weakens the ability of our sibling republics to the south and around the world to do the same.
The starting point for an anti-imperialist foreign policy is a simple principle: do no harm. When Central American reform movements emerge to create more egalitarian and democratic societies, Washington needs to get out of their way. When refugees arrive seeking asylum, the US should let them in. And if political violence erupts again, as it did in the 1980s, the US mustn’t side with the military and right-wing elites.
To create a better world, in which families need not flee their homes in a bid for basic personal security, American policymakers cannot close the United States off from the outside world. Nor should they continue to try to remold the world beyond our borders, like so much loose clay, in order to serve selfish political interests at home.
The moral imperative is instead to fashion a foreign policy based on the noble ideals of democracy, self-determination, and human rights that have inspired men and women across the Americas for generations. End Mark"

Said it before but, let’s revisit the wind scam again from the blog Watts Up With That? , If Solar And Wind Are So Cheap, Why Are They Making Electricity So Expensive?
Hirth predicted that the economic value of wind would decline 40% once it reached 30% of electricity, and that the value of solar would drop by 50% when it reached 15% of electricity.EP
In 2017, the share of electricity coming from wind and solar was 53 percent in Denmark, 26 percent in Germany, and 23 percent in California. Denmark and Germany have the first and second most expensive electricity in Europe.
By reporting on the declining costs of solar panels and wind turbines but not on how they increase electricity prices, journalists are — intentionally or unintentionally — misleading policymakers and the public about those two technologies.
The Los Angeles Times last year reported that California’s electricity prices were rising, but failed to connect the price rise to renewables, provoking a sharp rebuttal from UC Berkeley economist James Bushnell.

Watch a Trump cabinet official normalize extremism.
In assuring Tucker Carlson’s white nationalist fans that she and Donald Trump are in solidarity with their hatred of immigrants, Department of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen casually, but with enthusiasm, tossed out the possibility that Donald Trump might issue an executive order overriding the centuries-old interpretation of the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution granting citizenship to anyone born here.
In a deep dive into the legal consequences of such an order, Vox correspondent Dara Lind noted in October that Trump was toying with the idea. The 14th Amendment, stating that “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside,” was ratified i n 1868 . Issuing such an order, Lind pointed out, would be a dare from Trump to the Supreme Court to stop him. She described such a maneuver as “potentially … the biggest constitutional power grab by a president in a century.”
But to Nielsen and white power champ Carlson, such a radical maneuver is no biggie. In fact, Carlson tried to push Nielsen into saying Trump would agree to it. He slipped it into his advocacy for an expansion of the E-Verify program to “punish” employers of undocumented immigrants. Nielsen’s nonchalant amenability was chilling.
Of course, nobody mentioned that Trump’s own businesses have relied on such labor.
CARLSON: It looks like Congress is not going to act because one party has a vested interest in changing the population and the other party is, in effect, controlled by people who want illegal immigration. So would there be a downside for the president to act unilaterally on that question or, for example, birthright citizenship? Would you be willing to draft an executive order eliminating birthright citizenship?
NIELSEN: I think – you know, Tucker, I think the president’s been clear. All of that is on the table, including to close down the border. We have to stop this flow into our communities, we have to stop the drugs, we have to stop the smuggling, gangs. He’s very serious about it. So, yes!

The Real Reasons Why Facebook's Zuckerberg Wants More Government Regulation,www.zerohedge.com,Tyler Durden,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2019-04-03/real-reasons-why-facebooks-zuckerberg-wants-more-government-regulation,"
Authored by Ryan McMaken via The Mises Institute,
Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg wants more government regulation of social media. In a March 30 op-ed for the Washington Post, Zuckerberg trots out the innocent-sounding pablum we've come to expect from him:
I believe we need a more active role for governments and regulators. By updating the rules for the Internet, we can preserve what’s best about it — the freedom for people to express themselves and for entrepreneurs to build new things — while also protecting society from broader harms.
But what sort of regulation will this be? Specifically, Zuckerberg concludes ""we need new regulation in four areas: harmful content, election integrity, privacy and data portability.""
He wants more countries to adopt versions of the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation.
Needless to say, anyone hearing such words from Zuckerberg should immediately assume this newfound support for regulation is calculated to help Facebook financially. After all, this is a man who lied repeatedly to his customers (and Congress) about who can access users' personal data, and how it will be used. He's a man who once referred to Facebook users as ""Dumb F-cks."" Facebook lied to customers (not be confused with the users) about the success of Facebook's video platform. The idea that Zuckerberg now voluntarily wants to sacrifice some of his own power and money for humanitarian purposes is, at best, highly doubtful. (Although politicians like Mark Warner seem to take it at face value .)
Fortunately for Zuckerberg, thanks to the economic realities of government regulation, he can both support government regulation and enrich himself personally.
Those who are familiar with the effects of government regulation will not be surprised to hear a billionaire CEO throw his support behind it. Large firms with dominant market share have long made pace with government regulation because it often helps these firms create and solidify monopoly power for themselves.
Specifically, there are three ways that regulation will help Facebook. One: Regulations Will Give Facebook More Monopoly Power
Many Facebook critics like to claim that Facebook is a natural monopoly. That is, they think Facebook is so dominant in the marketplace, that it can use its supposed market power to keep out competitors. We're told that Facebook has so many users, no serious competition will ever be possible.
But remember MySpace? People used to say exactly the same thing that that social media platform. A recently as 2007, The Guardian was asking "" Will Myspace ever lose its monopoly ?"" Xerox corporation was once a tech powerhouse, as well. It has now all but disappeared .
Obviously, the answer to the Guardian's question is ""yes."" But we're now hearing about how Facebook is a monopoly. The reality, however, is that unless governments artificially erects barriers to entry, no firm can expect a safe place as a dominant firm. Other firms with new ideas will come along, threatening the older firm's dominance.
The answer to this problem, from the point of view of a firm like Facebook, is to make things for expensive and difficult for smaller startups and potential competitors.
Facebook knows that if government regulations of tech firms increase, the cost of doing business will increase. Larger firms will be able to deal with these additional costs more easily than smaller start ups. Big firms can access financing more easily. They have more equity. They already have sizable market share and can afford to be more conservative. Large firms can absorb high labor costs, higher legal costs, and the higher fixed costs brought on by regulation. A high-regulation environment is an anti startup, anti-entrepreneurial enviuronment. Two: Zuckerberg and Facebook Will Help Write the New Rules
In an earlier age, many might have taken Zuckerberg's new proclamation as sincere. Fortunately, we live in a cynical age, and even a beat reporter at Mashable knows how this game is played. Mashable's Karissa Bell writes :
It may seem obvious that Zuckerberg's proposal is self-interested, but it's important to remember that his ideas are, of course, designed to help Facebook....
And by touting the social network's existing work around political advertising and content moderation, Facebook has an opportunity to determine the rules the rest of the industry will also have to abide by.
Part of the reason Zuckerberg has made peace with the idea of government regulation is the knowledge that Facebook will be one of the most powerful groups at the negotiating table when it comes to write the new regulations. In other words, Facebook will be in a position to make sure the new rules favor Facebook over its competitors.
This is a common occurrence in regulatory schemes and is known as “regulatory capture.” When new regulatory bodies are created to regulate firms like Facebook and other dominant firms, the institutions with the most at stake in a regulatory agency’s decisions end up controlling the agencies themselves. We see this all the time in the revolving door between legislators, regulators, and lobbyists. And you can also be sure that once this happens, the industry will close itself off to new innovative firms seeking to enter the marketplace. The regulatory agencies will ensure the health of the status quo providers at the cost of new entrepreneurs and new competitors.
Moreover, as economist Douglass North noted , regulatory regimes do not improve efficiency, but serve the interests of those with political power: ""Institutions are not necessarily or even usually created to be socially efficient; rather they, or at least the formal rules, are created to serve the interests of those with the bargaining power to create new rules.""
After all, how much incentive does the average person have in monitoring new regulations, staying in touch with regulators, and attempting to affect the regulatory process? The incentive is almost zero. The incentive for regulated firms, on the other hand, is quite large.
Not only will a small start up lack the resources and political pull to challenge Facebook in the rule-making sphere, but those small firms won't be be large enough to be considered important ""stakeholders"" on any level. Thus, Facebook will continue to wield more power than its smaller competitors through its regulatory power. Three: It Will Limit Facebook's Legal Exposure
Another big benefit of regulation for Facebook will be the potential for using government regulation to limit Facebook's legal liability when things go wrong. Bell continues:
By offloading decisions about harmful content, privacy rules, and elections onto third-parties, Facebook may not have to take as much of the heat when mistakes are made.
Put another way, Facebook can protect itself form both the legal and public-relations repercussions to itself when it uses its platform to delete the posts and visibility of users with whom Facebook employees disagree.
As FTC commissioner Brendan Carr put it, Facebook's proposed regulatory agenda would allow it to ""outsource[e] censorship."" Not only would this put the federal government in a position to be directly determining which opinions and ideas ought to be eliminated from tech platforms, it would also allow Facebook to pretend to be an innocent third party: ""Don't blame us for deleting your posts,"" Facebook could then say. ""The government made us do it!""
Moreover, regulation can be employed by firms like Facebook to shield the firm from lawsuits. Potentially, in the marketplace, Facebook could be sued for using its platform to endanger domestic abuse victims, or victims of suicide. Whether or not the firm should be found guilty of such things would be complex legal questions decided on a case-by case-basis. However, regulation can be used to circumvent this process entirely, and serve the interests of large, abusive firms.
This phenomenon was explained by Murray Rothbard in the context of building regulations:
Suppose, for example, that A builds a building, sells it to B, and it promptly collapses. A should be liable for injuring B's person and property and the liability should be proven in court, which can then enforce the proper measures of restitution and punishment. But if the legislature has imposed building codes and inspections in the name of ""safety,"" innocent builders (that is, those whose buildings have not collapsed) are subjected to unnecessary and often costly rules, with no necessity by government to prove crime or damage. They have committed no tort or crime, but are subject to rules, often only distantly related to safety, in advance by tyrannical governmental bodies. Yet, a builder who meets administrative inspection and safety codes and then has a building of his collapse, is often let off the hook by the courts. After all, has he not obeyed all the safety rules of the government, and hasn't he thereby received the advance imprimatur of the authorities?
Let's apply this to the tech industry: Firm A is a new startup which has developed a way to make money in a way that satisfies consumers, and does not expose them to any unwanted harassment, de-platforming, or violations of privacy. Meanwhile, Facebook (Firm B) continues to use its dominance in the regulatory process to keep in place costly regulations that prevent new startups from making much headway. These same regulations, however, continue to allow privacy violations, and other abuses up to a certain threshold established in by regulators.
Thus, the outcome is this: Firm A is unable to deploy its new, inventive, non-abusive model at all because regulatory costs are too high. Meanwhile, Facebook can continue to endanger and abuse some users because regulations allow it. Moreover, Facebook enjoys greater immunity form lawsuits because it complies with regulations.Thus consumers are denied both the benefits of the new startup and legal remedies from suing Facebook for its continued abuse.
In short, Zuckerberg's pro-regulation position is just a pro-Zuckerberg position. By further politicizing and regulating the internet, policymakers will assist large firms - and their billionaire owners - in crushing the competition, and ensuring the public has fewer choices. Tags "
Report: Pilots Followed Procedures Before Ethiopian Airlines Crash,www.newsy.com,,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsy.com/stories/report-pilots-followed-procedures-before-ethiopia-crash/,"April 3, 2019 April 3, 2019 Preliminary findings show the pilots turned off the Boeing 737 MAX's automated flight control system but were unable to regain control of the plane. SHOW TRANSCRIPT
Pilots on Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 followed Boeing's emergency procedures before the plane went down, according to a new report out Tuesday.
Sources familiar with the probe into the deadly crash told the Wall Street Journal preliminary findings showed the pilots turned off the plane's automated flight control system but were unable to regain control of the plane.
Flight 302 crashed en route to Nairobi, Kenya, last month, killing all 157 people on board.
The crash has been compared to a Lion Air plane crash in October. That plane crashed into the Java Sea , killing all 189 people on board. Both planes were new Boeing 737 MAX 8s.
Officials have said they believe the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System , or MCAS, could have caused both crashes. As we've previously reported , the MCAS pulls the plane's nose down automatically if data says the nose's angle is too high. But if the sensor is wrong, the MCAS would force the nose of the plane down anyway — leading to a nosedive.
Boeing 737 MAX airplanes were grounded worldwide in response to the crashes.
The details about the Ethiopian Airlines crash released Tuesday are part of a preliminary report. The investigation into the crash is ongoing."
