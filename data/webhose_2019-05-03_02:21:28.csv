SPRING 2019 Paperback, 130 pages Racist Logic tackles how racist thinking can be found in surprising—and often overlooked—places. In the forum's lead essay, historian Donna Murch traces the origins of the opioid epidemic to Big Pharma's aggressive marketing to white suburbanites. The result, Murch shows, has been to construct a legal world of white drug addiction alongside an illicit drug war that has disproportionately targeted people of color.Other essays examine how the global surrogacy industry incentivizes the reproduction of whiteness while relying on the exploited labor of women of color, how black masculinity is commodified in racial capitalism, and how Wall Street exploited Caribbean populations to bankroll U.S. imperialism. Racist logic, this issue shows, continues to pervade our society, including its nominally colorblind business practices. Contributors not only explore the institutional structures that profit from black suffering, but also point the way to racial justice. Forum Lead essay by Donna Murch .

Justice Department threatens lawsuit over constitutional violations in Alabama prisons,thehill.com,Zack Budryk,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/437134-justice-department-reports-constitutional-violations-in-alabama-prisons,"Justice Department threatens lawsuit over constitutional violations in Alabama prisons By Zack Budryk - 04/03/19 11:18 AM EDT
The Department of Justice (DOJ) has found “reasonable cause” to believe conditions in Alabama prisons violate the Constitution's prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment, warning that it may file a lawsuit in response.
The DOJ’s Civil Rights Division and the U.S. Attorney’s Offices for the Northern, Middle and Southern Districts of Alabama launched a statewide investigation into prison conditions two and a half years ago and concluded the facilities have failed to protect prisoners from violence and sexual abuse at the hands of other prisoners and has failed to provide safe conditions, according to a report released Wednesday. ADVERTISEMENT
The report says these issues have been compounded by overcrowding and “serious deficiencies” in staffing and supervision.
The DOJ says in its report that the state's Department of Corrections (DOC) must take steps to accurately classify in-custody deaths. Public DOC reports indicate that between January 2015 and June 2018, 24 prisoner deaths occurred due to homicide.
The DOJ investigation identified three further, unreported homicides and numerous cases of deaths attributed to “natural causes” that were likely the result of prisoner-on-prisoner violence. One such case involved a prisoner who died four days after a knife fight and had multiple stab wounds to his abdomen, back, head and arm, according to the report. DOC records list his death as “natural” even though the autopsy report classified it as a homicide.
The report also found an “alarming number” of prisoners were killed by other prisoners with homemade knives. In many cases the victims had previously been non-fatally stabbed, indicating they were at risk for further violence, but the Department of Corrections took no steps to prevent further harm or death, according to the report.
“Our investigation found reasonable cause to believe that Alabama fails to provide constitutionally adequate conditions and that prisoners experience serious harm, including deadly harm, as a result,” said Assistant Attorney General Eric Dreiband, who leads the department’s civil rights division. “The Justice Department hopes to work with Alabama to resolve the Department’s concerns.”
The department warned Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey (R) that it may follow through with a lawsuit within 49 days after the issue of its notice.
“We appreciate the U.S. Department of Justice’s efforts to ensure open lines of communication with the State of Alabama. DOJ has identified many of the same areas of concern that we have discussed publicly for some time,” Ivey said in a statement .
“Over the coming months, my Administration will be working closely with DOJ to ensure that our mutual concerns are addressed and that we remain steadfast in our commitment to public safety, making certain that this Alabama problem has an Alabama solution.” Most Popular"
Private sector hiring falls to slowest pace in 18 months: report,thehill.com,slane@thehill.com (Sylvan Lane),04-03-2019,2019,4,https://thehill.com/policy/finance/437121-private-sector-hiring-falls-to-slowest-pace-in-18-months-report,"Private sector hiring falls to slowest pace in 18 months: report By Sylvan Lane - 04/03/19 10:12 AM EDT
Private sector employment rose by 129,000 workers in March, according to data released Wednesday, increasing at its slowest pace in 18 months.
The ADP National Employment Report , a closely watched gauge of monthly job gains conducted with Moody’s Analytics, showed a significant slowdown in hiring across several industries. ADVERTISEMENT
“The job market is weakening, with employment gains slowing significantly across most industries and company sizes,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics.
“Businesses are hiring cautiously as the economy is struggling with fading fiscal stimulus, the trade uncertainty, and the lagged impact of Fed tightening.”
Zandi also warned, “If employment growth weakens much further, unemployment will begin to rise.”
The lag in hiring is the latest sign the U.S. economy could be losing strength after more than a decade of consistent growth following the 2008 recession.
While the U.S. economy continues to benefit from low unemployment and solid gross domestic product (GDP) growth, a raft of inconsistent data on retail sales, trade, construction and spending has raised concerns about impending economic trouble.
“March posted the slowest employment increase in 18 months,” said Ahu Yildirmaz, vice president and co-head of the ADP Research Institute. “Although some service sectors showed continued strength, we saw weakness in the goods producing sector.”
Public and private sector economists expect U.S. growth to slow in 2019 after increasing to 2.9 percent last year. The Federal Reserve and Congressional Budget Office have both projected 2.3 percent GDP growth in 2019, which are in line with estimates from private analysts.
The White House Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) are far more bullish about the economy and projected 3 percent growth through 2024, the final possible year of President Trump Donald John Trump Tim Ryan expected to announce bid for presidency this week: report Kushner's security clearance was denied due to concerns of foreign influence: report Morgan Ortagus named as new State Dept spokeswoman MORE ’s presidency.
CEA Chairman Kevin Hassett on Tuesday said that the economy is “completely on track to have another 3 percent year” thanks to expected increases in output triggered by the 2017 corporate tax cut.
Hassett said that increased investment in productivity-boosting equipment and a tight labor market should propel the economy throughout 2019.
“The likelihood that the policies causing the boom right now getting repealed between this year and next year is close to zero,” Hassett said at a conference hosted by the American Bankers Association.
“The level of confidence that you’re going to have a pretty solid year is pretty high.”"
Kudlow: Trump administration looking at mitigating economic hit of possible border shutdown,thehill.com,Brett Samuels,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/437139-kudlow-trump-administration-looking-at-mitigating-economic-hit-of,"Kudlow: Trump administration looking at mitigating economic hit of possible border shutdown By Brett Samuels - 04/03/19 11:18 AM EDT
The top White House economic adviser on Wednesday said that the Trump administration is looking at keeping truck lanes open and assessing other strategies to mitigate the potential economic hit should President Trump Donald John Trump Tim Ryan expected to announce bid for presidency this week: report Kushner's security clearance was denied due to concerns of foreign influence: report Morgan Ortagus named as new State Dept spokeswoman MORE close part or all of the U.S.-Mexico border.
Larry Kudlow, chairman of the National Economic Council, told reporters that the administration is looking at ways to keep freight lanes open to accommodate trade should the border be closed.
He downplayed Trump's suggestion a day earlier that security is more important than trade, arguing the two are intertwined. ADVERTISEMENT
“It’s a hard thing. Issues about individuals and groups getting to work, I understand how hard that is. Tourism, I understand that,” Kudlow said.
“The trucking lanes and the freight lanes and all the supply chain stuff is really the key,” he added.
Kudlow said Trump has not yet made a decision on whether to shutter the border. He acknowledged that he has advised the president on the possible economic effects should Trump make good on the threat, but would not elaborate on specific data.
He said the administration requires help from Mexico and the U.S. Congress to make headway on the issue of border security. Asked how shuttering the border would spur Congress to take action, Kudlow suggested the action would underscore Trump’s commitment to addressing immigration issues.
“It’s an exclamation point,” he said. “It shows his seriousness. This is such an important issue.”
Trump last week threatened to close down the southern border if Mexico did not take steps to curb the flow of migrants into the U.S. He has since backed off that pledge, telling reporters on Tuesday that the decision to close the border is dependent on reaching a deal with Congress to pass stricter immigration laws.
Lawmakers in both parties have expressed concerns about how closing the border could impact the economy, as more than $1 billion in goods flow back and forth between the two countries daily.
Trump on Tuesday indicated he was unconvinced by the economic argument. While he acknowledged the likely negative effects, he said, ""Security is more important to me than trade.""
Kudlow stressed Wednesday that he's in agreement with the president's agenda at the border, citing recent statistics that show a surge in apprehended migrants. But he differed from Trump on the notion that the U.S. would have to sacrifice its economic gains for border security.
“I don’t think it’s one or the other,” Kudlow said. “In an important way the problems of border security in addition to the humanitarian problems, the drug trafficking problems, they’re economic issues, too.”"

Democrats introduce bill to let 'Dreamers' work for Congress,thehill.com,Jordain Carney,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/437137-democrats-introduce-bill-to-let-dreamers-work-for-congress,"Democrats introduce bill to let 'Dreamers' work for Congress By Jordain Carney - 04/03/19 11:13 AM EDT
Senate Democrats are introducing legislation that would make so-called Dreamers eligible to work on Capitol Hill.
The bill — spearheaded by Sens. Kamala Harris Richard (Dick) Joseph Durbin Warren, Booker reintroduce Dignity for Incarcerated Women Act Menendez, Rubio lead Senate effort to regulate Venezuelan sanctions GOP leader insists filibuster is safe as Republicans prepare to go nuclear on rules MORE (D-Ill.) — would expand the eligibility for a job as a congressional staffer or intern to include Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients, who came into the country illegally as children. ADVERTISEMENT
“The giant sign outside my office says ‘DREAMers Welcome Here’ because we know and value the contributions that these young people have made to their communities. But right now, those same young people are banned from giving back to their country by working for Congress. That has to change,” Harris, who is running for her party’s 2020 presidential nomination, said in a statement.
Durbin added that he has had Dreamers volunteer in his office and he had “seen firsthand how the people of Illinois would benefit if Dreamers could serve as paid employees in my office.”
“Many of them are dedicated to public service, and it makes no sense to deprive Congress of this homegrown talent pool,” he added.
The bill, according to a statement from Harris’s office, would apply to employment in both the House and Senate. Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick Ann Kirkpatrick Democrats introduce bill to let 'Dreamers' work for Congress Push for ‘Medicare for all’ worries centrist Dems GOP compares Ocasio-Cortez to Trump MORE (D-Ariz.), has introduced the legislation in the House.
The proposal is supported by a myriad of immigration groups, including United We Dream, the National Immigration Law Center and Unidos.
But any immigration bill likely faces an uphill battle in Congress, where the issue has emerged as a lightning rod during President Trump Donald John Trump Tim Ryan expected to announce bid for presidency this week: report Kushner's security clearance was denied due to concerns of foreign influence: report Morgan Ortagus named as new State Dept spokeswoman MORE 's administration.
Trump made hard-line immigration rhetoric a key part of his presidential campaign and Republicans on Capitol Hill have been wary of breaking with him.
The Senate previously voted down three immigration bills after the White House came out hard against a compromise proposal spearheaded by a coalition of moderate lawmakers."
Schiff says it's 'inevitable' Mueller will testify before Congress,thehill.com,Justin Wise,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://thehill.com/homenews/house/437132-schiff-says-its-inevitable-that-mueller-will-testify-before-congress,"Schiff says it's 'inevitable' Mueller will testify before Congress By Justin Wise - 04/03/19 11:06 AM EDT
House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) on Wednesday said that it's ""inevitable"" that special counsel Robert Mueller
“I think it’s inevitable that Bob Mueller is going to have to testify before Congress,"" Schiff said in an appearance on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe ,"" noting that multiple congressional panels may have an interest in Mueller's testimony. ADVERTISEMENT
""We’ll have an interest in his testimony or others on the issue of the counterintelligence findings. And the Judiciary Committee, maybe the Oversight [and Reform] Committee as well, might have an interest in other aspects of investigation.""
Schiff added that the intel committee has ""a statutory requirement that the intelligence community, FBI, brief us on any significant counterintelligence or intelligence activity.""
""And it’s hard to imagine something that rises more to that level than this investigation,"" he said.
The comments from Schiff came just hours before the House Judiciary Committee voted in favor of authorizing a subpoena to compel the Justice Department to hand over Mueller's full report on the probe.
The committee is also calling for the Department of Justice to hand over the report's underlying evidence.
Mueller finished his investigation into alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and Moscow last month. Attorney General William Barr
The letter noted that Mueller did not make a definitive conclusion on whether Trump obstructed justice. But Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein decided Mueller did not provide sufficient evidence of obstruction of justice to pursue it.
Barr's summary noted that Mueller did not exonerate the president on the obstruction matter.
House Democrats have called for the Justice Department to release Mueller's report in its entirety and set an April 2 deadline for its disclosure.
Barr told lawmakers last week that he expects to release the report by mid-April."

Trump Briefly Steps In 2020 Healthcare Debate Before Retreating,www.uspresidentialelectionnews.com,Nate Ashworth,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.uspresidentialelectionnews.com/2019/04/trump-2020-healthcare-debate-retreating/,"Trump Briefly Steps In 2020 Healthcare Debate Before Retreating Democrats welcome the debate on healthcare in 2020 By 0
Over the past couple of weeks, perhaps since the results of the Mueller probe were made public, President Trump pivoted his attention to the idea of Republicans being the “party of healthcare” and fixing the current system by replacing the Affordable Care Act. His party has been down this road before with disastrous results in 2017 as Congress failed to coalesce around a plan and the repeal/replace legislation that did pass the House was ultimately shot down in the Senate – by John McCain .
Having failed to live up to the promise of repealing and replacing ObamaCare, Republicans retreated in 2017 and quietly stopped talking about healthcare reform, until now, as the Financial Times reported a few days ago:
President Donald Trump is ploughing ahead with a plan to make healthcare a key focus of the 2020 election, worrying fellow Republicans, and elating Democrats, who believe the issue is a winning one for their party.
While Mr Trump said he would hold off on forcing any big healthcare vote until after the 2020 election — a reversal from just a few days ago — the president has continued to raise the prospect of “a really great” Republican healthcare plan, which would have lower costs for consumers than Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act (ACA). Such a plan, the president claimed, was already in the works in Congress.
“I think the Republican party will become the party of healthcare,” Mr Trump said in the Oval Office on Tuesday. “I see what the Democrats are doing and it’s a disaster what they’re planning and everyone knows it . . . Obamacare has been such a catastrophe.”
Well, the “party of healthcare” lasted about five seconds before Sen. Mitch McConnell put the squash on the President’s newfound policy push. It should be said that the pushback goes far beyond McConnell. For one thing, Democrats control the House and there is exactly zero chance that any kind of ObamaCare repeal legislation would make it through.
Barring some completely unseen and unrealistic bipartisan compromise on ObamaCare reforms, the issue is dead for President Trump until his party takes back the House or something drastically changes that motivates both sides into action.
Trump backed away from the healthcare push by making claims about fixing the system after the 2020 Presidential election:
“The Republicans are developing a really great HealthCare Plan with far lower premiums (cost) & deductibles than ObamaCare. In other words it will be far less expensive & much more usable than ObamaCare. Vote will be taken right after the Election when Republicans hold the Senate & win back the House. It will be truly great HealthCare that will work for America,” Trump declared in a series of tweets. “Also, Republicans will always support Pre-Existing Conditions. The Republican Party will be known as the Party of Great HealtCare. Meantime, the USA is doing better than ever & is respected again!”
That’s all well and good, but the chances of Democrats losing the House in 2020 are rather slim yet possible . Furthermore, as many analysts would point out, Republicans still have yet to come up with a workable solution that the entire party can get behind.
Nonetheless, the President tossed it out there, then took it back, and now Democrats will have the 2020 election to push their own ideas. Democrats Embrace Healthcare in 2020
According to public opinion polls, which beltway strategists and politicians on both sides pay close attention to, Democrats are winning on the question of which party is better at managing healthcare:
Polling data explain why Democrats believe healthcare will play well for them in 2020. Asked in 2018 exit polls which of the two parties would be better at helping Americans with pre-existing conditions, 58 per cent of voters said Democrats, while just 34 per cent said Republicans.
The 2020 Democratic field remains divided over how to approach the issue moving forward. Some candidates, like Bernie Sanders, have been very clear on a desire to completely eliminate private health insurance and move exclusively toward a single-payer European-style solution altogether.
Other candidates, sticking in a more moderate lane, have embraced various levels of the “Medicare-for-all” mantle, some which include keeping private insurance, some which include eliminating it, or some with a mix of private and public health plans.
The President’s decision to enter the healthcare fray has given cover for Democrats who remain almost as divided on the healthcare issue as Republicans:
In the meantime, Mr Trump’s focus on the issue helped shift attention away from the Democratic divide over “Medicare For All” — a proposal to expand the healthcare plan covering older people to all Americans.
While most Democrats believe that US healthcare coverage should be expanded, there are divisions over how to pay for such an expansion and whether Americans should be allowed to keep their existing private insurance.
“Anything that is able to tamp down this debate so it doesn’t become divisive for the party is good news for Democrats,” Mr Aaron said.
Healthcare was a winning issue for Democrats in 2018, and there’s no reason to believe anything has changed for 2020. The current system is a hodgepodge of problems as ObamaCare has been partially dismantled and insurance premiums and deductibles continue to rise which has left many paying massive monthly premiums.
Changing the system will always create new winners and new losers. Many consumers end up losing in the short term since plan changes mean different doctors and different networks which is very disruptive.
Healthcare is a touchy subject for both parties. Republicans have been unable to capitalize on the early unpopularity of ObamaCare and Democrats have been unable to push minor tweaks and reforms to improve it.
Healthcare in 2020 is stuck at a stalemate that won’t be broken until voters demand it and lawmakers can agree on some kind of bipartisan as a solution.
Are voters ready to embrace the “Medicare-for-all” push in 2020? Some Democrats are betting on it, as this guide from the Washington Post explains .
The graphic below separates the field into two groups. Those to have expressed support for “Medicare-for-all” and those who prefer something else:
The major Democratic presidential contenders have been vocal about the need to expand health-care coverage for more Americans. But they are split on how, opening a key policy rift in the 2020 presidential campaign, particularly over the most ambitious of these plans: Medicare-for-all.
Some Democrats have called for the United States to achieve Medicare-for-all through a single-payer system, in which all Americans would be enrolled automatically on a government plan. Other candidates have said that they believe Medicare-for-all is a good long-term goal, while stopping short of calling for a single-payer system. Others still believe in more modest measures to expand health insurance, believing Medicare-for-all could trigger a political backlash.
The debate over these plans — as well as their objective, details and impact on the health-care industry — is expected to play a major role animating the race for the Democratic presidential nomination.
The question will not be settled quickly or easily, and both sides will need to compromise. It’s incredibly unlikely that an overhaul which eliminates private insurance would be acceptable to a majority of voters, it’s simply too much of a change for America’s current system.
The 2020 Democratic field will hash this out and ultimately make it an issue that Republicans will have to respond to and President Trump will have to address during the campaign. TAGS"
