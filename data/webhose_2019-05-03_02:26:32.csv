"Taxpayer Schemes: How Some Tourist, Ecodevo Groups Win State Grants",timesexaminer.com,,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://timesexaminer.com/political/4828-taxpayer-schemes-how-some-tourist-ecodevo-groups-win-state-grants,"By Rick Brundrett - The Nerve Published: 03 April 2019
S.C. lawmakers are funneling millions in tax dollars collectively to economic development and tourism organizations in the state – with the requirement that the groups secure private matches for grants.
These types of “public-private partnerships” have been common in recent years in South Carolina, purportedly to ensure that taxpayers don’t pay most of the cost of promoting the Palmetto State to tourists or companies.
But an investigation by The Nerve of how the grants are awarded found that taxpayers are making up more of the “private match” than they’re supposed to be.
The grants are funded through two obscure state budget provisos renewed annually by lawmakers – one for the Department of Parks, Recreation and Tourism (PRT), and the other for the Department of Commerce. Neither proviso defines what constitutes a private match, or requires PRT or Commerce to verify that all of the matching money doesn’t include public funds.
The lack of accountability is apparent given that two of eight economic development groups that received grants from Commerce in fiscal 2018, which ended last June 30, listed contributions from state or local public entities as part of their private matches.
Moreover, four of five tourism groups that received PRT grants last fiscal year say they make their private matches through a special fee charged by hotels to guests. The tourism groups claim the fee is voluntary and transparent, but The Nerve discovered otherwise in a spot check of several hotels.
Combined, the 13 tourism or economic development organizations were awarded nearly $19 million in state funding last fiscal year under the provisos, which are a separate part of the state budget and usually receive little public attention.
The taxpayer-supported groups typically boast how they bring tourists or jobs to South Carolina, though critics contend that they often overstate their roles or can’t verify their claims. ‘Totally transparent’
In fiscal 2017-18, five tourism groups received a total of $14 million in “Destination Specific Tourism Marketing” grants from PRT, and collectively provided $28 million in required matches, for a grand total of $42 million, PRT records show.
Under the state budget proviso authorizing the PRT grants, the minimum award is $250,000, though no maximum amount is specified. Every state dollar must be matched with two dollars of “private funds,” which isn’t defined.
Following is a breakdown of the state grants awarded last fiscal year, according to PRT records provided to The Nerve: Myrtle Beach Area Chamber of Commerce: $6.7 million; Charleston Area Convention and Visitors Bureau (CVB): $4.1 million; Hilton Head Island-Bluffton Chamber of Commerce and CVB: $1.35 million; Greenville CVB: $1.1 million; and Columbia CVB: $750,000
The state grants are separate from state or local accommodation taxes that the organizations receive annually for tourism promotion, or from other public revenue sources. The Myrtle Beach Area Chamber of Commerce, for example, received a total of nearly $26.7 million in “local government support” in 2017, according to its annual financial statement.
Contacted last week by The Nerve, representatives of the Charleston, Columbia, Greenville and Hilton Head tourism organizations each said in written responses that participating hotels in their areas assess a room fee toward the private matches for the PRT grants. The Myrtle Beach chamber didn’t respond to questions about the charge.
All five tourism groups declined to release their lists of participating hotels to The Nerve, or didn’t respond to requests for that information.
In a prepared statement, Bill Ellen, president and CEO of Experience Columbia SC, said his organization raised matching funds last fiscal year “privately from about two dozen partner hotels that have a voluntary charge on each occupied room.”
“The charge is totally transparent to the hotel guest and can be removed if requested by the guest,” he added.
The group’s website says the “Destination Marketing Fee” is 2% on each room charge per night, noting, “At the point of check-out, the guest has the opportunity to pay the fee and applicable associated tax, or opt out upon request.”
The website implies that the match money won’t affect the bottom lines of participating hotels, noting, “No money comes out of the hotel budget.”
The site doesn’t say, though, whether guests are told up front that the fee is voluntary, or whether the charge is itemized on their bills.
The hotels are encouraged to participate, with “preferred partners” receiving “exclusive benefits beyond the standard partnership services,” such as “highlighted and enhanced” listings in the Columbia Official Visitors Guide, the site says.
Representatives of the Charleston, Greenville and Hilton Head tourism groups also told The Nerve in written responses last week that the fee charged by hotels in their respective areas for the private matches is voluntary and transparent.
Chris Stone, president of VisitGreenvilleSC, said in an email his organization receives “private investment from 30 local hotels that matches the State’s investment.” Charlie Clark, spokeswoman for the Hilton Head Island-Bluffton Chamber of Commerce, said, “All of our major resorts participate.”
But whether the fees are actually voluntary and transparent is questionable. The Nerve found in a spot check of a Hilton Head resort and two higher-end Columbia hotels that: The Hilton Head resort sometimes lumps in its marketing fee, described by two workers there as a “convention tourism tax,” with other state and local taxes. The fee is 1% of the room charge. When asked if guests are told up front that the fee is voluntary, another worker said $1.50 is taken off their bill only if they specifically request it. In Columbia, the 2% “Destination Marketing Fee” was lumped in with other state and local taxes under a single “taxes” heading on a guest’s recent bill. “It’s part of the room tax,” one worker there said, adding she was not “100% sure” that the fee was voluntary. A worker at the other Columbia hotel said the fee is itemized on guests’ bills, but when asked if guests are informed that it’s voluntary, she replied, “No … It comes on there automatically. You have to request it off.”
Under the budget proviso, tourism organizations receiving the PRT grants must “certify” that the “private funds are new dollars specifically designated for the purpose of matching state funds.”
PRT spokeswoman Dawn Dawson-House in an email last week said the grants, which go to “convention and visitors bureaus or chambers of commerce in larger tourism destinations,” are “awarded at the discretion of SCPRT’s Director,” who is appointed by the governor.
Asked how PRT verifies that the matches from the organizations are private, Dawson-House said, “It is part of the application that they state the source of the private funds.”
She acknowledged, though, in a follow-up response that the tourism groups do not provide PRT with lists specifically identifying each contributor and individual amounts collected for the required private matches.
Dawson-House did not respond to questions about the fees assessed by hotels for the private matches. Private money?
Another annually renewed budget proviso gives the state Department of Commerce $5 million to divide mostly among eight regional economic development organizations. Each grant requires a dollar-for-dollar match of “private funds,” which isn’t defined.
Following is the breakdown of the grants awarded for this fiscal year and last, according to state budget records: Central SC Alliance (Columbia-based, representing eight counties): $750,000; Upstate South Carolina Alliance (Greenville-based, representing 10 counties): $750,000; North Eastern Strategic Alliance (Florence-based, representing nine counties): $745,000; Charleston Regional Development Alliance (Berkeley, Charleston, Dorchester counties): $660,000; South Carolina I-77 Alliance (Chester, Fairfield, Lancaster, Richland, York counties): $600,000; Southern Carolina Alliance (Barnwell-based, representing seven counties): $460,000; Economic Development Partnership (Aiken, Edgefield, McCormick, Saluda counties): $450,000; TheLINK Economic Development Alliance (Lee, Sumter counties): $385,000
If the full private matches were raised, the total annual amount available to the eight groups would come to $9.6 million.
The Commerce proviso requires that the groups submit annual reports to the head of Commerce and chairmen of the budget-writing House and Ways and Senate Finance committees “on the expenditure of the funds and on the outcome measures,” though “outcome measures” isn’t defined. The PRT proviso has a similar reporting requirement.
Sen. Hugh Leatherman, R-Florence, who is the longtime Senate Finance chairman, sits on the executive committee of the governing board of the North Eastern Strategic Alliance, which is chaired by former state senator and ex-lieutenant governor Yancey McGill.
For the fiscal year that ended June 30, 2017, the organization listed a total of $2.3 million in contributions and grants, and about $626,000 in total salaries and other employee expenses, according to the group’s federal income-tax return.
Another Commerce grant recipient, the Central SC Alliance, said in its most-recent annual report provided to Commerce that it was “successful in matching $722,520 in available state funds” with private-sector dollars. But its list of 100 private contributors included public entities such as the University of South Carolina, Midlands Technical College, state-owned utility Santee Cooper, the S.C. Ports Authority and the S.C. Research Authority (SCRA).
Asked about the discrepancy, Tracy McMillin, a vice president with Central SC, whose board of directors includes the presidents of USC and Midlands Technical College, and SCRA’s executive director, said in an email last week to The Nerve that while the annual report does “list all of our investors, the “actual match does not include public sector entities.”
In a follow-up response, McMillin said that “going forward we will remove mention of them (public entities) all together” in the annual report to the Legislature and Commerce.
Central SC isn’t alone in blurring the line between private and public matches. A list provided to The Nerve, for example, by the Upstate South Carolina Alliance titled, “Upstate SC Alliance Matching Cash Contributors for FY 2017-2018,” includes the public Greenville and Spartanburg water systems.
In an email response last week about the discrepancy, alliance spokeswoman Danielle Besser said the public organizations were not supposed to be included.
“Those organizations were erroneously included in the report by a former staff member,” she said. “However, with those organizations excluded, our private funds raised exceeded the amount required to receive the state match requested for FY2017-2018.”
Four other economic development groups – the Charleston Regional Development Alliance, Economic Development Partnership, TheLINK and South Carolina I-77 Alliance – provided The Nerve with their lists of contributors for the private matches last fiscal year. None showed solely public entities, though several included the Palmetto Economic Development Corp. or its business name, the South Carolina Power Team.
The Palmetto Economic Development Corp. is described as the “economic development alliance of the state-owned utility, Santee Cooper, and Central Power Cooperative Inc.,” according to the organization’s federal income-tax return. On its website, the South Carolina Power Team describes itself as the “economic development organization of the state’s 20 electric cooperatives.”
The directors of the North Eastern Strategic Alliance and Southern Carolina Alliance informed The Nerve last week they couldn’t immediately provide their private-match contributor lists.
The state budget proviso requires that groups receiving grants must “certify that the private funds are new dollars specifically designated for the purpose of matching state funds and have not been previously allocated or designated for economic development.”
The Department of Commerce did not respond to The Nerve’s written request last week for specifics on how the agency verifies that private matches don’t include public funds.
The Commerce and PRT provisos are part of the House version of the approximately $30 billion state budget for next fiscal year, which starts July 1. The proposed state spending plan is now in the Senate. Any differences between the two chambers will be worked out in a conference committee before a final version is sent to Gov. Henry McMaster."

Jeff Duncan's Office Published: 03 April 2019 Washington, D.C. – Congressman Jeff Duncan (SC-03) signed the discharge petition put forth by House Republican Whip Steve Scalise to force a vote on the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, sponsored by Rep. Ann Wagner. “This debate isn’t about abortion—it is about ensuring babies who survive an abortion get the same level of life-saving medical care as any other baby. It’s disheartening that we are even at a point where it is controversial to take a stand against infanticide in Congress. The Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act should be the easiest vote to ever cast to stand for all life, born and unborn. The American people deserve to know where their elected officials stand on infanticide.” Background The born-alive law in 2002 recognized babies born during an abortion as “persons” but did not provide a duty to care for abortionists and health care professionals to treat the born-alive infant with the same degree of care given to any other baby. Congressman Duncan is a cosponsor of H.R. 962, the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act. Democrats have blocked Republican requests to vote on H.R. 962 twenty-five times so far this Congress. The House of Representatives passed the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act in the 115 th Congress with bipartisan support. Hits: 150"

Who Is Your Doctor?,timesexaminer.com,,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://timesexaminer.com/medical-opinion/dr-jane-m-orient/4823-who-is-your-doctor,"NOW WE AMERICAN PATRIOTS would never... 3 weeks ago. Who Is Your Doctor? By Dr. Jane M. Orient Published: 03 April 2019
People used to know who their doctor was. His name and phone number were on the wall or the refrigerator next to the telephone. He was there for you and could manage most of your problems.
When I was about 13, my mom took me to our pediatrician for belly pain. He was on his way out the door, but he stopped to take care of me. He diagnosed appendicitis based on history and physical examination. He called his favorite surgeon (“Billy,” a Tucson legend), who came from the golf course to meet me in the emergency room. Within hours, my red-hot appendix was in a jar. My parents paid the hospital bill ($150—10 days’ pay for a construction laborer) as I was discharged a few days later.
Today, the patient with abdominal pain could wait for hours to see the ER provider—possibly a nurse practitioner or physician assistant who had never seen a case of acute appendicitis. She’ll probably get a CT scan, after another wait. Eventually, Dr. On-call may take her to the operating room, hopefully before the appendix ruptures. And the bill will be beyond the means of ordinary people.
I used to be able to direct-admit patients from my office and send them with a set of orders to the hospital admitting office. For years, this has been impossible. The hospital is decidedly unfriendly to independent doctors. There’s now a gatekeeper in the emergency room, and most patients are under the control of a hospitalist.
This hospital, still Catholic at least in name, is now owned by a huge national conglomerate. Recently, it thwarted all efforts to keep it from dehydrating a patient to death despite lack of an advance directive or permission from next of kin. The patient’s mother disputed the diagnosis of brain death. The gastroenterologist of her choice was willing and able to place a feeding tube, needed in order to transfer the patient to a skilled nursing facility, but the hospital would not permit it. An outside physician whom the mother had called on was removed from the patient’s room by security, when she was merely praying with the mother. The mother could not get a phone call returned from an attending physician. Who was the doctor? Apparently, the hospital system.
Recently, a physician called me about her mother, who was seemingly a captive in a world-renowned hospital. She was concerned about her mother’s nutritional status and falling oxygen level. She could not speak to the attending physician. “They play musical doctors.”
Largely driven by government policy, the System is increasingly in control. A new level of intrusion is being proposed in California in a bill (SB 276) that would outlaw all medical exemptions for vaccines , unless a public health officer approves each one, based on the very narrow list of contraindications accepted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
Doctors traditionally swore an oath not to harm patients, and are liable if they do. But government officials are immune from liability, even if they overrule a physician’s judgment that a particular patient faces an unacceptable risk of harm from a vaccine.
If you disagree with your private doctor, you can fire him or simply decline to follow his advice. But what if the government is your doctor?
In Arizona, law enforcement officers in tactical gear broke down the door to a home where children were sleeping, entered with guns drawn, and took three little children away from their parents . The stated reason: the mother had decided not to follow a doctor’s advice to take her two-year-old to the emergency room for a fever, because the fever broke and the child got much better soon after leaving the office. The main concern seemed to be that the child was not vaccinated.
Americans need to defend their right to have an independent physician, to choose their physician and type of care, and to give or withhold informed consent to medical treatments. Otherwise, their “doctor” will be a protocol in a system staffed by interchangeable automatons. Treatments will be inaccessible or required, tailored to meet the needs and beliefs of the system.
If the government is the ultimate authority on your “health care,” remember that its tools for checking whether a child has a life-threatening disease such as meningitis include battering rams and assault rifles. Hits: 151"

Ask Your Representative to Sign the Discharge Petition on Born Alive Babies,timesexaminer.com,,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://timesexaminer.com/political/4820-ask-your-representative-to-sign-the-discharge-petition-on-born-alive-babies,"By Eagle Forum Published: 03 April 2019
House Republican Leadership is taking the charge on saving born alive babies. Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA) is filing a discharge petition this week ( H. Res. 102 ) to force Democrats to have a vote on the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act ( H.R. 962 ). This is a bill that requires medical professionals to provide healthcare to a baby who is born alive during an abortion attempt. In light of recent comments by lawmakers and legislation that has moved in various states, the time is now to protect babies!
Congress must listen to the American people. Polling shows that 77% of Americans support protections for abortion survivors and 62% are against late-term abortion. In fact, this bill has strong bipartisan support among voters with 86% of Republicans, 70% of Democrats, and 75% of independents supporting the legislation.Three Democrat Congressmen have already co-sponsored H.R. 962. We can all agree that this is a common sense bill that needs to pass immediately.
This discharge petition needs 218 signatures. If all 197 House Republicans sign on, only 21 Democrats are needed for this legislation to go to a vote. No matter your Congressman’s political party, they need to hear from you!
Please call or email your Congressman to tell them to sign H.Res. 102, the Born-Alive discharge petition!

Moscow Snuffs out Religious Liberty in Eastern Ukraine,www.cato.org,Doug Bandow,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/moscow-snuffs-out-religious-liberty-eastern-ukraine,"By Doug Bandow on National Review (Online) on April 3, 2019.
No surprise, the Soviet Union was one of the great religious persecutors. There is nothing more fearsome to totalitarian dictatorships than being challenged by those claiming loyalty to a transcendent realm that lies well beyond the political one.
The collapse of the Bolshevik state freed the Russian people to worship as they felt led by God. Russia, the largest successor state, suffered a huge spiritual and moral vacuum and drew in once-banned evangelizing faiths. Alas, that set up a clash with the Orthodox Church, which acted for many — including, it seems, Russian president Vladimir Putin — in claiming to embody Mother Russia.
That has led to an increasingly repressive campaign against smaller, more-vulnerable sects, which grow through proselytizing. Russia has effectively banned Jehovah’s Witnesses — arresting, imprisoning, and torturing scores of believers and confiscating hundreds of millions of dollars in church property. Mormons as well have recently been arrested (though deported rather than imprisoned). Although religious liberty cannot drive American foreign policy, U.S. officials should promote fundamental human freedoms when practical. Now is such a time.
However, persecution merged with politics even more brutally in eastern Ukraine, where Moscow backed local separatists. The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom rated Russia a tier-1 persecutor, warranting treatment as a “country of particular concern.” Reported the USCIRF: “Russia represents a unique case,” being “the sole state to have not only continually intensified its repression of religious freedom since the USCIRF commenced monitoring it, but also to have expanded its repressive policies to the territory of a neighboring state, by means of military invasion and occupation. Those policies, ranging from administrative harassment to arbitrary imprisonment to extrajudicial killing, are implemented in a fashion that is systematic, ongoing, and egregious.”
Many have suffered, in Russia generally, in Chechnya and Dagestan, and in Crimea. The USCIRF explained that “the Russian government views independent religious activity as a major threat to social and political stability, an approach inherited from the Soviet period.” Groups must register; the government can regulate their activities; at the instigation of the Orthodox Church, the state treats blasphemy as a crime; evangelism and worship by disfavored groups are treated as extremism and terrorism; and “religious groups not affiliated with state-controlled organizations are treated with suspicion.” The government, now nationalist rather than Communist, treats the Orthodox Church as a de facto state church.
Moreover, the USCIRF noted, “in Russian-occupied para-states of eastern Ukraine, religious freedom is at the whim of armed militias not beholden to any legal authority.” As war zones, the “People’s Republics” of Donetsk and Luhansk “remain heavily militarized war zones policed by parallel ‘Ministries of State Security.’” Unsurprisingly, “basic human rights, including freedom of religious belief, are under intense pressure in these territories.” Churches must register, but no churches that are non-Orthodox or that belong to the Kiev patriarchate of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church have been approved. Members of non-favored denominations “have been subject to arrest, torture, and murder. Churches were seized or destroyed, and parishioners were intimidated.” Whatever Russia’s justification for intervening in Ukraine, the suppression of freedom of conscience cannot be justified.

Members of non-favored denominations “have been subject to arrest, torture, and murder. Churches were seized or destroyed, and parishioners were intimidated.” Whatever Russia’s justification for intervening in Ukraine, the suppression of freedom of conscience cannot be justified.
The crimes promoted by Moscow are detailed in a new report, “Religious Freedom at Gunpoint: Russian Terror in the Occupied Territories of Eastern Ukraine,” from the Institute for Religious Freedom, underwritten by the Institute of Geopolitical Division and Mission Eurasia. The IRF found that abuses began as soon as pro-Russian separatists took control in April 2014. Anti-Semitic pamphlets first appeared. Then came “kidnapping and illegal imprisonment, emotional abuse, physical torture and even murders of unwelcome clergymen and believers of ‘non-traditional denominations.’” The result is “a real nightmare for local religious communities that did not experience such persecution even during the Soviet terror times. This was also accompanied by the seizure of churches and houses of worship, some of which were used as firing positions and barracks for militants, mercenaries and regular Russian troops.”
Ukraine has had a tortured political existence as an independent nation, but it has respected freedom of conscience. In 2014 the Orthodox Church, both the Moscow and the Kiev patriachates, made up more than half of the religious organizations in both Donetsk and Luhansk. But there was an abundance of other faiths and churches. For the first time in decades, people enjoyed liberty in faith.
However, that changed when the separatists took control. They sought to eliminate dissent, any hint of backing for the Kiev government. And they claimed that the Russian Orthodox Church had been oppressed, encouraging creation of an Orthodox state. The end result is that “most churches and faith-based communities in the occupied territories of Donetsk and Luhansk regions, with the exception of Orthodox parishes of the Moscow Patriarchate, are now forced to cease their religious activities or to significantly restrict them and to act in the underground.”
The persecution could hardly be worse. Houses of worship have been seized. Street gatherings are banned. Identification as a believer leads to additional punishment. Public evangelism is impossible. Literature cannot be distributed. Participation in common public activities, including hospital and prison chaplaincies, is barred.
The separatists make few distinctions among those viewed as foreign and those who are native but non-Orthodox. According to the IRF, “both large and small religious communities in eastern Ukraine, first of all, Evangelical Christians, Orthodox of the [Kiev] Patriarchate, Greek Catholics, and Jehovah’s Witnesses, are perceived by the separatists as a threat to their undivided and arbitrary power.” They are labeled “sectarians,” accused of “extremism,” and arrested.
Jehovah’s Witnesses, for instance, have been arrested and tortured. They have been prohibited from continuing their religious activities and the church is effectively banned. The Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church “also became an object of targeted attacks by the occupation authorities.” Mormons faced particular animus because they were viewed as an American faith.
Muslims also are persecuted. In Donetsk, authorities “raided the mosque” and “confiscated prayer books and other religious literature, sealed the premises, and then took the imam and parishioners of the mosque to interrogation.” Literature was banned. Muslim organizations were closed. Moreover, “Baptists, Pentecostals, Charismatics, Adventists and other Evangelical Christians (Protestants) are experiencing the greatest oppression by the occupation authorities in eastern Ukraine.” Evangelical ministers were subject to frequent “illegal arrests, beatings, tortures,” and even killings.
The IRF interviewed Leonid Padun, senior bishop of the Ukrainian Christian Evangelical Church. He explained that, “since it can still be threatening for the believers’ lives to come together for worship, the local religious communities have to do it secretly, without publicly announcing the place of their meetings. It is all the more dangerous to hold any street activities, to pray and preach the Gospel publicly, or distribute Christian literature.”
However, the Ukrainian Orthodox Church might be the most victimized. From the IRF report:
From the very beginning of the Russian aggression, the bishops, priests and believers of the UOC of the [Ukrainian] Patriarchate in general, pastoral care of believers in the Armed Forces of Ukraine and humanitarian service to war-affected people were perceived by the separatist leaders as a direct threat to their power in eastern Ukraine. Because of intimidation, arrests, and threats of being shot by the Russian-backed militants, all bishops of the [UkrainIan] Patriarchate gradually left the occupied region.
Obviously, the crimes being committed in eastern Ukraine are many. The separatists have not stopped there, however. Again, from the report: “The religious situation in the occupied territories of eastern Ukraine is further aggravated by the fact that the Russian-backed occupation authorities have begun to ‘legalize’ their crimes against believers and religious communities, trying to hide them from the international community under the umbrella of legitimacy.” The new authorities “adopted so-called ‘laws’ on religious activities and on combating extremism, which, like in Russia, have become instruments for terrorizing religious minorities, combating dissent and any expressions of opposition.”
The best that can be said is that persecution has ebbed. Nevertheless, according to the report, “although the worst abuses have declined since 2015, Christian minorities have remained subject to raids, harassment, fines, and official slander. Information about religious freedom violations is difficult to obtain because communities fear reprisals for complaints to human rights and foreign news organizations.”
Religious persecution by Christians is rare. Most religious persecution is perpetrated by Muslim regimes and authoritarian or atheist governments, most notably those that are Communist and formerly Communist. Russia and its Ukrainian dependents, however, are persecuting in the name of the Christian church. That makes their offenses even worse. How can Christians criticize governments of majority-Muslim, Hindu, and Buddhist governments for persecuting Christians if regimes claiming to represent Christianity do the same?
As long as the U.S. and Europe are at odds with Russia over its annexation of Crimea and support for Ukrainian separatists, there is little they can do directly to improve religious liberty in the region. Nonetheless, Washington and Brussels should lose no opportunity to embarrass Moscow publicly for persecuting Christians in the name of Christianity. Although religious liberty cannot drive American foreign policy, U.S. officials should promote fundamental human freedoms when practical. Now is such a time.

Coming to Terms with China's Rise,www.cato.org,Daniel J. Ikenson,04-02-2019,2019,4,https://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/coming-terms-chinas-rise,"By Daniel J. Ikenson on Forbes.com on April 2, 2019.
U.S. and Chinese negotiators may soon reach terms to ease the tariffs that have been uprooting supply chains and straining relations. That would be welcome news to beleaguered farmers, manufacturers, and consumers. But unless that deal compels Beijing to end its predatory technology practices and discriminatory commercial policies, détente will give way to intensified sanctions, collapse of the rules-based trading system, and the onset of an economic cold war. Depressingly, that outcome may be unavoidable, regardless.
That may sound over the top to those who think this dispute is about trade imbalances and the solution is for Beijing to purchase more U.S. commodities and lower a few market access barriers. President Trump might be tempted to accept that kind of deal, declare victory, and boast about how the trade war was easy to win. But that outcome would trivialize the compelling evidence of China’s transgressions, leave persistent structural problems unresolved, and provide an opening for Trump’s 2020 rivals to outflank him on the China issue.
Nor might that dire warning resonate with those who see Trump—and not Chinese policies—as the bigger problem. Certainly, Trump’s misinformed, zero-sum view of trade; his disdain for diplomacy and decorum; his grievance-laden, protectionist, nationalist narrative; and his contempt for global trade rules and institutions are the proximate causes of the trade war. But the United States and China were heading for a showdown long before Trump’s arrival and it is fanciful to assume U.S. policy will revert to historical norms once Trump is gone. There is cause for doubt that any deal to end the trade war will be long-lasting.
The tone may change, and some tactics may, too, but for all the divisiveness Trump foments and exploits, his blunt force approach to the China relationship uniquely attracts broad bipartisan support. Many are willing to excuse Trump’s defects because in his confrontation with China they see a higher purpose. Whether to make amends for years of ignoring China’s transgressions or to preserve America’s technological edge or to reassert the primacy of Pax Americana and compel a rising China to stay in its lane, the shift in public opinion and among policymakers toward a more unyielding posture is unmistakable.
These perceptions, which have been nourished by a combination of fact, fallacy and hyperbole, didn’t emerge overnight. They were sewn in the wake of the Great Recession, grew roots, and proliferated over the course of the last decade. Today, China is regarded as a strategic rival—if not an imminent adversary—intent on leapfrogging the United States to the technological fore by any means necessary. And that is cause for doubt that any deal to end the trade war will be long-lasting.
Even if Beijing takes measures to end forced technology transfer, significantly reduce intellectual property theft, remove the artificial advantages afforded state-owned enterprises, fully implement its WTO commitments, and become more transparent about its laws and regulations, there is still the matter of the national security imperative of being at the technological fore.
As long as technological preeminence—with all of the first-mover advantages that implies—is the overarching eco-strategic objective of the United States and China, the existing rules and institutions cannot be relied upon to restrain either government from taking whatever measures it sees as best serving that goal. Realistically, neither Washington nor Beijing could be expected to refrain from industrial policies or protectionism if those measures were deemed essential to maintaining or attaining the inside track in the technology race.
Consider that the U.S. government has imposed a de facto ban on telecommunications gear produced by the Chinese company Huawei because of concerns that it will channel sensitive information to the Chinese government. Theoretically, that’s a legitimate concern. If the infrastructure through which information and data are transmitted is susceptible to cyberespionage, cybertheft, or other forms of cybermalfeasance, then governments are justified in taking measures to mitigate those risks. But the U.S. government’s approach, which is to prevent any Huawei gear from being deployed in the U.S. 5G infrastructure build-out, and to use its leverage to compel other governments around the world to ban Huawei gear, is too absolutist to be considered “mitigation.” Eradication is more the theme.
The World Trade Organization is not equipped to handle this problem. Sure, China could bring a case against the United States for discriminating against Huawei products. The United States could then defend its actions by invoking what is known as the “national security exception,” or it could just ignore the WTO altogether, adopting the posture that the United States will no longer submit to rules that limit its options for responding to national security threats, real or otherwise.
By banning Huawei gear and putting pressure on third countries to do the same, the United States is effectively saying that a huge swath of 21st century trade—an estimated $12.3 trillion in sales activity across multiple industries involved in developing 5G infrastructure and producing 5G enabled products by 2035, according to the Congressional Research Service—will not be subject to the disciplines of the global trading system. If that doesn’t consign the WTO to insignificance, the ensuing race to carve up the world into spheres of influence based on competing 5G standards will.
In what will look like a replay of the Cold War, Beijing and Washington will compete for the loyalties of the rest of the world by offering carrots and threatening sticks to countries to adopt their respective 5G standards. Dividing the world into these technology blocs will deprive the technology ecosystem of global economies of scale and open the door to bloc-based tariffs and other forms of protectionism, making the world a poorer place. Creation of the open global trading system induced a steady climb in global exports from 4% of GDP in 1947 to 26% of GDP in 2015. Erecting tariffs and non-tariff barriers through that system would undoubtedly cause a decline in global trade and output.
In an era when national security has been invoked frivolously as an excuse for protectionism, it is easy to forget that there are legitimate national security interests to protect. The rules and institutions developed under U.S. leadership after World War II, which fostered unprecedented economic growth, wealth creation, and relative peace, emerged not because the United States was an altruistic, benevolent giant that subordinated its own interests to the global order, but because a stronger Europe, a stronger Japan, and a stronger world capable of purchasing U.S. products and resisting Soviet expansionism was very much in America’s national security interests.
If the United States and China are going to adhere to international rules going forward, they will have to be convinced that doing so is, first and foremost, in their own interests. That will require new rules, and it will be no easy task. Daniel J. Ikenson is the director of Cato’s Herbert A.

"Biden, Still Considering a 2020 Run, Faces New Charges of Improper Touching",thepoliticalinsider.com,Lifezette,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://thepoliticalinsider.com/biden-still-eyeing-2020-faces-new-charges-of-improper-touching/,"Biden, Still Eyeing 2020, Faces New Charges of Improper Touching LifeZette By LifeZette | April 3, 2019 9:19AM
By PoliZette Staff | April 3, 2019
Two more women have come forward this week to say that former Vice President Joe Biden touched them, without their permission, in ways that made them uncomfortable — yet some people remain steadfast in their defense of the 76-year-old Democrat.
Two women, Caitlyn Caruso, who is 22, and D. J. Hill, 59, shared their experiences with The New York Times for a piece that was published on Monday.
Caruso claimed that Biden rested his hand on her thigh during an event about sexual assault, of all things, at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas.
Caruso was 19 at the time of the incident.
She said she squirmed in her seat to try to show her discomfort and that Biden also hugged her “just a little bit too long.”
The alleged interaction, she said, was uncomfortable for her partly because she had just talked about her own sexual assault — and she had expected the former vice president to be more cognizant of physical boundaries with others.
“It doesn’t even really cross your mind that such a person would dare perpetuate harm like that,” she told The Times. “These are supposed to be people you can trust.”
Related: Biden Is Accused by Yet Another Woman of Unwanted Touching
Hill, 59, said that in 2012, when she was taking a photograph with Biden, the then-vice president put his hand on her shoulder and moved it down her back — which made her “very uncomfortable.”
Both Lucy Flores , a former Nevada state lawmaker, and Amy Lappos, a former congressional aide to Rep. Jim Himes (D-Conn.), have also accused Biden of unwanted touching.
A spokesperson on Sunday said Biden over the years has “offered countless handshakes, hugs, expressions of affection, support and comfort. And not once — never — did I believe I acted inappropriately,” said Biden. “If it is suggested I did so, I will listen respectfully.”
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) on Tuesday, during a breakfast event in Washington, D.C., urged the former vice president to be more careful going forward.
“I’ve known Joe Biden a long time. My grandchildren love Joe Biden,” she said. “He’s an affectionate person — to children, to senior citizens, to everyone, that’s just the way he is … But that’s just not the way — join the straight-arm club with me, if you will,” Pelosi added.
“Just pretend you have a cold and I have a cold,” she also said .
Interestingly, some in Hollywood have come to Biden’s immediate defense.
Actress Alyssa Milano basically told everyone to chill about the issue.
And some aren’t too happy with that. So you had a positive interaction with Biden, thus he’s conducted himself professionally with all women? Wow. Congrats. You just threw the #metoo movement away into the trash. White feminism will side with the patriarchy every single time. "
"CNN Anchor: Is ""Lock her Up"" Chant Hate Speech? – Dan Bongino",bongino.com,,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://bongino.com/cnn-anchor-is-lock-her-up-chant-hate-speech/,"April 3, 2019 C NN journalist Christiane Amanpour is wondering if the ever-popular “lock her up” chant about Hillary Clinton should be considered “hate speech.”
In a wide-ranging interview with disgraced former FBI Director James Comey which aired yesterday, Amanpour asked if he wished the FBI could have “shut down” that kind of language. Advertisement
“Of course ‘lock her up’ was a feature of the 2016 Trump campaign. Do you, in retrospect, wish that people like yourself, the head of the FBI, I mean the people in charge of law and order had shut down that language, that it was dangerous potentially, that it could have created violence, that it was kind of hate speech? Should that have been allowed?” Advertisement
Comey responded, “That’s not a role for government to play. The beauty of this country is people can say what they want, even if it’s misleading and it’s demagoguery. The people who should have shut it down were Republicans who understand the rule of law and the values that they claim to stand for. Shame on them. But it wasn’t a role for government to play.” PREVIOUS "
Joker teaser trailer: Joaquin Phoenix puts on a happy face (VIDEO).,slate.com,Natalia Winkelman,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/joker-trailer-joaquin-phoenix-robert-de-niro-video.html,"Pet Sematary Ruined a Generation’s Ability to Spell Cemetery “My mother always tells me to smile and put on a happy face,” declares Joaquin Phoenix in the moody first trailer for Joker , the upcoming DC origin story directed by Todd Phillips. The movie will deliver plenty of smiles—not all of them particularly cheerful—in what looks to be a pretty devastating backstory for the esteemed Batman villain once embodied by Heath Ledger in an Oscar-winning performance. (We’ve already let Jared Leto’s less successful take on the clown fade from our memory.) But Phoenix—an actor who excels at juggling the tragic and the comic —is already more promising in the freakish role of Arthur Fleck, a clownish comedian struggling in his career. Set in 1981, Joker will show how Fleck’s disillusionment drives his turn to the Gotham City’s wicked underworld. The film is already being compared to brooding Robert De Niro classics like Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy, so it’s fitting that the film will also feature De Niro, who shows up briefly in the trailer as a talk-show host. There’s also another smiling, possibly legitimately happy face, that of Zazie Beetz, who will play a love interest. Joker will hit theaters October 4.

Tiverton's Red Dory restaurant sold to former chef at The Back Eddy,www.providencejournal.com,"Linda Murphy / The Herald News (Fall River, Mass.)",04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.providencejournal.com/news/20190403/tivertons-red-dory-restaurant-sold-to-former-chef-at-back-eddy,"Tiverton's Red Dory restaurant sold to former chef at The Back Eddy By Linda Murphy / The Herald News (Fall River, Mass.) 8:22 AM Apr 3, 2019 at 8:22 AM
TIVERTON — When The Red Dory opens its doors on Wednesday, customers might not notice any significant changes, that is, unless they ask to speak to the owner.
Tiverton resident Aaron DeRego is the new owner of the Stone Bridge area restaurant, taking over for retiring chef/owner Steve Johnson.
DeRego’s no stranger to the kitchen. For the past 17 years, he was the chef/co-owner of The Back Eddy, but when he found out Johnson was retiring, he knew he wanted to strike out on his own, especially since he lives right up the road from The Red Dory, he said.
Johnson, a James Beard Award-nominated chef opened The Red Dory in late 2014. A resident of Westport, Johnson had been eyeing the former Stone Bridge Restaurant for more than a dozen years. The owner finally accepted Johnson’s bid to buy the restaurant and Johnson made extensive changes to the restaurant before opening it as The Red Dory. Before bringing his culinary talents to the SouthCoast, Johnson owned the Boston restaurants Rendezvous and The Blue Room.
The extensive changes to the menu and the restaurant’s interior after the transfer of ownership won’t happen this time around, said DeRego, praising Johnson’s coastal-inspired, mostly Mediterranean menu. Johnson and DeRego have known each other for many years, even before DeRego became a co-owner at The Back Eddy.
As a frequent diner at The Red Dory, DeRego said he always knew he wanted to be a part of Johnson’s exit from the restaurant when he retired. “I spent 20 years at The Back Eddy and I feel like I did my time there,” said DeRego. “This opportunity came about and I saw it as an opportunity to not only break away from the volume and extreme seasonality of The Back Eddy, but also as a way of getting into a place that’s more ‘neighborhoody’ and a little bit closer to home.”
DeRego, who grew up in Dartmouth, has lived in Tiverton for about 24 years. Growing up, he worked at his father’s restaurant, Chippy’s in New Bedford’s South End. When he moved to Tiverton he started working at the Stone House and worked at The Back Eddy when it first opened under Chris Schlesinger, a James Beard Award-winning chef and owner at the time. A few years later, DeRego became the chef/owner at The Back Eddy.
“He’s a perfect fit. He’s a Tiverton resident, he’s married to the farmer’s daughter (Ferolbink Farm) so he’s part of the local fabric and he already does business with all the people over here,” said Johnson. “I think he’s going to take what we’ve done here to date and build on it and make it better.”
DeRego said he will focus on local vendors for produce, seafood and meat as much as possible. It’s an easy decision, he said, given the abundance of local foods in the coastal area.
The number one selling appetizer, said Johnson, is the cornmeal-crusted fried oysters. Because of the setting overlooking Mount Hope Bay, seafood is a popular choice among diners, but they also sell a fair number of steaks and meatballs,” added Johnson.
The most immediate changes customers will notice, said DeRego, will be a more extensive wine list and a larger cocktail menu. “To me, he’s doing a lot of the right things. I’m not changing the name; I’m not changing the staff. The first decision when I agreed to purchase it from Steve was did he make enough of a name of the restaurant? And as a regular customer, it was an obvious answer for me: yes he did,” said DeRego. “I’m not trying to reinvent The Red Dory.... It’s not The Back Eddy; it’s The Red Dory.”

"Trump Spreads Another Conspiracy Theory, Claiming Windmill Noise Causes Cancer | HillReporter.com",hillreporter.com,Todd Neikirk,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://hillreporter.com/trump-spreads-another-conspiracy-theory-claiming-windmill-noise-causes-cancer-29657,"BY Todd Neikirk April 3, 2019
The United States has long sought to cut its dependence on oil and gas by finding renewable resources. One energy resource that’s experienced popularity in other countries is wind power.
While there are positives and negatives to every renewable resource, wind power particularly sticks in the craw of the president. Last week, he mocked the solution, saying, “sometimes the wind doesn’t blow.” Last night, he doubled down on his attack, claiming windmills lower home values and cause cancer.
Trump told the crowd at the NRCC dinner, “Hillary wanted to put up wind. Wind. If you have a windmill anywhere near your house, congratulations, your house just went down 75 percent in value. And they say the noise causes cancer”
The idea that wind turbine noise causes cancer is a popular conspiracy theory. The science behind the theory, however, has been completely debunked .
While studies have shown that wind turbines do affect property value, it’s nowhere close to the 75% Trump claims. This study from appraiser, Michael McCann, estimates the depreciation at 25-40%.
Despite the president’s disapproval, wind power is on the rise in the United States. According to the Energy Information Association, “wind power is on track to surpass hydropower as the country’s largest source of renewable energy by 2019.” Follow Us On: Facebook and Twitter Previous Post "

Michael Brown’s mother finishes third in Ferguson City Council race - Vox.com,www.vox.com,,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.vox.com/identities/2019/4/2/18292723/michael-brown-lesley-mcspadden-ferguson-city-council-loss,"Lesley McSpadden, 39, is vying for a seat on the Ferguson City Council nearly five years after the death of her son, Michael Brown. Sandra Dahdah/Getty Images It’s been nearly five years since Michael Brown, a black 18-year-old, was shot and killed by Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson. It was an event that reverberated around the country, driving increased national attention to the ways that police violence affectscommunities of color, fueling increased calls for police reform and accountability. On Tuesday, Brown’s mother, Lesley McSpadden, competed in a three-way race for a seat on the Ferguson City Council, a position that would give her the chance to push for institutional change in the city and oversee the very police force whose officer shot her son. McSpadden lost that race , finishing third with roughly 20 percent of the vote . McSpadden (who sometimes goes by Lezley) formally announced her campaign to represent Ferguson’s Third Ward last August, as she stood steps away from where her son was fatally shot in 2014. “Almost four years ago to this day, I ran down this very street, and my son was covered in a sheet,” McSpadden said during a press conference last year. She moved into the district shortly before announcing her candidacy, and made her son’s death a central pillar of her campaign, saying that one of her top objectives for the city is to improve police accountability and reform. McSpadden also called for improved community mental health resources, and better after-school programs for local children. McSpadden is also a member of the “Mothers of the Movement” — a group of black women who have lost children to the police and vigilante violence that played a central role in the national rise of Black Lives Matter. McSpadden was the second woman in this group to run for political office; in 2018, Lucy McBath , whose son Jordan Davis was shot and killed in 2012, won her congressional election in Georgia’s Sixth District. “I don’t want my children to grow up in a city where what happened to Michael can happen to anyone else,” McSpadden explained in a May 2018 op-ed for the Root months before formally announcing her campaign. “We need to rebuild the entire system from the inside out. The only way that can be done is by having people, like me, who have been harmed by the system working inside it to make the right change that is needed.” McSpadden said that her personal experiences made her the right fitto represent Ferguson McSpadden was in a competitive race in a predominantly black district, and needed to defeat two other candidates to win her seat. Fran Griffin, a black mother and local community organizer who sits on several community boards, had the support of some local activists. According to unofficial results, Griffin won the election with nearly 44 percent of the vote. This means that Griffin unseated the third competitor in the race, incumbent council member Keith Kallstrom. On policing, Kallstrom had backed increasing salaries for officers, and stressed his support of the Ferguson Police Department’s ongoing reform efforts three years after entering a consent decree (a formal police reform agreement) with the Justice Department. Both of her competitors had more experience in local politics, and McSpadden’s critics argued that she hadn’t been a reliable voice on local issue s in the time since she’s moved into the third ward. But Brown’s mother said that she would bring an important perspective to the council. “I wanted to go back and do something right in a place that did something so very wrong to my son, and I think that’s what my son would want as well,” McSpadden said in a recent interview with the Associated Press . While McSpadden did not win, Griffin’s success in the race does suggest that police reform supporters in Ferguson are continuing to see political success. Last August, Wesley Bell , a black former Ferguson City Council member, defeated the incumbent St. Louis County prosecutor, Bob McCulloch — the man who failed to secure an indictment against Wilson in 2014. McSpadden says that even with her loss, she will continue to work to bring a change to the city. “I feel proud of the positive race we ran, and I loved talking to the Ferguson community,” she said Tuesday night in an emailed statement, the Associated Press reports . “Tomorrow, the work continues and I intend to be a part of it no matter my position. I’m not going anywhere.” Next Up In Identities"
Breaking the Silence on My Rape | Opinion,www.newsweek.com,Kristine Holst,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsweek.com/sexual-assault-scandinavia-consent-based-laws-1384780,"Breaking the Silence on My Rape | Opinion Kristine Holst On 4/3/19 at 11:05 AM EDT Share Opinion
A few weeks ago, an ordinary-looking man in a grey suit came on the television and said something which made me cry.
The man was Danish Prime Minister, Lars Løkke Rasmussen, announcing that his government would introduce new consent-based rape laws.
To understand why the news of some legislation would reduce me to tears, it is necessary to understand the journey that I have been on for almost two years: a journey that began one summer’s night, when I was raped.
I wasn’t raped by a stranger in a dark alley but by someone I considered a friend, in an apartment where I thought I was safe. I was staying over at his flat in Copenhagen, as I had done before, when he came into my room.
He wanted sex. I refused. He got into my bed. I resisted. He put his arm around my throat, pinned me to the bed and raped me.
The morning after, I was in a state of shock.
It took me a whole day before I was even able to say the word 'rape'. Instead I found myself using the word 'accident', and in many ways the sensation was not so dissimilar to the disorientation one feels after having been involved in a violent car crash.
Over the following days, I struggled to report the rape to the police. It took four attempts - and on the second attempt I was taken to a small office and warned that I could go to prison if I was lying.
For the next year-and-a-half, I struggled to navigate the complex, slow and, at times, intrusive justice system. The worst aspect of the experience was the focus by the police, the lawyers and the judge on whether there was evidence of physical violence: on whether I had resisted, rather than whether I had consented.
Although I had told the rapist many times to stop, I was repeatedly asked questions about the physical evidence that I had resisted.
This focus reflects the fact that Danish law still does not define rape on the basis of lack of consent. Instead, it uses a definition based on whether physical violence, threat or coercion is involved or if the victim is found to have been unable to resist. The assumption that a victim gives consent because she has not physically resisted is deeply problematic, since “involuntary paralysis” or “freezing” has been recognized by experts as a very common physiological and psychological response to sexual assault.
This is not just the case in Denmark.
Paradoxically, despite Scandianvia's image as a land of gender equality, the reality for women in Nordic countries is starkly different. As revealed in a report by Amnesty International today , Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden have disturbingly high levels of rape, and survivors of sexual violence are being failed by their justice systems . Flawed legislation and widespread harmful rape myths and gender stereotypes have resulted in endemic impunity for rapists across the region.
Under the Istanbul Convention, a human rights treaty ratified by all the Nordic countries, rape and all other non-consensual acts of a sexual nature must be classified as criminal offences. Whilst Sweden reformed its laws last year, Finland, Norway and Denmark still use a definition based on whether physical violence, threat or coercion is involved or if the victim is found to have been unable to resist due to, for example, sleep or heavy intoxication.
This focus on resistance and violence rather than on consent has an impact not only on the reporting of rape but also on wider awareness of sexual violence, both of which are key aspects in preventing rape and tackling impunity.
Last year I found out that the man who raped me had been acquitted. The court had been unable to prove beyond reasonable doubt his intention to commit violence.
I was upset, frustrated and angry. I felt the residual trust that I had in the justice system evaporate. But rather than give up, I decided to take action.
I contacted Amnesty International and other organizations. I met with other survivors and together we formed the #LetsTalkAboutYes campaign to raise awareness of the lack of justice for rape victims.
The purpose of the campaign was to open people's eyes to the realities, to encourage them to take a stand and to change attitudes to the way rape is viewed and is dealt with. But most importantly, our aim was to change the law so that it was able to give us as citizens what we are entitled to: protection from violence.
For the campaign to be effective, we recognized that it would be necessary to break the wall of silence that surrounds the issue of rape. Together with several other rape survivors we began to tell our stories publicly: first on Facebook and then more widely.
It was not easy at first, speaking about such a painful and personal experience to strangers and journalists beneath the glare of studio lights. But it became easier, and I found it also gave me strength.
In February I joined a delegation delivering 50,000 signatures calling for a change in Denmark’s law to the Minister of Justice. In March, together with other survivors, I spoke to more than 100 journalists and policy makers at the launch of Amnesty International’s report on rape which contained my story.
And not only did we speak: we were heard.
New legislation to amend the legal definition of rape in Denmark could be voted on very soon. We look forward to seeing the law, and we hope it will reflect the priorities set out by survivors.
I hope that the journey that began on the night of my rape will culminate soon in the passing of consent-based legislation not just in Denmark, but in Finland and Norway too.
What this experience has shown me is that – when women come together and bravely speak out – change is not just possible: it is inevitable.

"Business Leaders, Investors, and Experts to IEA: Align With Paris and Help Us Plan for Success",www.commondreams.org,,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.commondreams.org/views/2019/04/03/business-leaders-investors-and-experts-iea-align-paris-and-help-us-plan-success,"Oil Change International Business Leaders, Investors, and Experts to IEA: Align With Paris and Help Us Plan for Success
As it stands, even the IEA’s so-called “climate scenario” is encouraging massive continued investment in fossil fuels that we cannot burn if we are to stay within the Paris limits by 0 Comments
The IEA has a mandate “to ensure reliable, affordable and clean energy.” (Photo: Electrek)
In order to succeed, we need the best tools at our disposal. We need to understand whether decisions will lead to success or failure, and we need policymakers and investors to have access to that information. Remarkably, almost all energy decision-making is based on assumptions that we will fail in meeting the Paris climate goals. This includes the go-to source for descriptions of our energy future: the International Energy Agency (IEA).
Today, over 40 business leaders, investors, and energy experts found remarkable alignment around demanding more from the IEA. In a letter covered by the Financial Times , a broad collection of signatories called on the IEA to develop a truly Paris-aligned scenario (including a reasonable chance at staying within 1.5 degrees Celsius with a precautionary approach to Negative Emissions Technologies), and make this the central scenario in the World Energy Outlook ( WEO ), replacing the current dominant business-as-usual scenario.
The letter’s signatories range widely: heads of major businesses, asset managers and leaders of major investor networks, former heads of state and politicians, leading academics and experts in energy, and more.
“Without the inclusion of a central and realistic 1.5C scenario going forward, the World Energy Outlook would abdicate its responsibility to continue to chart the boundaries of the path of the global energy sector,” the letter reads.
The suggested changes to the IEA’s WEO would have an outsized impact on everything from the urgent need to “shift the trillions” away from climate-incompatible fossil fuel financing to helping governments plan for success in energy decision-making to how we collectively conceive our energy future. This dangerous combination of capital and climate risk must be addressed.
The IEA has a mandate “to ensure reliable, affordable and clean energy,” and yet its main description of what the future of energy might look like, the “New Policies Scenario,” assumes we are still on track for between 2.7 and 3.3 degrees Celsius of warming. And since that is the future the IEA emphasises, energy decision-makers treat it as the default, most likely outcome. The resulting policies and investments risk making it a self-fulfilling prophecy – past expansions of fossil fuel development in places like the Australian coal basins and Canadian tar sands have cited the IEA’s scenarios as justification for continued build-out.
Even IEA’s “Sustainable Development Scenario,” which is little more than a footnote in the IEA’s press releases, falls short of the Paris goals. Both assume that fossil fuels will continue to dominate our energy mix for decades to come, an assumption that dangerously underestimates our collective ability to do what it is necessary to address this challenge. This ambition shortfall is even more egregious on the heels of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s “Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5ºC” released last fall .
One of the great successes of the Paris Agreement was that it made a fossil fuel-free future seem possible. As a result, we can imagine renewable energy powering economic development and providing energy access for all, we can imagine transporting ourselves and our goods without diesel or petrol, and we can imagine a managed but ambitious transition of workers, communities, and economies away from dependence on the energy of the past. This expansion of the collective political imagination is critical to our shared progress.
An emerging group of actors are redefining “climate leadership” by putting an end to approvals and financing for fossil fuel expansion, and setting critical global precedents for what a phase-out of oil, coal, and gas can look like. But the majority of energy decisions around the world are not yet this forward-thinking, in part no doubt because they are based on energy scenarios that lead to failure.
A failure to plan for success is a threat not only to the climate, but to our economies as well. Investors make decisions based on the IEA’s energy demand scenarios daily, and failing to get it right threatens billions upon billions of dollars in capital. As it stands, even the IEA’s so-called “climate scenario” is encouraging massive continued investment in fossil fuels that we cannot burn if we are to stay within the Paris limits.
This dangerous combination of capital and climate risk must be addressed. The world needs scenarios that assume success in meeting our collective goals, rather than projections of current and inadequate ambition. Recognizing these risks, the signatories of this letter are using their positions as key WEO users to demand the Paris-aligned ambition we need from the IEA.
The IEA has deep and rich expertise in projecting our energy future, but it is time for it to evolve. We need a vision for the future that is predicated on success, and this new climate scenario must become the centerpiece of the IEA’s annual flagship World Energy Outlook .
We are living in times of exciting and unprecedented change: Commitments and actions that would have been unthinkable just a few short years ago are challenging our assumptions and our imaginations. We cannot afford to underestimate ourselves by assuming that the future will do little more than follow the trends of the past. We must base our decisions on assuming success, and embrace the bold leadership it will take to get us there. © 2019 Oil Change International This is the world we live in. This is the world we cover.

And they think that banning abortions or putting tighter restrictions on them will somehow set women's rights back. It won't. Women today have access to high tech birth control that my mother DIDN'T have when she was young (meaning there were fewer choices in her day) and definitely much better than what my grandmother had and the generations before her. There is little to no reason for a woman to have an unplanned pregnancy in our day and age...there are exceptions, but those occur less frequently (like pregnancy because of rape). They keep screaming about women's rights as if her rights trump everything else. Once you are pregnant, your baby should come before all else. I love it when they say that a baby is a ""potential life"". A baby is living thing from the moment of conception/implantation. It would be growing if it wasn't."
