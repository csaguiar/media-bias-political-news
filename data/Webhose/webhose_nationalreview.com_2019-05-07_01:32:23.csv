Burma Rohingya Muslim Genocide: Trump Administration Action Needed Review,www.nationalreview.com,,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2018/08/burmas-rohingya-muslims-need-trump-administrations-help/,"About Nina Shea August 17, 2018 1:57 PM A group of Rohingya refugees walk in the water after crossing the Bangladesh-Myanmar border in Teknaf, Bangladesh, September 1, 2017. (Mohammad Ponir Hossain/Reuters) President Obama stood idly by as the Burmese government slaughtered the Rohingya. President Trump can and must do better.
T hroughout its second term, the Obama administration downplayed mounting evidence that Burma’s Rohingya community was being deliberately eradicated by the country’s military. Genocide was an inconvenient fact for an administration eager to claim a foreign-policy achievement in Burma’s democratic transition. With U.S. help, in 2015–16, Burma had been transformed from a pariah military dictatorship into a democracy headed by Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, an international human-rights icon. But Burma’s deplorable religious-freedom record was hardly a secret.
Since 1999, Burma has been designated a severe and systematic religious persecutor under the U.S. International Religious Freedom Act. Its ethnic Rohingya Muslim and Kachin, Chin, and Karen Christian minorities have been regularly oppressed and subjected to brutal attempts of forcible conversion by its Buddhist majority. Violent conflict between them and a military bent on “Burmanization” has raged on and off since the country’s 1948 independence from Britain.
In 2012, the attacks against the Rohingya Muslims in Burma’s northern Rakhine state became particularly intense. That year, Genocide Watch issued an emergency alert that these Rohingya were being slaughtered and driven from their homes. On May 20, 2013, noted human-rights advocates Jose Ramos Horta, Muhammad Yunus, and Benedict Rogers wrote of these early warning signs of genocide in the New York Times :
The Rohingyas were recognized until the 1982 Citizenship Law stripped them of their citizenship and rendered them stateless. Since then, they have faced a slow-burning campaign of persecution, which exploded last June and again in October, resulting in the deaths of at least 1,000 and the displacement of at least 130,000. . . . Human Rights Watch has published evidence of mass graves and a campaign of ethnic cleansing.
In 2015, amid continuing horrific news accounts from Rakhine, the prestigious Allard K. Lowenstein International Human Rights Clinic at Yale Law School produced a legal analysis finding “strong evidence of genocide against the Rohingya population,” based on “the record of anti-Rohingya rhetoric from government officials and Buddhist leaders, the policies that specifically target Rohingya, and the mass scale of the abuses against Rohingya [that] make it difficult to avoid inferring an intent to destroy Rohingya.” By 2016, 93,000 Rohingya had been killed, brutalized, raped, or forcibly displaced, according to the UNHCR.
Nevertheless, in September 2016, President Obama welcomed Burma’s newly elected head of state Suu Kyi to the White House and honored her with an Oval Office meeting. The occasion was marked with a self-congratulatory joint announcement that omitted any mention of the Rohingya’s plight. That October, Obama lifted American economic sanctions against Burma, bestowing trade benefits, business loans, and educational exchanges on the country’s government. He even committed a Peace Corps mission to Burma, possibly the first in a country waging ongoing genocide.
Throughout, Suu Kyi has said and done nothing about the Rohingya crisis. Only once, after her election, in April 2016, did she mention the Rohingya at all — and even then it was only to demand that the U.S. ambassador stop calling them “Rohingya,” since the Burmese government doesn’t recognize the minority group as citizens. By 2015, fellow Nobel peace laureates, including the Tibetan Buddhist Dalai Lama, began entreating Suu Kyi to break her silence. In 2016, after accusations that Suu Kyi was complicit in genocide, groups that had previously honored her activism with awards began revoking them; the U.S. Holocaust Museum stripped her of its Elie Wiesel award in early 2017. Both Suu Kyi’s reputation and Burma’s nascent democracy have been irretrievably tarnished by her government’s treatment of the Rohingya. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement
Former president Obama can’t say he didn’t know. His own State Department’s reports described the atrocities. In his eagerness to build a foreign-policy legacy, he undervalued religious freedom. An administration that prided itself on concern about genocide and Islamophobia undermined both through its apparent contempt for religious freedom. It downplayed the repression of Rohingya Muslims in order to brandish Burma’s ostensible move toward a form of democracy — one that lacked essential freedoms for its large population of ethno-religious minorities — as a foreign-policy success. Burma’s military likely took this as a sign that it could finish eradicating the Rohingya without fear of international backlash.
August 2017 saw further attacks. These were not the beginning of the genocide, as media accounts might lead one to believe, but its culmination. Following Rohingya terrorist attacks against police, the Burmese army forced virtually all the remaining, overwhelmingly innocent Rohingya men, women, and children to flee for their lives. Reports surfaced of bayoneting babies, rape, and burning alive those who did not run fast enough. Today, over 700,000 Rohingya refugees shelter across the border in Bangladesh, confined to squalid, waterlogged camps. Advertisement
In September, the Trump administration fast-tracked $32 million in fresh aid to a new wave of Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh and soon began applying Magnitsky Act sanctions against Burma’s military. Ambassador-at-Large for International Religious Freedom Sam Brownback visited Rohingya refugees in his first official trip, and recently dispatched investigators to collect evidence of genocide.

Genocide Watch president Gregory Stanton, who has studied every recognized genocide since the Khmer Rouge’s in Cambodia, argues that the genocide label is too infrequently applied by world leaders. Unlike “ethnic cleansing,” genocide has legal meaning. If the Obama administration had acknowledged the Rohingya crisis as a religious genocide, it could have forced a different policy response with the potential to prevent further attacks.
Even now, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo can still make a finding of genocide, and he should. It will strengthen survivor claims to compensation, restoration, and justice, while reiterating that America recognizes the central importance of religious freedom to the growth of emerging democracies abroad.

Nationalism and Nationism: Goldberg vs. Lowry | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Rich Lowry,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/nationalism-debate-nationism/,"Follow Rich Lowry on Twitter April 6, 2019 8:10 PM
I’m happy to report that I wasn’t nearly as annoyed by Jonah’s “nationism” post as I expected to be. He makes many good points, although I still believe that “nationism” is just a way to come up with a private vocabulary to avoid giving “nationalism” its due. But what’s a couple of letters among friends?"
Brexit: Deal or No Deal | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Kevin D. Williamson,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/brexit-deal-or-no-deal/,"April 7, 2019 5:08 PM A pro-Brexit, yellow-vest protester in London, March 30, 2019 (Henry Nicholls/Reuters) The U.K. needs those European goods, and the Europeans are of course keen to sell them.
W hen the politicians talk about international trade, they always talk about what the businesses in their country can sell. But British businesses, faced with the possibility of an interruption with their trade relations with the European Union, are at the moment worried about what they can buy.
The United Kingdom has decided to leave the EU, and the specter of a “no-deal Brexit” — an end to the U.K.–EU relationship without an accord to replace it — has British businesses “hoarding at rates rarely seen outside of wartime,” as the Wall Street Journal puts it. BMW AG, which manufactures Mini automobiles in the United Kingdom, is stocking up on parts and hunting for storage. Other companies are stockpiling automobile components, aerospace parts, machinery, food ingredients, and the raw materials for pharmaceuticals, among other things. Advertisement Advertisement
The great benefit of trade is the imports, not the exports — the politicians always get that wrong. You would think that the United Kingdom, with its proud history of world-bestriding trade, would appreciate that first of all countries. For eons, kings, consuls, emperors, and khans undertook enormous pains to keep the trade routes open and to establish new ones, building everything from roads to navies to educational institutions (propagating the once-arcane sciences of accounting and basic finance) to enable the exchange of goods. It is a myth that the Romans salted the fields of conquered Carthage: They ate the grain Carthage grew, and only would have been starving themselves. They needed those imports.
In our time, we have stood that on its head, and as the merchants of the world bring the best of everything to our shores for our use and delight, our biggest worry is that they are not charging us enough money for their goods. These are dumb times. Advertisement
There is going to be a U.K.–EU trade deal. The ladies and gentlemen in Brussels may have their feelings hurt after John Bull dumped them, but the powers that be in Stuttgart and Munich know how many of their cars are sold in the United Kingdom. Germans like money, too. Advertisement
As it stands, EU duties on non-EU goods are not especially high: U.S. firms pay an average of 4.2 percent on industrial goods sent to the EU, while EU firms pay about 3.1 percent on goods sent to the United States. The United Kingdom is a big, rich, important market for European exports, and the Brits are going to get themselves a good deal one way or the other. They need those European goods, and the Europeans are of course keen to sell them.
As I have argued before, this presents the British with the opportunity to make themselves a very good deal that requires no input from Brussels at all, a very British solution to their manufacturers’ worries about importing the materials and components they need: unilateral free trade. Hang up a sign reading “ Yes, Please ,” and send a thank-you note to John Major for refusing to exchange the British pound for the euro. Treat British subjects like free and intelligent adults, which many of them are, and let them choose for themselves what kind of shoes they want. Advertisement
There’s a lesson in this for Americans, too: As President Trump talks about sealing off the Mexican border and, hence, cutting off trade, American firms involved in everything from manufacturing automobiles and electronics to making ice cream are being threatened with losing access to their most important components and raw materials. That is the stuff out of which American prosperity is made, and cutting ourselves off from the sources of our prosperity out of pique is the worst kind of politics. Advertisement
It’s an interdependent world out there, and a complicated one. The United States has become an energy powerhouse that currently is exporting a lot of oil — and importing a lot of oil, too: We export the sweet stuff and import the heavier Saudi stuff for our refineries, many of which are optimized for that kind of oil. Iran has some of the world’s richest oil reserves, and it imports a great deal of gasoline. If you think your pickup truck is “Made in the USA,” don’t ask too many questions about that. Advertisement
The alternative to trade is autarky, the backwards philosophy of “produce what you consume and consume what you produce” that has done such wonders for North Korea and Venezuela. The last time Great Britain had that kind of economy, it was . . . not so great."
Border Crisis: DHS Bureaucracy Contributes to Enforcement Problems | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Rich Lowry,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/border-crisis-immigration-enforcement-dhs-bureaucracy/,"Follow Rich Lowry on Twitter April 7, 2019 10:18 PM
So Kirstjen Nielsen is out . The border crisis was running out of her control, and will run out of the control of any DHS secretary, since court orders and congressional enactments created the predicate for the crisis and have to be reversed to fundamentally change the situation. But there are opportunities to tighten up how the bureaucracy, especially at USCIS, handles credible-fear interviews and other matters. Nothing that can be done internally will be transformative, but this might make a difference at the margins."
"Burma Military & Rohingyas: To Save Them, Go after the Generals Review",www.nationalreview.com,,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2018/08/rohingya-refugee-crisis-target-burma-generals/,"August 31, 2018 6:30 AM Burma Commander in Chief Senior General Min Aung Hlaing (Ann Wang/Reuters) In effect, the country has two governments: the limited, elected civilian government led by Aung San Suu Kyi, and the military.
S ixteen year-old Khalida lay prostrate on the floor of a bamboo hut in a refugee camp in Bangladesh, unable to stand. The bullet wounds in her leg were so severe that she could not even sit up. “More than 300 Rohingyas in my village were killed by the Burma army in their attack,” she told me. “My father, two sisters, and one brother were killed. My mother was also shot but survived.” Advertisement Advertisement
Her 18 year-old brother, Mohamed Rafiq, had fled their home in Molor Jaga village, in Maungdaw Township in northern Rakhine, before the military attacked. He found her among hundreds of corpses when he returned. With the help of other villagers, he carried her to the Bangladesh border, where after two days they found a boatman who would take them across, for a fee. They paid 70,000 Burmese kyats ($46) and got her to a hospital.
After four months’ hospitalization, the doctors told her that even though her wounds had not healed, they could not keep her any longer. But at the refugee camp where she was sent, she was told she had missed registration and so was not entitled to rations. After concluding her story, Khalida slowly lifted her head and smiled at me. “Thank you,” she said. “Thank you for caring enough to come all the way from your country to visit us. Please come and see us again.”
Khalida’s story is repeated, in one form another, by hundreds of thousands of Rohingyas. I heard many accounts of rape, and I met Rohingyas whose eyes had been shot out and limbs blown off. People told me of others whose eyes had been gouged out, throats slit, and limbs hacked off. Advertisement
Just over a year ago, the Burma army unleashed its worst assault on the Rohingyas, leading to the most severe human-rights and humanitarian crisis in the country since independence in 1949. Over the following weeks, 700,000 Rohingyas were driven from their homes and forced to flee from Burma into Bangladesh. Thousands are believed to have been killed, and reports of mass rape are widespread. Accounts have emerged of babies being snatched from their mothers’ arms and thrown into a fire, families burned alive, villagers lined up and executed at gunpoint. Advertisement
A new United Nations report published this week accuses Burma’s top military generals, including the commander-in-chief, Min Aung Hlaing, of genocide in Rakhine State and, in Kachin and Shan States, of war crimes and crimes against humanity. The U.N.’s Independent International Fact-Fnding Mission has called for the generals to be prosecuted for actions that “undoubtedly amount to the gravest crimes under international law.” The U.N.’s outgoing high commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid Ra’ad al-Hussein, had already described the crisis as “a textbook example of ethnic cleansing,” and the U.N. special rapporteur on human rights in Burma, Yanghee Lee, warned of “the hallmarks of genocide.”
Yet what began a year ago today was not a new campaign, but an escalation in the decades-long persecution of the Rohingyas. In 1982, a new law stripped them of their citizenship rights, rendering them stateless in the land they had existed in for centuries. Their freedom of movement, access to education, ability to marry, and practice their religion has been severely restricted for years. Hostility from wider Burmese society is entrenched — even Burmese known for championing democracy and human rights regard the Rohingyas as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. To use the name by which Rohingyas identify themselves is a taboo in Burma — they are known as “Bengalis” or, by those trying to be more neutral, “Muslims in Rakhine State,” but never as Rohingyas. When I first visited the refugee camps in Bangladesh ten years ago, people told me: “The Burmese tell us ‘You are Bengali, go back to Bangladesh’; the Bangladeshis tell us ‘You are from Burma, go back to Burma.’ We are trapped between a crocodile and a snake.” Advertisement
In 2012, violence erupted between the predominantly Buddhist Rakhine and the Muslim Rohingyas, resulting in the displacement of thousands. Rohingyas were forced from their homes into displacement camps, which were described by U.N. officials as among the worst in the world. Those who remained in their homes did so under apartheid conditions. Advertisement Advertisement
In October 2016, the Burma army launched a major offensive, killing, raping, and displacing thousands. This should have served as a wake-up call to the international community to act, but the world’s failure to do so gave the military the green light to escalate even further. Crimes against humanity in the final months of 2016 were a mere prelude to ethnic cleansing a year later and perhaps genocide. A U.N. investigation was launched, a report was published, and Zeid Ra’ad al-Hussein called for accountability, but nothing happened. Advertisement
The repeated failure of the international community to act is already having consequences. Since the beginning of this year, the Burma army has significantly escalated its offensives against other ethnic groups in Burma, particularly the predominantly Christian Kachin and Buddhist Shan. Similar stories of rape, torture, the killing of civilians, and the burning of villages are emerging. A fragile ceasefire with the Karen people has been repeatedly violated.
In addition to grave crimes in the ethnic states, religious intolerance throughout the country has grown, driven by a militant Buddhist nationalist movement intent on promoting its version of Burman Buddhism and eliminating or at least subjugating any other belief. Hate speech is widespread, resulting in “Muslim free” villages and sporadic anti-Muslim violence. Christian pastors have been attacked and churches face severe restrictions. All this has been occurring for many years, but the intensity is increasing. Advertisement
The world’s reluctance to act is born primarily of a desire not to undermine Burma’s democratic transition, and of the fragile position of democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi. Of course the limitations she faces should not be ignored — the army, over which she has absolutely no control, directly runs three key ministries: home affairs, border affairs, and defense. Burma has, in effect, two governments: the limited, elected civilian government led by Suu Kyi, and the military. Nevertheless, democracy cannot be built on bloodshed, religious and ethnic hatred, crimes against humanity, and genocide. A democracy where such crimes occur with impunity, and where journalists and human-rights defenders who expose such crimes are jailed, is no democracy.
Action is long overdue. Burma’s generals should be referred to the International Criminal Court, or an alternative justice mechanism, as the U.N.’s investigation recommends. Carefully targeted sanctions should be imposed against the military, not the people, banning investment in military-owned enterprises, introducing a global arms embargo, and freezing the generals’ assets. The European Union has introduced some measures, and the United States’ Global Magnitsky Act has been triggered against a few individuals, but they do not go nearly far enough. The man ultimately responsible, General Min Aung Hlaing, has so far escaped all sanction. That must change. Advertisement
Urgent steps are also needed to counter hate speech, promote and protect freedom of religion or belief for all, and engage all stakeholders in a genuine, meaningful peace process to end decades of ethnic conflict and religious strife. Even though the major international actors are viewed with suspicion in Burma today, there may be some who are still trusted. Pope Francis’s visit to the country late last year might hold open the potential for the Vatican to play a meditation role. Unlike the U.N. or other governmental bodies, the Holy See may be seen to be relatively free of political baggage, although we should acknowledge that the current Church scandals may put that in jeopardy. Burma’s Cardinal Charles Bo is one of the very few national religious leaders respected by all sides.
Failure to end impunity sends the military a clear message: Continue these crimes, and all we will do is talk. The time for talk is over. If action is not taken now, to hold criminals accountable and at the same time to counter hatred and promote peace and reconciliation in a country torn apart by almost 70 years of civil war and ethnic hatred, Burma’s paralyzing wounds, like Khalida’s leg, will never heal.

5G Networks: Private Sector Must Lead | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Rick Boucher,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/5g-network-market-private-sector-must-lead/,"April 8, 2019 6:30 AM (Mario Anzuoni/Reuters) We won’t beat China by aping its command-and-control approach.
T here’s an interesting debate brewing on these pages between former House speaker Newt Gingrich and Federal Communications Commission (FCC) commissioner Brendan Carr on how to make the move to super-fast 5G wireless networks and how to protect America in the process.
By way of background, I founded the House Internet Caucus back when Gingrich was speaker. We didn’t see eye-to-eye on very much, but I welcomed his occasional interest in technology. Advertisement Advertisement
On this issue, though, he is wrong, and Commissioner Carr is right. The best — really the only — way to ensure the fastest possible deployment of 5G technology and to preserve American leadership in wireless is to follow the path that has driven American leadership in 4G. The private sector, not the government, must take the lead, and the primary government role should be to continue selling 5G spectrum to the private sector at auction.
In January of last year, it was reported that the Trump administration was considering, in effect, nationalizing at least part of the 5G spectrum by having one government-owned network. This poorly considered idea was rejected the very next day by the administration’s own FCC chairman, Ajit Pai. We all hoped that the notion had been squelched.
Now, however, Gingrich has revived the controversy, first with a piece widely interpreted as favoring nationalization and then in his response to Commissioner Carr here at NRO. In the latter article, Gingrich calls for a “public-private partnership [with] shared spectrum available for a carrier-neutral, wholesale-only, nationwide 5G network.” Advertisement Advertisement
While he suggests that the government-fostered wholesale network be built with private capital, he doesn’t say from where the money would come, and he clearly envisions a broad government role. What would that role be? How would a wholesale network work with multiple companies contributing to its construction and multiple carriers utilizing it for services? Gingrich doesn’t say, but if the rules for FCC spectrum auctions are complex and take too long to resolve, one can only imagine how difficult it would be to create rules for one network that multiple providers are supposed to finance and share.
Gingrich is preoccupied with the notion that Chinese companies will build 5G networks in other countries, arguing that to counter those efforts, we need government involvement in the development of our own 5G network. This leap of logic is particularly hard to comprehend because the major carriers in the U.S., with strong government urging, have already decided not to buy core wireless technology developed by Chinese companies. Our carriers today purchase routers and other hardware from providers outside of the U.S., including Nokia and Erickson, since no U.S. companies currently compete in that market. But the intelligent parts of the networks — the computer chips, software, and back-end operations — are already provided by leading American companies, including QUALCOMM, Juniper, and Cisco. Our government can and seems willing to prevent Chinese equipment providers from expanding into our market, and building a government network in the U.S. will do nothing to blunt Chinese expansion abroad.
Gingrich claims that a government-fostered national 5G network with shared access is necessary to unleash the power of deep liquid financial markets, enable market price discovery, and promote a culture of innovation. Those are exactly the virtues that have underpinned our wireless supremacy to date. Advertisement Advertisement
Our liquid financial markets powered the investments that enabled America to lead the world in 4G. As for market price discovery, that’s precisely what our spectrum auctions — the very thing Gingrich criticizes — accomplish. We have an unrivaled culture of innovation with a network that is the envy of the world and the platform for Google, Facebook, Amazon, and other edge providers that are among the world’s most innovative companies. Moving to a government-overseen network both is unnecessary and would put that success at risk.
Spectrum-sharing does not address any perceived need, nor would it appear to make the network more resilient or secure, or even offer a better platform on which for edge providers to innovate.
Gingrich is right in pointing to the painful absence of broadband in large swaths of rural America; innovative new approaches may be needed to address this urgent concern. A role for government in providing grants to rural electric and telephone cooperatives and other providers willing to build out may be a partial answer, but Gingrich is not proposing a rural-only solution, and creating a national, government-overseen 5G network doesn’t appear to offer obvious improvements, even for rural America. Advertisement
In short, major American commercial operators have the incentives they need to get to market quickly. They are not sitting on their hands and certainly not willingly ceding global leadership to China. This is not the time for the government to be in the market as a wholesaler to multiple companies whose systems are competing. That’s a recipe for confusion, slow deployments, potential additional points of failure, and the ceding of American leadership. Advertisement"
San Francisco's Decline: Failed Government Policies and Cultural Paralysis | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Michael Gibson,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/san-francisco-decline-failed-government-policies/,"April 8, 2019 6:30 AM (Stephen Lam/Reuters) The city by the bay has survived earthquakes and fires. Can it survive itself?
I t’s not what celebrants want to hear when the champagne is exploding out of shaken bottles of Dom, the confetti is falling, and their stock is up 8.7 percent at the market’s close, but I have an announcement to make: San Francisco is past its prime and the fires of creation have abated. Advertisement Advertisement
With all the millionaires newly minted by Lyft’s IPO, and with those set to be minted by Uber’s and Palantir’s and AirBnB’s, you might expect this enclave to become the next Babylon of American capitalism. While our moralists in the media — Nellie Bowles, Emily Chang, et al. — busily tsk-tsk the greed and the lust and the hypocrisy and the hubris, there is a story here they miss: The city’s current concentration of wealth likely doesn’t represent the beginning of a golden-if-sinful era, but the end.
Magnificent in the distance, San Francisco is now shockingly ugly up close. In the decade I have lived here, the city has achieved the seemingly impossible: It has combined the expensive and the bland and the appalling into a new form of decadence. To the untrained eye, it looks magical: a city of the future, a city of gasps. Then, slowly, it reveals itself to be a city of lies, one that dismisses the idea of city living.
The distant future Silicon Valley sells with the zeal of a crusader — all the lip service it pays to making the world a better place — shimmers like fool’s gold, monopolistic surveillance capitalism cloaked in the language of the common good. Billboards off the highway announce the coming of artificial intelligence as new nonprofits pop up to defend us against HAL and Skynet, but in reality “AI” is machine learning — pattern-recognition software parsing out subtle statistical connections to win board games and show you better ads. Advertisement
With a devilish consistency, this city sets you up for disappointment. Advertisement
Running a venture-capital fund that invests as early as possible in startups, I now see fewer and fewer companies choosing to come launch here. When we opened our doors in 2015, maybe 80 percent of our investments were in Bay Area companies. Last year, half of them were, and we expect to see that number decrease even more in the years ahead. Andreessen-Horowitz, the famed Silicon Valley VC firm, has announced that it’s becoming more or less a hedge fund, presumably to focus on later-stage opportunities. Peter Thiel, who had lived here since the mid 90s, has now decamped to Los Angeles, and says there is a less than 50 percent chance the next great tech company will arise in an increasingly expensive, conformist Silicon Valley.
“Silicon Valley is now more fashion than opportunity,” Thiel told the Swiss newspaper Zeitung . “The heads are the same.” Advertisement
Lack of independent thought aside, the Economist has identified the source of the problem: You can’t build a successful startup from a garage if a garage costs a million bucks. The flow of new creations is being choked off first and foremost because there are fewer cheap places for new things to start. Advertisement
The median rent for a one-bedroom apartment in San Francisco recently hit $3690 per month, 30 percent greater than in New York City. Over the last decade, the Bay Area has added 722,000 jobs but built only 106,000 new homes. Proposition M, passed in the 1980s to avoid “Manhattanization,” limits the supply of office space. The city’s average Class A asking rent has risen 124 percent since 2010 to over $80 per square foot.
The legendary urbanist Jane Jacobs once remarked that new ideas come from old buildings, the types of places you can alter without permission because no one cares about them. This is one reason why so many garage startups and garage bands and artists spilling paint in discarded warehouse lofts have left their mark on the world. The true creative class can’t afford to rent expensive new studios.
But in San Francisco, the true creative class can’t afford to rent any space anymore. Advertisement
The artists have fled. Sadie Valeri, an artist who has been painting and drawing in San Francisco for over 20 years, recently announced that she is closing her famed Potrero Hill atelier. “Our studio lease is ending,” she wrote in an email to her students last month. “And we have been informed that our rent will be increasing significantly to more than we can afford.”
There is no longer a San Francisco music scene, either. The house the Grateful Dead lived in at 710 Ashbury Street during their formative years in the 1960s is surrounded by Victorian townhouses that today sell for $3 million and more. A tourist review of the location puts it well: “Unless you knew who lived there, you wouldn’t know.” Advertisement
If you can stomach all that blandness, I wish you luck with the appalling. Up and down the city’s disorienting hills, you notice homeless men and women — junkies, winos, the dispossessed — passed out in the vestibules of empty storefronts on otherwise busy streets. Encampments of tents sprout in every shadowy corner: under highway overpasses, down alleys. Streets are peppered with used syringes. Strolling the sidewalks, you smell the faint malodorous traces of human excrement and soiled clothing. Crowded thoroughfares such as Market Street, even in the light of midday, stage a carnival of indecipherable outbursts and drug-induced thrashings about which the police seem to do nothing.
The confused mumble, the incoherent finger-pointing tirade, the twitch, the cold daemonic stare, the drunken stumble and drool — these are the rhythms of a city on the edge of a schizophrenic explosion. Advertisement
The cause of this blight is codified nostalgia and greed. (Nellie Bowles where are you?) Baby Boomer civil servants act as urban taxidermists stuffing and mounting a dead city so it always resembles the past. The San Francisco Chronicle tells us that there is indeed a mayor, and maybe even a chief of police, but it is not known who is actually in charge. Housing and zoning committees obscure responsibility for governance. But somewhere in the bureaucratic hierarchy faceless city functionaries administer labyrinthine regulations that benefit the rich over the poor, the old over the young, the here over those to come, the past over the future.
In one of the more comical examples of this sclerosis, a real-estate developer worked for five years and paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to show that a proposed housing development wouldn’t cast shadows on a nearby playground or destroy the historic character of the laundromat it sat atop. In another, it took two years for a woman to open an ice-cream shop.
And yet the days pass in a foggy calm. Coit Tower, the Painted Ladies, both bridges, and Alcatraz all stand serene. It is not a city of urgency and restless insomnia, not a city of any discernable power. It never roars like New York or snaps cold like Chicago. It is a pastel city that optimizes its sleep with a device. Advertisement
I’m not holding my breath for a revolution.
San Francisco has been overwhelmingly Democratic since the 1950s. The last Republican mayor won an election in 1956. It is a one-party city touting a civic philosophy with its back to the wall. From afar city Democrats pay lip service to helping the poor. But up close the facts tell a different story. None of their policies in the last half-century have done much to rescue the poor from poverty. Inflexible limits on the housing supply push marginalized groups even further to the margins. The stratospheric cost of housing has flung minority families to the outer edges of the Bay Area, reinforcing segregation. A UC Berkeley study found that a 30 percent increase in the median rent led to a 28 percent decrease in the number of minority households in a neighborhood. Whole neighborhoods from the city have decamped to the hinterlands of Antioch and Vallejo. Stories of three-hour commutes from Stockton have become more common.
Alas, the media seems to have never taken an economics class, much less read Paul Krugman. It is quite simply baffling. Housing restrictions have made the situation worse and worse for decades. No one seems to notice that the same debates play out time and again to no positive end. Instead, for commentary, reporters invariably trot out someone who disguises greed with the piety of a San Franciscan born and raised. Ah, those picturesque locals! Whatever sad story they tell, they shamelessly aim to limit the housing supply, inflating the prices of their own properties. Meanwhile, the media prints their moralistic scolding of the gentrifiers, i.e. anyone with an urge to build affordable housing. No one seems to care about the unseen: the people who never get to live here because the apartments they would live in aren’t ever built, the bookstores unopened, the dance steps untried, the poetry never recited because the rent’s too damn high.
Cities are nearly immortal; though they decline, they rarely die. But creative clusters can and do bite the dust. They are fragile, fleeting things. Rome survived the fall of a civilization and two world wars; Ancient Athens and Quattrocento Florence dazzled and faded. Now, San Francisco has passed its prime and settled into a sad late-middle age. Advertisement
“Cities that become dominated by a single industry, cities that reward generation of wealth and financial success over a sense of shared humanity and community have a hard time preserving social capital,” Sam Altman, the president of YCombinator, told the economist Tyler Cowen in a recent interview. “Where I grew up, no one would walk past a person collapsed on the side of the street on their way to work and not do something about it. I hope I never get used to the fact that that happens in San Francisco.”"
Questions for Jay Nordlinger on Some of His Most Frequent Subjects | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Jay Nordlinger,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/jay-nordlinger-questions-frequent-subjects/,"April 8, 2019 5:30 AM Former player Charles Barkley greets fans before a game in Auburn, Ala., in 2017. (Christopher Hanewinckel/USA TODAY Sports) A Q&A on some favorite subjects
I n a recent article , I spoke of “infield practice,” a term adopted by Bill Buckley. He used it to mean the asking and answering of basic questions. “I had a little infield practice with the BBC this morning on American conservatism.” That sort of thing.
Recently, a friend of mine gave me something akin to infield practice. She was hosting a dinner gathering, which was part of a series of such gatherings with various figures. Later, I asked her for a list of her questions. Do you want to go through them along with me? Advertisement Advertisement
The first section, she called “If Jay Were King.” I protested that I am a republican, small “r,” all the way. In any event, here are the questions in that section.
What grammatical error would you make vanish?
Well, I’ve noticed something lately — like the last five years. Young people around me say, “If I would have known it was going to be cold, I would have worn a sweater.” “If he would have been there on time, he would have met her.” Advertisement
How did this creep in? Whatever the case, I would like to see it creep out.
Also, there’s the perennial “between you and I.” In general, people don’t know how to use “I” and “me.” Because of this ignorance, or uncertainty, they fall back (incorrectly) on “myself.” Blech. Advertisement
Furthermore, there’s this: People say, “This is one of those things that bothers me.” They think the verb goes with the “one.” Actually, it goes with “those things”: “This is one of those things that bother me.”
Buckley was a stickler for this. In my presence — on separation occasions — he corrected two eminent writers on this score! (Both were longtime friends of his, I hasten to add.)
What dictator would you topple? Advertisement
I would not want to topple one who would just be succeeded by someone equally bad. But — my mind runs to Syria and North Korea. They are the two worst places on earth, almost certainly. The Assads, father and son, have ruled since 1970. The Kims, father, son, and grandson, have ruled since right after World War II.
Bashar has killed so many. He has killed more than his father — no slouch in this department — ever dreamed of. I would give Bashar my vote. Gone. Advertisement
But it’s hard to vote against Kim (any of them).
To whom would you give the Nobel Peace Prize?
Ah. Good question. (My hostess asked it because I wrote a history of the prize, Peace, They Say .) I would like to give it to a Cuban democracy leader: Dr. Óscar Elías Biscet, say. Or the Ladies in White, collectively.
Speaking of “White”: I would also give the prize to the White Helmets, the Syrian civil-defense group. They try to rescue people from the rubble. They risk life and limb to do so. Naturally, they are subject to the worst Russian, Iranian, and other propaganda. Great and noble people.
O kay, the next section, my hostess titled “Either-Or.”
Mozart or Beethoven?
I’m sorry, I can’t. I just can’t. I hate to be a party pooper — but it’s impossible. I can say this: I think of the composers as a group, a family, if you will. I think of the Founding Fathers the same way. There are partisans where the Founders are concerned: Jeffersonians versus Hamiltonians, for example. I never get into that. I think of them as a group, with each one vital, and I’m grateful for them all.
The same is true of the great composers: Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert, and so on. They belong to one another. They talk to one another. They borrow from one another (or the later ones borrow from the earlier ones). They build on one another. They interlock. Advertisement
Gun to my head, I’d probably say Bach, for reasons we can get into another time …
The Gershwin brothers or Rodgers & Hammerstein?
Ooh, that is cruel — almost as cruel as the previous question. I’m going to have to duck this one too. Who would want to live without either pair? All those songs that flowed from those guys …
I am sitting here trying to pull the trigger. I am trying and trying. I just can’t. Maybe I can put this another way, leaving songs and lyricists out of it: Gershwin has meant a lot more to me in my life than Rodgers has, much as I love the latter, too.
Lenny or André? Advertisement Advertisement
She means Leonard Bernstein or André Previn. I wrote about Bernstein on the occasion of his centennial last year ( here ). I wrote about Previn after he passed away in February ( here ). They were a lot alike: Americans who could do it all, musically. They composed (both classical and popular music), they conducted, and they played the piano. They did all of these things at a very high level. Also, they could talk and write like pros. They wrote prose like pros.
Gifted sons-of-guns.
André was the better jazz pianist. He also did more of it than Bernstein did. Classical division? Probably a tie, though André may have the edge. Composing? Well, Bernstein wrote West Side Story , case closed. Classical division? Lenny probably has the edge there too (though I should think further about this).
Conducting? They were both great conductors, and different from each other, but you have to give Bernstein the edge, though you really don’t want to do the ranking at all …
Incidentally, I have just been writing about Thomas Adès, the British musician born in 1971. Like Bernstein and Previn, he is a triple threat: composer, conductor, pianist. Gifted son-of-a-gun. Advertisement
T he next section, my hostess called “Favorite Things.”
Favorite interview?
Well, if I could name a class, it would probably be dissidents, democracy leaders, former political prisoners (and political-prisoners-to-be). They are astonishing. I have interviewed presidents and prime ministers (and kings). Sopranos, golfers, Nobelists. A constant, motley parade. I would have to name the dissidents, the freedom fighters, as a class.
And I would further single out the North Koreans — the defectors, the escapees. Mind-blowing. Also Sharansky.
Favorite freedom fighter?
Ah! We were just on the subject …
Frankly, they are a lot alike: in every clime, in every era, of whatever language, no matter the dictatorship they are fighting. They are a lot alike: gutsy, reckless, principled, absurdly brave — sometimes hard to understand. Sometimes not so likable. Always admirable.
I could not name one or two. But — maybe to say it again — Sharansky was, and, is, something.
Favorite WFB-ism?
For the uninitiated, “WFB” stands for William F. Buckley Jr. He would sometimes say, “Beat that .” He would point out something remarkable, or someone else would, and he would say, “Beat that .”
Also, he once said to me, in reference to one of his spaniels, “Isn’t that the sweetest dog in the history of dogs?” I picked up this formulation. Many years ago, I texted a friend of mine, saying, “I’ve just met the most beautiful girl in the history of girls.” I have sent the same text to him — the identical text — in the ensuing years. My friend will occasionally say, “So, who’s the most beautiful girl in the history of girls? Who’s the incumbent?”
Favorite Mark Helprin book?
There are so many. I think I will nominate … In Sunlight and in Shadow , a blockbuster romance. Enthralling.
Favorite child of a monster?
Several years ago, I wrote a book called “ Children of Monsters: An Inquiry into the Sons and Daughters of Dictators .” I would have to say Svetlana Stalin. I give chapter and verse in my book. She did the best she could to overcome her parentage and upbringing. She was dealt an extraordinary hand — you wouldn’t have wished it on anybody — and she did her best to play it in some reasonable way. Fascinating woman.
Favorite presidential campaign?
Hmmm. Let me name three, please — three presidential years. First, 1860 — Lincoln against those other three. It mattered greatly. Crucially. Second, 1912 — fascinating race: the president (Taft), the ex-president (Theodore Roosevelt), Wilson, and Debs. Third, 1980, mainly because the election left an imprint on me, in my coming of age. (I was 16.)
T he last section, Cristina labeled, “Google This.”
Leontyne Price track?
Oh, there are so many. She sang everything from Monteverdi until yesterday. She sang every type of song, in every language, and a huge range of opera roles. I could give you a Handel aria. I could give you a Strauss song. I could give you spirituals.
Well, how about a Puccini aria, from a little-known opera called “Edgar”? Pretty damn good .
Clip from The Simpsons ? Advertisement
Oh! I cherish the Simpsons playing Scrabble . Homer has on his rack before him “OXIDIZE.” He says, “How could anyone make a word out of these lousy letters?” Then he plays “do.” Etc.
Also, I cherish the Simpsons’ outing to the opera : Carmen .
Moment in golf?
Well, let me name a victory: Jack Nicklaus’s triumph in the Masters, 1986. The last time. I watched in my dorm room. That was an amazing, emotional Sunday afternoon. I was almost ridiculously happy. The very next Sunday afternoon, I watched Vladimir Horowitz, in his return to Moscow. Similar sort of thing, frankly. (Triumph over age, for example.)
I don’t think I have ever had another two such Sundays in a row …
Charles Barkley moment?
You ever heard him pick on the women of San Antonio? (Not pick them up , but pick on them.) One of the most delightful long-running gags in America. Even the women of San Antonio — comely, all, no doubt — must smile a bit. (Try here .)
L ast year, I wrote a feature called “ Death Row Meals .” That was really a stand-in for favorite meals. What would be your last supper, so to speak? The answers, from readers, were very interesting, and even moving (in addition to appetizing).
At our gathering the other night, Cristina asked each guest for his “Death Row meal.” One of the purest answers was “a good French baguette and excellent cheese.” There were more elaborate answers, naturally."
USS Harry S. Truman Retirement a Terrible Idea | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Seth Cropsey,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/uss-harry-s-truman-aircraft-carrier-retirement-terrible-idea/,"April 8, 2019 5:30 AM USS Harry S. Truman transits the Atlantic Ocean, December 12, 2018. (Mass Communication Specialist Second Class Scott Swofford/US Navy) The Navy needs to keep it while increasing its fleet of aircraft carriers.
T he Pentagon wants to reduce the Navy’s carrier fleet. In testimony before the House Armed Services Committee on March 26, Acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan said that aircraft carriers remain “vital” to the United States’ security. Shanahan also insisted that a carrier, the USS Harry S. Truman , which needs refueling for its nuclear reactor so that it can stay in the U.S. fleet for another 25 years, should be tied up to save money for the “future force.” The two assertions are contradictory. “Future force” includes unmanned planes that would fly from carrier decks. Laying up the Truman would reduce the carrier fleet below its congressionally mandated level of eleven, which U.S. combatant commanders say is insufficient to meet their requirements. Cutting the carrier force would undercut the rationale for investing in future technology — for example, unmanned planes. Advertisement
The large problem is that the military service best suited to deter China’s regional and global ambitions — the U.S. Navy — is not being funded at a level commensurate with the reemergence of great-power competition. The U.S. needs both enough ships to meet its global commitments and advanced technology to equip them. Cutting either to fund the other is like giving up your health insurance to replace a leaking roof.
Arguments for retiring the Truman stand up neither to facts nor to reason. The cost savings from failing to refuel the Truman in the fiscal year that begins this October would be no more than $17 million. Greater savings would accrue in later years. They amount, in constant dollars, to less than 75 percent of the Truman ’s original cost — a lot of money, but worth it to keep the carrier fleet at the absolute minimum needed to meet the U.S.’s peacetime commitments in the Middle East and Indo-Pacific. Advertisement
Another ailment to which Pentagon leadership has succumbed is the selectively applied notion that large deck ships are particularly vulnerable to Chinese missiles, whose unproven capability is believed to threaten aircraft carriers and large amphibious ships underway at sea as far as 2,500 miles distant. “Selectively applied” is an appropriate description because Pentagon leadership has also agreed to buy two Ford-class aircraft carriers to be built simultaneously, thereby saving $4 billion dollars. This is a good deal for which the Pentagon deserves credit, but is the Truman more vulnerable than the two future carriers?
No argument exists to support that it is. The Navy already possesses late-model missiles that can defend against cruise and ballistic missiles. The U.S. Air Force long since demonstrated its ability to launch intermediate-range ballistic missiles at land targets from the air. This ability can be updated to threaten Chinese anti-ship missile batteries. A straightforward answer to Chinese missiles, as they present an increasing threat to ships underway at sea, is to invest in unmanned aerial vehicles whose range is much greater than that of manned aircraft and then to change the composition of planes aboard aircraft carriers so that they can launch strikes out of range of China’s missiles. That investment should not be made at the expense of a ship that can carry new unmanned combat aircraft. In any event, the back-and-forth of new weapons answered by newer ones does not end with China’s anti-ship missiles. Advertisement Advertisement
No less important, the Navy has been experiencing serious problems with repairs, maintenance, and training because of growing demands on its fleet. Former Pacific Command commander Admiral Sam Locklear told the House Armed Services Committee five years ago that the U.S. Central and Pacific Commands could not meet their obligations with the eleven existing carriers. Tying up the Truman would cut the number of carriers to ten, from its congressionally mandated requirement of eleven. It would idle shipyard workers whose skills cannot be turned on and off like a fan, thereby further harming the U.S.’s industrial base. It would nullify President Trump’s promise to expand the Navy to include “having the twelve-carrier Navy we need.”
The threatened aircraft carrier’s namesake, Harry S. Truman, was a self-taught historian who once observed that “there is nothing new in the world except the history that you do not know.” The lesson on which American defense planners have lost their grip is that weakness, in this case the diminished ability to bring powerful forces to bear swiftly, is an invitation to bad behavior from a foe. China insists that taking Taiwan by force remains an option and continues to increase the amphibious fleet required for that objective, along with its aggressive deployments of air and naval forces around Taiwan. Reducing the U.S. carrier fleet today is like lighting a campfire in a drought-stricken forest. Advertisement
But the bottom line here is the defense budget’s bottom line. This administration’s defense-budget increases are prudent and necessary but insufficient. They will help end the unreadiness that the previous administration’s defense cuts created. They will not build up the U.S. military at the rate needed to address the re-emergent great-power competition that the Trump administration correctly identifies. Achieving the Trump administration’s original goal of a twelve-carrier fleet would require building a new aircraft carrier every three years. At that rate, Navy could have a twelve-carrier fleet by 2030 — at the earliest. (Many of the existing eleven carriers would be retired as new ones come on line.) The Defense Department has no plan for this. Advertisement
VIEW SLIDESHOW: USS Harry S. Truman Advertisement
The administration’s budgets will not substantially ameliorate what the 2017 congressionally mandated commission on the national-defense strategy identified as “a crisis of national security for the United States” that is “undermining deterrence of U.S. adversaries and the confidence of American allies, thus increasing the likelihood of conflict.” They will not reverse what the current commander of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, Admiral Phil Davidson, told the Senate Armed Services Committee in April last year: that “there is no guarantee that the U.S. would win a future conflict with China.” Of course, there is no guarantee of anything in a conflict, but this statement by the officer responsible for American forces in the Indo-Pacific is a powerful warning against the less capable Navy that the U.S. will have if USS Truman leaves the fleet.
The most apt parallel to our current situation is the one that Britain faced in the 1930s. China should not be compared to Nazi Germany, but the responses of British and American leadership to strategic danger bear examination. Up until it was too late to deter war, the British political class saw appeasement as an acceptable answer to Hitler’s increasing aggression. They dismissed the idea that Britain was in a political struggle with Germany. Accede enough and the Germans will be satisfied, they thought. This is parallel to our decades-long hope that integrating China into the global economic system would make Chinese leadership “stakeholders” in the world order. Appeasing Germany failed for Britain. Using inclusion to moderate China has failed for us.
Comparisons between Britain’s experience and our policy today do not stop here. Today’s perception is that the British sat on their hands as Germany armed. This misses the mark. After dipping slightly between 1930 and 1933, the U.K.’s defense budget increased by 128.8 percent from 1934 to 1939, the year that World War II began. Winston Churchill’s reviled trio of British leaders, Ramsay MacDonald, Stanley Baldwin, and Neville Chamberlain, held the premiership during that five-year military buildup during which the defense budget increased by an average of 29.9 percent per year. It was not enough. The Germans seized the continent, drove the British off it, and inflicted devastation on London and other major cities. Advertisement"
Antonin Scalia’s ‘On Faith’: A Suggestion for Harried People | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Kathryn Jean Lopez,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/antonin-scalia-on-faith-advice-harried-people/,"April 8, 2019 5:30 AM Antonin Scalia in 2010 (Kevin Lamarque/Reuters) We all could use a retreat.
A ntonin Scalia didn’t get into Princeton University. That’s one of the many things I didn’t necessarily expect to learn reading On Faith : Lessons from an American Believer , a new collection of reflections and speeches by and about the late Supreme Court justice.
He brought it up during a 1998 talk to a group of students at his alma mater, Georgetown University. He used it as an example of trusting the hand of Providence and not being stubborn about your own will. He trusted he was a “better” man than he might have been had his own will — going to Princeton — been done. For every disappointment in life, not just college admissions, it’s something worth keeping in mind. It’s important if you’re a person “who believes in the transcendental.” Advertisement
And if you say you do, and can’t quite keep that perspective, it’s probably long past time you get yourself on a retreat. “If you don’t have a weekend to spare once a year to think exclusively about the things that really matter — well, then you haven’t planned your life correctly,” Scalia insisted, perhaps knowing what most of us would be thinking right about now.
That was Scalia’s pitch back on campus. And thanks to this new volume, which is full of discourses on the law, courage, vocation, and moments of grave moral concerns (such as the Holocaust), it’s his pitch to us, too. Advertisement
“Maybe now more than ever” may be an overused phrase, but it applies here, for a time-out is needed in many of our lives. How many of us can even get through a traditional newspaper column without being tempted, or simply unable to resist, the urge to go check our phone for something — anything — potentially new? Everyone knows about “fake news”; how about the needless, repetitious information that we voluntarily submit ourselves to daily and that we even form what sound to be strong, emotional opinions about? Some of it is no better than gossip. Most of it not only has no positive effect on our lives, it also takes us away from the people and needs around us that should demand our attention. It’s a never-ending reality-television show that keeps trumping itself (and no, it’s not only the president!) for new plot lines. Advertisement
Retreat may sound like an escape, but it’s actually more like a reboot. The culture could use one right about now. So the least we could each do is consider giving it a try. Advertisement
I had to laugh at a number of points while reading the Scalia talk, remembering his fearless wit. The last time I saw him, he was taking on Thomas Aquinas in a room full of Thomists. Before getting into his Georgetown talk, he nudges the organizers a wee bit: He has been asked to talk about his values, but he actually detests the term, “which suggests to me a greater degree of interchangeability than ought to exist — as though the principles that guide a man’s life are something like monetary exchange rates, subject to change with the times. (As in: ‘The value of the yen has fallen.’)”
His point about values is a point about the crisis of our times: identity. What are the reasons for our lives? What are the hills we’d be willing to die on? As Scalia put it, “because the world believes in the pragmatic rather than the transcendental, and you will lose your soul (that is to say, forget what and who you are) if you do not get away from the noise now and then to think about the First Things.” Advertisement
Joe Biden isn’t the first person you might think of in the context of Justice Scalia, but the recent flak he’s gotten for his personal-space issues is not unrelated. As the Democrats who want to be president keep tripping over themselves to be the most radical on issues that hit on the most fundamental things — such as human life itself — Biden is someone who, at critical moments, has been a little voice of conscience. I think of a news story about him pushing back in an Obama-administration White House meeting where the mandate that would ultimately force the Little Sisters of the Poor to the Supreme Court came up. He was shot down and subsequently became a chief spokesman for the conscience squeeze by the administration. But I can’t help but think that if we had more people with the long view in politics — who knew who they were and kept that in focus — a lot of his decisions along the way could have made for a different kind of politics. He’s a man who has suffered, and there may be a wisdom there that our current politics just can’t handle tapping into. Advertisement"
News Consumers: Be Wary of Mainstream Media that Appeals to Niches | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Jay Cost,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/news-consumers-media-outlets-appeal-niches/,"April 8, 2019 5:30 AM President Trump speaks to reporters outside the White House, April 5, 2019. (Joyce N. Boghosian/White House) It is hard to differentiate between truth and falsehood.
R ecently I had occasion to speak to a group of high-school students about how to consume news. Young people inhabit a very strange universe — completely unfamiliar to those of us aged 35 or older. Most of these kids get their information about the world from YouTube, Instagram, or Twitter, and it is often of very dubious quality (a recent article from T he Atlantic offers a chilling example ). My advice to these students was to keep their heads on a swivel. The media landscape has changed dramatically over the last quarter century, it is still obviously in flux, and right now it is hard to differentiate between truth and falsehood. That is especially true for young people, who do not have the experiential compass to point them in the right direction. Advertisement Advertisement
Young people are suffering from a more acute version of a chronic problem that is plaguing all of us. Where do we go for reliable information? The mainstream press has touted itself as the tonic to President Donald Trump’s tendency to misrepresent the truth, but as we have seen time and again over the last two years, the press is prone to hyperbole, bias, and yes, lies of its own.
A case in point came from the ironically titled “Reliable Sources,” CNN’s show about the news business. David Zurawik of the Baltimore Sun derided Trump for spreading mistruths, which “drives” the press “to exhaustion,” which is the “way dictators win.” Advertisement
Nonsense on stilts. It should go without saying that “dictators win” by imprisoning or murdering their political opponents, denying citizens their natural liberties, and suspending free elections — none of which Trump has done.
This sort of hyperbole is common on the cable networks — on both sides of the ideological spectrum. It’s also a regular subtext of the New York Times (which by the way is doing pretty well amid the dictatorship of Trump) and the Washington Post , outlets that continue to claim to be neutral arbiters of capital-T Truth. Advertisement
It is easy to cast aspersions upon biased journalists who claim to be unbiased, or on commentators like Zurawik who seem to have lost their wits in the Age of Trump. And no doubt: Liberals can point to just as many examples of tendencies on the right. Hypocrisy and irrationality are easy targets for criticism, regardless of your ideological preferences. But I think all of us — conservatives and liberals, Republicans and Democrats — need to reckon with the underlying problem driving the news industry: Nobody has much of an economic incentive to offer truly straight reporting anymore. Instead, most of the major players are trying to appeal to a niche, even as they continue to claim to be offering news for everybody.
Market niches can be very useful. They encourage specialization among suppliers and greater satisfaction among buyers. But news niches built around ideological preferences undermine the larger goal of the industry to hold power accountable. Certain facts are emphasized, others are elided, conjecture is used to fill in the spaces left between facts, panel discussions are one-sided, and so on. All of this is done to appeal to the target audience, which makes sense economically but creates the negative externality of a national discourse devoid of a common set of facts and a reliable judge of what is and is not True. Advertisement
The world in which many of us grew up, one where the news industry was taken as basically objective, looks in retrospect to have been a wrinkle in time — a brief era after World War II when newspaper consolidation in the major cities and the rise of the big-three networks limited the number of suppliers, and created a market environment in which the best economic strategy was to appeal to people of all ideological stripes. That just doesn’t exist anymore. The proliferation of media suppliers means that any consumer can get his news presented in a way that appeals to his ideological priors, and while slogans trumpeting ideological neutrality (“Fair and Balanced,” “Democracy Dies in Darkness,” “All the News That’s Fit to Print”) persist, hardly anyone takes them seriously — and those who do tend to think that half the country is a bunch of anti-American lying liars who need to be defeated.

"Pete Buttigieg, 2020 Democratic Candidate, Challenges Vice President Mike Pence's View on Gay Marriage | National Review",www.nationalreview.com,Jack Crowe,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/news/pete-buttigieg-challenges-pences-views-on-gay-marriage/,"April 8, 2019 9:09 AM South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg greets voters during a campaign stop in Portsmouth, N.H., March 8, 2019. (Brian Snyder/Reuters)
Pete Buttigieg, the openly gay mayor of Southbend, Ind., on Sunday challenged Vice President Mike Pence’s traditional Christian views on sexuality and said that his marriage to a man has brought him “closer to God.” “Being married to Chasten has made me a better human being because it has made me more compassionate, more understanding, more self-aware and more decent,” he said at the LGBTQ Victory Fund’s annual brunch. “My marriage to Chasten has made me a better man. And yes, Mr. Vice President, it has moved me closer to God,” he added to applause.
Pence has long opposed gay marriage due to his belief in the traditional Christian conception of marriage as a union between one man and one woman.
In 2004, while serving as a Congressman representing Indiana, Pence co-sponsored a proposed Constitutional amendment that would enshrine heterosexual marriage as the only permissible form of marriage in the U.S. He also voted against repealing the “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy that required gay service members to conceal their sexual orientation.
Buttigieg, who is running for the Democratic presidential nomination, went on to argue that any opposition to his identity as a gay man translates into opposition to God.
“That’s the thing that I wish the Mike Pences of the world would understand,” he said. “That if you have a problem with who I am, your problem is not with me. Your quarrel, sir, is with my creator.”
The Navy veteran then attacked the Trump administration’s attempts to ban transgender people from the military."
Time to Confirm New Leadership at the EEOC | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Carrie Lukas,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/time-to-confirm-new-leadership-at-the-eeoc/,"About Carrie Lukas April 8, 2019 12:19 PM
The Senate’s challenge in approving nominees has affected multiple agencies, but the problem is particularly bad at the EEOC.
Last year, I noted in the Wall Street Journal that vacancies at the EEOC had left the Democrat commissioners as the majority of what is supposed to be a five person, bipartisan commission. Now, since the Democratic chairwoman’s term expired, the EEOC commission lack a quorum so is unable to act. Advertisement Advertisement
As a result, the EEOC has been unable to provide guidance on important regulatory matters, including how to structure health and wellness plans while remaining in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act. The EEOC also hasn’t been able to respond to a federal judge’s decision to reinstate an Obama-era rule requiring extensive new data collection. That requirement would create significant costs for businesses large and small, and, as IWF argued here , could backfire by discouraging employers from offering more flexible, individualize arrangements to their employees in favor of a more standardized compensation system. That’s bad news for working women in particular."

Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders said Sunday that he opposes open borders, because such a policy would cause migrants from poverty-stricken parts of the world to flood into the U.S.
The Vermont senator corrected an audience member at a town hall in Oskaloosa, Iowa, who described him as “an advocate for open borders” and asked him how the U.S. would be able to fund health care and other services while also embracing such a policy.
“I’m afraid you may be getting your information wrong. That’s not my view,” Sanders responded. “What we need is comprehensive immigration reform.”
“If you open the borders, my God, there’s a lot of poverty in this world, and you’re going to have people from all over the world,” he continued. “I don’t think that’s something that we can do at this point. Can’t do it. So that is not my position.” Stay Updated with NR Daily

Sanders, who has yet to release his official immigration proposal, has long backed a pathway to citizenship for so-called Dreamers, undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children by their parents.
In the summer of 2015, during his first presidential run, the 76-year-old senator even pinned the policy of open borders on the other side of the aisle."
Yujing Zhang & Mar-a-Lago -- Espionage Is Supposed to Be More Difficult Than This | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Jim Geraghty,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/espionage-is-supposed-to-be-more-difficult-than-this/,"April 8, 2019 5:10 PM Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Fla.

Back in the 1970s, the CIA developed what we would now call a drone that was designed to be disguised as a dragonfly , called the “Insectothopter.” According to Spycraft: The Secret History of the CIA’s Spytechs, from Communism to al-Qaeda , there is a DARPA model of a similar surveillance device no larger than horsefly.
The Chinese woman who was arrested after gaining entry to President Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort almost succeeded with a much simpler approach: Just carry around a thumb drive and wait for the authorities who arrest you to plug it into their computers .
The Secret Service agent who questioned Ms. Zhang after her arrest, Samuel Ivanovich, said during testimony that she did not carry any lock-picking or eavesdropping gear. His four-and-a-half hour interrogation of Ms. Zhang was recorded by video, Mr. Ivanovich said, but it lacked sound because he didn’t realize that the agency’s office in Palm Beach didn’t have that capability.
Mr. Ivanovich testified that the computer analyst who reviewed Ms. Zhang’s devices said that the thumb drive she was carrying had immediately begun installing a program on his computer.
“He stated that he had to immediately stop the analysis and shut off his computer to halt the corruption,” Mr. Ivanovich said.
First, who outfits an interrogation room with video recording but not audio recording?
Second, what computer analyst puts a thumb drive from a suspected spy into a computer and doesn’t expect malware?"
Media Coverage of Southern Poverty Law Center Illustrates Key Truths | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,David French,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/southern-poverty-law-center-media-coverage/,"April 8, 2019 5:45 PM Morris Dees in a Southern Poverty Law Center video (SPLC/via YouTube)
Over the weekend, Jim Tharpe, the former managing editor of the Montgomery Advertiser , the Southern Poverty Law Center’s hometown newspaper, published an important piece in the Washington Post highlighting his own long experience with SPLC corruption. The entire piece is worth a read, but I want to highlight a key section: More than two decades ago, I was managing editor of the Montgomery Advertiser , which was located one block from the SPLC in downtown Montgomery , Ala. I proposed an investigation into the organization after ongoing complaints from former SPLC staffers, who came and went with regularity but always seemed to tell the same story. Only the names and faces changed. The SPLC, they said, was not what it appeared to be. Many urged the newspaper to take a look. We were, at the time, anything but adversaries with the center. Like other media outlets, we generally parroted SPLC press releases. We also became friends with SPLC staffers, occasionally attending the center’s parties. Some of my reporters dated staffers at the center. That relationship, however, suddenly soured when reporters Dan Morse and Greg Jaffe (both of whom now work for The Post) began making serious inquiries about the SPLC’s finances and the treatment of black employees. In 1994, the Advertiser published the results of its investigation and exposed — a quarter-century before the SPLC’s current crisis — systematic financial misdeeds and racial tensions at the civil-rights law firm. Yet the reports had little effect on the organization’s national reputation. It kept raising money, and national media kept using the SPLC’s questionable research to discredit reputable individuals and organizations as hateful, bigoted, or “ extremist. ” I took three important things from Tharpe’s piece. First, independent local media is indispensable. There is no substitute for local knowledge and personal experience. For the Advertiser , the SPLC wasn’t a distant organization with a reputation centered around its idealistic mission, it was a very human organization with a building down the street. Its reporters were close enough to see the smoke. They knew to look for a fire. Second, truly independent reporting requires moral courage. Note the middle paragraph. Not only does it betray a degree of ideological sympathy with the SPLC, it demonstrates how personal relationships can make effective reporting more difficult. It’s harder to investigate an organization and evaluate it fairly when intimate relationships are at stake. Yet the Advertiser did it anyway. That took guts. Third, ideological sympathy can blind mainstream organizations to known facts. It’s not like the Advertiser’s report simply disappeared into the ether. The series was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize, but it had little discernible impact either on national reporting about the SPLC or national acceptance of its conclusions and arguments. The SPLC’s problems were one of the worst-kept secrets in public interest law, and its insatiable greed should have red-flagged all of its public arguments as suspect. It was in the business of sensationalism. Yet all too many reporters, pundits, and activists swallowed its conclusions whole. I hope the SPLC’s reckoning will result in a sober reassessment of its legacy and a reconsideration of its targets. I hope that the SPLC’s moral collapse means the end of its public credibility. But, sadly, I’m not holding my breath. Too many activists and members of the media share the SPLC’s hatreds and biases. So its labels may well endure, lumping in good people with the truly vile. The damage — to individual reputations and to our public discourse — is done. Too bad more people didn’t read the words of Alabama reporters two decades ago. The SPLC may have been forced to reform well before it caused so much harm."
Bradford Wilcox & Lyman Stone -- Atlantic Piece Shows Sexual Liberation Isn't All that Liberating | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,David French,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/it-turns-out-that-sexual-liberation-isnt-all-that-liberating/,"April 8, 2019 3:39 PM (Brendan McDermid/Reuters)
Over at The Atlantic , Bradford Wilcox and Lyman Stone have penned a fascinating piece exploring the roots of American unhappiness and tying it our nation’s “ sex recession ” — a rather marked decrease in sexual activity by young adults. As Wilcox and Stone note:
The share of young adults having sex at least once a week has fallen from 59 percent in 1972 to 49 percent in 2018. This decline is far steeper among men: down from 58 percent of young men having sex at least weekly in 2010 to just 43 percent in 2018. And the share of young adults reporting no sex in the past year has risen as well, now at 22 percent for young men and 14 percent for young women in 2018.
While Wilcox and Stone are focused on the frequency of sex as a key indicator of happiness (indeed, they argue that “ changes in sexual frequency can account for about one-third of the decline in happiness since 2012 and almost 100 percent of the decline in happiness since 2014 ” ), I want to pull out two other important facts from their piece. First, here they are discussing the link between marriage and happiness:
Controlling for basic demographics and other social characteristics, married young adults are about 75 percent more likely to report that they are very happy, compared with their peers who are not married, according to our analysis of the GSS, a nationally representative survey conducted by NORC at the University of Chicago. As it turns out, the share of young adults who are married has fallen from 59 percent in 1972 to 28 percent in 2018.
And second, here they are describing the role of religious practice:
Young adults who attend religious services more than once a month are about 40 percent more likely to report that they are very happy, compared with their peers who are not religious at all, according to our analysis of the GSS. (People with very infrequent religious attendance are even less happy than never-attenders; in terms of happiness, a little religion is worse than none.) What’s happening to religious attendance among young adults today? The share of young adults who attend religious services more than monthly has fallen from 38 percent in 1972 to 27 percent in 2018, even as the share who never attend has risen rapidly.
Why is this so interesting? For generations, key elements of our cultural and academic elite have been arguing essentially the opposite — that liberation from religion and liberation from marriage were prerequisites to true human flourishing. If you asked an early era sexual revolutionary for his prediction for a culture with profoundly less religious practice, less marriage, and many fewer moral restraints on sexual practice, I sincerely doubt that he’d respond that he believed that culture would be less happy, with people having less sex. That’s certainly not the dominant message of Hollywood, which for years has portrayed religion as mainly negative and marriage as all too often dreary, contentious, and sexless.
Ask yourself, how many happy, sexually vibrant religious married couples have you seen on popular television shows or movies — even in this era of fragmented, targeted entertainment? Compare that with the number of times you’ve seen rebellion from religion glorified and religious leaders mocked and despised. And while marriage fares better on the big and small screens, single people are generally portrayed as so sexually active that they behave unlike virtually anyone you’ve ever known. The collective message that’s been delivered is something like this — singleness is exciting, religion is oppressive, and marriage is where you “ settle down ” (sometimes for good, sometimes for ill).

The AP writes that many left-of-center American Jews are deeply disturbed by Bibi Netanyahu’s close relationship with Donald Trump .
(That close relationship certainly complicates the “Trump’s a Nazi” accusation, doesn’t it? Almost as much as the existence of Jared Kushner. A better and more accurate criticism is that a bunch of vocal and hideous anti-Semites seem convinced that Trump is on their side , despite the contrary evidence, making you wonder what those anti-Semites are seeing and hearing in Trump to stir their passions. Then again, some of these same voices are cheering for Rep. Ilhan Omar these days.) Advertisement Advertisement
Are American Jews really all that surprised that Netanyahu sees an enormous opportunity in Trump’s presidency and has a better relationship with the current president than with the Democratic alternatives? What, did they think the Israeli Prime Minister was going to cheer the Iran deal? Is anyone surprised that Netanyahu isn’t feeling as close to the American Democratic Party as he used to, with the likes of Omar and Rashida Tlaib on the scene? Stay Updated with NR Daily

Don’t get mad at Netanyahu for responding to the incentives that were placed in front of him. The Obama administration wanted him to go along with an Iranian deal that Netanyahu saw as enormously dangerous to his country. John Kerry and Susan Rice openly denounced him when he wouldn’t play ball. There was no way the Obama administration was going to give up on the Iran deal, and there was no way Netanyahu and the Israeli defense establishment was ever going to accept the Iran deal.

We Have Bigger Problems to Tackle than Culture-War Politics | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Jim Geraghty,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/the-morning-jolt/we-have-bigger-problems-to-tackle-than-culture-war-politics/,"Follow Jim Geraghty on Twitter April 9, 2019 10:04 AM Making the click-through worthwhile: From the nation’s airports to Congress to the 2020 campaign trail, headline-grabbing culture-war spats arise, squeezing out discussion of more substantive and difficult issues; two New York Times reporters warn the political-journalism world that the debates that occur on Twitter do not reflect real life in America; and an unveiling of a new batch of data about the gun industry in each U.S. state. The More Time You Spend on Culture-War Politics, The Less You Focus on Other Problems The editors observe that “Chick-fil-A faces explicit, official retaliation [by government agencies] not for any incidents of discrimination in its stores, but rather for the constitutionally protected freedom of expression of its associated foundation” and declare it intolerable. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal is demanding that the IRS hand over six years of Donald Trump’s tax returns , ostensibly to prove that the Internal Revenue Service is properly auditing Trump’s returns. Many of us suspect the real aim of demanding the returns is to overcome Trump’s refusal to disclose them and sniff through them, looking for embarrassing details. Pete Buttigieg challenges Vice President Pence, “If you have a problem with who I am, your problem is not with me. Your quarrel, sir, is with my creator.”(Never mind that it’s far from clear that Pence has a problem with who Buttigieg is.) The country has real problems: opioid addiction, economic anxiety and insecurity, a long-term debt and unstable entitlement programs, a rising suicide rate, ensuring that every child and young person gets an education that prepares them for a changing economy. But at this moment, the single most popular thing that political leaders of either party can do is “go after” figures and institutions associated with the other side. The biggest menace that Chick-fil-A presents to gay Americans is through the long-term threat of higher cholesterol, but Democratic lawmakers behave as if it must be driven from the nation’s airports. Think about the ideological blinders you must have on if you’re on the management board of a mid-sized airport, and you look upon the long lines, frustrated travelers, delayed flights, fraying infrastructure, spotty wireless, spotty signage, infrequent shuttles, and over in the corner, two businessmen desperate to recharge their phones and battling like gladiators over access to the last power outlet, and conclude that the Chick-fil-A sandwiches are the biggest problem that you need to address. The notion that the IRS is somehow negligent in its duties regarding Trump is implausible; even if we didn’t have the existing evidence of the partisan passions within that government agency, Trump would still be a big and juicy target for any ambitious tax investigator. It is reasonable to believe that if any of the methods Donald Trump used to minimize his tax bill over the past decades were provably and indisputably illegal, the IRS and prosecutors would be all over him. It is easy to believe that Trump and his accountants used every legal method to minimize his tax bill to the fullest extent and got into gray areas, but again, if at any point in the past decades the IRS thought it had a winnable case, why would it hesitate? In his autobiography Shortest Way Home , Buttigieg describes his relationship with Mike Pence as governor as “long and complicated” but the tension appears to lie almost entirely with Buttigieg. He describes cordial meetings with Pence as a congressman, “I was surprised with how affable, even gentle he was.” He writes that “the governor seemed determined to be a friend to South Bend. His office was always open to me, and he often appeared in our area for factory tours, ribbon cuttings, and other events, always with something good to say about our city.” He appoints Democrats to state boards. Pence declares at a local event, “South Bend is so blessed to have an energetic, innovative, forward-thinking, creative mayor in Pete Buttigieg.” Pence talks with Buttigieg about the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which some contended would legalize discrimination against gays, and the worst Buttigieg can say is “It was clear from the look in his eyes that he had made up his mind.” Back in 2015, Pence tweeted that if he saw a restaurant owner refuse to serve a gay couple, he wouldn’t eat there anymore. And when asked by a local television station what he thought of Buttigieg’s coming out, he replied, “I hold Mayor Buttigieg in the highest personal regard. We have a great working relationship. I see him as a dedicated public servant, and a patriot.” Buttigieg can never muster any examples of Pence being rude, hostile or hateful, but his book keeps lamenting “the complications of being openly gay in Mike Pence’s Indiana.” It’s as if Buttigieg knows his intended audience is expecting a tale of Pence sneering or denouncing the mayor, but the then-governor keeps failing to live down to expectations. As mentioned above, we’ve got bigger, more substantive problems to worry about on the national scene. Wage growth and automation; energy security and independence; the cost of higher education and whether it’s fostering genuine free thought, debate and inquiry; protecting our citizens at home and abroad from those who would seek to harm them. We just held a whole Ideas Summit tackling these big issues . But that’s not as much fun as “getting those guys!” — and it’s neither as widely covered by the national media, as quickly spread on social media, or as rewarded by the voters. Twitter Is Not Real Life, Part Infinity The New York Times’ s Nate Cohn and Kevin Quealy offer a cool graphic and article laying out how the vast majority of Democratic primary voters are not like the ones who are loudest and most active on social media. They’re more likely to identify as moderates or conservatives, more likely to say political correctness is a problem, don’t follow the news as closely, and be African-American. They add that polling might even “understate the leftward lean of the most politically active, Democratic Twitter users, who often engage with political journalists and can have a powerful effect in shaping the conventional wisdom.” Cohn asked the Democrats who follow him on Twitter how they classify themselves, and 29 percent said “very liberal” and 48 percent said “liberal.” The question is . . . how many political journalists realize this? How many political journalists keep that in mind when assessing who’s up and who’s down and what “the mood of the party’s grassroots” is? How Big Is the Gun Industry in Your State? The folks at WalletHub have put together an intriguing measurement of much a state is “dependent upon the gun industry,” although I think a more accurate moniker would be just measuring the gun culture in each state. They gathered the data on firearms-industry jobs per capita, gun sales per 1,000 residents, and gun-ownership rate. In the category of firearms industry jobs per capita, there was a three-way tie for first, among New Hampshire, Idaho, and Montana. But when you measure which states have the highest tax revenues from firearms industry per capita, Wyoming, Maine, and Alaska come out on top. The highest rates of gun ownership are in Alaska, Arkansas, and Idaho. The survey found a five-way tie for first in most NICS background checks per capita: Kentucky, Illinois, Indiana, West Virginia, and Idaho. I’ll be covering this year’s NRA Annual Meeting in Indianapolis, and each year I go, I marvel at just how many small American companies make up the gun industry. Besides the manufacturers, there are hundreds of companies that thrive from making associated gear, from holsters to gun safes to hunting equipment to cleaning materials to targets and skeet. Gun control activists talk about “the gun industry” and picture a bunch of guys in suits, which is not a particularly accurate portrait. ADDENDUM: Congratulations, University of Virginia Cavaliers! As somebody on sports radio said, they’ve just created the greatest “yes, but” in sports history. As in, for years to come, someone will chuckle, “Only one number-one seed has ever lost in the first round of the NCAA Tournament,” and someone else will inevitably respond, “Yes, but they came back and won the championship the following year!” To paraphrase the brilliant Remy , it’s such a relief to see “Virginia” trending on Twitter and know that for once, it’s not about a politician wearing blackface."
Vladimir Putin & Volodymyr Zelensky -- Would You Feel Comfortable with a Comedian Up against Putin? | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Jim Geraghty,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/would-you-feel-comfortable-putting-a-comedian-up-against-putin/,"April 9, 2019 2:14 PM
It’s a boom time for comedians leading political parties or running for office. Comments
The current Guatamalan president, Jimmy Morales, is a former comic actor. In Italy, Beppe Grillo founded the populist Five-Star Movement. And in Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky is a comedian who played a fictional president in a 2015 television series . . . and who just won the first round of that country’s presidential election with 5.2 million votes, almost twice the number of his nearest competitor, incumbent president Petro Poroshenko, who had just under 16 percent.
In today’s Wall Street Journal , French political playwright and public intellectual Bernard-Henri Lévy writes about a recent dinner conversation with Zelensky, and one portion is . . . not reassuring:
First, Vladimir Putin—his resolute opposition to Mr. Putin. “The guy has no look; he has eyes, but no look.” Mr. Zelensky wants badly to meet the Russian leader face to face. Why? “You realize that I can make even Putin laugh? A hollow laugh, but a laugh all the same. And all those Russian young people who know me very well will burst out laughing with me! What did you say about Coluche? The emperor has no clothes?”
It is good that Zelensky is resolutely opposed to Putin, but I hope he’s got a better plan than “make him laugh.” Yes, ridicule can be a powerful weapon against autocrats and dictators, but it’s rarely enough. There’s something unnerving about such a significant percentage of Ukrainian voters — who presumably would have their eyes wide open about the potential threat that Putin presents — and feeling comfortable entrusting their country’s highest office to a comedian."

The Trump administration on Tuesday ordered Texas Tech University to stop considering the race of applicants when making admissions decisions.
The order, which was handed down by the Department of Education’s Civil Rights Division, represents the culmination of a 14-year legal battle based on an agreement with the university that was reached in February, the Wall Street Journal first reported .
This is the first instance in which the administration has ordered a university to adjust its admissions criteria to reflect its interpretation of anti-discrimination law, which is narrower than the Obama administration’s was.
“This shows the Trump administration is taking seriously its responsibility to enforce civil rights in a way that protects all Americans,” Roger Clegg, general counsel of the Center for Equal Opportunity, an anti-affirmation-action advocacy group, told the Journal . “The more schools that don’t use racial preferences, the harder it is for the remaining schools to justify their use of it.” Stay Updated with NR Daily

While Texas Tech previously ended affirmative action in its pharmacy-school and undergraduate admissions processes, its medical school has continued to factor race into admissions, citing the importance of producing a racially diverse class of doctors who would be better-suited to serve different communities.
The Trump administration’s lawyers, however, argued that the school must study whether other factors, including socioeconomic background and language abilities, might better contribute to overall diversity.
“The Supreme Court has clarified that the academic judgment as to the educational benefits that exist from a diverse student body is entitled to some, but not complete, judicial deference,” Education Department officials wrote to Texas Tech in a March letter obtained by the Journal ."
Donor Privacy: States Need to Ensure It to Protect Freedom of Speech | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Jon Pritchett,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/states-need-to-ensure-donor-privacy-to-protect-freedom-of-speech/,"April 9, 2019 3:59 PM Mississippi governor Phil Bryant during an election night party in Jackson, Miss., November 27, 2018 (Jonathan Bachman/Reuters) Mississippi has joined Arizona in passing helpful legislation. The record of other states is not so good.
P rivate citizens should not be subjected to government harassment for supporting causes they believe in, and charities should not have to worry about their funding drying up because donors fear reprisals. Yet many policy pundits on the left, and even a few on the right, have been doing all they can to convince lawmakers across the country that the government has a compelling interest in knowing to whom you give your after-tax money. In using popular language such as “dark money” and “transparency,” the Left really means that it wants to know who funds its opposition, so it can bring pressure to bear and suppress its opponents’ speech with coercion and threats. Advertisement Advertisement
It’s no surprise that in blue states, including California, New York, Delaware, and New Mexico, the government is compelling 501(c) charities to disclose information about their donors. In recent years, some red states, too, including South Dakota, Utah, Alabama, and South Carolina, have also proposed legislation or regulation that would strip away donor privacy for charitable organizations, in the name of good government.
While transparency is what citizens require of their government, privacy is the constitutional right afforded to citizens. Conflating public requirements and private rights is clever but disingenuous. We should not allow proponents, from the Left or the Right, to get away with such sophistry. Advertisement
In the Federalist Papers , a collection of 85 essays promoting the adoption of the United States Constitution, written by Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay in 1787–88, the three founders used the pseudonym “Publius.” They did so because to advocate for something as radical and controversial as that revolutionary document was dangerous. Not everyone in power in 18th-century America agreed with these ideas.
The same was true of the supporters of the NAACP in the 1950s, when it was advocating for equal rights for every American. During those tumultuous times, many people of public influence and power were demanding to know the names of members or supporters of the NAACP. In NAACP v. Alabama (1958), Justice John Harlan II outlined the practical effects of compelling organizations to disclose their donor lists: It exposed them to “economic reprisals, loss of employment, threat of physical coercion, and other manifestations of physical hostilities.” Advertisement
Now imagine a person today who loses his job when his climate-zealot boss finds out that he gives money to a charity that opposes the Green New Deal. Or imagine the symphony director in a major city who is publicly shamed and harassed because he dared give to a charity that supports requiring people to use the public restroom that corresponds with their biological sex. Or how about an actual case in California, where the director of the Los Angeles Film Festival was forced to resign because he supported Proposition 8, the controversial rejection of same-sex marriage. California has been a proponent of forced disclosure of donor information for years, claiming that the information would be safe in the state’s hands. Yet Kamala Harris, the former California attorney general and now a U.S. senator and presidential hopeful, “inadvertently” allowed the names of donors to roughly 1,700 non-profits to be posted on a government website.

Nadine Strossen, a New York University law professor and former president of the American Civil Liberties Union, is a strong advocate of donor privacy. “Individuals should be able to join and support organizations without having their names and other private information disclosed,” she argues. “These rights remain essential today for the ongoing advocacy of civil-society groups across the ideological spectrum.” Advertisement"
Chick-fil-A Bans: Progressives Want to Silence Religious Believers | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,David French,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/the-renewed-chick-fil-a-controversy-shows-the-culture-war-will-only-get-worse/,"April 9, 2019 4:39 PM (Rashid Umar Abbasi/Reuters) Progressive corporations and governments are increasingly using power to attempt to expunge disfavored ideas from the public square.
E very single time I grow even slightly more optimistic about the state of American polarization and the prospects for true American tolerance, I get disappointed. Every time I think that we could perhaps see the light at the end of the tunnel of the culture wars, I’m reminded that it’s just another oncoming train. And at the risk of saturating readers with analysis of the renewed Chick-fil-A controversy, I think it’s worth describing why this latest revival of hatred for a chicken restaurant is an ominous harbinger of an even more divisive national cultural debate. Advertisement Advertisement
For those few readers who haven’t followed the latest twists in the chicken wars, after ThinkProgress reported that the Chick-fil-A Foundation donated to the Salvation Army, Fellowship of Christian Athletes, and a Christian home for troubled youth, the city council of San Antonio voted to block the restaurant from opening in the San Antonio airport. Shortly thereafter, the concessions vendor for the airport in Buffalo, N.Y., also moved to block Chick-fil-A.
I’ve written previously that any government efforts to block Chick-fil-A from opening are flagrantly unconstitutional , but I’m actually more concerned about three other aspects of the current controversy. Progressive intolerance is now directed at conventional Christian ministries (not just culture-war organizations), intolerance is driven by the progressive grassroots, and progressive corporations and governments are increasingly on an activist search-and-destroy mission against wrongthink. Advertisement
First, it’s worth reflecting on the sheer depth of the intolerance on display. Not one of the “offensive” organizations supported by Chick-fil-A could fairly be described as a culture-war organization. They’re standard Christian ministries that serve the poor and minister to young people. They have standard Christian rules of conduct. They are not remotely “anti-LGBT” but instead advance a different, biblical sexual ethic, one that applies to gay and straight individuals alike.
There is zero difference between giving to the Fellowship of Christian Athletes and giving to, say, a youth ministry at your local Baptist Church. Both organizations have similar conduct rules. Both organizations have similar sexual ethics. Both organizations reach young people in similar ways. Is it now contrary to the values of an American city to award contracts to companies owned by tithing Christians? As the recent controversy surrounding Karen Pence’s decision to teach at a church school demonstrated, now even engagement with conventional church ministries is problematic. That’s the level of anti-religious animus we’re dealing with. Advertisement
Second, the sad reality is that comprehensive anti-religious discrimination is no longer a top-down imposition by a small, secular elite, but rather a grassroots demand from a large segment of the Democratic base. If you look at religious-freedom controversies across the country, rarely will you see any involvement by the federal government. I spent 20 years defending religious liberty in federal courts and only sued the feds once, when they came after Tea Party groups during the Obama administration. Advertisement
If you spend any time in an American university, a major American corporation, or the governments of America’s deep-blue urban regions, you’ll find pervasive animus against religiously orthodox Christians. Christians working in those spaces write to me all the time, telling me that they must tightly regulate their speech and tightly control their social media, lest they endanger their careers. That is especially true if they raise any religious objections to any aspect of the sexual revolution — from abortion to gay marriage to debates over gender identity.
And this brings us to the third negative trend. It would be bad enough if this pervasive intolerance were confined to the workspace, but progressive corporations and governments are increasingly using power to attempt to expunge disfavored ideas from the public square. In a recent episode of my friend and colleague Jonah Goldberg’s excellent “Remnant” podcast, we discussed the institutional drive on the Left towards “performative wokeness.” We essentially defined it as the drive for institutions to aggressively depart from their core, underlying missions for the sake of aggressively advancing social justice.

Apple, for example, is in the tech business, but it also is defining part of its mission in unrelated moral terms — using its immense financial, cultural, and political power to take specific stands against greater legal protections for religious liberty , to take one example. Citibank and Bank of America are using their financial power to advance gun control ."
Shaun King’s False Accusations | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Michelle Malkin,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/shaun-king-activist-accusations/,"April 10, 2019 6:30 AM Shaun King (via Twitter) The activist accuses the innocent to stoke racial fears and shrugs off the results
T his week, “journalist, activist and humanitarian” Shaun King will give a keynote speech at the annual Innocence Network conference in Atlanta, Ga. The theme of the event, whose attendees work to prevent and undo wrongful convictions, is “The Presumption of Innocence.”
I’ve covered many flabbergasting things over the course of 25 years as a columnist, author, blogger and documentary host, but this one takes the cake. Advertisement Advertisement
It was just three months ago that King recklessly exploited the shooting death of 7-year-old Jazmine Barnes in Houston, Texas, to stoke racial fear and hatred. The little girl and her family, who are black, got caught in crossfire at a Walmart parking lot. The Black Lives Matter activist and columnist for the Intercept immediately pounced — using his huge Twitter platform, followed by 1.1 million people, to cast the incident as a racial hate crime. King splashed a photo of Robert Cantrell, a white man who had been arrested for robbery the same day as the Barnes shooting, all over social media.
“We’ve had 20 people call or email us and say he is a racist, violent a****le and always has been. Just tell me everything you know,” social-justice detective King incited on Twitter. Cantrell’s family members faced vitriol and death threats online as a result of the irresponsible gossip-mongering. After two black men were arrested for the murder, King sputtered to save his reputation — first by claiming credit for passing on a tip that led to the arrests (which he kept quiet about while stoking anti-white hatred), and then by doubling down with a fake-but-accurate defense.
“We live in a time where somebody could do something like this based purely on hate or race,” he smugly argued. “And that it turned out to not be the case I don’t think changes the devastating conclusion that people had thought something like that was possible.” Advertisement Advertisement
There’s nothing “humanitarian” or exemplary about such an attitude. This is race-hustling cynicism at its worst. It’s par for the twisted course for King, who is a serial apologist for treating people as guilty until proven innocent and for threatening those who call him out (including critics within the progressive Left who have alleged he has ripped off the movement).
In May 2018, the Lying King led the witch hunt against innocent white Texas state trooper Daniel Hubbard by spreading the false claims of a black woman who lied about Hubbard raping her during a traffic stop. That admitted liar, Sherita Dixon-Cole, escaped prosecution based on a technicality. King’s reward? Moving up from the New York Daily News to a coveted position at the Harvard-affiliated Fair Punishment Project, which in part conducts research to prevent more wrongful convictions.
In 2014, King promoted the anti-cop “hands up, don’t shoot” lie debunked by none other than the Obama Justice Department, yet he still doesn’t care about the truth. “I’m not going to parse evidence or make some complex technical argument that Michael Brown did or didn’t have his hands up,” he defiantly retorted. “To me, it doesn’t matter if he did or he didn’t. It never has.” Advertisement
As former New York City police detective Sergeant John Paolucci, who is on the board of Uncuff the Innocent, which advocates for wrongfully convicted police officers, told me: “When the agenda is to instill in people a fear of the police, one creates an environment conducive to more deadly confrontations. . . . Having worked the most high-profile police involved cases in the media, I’m well aware that the whole truth is never reported in these investigations and the probative value of evidence that favors the police is diminished or omitted entirely when it hits the news.” Advertisement
In 2015, King gloried in the wrongful rape convictions of former Oklahoma City police officer Daniel Holtzclaw, whose flawed case and forensic errors led six internationally renowned scientists to call for a retrial. He has failed to follow up because, of course, the truth doesn’t fit his narrative. Advertisement
The “journalist” also maintained the same obstinate stance after his disgraceful sliming of football star Peyton Manning in 2016, when he attempted to ride the #MeToo publicity wave by recycling — and woefully misinterpreting — a 13-year-old court filing regarding a settlement with a female trainer who had claimed she was sexually harassed, and then changed her story seven years later. Instead of admitting error, he played victim.
It’s disturbing enough that King is being honored at the Innocence Conference, where many lawyers, activists, scientists and exonerees I admire will attend. Even worse, King heads up a publication called The North Star , which purports to “speak truth to power” and is aimed at young people of color.
Wrongfully convicted Marine Tim Wright and his wife, Danielle, wonder: “How can an individual with a reputation of making countless false accusations against white men, racially profiling whites and stirring up racial discourse in America be trusted with the hearts and minds of future generations of minority children?” Advertisement"
Facebook Advocates Governments Regulate Online Speech | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Brendan Carr,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/facebook-advocates-government-regulation-online-speech/,"April 10, 2019 6:30 AM Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg testifies on Capitol Hill in April 2018. (Leah Millis/Reuters) Its founder wants the government to regulate and police online speech.
F acebook is under mounting scrutiny for its approach to moderating online speech. Lawmakers and the public alike have serious questions about the decisions Facebook chooses to make about the things you can say and the posts you can see on its platform. Some of those questions will likely be asked this week by the Senate Judiciary Committee when it holds a hearing on technology companies and free speech. Advertisement Advertisement
So with this increased focus on Facebook’s decisions, the social-media giant is taking a new approach. Last week, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg called for the government to police your speech instead of having Facebook do it. He wants governments around the world to adopt rules that would determine what types of speech are and are not allowed online. Unfortunately for his plan, government censorship isn’t just a bad idea; in America, at least, it would violate the First Amendment.
Now, Facebook may see this as a convenient way of passing the buck. Or perhaps it wants to divert attention from calls to break up Big Tech. But none of that justifies Facebook’s decision to surrender our First Amendment rights as tribute.
In my experience as a commissioner at the Federal Communications Commission, large corporations do not call for greater government control as an act of charity. They do it to solidify their positions in the market and insulate themselves from competition. Facebook already employs 30,000 people to perform “content and security review,” and they have an army of lawyers and lobbyists ready to navigate costly new regulations. Startups and would-be competitors do not have those resources. So the rules Facebook wants would operate as an economic moat, insulating it from upstart players. It’s no surprise, then, that Facebook waited until after it established a leading position and a market capitalization of half a trillion dollars before finding religion in regulation. Advertisement
This marriage of Big Tech and Big Brother would represent a sweeping new intrusion on our First Amendment rights. The online speech czar that Facebook proposes wouldn’t just target illegal content. Instead, Facebook would have the government police what it calls “harmful content”—a broad category of speech that is fully protected by the First Amendment. What is harmful content? Would a robust defense of Second Amendment rights cross the line? Facebook wants politicians to decide. And there’s certainly no shortage of regimes around the world that would welcome the chance to shut down political speech or free expression on the grounds that it represents “harmful content.” Quite simply, Facebook’s plan is an invitation for governments worldwide to silence unpopular ideas. Advertisement
After the op-ed ran, one Facebook official tried to walk back the proposal, saying that Zuckerberg only meant for foreign governments to regulate online speech. In the U.S., the official said, Facebook would set up an internal oversight board that would have binding authority to make decisions about speech that is and is not allowed. This is cold comfort when it comes to online freedom. It shows that Facebook is perfectly willing to join arm and arm with foreign governments to censor online speech, since that pesky First Amendment applies only in the U.S. But we should not geo-fence our commitment to free expression, and we should not bargain it away as a cost of doing business overseas. Advertisement
In any event, Zuckerberg largely rejected the walk-back in an interview later in the week with ABC’s George Stephanopoulos. In it, Zuckerberg issued a new and expanded call for the U.S. government itself to police online speech. It is time for our government to step in, Zuckerberg said, and regulate speech on “divisive political issues.” He cited as an example such hot-button issues as immigration. But that’s not the government’s role. In fact, there’s little more deeply rooted in the fabric of our country than the robust and free exchange of views on controversial issues. We should all want it to remain free from government regulation."
Attorney General Barr Says Mueller Report to Be Released within Week | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Andrew C. Mccarthy,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/attorney-general-barr-mueller-report-release/,"April 10, 2019 6:30 AM Attorney General William Barr testifies on Capitol Hill, April 9, 2019. (Aaron P. Bernstein/Reuters) Don’t expect any major revelations, but do expect redactions.
I t is a credit to Attorney General Bill Barr that his testimony yesterday morning before a House Appropriations subcommittee seemed, for the most part, like a nonevent.
Ostensibly, the subject of the hearing was the Justice Department’s $29.2 billion budget request for fiscal year 2020. But because the hearing was the AG’s first appearance on Capitol Hill since his March 24 letter outlining the conclusions of the Mueller report, that topic — specifically, the frenzied anticipation of Barr’s release of a redacted version of the special counsel’s report (said to be 300 to 400 pages in length) — took center stage. Advertisement Advertisement
Democrats were loaded for bear, but Barr warded off their jabs, explaining the process by which the report is being reviewed and making some news along the way.
Here are the major takeaways.
The attorney general will release the Mueller report to Congress and the public within the next week. (Note that Congress is scheduled to take its two-week spring break starting Friday). Advertisement
The internal Justice Department review and redaction of the report continues to be a collaboration between the attorney general and the special counsel, and that process has gone smoothly.
When the report is released, the redactions will be color-coded so that readers will know the rationale for each excision: grand-jury material, classified information, ongoing investigation, or Justice Department privacy policy (apparently to be invoked on behalf of peripheral figures, not the main players). These categories of redaction were addressed in the attorney general’s March 29 letter . Advertisement
Barr will engage with congressional leaders on the redactions to determine whether there may and should be additional disclosure.
Once again, the attorney general explained that his March 24 letter was merely a synopsis of the special counsel’s bottom-line conclusions (along with an explanation of his own conclusion on the obstruction issue, on which Mueller opted not to make a prosecutorial judgment). Barr did not undertake to “summarize” the Mueller report, and assertions that he provided a misleading summary are unfounded. There will not be a summary of the report; there will be the report — excised as described above.
Special Counsel Mueller was given an opportunity to review the attorney general’s letter outlining the report’s conclusions but declined to do that. (I suspect that is because the report made those conclusions quite clear — and, on the matter of obstruction, made it clear that the special counsel presented evidence on both sides of the question but did not draw a conclusion. Mueller, who has known Barr for decades, had no reason to doubt that the conclusions would be accurately rendered.) Advertisement Advertisement
The Justice Department does not intend to seek a court order permitting disclosure of grand-jury material. As I pointed out in a column last Friday, in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, the Justice Department took the position that judges have no authority to disclose outside of the exceptions to grand-jury secrecy laid out in Rule 6(e) (Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure). Last Friday, in McKeever v. Barr , the court agreed with the Justice Department. The Rule 6(e) exceptions do not provide for disclosure to Congress. It would thus make no sense to seek a disclosure order.
The attorney general added that if House Judiciary Committee chairman Jerrold Nadler (D., N.Y.) wants to argue that there is a legal basis for disclosure outside of Rule 6(e), he will hear the chairman out. (As I’ve pointed out, Congress enacted Rule 6(e) and could enact legislation amending it to permit disclosure of grand-jury material to Congress in special-counsel investigations.) Advertisement
Barr said that Justice Department inspector general Michael Horowitz’s inquiry into aspects of the Trump-Russia investigation (including alleged FISA abuse) will be released by June, and perhaps as early as May.
Importantly, the attorney general also stated that he is looking into the conduct of the Justice Department and the FBI’s Trump-Russia investigation, including what triggered the probe’s initiation."
Women’s Suffrage: Women’s National Republican Club Tells the Story | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Marlo Safi,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/womens-suffrage-movement-republican-history-exhibit/,"April 10, 2019 6:30 AM Women’s National Republican Club founder Henrietta Wells Livermore (Bain News Service/Library of Congress) An exhibit at the Women’s National Republican Club in New York tells the story. A century ago next year, after several decades of resilient activism, women finally earned the right to vote. And in New York State, the final push for suffrage was launched in 1910 by one-woman juggernaut Henrietta Wells Livermore, who also founded the Women’s National Republican Club in 1921. This year, to commemorate the historic achievement, the club is featuring an exhibit titled “Women’s Suffrage and the Founding of The Women’s National Republican Club” in its Manhattan headquarters. The exhibit highlights the suffrage movement, the club’s role in educating women about politics and their newly gained right, and relics from the era, including a letter from President Calvin Coolidge. On February 14, 1910, twelve women met at Livermore’s home to revitalize the suffrage movement in New York State, and suffrage for New York’s women was passed in a statewide referendum in November 1917. To inform women of their newly gained right and the subjects they’d be voting on, she founded the Women’s National Republican Club in New York City in 1921. Today, it’s the oldest national club for Republican women in the country. The clubhouse itself is the third home of the club, built to accommodate its growing membership, and is located in the heart of Manhattan at the site of Andrew Carnegie’s former home at 3 West 51st Street. The building’s interior is distinguished and regal, and it hosts gala dinners, awards ceremonies, and other events for its members. One of its committees is the Henrietta Wells Livermore School of Politics, which continues to organize volunteers for political campaigns and sponsors political-education seminars and lectures. “Livermore decided that women needed to be educated so they could vote,” Judy McGrath, the exhibit curator, tells me as she guides me through it. “She was disappointed that there was very low female turnout in the first election that women could vote in, so she wanted to create a place where women could meet other women and become educated on the matters they’d be voting on.” The exhibit details the club’s history and the lives of its founders, who also include Pauline Sabin and Ruth Baker Pratt. Ruth Baker Pratt was the first female representative to be elected from New York (in 1928), and she said on Election Night that she “did not run as a woman but as a citizen.” Pauline Sabin was the first woman representative to the Republican National Committee and served as a delegate to two Republican National Conventions. She also played a significant role in the repeal of Prohibition. The exhibit also includes many relics, including a letter from GOP president Calvin Coolidge to the club commemorating its opening in 1924 and a 1902 letter from Susan B. Anthony. Coolidge was an ardent supporter of suffrage at a time when it was unpopular. Usually a walker of the party line, he went against his party’s orthodoxy, noting that women uniquely look to the future and “think of conditions not only for themselves but for their posterity.” Eventually, the Republican party became the first major party to advocate equal rights for women, and it wasn’t until the Republicans gained control of Congress in 1919 — after Democrats had defeated the 19th amendment four times — that the amendment passed. Twenty-six of the 36 states that ratified it had Republican legislatures. Maritza Bolano, a chairwoman on the Suffragette Committee and the editor of a forthcoming book detailing the suffrage movement and the founding of the club, emphasizes the importance of the Republican party’s role in suffrage. “The Republican party was the leader in women’s rights, as it had been the leader in abolition from Lincoln. The party leaders welcomed women and wanted women to participate.” The exhibit is open to club members and their guests, and Bolano tells me groups are encouraged to contact the club and arrange to view it. “It’s important that young people, especially, learn from this exhibit.”"
Does Beto O'Rourke Have the Right to Be Called 'Beto'? | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Jay Nordlinger,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/names-politics-beto-orourke/,"April 10, 2019 6:30 AM Beto O’Rourke speaks with supporters in Dubuque, Iowa, March 16, 2019. (Ben Brewer/Reuters) On ‘Beto,’ ‘Jimmy,’ ‘Pete,’ ‘Mitt,’ etc.
Editor’s Note : This piece is an expansion of an essay published in the current issue of National Review .
B eto O’Rourke, the ex-congressman from El Paso, has decided to run for president. He is being teased for jumping on counters, to talk to voters in diners. He is also being teased about his name: “Beto.” What’s he trying to get away with? He’s no Hispanic. He’s Robert Francis O’Rourke. Advertisement Advertisement
He is indeed. But from infancy, he has been called “Beto.” This is a Spanish nickname for “Roberto” (and for “Alberto” and for other names that end in “berto”). El Paso, home of the O’Rourkes (!), is a strongly Hispanic community.
Incidentally, El Paso is where Susana Martinez grew up. I’m talking about the Republican who was governor from 2011 to 2019 in neighboring New Mexico.
Moreover, Baby Beto had a grandfather named “Robert,” and the baby’s parents wanted to distinguish their new addition from him. So … Advertisement
Flash forward to college. Beto O’Rourke enrolled at Columbia in New York, and he tried going by “Robert” for a while. “I didn’t want to explain what ‘Beto’ is and how to pronounce it,” he told an interviewer last year. “I wanted to fit in, and ‘Beto’ doesn’t fit in. … There’s also a disconnect, right? There’s this tall white guy, and he’s ‘Beto.’”
Even so, the young man thought of himself as “Beto,” not “Robert,” and “Robert” soon went. Advertisement
Flash forward to last month, on St. Patrick’s Day. The Republican National Committee issued a tweet, showing O’Rourke’s mug shot. (He was arrested for drunk driving in 1998.) They put a leprechaun-style hat on his head and said, “On this St. Paddy’s Day, a special message from noted Irishman Robert Francis O’Rourke.” That message was “PLEASE DRINK RESPONSIBLY.”
P ersonally, I think people have a right to the name of their choice, pronounced the way they prefer. We could think of exceptions to this rule, as to most rules. But I think it is a rule. Advertisement
By the way, Beto O’Rourke pronounces his name “Bet-o” rather than “Bait-o.” It rhymes with “falsetto” rather than “Plato.”
Got time for a quick George Bush story? Good. I’m talking Bush 41. A speechwriter placed a quotation by Demosthenes — it might have been Thucydides — in some speech. Not wanting to stumble over pronunciation, the president said, simply, “Plato.” Probably no one was the wiser.
Back to the pronunciation of “Beto.” From the mouths of most Spanish-speakers, the name is pronounced somewhere between “Bet-o” and “Bait-o,” but closer to the former. This is hard for us Anglos to pull off. I have a memory, from long ago: Rita Moreno, the Broadway star, was trying to get Americans to say her name correctly. They said “Moraino,” to rhyme with “Drano” (the de-clogging product). She wanted her name to rhyme with “steno,” as in “pool.” Advertisement
Let’s move on …
In his language column, back in 1983, William Safire took up the question of names and their pronunciations. He wrote, “Your house may not be your castle, but your moniker is your property to pronounce the way you like and to correct others about.” He mentioned the case of Tony Dorsett, the football star.
When Dorsett was in college, we all said “DOR-sit.” When he got to the pros, he announced that he wanted his name pronounced “Dor-SETT.” I can tell you that I found it hard to adjust — but that’s what the guy wanted. (In truth, a lot of people called him “TD,” plain and simple. Those were his initials, and, more important, they stood for “touchdown.”)
Leonard Bernstein, the musician, said “Bernstine,” not “Bernsteen.” “You don’t say ‘Gertrude Steen,’” he explained. “And you don’t say ‘Albert Einsteen.’” There are Bernsteens in the world — plenty of them — but the musician preferred “Bernstine.” Advertisement
Okay — but I once worked with a man who insisted on calling him “Bernsteen.” It was a point of pride with him, somehow. He was stubborn about it. I think he thought Bernstein was trying to get away with something, or put on airs. And he wasn’t gonna let him …
R eturn, now, to Texas. Last year, Beto O’Rourke ran for the U.S. Senate, losing to the incumbent, Ted Cruz. Ted’s full name is “Rafael Edward Cruz.” (His father came from Cuba as a refugee.) Ted grew up as “Felito” — but in junior high, he wanted out of that name. How come? He explained in his autobiography, published in 2015.
(Perhaps I should pause to explain why I am calling him “Ted,” rather than “Cruz” or “the senator” — he and I are old friends. It feels natural.) Advertisement
The problem with “Felito,” Ted writes, “was that it seemed to rhyme with every major corn chip on the market — Fritos, Cheetos, Doritos, Tostitos — a fact that other young children were quite happy to point out.” He continues, “I was tired of being teased. One day I had a conversation with my mother about it and she said, ‘You know, you could change your name. There are a number of other possibilities.’” Advertisement
This hit the young man like a thunderbolt. “It was a shocking concept,” Ted writes. “It had never occurred to me that I had any input on my name.” He decided on “Ted,” derived from his middle name, Edward.
Self-reinvention is as American as apple pie. Think of Jay Gatsby, a.k.a. the Great Gatsby, who started out in North Dakota as “Jimmy Gatz.” “Gatz,” huh? Possibly Jewish? This has been a theory, or suggestion, among literary critics.
There was a time when many American Jews felt they had to Anglicize, or de-Judaize, their names. I think merely of opera singers — a slew of them. Rubin Ticker became Richard Tucker. Jacob Pincus Perelmuth — Tucker’s brother-in-law, as it happened — became Jan Peerce. Before he was that , he sang as “Jack Pearl” and “Pinky Pearl.” Moishe Miller became Robert Merrill. Previously, he was Morris Miller, and then Merrill Miller. (Finally, Robert Merrill.) Advertisement
Can you guess Belle Silverman? She became Beverly Sills. And this one is easy: Roberta Peters, previously, was Roberta Peterman.
We could dwell on a few Italians too. Dean Martin, from Steubenville, Ohio, started out as Dino Crocetti. Before he became “Dean Martin,” he sang as “Dino Martini,” borrowing from Nino Martini, a tenor (like Tucker and Peerce).
Do you know the tenor Charles Anthony? He was born Charles Anthony Caruso, in 1929. That last name was kind of taken, tenor-wise. He dropped it, and kept the other two.
Back to Jews for a moment, please. I was once at an event with Mike Wallace, the TV journalist, who was originally “Myron,” not “Mike.” He recounted a story from his boyhood: “Mr. Maddy said to me, ‘Now, Myron …’ — because that’s my name, ‘Myron.’” He pointed to himself as he said this. I was rather touched by the tense — the present tense.
Jimmy Van Heusen, the songwriter, started out as Chester Babcock. He wanted what he regarded as a more stylish name — and wound up adopting “Van Heusen.” He noticed the name while looking through a magazine, which had an ad for men’s shirts.
Years later, the name “Chester Babcock” found its way into one of Bob Hope’s Road movies, The Road to Hong Kong (1962). That was the name of Hope’s character. All his life, Van Heusen’s nearest, dearest friends called him “Chet.”
Names are such a personal thing. So very personal.
I was talking about politics before. Let’s get back to it. In 1976, an ex-governor of Georgia ran for president as “Jimmy.” (One of the names that Chet Babcock ultimately chose!) Surely he couldn’t be president as Jimmy, a lot of people thought. “Jimmy” might have been all right for Georgia. But a Jimmy on the world stage, talking with Brezhnev and the rest?
In November, he won, beating President Ford. In the months before the inauguration, the question was, How will he be sworn in? As “James Earl Carter Jr.”? Or as “Jimmy”?
He stuck to “Jimmy,” simply because he wanted to, and because he could.
In 1984, Gary Hart ran for the Democratic nomination. Once upon a time, he had been “Hartpence.” Some Republicans liked to refer to him, hootingly, as “Hartpence.” What was he trying to get away with? Moreover, he had changed his signature, several times! Obviously, he was a flake trying to work out an identity.
I bet a lot of people have tried out more than one signature, before settling on one.
In 1988, William F. Buckley Jr. hosted the first debate of the Republican-primary season. One candidate, Pete du Pont, was jabbing another candidate, Vice President Bush, for a lack of specifics on arms control. “We’re waiting for details,” he said, “and we’re hearing generalities.” Bush replied — not very nicely — “Pierre, let me help you.”
Ooooh . True, du Pont is Pierre S. du Pont IV. But he has always been known as “Pete.” They alternate in their family, as the candidate explained after the debate. No. 3 was called “Pierre.” No. 4 is “Pete.” No. 5 is “Pierre.” That’s the way it goes. Advertisement
Regardless, Bush had succeeded in framing his opponent as a fancypants aristocrat, and French , to boot. David Broder, “the dean of the Washington press corps,” as he was known, wrote that “the night belonged to Bush — the man who dared to call a Pierre a Pierre.”
Bush himself was no plebe, of course: He was George Herbert Walker Bush. While we’re talking of names, I love something that Bush said after his eldest son was sworn in as president in 2001: “I used to be ‘George Bush.’ I used to be ‘the president.’ I don’t know who the hell I am anymore.”
The Bushes’ second-oldest son is Jeb — whose name comes from his initials, his formal name being John Ellis Bush.
During the Obama years, some Republicans liked to knock the president as “Barry.” One day, I saw a headline with the name “Barry” in it. I thought it referred to the notorious D.C. politician, Marion S. Barry (with the “S” standing for “Shepilov,” an interesting story in itself). Nope, the headline referred to Obama — who, for a time in his early life, which was a complicated life, went by the first name “Barry.”
Some people have complicated lives. Including presidents. Gerald R. Ford was born Leslie Lynch King Jr. Bill Clinton grew up as Billy Blythe. Very complicated, very messy.
In 2008, Mitt Romney ran for the GOP presidential nomination, unsuccessfully, and he tried for it again in ’12, this time succeeding. A lot of people didn’t like Romney — lefties and righties alike. A few of my colleagues insisted on calling him “Willard”: “because that’s his name,” one of them said: “ Willard .” Occasionally, they threw in “Mittens,” just for extra mockery, I suppose.
Yes, the guy’s name is Willard Mitt Romney. The “Willard” comes from J. Willard Marriott, the hotel entrepreneur, who was a friend of Romney’s father. The “Mitt” comes from a relative, Milton Romney, a quarterback for the Chicago Bears in the 1920s — whose nickname was “Mitt.” Before kindergarten, the future politician was known as “Billy.” In kindergarten, he decided he wanted to be called “Mitt.”
You can knock him all you want, as far as I’m concerned — it’s a free country. But what does calling him “Willard” or “Mittens” accomplish?
A bram became Abraham; Jacob became Israel; Saul became Paul. All of this is terribly significant. Leaving the Bible, shall we go to sports?
Cassius Clay became Muhammad Ali — owing to a religious conversion. Before that, he was simply “Cassius X.” That letter stood for the name you could not possibly know, because it had come from Africa, in slave days, and had been erased.
Malcolm Little came to despise his name — a name he felt did not really belong to him but had been thrust on him and his family. He chose his own name, “Malcolm X.” I can understand this — anyone could. (Some people said “Malcolm the Tenth,” some of them innocently, some of them mischievously.)
Lew Alcindor became Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Many Americans continued to say “Alcindor,” as they had “Clay” — out of habit, defiance, or contempt. A name change can be a disorienting experience, both for the individual concerned and for the world around him.
Stick with basketball? Lloyd B. Free became World B. Free. (Explanation: Back in the neighborhood — Brooklyn — he had been known as “All-World,” later shortened to “World.”) Ron Artest became Metta World Peace. (“World Peace” is the last name; “Metta” is the first name, borrowed from Buddhism.)
To say it again, names are a very personal, very sensitive thing. In Detroit, we had a pitcher on the Tigers, Willie Hernandez, who came from Puerto Rico. At some point, he rebelled against the Anglo-American moniker that had been put on him: “Willie.” He let everyone know that he wanted to be called “Guillermo,” his name.

Opioid Crisis: Suing Pharmaceutical Companies Not the Answer | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Charles Fain Lehman,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/opioid-crisis-pharmaceutical-company-lawsuits/,"April 10, 2019 6:30 AM A pharmacist holds 40mg pills of OxyContin, made by Purdue Pharma. (George Frey/Reuters) It’s important to do justice to bad actors — but don’t expect a reduction in overdoses.
T here are good odds that Purdue Pharma, makers of the addictive prescription opioid OxyContin and perennial villain of the opioid crisis, will soon declare bankruptcy . The firm just reached a settlement with Oklahoma, paying out $270 million for what the state sees as the company’s role in the drug-overdose deaths of thousands of citizens. Several states are now going after Purdue’s owners, the ultra-wealthy Sackler family, as well. Blood, as one legal expert put it to the New York Times , is in the water. Advertisement Advertisement
With these lawsuits dominating the headlines, it is easy to assume that penalizing big pharmaceutical firms like Purdue will actually fix America’s overdose crisis, which killed more than 70,000 people in 2017 alone: Big Pharma is the bad guy, and taking it down should therefore solve our problems. If, as historian Cynthia Wachtel recently wrote in the Washington Post , “unfettered greed created an opioid epidemic,” then it is easy to conclude that punishing the greedy will allow us to, in Wachtel’s words, “conquer the epidemic.”
A great deal of ink is therefore spilled excoriating pharmaceutical firms. One recent Baltimore Sun op-ed called Purdue “the shame of the opioid crisis.” An article posted earlier this year at The Nation explicitly pinned the current crisis on pharmaceutical misdeeds, and argued that while “the current opioid crisis transcends Purdue,” this in large part because “there are numerous, widely prescribed opioid medications out there besides Oxy.” Advertisement
To be sure, firms and individuals are likely guilty of unethical , destructive business practices in the name of profit, leading directly to many deaths in the mid-to-late 2000s. Suing them (or even prosecuting them criminally) could deter similar conduct in future, ensure justice for those whose lives have been wrecked by irresponsibly issued opioids, and remunerate the states and communities that have had to clean up the pharmaceutical companies’ mess.
But popular reporting can give the impression that pharmaceutical firms are currently, rather than previously, the main source of the crisis. This is simply not the case. We are no longer in a prescription-opioid crisis, but rather in a polydrug crisis driven primarily by illegal fentanyl. The major killers of Americans today are not pharmaceutical firms, but foreign drug-trafficking organizations. Advertisement
Failing to pay sufficient attention to this reality can only hurt efforts to stop the crisis. Further, too much attention paid to prescription pills encourages undue regulatory and social pressure on pain patients, which may exacerbate, rather than alleviate, the overdose crisis and other major social ills. Advertisement
Although the latest wave of lawsuits against big pharma is only getting started, drug-enforcement and public-health officials have been responding to the rise in prescription-drug deaths for years. During his second term in office, President Barack Obama turned federal attention to reducing prescription-drug supply through a number of tactics, including rescheduling some opioids, enhanced enforcement , and expanding Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs. The results: After rising to 81.3 opioid prescriptions per 100 Americans in 2012, the number fell to 58.3 per hundred in five years. It should drop another third by 2021.
This reduction has had measurable effects on the abuse of, and overdose deaths from, prescription painkillers. According to federal survey data, the number of Americans who self-reported current misuse of pain relievers has fallen from 4.9 million in 2012 to 3.2 million in 2017 — a nearly 40 percent reduction when adjusting for population. What is more, many of these users are taking pills prescribed to someone else . Advertisement
The total number of deaths involving prescription opioids did continue to creep up after 2012, but the most recent data suggest they’re finally receding. Further, many recent prescription deaths involve fentanyl as well — and when you subtract fentanyl-involved ODs, the overdose rate from prescription opioids has actually dropped slightly since 2012. Advertisement
All in all, we have gone through a three-phase crisis , with the overall number of opioid deaths rising through all three phases: Prescription-opioid deaths began rising in the 1990s but were eventually supplanted by heroin overdoses, which in turn have been supplanted by deaths involving fentanyl and its analogues. In 2017 , fentanyl was involved in 28,000 deaths, compared to just over 15,000 deaths involving heroin and just under 15,000 involving prescription pills (many deaths involve both or all three).
Unsurprisingly, illegal heroin and fentanyl are not being made by American pharmaceutical firms. They are produced primarily in China or Mexico , then smuggled across the porous southwestern border or sent in by mail . Deaths are also now rising in some non-opioid drug categories, including methamphetamine , cocaine, and benzodiazepines — most of which are similarly foreign imports . Advertisement
Failing to take all of these other problems into account constitutes a major oversight in any story about the drug crisis. What is more, overzealous focus on big pharma and prescription opioids can hurt those it is meant to help, by making life hard not only for pharmaceutical firms, but for chronic pain patients and the doctors who care for them. Advertisement
A recent survey of medical professionals who prescribe opioids, for example, found that 52 percent felt “villainized” by media coverage of the crisis. Forty percent of them said that coverage had caused them to prescribe opioids less frequently than before.
To be sure, reducing needlessly long prescriptions is a good way to reduce the supply of drugs that that can be diverted to illegal use. But 20 percent of Americans suffer from chronic pain, including 8 percent with “high-impact” chronic pain. For many of these patients, opioids still serve as the only available relief, the absence of which can even lead to suicide attempts .
“Conflating the misuse of opioids with their legitimate medical use, and treating all opioids — illegal or prescription — alike is stigmatizing patients for whom opioid painkillers are necessary and medically appropriate,” wrote two medical professionals and a chronic-pain advocate in a STAT news op-ed . Advertisement
And even in regards to opioid abuse there are trade-offs inherent in reducing supply. There is good evidence that the aforementioned efforts to stop prescription-pill abuse led many users to pick up heroin instead, thereby failing to mitigate harm. In a 2018 paper published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, three economists show that the “tamper-proof” reformulation of OxyContin — making it harder to crush up and snort — triggered a mass switch to heroin use. “The reformulation did not generate a reduction in combined heroin and opioid mortality — each prevented opioid death was replaced with a heroin death,” the authors write."
Donald Trump’s Critics Are Incompetent | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Kevin D. Williamson,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/donald-trump-critics-incompetent/,"About Kevin D. Williamson April 10, 2019 6:30 AM President Trump arrives to speak at the National Republican Congressional Committee Annual Spring Dinner in Washington, D.C., April 2, 2019. (Joshua Roberts/Reuters) Democrats overlook the president’s obvious shortcomings in their determination to tell a more exotic story.
A strange thing about President Donald Trump’s critics: The ones who are best positioned to make a case against him and who have the strongest incentive to do so — the Democrats — have proved the least competent at doing so.
The legitimate criticisms of President Trump are mostly the ones that were obvious to critics such as myself in 2016: He does not really know how to do the job and so has trouble with basic things like staffing his administration and moving his legislative priorities through Congress; he is mercurial and inconstant; he lies, even when there isn’t any reason to, seemingly out of habit; he is vain and emotionally incontinent, which distorts his decision-making; he has surrounded himself with some very shady and untrustworthy people; he has some pretty loopy ideas about trade and about America’s role in the world. Trump says, not without reason, that he is a different kind of politician, but in reality he has been at his best when he has deferred to such pillars of the establishment as the Federalist Society and Senator Mitch McConnell. Advertisement
Maybe that’s not sexy enough for some tastes, but it is the truth.
The Democrats are determined to tell a more exotic story — or stories. Advertisement
Some of these are very silly — for example, the claim that Trump’s ownership of business interests abroad puts him in violation of the Constitution’s emoluments clause, which has nothing to do with the ownership of hotels or golf courses. The hotly anticipated Mueller report has so far been more fizzle than sizzle. The Trump–Russia conspiracy theories grow ever more baroque and unlikely. Louise Mensch, quondam Guardian contributor and chronicler of the behind-the-scenes doings of the “marshal of the Supreme Court,” reports (and let’s go ahead and make the asterisk there explicit) that “multiple sources with links to the intelligence communities of more than one five-eyes nation” have confirmed that there are indictments forthcoming for Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump, Jared Kushner, and Ivanka Trump. You will not want to hold your breath for that one. Advertisement
We have seen theories of Trump as Manchurian candidate, Trump as witting or unwitting Moscow intelligence asset, Trump as blackmail victim in hock to Russian oligarchs, etc. “Resistance fantasy Twitter,” Ruth Graham of Slate calls it.
One of the problems with having a man such as Donald Trump as president is that when you hear about, oh, possibly felonious hush-money payments to porn stars in order to cover up adultery, no sane and literate person says to himself: “My goodness! That doesn’t sound like the Donald Trump I know!” Of course it does. Who else would it sound like? Advertisement
But it is possible to lie about a scoundrel, to be dishonest about the dishonest. And, for some strange reason, the Democrats have latched onto the complaints about Trump that seem to be least rooted in fact, the narrative that is least connected to that which is documented and demonstrable. Advertisement
I would not have been shocked to learn that Trump or his minions broke a few statutes in the pursuit of dirt on Hillary Rodham Clinton that was held by Russian operatives. It certainly seems that that’s what that Trump Tower meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and those dodgy Russians was about: “to get information on an opponent,” as the president himself wrote on Twitter, “totally legal and done all the time in politics.” But a broad criminal conspiracy based on “collusion” with Moscow? Maybe there’s more forthcoming, but, based on the evidence that is actually available, there doesn’t seem to be much to that story.
“Oh, but wait for the tax returns!” they say. All right. I suspect that the president’s tax returns are going to be hilarious, but they are unlikely to tell us anything about Donald Trump that we did not know in 2016. Advertisement"
Pete Buttigieg’s Bad-Faith Attack on Mike Pence - National Review,www.nationalreview.com,,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/pete-buttigieg-attacks-mike-pence-bad-faith/,"April 10, 2019 6:30 AM Pete Buttigieg speaks at the 2019 National Action Network convention in New York City, April 4, 2019. (Lucas Jackson/Reuters) The vice president makes a convenient villain for the Left, regardless of the facts.
B ack in 2015, South Bend, Ind.’s mayor, Pete Buttigieg, came out of the closet as a gay man. Asked about the news, Indiana governor, Mike Pence, simply responded, “I hold Mayor Buttigieg in the highest personal regard. I see him as a dedicated public servant and a patriot.”
A year earlier, Buttigieg had been deployed to Afghanistan as a member of the U.S. Naval Reserve. According to the Indianapolis Star , “a noticeably moved Pence called Buttigieg the day he was driving to the base.” Advertisement Advertisement
There is no evidence that Pence has ever said an unkind word about or done an unkind thing to Buttigieg.
So, naturally, Buttigieg is attacking Pence as a homophobic bigot nearly every day on the campaign trail. Appearing on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert , Buttigieg sneered, “He’s nice. If he were here, you would think he’s a nice guy to your face. But he’s also fanatical.” Speaking at the LGBTQ Victory Fund National Champagne Brunch in Washington, Buttigieg tore into Pence’s supposed intolerance: “That’s the thing I wish the Mike Pences of the world would understand. That if you got a problem with who I am, your problem is not with me — your quarrel, sir, is with my creator.” This week, Buttigieg tweeted, clearly in reference to Pence, “People will often be polite to you in person, while advancing policies that harm you and your family. You will be polite to them in turn, but you need not stand for such harms. Instead, you push back, honestly and emphatically. So it goes, in the public square.”
This is a change for Buttigieg, whose best-selling memoir contains no negative references about Pence but complains of “the complications of being openly gay in Mike Pence’s Indiana.” That phraseology is more a critique of Pence’s policy preferences than his personality. Fair enough. Advertisement Advertisement
But Buttigieg is no longer operating in good faith. Now he’s attacking Christians who disagree with his policies and support Trump (“the hypocrisy is unbelievable”); he’s castigating Pence as a religious homophobe, characterizing him as an obstacle to tolerance. Why? Because it is far more convenient to cast Pence as a close-minded bigot than it is to respect him as a political opponent.
This has become a particularly popular tactic on the Left. When Pence swore in Senator Doug Jones (D., Ala.), the Leftist internet completely manufactured a narrative wherein Pence was deeply uncomfortable with Jones’s gay son ( Newsweek ’s headline: “Doug Jones’ Gay Son Gives Mike Pence Serious Side-Eye”). Gay Olympian Adam Rippon randomly decided to tear into Pence by stating that “for Mike Pence to say he’s a devout Christian man is completely contradictory.” When gay Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar and his husband attended breakfast with Pence, the media attempted to push a narrative about Pence’s supposed discomfort. When Pence’s wife began teaching at a Christian school, the media leapt to label her an anti-gay maniac.
There is no evidence for any of this. Pence has been dealing with gay men, including Buttigieg, his entire career. He differs from them on the definition of marriage. While I believe the government ought to exit the business of marriage altogether, there are plenty of public-policy reasons to stand for traditional marriage that aren’t rooted in animus. Advertisement Advertisement
More than that, it betrays a fundamental misunderstanding of religious people to suggest that their belief in the immorality of certain sexual behavior reflects animus for those who engage in that sexual behavior. Religious people generally believe that we all sin; that we all struggle with sin; and that participating in one particular type of sin doesn’t mean that the sinner is somehow inferior to those who engage in other types of sin."
William Barr: FBI Spied on Donald Trump Campaign | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Jack Crowe,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/news/william-barr-fbi-spying-on-donald-trump-campaign-did-occur/,"April 10, 2019 11:15 AM Attorney General William Barr testifies before a Senate Appropriations Subcommittee hearing in Washington, D.C., April 10, 2019. (Erin Scott/Reuters)
Attorney General William Barr told a Senate panel Wednesday that he believes American “intelligence agencies” did spy on the Trump campaign but said he has not yet determined whether there was a proper justification for that surveillance.
“I think spying did occur,” Barr said during a hearing before the Senate Appropriations Committee. “But the question is whether it was adequately predicated and I am not suggesting that it wasn’t adequately predicated. . . . I am not suggesting those rules were violated, but I think it is important to look at that. And I am not talking about the FBI necessarily, but intelligence agencies more broadly.”
“I think spying on a political campaign is a big deal — it’s a big deal,” he added.
Barr was addressing a question from Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D., N.H.) about the origins of the FBI’s counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign. Intelligence officials involved in the probe relied in part on the Steele dossier — an unsubstantiated opposition-research file compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele — to obtain a FISA warrant to surveil Carter Page, but did not tell the FISA court that the dossier was commissioned by a company contracted by the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign.

Barr told lawmakers Wednesday that he will form a team to investigate whether those FBI and Department of Justice officials misled the FISA court to further a partisan attack on Trump’s campaign.
“I’m not suggesting that those rules were violated, but I think it’s important to look at that,” Barr said.
“I am going to be reviewing both the genesis and the conduct of the intelligence activities directed at the Trump campaign during 2016,” he added."

(Lucas Jackson/Reuters)
The gun-maker Remington has asked the Supreme Court to intervene in a wrongful death lawsuit brought in Connecticut by the families of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting victims.
The appeal comes after a panel of the Connecticut supreme court overturned a lower court last month in ruling that Remington can be sued for the way in which it marketed the Bushmaster AR-15 that was used to kill 26 people at the Newtown school in December 2012.
Justice Richard Palmer, writing for the 4 – 3 majority, argued that the plaintiffs, which include nine victims’ families and one survivor, should be given the opportunity to demonstrate that Remington violated the law by marketing the AR-15 specifically to young people.
Remington’s attorneys informed the Connecticut high court on Friday that they would appeal to the Supreme Court to intervene in the suit on the grounds that the 2005 Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act shields gun manufacturers from liability if their products are used in criminal activity.

The Connecticut supreme court “recognized that guidance from the Supreme Court is needed by acknowledging that congressional intent to protect firearm manufacturers from litigation is not clear, and it is ‘possible that Congress intended to broadly immunize firearm sellers from liability’ for the conduct that Plaintiffs have alleged,” Remington’s lawyers, Scott Harrington and James Vogts, wrote in a motion filed Friday .
“If proceedings are not stayed and Remington is required to undergo the costly and time-consuming burdens of litigation, including further discovery, motion practice and possibly trial, it will irreparably lose the intended benefit of threshold PLCAA immunity from suit,” they continued."

(Edgar Su/Reuters)
New Zealand’s parliament on Wednesday voted almost unanimously to ban “military-style” semi-automatic weapons less than a month after 50 people were killed in mass shootings at a pair of mosques in the city of Christchurch.
The ban, which applies to semi-automatic rifles and shotguns capable of holding more than five rounds, was made permanent Wednesday after being unilaterally implemented by prime minister Jacinda Ardern just six days after the mosque shootings to prevent stockpiling.
“We are ultimately here because 50 people died, and they do not have a voice,” Ardern told parliament Wednesday. “We in this house are their voice, and today, we have used that voice wisely.”
Citizens in possession of banned guns will be granted a six-month buyback period, after which they will be subject to five years in prison if they remain in possession of prohibited weapons. The law provides exemptions for pest control professionals and licensed antique gun collectors. Stay Updated with NR Daily

President Trump on Wednesday continued his public campaign to impugn the credibility of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s findings, which are expected to be released in redacted form in the coming days.
“It was an illegal investigation. It was started illegally. Everything about it was crooked,” Trump told reporters outside the White House before departing to Texas. “This was an attempted coup. This was an attempted takedown of a president, and we beat them.”
Trump’s comments came just one day after Attorney General William Barr told a House panel that he would release a redacted version of Mueller’s 300-page report to Congress within the week and subsequently make a more heavily redacted version public.
Lawmakers on the House Appropriations Committee questioned Barr on Tuesday about the summary of Mueller’s report that he made public last month. In the four-page summary, Barr wrote that Mueller did not find evidence of a criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russian officials to disrupt the 2016 election. The summary further explained that Mueller did not make a determination as to whether Trump obstructed justice in firing FBI director James Comey, but that after reviewing the report, Barr had determined there wasn’t sufficient evidence to bring obstruction of justice charges."
Virginia Democratic & Ralph Northam Controversy: Rush to Judgement? | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Jim Geraghty,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/virginia-democratic-lawmakers-apologize-for-a-rush-to-judgment-on-ralph-northam/,"Follow Jim Geraghty on Twitter April 10, 2019 1:13 PM
Several Virginia Democratic lawmakers feel like they rushed to judgment against governor Ralph Northam and state attorney general Mark Herring.
“There were a lot of life lessons” learned from the wreckage in Richmond, said state Sen. Janet Howell (D-32nd). Chief among them? “Don’t rush to judgment.”
“I’m sorry we did,” said Howell, who also pilloried national Democratic leaders and presidential candidates for weighing in, early and sometimes loudly, on the Virginia situation. (“Ignore them,” Howell advised.)
State Sen. Barbara Favola (D-31st), who was among those to call for resignations only later to backtrack, acknowledged legislators were caught up in a media firestorm. “Statements were made before people even talked to the governor,” said Favola, who long has been an ally of Northam.
Because that’s what Virginia really needed as the cherry on top to this elaborate ice-cream sundae of embarrassment: an apology to Northam. Advertisement Advertisement
These Democratic lawmakers apparently believe they denounced Northam and Herring too hastily. To refresh, shortly after the yearbook photo of a person in blackface and another in Klan robes appeared, Northam initially offered and then quickly rescinded an apology for “the decision I made to appear as I did in this photo.” The following morning, Northam changed his story and claimed he was neither in blackface nor wearing the Klan hood, that he had no idea who was in the photo, that he had no idea how the photo ended up on his page in the yearbook, and that he had no idea how he got the nickname “Coon-man.” He then admitted wearing shoe polish on his face to imitative Michael Jackson in a dance contest — a strange tale that, intriguingly, no one has verified. During his infamous press conference, Northam said he only realized that darkening his face with shoe polish to resemble an African–American could be considered offensive during a conversation with a campaign aide during the 2017 campaign."
How Future Vacancies Could Transform the Federal Courts of Appeals | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Ed Whelan,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/bench-memos/how-future-vacancies-could-transform-the-federal-courts-of-appeals/,"Follow Ed Whelan on Twitter April 10, 2019 3:38 PM
Last month, I did a quick breakdown of the federal courts of appeals by party of appointing president (which is at best a very crude metric of judicial philosophy). Here I am going to take a harder look at how the composition of each court might change by the end of 2020. Advertisement Advertisement
In particular, I am going to identify which sitting judges are, or will soon be (i.e., by July 2020), eligible to take senior status or retire. I emphasize that in doing so I express no opinion whether any particular judge should take senior status or retire. I also offer no prediction on who might. As a general rule, judges appointed by Democratic presidents are much less likely than judges appointed by Republican presidents to step down.
I set forth in “Potential new” what the new composition of the court would be if all senior-eligible judges stepped down and were replaced by appointees of President Trump. That, of course, is a farfetched scenario . But it nonetheless might shed some light on the future, especially if President Trump wins a second term.
To avoid repeating the phrases “appointee of Republican president” and “appointee of Democratic president,” I will use the shorthands R and D. In doing so, I do not mean to suggest that judges are political partisans. I will also use V for vacancy. Advertisement

Senator Elizabeth Warren’s presidential campaign raised $6 million in the first quarter of this year, it reported Wednesday.
The campaign received over 213,000 contributions from more than 135,000 donors whose average donation was $28, according to Warren’s campaign manager Roger Lau. In the final week of the quarter, it pulled in more than $1.4 million, and now has $11.2 million in its coffers.
Warren’s fundraising numbers lag significantly behind those of her competitors for the Democratic nomination. Senator Bernie Sanders topped the list, pulling in a colossal $18.2 million in the first quarter, while Senator Kamala Harris raised $12 million, former representative Beto O’Rourke took in $9.4 million, and South Bend, Ind. mayor Pete Buttigieg pulled in $7 million."

Julian Assange Arrested: Wikileaks Founder Apprehended Outside Ecudaorian Embassy | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Jack Crowe,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/news/wikileaks-founder-julian-assange-arrested/,"April 11, 2019 7:24 AM Julian Assange on the balcony of the Ecuadorean embassy in London, May 2017 (Peter Nicholls / Reuters)
Update 9:31 a.m. : Hours after he was arrested at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, U.S. authorities announced they have charged Julian Assange with one count of conspiracy to hack a government computer. The charge stems from Assange’s role in hacking a confidential computer in 2010 in an effort to release classified documents.
Julian Assange, the Wikileaks founder who has made enemies of governments around the world by releasing confidential, and often embarrassing, intelligence documents to the public, was arrested Thursday at the Ecuadorian embassy in London by the British police.
The British metropolitan police explained in a statement released Thursday that Assange was arrested partly in connection with an extradition warrant filed by the U.S., which suggests he may be sent to the U.S. to stand trial.
The Department of Justice has charged Assange in connection with his publication of thousands of classified government documents, a fact they accidentally revealed in an unrelated court filing in February.
Assange was expelled from the Ecuadorian embassy, where he has lived for seven years, after “his repeated violations to international conventions and daily-life protocols” led Ecuadorian president Lenin Moreno to rescind his country’s protection.
Wikileaks announced last Friday that Ecuador “already has an agreement with the UK for his arrest.”
A video of Assange’s arrest shows him being carried down the steps of the embassy while shouting “the U.K. must resist.” Stay Updated with NR Daily

— WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) April 11, 2019
President Moreno, citing a recent Wikileaks expose on the Vatican, explained in a video statement that Assange was being expelled from the embassy for failing to uphold his pledge to stop meddling in the affairs of foreign nations. Assange first moved into the embassy in 2012 to avoid extradition to Sweden, where he was facing sexual assault charges.
Wikileaks rose to prominence in 2010 by releasing a cache of classified U.S. intelligence documents and diplomatic cables pertaining to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Chelsea Manning, a transgender woman formerly known as Bradley, was arrested for leaking those documents and was sentenced to 35 years in prison but was released after serving just seven.
Assange, 47, is also suspected of aiding Russia in their efforts to disrupt the 2016 election by publishing confidential and damaging Democratic National Committee and Clinton campaign documents. He has explicitly stated his desire to damage Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign but has long denied receiving the hacked documents from Russian agents, as American intelligence agencies allege."

2018 —“Progressive fury” (as CNN puts it) is unleashed on federal district nominee Wendy Vitter for declining to opine at her confirmation hearing whether she believes that Brown v. Board of Education was correctly decided. Malicious charges spread that Vitter supports racial segregation.
Never mind that, like many other nominees, Vitter took the position that it was improper for her to comment on the rightness or wrongness of any Supreme Court ruling. Never mind that she committed to apply all existing precedents. Never mind that she testified that racial segregation is immoral. Never mind that no one identified anything in her life or career to suggest that she is racially biased. Never mind that she has earned the support of Democrats like New Orleans mayor Mitch Landrieu (who, among other things, called for the removal of city monuments honoring leaders of the Confederacy).

What many on the Left really object to—or so it would seem from the questions posed at the hearing by Senate Democrats—is that Vitter is openly pro-life. Ed Whelan is the President of the Ethics and Public Policy Center. @EdWhelan123 "

Omar Hassan al-Bashir, the dictator of Sudan, has been removed from power.
His crimes, as the Washington Post put it, include “genocide against his own people.”
I have always been uncomfortable with that formulation–“against his own people” — for three reasons.
First, it is a cliché, and clichés should be avoided. (Like the plague, the copyeditors’ joke goes.) Advertisement Comments
Second, there’s that possessive pronoun. His people? The idea that the people belong to the potentate in the same ways that all the game in the forest used to be assumed to be royal property is an idea that, perhaps because of its formulation within a cliché, receives insufficient examination. Surely the people of Sudan belong to themselves, and not to the dictator.
Third, there’s the implicit moral argument that it is somehow worse to commit atrocities against one’s own subjects, as though it would be better to invade the country next door and commit genocide against “someone else’s people.” We heard a lot about how Saddam Hussein brutalized “his own people.” He brutalized a lot of other people, too. Did the Kurds of northern Iraq feel the Halabja massacre especially keenly, or did the Shia of Dujail, because they were the tyrant’s “own” people? Did the 50,000 to 100,000 Iranians killed by Iraqi chemical weapons say to themselves, as they died of asphyxiation in convulsions and terror, “Well, it least it wasn’t our own government!”"
"Michael Avenatti Indicted -- Grand Jury Points to Tax Dodging, Fraud, Stealing from Mentally Ill Client | National Review",www.nationalreview.com,Jack Crowe,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/news/avenatti-indicted-for-tax-dodging-fraud-stealing-from-mentally-ill-client/,"Follow Jack Crowe on Twitter April 11, 2019 11:43 AM Michael Avenatti speaks outside the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California in Los Angeles, Calif., September 24, 2018. (Andrew Cullen/Reuters)
Celebrity attorney Michael Avenatti was indicted by a federal grand jury Thursday on a host of financial and other crimes, including fraud, tax avoidance, and embezzling funds from clients, one of whom was a mentally ill paraplegic.
A Santa Ana grand jury charged that Avenatti created an extensive network of shell corporations to embezzle millions of dollars from five of his clients, the Los Angeles Times first reported . One of those clients, Geoffrey Ernest Johnson, a mentally ill paraplegic, won a $4 million settlement from Los Angeles County, which Avenatti hid from him for years, according to the indictment.
Johnson was awarded the settlement after paralyzing himself by jumping from an upper floor of the jail in which he was being held. Avenatti never informed Johnson of the $4 million settlement, and instead funneled it to GB Autosport, LLC — a company he established to manage his race-car team — and to his failed coffee company, Global Baristas LLC. He subsequently paid out small installments to Johnson and told him they were “advances” on the county settlement that he had not yet received.
The deception eventually led the Social Security Administration to revoke Johnson’s disability payments as he was unable to provide information about the settlement.
Avenatti, who was elevated to national fame by his near-nightly appearances on CNN and other cable outlets, also allegedly concealed another $2.75 million settlement from a client, which he used to purchase a private jet that has since been seized by federal authorities.
The embattled attorney was previously indicted in California on bank- and wire-fraud charges and in New York on extortion charges related to an alleged attempt to blackmail Nike, but the indictments handed down Thursday represent a dramatic escalation of his legal troubles: They could result in a maximum sentence of 335 years in prison."
Social Security Paid Leave: Program Actuaries Weigh In | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Robert Verbruggen,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/conservative-paid-leave-proposal-social-security-chief-actuary-weighs-in/,"April 11, 2019 2:27 PM (Marcos Brindicci/Reuters)
. . . via a letter sent, at their request, to Senator Marco Rubio and Representative Ann Wagner. As you may know, the proposal of theirs at issue would allow parents to take paid leave through Social Security in exchange for delaying retirement. According to information put out by Rubio’s office , “ nearly all parents below the median household income of about $60,000 will be able to take significant leave at a rate of two-thirds of their prior wages, ” with richer parents receiving a lower replacement rate. Advertisement Advertisement
This is self-evidently a fantastic idea, in my humble opinion, but a key issue is how it would affect Social Security. It’s important to get the math right, so that the system breaks even when parents take X months off and then, years later, delay their retirement by Y months.
The ratio of Y to X will be determined by the Social Security commissioner, but the letter estimates it will be about 2:1, meaning each month of leave will be paid for with two months of delayed retirement. Alternatively, someone taking leave could opt to have their benefits reduced for the first five years of their retirement, though the precise calculations for that option are rather arcane.
The letter assumes that 40 percent of parents would take the benefit for 2.5 months per child, starting in 2022, and that the program would sunset in 2032. Obviously the program would most likely be extended, so this should be seen as an estimate of the cost for just its first ten years. Advertisement"

Over at Larry Sabato’s “Crystal Ball” site , Kyle Kondik observes that considering the size of the field and the Democratic party’s way of allocating delegates — no winner-take-all states, just a 15 percent threshold to win any delegates — the primary season could end with no candidate winning the necessary number of delegates and “the Democratic National Convention could hypothetically go to a second ballot.” Advertisement Advertisement
(Those who would like to see a party convention be newsworthy again will be cheering for this scenario.)
There’s a good chance that the 15 percent rule is going to cause Democrats headaches. Somebody at some point is going to win 13 or 14 percent of the vote a state primary and not get any delegates, and that candidate and their supporters are likely to be furious. You will probably hear a lot of cries of “rigged!” and claims that the process is unfair — or that it even represents “voter suppression” of some kind.

Does the leading candidate get 100 percent of the delegates? Unless there’s a clear frontrunner, a lot of candidates will scream that the process is unfair and rigged against them. Advertisement"

A reader who is very knowledgeable about the federal courts has asked me to list all federal appellate judges who are eligible to take senior status and who are 75 or older. His premise is that once judges get around that age, they are more likely to take senior status irrespective whether the sitting president is of the same party as the president who appointed them. I don’t know whether that premise is true, but I will nonetheless indulge his request. Advertisement Advertisement
I set forth below the senior-eligible federal appellate judges who will be 75 or older by the end of 2019 . I emphasize that some of the judges on the list have passed over plenty of opportunities to retire. Judge Tjoflat, for example, turns 90 in December. He became eligible to take senior status in 1994, so there is no particular reason to expect him to take it now.

Wikileaks' Julian Assange Provides a Window into America’s Polarized Soul | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,David French,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/julian-assange-was-a-window-into-americas-polarized-soul/,"Follow David French on Twitter April 11, 2019 4:02 PM WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is seen in a police van after he was arrested by British police outside the Ecuadorian embassy in London, England, April 11, 2019. (Henry Nicholls/Reuters) The view he revealed is ugly, petty, and deeply dispiriting.
J ulian Assange’s arrest and indictment should provide us with a moment of reflection. He is an awful man. He dumped American military secrets into the public domain without any regard for human life. He conspired with an American soldier to crack American security systems in the effort to deliver more secrets to the world public. Advertisement Advertisement
His co-conspirator, Chelsea (then Bradley) Manning, wasn’t a “whistleblower” — and neither was Assange. Manning didn’t carefully extract evidence of alleged wrongdoing from classified files and go to the press (a defensible, though still illegal, act). He just dumped hundreds of thousands of pages of classified files into Assange’s hands, and Assange posted them, en masse , on the Internet.
Any jihadist or enemy with Internet access could read the documents and not just learn about the identities of American allies on the ground (placing them at immediate, mortal risk) but also gain extraordinary insight into American military tactics and plans — including learning exactly how effective (or ineffective) their own weapons and tactics were.
Manning committed treason. Assange helped him. And there were Americans who celebrated both men. Manning got a Vogue profile . Assange was the object of admiration. Remember when Atlantic contributor David Samuels wrote that Assange had performed a “ huge public service ”?
Not since President Richard Nixon directed his minions to go after Pentagon Papers leaker Daniel Ellsberg and New York Times reporter Neil Sheehan —“a vicious antiwar type,” an enraged Nixon called him on the Watergate tapes — has a working journalist and his source been subjected to the kind of official intimidation and threats that have been directed at Assange and Manning by high-ranking members of the Obama administration.
Some even called Assange a “ darling of the liberal left .” Republicans and mainstream liberals held a different view. The Obama administration condemned him, conservatives called him a traitor, and Donald Trump said WikiLeaks was “disgraceful,” adding that there should be the “death penalty or something” for its actions.
Fast-forward to 2016, and WikiLeaks enjoyed a reputational renaissance on the right. Why? Well, WikiLeaks was the same organization, but its target had changed. Rather than taking on alleged American imperialism, it was the conduit for an alleged Russian hack that was systematically embarrassing Hillary Clinton and the Democratic party in the middle of a hotly contested presidential election. Advertisement
“ I love WikiLeaks ,” Trump declared to rousing cheers at a rally. Sean Hannity defended him during the election and even referred to Assange to advance his absurd Seth Rich conspiracy theory . Advertisement
Even worse, the special counsel’s office has alleged that a “senior Trump Campaign official was directed to contact Stone about any additional releases and what other damaging information [WikiLeaks] had regarding the Clinton Campaign.” Trump “loved” Wikileaks, and his campaign allegedly endeavored to get information from WikiLeaks — the same organization that had just a few years before conspired with a traitor to place American soldiers and American allies in mortal danger.
Julian Assange intentionally and deliberately works against American interests. Yet there are Americans who will intentionally and deliberately share WikiLeaks information, wield it as a weapon against their political opponents, and even attempt to make contact with Assange himself when it serves their domestic political interests. Advertisement
There is no virtue in Assange. Those who celebrated his “transparency” in the Manning document dumps forget that responsible reporters who gain access to classified material carefully vet that material to make sure that their disclosures do not needlessly endanger innocent Americans, and they carefully weigh the value of the disclosure against the gravity of the harm. Assange and Manning did not seem to care about the men and women they betrayed.
Those who celebrated Assange’s role in the DNC and Podesta hacks forget that he was playing a willing and even eager role in a foreign plan to disrupt an election and divide our nation — a plan that worked beautifully in large part because of the very celebration of the hacks themselves. In “Flight 93 elections,” I suppose, advancing Russian interests is a small price to pay for a news cycle or two that humiliates Hillary. Advertisement"
Lisa Neubauer & Brian Hagedorn -- How Wisconsin Conservatives Scored a Stunning Upset | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,John Mccormack,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/how-conservatives-scored-a-stunning-upset-in-wisconsin/,"April 11, 2019 4:15 PM (Carlos Jasso/Reuters)
On Wednesday, liberal-backed Wisconsin supreme court candidate Lisa Neubauer formally conceded to conservative-backed Brian Hagedorn after the official canvas of the vote only increased Hagedorn’s lead of roughly 6,000 votes out of 1.2 million ballots cast.
As we reported last week, Hagedorn’s victory was nothing short of stunning. His campaign had been left for dead by some business groups in the state after his opponents attacked him as an anti-LGBT bigot for founding a private Christian school that upholds traditional Christian beliefs about marriage and sex. The Wisconsin Realtors Association withdrew its endorsement, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce decided to stay out of the race. Advertisement Advertisement
But the business community’s squeamishness in Wisconsin was not shared by Republican leaders and conservative activists. Former governor Scott Walker, Senator Ron Johnson, and conservative talk radio stood by Hagedorn.
The libertarian Americans for Prosperity executed its ground game as planned, working hand-in-hand with a record number of volunteers, many of whom were social conservatives outraged by what they saw as an attack on Hagedorn’s faith.
And the Republican State Leadership Committee (RSLC) provided critical air support to Hagedorn during the last week of the campaign. The Wisconsin Democracy Campaign reported that liberal groups backing Neubauer outspent conservative groups backing Hagedorn by as much as a 14-1 margin until the last week of the race, when the RSLC swooped in with a million-dollar ad campaign. It didn’t erase the disparity between conservative and liberal spending in the state, but did narrow the gap. Advertisement
As officials at the RSLC explain in a memo , the organization found Hagedorn down 8 points—42 percent to 34 percent—a little more than one week before the election. But the poll also showed that they had a path to victory by turning out the conservative base that had sat out a state supreme court race in 2018, when the liberal judicial candidate defeated the conservative by 12 percentage points. Advertisement
“Through the polling we identified that Judge Hagedorn’s biggest challenge was that he was not winning among Republicans (+50%) as much as his opponent was winning among Democrats (+71%). Equalizing the partisan intensity made this a two point race,” the memo states.
One message promoted by the RSLC was that liberal special interest groups were smearing Hagedorn “just like they did against Justice Kavanaugh.” Advertisement"
Julian Assange & Statute of Limitations -- A Hot Dispute in the Assange Case | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Andrew C.

The indictment that the Justice Department filed against Julian Assange in the Eastern District of Virginia charges him with a conspiracy to commit computer fraud. The conspiracy statute is Section 371 of the penal code, and the computer fraud offenses that were the objectives of the conspiracy are parts of Section 1030 . Advertisement Advertisement
According to the indictment, Assange and Manning (then known as Bradley, now as Chelsea) conspired in 2010. Manning was prosecuted by the armed forces. The Justice Department’s indictment against Assange was not returned until 2018 — eight years later.
The five-year statute of limitations that applies to most federal crimes is prescribed for both conspiracy and computer fraud.
So how is the Justice Department able to prosecute Assange on an indictment filed three years after the prescribed limitations period?
It appears that the Justice Department is relying on an exception, in Section 2332b of the penal code, that extends the statute of limitations to eight years for “acts of terrorism transcending national boundaries.” Advertisement
Now, conspiracy to commit computer fraud is a very serious offense, and Assange’s is at the top of the seriousness range because it involved publication of defense secrets that endangered lives, including the lives of our troops. And there’s no doubt that the conspiracy transcended national boundaries — Assange was outside the U.S. when he collaborated with Manning. But is it really an act of terrorism ? Advertisement
It may be . . . at least as the operative term — federal crime of terrorism — is defined by Section 2332b.
Under subsection (g)(5) of that statute, an offense is considered a “federal crime of terrorism” if it satisfies two elements: (1) it “is calculated to influence or affect the conduct of government by intimidation or coercion, or to retaliate against government conduct”; and (2) it is a violation of one of a long list of offenses, which includes “section . . . 1030(a)(1) (relating to protection of computers)[.]” Stay Updated with NR Daily
NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.
We should stress here — because this point is sure to be butchered (by some, intentionally) in the public debate — that the issue is not whether what Assange is accused of doing strikes you as an act of terrorism in the commonly understood sense of that term. The question is: Does it fit Congress’s definition of a federal crime of terrorism, as spelled out in Section 2332b, which controls the statute of limitations? If it does, the eight-year statute of limitations applies. Advertisement Advertisement
It seems to me that Assange and Manning were certainly retaliating against the U.S. government, and trying to coerce the government into changing policy. And the offense alleged does indeed involve computer fraud under Section 1030(a)(1).
Under the statute, that should be enough. But it will be a hotly contested issue."

(Mary F. Calvert/Reuters)
Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell said Thursday that the U.S. needs a “referendum on socialism” in the 2020 congressional elections and that the Republican Party will be on the front lines against it.
“We need to have a referendum on socialism,” the Kentucky Republican told reporters. “I’m going to be arguing, and I’m encouraging my colleagues to argue, that we are the firewall against socialism in this country.”
Republicans will have to defend 22 Senate seats in 2020, compared to the Democrats’ 12 seats.
“If you’re uncomfortable with things like the Green New Deal and Medicare for none, the best way to avoid that is to have a Republican Senate,” McConnell said.
Six senators who have thrown their hat in the ring for the Democratic presidential nomination have thrown their support behind the Green New Deal: Senators Amy Klobuchar, Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker, and Kirsten Gillibrand.
Meanwhile, all of those presidential candidates except for Klobuchar have sponsored Sanders’ Medicare for All plan, although they have not all called for the effective end of the private health insurance market, as the Vermont independent and self-described democratic socialist has done.

Klobuchar, who tends right of her opponents for the Democratic nomination, has pushed instead for an optional buy-in to a government health care plan, saying she is “looking at something that will work now” rather than later.
“If we can’t make that case, we ought to go into another line of work,” McConnell said.

‘Tax the Rich’ and 'Pay Their Fair Share' Demands Unreasonable | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Jonah Goldberg,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/tax-rich-pay-fair-share-demands-unreasonable/,"April 12, 2019 6:30 AM A demonstrator protests the Republican tax plan as it works through the Senate, November 2017. (James Lawler Duggan/Reuters) Suggesting that people who don’t want to pay even more are unpatriotic is bullying nonsense.
I f I told you there was a movement to create a navy or an air force, you might respond, “Don’t we already have those?” If I said we need a movement to persuade bears to relieve themselves in the woods, you might say, “Wait. Isn’t that happening already?”
But if I said we needed to tax the rich, a lot of people’s first reaction would be, “Yes! It’s about time!” Advertisement Advertisement
In fact, there’s an astroturf movement based on precisely this notion. There was just a big conference, fittingly named the “Tax the Rich!” conference, hosted by a group called Patriotic Millionaires.
“Tax the Rich. Save America. Yes, it really is that simple,” they explain in their mission statement.
This slogan is simply dishonest; rich people do, in fact, pay taxes. Just under half (48 percent) of federal revenue comes from income taxes. If you define the rich as the top 1 percent — which is probably too narrow, depending on the region of the country — the rich pay a big chunk of that. In 2016, according to the Tax Foundation, the top 1 percent accounted for 37.3 percent of all income-tax revenue, a share that was greater than the bottom 90 percent of all payers of income tax combined. The top half of taxpayers paid 97 percent of income taxes. Advertisement
The Tax Policy Center estimates that 44 percent of Americans won’t pay any federal income taxes for 2018. That doesn’t mean they don’t pay any taxes, of course. Payroll taxes eat up a big chunk of many Americans’ paychecks — a fact we all learn the first time we shout, “Who the hell is FICA!?” Advertisement
But the income tax is remarkably progressive. Once again citing the Tax Policy Center (a joint project of two left-of-center think tanks: the Brookings Institution and the Urban Institute), Americans in the top 20 percent paid an estimated 87 percent of income taxes for 2018. This was up from 84 percent in 2017, which means that the “Trump tax cuts” actually made the tax code more progressive.
The folks shouting “Tax the rich!” know this, which is why, when they move beyond sloganeering, they say that what they really want is for the rich to “pay their fair share.” This is a more debatable claim because “fair” is in the eye of the beholder. It’s not preposterous to argue that the rich, however defined, should pay a few percentage points more in income tax in the name of fairness. But it’s also not preposterous to say that when 1 percent of the people provide more than a third of income-tax revenue, they’re already paying their fair share — and suggesting that people who don’t want to pay even more are “unpatriotic” is bullying nonsense. Advertisement
While we’re on the topic of fairness, there’s another common argument for hiking income taxes for the wealthy, or for even simply taxing wealth itself: The rich deserve it. Or, to be more generous, the super-rich don’t deserve their money, while the rest of the country does. Advertisement
The New York Times ’ Farhad Manjoo recently argued for “abolishing” billionaires outright. Presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren and Beto O’Rourke say we should make the rich less rich because income inequality is bad. Candidate Bernie Sanders and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (and many others) think that everything from Medicare for All to the Green New Deal can be financed largely — or entirely — by pillaging the bank accounts of the rich.
This is populist insanity masquerading as public finance. According to the Manhattan Institute’s Brian Riedl, doubling the top tax brackets (from 35 and 37 percent to 70 and 74 percent) “would close just one-fifth of the long-term Social Security and Medicare shortfall. Even seizing all annual income earned over $500,000 would not come close.”
You could literally confiscate 100 percent of the wealth of the entire 1 percent and not come close to paying for Sanders’s version of Medicare for All (price tag: $32 trillion). Advertisement"
Federal Reserve Balance-Sheet Policy: A Credit Card for Uncle Sam | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,David Beckworth,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/federal-reserve-balance-sheet-policy/,"April 12, 2019 6:30 AM Federal Reserve in Washington, D.C. (Kevin Lamarque/Reuters) He can now tap the Fed to fund spending activities.
U ncle Sam has a new credit card. It’s flashy and different. It’s also potentially destabilizing — but like many people who get a new credit card, he’s thrilled to have it and is having a hard time seeing any downside to its use. This enthusiasm could prove to be shortsighted for the long-run health of U.S. finances. Advertisement
For most of his life, Uncle Sam has relied on an older, less flashy credit card. It is accepted everywhere and by everyone and comes with an incredibly low interest rate. It’s served him well and has allowed him, at times, to run up large balances without becoming viewed as a credit risk. This older credit card is better known as the U.S. Treasury, and its “balances,” now near $15.5 trillion, are the U.S. public debt.
The new credit card is not accepted everywhere. In fact, very few places take it, and typically it charges a higher interest rate than the older card. It is, in other words, inferior, but Uncle Sam seems happy to have it at his disposal. After several years of trying it out, he officially became a permanent card holder this year. The new credit card is the Federal Reserve, and its “balances,” now near $1.5 trillion, are excess bank reserves.
The new card arrived in January, when the Federal Reserve announced it was going to indefinitely stick with its post-financial crisis “floor” operating system. This system allows the size of our central bank’s balance sheet to be independent from its stance on monetary policy. Advertisement
What does this mean? Well, for example, the Fed can now expand its balance sheet by creating money to purchase new assets without causing its target interest rate to change. The Fed, in other words, can now make new money without adding stimulus to the economy. This money, however, can only be used by banks and is why Uncle Sam cannot use this new credit card everywhere. Advertisement
This money is called excess bank reserves and, unlike cash, earns a return from the Fed called interest on excess reserves (IOER). The IOER typically has been higher than the return on treasury bills. Banks have been eager, therefore, to hold all excess bank reserves sent their way. But this is also what makes Uncle Sam’s new credit card more expensive than the old one.
The Fed’s floor system, in short, has turned part of its balance sheet into a credit card for Uncle Sam. He can tap the excess-reserves option at any time to fund spending activities. Advertisement
So far, Uncle Sam has used the new card only to transfer balances from the older Treasury card. That is, the Fed took Treasury debt off the market and in its place put excess reserves. But as any financial planner can tell you, paying off one credit card with another, higher-interest card — and one accepted by fewer merchants — is poor debt management. Moreover, the balances on Uncle Sam’s older credit card are a much sought-after asset in the global financial system. Uncle Sam, consequently, strains global financial markets when he transfers balances onto the new one. Advertisement
Going forward, Uncle Sam is likely to see the balances grow on his new credit card for several reasons: First, whenever the next recession happens, the Fed is likely to rely on “quantitative easing” — buying up financial assets to spur the economy — because there will be little room to cut interest rates. Second, at some point, the temptation for politicians to use the new credit card to fund new activity such as the Green New Deal, and not just balance transfers, will inevitably become too hard to resist.
This not only will result in poor debt management and global financial strain but also might push inflation uncomfortably high. To avoid this outcome, Uncle Sam should transfer credit balances back onto the older, lower-interest card, and shut down the new one. Advertisement"
Supreme Court Case Weighs State Liquor Laws and 21st Amendment | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Caleb Whitmer,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/state-liquor-laws-21st-amendment-supreme-court-case/,"April 12, 2019 6:30 AM Liquor store in Louisville, Ky., in 2014. (John Sommers II/Reuters) Many states’ regulations seem more designed to suppress competition than to encourage safety.
T his year marks the 100th anniversary of the beginning of Prohibition. While that odd chapter in American history officially concluded with the 21st Amendment’s ratification in 1933, the restless ghosts of a 14-year national experiment in teetotallery still haunt the country’s bars, liquor stores, and breweries. The contradictions and ironies of Prohibition, which is now a shorthand cliché for well-intentioned government regulation gone awry, have only deepened with time. Today, the labyrinth-like legal apparatus constructed in Prohibition’s wake is just as likely to provide protection for entrenched alcohol interests as it is to encourage the responsible distribution and sale of beer, wine, and spirits. Advertisement
Consider Tennessee. To obtain a liquor license, applicants must have lived in the state for a minimum of two years, but reapplying for the one-year license requires applicants to have lived there for at least a decade. The state’s liquor-store lobbying organization has argued that the residency requirement ensures that merchants are locals who have a vested interest in keeping their communities safe , but one doesn’t need the cynicism of a Chicago mobster to understand the rule’s protectionist subtext. The Supreme Court is expected to release its decision on the constitutionality of Tennessee’s residency requirement by summer, and a ruling against the regulation could loosen some of the grip states have over alcohol under the 21st Amendment. For consumers, that would be a nice Prohibition-anniversary gift.
Whatever the original intent, in practice, many of today’s regulations on alcohol have very little to do with promoting a healthy relationship between the American people and alcoholic beverages. At the end of Prohibition, states assumed near-total control of the traffic of alcohol within their borders, a move later protected by the Supreme Court’s broad interpretation of the 21st Amendment . The swing from total to minimal federal control splashed the country, à la Jackson Pollock, with a dizzying miscellany of regulations diverging sometimes wildly between states, counties, and towns. Advertisement
Mississippi is a great example of this oddly charming mess. It’s notable as the only state in the country to allow alcohol consumption while driving, so long as the person’s blood-alcohol content doesn’t rise above the legal limit. The state’s permissiveness toward automobile operators, however, is a peculiar anomaly in an otherwise long history of exacting alcohol regulations.
In fact, Mississippi was the last state to end prohibition fully. It legalized beer in 1933, but liquor had to wait another 30 years. When the sale of liquor finally did become legal, Mississippi permitted it only through a state-run Alcoholic Beverage Control authority similar, though by no means identical, to agencies in states such as Virginia, North Carolina, and roughly a dozen others. Until 2012, Mississippi banned the sale of beer with an alcohol-by-volume content of more than 6.25 percent , and it didn’t allow breweries to sell beer on-site until 2017 . Advertisement
Undoubtedly, such restrictions made more sense when the state still outlawed liquor, and local breweries were more prominent suppliers of beer. More recently, though, these laws have produced ridiculous contradictions. Why should the state have capped the alcohol content of beer at 6.25 percent, for instance, when it permitted the sale of much stronger wines and liquors? Meanwhile, the brewery-sales restriction, among other regulations, was stifling to the state’s craft-brewery entrepreneurs: In 2012, the state had exactly one craft brewery. By comparison, neighbors Louisiana and Alabama each had about ten. Surely, if Budweiser is widely available, Mississippi beer — which creates local industry, jobs, and something for the state’s official tourism organization to brag about — should be, too. Advertisement
To their credit, state lawmakers eventually identified these contradictions (thanks, in part, to the lobbying efforts of a grassroots organization called Raise Your Pints ) and revised some of Mississippi’s beer rules accordingly. This wave of reform included ending the last statewide ban on homebrewing (though it remains illegal in the roughly one third of Mississippi’s counties that remain dry). Today Mississippi is home to at least a dozen craft breweries.
Some state legislators have attempted similar liberalizing efforts for rules on wine but have met less success. Mississippi is one of five states that still ban wine shipments directly to consumers, a consumer trend that has exploded across the country in recent years, including in Mississippi despite its illegality. Out-of-state wine sellers have reportedly sent thousands of bottles into the state, much to the chagrin of the state’s alcohol regulators, who are missing out on tax revenue. (Last August, a county judge dismissed a lawsuit brought by Mississippi’s attorney general against several of these companies, citing lack of personal jurisdiction to hear and decide the case.) For the past few years, Mississippi lawmakers have introduced bills to roll back the ban. Undoubtedly, the prudence of such a policy — whether it is, in fact, good for Mississippi to permit direct-to-consumer wine shipments from out of state — should be debated, weighing the benefits of such a policy to consumers while, say, questioning how easily minors in search of booze could exploit it. It’s doubtful, however, that such considerations are really driving the debate. Advertisement Advertisement
For the state’s liquor-store owners, mail-order wine is simply bad for business. “It wouldn’t be good to lose the revenue if [customers] could just order from home and get it directly from the manufacturer,” Shawn Guider, owner of Petit Bois Liquors in Biloxi, told a local TV station . “We would lose the sales here.” Lobbyists representing Guider and liquor-store owners around the state (who, it’s worth noting, are basically state contractors under Mississippi’s Alcoholic Beverage Control authority) opposed the legislation, and it died in committee in early February. Advertisement Advertisement
There is a reason mail-order wine has caught fire in recent years: People like it. More than providing consumers with an Amazon-like shopping center, online wine clubs often help consumers figure out what wines they like and connect them to new wines they’ve never tried. Getting wine in the mail is not exactly a crucial service, essential to living the good life in America, but it’s nice. Government taxation and entrenched business interests being what they are, however, it seems unlikely that Mississippians will have (legal) access to these services anytime soon.
The scenes and themes of Mississippi’s alcohol dramas are performed regularly around the country, just with different players. A Supreme Court battle over liquor-license residency requirements could have started in any number of states besides Tennessee. In fact, 33 others (including Mississippi) and the District of Columbia all signed on to the suit in support of Tennessee’s stringent rules. More than just a question about the constitutionality of a particular regulation, though, Tennessee Wine and Spirits Retailers Association v. Blair could end up having profound implications on the states’ authority over alcohol under the 21st Amendment. Advertisement
TWSRA v. Blair began when Tennessee’s alcohol regulators were poised to grant liquor licenses to two store owners who did not meet the two-year requirement (one license was for liquor-store megachain Total Wine, the other for a family operation in Memphis ). TWSRA, a trade association representing the state’s liquor stores, threatened to sue if the state did not follow the law and deny their applications. In other words, industry reps used restrictive licensing requirements to keep out competition in a move so ham-fisted that it could be a case study for an Economics 101 class on “rent-seeking” and the unintended consequences of regulation. Tennessee’s alcohol regulators complied, although, one gets the sense, somewhat reluctantly.
During Supreme Court arguments last month, Justice Brett Kavanaugh expressed skepticism about the rather tortured reading of the 21st Amendment that justifies rules such as Tennessee’s. The amendment’s language prohibits the “transportation or importation” of alcohol into states that don’t want it, while saying nothing explicit about other powers the states have over alcohol regulation. The very existence of the 21st Amendment, however, implies that the Constitution views alcohol as different from other goods. The question is how different — and what does that difference mean to the states? The Court is considering TWSRA v. Blair in context of the Constitution’s protections for interstate commerce. It will likely decide whether Tennessee’s liquor-licensing rules are discriminatory against the residents of other states — and then whether the 21st Amendment actually allows such discrimination. Meanwhile, Justices Elena Kegan and Neil Gorsuch “fretted aloud” that a ruling against the two-year rule would undermine other state regulations on alcohol and welcome further legal challenges.
TWSRA’s view of state authority over alcohol is unsurprisingly broad. Representing the organization, attorney Shay Dvoretzky argued before the Court that the 21st Amendment does not have an “economic protectionism” exception. Even if Tennessee’s residency requirement is more concerned with protecting local businesses than with promoting safe alcohol consumption or supporting consumers, Tennessee is well within its rights to enforce it. Justice Stephen Breyer noted that past courts seemed to concur with that understanding of the 21st Amendment: “The history favors the other side,” Breyer told Total Wine’s attorney. A little later, while reflecting on the last century of alcohol laws, Breyer added : “Not all laws make that much sense.”"
FBI Trump Investigation: Legitimate Concern or Partisan Malice? | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Rich Lowry,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/mueller-probe-fbi-investigation-questions/,"April 12, 2019 6:30 AM Attorney General William Barr testifies on Capitol Hill, April 10, 2019. (Erin Scott/Reuters) The Mueller probe was a national trauma.
A ttorney General William Barr dared to use the “s-word.”
He said in congressional testimony that the Trump campaign had been spied on by the U.S. government. Pressed by incredulous Senate Democrats, he clarified: “I think spying did occur. The question is whether it was adequately predicated.”
“Spying” has a negative connotation, so perhaps “surveilling” would be the better way to put it. But a key question is indeed whether there was “improper surveillance” of the campaign, as Barr stated at another point in the hearing. Advertisement
Barr is committed to reviewing the conduct of the Russia investigation, which is getting denounced as an outrage by his critics. But why shouldn’t the attorney general seek to understand his department’s role in the high-stakes investigative melodrama of the past two years?
The Mueller probe was a national trauma. Its boosters didn’t experience it as such, of course. They enjoyed it and played it up and hoped for the very worst. But it cast a shadow over the White House, occupied an inordinate share of the nation’s political attention, and saddled innocent people with large legal bills. Advertisement
And for what? To establish that the far-fetched theory that the Russians coordinated with the Trump campaign indeed wasn’t true, and to take a pass on pronouncing one way or the other whether President Donald Trump allegedly obstructed justice?
You don’t have to be a deep-state conspiracy theorist to want to know how this got started and why. Advertisement
We should try to find out as reliably as possible how much FBI and other officials were legitimately freaked out by some of the Russia connections of Trump associates, and how much they were acting in an amateurish panic and out of partisan malice.
How was it that a garbage anti-Trump dossier gathered by an ex–foreign spy from shadowy Russian sources came to set so much of the media narrative about the Russia probe, and evidently have an outsize influence on the thinking and the actions of the FBI? Advertisement
It may be that without the dossier, there wouldn’t have been a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant against Carter Page. Barr is surely at least thinking of Page when he talks of spying. It’s true that the FISA warrant on Page was approved after he had left the campaign, but the surveillance would have extended both forward and backward in time, to likely include campaign communications.
And the FBI obviously had the campaign in mind. It wrote in the FISA application, “The FBI believes that the Russian government’s efforts are being coordinated with Page & perhaps other individuals associated with [Trump’s] campaign.” Advertisement
How was it that the FBI opened an investigation against the president when he fired its director? And why did it apparently think it could make an obstruction-of-justice case against Trump for acting within his lawful powers?
In the aftermath of the firing of James Comey, why did Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appoint Robert Mueller, in part, to investigate the cashiering of Comey that he was party to, and without specifying the crime that the president was being investigated for, as required under the special-counsel regulation?
The appointment of Mueller was so momentous because once you have a special counsel, even a highly professional one, you have an investigative beast roaming the landscape that will inevitably command an enormous amount of attention and find crimes to prosecute even if they are removed from his original charge.
Of course, this is one of the reasons why Mueller had such fervent support among Trump’s detractors. But there is no reason that Barr should share their assumptions, or their horror at the idea of finding out more about the investigation that they portrayed as the single most important event in American public life.

Georgetown University student government passed a referendum Thursday night that, if approved by the administration, would create a reparations fund to compensate the descendants of slaves who were sold to keep the university open.
A campus group called the GU272 Advocacy Team (in a nod to the 272 slaves the school sold in 1838 to pay off its outstanding debts) created the referendum, which calls for the implementation of a $27.70 per-semester fee to create a reconciliation fund that would be overseen by a board comprised of students and slave descendants.
The group estimates the fund would raise more than $400,000 annually to “be allocated for charitable purposes directly benefiting the descendants of the GU272 and other persons once enslaved by the Maryland Jesuits,” according to the bill, which was obtained by CNN .
“The vestiges of slavery are still so evident, and so many of the African Americans whose ancestors were enslaved are still so disenfranchised,” GU272 member Eliza Dunni Phillips told CNN. “It’s not enough to say sorry. Georgetown has to put their money where their mouth is and invest into the descendant community.” Stay Updated with NR Daily

Omar al-Bashir: Sudanese President Must Face Justice for Genocides | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Nina Shea,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/sudans-bashir-must-face-justice-for-his-genocides/,"April 12, 2019 2:35 PM Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir delivers a speech inside Parliament in Khartoum, Sudan, April 1, 2019. (Mohamed Nureldin Abdallah/Reuters) One of the world’s most brutal dictators has just fallen. What comes next is key.
S udan’s long-time president, Omar al Bashir — among the world’s most ruthless rulers — was arrested yesterday in a military coup that followed four months of popular protests in Khartoum, the country’s capital. Whatever other charges he will face for terror and corruption, he should be promptly tried for his worst offense: genocide.
In 70 years since the adoption of the U.N.’s Genocide Convention, only two genocides have been officially recognized by the U.S. government while they were still occurring. The first was the Bashir regime’s genocide in the western Darfur region. In mid 2004, a few months after the Darfur conflict began and a few months before the Bush administration recognized the genocide, the State Department dispatched a team to refugee camps across the border in Chad. The team interviewed survivors from the Muslim Fur, Masalit, and Zaghawa tribes, which were targeted for extermination.
A preeminent expert in the field, Gregory Stanton, summarized the “shocking” survey results:
Over 60 percent of the people interviewed had witnessed the killing of a family member. Two-thirds had witnessed the killing of a non-family member. Over 80 percent had witnessed destruction of a village. Two-thirds had witnessed aerial bombing of villages by the Sudanese government. And perhaps most chillingly, one-third had heard racial epithets used while they or their relatives were being murdered or raped. Assailants often shouted, “Kill the slaves” and “We have orders to kill all the blacks.”
The survey’s findings convinced the administration to declare the Bashir regime’s campaign in Darfur a racially motivated genocide. All told, the State Department estimates that over 300,000 tribesmen have died in in the region, and hundreds of thousands remain displaced today.
Despite an arrest warrant for genocide issued against him by the International Criminal Court in 2010, Bashir remained president and protected from prosecution. He continued to receive crucial diplomatic and financial support from Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Egypt, Turkey, Russia, South Africa, China, and the Arab League, among others.
As I wrote 15 years ago in these pages, Darfur should be counted as Bashir’s second genocide. He waged the first from the early 1990s to 2002, against the Christians and animists of southern Sudan and the people of the Nuba Mountains. That bloody campaign was undertaken in response to a rebellion against the forcible imposition of sharia law, which violated guarantees of southern autonomy included in the 1972 Addis Ababa Agreement. Though the Nuba are mostly Muslim, they resisted Bashir’s call to jihad against the south and were consequently declared “apostates,” marked for death along with non-Muslims, in a 1993 government fatwa. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement
Over 2 million eventually perished and 5 million were displaced as a result. Bashir used, as he would again in Darfur, a combination of military and militia tactics, inflicting deliberate mass starvation and sanctioning widespread rape, enslavement, and bombing and strafing of hospitals, schools, and other civilian structures. It ended in 2005 with the Sudan Comprehensive Peace Agreement (SCPA). Its traumatic legacy lives on in the unending conflict and political dysfunction of South Sudan, which became an independent country under the terms of the SCPA.
For 30 years, Bashir led a military dictatorship bent on forcibly Islamicizing and Arabizing Sudan’s disparate tribes and religious groups. His regime carried out amputations, stonings, and other harsh punishments for such offenses as women wearing pants instead of skirts, the consumption of alcohol, adultery, homosexuality, and apostasy and blasphemy against Islam.

President Trump on Friday said that he is “giving strong considerations” to releasing immigrants detained at the border into sanctuary cities, one day after the administration insisted that the idea had already been considered and abandoned. ….The Radical Left always seems to have an Open Borders, Open Arms policy – so this should make them very happy!

The proposal was reportedly considered by the White House twice before, first in November as a caravan traveled north toward the border, and again in February as Democrats butted heads with Trump over funding for his long-promised border wall. It was said to have ultimately been rejected by DHS lawyers, who argued that it would violate the law. But after a purge of DHS leadership this week that Trump said was designed to make the department “tougher” on immigration, he abruptly changed course Friday, reviving the idea. "

I used to laugh every time I heard someone like Elon Musk say that we are living in a Matrix -like simulation. These days, not so much.
Don’t call the funny farm just yet. On the major question of the nature of sense experience, I remain with Aristotle and against Bishop Berkeley. Matter is real. But there is also the question of how we perceive “the news”; how established media institutions present and frame information; how we are supposed to respond to the “takes” purportedly expert and knowledgeable voices serve up to us by the second on social media. And here, I’m skeptical. Advertisement Advertisement
It’s hard not to be. Think of the headlines we’ve encountered since the beginning of this year. We were told the Covington Catholic boys were smug racist Trump supporters on the basis of a snippet of video. A young man, a private citizen, whose only offense was traveling to Washington, D.C., to march for life, was transformed at light speed into a symbol of hate and systemic oppression. However, just as Nick Sandmann’s reputation as a villain was about to set in stone, additional videos revealed that the students’ encounter with a far-left American Indian activist and the Black Hebrew Israelites was far more complicated than initially reported. The Covington Catholic boys had been smeared. People who cast themselves as agents of professional knowledge, expertise, and moral authority had circulated and amplified a lie in the service of a political agenda. Not for the first nor last time.
We were told Jussie Smollett, a rising gay African-American actor and singer, had been the victim of a hate crime committed by MAGA-hat-wearing Trump supporters in the dead cold of a Chicago night. Journalists and bloggers who asked questions about Smollett’s story were decried as bigots, even as key details went missing and the shifting timeline became more and more curious. Then the city’s African-American police commissioner announced Smollett had been arrested for orchestrating a bizarre hoax. The state’s attorney filed charges — charges subsequently dropped after behind-the-scenes lobbying by Michelle Obama’s former chief of staff. Advertisement
We were told that Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin were in cahoots to hack the emails of the Democratic National Committee and the Hillary Clinton campaign; that Trump might have been a Russian agent since the late 1980s; that the key to the conspiracy might be a server in Trump Tower relaying information to a Russian bank; that the indictment of Donald Trump Jr. was imminent; that Trump Sr., according to the former director of the Central Intelligence Agency, had committed “treason”; that Michael Cohen had met with Russian intelligence operatives in Prague; that Trump had directed Michael Flynn to speak to the Russians prior to Election Day 2016; that Trump had instructed Michael Cohen to lie to Congress; that Paul Manafort had met with Julian Assange in the Ecuadoran embassy in London during the campaign; that secret indictments in an Alexandria courthouse would be unsealed on the day Robert Mueller filed his report on possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. None of it happened. Advertisement
We were told that Michael Avenatti, a trial attorney who appeared seemingly out of nowhere to represent Stephanie Cliffords, a.k.a “Stormy Daniels,” in her (tossed-out) defamation suit against Donald Trump, was a defender of the rule of law and election integrity who posed, in the words of Stephen Colbert, an “existential threat” to the Trump presidency. Avenatti appeared incessantly on cable news, earning the equivalent of $175 million in media exposure between March and May 2018. Last September, an article in Politico Magazine carried the headline, “Michael Avenatti Is Winning the 2020 Democratic Primary.” When Avenatti said he represented a client who had been a victim of gang rapes and druggings at parties attended by Brett Kavanaugh during high school, NBC News interviewed the client despite being unable to verify her (ludicrous) accusation. By last November, when he was arrested for domestic assault in Los Angeles, Avenatti had appeared on television more than 200 times in the space of eight months. Advertisement
On the morning I wrote this column, a federal grand jury indicted Avenatti on 36 counts, including fraud. “Defendant AVENATTI would embezzle and misappropriate settlement proceeds to which he was not entitled,” reads just one sentence of the mind-boggling 61-page indictment. What media authorities had presented as true — that Avenatti was a serious attorney whose evidence would destroy the Trump presidency — has been revealed, once again, as utterly fallacious, a con. It’s up to the jury to decide if Michael Avenatti is a criminal. What’s beyond dispute, has been for a while, is that he is an unserious person, out for attention, celebrity, the notoriety and status fame brings. In the months of his ascendance, however, cable anchors and journalists did their best to avoid or downplay the truth of Avenatti’s character, lest it distract from their attack on the president’s.

National Gallery’s Tintoretto Show Falls Short | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Brian T. Allen,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/tintoretto-art-show-national-gallery/,"April 13, 2019 4:30 AM The Abduction of Helen , c. 1576/1577, by Jacopo Tintoretto. Oil on canvas. (Museo Nacional del Prado, Madrid © Museo Nacional del Prado) There are a few great works on offer, but most of his masterpieces didn’t make the trip.
I thought very carefully about how to review the National Gallery’s messy new Tintoretto show. I respect everyone involved and wrote two pieces about the show’s majestic incarnation in Venice earlier this year, mounted in honor of his 500th birthday. The show in Washington is the first Tintoretto retrospective in America. It’s really not a retrospective, though, unless we’ve invented a new genre of show called “retrospective lite.” Now, the Venice version? That was a real retrospective. The problem with the Washington? It doesn’t do justice to Tintoretto. Advertisement
What is a retrospective? Traditionally, it’s a big, lumbering thing assembling an artist’s best work over his entire career. It captures the artist’s spirit, depth, and genius and has almost all the seminal things and his best work. It is usually accompanied by new scholarship, but it’s also historiographical. How has the artist’s reputation evolved, and why are we fascinated by him now?
In one of my pieces on the Venice show, I questioned whether a truly satisfying Tintoretto retrospective could occur outside Venice and speculated that this might not be possible, though the National Gallery was the one to try. It has borrowing power and tons of money. After seeing the show in Washington, the answer is not only “they couldn’t” but also to note that what they might have been able to do, they didn’t. Advertisement
There are some core questions before a retrospective is undertaken. Is the art available? There are some artists — Michelangelo and Pinturicchio immediately spring to mind — whose iconic, seminal works are stationary. They might be tombs, and some of Michelangelo’s best work is funerary. You don’t discommode the dead willy-nilly. And don’t think about the Sistine Ceiling. It’s fresco, as are Pinturicchio’s cinematic library paintings in the Duomo in Siena. Architects, too, get the short end of the stick. Buildings don’t travel. The great park designer Frederic Law Olmsted’s 200th birthday is next year. He’s a great artist, but how do you do a show when the work is land, views, water, and flowers?
You can do shows on aspects of these artists, like the Met’s splendid show on Michelangelo’s drawings. You call this show a “drawings retrospective.” That’s fine. It was a great retrospective, with close to 300 drawings and covering all bases. Most very fine artists don’t deserve any kind of retrospective. They’ve had good decades or even only a few good years and then run out of gas or become hacks doing only what the art market wants. Andy Warhol, as we saw in the recent Whitney retrospective, was truly transformative only in the 1960s. The curator spilled gallons of ink and exposed us to some dreadful art in an effort to establish that the junk he did from his Chairman Mao in 1972 until he died in 1987 wasn’t junk. Curators doing retrospectives often get that giddy, that blinkered. Advertisement Advertisement
Retrospectives don’t need to be huge, but they need to be comprehensive, which is different from representative. I did a Mark Tobey retrospective with 90 objects. That was enough. I was involved in an Alfred Maurer retrospective, to my regret. The show was too big, and it merely established what a very spotty artist he was.
What do you do under any of these circumstances? You don’t do the retrospective. Or you focus on a narrower topic. Or you work on another artist. Advertisement
I don’t think a retrospective on Tintoretto could be done without work from the Scuola San Rocco, the Doge’s Palace, and his parish church (the church of the Madonna dell’Orto) — all in Venice. For many reasons, this work doesn’t travel, not that it physically can’t, but it’s not practical. San Rocco was his anchor commission, his Sistine Chapel, with dozens of paintings and an encyclopedic array of his quirks, tricks, and talents at their finest. I assume the masters at San Rocco look at each of the great ones as part of an indivisible whole.
To its credit, the National Gallery got two minor pictures from this cycle only because they’d just been cleaned and had been in conservation, thus gone, for a while. Their brushy, billboard quality merely makes us want to see more, and want to see the highlights of what is one of the great monuments of Western art.
The Doge’s Palace reception rooms have his big, late work. It’s not his best, and there were often hands other than his involved. At that point, Tintoretto had, through his grit and vision, built Tintoretto, Inc., both a workshop and a reputation as Venice’s high-end artist. This would not have been predicted given his disputatious persona, lone-wolf mentality, Titian’s subversion of his career, and competition from Veronese. These late things are the final fruits of his labor. They’re noisy, even frantic, and important. They’re also huge. They’d need a cargo plane to move and giant spaces for display. Madonna dell’Orto contains Tintoretto’s three massive paintings of Moses, the Crucifixion, and the Presentation at the Temple. They cemented his fame. These, too, are enormous. Two are 50 feet tall.

The retrospective in Venice worked for reasons distinct to Venice and Italy. First, it was marketed as a Tintoretto extravaganza. It was assumed that serious people — and this is not merely a tiny fraction of people traveling to Venice — would also get to one, two, or all three of these outlying places. The staterooms of the Doge’s Palace with their in situ Tintorettos were just steps away from the show. Many of the visitors who saw the show were Italians and from Venice or the Veneto. Yes, there are still Italians who live in Venice, and Venice has suburbs on the mainland. The extravaganza was for them, too, and it’s easy for them to cover the spots over time.
Tintoretto’s birthday extravaganza, at least the traveling-loan part of it, was actually at two separate museums. The early work was displayed at the Accademia across town. It was a big, serious show that I thought was more coherent, satisfying, and beautifully displayed than the show of work from the 1550s onward at the Doge’s Palace. The Accademia show concluded with the big picture that made Tintoretto famous, The Miracle of the Slave , from 1548. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement
The Miracle of the Slave is a showstopper and shows the young Tintoretto as a master designer and choreographer. If there was any way to get it to Washington, it would have, maybe, redeemed this iffy enterprise. The director of the Accademia just retired, but she is a worldly person and so might have allowed it. If it couldn’t get out of the Accademia building, and this is a possibility, then that is a serious reason not to do the show, unless you could have pried things from San Rocco, the Orto church, or the Doge’s Palace.
Second, the extravaganza worked in Venice because it’s Italy. I have seen few important museum shows in Italy that are installed with the same standards as in American or British museums. There’s always some incongruous, even bizarre feature. We expect that and edit it out. Sometimes it’s bad lightening, sometimes it’s weird spaces, sometimes surly or snoring guards, and often it’s haphazard interpretation. Advertisement
You expect, as in the case of Tintoretto, to see a retrospective in two separate museums. You expect to wander to three other places in Venice to see lots of major Tintorettos and a dozen other churches if you’re really committed to see individual altarpieces. The Venice retrospective succeeded because, in terms of marketing and how the curators arranged the shows there, visitors were almost commanded to go the extra mile, literally. Italians expect you to absorb things by osmosis, slowly, in bits and pieces. In Washington, you don’t, can’t, and shouldn’t. You have to do it in one place, with the best work, or don’t do it at all.
There is a self-inflicted, design problem, too. Elsewhere in the National Gallery, tucked away as if by stealth, is a version of the lovely Tintoretto drawings show that I saw at the Morgan Library last year. I found it totally by accident. This drawings show is not well publicized in the main Tintoretto galleries. Why was this show not simply integrated into the Tintoretto show? The only reason I can think for this is that the drawings show, done by another curator at another museum, undercuts one of the big Tintoretto show’s central themes. The big show makes much of Tintoretto’s spontaneity. The Morgan Library’s drawings show tells a story of an exacting, painstaking planner who thought long and hard about design and composition and didn’t simply paint whatever came into his head at a given moment.
Could the shows have been combined? Possibly. Should they have been separated, with one show in the proverbial “undisclosed location?” Of course not. If space was the big issue, my suggestion would have been either to find bigger space, do only the drawings show, or to do nothing but call FTD and send Tintoretto a birthday bouquet.
Some of the borrowed splendors in the Venice shows weren’t in Washington. Susanna and the Elders , surely one of the most gorgeous nudes ever painted, wasn’t there. We know it could travel because it made it to Venice from Vienna. The selection of portraits in the show — Tintoretto’s portraits are almost all owned by public collections — is good. Where was Christ Among the Doctors ? It’s big, early, splendid, from the Duomo’s museum in Milan, and was cleaned just before the Accademia show. It made it to Venice. It has the whiff of juvenilia, but it’s still brilliant, with the very young Tintoretto experimenting with ideas he would soon perfect. Why is St. Martial in Glory from 1549 displayed separately, in a room a football field’s distance from the show, in a separate space? It’s a fine, very big picture, and there are things in the Tintoretto show that are bigger, so it wasn’t a question of low ceilings.
There are great things in the Washington show, to be sure. The portraits are strong, but, for Tintoretto, portraiture was a sideline. The Abduction of Helen from the Prado is there, and it’s fabulous. The Origin of the Milky Way , The Nine Muses , and Tarquin and Lucretia are three great nudes, and while they’re luscious, they make points that have recently been made for American audiences in the MFA Boston’s 2009 show on Tintoretto, Veronese, and Titian.

(© RMN-Grand Palais / Art Resource, NY, Jean Gilles-Berizzi)
The Tintoretto show’s interpretation, graphics, lighting, and wall colors are perfect. The catalogue by Frederick Ilchman and Robert Echols is fine. It covers lots of old ground beautifully, with a new twist or two. It’s an important book. The separate catalogue for the Tintoretto show held at the Accademia was published only in Italian. The National Gallery could have done something meaningful and produced an English-language version of this very good book.
I think the justification of “well, there are some nice Tintorettos in the show” goes only so far. The Prado did a big Tintoretto show ten years ago, with a fine catalogue. I’m not sure the catalogue by Ilchman and Echols adds much to the Tintoretto scholarship there or in the fantastic Boston show on Tintoretto, Titian, and Veronese, which was, after all, an Ilchman and Echols show, too.

Studying Classical Literature in Our Age of Technology | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Howard Butcher,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/classical-literature-study-homer-the-iliad-modern-technology/,"April 13, 2019 4:30 AM Achilles Removing Patroclus’ Body From the Battle , c. 1547, by Léon Davent. (Metropolitan Museum of Art) Is technology killing students’ ability to read classical literature?
C aprock Academy, an academically accelerated charter school in Grand Junction, Colo., has the generous policy of giving every student in literature classes new copies of every text studied. (In neighboring public schools, the books are typically loaned to students and must be returned unmarked.) The intent is that Caprock students, many of whom could not otherwise afford to buy the books, begin to build their own personal libraries of great literature and become lifelong readers. The policy also enables students to annotate the texts. Advertisement Advertisement
Many students cherish the books and take good care of them, but some do not. In the spring, on the last day of school, one can walk down the hall and find discarded texts on the floor by the lockers and crammed in the big trash cans at the end of the hallways. The books are tossed amongst the flotsam and jetsam students have emptied out of their lockers in preparation for summer break. Some have broken spines and torn pages. Other copies are almost in pristine condition. The high-school English teachers call these books “orphans,” and we rescue them from the trash. What is interesting, however, is which books get thrown out.
Caprock Academy offers a classical education, and students are given approximately six books a year in core literature classes. For example, freshmen read The Epic of Gilgamesh , Homer’s Iliad and Odyssey , Sophocles’ Three Theban Plays , Hesiod’s Theogony and Works and Days , and Aeschylus’ Oresteia . They also study Virgil’s Aeneid in Latin I. Advertisement
Although the evidence is anecdotal and fluctuates a bit year to year, certain books appear in the trash with greater regularity than others. Emerson’s Essays and Poems , Hesiod’s Theogony and Works and Days, Virgil’s Aeneid, Milton’s Paradise Lost, and Stowe’s Uncle Tom’s Cabin seem to get orphaned more than most — four to seven copies of each out of roughly 40 students per grade level. To be sure, Homer’s epic poems are thrown out as well, but not in the numbers one might expect. Many students like and keep their copies of The Iliad . This begets the questions how — and why — does Homer’s 3,000-year-old epic poem speak to Generation Z?
Today’s teenagers live in a technology-driven world that consumes many of them. Virtually every student has a smartphone, and many of them have Facebook pages, Snapchat or Instagram accounts, and a selfie obsession. Some students spend incredible hours playing on their XBox or PlayStation 4. I’ve overheard students bragging about how much time they devote to video games — one 17-year-old proudly calculated that he’d spent two years of his life playing one single game. Unsurprisingly, this student barely graduated from high school, despite being a conspicuously bright young man. How his parents couldn’t see that he was addicted to video games and intervene, I’ll never know. Advertisement Advertisement
My students and my children tell me horror stories about sexting, catfishing, and predators in chat rooms. When teenagers want to take a break from social media or video games, they can binge-watch Neflix, Amazon Prime, or YouTube or stream free porn 24/7. This kind of extraordinary distraction and endless, irresistible entertainment presents problems that are new in the history of human development. Technology has delivered a true kind of soma and many kids seem to be drowning in it.
The unfettered use of technology and social media by young children is a direct threat to a student’s ability to read and study in a sustained and thoughtful way. They are incredibly distracted by the ceaseless buzz of their phones. Even if they read well, technology has harmed many of them: shortened attention spans, a compulsion to overshare every trivial detail of their lives, an expectation that they be entertained at all times, and an exaggerated focus on themselves. All these problems become evident in the classroom and become obstacles teachers must overcome. Advertisement
The problem is best addressed and solved by responsible parents who are willing to take a hard line and limit or deny access to all the aforementioned starting at birth — until, at the very least, children have become proficient readers and enjoy books and physical activity. However, responsible parents are in short supply. One hears a lot about a crisis in education. An even bigger problem, based on my experience, is the crisis in parenting. Advertisement
In today’s environment, engaging students effectively often requires appealing to their self-interest. At the beginning of The Iliad , I ask the girls in the class: How would you feel if an army of men was fighting over you ? The girls’ responses differ quite a bit: Some like the idea, but most usually don’t want people to die fighting for them. Then, the next day, the boys are asked: Would you fight a war for a woman? The answers vary, but interestingly, there is often a bit more of a consensus: For the right woman, many would fight. The conversations usually initiate reasonably serious thought and students refine and amend their answers as the class discussion evolves. This approach allows them to imagine the conflict as if they were a character in the text and it becomes a little easier to draw them into the story. Advertisement Advertisement
There is no getting around the fact that to read and comprehend Homer, students must apply themselves for an extended period of time: The Iliad is 24 books long. They take quizzes and exams, do close readings of key passages, engage in Socratic discussions, and write a ten-page end-of-year paper on “The Role of the Hero in Society.” But there must be more than rigor in a teacher’s pedagogy if one wants to engage Generation Z and genuinely educate them.
Probably the most popular and in some ways effective way to engage students is to assign Iliad projects. The assignment generates enthusiasm for the text and deepens students’ understanding of the epic by allowing them to interpret it in a personal and hands-on way. They work as individuals or in groups and are free to choose the project — as long as it has legitimate academic merit. Some use their skill and talent with technology to make remarkably accurate movie adaptations of key scenes: to do this well, students must read and comprehend the text. Presentations have included dioramas of battle scenes, models of Greek ships, PowerPoint or Prezi presentations on the weapons of the Trojan War, the gods, diseases, and burial rites. One popular choice is making a replica of the famous shield Hephaestus, the god of fire, forges for Achilles.
One student, Brianne Pinson, made a stunning version of Achilles’ shield for my class and won first place in the local Altrusa Art Fair with her work. However, discussing Achilles’ shield and all it signifies usually takes a very sobering turn. When I recently asked my class: If you were to make the modern equivalent of Achilles’ shield, what images should be put on the front? It only took a few seconds before someone answered, “A smart phone right in the middle.” Then another student said, “Someone using a smart phone to film a person being beat up, not helping the victim, but making a video to post on YouTube.” The class grew uncharacteristically somber as students considered these remarks. Shield of Achilles by Brianne Pinson
What happens to Achilles while he’s withdrawn from the war is another moment that offers lessons that many students are open to learning. Away from the frenzy of battle, quietly in his tent, he has time for introspection. It is after this quiet time that he rejects the war and his culture, especially the pursuit of honor and glory (timê and kleos, in Greek). Achilles plans to sail home and live a longer but modest life of anonymity. For the students, this is an excellent moment for a Socratic discussion about the importance of unplugging from technology in order to be introspective, to follow the Greek admonition to know thyself, and also to discuss the value of questioning one’s culture — and rejecting it, if needed.
Every fall, Caprock Academy has a USO show to honor our armed forces. The names of every veteran or active-duty service member related to students, faculty, or the administration are projected onto the gym wall throughout the concert. Honoring the men and women who fight and protect the country enriches some students’ understanding of The Iliad. Many can recognize the poignancy of certain moments, like when Hector’s son bursts into tears when he sees his father, helmet on, about to return to war. The modern equivalent of this scene plays out locally at the Grand Junction regional airport when loved ones in uniform deploy and leave their families behind. Advertisement
This awareness makes it easier for students to appreciate the sacrifices military men and women make and also to understand what classical scholar Victor Davis Hanson calls “the tragic view of life.” It is a central premise in The Iliad . To wit , Zeus’s assessment of mankind in the Fagles translation: “There is nothing alive more agonized than man of all that breathe and crawl across the earth.” This leads to a discussion about whether Zeus is right about mankind and what is meant by the term “the human condition.” Students point to the cruelty of Internet trolls as evidence that Zeus is right. Advertisement
After Hector kills Patroclus, Achilles is so devastated by the loss that he does things that, as a Greek soldier, he would not normally do and that are outside the norms of the society: human sacrifices, defiling the corpse of Hector (which the gods preserve despite Achilles’ best efforts), and refusing to bury Patroclus until his ghost implores Achilles to do so. These events raise the question of whether extreme situations such as war have the ability to dehumanize and transform human beings — and then, if there is a need and a duty afterwards, for society to help heal and reassimilate warriors back into domestic life.
Next, we look to see if Homer addresses the idea of warriors rejoining civilian life and processing grief. King Priam risks his life and crosses enemy lines in the dead of night to beg Achilles for Hector’s body back. The vulnerable old man goes into the Greek camp and straight into the proverbial lion’s den — but is not eaten by the lion. I ask the class: Why not? What accounts for this moment of grace? Is there something about the old man that stirs Achilles’ heart? Perhaps King Priam’s courage and his overwhelming love for his son? Something about the bond between any father and his son? Or maybe it is the anguish and loss radiating off the great man.
Priam says, “I have endured what no man on earth has ever done before — I put to my lips the hands of the man who killed my son.” Achilles is shocked to see Priam and disarmed by his words. Homer describes his reaction: “Those words stirred within Achilles a deep desire to grieve for his own father. Taking the old man’s hand he gently moved him back. And overpowered by memory both men gave way to grief.” Achilles softens and weeps and breaks down. His enemy does the same. Both men have been devastated by what each side has done to the other.
After they share a meal, Achilles allows King Priam to leave with his son’s corpse so the proper burial rites can be observed. In the end, Achilles lets go of his rage. He shows decency and respect to the old king, and thus rejoins humanity.
By the end of the narrative, even Generation Z can sense some of the wisdom, terrible beauty, and sadness alive in Homer’s work, but I’d be lying if I didn’t write that many students find it anticlimactic. Where is the Trojan horse? When does Achilles get shot in the ankle? What about the sacking of Troy? Of course none of these events happen in The Iliad — just in Hollywood’s version. The true version ends beautifully and gracefully with Hector’s funeral and interment.
Very few high-school freshmen can grasp Homer’s depth or appreciate the scale and intricacy of his work. If the students are snorkelers looking at a beautiful reef in a tropical sea, their masks are fogged and the dazzling fish and ethereal world moves behind a curtain of mist. However, if one can bring them close enough to see a little bit of the reef clearly, then the hope is that one day they will return, older and wiser, with a clearer mask, and see the whole reef in its full majesty."

Cook, in dissent, points out, the constitutional provision, which was adopted in response to claims that the legislature did not have authority to legislate minimum wages, provides only that “[l]aws may be passed fixing and regulating the hours of labor, establishing a minimum wage, and providing for the comfort, health, safety, or general welfare of all employees.” Cook nicely summarizes the broader problem with judicial activism: “When judges declare governmental actions unconstitutional based upon a personal distaste for the policies adopted through the legislative process, we cease to be governed by democracy.” Ed Whelan is the President of the Ethics and Public Policy Center. @EdWhelan123 "
Bernie Sanders Warms Up to Getting Rich | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Rich Lowry,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/bernie-sanders-warms-up-to-getting-rich/,"Follow Rich Lowry on Twitter April 14, 2019 11:00 PM
Bernie Sanders is newly vocal defender of making a lot of money , now that it has emerged that he himself is a millionaire:
“I didn’t know that it was a crime to write a good book which turns out to be a bestseller,” Sanders said at a community meeting in Gary, Indiana. Comments
Since Sanders described himself as a millionaire earlier this week, he and his campaign have stressed that his policy platform, which is fiercely critical of “billionaires” and wealthy corporate interests, like private insurers and pharmaceutical companies, is unchanged. His Medicare for All push has been colored by relentless attacks on those industries.
“My view has always been that we need a progressive tax system which demands that the wealthiest people in this country finally start paying their fair share of taxes. If I make a lot of money, you make a lot of money, that is what I believe,” Sanders added, defiant and plainly frustrated by the line of questioning. “So again, I don’t apologize for writing a book that was number three on the New York Times best seller, translated into five or six languages, and that’s that.”"
College Degrees Certify Life Skills You Can Get Elsewhere | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,James Piereson,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/college-degrees-life-skills-apprenticeships/,"April 15, 2019 6:30 AM (Pixabay) A bachelor’s degree certifies a set of life skills you don’t really need college for.
W hen customers visit an Enterprise Rent-a-Car establishment for the first time, they are often pleasantly surprised to be waited on by a staff of young managers, typically in their 20s, well dressed, polite, and efficient. The situation is much in contrast to many operations that employ middle-aged managers and hire young people to work their way up doing routine tasks. At Enterprise, the youngsters actually run the show, and they do it very well. And it is not an accident. Enterprise adopted a policy several years ago of hiring young college graduates to staff their local rental agencies. It is a policy that is paying off both for the company and for the young employees, who quickly learn the ins and outs of managing an office. Advertisement Advertisement
Enterprise offers more entry-level jobs for college graduates than almost any other employer in the United States. Last year they hired 8,500 for their management-training program, 40 percent more than the next highest employer. But according to a recent cover story in the Chronicle of Higher Education , Enterprise does not concern itself with questions such as where its trainees went to college, what they majored in, or even how well they did when they were there. “We recognize that great talent can come from all types of institutions, all types of majors and backgrounds,” Marie Artim, Enterprise’s vice president for talent acquisition, explained.
As the Chronicle notes, “to the company, a college degree matters mostly because it suggests that a candidate has acquired the right mix of skills to succeed in an entry-level job — and to move up the ladder from there.” Instead, the company simply takes a bachelor’s degree to signify that applicants can engage in some degree of critical thinking, problem solving, and juggling different responsibilities at the same time. Advertisement
This is what economists such as Ohio University’s Richard Vedder and George Mason’s Bryan Caplan have been arguing for years: College degrees are simply a signifier — an easy way of telling an employer that you have a basic grasp of the English language, some rudimentary math skills, and the ability to show up on time in clean clothes. On those measures, is a graduate of the University of Michigan any different from a graduate of Michigan State or Northern Michigan University? Not really. Does a 3.8 GPA predict that you will do better or worse at managing a car-rental office than someone with a 2.8 GPA? Probably not. Does majoring in business predict that you will do a better job than an English major or a sociology major or a physics major? It’s unlikely.
The management at Enterprise are saying aloud what many employers know to be true. Bosses who require a college degree are taking advantage of a system that does the sorting for them. They understand that a bachelor’s degree is not really necessary for doing an entry-level job, and that whatever your educational background, you will require significant training to do well in that particular position. Advertisement Advertisement
Surely there are plenty of high-school graduates who are qualified to run the front desk at a car-rental office. But finding out who those people are is more time-consuming than just looking at a résumé and seeing a bachelor’s degree. Too bad it costs most kids tens of thousands of dollars — not to mention the opportunity cost of several years out of the workforce — to get that piece of paper.
There are easier and cheaper ways to sort people. High schools could do more to teach the basic responsibility and functioning skills that they used to. In an age of helicopter parenting, though, many employers would wonder whether it was really parents who were responsible for high-functioning high-school students.
But surely a one- or two-year apprenticeship in any number of fields after high school could show the same evidence of critical thinking and responsibility. Unfortunately, the federal government does not subsidize those paths the same way we subsidize college education through financial aid. Such apprenticeship programs generally require the employer to take on the risk. When a potential employee drops out of such a program, the cost is borne by the employer. When someone drops out of college, the cost is borne only by the student and the taxpayer. Advertisement"
‘Abortion Restrictions Don’t Work’: A Dubious Claim | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Kyle Blanchette,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/abortion-restrictions-dont-work-dubious-claim/,"April 15, 2019 6:30 AM Signs outside the Supreme Court during the March for Life rally, January 27, 2017. (Aaron O. Bernstein/Reuters) A comforting thought for moderate pro-choicers is not supported by the available data.
S ome pro-choice advocates argue that having an abortion is perfectly morally acceptable, either because a fetus has little to no moral significance, or because a woman’s right to bodily autonomy always prevails over whatever rights a fetus might have. Some even go so far as to celebrate the act of having an abortion as a manifestation of female empowerment — the ultimate middle finger to the patriarchy. They hold that any and all abortion restrictions would amount to a violation of female bodily autonomy. Advertisement Advertisement
But many pro-choice advocates, especially among the rank-and-file, have a more moderate view. They concede that abortion is (at least usually) morally wrong or bad, perhaps even seriously so — even if women are often not blameworthy for having them. And yet they still believe that abortion should be legal. I would venture to say that this is the most common pro-choice position.
Pro-lifers are often baffled by this combination of beliefs, but some moderate pro-choicers have an explanation at the ready: Abortion restrictions don’t work . Instead of lowering the rate of abortion, they simply replace safe abortions with roughly the same number of unsafe “back alley” abortions. If a law does not reduce the incidence of the problematic behavior that it targets, and it also has costs attached to it — such as creating unsafe conditions for women seeking the procedure, or imposing unfair burdens on women in a society that often treats them unjustly — then that law is unjustified, even if abortion is morally wrong or bad.
The logic of this argument is above reproach. But the factual assertion at its heart — that abortion restrictions don’t work — does not stand up to scrutiny. Advertisement
In order to shore up this causal claim, pro-choice advocates typically rely on large-scale studies, such as a widely reported 2016 piece of research published in the Lancet , that report no correlation — and sometimes even an inverse correlation — between abortion restrictions and the rate of abortion across regions with stricter and looser abortion laws. For a concrete example of such an argument, we need go no further than the Guttmacher Institute, whose research scientist was the lead author of the Lancet study. An oft-referenced infographic on their website summarizes the relevant findings of the study as follows: “Highly restrictive laws do not eliminate abortion. Rather, they make the abortions that do occur more likely to be unsafe.” The graphic shows that the average rate of abortion in countries with strict abortion laws is comparable to the average rate of abortion in countries in which abortion is broadly legal. Advertisement
The key problem with using these estimates as evidence that abortion restrictions don’t affect abortion rates is that they do not account for confounding factors — i.e., they ignore the fact that countries with stricter abortion laws are also different in other ways that may affect abortion rates, a problem that the published study explicitly notes. While the report indeed finds that “abortion rates are not substantially different across groups of countries classified according to the grounds under which abortion is legally allowed,” it goes on to state that “the level of unmet need for contraception is higher in countries with the most restrictive abortion laws than in countries with the most liberal laws, and this contributes to the incidence of abortion in countries with restrictive laws.” Moreover, the vast majority of countries with more restrictive abortion laws are in developing regions, and poverty likely also has an impact on the abortion rates in these countries. Advertisement
It is not at all implausible that the abortion restrictions in these countries do, in fact, prevent many abortions from occurring, and that these countervailing factors act to bring their abortion rates in line with those of wealthier countries that have more liberal abortion laws. Indeed, when studies use rigorous methods to limit the problem of confounding factors, the evidence points in the opposite direction. Advertisement"
Holy Week Transcends Selfie Culture | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Kathryn Jean Lopez,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/holy-week-transcends-selfie-culture/,"Follow Kathryn Jean Lopez on Twitter April 15, 2019 6:30 AM Pope Francis holds palm branches as he leads the Palm Sunday Mass in Saint Peter’s Square, April 14, 2019. (Remo Casilli/Reuters) Martyrdom has its attractions.
Rome — On the way to Mass on the Friday before Good Friday, I passed the Roman Colosseum. It’s hard to have things put in better perspective. Christians were once fed to the lions there, and now it’s the background to many a tourist selfie. Mass that morning was at the Basilica of Santo Stefano Rotondo al Monte Celi. TripAdvisor’s top “review” on it that same morning offered this description: “Slightly off the beaten track, Santo Stefano is a lovely, quiet church full of horror.” The “horror” no doubt refers to the frescoes of Christian martyrdom that line the ancient circular basilica. Does it become less horrific when you see the serene smiles if not outright joy on some of the faces as these people approach their end? It depends on whether you believe that the martyr is in for a new beginning.
Santo Stefano is a Station Church for the Fifth Week of Lent, part of a tradition that dates back to the fourth century for the penitential season. Though, I confess, when you don’t walk the whole path as the Millennial seminarians at the Pontifical North American College do, but take a taxi, it’s also a tremendous way to visit some of the churches of Rome — and before the tourists are awake. It’s a way to drink in the breadth and depth of the martyrs, remembering the import of faith — what that faith may call for, if one truly believes and truly is tested. If we are really paying attention, it is a reminder that testing takes many forms.
I’m in the Eternal City for friendship, fellowship, prayer, and what research and reporting that can be had. While I’m over here, the pope emeritus, Benedict XVI, has had some thoughts published on the origins of and solutions for the sex scandals in the Church. It makes a whole lot of sense that he would, given his lifetime of service and deep wells of wisdom. His comments are subject to all kinds of controversy and spin. But the most important line is this: “Only obedience and love for our Lord Jesus Christ can point the way.” That seemed the most appropriate line to highlight as we are set to mark the holiest season on the Christian calendar yet again. He also writes:
There are values which must never be abandoned for a greater value and even surpass the preservation of physical life. There is martyrdom. God is (about) more than mere physical survival. A life that would be bought by the denial of God, a life that is based on a final lie, is a non-life.
He notes that “martyrdom is a basic category of Christian existence.” So it would follow that “the very essence of Christianity is at stake here” if martyrdom is not a part of our lives. Of course, martyrs exist in the world today. A priest killed while celebrating Mass in France comes to mind. As do Coptic Christians and Iraqi Christians slaughtered by the so-called Islamic State.
He explains the importance of “the authority of the Church in matters of morality”: “Those who deny the Church a final teaching competence in this area force her to remain silent precisely where the boundary between truth and lies is at stake.”"

House speaker Nancy Pelosi dismissed the progressive faction of her caucus led by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez as “like five people.”
In a 60 Minutes interview that aired Sunday, Pelosi was asked whether she could unify the “self-described socialists” and the “moderates” among House Democrats.
“By and large, whatever orientation they came to Congress with, they know that we have to hold the center. That we have to go down the mainstream,” she responded.
“But it doesn’t look like that. It looks as if it’s fractured. You have these wings– AOC, and her group on one side,” interviewer Lesley Stahl continued.
“That’s like five people,” Pelosi replied.
“The progressive group is more than five,” Stahl said. Stay Updated with NR Daily

“I’m a progressive,” Pelosi said.
Pelosi, 79, and Ocasio-Cortez, 29, have not clashed openly but have occasionally thrown shade at each other since the latter’s ascension to Congress earlier this year. In February, the speaker dismissed Ocasio-Cortez’s signature proposal, the Green New Deal, as the “green dream, or whatever they call it.” She also referenced the freshman congresswoman’s huge social-media following earlier this month during a discussion about the importance of being unified and working with the other side of the aisle."

Making the click-through worthwhile: Rising star Pete Buttigieg formally announces his 2020 presidential campaign, Democrats spend the weekend insisting that criticism is the same thing as inciting violence, and another conservative speaker is assaulted on a college campus.
The Mayor Is Having More than a Moment
On Sunday afternoon in South Bend, Ind., Pete Buttigieg formally announced his intention to run for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. Standing on a stage in front of thousands, packed inside a former Studebaker assembly plant, the mayor claimed that he’s the best alternative to what’s going on in the nation’s capital. Advertisement Advertisement
“The horror show in Washington is mesmerizing. It’s all-consuming,” Buttigieg said in remarks he wrote himself. “But starting today, we’re going to change the channel.”
The pundit class has been chattering for weeks about the 37-year-old South Bend mayor who is “having a moment.” But how long does a moment have to last before it becomes something more? The Buttigieg rise answers our question. Over the last few months, he’s been the subject of profiles in New York magazine , the Washington Post , and The Cut , among many others (along with some less favorable coverage such as this lengthy, scathing critique in Current Affairs , which arguably indicates he’s a real threat to those who would prefer to see the nomination go to Bernie Sanders). Advertisement
For now, he’s occupying the lane that supporters of Beto O’Rourke hoped the failed Senate candidate would have all to himself. The former Texas congressman outraised Buttigieg in the first quarter, but not by much: He’s raked in about $9.4 million, while the mayor boasted $7 million. Their average donation sizes were comparable, though Buttigieg’s was a bit lower at $36.35 compared to O’Rourke’s $43. Advertisement
The Buttigieg campaign’s choice of the former Studebaker plant for his announcement says a lot about their strategy. The plant has been closed for decades, and it stands as a symbol of the economic downturn from which South Bend has never recovered. But today the plant is also the site of new data and education initiatives that Buttigieg has pushed as mayor in an effort to revitalize the city.
Unfortunately for citizens of South Bend, his revitalization efforts haven’t really worked. But the mayor clearly intends to continue portraying himself as a young, competent technocrat who can appeal to many of the same working-class voters — devastated by the loss of Studebaker equivalents across the Midwest — who turned to Donald Trump for hope in 2016. Advertisement
Judging from his policy proposals, Buttigieg is just one more flavor of progressive among several already on offer from this election cycle’s Democratic party. But he seems to understand that Trump had real appeal to real people for reasons other than racism, and in this Democratic field, that makes him something of a stand-out. Advertisement
Ilhan Omar vs. Donald Trump Stay Updated with NR Daily
NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.
The freshman Democratic congresswoman from Minnesota is once again under the microscope, this time after remarks she delivered at a Council on American-Islamic Relations event last month. Omar said that after the terrorist attacks on 9/11, she had faced anti-Muslim attacks and “lived with the discomfort of being a second-class citizen.”
“Frankly, I’m tired of it, and every single Muslim in this country should be tired of it,” Omar said. “CAIR was founded after 9/11 because they recognized that some people did something and that all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties.” Leaving aside the fact that CAIR was in fact founded in 1994, not in response to the 9/11 attacks, some have criticized Omar for her use of the flippant phrase “some people did something” to refer to an act of terrorism that took the lives of thousands of Americans.
This wasn’t the first time Omar has faced conservative ire; she has repeatedly trafficked in anti-Semitic slurs for which she has refused to apologize, and for which the Democratic party has yet to hold her accountable. Clearly sensing an opportunity to renew his rivalry with the young progressive congresswoman, President Trump tweeted a video featuring Omar’s remarks interspersed with footage of the burning World Trade Center towers and other images from 9/11.
Now, Omar claims the president’s tweet has put her in danger. “Since the president’s tweet Friday evening, I have experienced an increase in direct threats on my life—many directly referencing or replying to the president’s video,” she wrote in a statement late Sunday night. More from Omar:
Violent crimes and other acts of hate by right-wing extremists and white nationalists are on the rise in this country and around the world. We can no longer ignore that they are being encouraged by the occupant of the highest office in the land. Counties that hosted a 2016 Trump rally saw a 226 percent increase in hate crimes in the months following the rally. And assaults increase when cities host Trump rallies. . . . This is endangering lives. It has to stop.
Many on the left, including several Democratic politicians and 2020 candidates spent the weekend insisting that right-wing criticism of Omar was directly putting her life in danger and “inciting violence” against her. “Inciting violence” is a highly specific legal category, and hardly any speech qualifies under that definition, so invoking it as a means of silencing Omar’s critics is nothing more than a hackneyed talking point.
These same commentators and elected officials had no qualms about Omar repeatedly spreading false accusations against the boys from Covington Catholic high school, and they rightly refrained from blaming Bernie Sanders for the Alexandria shooting in 2017, conducted by a former Sanders-campaign volunteer who targeted members of the congressional GOP citing his political beliefs.
The reaction to Omar’s comment at CAIR may have been a bit over the top, but the Democratic reaction to the criticism has been downright histrionic. Advertisement Advertisement
Violence on Campus
Unlike Congresswoman Omar, one conservative speaker has actually been subjected to assault in the last few days. Michael Knowles, a columnist for the Daily Wire , was assaulted late last week on the campus of the University of Missouri-Kansas City. Knowles was scheduled to give a talk entitled “Men Are Not Women,” hosted by the campus chapter of Young Americans for Freedom.
Protestors attended the talk and attempted to shout over Knowles’s remarks, holding signs that read “Trans rights are human rights,” “Respect my existence,” and “Trans men are men.” Finally, one protestor used a water gun to spray a “glitter-filled liquid” on Knowles, who tweeted immediately afterward that he initially thought it was bleach. Tests revealed it was “lavender oil and some other non-toxic household liquids.”
In response to the controversy, UMKC chancellor C. Mauli Agrawal released a statement affirming the First Amendment right to free speech, but not before he described Knowles as “a speaker whose professed opinions do not align with our commitment to diversity and inclusion and our goal of providing a welcoming environment to all people, particularly to our LGBT community.” Advertisement
I’m sure Democrats who spent the weekend accusing the president of bringing down violence on Omar’s head will be offering Knowles their support any day now . . . "

Warning. SPOILERS are ahead. If you don’t want to know anything about episode one of the final season of Game of Thrones , stop reading. Now.
Still reading? Good. Let’s get started in an unlikely place — church. A few weeks ago my pastor said during his sermon, “No one can control the consequences of sin.” One of the great deceptions of the enemy is the idea that you can get away with evil deeds, that you can manage your own compromises. You cannot. Advertisement Advertisement
The opening flashback scenes of the show took us back to a moment last season that I thought mainly stood on its own as a symbol of the war within Daenerys Targaryen’s soul — is she the ruthless daughter of the Mad King or is she the noble liberator who is going to “ break the wheel ” of oppression in Westeros? That moment was the brutal execution by dragon fire of Randyll and Dickon Tarly when they refused to bend the knee after their defeat in battle. Rather than imprison them, she give in to her worst instincts and roasted them.
Well those moral chickens came home to roost when she met Samwell Tarly, Jon Snow’s faithful friend and the man who helped discover Jon’s true lineage. She met him to thank him for saving Jorah Mormont, and she ended up disclosing one of her worst crimes. Samwell’s father was cruel to him, but he loved his brother. John Bradley plays Samwell, and he did an outstanding job conveying the change in emotions, from acceptance at his father’s death to true grief and anger at his brother’s execution. Advertisement
That moment meant that the disclosure of Snow’s true identity — as a Targaryen and the true heir to the Iron Throne — happened when Samwell was distraught, when he could plant seeds of doubt in Jon about Dany’s true character. Samwell put the question to Jon plainly. “You gave up the crown to save your people. Would she do the same?” Advertisement
And thus we saw the questions in Jon’s heart. He is the show’s honorable man — honorable sometimes to the point of foolishness. Daenerys is the show’s conflicted hero, torn between her quest for vengeance and her desire for justice. It was a masterful moment, and it illustrated that one moment in time — Daenerys’s impulsive decision to burn her honorable opponents rather than imprison them — could have consequences that turn the course of history. She did a terrible thing, and she can’t control what happens next.
The other key conflict in the first episode was between Sansa and Daenerys. Sansa’s character arc is one of the more fascinating of the series. She’s journeyed from starry-eyed young princess to perhaps one of the coldest and most shrewd characters on the show. She is every bit Daenerys’s intellectual and strategic equal, and despite Dany’s dragons, she is not intimidated in Dany’s presence. Advertisement
Finally, the first episode demonstrated the qualities that have made Game of Thrones a cultural sensation. It gets the big and the small things right. The opening scene capture the awesome might of Dany’s army, but it also captured the significant changes in her expression when her dragons shocked and awed the people of the north. Her slight smile when the people screamed in terror showed that Dany is perhaps just a bit too much in love with her own power. At the same time, the brief second between Sansa’s shock at the sight of the dragon and her obvious grim determination showed that she is and will be a match for Daenerys in the episodes to come.

Tax Cuts & Democrats -- Public Skepticism of Tax Cuts Is Normal | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Ramesh Ponnuru,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/public-skepticism-of-tax-cuts-is-normal/,"Follow Ramesh Ponnuru 12:44 PM
The Times article that Robert VerBruggen highlights below suggests that Democrats have been successful in misinforming the public about how many Americans have gotten a tax cut from the Republicans. But it’s probably not just political spin, or the design of that tax law, that caused people to underestimate the extent of the tax cut. Previous tax cuts have landed the same way. President George W. Bush, in his first term, passed two tax cuts that cut tax bills for everyone who paid income tax and raised taxes on nobody. In 2004, a New York Times /CBS News poll found that fewer than one in five Americans thought they had gotten a tax cut. Polls from the 1980s found that Americans were much more likely to think that the bipartisan tax reform of 1986, which in general reduced income taxes and raised corporate taxes, had raised their tax bills than lowered them.

Editor’s Note : This piece was first published in 2017 .
S ometimes my job sends me on flights. Sometimes the need to call on far-off family sends me on them. And often now they are smaller planes, from a regional airport. Some travelers don’t do as well with small planes. They react to the slightest bump or dip of turbulence with little yelps and moans. Some people giggle at them. And they giggle at themselves. But when those yelps and moans happen, I sometimes bring it to mind that the little dips and and jitters of a plane, the ones you want to discount with a giggle, would also be the first sign of real peril. So when the yelping comes from some passenger, I try to recall when I gave my last confession and say a prayer. Advertisement Advertisement
I do this because I’m haunted by the story of the crash of Air France Flight 447 in 2009. The plane disappeared into the Atlantic. At first most people thought it was a bomb, an act of terrorism. But years later, when the bodies and the black box were retrieved, the real story came out. I remember reading five or six accounts about how it happened. The plane hit a column of ice crystals in the sky. The autopilot mode shut off and the alarms started going crazy. The air-speed sensors were malfunctioning. All the pilots had to do was hold the plane steady. In one minute or so, the problems caused by the ice column would have cleared themselves up and the alarms would have ceased.
But the pilots responded by pulling the nose up. Already at a high altitude, the plane, predictably, went into a stall. Pulling the nose up meant losing lift, and the plane began to fall like a rock. A rock pointed upward. The pilots needed to push the nose of the plane down, and dive, to achieve lift again. They kept pulling up and the harder they did, the faster they fell. Advertisement
Years later, when the tapes of the pilots were released, and the true cause of the crash became known, all the great world tabloids — the Daily Mail , the New York Post — ran headlines of the final words of the pilot, blanked out: “F***, We’re dead!” Advertisement
Back to that in a minute.
One hundred and thirteen years ago, Marcel Proust wrote an essay in Le Figaro titled “La Mort des cathédrals.” A couple of years ago, near the beginning of a year of terror attacks in France, a popular Catholic blo g translated it into English. Proust was responding to a piece of anti-clerical legislation. He asked readers to imagine a future, centuries hence, in which the Christian religion had vanished from France, but the Gothic cathedrals — monuments to French genius — were still standing and admired. He wrote:
Then suppose that one day scholars manage, on the basis of documentary evidence, to reconstitute the ceremonies that used to be celebrated in them, for which men had built them, which were their proper meaning and life, and without which they were now no more than a dead letter; and suppose that for one hour artists, beguiled by the dream of briefly giving back life to those great and now silent vessels, wished to restore the mysterious drama that once took place there amid chants and scents — in a word, that they were undertaking to do what the Félibres have done for ancient tragedies in the theatre of Orange.
He asked: “Is there any government with the slightest concern for France’s artistic past that would not liberally subsidize so magnificent an undertaking? “
Well, in 2017, the rites of the Catholic religion aren’t yet entirely unknown in France. But I recently discovered that, contrary to Proust, there are limits to state subsidy. The French state does own the Cathedral of Notre Dame, and knows it is a major draw for tourists to Paris. The government kicks in about 2 million euros a year for basic maintenance. But pieces of the cathedral have been falling off it for years. Major repairs haven’t been tried since Marcel Proust was a teenager. The archbishop of Paris is now seeking about 100 million euros to do the work that needs to be done. And this fund-raising campaign is aimed partly at American s . Advertisement
I giggled at the solicitation for funds. Maybe the archbishop read one of those misleading Pew surveys that tout how “religious” America is compared with Europe. Maybe Americans are suckers for this kind of pitch: By contributing to the campaign to save Notre Dame, they’ve put an imaginary down payment on that long-dreamed-of trip to Paris. Advertisement Advertisement
There is a lot of gloom about Europe lately. A large Islamist terror cell tried to blow up the cathedral in Barcelona a few weeks ago, an as yet uncompleted modern masterpiece. Douglas Murray’s haunting and elegiac book The Strange Death of Europe dwells on how Europe lost its faith in Christ, and then lost faith in all the substitutes for Christianity: Fascism, Communism, human rights next, probably. Murray is not quite a believer, but he writes, “I cannot help feeling that much of the future of Europe will be decided on what our attitude is towards the church buildings and other great cultural buildings of our heritage standing in our midst.”
So what is the attitude to Notre Dame? Though the French state is its owner, it will not spend the money for necessary repairs. The local archbishop does not believe that he can raise the funds to keep this astounding testament to French history and genius locally, from the descendants of those who built it. Advertisement"

Former Massachusetts governor Bill Weld announced Monday that he will mount a Republican primary challenge against incumbent Donald Trump.
Weld, who served as governor of the Bay State from 1991 to 1997, announced earlier this year that he’d formed an exploratory committee for a possible presidential run but waited until Monday to make his candidacy official in a statement.
“Ours is a nation built on courage, resilience, and independence. In these times of great political strife, when both major parties are entrenched in their ‘win at all cost’ battles, the voices of the American people are being ignored and our nation is suffering,” Weld said in the statement. “It is time for patriotic men and women across our great nation to stand and plant a flag. It is time to return to the principles of Lincoln – equality, dignity, and opportunity for all. There is no greater cause on earth than to preserve what truly makes America great. I am ready to lead that fight.”
Prior to his two terms as the state’s governor, Weld was appointed to serve as the U.S. attorney for Massachusetts by President Ronald Reagan in 1981. Stay Updated with NR Daily

In a video posted to his campaign website, Weld claimed credit for helping to revitalize the Massachusetts economy by disrupting decades of unified Democratic control, cutting taxes and cracking down on crime. He juxtaposed his record as U.S. attorney and governor with that of President Trump, whose character he impugned through a montage of crass statements Trump made during and prior to the 2016 presidential campaign."

For 800 years the people of France gave the world a great gift. For 800 years countless millions experienced its transcendent beauty. Then, in an afternoon, it was gone — gutted by fire. We watched it burn, and across the whole of Christendom men and women were surprised by the extent of their grief. Advertisement Advertisement
In the days and weeks that follows, people will share their stories about Notre Dame. Here’s mine. On March 9, 1996, I walked into the great cathedral on the morning of my wedding day. The gravity of the moment was starting to sink in, and I wanted a place to pray. We Protestants are accustomed to thinking of the great cathedrals of Europe mainly as tourist attractions — as beautiful historical buildings and not as actual, living churches. That morning changed my heart.
It was too early for most tourists to arrive, so I walked past other worshipers, men and women on their knees before the Lord. I knelt also. I asked God’s blessing on my wedding, on my marriage, and on the children we hoped to have. In that moment, I felt the presence of God, but I also felt something else — for a moment I was staggered at the thought of the sheer number of people who’d knelt in this same spot and asked God for these same good things. I felt more connected to the larger body of Christ than I’d ever felt before. Stay Updated with NR Daily
NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.
The Notre Dame I visited wasn’t just a beautiful building. It wasn’t just a marvel of medieval architecture. And it wasn’t just the center of the French nation — the place where kings and emperors were crowned. It was a symbol of an enduring church and God’s enduring presence. France will feel its loss more than it now understands. We all will. Advertisement"
Ilhan Omar: Criticism an Attack on Muslims | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Kevin D. Williamson,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/ilhan-omar-comments-criticism/,"About Kevin D. Williamson April 16, 2019 6:30 AM Rep. Ilhan Omar speaks about Trump administration policies towards Muslim immigrants outside the Capitol building in Washington, D.C., April 10, 2019. (Jim Bourg/Reuters) When the ‘victim’ is the victimizer
‘I t has to stop,” says Representative Ilhan Omar.
No, it does not.
Representative Omar, the Jew-hating Minnesota Democrat, is engaged in one of her usual games of misdirection, a pattern of hers that by now is familiar enough to be predicted: She says something outrageously stupid, offensive, anti-Semitic — or all three at once — and then attempts to parry the thrust of inevitable criticism by characterizing it as an attack on Muslims, women, women of color, Muslim women of color, etc. Advertisement Advertisement
In this case, Representative Omar characterized the events of September 11, 2001, this way: “Some people did something.” Someone assembled a video intercutting her blasé account of mass murder with images of that day’s events, and Donald Trump, who serves simultaneously as president of the United States and the nation’s social-media intern, tweeted the video, along with some vintage all-caps emoting: “WE WILL NEVER FORGET!”
The New York Times stepped on Representative Omar’s cue and uttered her lines itself, insisting that the criticism of Representative Omar is necessarily part of an attack on Muslims categorically. Trump of course has on more than one occasion treated Muslims categorically, for instance in calling for “a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States,” which, like so many of President Trump’s blustery promises, never came to pass and never even was given serious consideration. (The actual policy consists of restrictions on travel from six predominantly Muslim countries, along with North Koreans and officials of the Venezuelan government.) Representative Omar is not all Muslims, and she is not Muslims categorically: She’s a loopy left-wing identity-politics entrepreneur whom the Democratic party has carried to the U.S. House of Representatives. Criticism of elected officials is not only permissible but necessary. Advertisement
But Representative Omar believes she is above such criticism: “It has to stop,” she said, citing death threats she has received since the presidential tweet. That argument is pure horsepucky. It is an unfortunate fact of life in Anno Domini 2019 that practically everyone in public life receives death threats, often on social media or in online forums. Elected officials do. Journalists and commentators do. Entertainment figures do. I do, and my colleagues do. That’s our dumb world. And, currently, it’s part of the price for certain kinds of careers. There isn’t anything special about Representative Omar in this regard. She’d get death threats if she were a Fox News host, too. Advertisement
But such threats are a useful pretext for politicians who want to shut down criticism for their own narrow political ends. Senator Bernie Sanders, the socialist rape-fantasy entrepreneur from Brooklyn who represents Vermont in the Senate, insisted that criticism (he wrote “attacks”) simply “must end.” Senator Elizabeth Warren, the fake Indian from Oklahoma who represents Massachusetts in the Senate, accused the president of attempting to “incite violence.”
The Democrats are in a political pickle. They would very much prefer that the Jew-hating caucus shut up, and they are not crazy about the fact that the public face of the Democratic party is, at the moment, risible and demented amateurs such as Representative Omar and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, i.e., the people who are even crazier than Senator Sanders. But intersectionality is a jealous god, and they cannot simply tell Representative Omar et al. to sit down and clam up. All they can really do is to try to raise the price of criticizing the nut cutlets on the Democrats’ menu by insisting that criticism of Representative Omar is an attack on Muslims as such, that criticism of Representative Ocasio-Cortez is an attack on Latinas who don’t know how a bill becomes a law, that criticism of Robert Francis O’Rourke is an attack on . . . whatever it is that “Beto” is pretending to be this week. The New York Times et al. are reliable allies on that front. Advertisement Advertisement
This is, incidentally, what all those fake hate crimes are really about: Redefining criticism of Democratic politicians and constituencies as violence . When there isn’t enough violence to make that case in a sufficiently dramatic fashion, then violence can simply be invented — and, if the case of Jussie Smollett is anything to go by, the cost of doing so is pretty low. When’s the last time you heard of a prosecutor dropping a 16-felony indictment in exchange for a firm handshake? Advertisement
That’s a neat trick, really: to be the hostage and the hostage-taker at the same time. Advertisement"
Notre Dame Cathedral Fire: Good Friday Comes Early for the Cathedral This Year | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Nicholas Frankovich,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/notre-dame-cathedral-fire-good-friday-hope/,"April 16, 2019 6:30 AM Smoke billows as fire engulfs the spire of Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris, France, April 15, 2019. (Benoit Tessier/Reuters) The loss is incalculable. So is the reason for hope that it will always point to.
April 15, 2019, the evening of Monday in Holy Week
N otre-Dame de Paris is burning. The cathedral’s spire has fallen. The roof has collapsed. Firefighters have been on the scene for hours. The fire won the fight. “There will be nothing left,” a spokesman for Notre Dame told the BBC. It’s almost that bad: The towers and façade will be spared, but much of the interior, including the famous carved woodwork that was the labor of generations, has gone up in the flames, like Elijah in his chariot, en route to heaven. Advertisement Advertisement
“The eldest daughter of the Church,” France’s title of endearment among Europe’s Catholics, has worn Notre Dame, the Cathedral of Our Lady, as its crown since the High Middle Ages. Over the centuries, its vaults, flying buttresses, gargoyles, and rose windows came to assume the status of ancient icons, symbols of Western Christian civilization. We sometimes forget what a breath of wild fresh air Gothic architecture must have been when it began to spring up here and there in northern Europe in the 12th century. The angular verticality pulled the eyes upward and the mind toward things of heaven, like a grove of towering oaks.
Ground for Notre Dame was broken in 1163. Twenty-six years later, the high altar was dedicated. The choir, the nave, and the main, western façade were completed by the middle of the following century. Chapels and various additions were gradually added, one by one. A great cathedral is never completed. After its first hundred, two hundred years, give or take a few, its frame has been established and its general demeanor has been settled, and succeeding generations of artists are afforded the luxury of homing in on delicate, carefully thought-out embellishments, icing on the wedding cake. Advertisement
Notre Dame has been the site of royal weddings and coronations, of papal Masses and of funeral Masses for heads of state. For the tourist, its beauty overshadows its function, which is to provide for the celebration of the Eucharist a house as worthy as mere mortals are capable of building. Immersed in its purpose, the pilgrim feels its magnificence all the more keenly. Theology and sacred history explained themselves through statues of saints and biblical figures: scripture for all who had eyes to see, including the unlettered. Much of that treasure was destroyed in the violence of Christian iconoclasm during the Protestant Reformation and then in the violence of the French Revolution, not to mention the intervening misguided renovations that included the removal of some medieval stained-glass windows. After a few subsequent restoration projects, one of which left the façade cleansed of longstanding grime so that the white stone underneath shone as it did in the cathedral’s youth, Notre Dame began to be itself again by the second half of the 20th century. Advertisement
No one knows what any one craftsman thought and felt as he chiseled, sculpted, laid stones, or otherwise contributed to this monument to God, by way of Mary, the mother of His Son, but from the result of their collective work we glimpse the size of the love that the people of Paris as a whole have had for their faith. They’ve poured a lot of human soul into that structure. Notre Dame echoes emotions etched deep into the marble of Saint Mary Major, that ancient jewel of a Roman basilica likewise dedicated to Our Lady — the same poem, sung in a different architectural language. Advertisement
Authorities say they haven’t determined the cause of the fire that broke out on the Île de la Cité at 6:30 this evening of Monday in Holy Week. Plots to destroy the cathedral have been foiled by law enforcement the past couple of years. Catholic churches across France have been hit by a spate of vandalism in recent months. In March, fire damaged the Church of Saint-Sulpice in the sixth arrondissement. Firefighters said it was arson; police are still investigating. We don’t know enough to say whether the fire at Notre Dame is the latest, most spectacular incident in some ongoing sinister plot against the Church in France, so we look for guidance to Our Lady of Prudence, charting a course between conspiracy-mindedness and naïveté. Advertisement Advertisement
The Church of the Holy Sepulchre — or of the Resurrection, as it’s known to the Eastern Orthodox — is by some accounts the holiest site for Christians of all persuasions and denominations. Erected on the site in Jerusalem where Jesus is reputed to have been crucified and buried and to have risen from the dead, Holy Sepulchre, almost twice as old as Notre Dame, has been destroyed by fire, rebuilt, destroyed by a caliph, and rebuilt again. Let French Catholics take courage from the precedent. The rest of us can figure out how to contribute to reconstruction efforts if we want to."
Elizabeth Warren's Corporate and Wealth Tax Proposals Misguided | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Jon Hartley,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/elizabeth-warren-corporate-wealth-tax-proposals-misguided/,"April 16, 2019 6:30 AM Sen. Elizabeth Warren speaks to reporters on Capitol Hill in 2017. (Aaron P. Bernstein/Reuters) The Massachusetts senator proposes to use some of the most economically damaging forms of taxation in a misguided attempt to help the poor.
T his week, Senator Elizabeth Warren’s 2020 presidential campaign unveiled a radical proposal to levy a minimum 7 percent corporate tax on U.S. companies making more than $100 million annually, with the goal of raising around $1 trillion in new revenue. This comes on the heels of Warren’s proposal to institute a new 2 percent wealth tax on all individual fortunes above $50 million and an additional 1 percent tax on all fortunes above $1 billion with the objective of reducing wealth inequality. Advertisement
Unfortunately, the higher corporate taxes and wealth taxes Senator Warren advocates are among the most inefficient ways of raising tax revenue without harming the economy.
Corporate taxes have been shown to be significantly less efficient in raising tax revenue than individual income taxes or sales taxes. The ease with which corporations can establish offshore subsidiaries to avoid taxes or engage in tax inversions significantly contributed to the corporate-tax-revenue and capital-investment shortfalls seen in America in recent years. Indeed, many European countries had already recognized the inefficiency of corporate taxation and reduced their corporate-tax rates well before the U.S. did so as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.
The significantly positive macroeconomic data reported for 2018, the first year that tax-reform package went into effect, includes 7 percent growth in non-residential fixed investment, 2 percent real-wage growth and 3 percent GDP growth. Academic research shows that this is no coincidence. Several studies of prior corporate-tax reforms have found that lower corporate-tax rates are associated with higher wage growth and higher rates of capital spending on buildings, property, and equipment. Advertisement
Senator Warren’s 7 percent minimum tax on corporate income would likely reverse these recent positive economic trends and lead to slower growth in investment and wages, in part because it would also disincentivize the automatic expensing of capital equipment. Lower wages, hiring, and investment means less government tax revenue. Advertisement
As for the new wealth taxes Warren proposes, the example of Europe is instructive there, too. Only three European countries (Norway, Spain, and Switzerland) still impose annual wealth taxes today, down from twelve in 1990. The change was fueled by a growing recognition that wealth taxes very often lead to capital flight as wealthy individuals re-domicile to lower-tax jurisdictions, taking their income-tax dollars with them. France’s now-abandoned wealth tax, for example, is estimated to have contributed to the departure of some 42,000 millionaires from the country between 2000 and 2012."
Notre Dame Cathedral Fire: An Omen for Europe | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Dennis Prager,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/notre-dame-cathedral-fire-omen-europe/,"Follow Dennis Prager on Twitter April 16, 2019 6:30 AM Sparks fill the air as Paris Fire brigade members spray water to extinguish flames as the Notre Dame Cathedral burns in Paris, France, April 15, 2019. (Philippe Wojazer/Reuters) Europe is burning, just as Notre Dame was.
T he symbolism of the burning of Notre-Dame Cathedral, the most renowned building in Western civilization, the iconic symbol of Western Christendom, is hard to miss.
It is as if God Himself wanted to warn us in the most unmistakable way that Western Christianity is burning — and with it, Western civilization. Advertisement Advertisement
Every major Western (and one major non-Western) social and intellectual force has conspired to rid Europe of Christianity and the civilization it produced.
Within the Western world, the French Enlightenment — the intellectual basis of the French Revolution and the modern West — sought to replace Christianity, and religion in general, with secularism rooted in reason. No God, Bible, or Ten Commandments are necessary for morality or meaning: Reason (and science) will replace them.
The two final deathblows to Christianity in Europe were the world wars. World War I ended most Westerners’ belief in the nation-state and the West. Christianity, already weakened by the Enlightenment, was further weakened by World War I. German Christians were killing millions of French and English Christians, and French and English Christians were killing millions of German Christians. So the argument and sentiment against Christianity went. Then World War II saw even more death on the Christian continent as well as the failure of Catholic and Protestant churches in Nazi Germany to offer even minimal noncompliance with the Nazis’ Jew-hatred. Advertisement
With the end of World War II, every internal Western intellectual doctrine was secular. God, the Bible, and religion were regarded at best as innocuous nonsense and at worst as noxious nonsense. Advertisement
Meanwhile, Europeans brought a non-European ideology into Europe, an ideology that, for more than a thousand years, sought to replace Christianity as the world’s dominant religion. The Europeans, believing in nothing distinctly Christian or Western, and believing in the moral and intellectual nonsense known as “multiculturalism”— a doctrine that asserts that all cultures are morally equivalent — saw nothing problematic in bringing millions of Muslims into Europe. In their ignorance and arrogance, they assumed that because they were secular multiculturalists, everybody else was, too — or would be, once they lived in Europe.
VIEW GALLERY: Fire at Notre Dame Cathedral Advertisement
They were wrong, of course. And as a result, the two dominant forces in Europe — secular leftism and Islamism — sought the end of Christianity and the West. (The Left believes that protecting Western civilization is equivalent to protecting white supremacy.)
This is not producing a pretty picture. Generally speaking, Islam has not been nearly as kind, tolerant, open, medically or scientifically innovative, or intellectually curious as Western civilization (and yes, Nazism and Communism were born in the West, but they were anti-Western).
Even without tens of millions of Muslims, post-Christian Europe has not produced a pretty picture. This was predicted in 1834, a hundred years before Hitler’s rise, by the great German poet Heinrich Heine, a secular Jew (who later converted to Protestantism, “the ticket of admission into European culture”):
Christianity — and that is its greatest merit — has somewhat mitigated that brutal German love of war, but it could not destroy it. Should that subduing talisman, the cross, be shattered, the frenzied madness of the ancient warriors, that insane Berserk rage of which Nordic bards have spoken and sung so often, will once more burst into flame. This talisman (the cross) is fragile, and the day will come when it will collapse miserably. Then . . . a play will be performed in Germany that will make the French Revolution look like an innocent idyll.
European Christians persecuted European Jews, often brutally. But it took a post-Christian ideology, secular Nazism, to produce Auschwitz — just as it took post-Christian Communism to produce the Gulag, the Chinese Cultural Revolution, and the Ukrainian and Cambodian genocides.
Moreover, Nazism and Communism aside, the Left’s belief that secular reason can replace God and the Bible turns out to be completely wrong. The alleged citadels of secular reason — the universities — are the most irrational and morally confused institutions in the West."
The Progressive Revolution: From Democratic to Liberal to Progressive to Socialist - National Review,www.nationalreview.com,,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/progressive-revolution-ends-in-socialism/,"April 16, 2019 6:30 AM President Barack Obama in 2016 (Jonathan Ernst/Reuters) Obama kick-started a cycle that moves ever farther left — even he now seems passé.
A mericans voted for Barack Obama in 2008 despite, not because of, his most partisan voting record in the Senate. They were once willing to look past his earlier dubious associations with abject anti-Semites such as the Reverend Jeremiah Wright, former terrorists like Bill Ayers, and unhinged characters such as Father Pfleger. They also averted their eyes from Obama’s often quite offensive commentary, in his autobiography and during the 2008 campaign (e.g., “typical white person” and “ they cling to…” speech). Advertisement Advertisement
Instead, voters were tired of the Iraq War (which was over for all practical purposes by the time of the November 2008 election).
They were, of course, terrified by the September 2008 financial meltdown (which had been mostly stabilized four months later by the time of the inauguration) and irate at the kid-gloves treatment accorded often conniving banks and investors.
They were convinced that Obama might be healing and transformative as the first African-American president, supposedly only slightly to the left of a far steadier and more qualified Condoleezza Rice or Colin Powell. And half the Democrats were already becoming sick of Hillary Clinton once they became reacquainted with her on the 2008 primary-campaign trail.
As is typical of American politics, voters in 2008 also wanted to change the party in power after it had been in the lead for eight years, and the lame-duck president fell out of favor. Voters certainly were underwhelmed by an uninspiring, herky-jerky, mostly incompetent John McCain campaign, notable for his “that’s not who we are” comments and his willingness to “lose nobly.” Advertisement Advertisement
Such was the naïve dream.
The reality by 2013 was that voters got an increasing hard-core liberal-progressive revolution that, after Obama’s 2012 reelection, increasingly polarized America over the reach of the federal government, immigration, and race. Scandals at the DOJ and IRS were often political in nature. By summer 2016, the Obama administration had weaponized the intelligence agencies and his own justice department to such a degree that unleashed bureaucrats and appointees actively sought to intervene in a presidential campaign to undermine the opposition candidate and to lay the foundation for sabotaging the incoming president’s transition and administration.
An overregulated economy stagnated, requiring ever more federal intervention and borrowing. Students on campuses lost constitutional protections, especially under the First and Fifth Amendments, as universities finalized their long transformation into indoctrination centers. Obama recalibrated American foreign policy in neutralist fashion, and in a way that made Egypt, Israel, and Saudi Arabia more suspect than Iran, Turkey, or Cuba. Advertisement
Culturally, diversity replaced affirmative action, on the principle that formerly documented grievances or class status no longer mattered, at least compared with skin color. The real divide was now between a non-white, far greater collective that harbored purported grievances against a reconstituted and much smaller white majority and its “privilege and “supremacy.” When feminists and gays were included in the diverse intersectional bloc of Asians, Latinos, blacks, and immigrants, a supposed new majority of “woke” Americans now would have electoral control over a culpable and soon to become irrelevant minority. The “content of our character” and all that became “inoperative.” Advertisement
All this was largely the legacy of an otherwise mostly unsuccessful Obama administration whose record was one of massive debt, an ossified economy, decreased sovereignty, increased ethnic and racial tensions, and a confused foreign policy perceived abroad as apologetic and contrite, and therefore useful to rivals and enemies. Advertisement
The Socialist-Progressive Takeover
Yet Obama had hit on something in his move to the hard left. After he left office, unapologetic leftists were less coy (the old smear of “socialist” was now a term of endearment) and began to extinguish what little was left of Bill Clinton’s old, occasionally moderate Democratic party.
The reelection of Obama had convinced progressives that he had discovered electoral magic: record voter registration, turnout, and block voting of “minorities” that could overcome the old Perot, Reagan Democrat, silent majority, and tea-party dinosaurs in the critical swing states. This chemistry, they thought, would be inherently transferrable even to multimillionaire white establishmentarians like Hillary Clinton or Joe Biden ( but only if they were reeducated and thus made the necessary confessionals about their own white privilege and shared disdain for “deplorables” and “the dregs of society”).
Suddenly, everything seemed possible as woke activists, à la French Revolution, accelerated the possible into the already passé. Advertisement Advertisement
In just a few years, mere acceptance (rather than endorsement) of gay marriage was veritable homophobia. Assimilation and integration were seen as tantamount to cultural appropriation and imperialism. Conservation and market-based encouragement of alternative energy were the appeasement of “climate deniers” and showed a cowardly reluctance to go the full green mile and eventually ban the internal combustion engine. The Kavanaugh hearing, the Covington-kids fiasco, and the Jussie Smollett farce made clear that the Left was no longer liberal but hard-left and fact-free.
Secure borders and deportation of illegal aliens who had committed crimes were themselves humanitarian “crimes.” Building the wall went to stopping the wall to promoting the tearing down of the wall. The notions of affirmation action and disparate impact became Sixties’ relics, when “reparation” was the real goal. Prior street-theater groups such as Occupy Wall Street and Black Lives Matter seemed timid anachronisms compared with Antifa and its masked hoodlums who torched and beat up anything in their path.
“Legal but rare” abortion became a sellout position, given that any woman had a right to partial-birth abortion and even infanticide if she so chose. A dream of a 50 percent income-tax rate on top incomes went to talk of 70 percent then to 90 percent and then to a wealth tax as just deserts. To enlarge the electorate, illegal aliens should vote first in local elections, but then why not everywhere? Sixteen-years olds could too, and so why not ex-felons as well? About a $1.5 trillion in student debt should be forgiven — but then tuition should be free for all (as should Medicare). Advertisement
The appearance and success of the polarizing Donald Trump supercharged the ongoing progressive revolution. The rallying cries of “collusion,” “treason,” and the new “Manchurian candidate” won over any holdout Democrat and seduced the emasculated Never Trump right into becoming useful colluding idiots. The 2018 Democratic midterm victory in the House was not seen in historical context: Trump in fact had fared much better in both the House and Senate in his first midterm than had either Bill Clinton or Barack Obama at that point in their presidencies, both of whom were easily reelected, while mostly centrist candidates had given the Democrats the new House majority.
By spring 2019, we were light years beyond the revolution’s beginning in summer 2008 — and heading into hard-socialist territory and beyond.
Indeed, the once edgy community-organizing Obama himself had become a tragicomical figure. He spent a bit of his post-presidency warning against a “circular firing squad” of Democratic cannibalism but otherwise was hell-bent on becoming worth $100 million in “I built that fashion”—and was never again heard uttering another “I do think at a certain point you’ve made enough money” sermon.
Socialism and Beyond
Conventional wisdom would warn Democrats that their surrender to pied pipers such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Rashida Tlaib, Al Sharpton, Linda Sasour, and other assorted fakers, con artists, anti-Semites, and street actors would lead them all over the proverbial George McGovern and Walter Mondale cliff into the abyss. But such caution is unlikely for a variety of reasons.
One, Democratic candidates now sound a lot more like Bernie Sanders than he ever sounded like them. The new socialists believe that they have altered the nature of the electorate and the manner in which elections are conducted, and that they will continue to do so at an accelerating pace.
Preemptory charges of “voter suppression” have made required prior registration and voter IDs veritable racist crimes, as voter harvesting and fluid same-day registration and voting are the hallmarks of the future, even as open borders change the demography of the nation. Youth, not experience or tenure, is the requisite for progressive revolution, as brontosauruses like Diane Feinstein and Chuck Schumer struggle to sputter a few shrill socialist platitudes to maintain minimal relevance. Anti-Semitism is not called out by Democrats, because party leaders fear that Ocasio-Cortez, Omar, and Tlaib are not aberrations but now represent 51 percent of the new Democratic party on both Israel and American Jewry.
Two, few leftist revolutionary cycles ever halt in mid course, whether in 1789 France, 1917 Russia, 1946 China, or 1960 Cuba. The philosophy is always that today’s radical is yesterday’s sell-out to be replaced by tomorrow’s genuine far harder leftist — until the limits of reality are reached and the movement either implodes or leads to an authoritarian Napoleon, Lenin, Mao, or Fidel.
The current socialist trajectory is divorced from reality, whether reality mean the critical role of fossil fuels in maintaining civilization, or the historical record of tribalism destroying nations from Rwanda to the Balkans, or the usual story of soft socialism inevitably turning hard and ending in the mass poverty of a North Korea, Venezuela, or Cuba. Advertisement
The End Game
Socialists and hard progressives believe that they already have won about three-fifths of America, defined not by population, polls, or political office, but by cultural clout. They assume that such control will inevitably end in final victory in the Congress and presidency, the same way that that there’s no longer a Republican party to speak of in California and not a single statewide officeholder who is not a Democrat. Seven of 53 House seats are Republican in the California of Ronald Reagan and Pete Wilson.
Entertainment and Hollywood are mostly all left-wing and missionary in their progressive zeal. The network news, PBS, NPR, CNN, and MSNBC outnumber talk radio and Fox News.
Most of the major newspapers are progressive. Silicon Valley is harder left still and more audacious in baking ideology into its products from Twitter and Facebook, which censor conservatives, to Google, with its progressive bias in formatting and searches.
The biggest foundations that most fund activists and academics are mostly left-wing. No one believes that the campuses are balanced or even disinterested. Most academics believe that they can be legitimately biased leftward to balance the supposed prejudices of the family, community, and church — noisome cargo that too many of their naïve students bring with them on arrival, which is why they need “cleansing” and “awakening.”
Sports events and reporting are liberal and increasingly avenues to peddle political messages. Corporate America tries to emulate popular culture and thus must adopt left-wing tropes, so it’s trigger-happy in its readiness to shoot down conservatives who are deemed hostile to our shared fated progressive future.
What we are seeing in the Democratic party’s movement to the hard left is not the beginning but the end of a long march. Socialists and progressives believe that control of the Congress, the presidency, and courts is the final missing tessera from their already expansive socialist mosaic."

FIRE has a rating system ( “ red light ” meaning significant interference with free speech, “ yellow light ” meaning some interference, and “ green light ” meaning that the school hardly interferes) for colleges and universities.

Popping in from vacation for a moment . . .
I’ve seen a gripe or two about social-media feeds filling up with people’s old vacation pictures of the Cathedral of Notre Dame. Don’t waste time grumbling; this is part of how people are grieving, trying to get their heads around what was lost, and coming to terms with the fact that the experience they thought that be available eternally has been suddenly snatched away by flames. Notre Dame will be rebuilt, but it will never quite be the same Notre Dame that existed before the fire. Advertisement "
German High Court to Rule on Right to Suicide | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Wesley J. Smith,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/german-high-court-to-rule-on-right-to-suicide/,"Follow Wesley J. Smith on Twitter April 16, 2019 10:31 AM
It is an unfortunate feature of the contemporary age that many look at suicide as a human right to be enabled (in some cases, for now) rather than a tragedy to be prevented whenever possible. Now, in Germany, that question is about to be decided by the country’s highest court. From the DW story:
Actively aiding someone to knowingly commit suicide, however, is explicitly outlawed in Germany: The Bundestag passed legislation in 2015 banning the sale or prescription of drugs meant to end a patient’s life. Any physician, organization or private individual found to have distributed such drugs faces up to five years in prison under the law. "

(Carlos Barria/REUTERS)
Nation of Islam founder and notorious anti-Semite Louis Farrakhan defended Representative Ilhan Omar’s glib description of the September 11 attacks Monday by dismissing the attacks as nothing more than a false-flag operation designed to draw the U.S. into Middle Eastern conflicts.
In a video posted to YouTube last year and tweeted out Monday by the Nation of Islam account, Farrakhan accuses the Bush administration of orchestrating the 9/11 attacks in order “to get the country into war at the expense of young patriotic men and women.”
“3,133 Scientists Back Ilhan Omar on 9/11 Deep skepticism exists about the gov’t version of 9/11. Many experts—architects & engineers—say the World Trade Center Towers were destroyed in a controlled demolition. Listen to @LouisFarrakhan # IStandWithIlhan,” reads the tweet, which includes a link to the video.
The tweet expresses Farrakhan’s support for Omar, who has received an onslaught of criticism from Republican lawmakers and conservative pundits for using the phrase “some people did something” to describe the World Trade Center attacks, which killed more than 3,000 Americans.
Farrakhan has previously blamed a cabal of highly placed Jewish government officials for helping to execute the attacks.
“There were many Israelis and Zionist Jews in key roles in the 9/11 attacks,” he said in 2015. Stay Updated with NR Daily
NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.
Omar referred to the attack as “something” during a speech before the the Council on American-Islamic Relations last week, in which she also falsely claimed that the group was founded to fight the anti-Muslim discrimination that followed the 9/11 attacks. The organization, which has ties to the Hamas terror, was actually founded in 1994.
The backlash against Omar escalated after the New York Post printed her words on the front cover along with an image of the twin towers at the moment of impact. President Trump then joined fray, tweeting out a video montage of the attacks accompanied by Omar’s words.
In a video that surfaced last week, Omar can be seen dismissing the threat posed by al-Qaeda and other Islamic terror groups as a laughing matter and mocking Americans who display discomfort when discussing the groups, who she implies are no different than the American or British governments."
Conservative and Labour Parties Are Both Unfit to Govern Britain | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Douglas Murray,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/british-conservative-and-labour-parties-are-both-unfit-to-govern/,"About Douglas Murray April 16, 2019 1:47 PM A street vendor selling Union Jack flags passes a pro-Brexit supporter outside the Houses of Parliament in London, England, March 28, 2019.

A great question looms over British politics. Should we smash the major parties? By “major parties” I obviously mean the Conservative and Labour parties. And when I say “we” I mean, of course, the British voting public. Since the government delayed Brexit once again this month, it seems that Britons will soon be asked to vote in this year’s European Parliament election. That will be three years after we voted to leave the European Union. With the Conservative government showing a monumental incompetence in matters great and small it looks as though we might also face a general election before this parliament comes to its purported end in 2022. Suddenly it looks as though the two-party system which was meant to be uncrackable could finally crack. Advertisement Advertisement
A YouGov poll carried out last week showed Labour coming top of the forthcoming EU elections (24 percent) and the Conservatives down 8 percent to only 16 percent. Only just behind them are Nigel Farage’s new Brexit party (15 percent) and Nigel Farage’s old Brexit party, UKIP (14 percent). So in the EU Parliament elections the Conservatives could well be beaten by a party that didn’t exist until last week. Some Conservatives appear to think, “Well that’s just the European elections: the public were always badly behaved during those.” Except that the British public’s ill-discipline no longer appears to be limiting itself to European elections. A YouGov poll on voting intentions in a general (domestic) election shows the Conservatives four points behind Labour at just 28 percent. For such an election the Brexit party and UKIP poll 8 percent and 6 percent respectively. And so we see the possibility here not just of a Labour government but of the Conservative party being destroyed.
Like a lot of Conservative voters, I no longer abhor the prospect. Not because we relish a Corbyn government — very far from it. A Corbyn government would put Britain on a road to national decline that would make the 1970s look like our heydays. But the Corbyn Labour party has its own problems. It is fighting against its own parliamentary party and in the country as a whole there is now a clear divide between the pro-EU Labour party that dominates in metropolitan areas like Islington (Corbyn’s own constituency) and the vast swathes of the north of England who voted to leave the European Union and are the Labour party’s only remaining base.

The obvious thing for Labour is also to split. Something that began to happen in February when half a dozen Labour MPs (lead by Chuka Ummuna, once a Blairite hopeful for the party) walked out to form the “Independent Group,” which has now also been joined by a gaggle of “Remain” Conservative-elected MPs. This group also plans to run at forthcoming elections. And so when the British people next go to the ballot we might at least have a party to vote for that really wants to leave the EU and a party that really wants to stay in, rather than two parties that pretend that they want to leave.

If Britain’s relationship with the EU is going to continue to dominate our politics then this all has its advantages. But there are two meaningful problems. The first comes if Britain actually manages to leave the EU. In such a situation both new parties would surely slump — the main order of the day having been at least temporarily addressed. Each may continue to campaign to take us in their favored direction some years down the line, but a broad majority of the public would most likely believe the question to have been addressed at that point, and wish other questions — education, health, the economy, the rest of the world — to be addressed at some stage.

Pete Buttigieg: Capitalism Has 'Let a Lot of People Down' | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Mairead Mcardle,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/news/buttigieg-capitalism-has-let-a-lot-of-people-down/,"Follow Mairead McArdle on Twitter April 16, 2019 3:04 PM Democratic 2020 presidential candidate and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg campaigns at Gibson’s Bookstore in Concord, N.H., April 6, 2019. (Mary Schwalm/Reuters)
Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg offered an explanation Tuesday for why socialism has caught on lately among some lawmakers and voters.
“I think the reason we’re having this argument over socialism and capitalism is that capitalism has let a lot of people down,” the South Bend, Ind. mayor said on CNN, before stressing that democratic norms must underpin the capitalist system. “At the end of the day, we prioritize democracy. And having that framework of a rule of law, of fairness, is actually what it takes for markets to work.”
Buttigieg told CNBC last week that the U.S. is at a moment where “concentrated wealth has begun to turn into concentrated power.”
“American capitalism is one of the most productive forces ever known to man, and there’s so much that this country has been able to unlock, especially in the last century, in terms of technology, in terms of prosperity,” he said . “Now where it goes wrong is when it’s only being experienced in certain parts of the country or by certain kinds of people, and I think it goes to show just how important it is for capitalism to work that it be backed by all of the other pieces that business alone can’t solve.” Stay Updated with NR Daily

(John Gress/Reuters) He has zero appeal to religious conservatives because he holds to the Democratic party line on the right to kill viable, living unborn babies.
W ith every passing day, it seems we see yet another piece about South Bend mayor Pete Buttigieg’s progressive Christianity. His faith is going to shake the race. He’s going to challenge the GOP monopoly on “God talk.” Here, for example, is the opening paragraph of an NBC News analysis posted yesterday afternoon:
Religious conservatives who have long been a reliable voting bloc for Republicans are grappling with a new challenge in Pete Buttigieg: how to respond to a Democratic presidential candidate who is leaning into the discussion about faith and its role in political life.
I’ll agree that there are religious conservatives who are “grappling” with a challenge from Buttigieg, but that challenge is theological and cultural, not political. Buttigieg’s religious arguments have triggered important online debates about the differences between mainline and Evangelical Christianity, about when religious teachings should influence public policy, and about how to interpret the history of the gay-marriage debate.
But religious conservatives are not grappling with the key political question — whether any meaningful number of Evangelicals or conservative Catholics would cross the aisle to cast a ballot for Mayor Pete. The reason is simple. Buttigieg is a pro-choice extremist, and no pro-choice extremist will ever meaningfully compete for the conservative Christian vote.
In fact, in at least one key way, Buttigieg’s record on abortion is even worse than that of his Democratic peers. He is of course in lockstep agreement with them on support for late-term abortion, and he made that clear last month on Morning Joe : Advertisement . @PeteButtigieg explains his support for late-term abortion bills in New York and Virginia:

But he’s done what many of them have not — he’s actually blocked a crisis-pregnancy center from opening at its chosen location. He not only supports abortion rights, he’s taken action against law-abiding Americans who merely wanted to make the case for life. Advertisement Advertisement
Last April, Buttigieg vetoed a rezoning plan that would have permitted a crisis-pregnancy center to open next door to a proposed abortion clinic. In his statement justifying the veto, Buttigieg said, “I don’t think it would be responsible to situate two groups, literally right next to each other, in a neighborhood, that have diametrically opposed views on the most divisive social issue of our time.”
And so, given the conflict, he chose to privilege the abortion clinic’s location over the pregnancy center. Thankfully, the center found a new location across the street from the proposed clinic — a location that didn’t require a rezoning vote. But that does not excuse or justify Buttigieg’s veto. He favored abortion rights over pro-life speech, and he likely violated the Constitution in doing so.
While Buttigieg, to his credit, did not demonize his opponents in the South Bend dispute ( “Many people that I respect and admire and appreciate have very passionate and very opposite views on what is the right thing to do,” he said of the dispute), actions speak louder than words. And this action echoes a dangerous Democratic trend in pro-choice governance: the attack against pro-life pregnancy clinics. Advertisement
Across the United States, progressive legislatures have passed laws aimed at crisis-pregnancy centers, including a California law the Supreme Court struck down just last summer. Buttigieg hasn’t gone as far as California, which actually required pro-life pregnancy centers to promote state-funded free and low-cost abortions. But he had an opportunity to fully respect the constitutional rights of his pro-life opponents, and he chose not to do so. Advertisement
Many young Evangelicals, including young Evangelical activists, are divided over matters such as same-sex marriage. Some believe Obergefell v. Hodges was wrongly decided, others support legal recognition of same-sex marriage so long as the state doesn’t interfere with the church’s ability to define marriage according to the historic doctrines of the Christian faith. Others support same-sex marriage constitutionally and theologically.
These same young Christians are often appalled that their older brothers and sisters in the faith have so easily overlooked Donald Trump’s multitude of sins. But they will not support politicians who support legal protections for late-term abortions. They won’t. The will not support politicians who don’t go beyond “respecting” pro-life Americans to also protecting their rights to free speech with the same vigor that they protect the First Amendment rights of pro-choice Americans.

Notre Dame's Crown of Thorns -- The Heroic Priest Who Saved Jesus' Crown | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Madeleine Kearns,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/the-heroic-priest-who-saved-the-crown-of-thorns/,"About Madeleine Kearns April 16, 2019 3:58 PM The Holy Crown of Thorns is displayed during a ceremony at Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris, France, March 21, 2014.

As reports of yesterday’s fire at Notre-Dame de Paris continue to emerge, so too do the stories of its heroes.
Father Jean-Marc Fournier, the chaplain of the Paris Fire Brigade, risked life and limb to retrieve the invaluable Crown of Thorns — a religious relic believed to have been worn by Christ during His passion which was first brought to Paris by King Louis IX in 1238 — as well as the Blessed Sacrament (the consecrated bread which Catholics believe to be the body of Christ.)

This is not the first time Father Fournier has put himself in harm’s way. He served in the Diocese of the French Armed Forces in Afghanistan. And in 2015, gave comfort to the victims of a terrorist attack when 130 people were murdered and 494 were wounded by Islamists in the French capital."
