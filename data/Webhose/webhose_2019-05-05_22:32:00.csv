Tallinn, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - APP - 5th Apr, 2019 ) :Estonia's president on Friday tasked liberal Reform party leader Kaja Kallas with forming a new government , a month after her Reform party won an inconclusive election that has made it difficult for her to forge a majority coalition.
Should Kallas succeed, the 41-year-old lawyer and staunchly pro-EU former MEP will become Estonia 's first woman prime minister , but she faces tough competition.
Juri Ratas, leader of the runner-up centre-left Centre party who stepped down as prime minister on Thursday has spurned a coalition offer from Kallas.
He subsequently appears to have succeeded in building a controversial majority coalition with the anti-EU far-right EKRE party and the Isamaa conservatives in a bid to cling to power and to prevent Kallas from taking office.
But President Kersti Kaljulaid, who has expressed concerns about including a far-right group in government , said on Friday that she wanted to give election winner Kallas a chance to rally a majority.
""Today I made the first offer to form the government to the Reform Party chairwoman Kaja Kallas,"" the president said.
Kallas said she was accepting the offer ""to send society a message that politics can be done in a positive, dignified and open way, without humiliating or threatening anyone. "" Last month, EKRE party leader Mart Helme threatened riots should he fail to secure a coalition deal with Ratas's Centre and Isamaa.
In a signal that Ratas has succeeded in clinching a majority coalition, EKRE MP Henn Polluaas was elected parliamentary speaker on Thursday by 55 members during the first post-election sitting of the 101-seat chamber .
Kallas now has two weeks to cobble together a coalition. If she fails, the president will have to tap a new candidate.
Kallas said Friday that she invited the last-spot Social Democrats for coalition talks, but the two parties could only propose a vulnerable 44-seat minority government .
Analyst Rein Toomla told AFP that ""it is unlikely that Kaja Kallas can form a majority government .
""A Centre-Isamaa-EKRE coalition now seems more certain,"" the Tartu University lecturer said.
Support for the EKRE more than doubled to 19 seats in the March 3 election , buoyed by mostly rural voters hurting after years of tight spending under governments led by establishment parties Reform and Centre.
Bread-and-butter issues such as taxation and public spending dominated the election in the 1.3 million-strong country known for its IT savvy and the eurozone's lowest debt-to-GDP ratio."

Channel migrant crossings in sharp decline: France,www.urdupoint.com,,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.urdupoint.com/en/world/channel-migrant-crossings-in-sharp-decline-f-586609.html,"Channel Migrant Crossings In Sharp Decline: France Faizan Hashmi 1 day ago Fri 05th April 2019 | 02:54 PM The number of migrants trying to smuggle across the Channel from France to Britain by boat has fallen sharply after a spike late last year, authorities in northern France said late Thursday
Tardinghen, France, April 5 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - APP - 5th Apr, 2019 ) :The number of migrants trying to smuggle across the Channel from France to Britain by boat has fallen sharply after a spike late last year, authorities in northern France said late Thursday.
Between January and March this year, 23 vessels carrying about 200 people managed to reach England's shores, down from 39 carrying 286 people between October and December , the head of security for the northern Pas-de-Calais region, Fabien Sudry, told reporters.
Sudry attributed the decline to tighter patrols along the northern French coast, long a staging post for attempts by mainly Afghan , Iranian, Iraqi and African migrants to reach England.
A helicopter, drones, night vision goggles and motocross bikes that can be ridden across the dunes have all been used to patrol a stretch of coast measuring around 80 kilometres (50 miles), he said, adding that the police also carried out between 8 and 15 patrols on foot each day.
Most attempt to stow away on trucks crossing the Channel through the Eurotunnel in the port of Calais , where a huge migrant camp was demolished in 2016 .
But last year, the authorities noted an increase in the numbers braving the world 's busiest shipping channel in small dinghies or stolen fishing boats, particularly Iranians and Iraqis.
""Unfortunately there still are some (crossings) but we have noted a sharp decline,"" Sudry said.
French police intervened 15 times between January and March to prevent groups of migrants putting out to sea, down from 22 times in the last three months of 2018 , he said.
Some 500 people attempted to cross the Channel last year, compared with just 13 known attempts in 2017 . Around half managed to reach British waters.
The numbers represent a tiny fraction of the numbers crossing the Mediterranean from North Africa ."

Wellington, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - APP - 5th Apr, 2019 ) :The Ardie Savea-inspired Wellington Hurricanes survived a dramatic late fightback to end Otago Highlanders' two-year home winning streak 31-28 in Dunedin Friday.
Flanker Savea scored two of the Hurricanes' four tries and prevented the Highlanders crossing the line at least once, with his ferocious defence in a frantic match that went down to the wire.
The Highlanders had three lineouts after the full-time siren but could not break through, slumping to their first loss at Forsyth Barr Stadium since March 4, 2017 .
""Obviously the guys are hurting,"" captain Luke Whitelock said after a fourth straight loss for the Highlanders.
""But it's a long competition and we're just going to make sure we rock up (to training) Sunday and prepare well for the Crusaders next week."" The result gives the Hurricanes five wins from eight matches and skipper TJ Perenara said it restored confidence after a 32-8 loss to Canterbury Crusaders last week.
""We played better footy and didn't make as many errors down their end of the field, which is something we did last week,"" he said.
""We had to look at ourselves and take our opportunities and tonight we did."" It was an end-to-end start, with both sides enjoying early chances under the closed roof but squandering them through forward passes and handling errors.
The Highlanders drew first blood when Shannon Frizell barged over the line but TJ Perenara hit back on the next play to lock the scores at 7-7.
The home team's forwards then exerted control as hooker Ash Dixon scored from a driving maul only for Savea to level again with a length-of-the-field intercept try just before the break.
The Highlanders were missing injured All Black Aaron Smith but Kayne Hammington proved an able replacement at halfback, scoring his side's third try from the back of a scrum.
James Lentjes added a fourth from another lineout drive but Savea ensured it was not one-way traffic when he stepped around three defenders and narrowed the gap to 28-24.
Ngani Laumape put the Hurricanes ahead and they held on for the win even though lock Liam Mitchell was sin-binned as they defended the Highlanders' late flurry of lineouts."

Islamabad (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News – 5th April, 2019) The Indian authorities have handed over the dead body of Pakistani fisherman who was allegedly beaten to death by the jail staff of the Indian prison on March 29.
The victim, identified as Noor-ul-Ameen, had scrummed to his injuries inflected on him by the Indian jail staff.
The dead body was handed over to Pakistani authorities at Wagah Border on Friday.
Burney Trust International head Ansar Burney said that the fisherman’s dead body has been shifted to Karachi .
Ameen will be buried in Korangi today.
Ameen was arrested at sea by the Indian coastguard on September 30, 2017 during a fishing trip along with six other fishermen when their boats drifted to the Indian side by mistake. Despite, he has been completed his prisoner term, he was not released by the Indian jail staff. Ameen left four young children, wife , and parents in mourn. He was sole bread winners of his family .
Noorul Ameen's daughter informed the media that some two weeks ago they received a call in which they were informed that Ameen has died . The family had appealed the government to take measures to bring his body back to the country.
According to Pakistan Fisher Fork Forum, currently over 150 Pakistani fishermen are languishing in Indian jails, including the three who have been in jail for the past 20 years.
Another prisoner , identified as Ameer Hamza, is reported to be suffering cancer disease. The fishermen organizations termed Ameen's death a murder in the hands of Indian prisoners. He had been arrested by Indian forces in 2010. Then he had been released as goodwill gesture.
It is pertinent to mention here that India has removed brain and heart of previously murdered prisoner Shakirullah. Facebook Twitter Google + Related Topics"

MOSCOW (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 05th April, 2019) Around 60 fragments of India 's Microsat-R military satellite are currently flying in orbit, 46 of which are flying in orbits located above the apogee of the International Space Station (ISS), according to the US Air Force's catalog, published on space-track.org website.
India successfully tested its anti-missile weapon on March 27, destroying the Microsat-R in low-Earth orbit. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has praised this as a benchmark event , stressing that the test has proven India 's ability to safeguard its space assets. Meanwhile, NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine has slammed the test, saying that it had created at least 400 pieces of debris, increasing the risk of the ISS colliding with debris by 44 percent.
The US Air Force's catalog currently includes 57 Microsat-R fragments flying in orbits at altitudes from 159 kilometers to 2,248 kilometers (99-1,397 miles). As many as 46 of these fragments are flying in orbits above the ISS apogee, which stands at around 400 kilometers.
Ivan Moiseev, the head of the Russian Institute for Space Policy, told Sputnik that fragments flying above the ISS were a threat, albeit an insignificant one.
""There is a threat coming from the Indian satellite, but it is a highly unlikely one,"" Moiseev said, explaining that the risk of collision was low because the ISS and the fragments had different inclinations.
Microsat-R, designed by the Indian Defense Research and Development Organization, was launched into orbit atop the PSLV carrier in January ."

Bangkok, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - APP - 5th Apr, 2019 ) :Thailand's Election Commission said Friday that scores of candidates who were tipped to secure elected seats in last month's contentious polls are under investigation and could be disqualified, in a move that could shift yet-to-be-released final results.
The commission has come under fire for bungling ballot counts and delaying official results following the much-anticipated March 24 election , the first since a 2014 military coup.
The election has pitted the junta-backed Palang Pracharat party against Pheu Thai, a popular anti-military faction linked to an exiled billionaire.
Both have claimed the right to govern in the wake of polls with final tallies not expected for several weeks.
An election commissioner said Friday the body will investigate ""66 people who got the highest votes in the constituency system"" who were hit with complaints.
""Whether these 66 candidates would be disqualified would have to depend on our investigation,"" said commissioner Pakorn Mahannop.
He added that investigation results ""will affect the calculation"" of final parliamentary seats.
Commission officials did not say what parties the candidates belonged to but said 300 complaints had been filed.
The vote is governed under a new military-scripted constitution that delegates 350 lower parliament seats to candidates who won their Constituencies .
Another 150 ""party list"" seats will be allocated based on popular vote .
The 250 upper house seats are military-appointed, stacking the balance of power strongly in its favour.
Thailand's Election Commission has been dogged with criticism since the poll over bungled vote counts, inconsistent tallies and more than 2.1 million invalidated ballots.
Earlier this week it ordered a re-count in two polling stations and a new vote in six polling sites, citing conflicting numbers between voter turnout and ballots tabulated.
The body had previously said a final tally would be announced by May 9, but Pakorn said Friday complete results may take even longer.
Early numbers showed Pheu Thai, the party linked to ex-premier Thaksin Shinawatra, securing the majority of the constituency seats, with 137.
Junta-backed Palang Pracharat followed them with 97 seats, but they gained the highest in the popular vote -- which tips their prime minister candidate junta leader Prayut Chan-O-Cha to return as a civilian premier."

Silao, Mexico, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - APP - 5th Apr, 2019 ) :A gang of armed thieves stole about 20 million pesos ($1 million ) from an armored truck that was about to load the money onto a plane at an international airport in central Mexico , authorities and reports said.
The brazen robbery took place Wednesday night when an armed gang in a van evaded security at Guanajuato International Airport , the state attorney's office said.
An initial report from the authorities said ""armed individuals threatened cargo personnel and robbed them"" of sacks of cash in a robbery that took just three minutes, although it did not confirm the amount stolen. Local reports said they made off with about 20 million pesos.
In a later statement, airport operator Grupo Aeroportuario del Pac fico said the gang of hooded and armed thieves broke through the perimeter fence to carry out the robbery before escaping by knocking down a different section of the fence.
On December 14, a truck with 118 million pesos ($6.2 million ) on board was intercepted in southeast Guanajuato and the money stolen.
The vehicle was found buried in a nearby town.
Guanajuato is one of Mexico 's most important industrial centers with a concentration of large international manufacturers of automobiles, planes and other heavy industry .
These activities, as well as the presence of important energy infrastructure, have attracted criminal organizations which engage in activities such as extortion, kidnapping and stealing fuel, according to authorities."

Tripoli, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - APP - 5th Apr, 2019 ) :Forces loyal to Libyan strongman Khalifa Haftar were pushed back Friday from a key checkpoint less than 30 kilometres (18 miles) from Tripoli , checking their lightning advance on the capital, a security source said.
Militiamen from the coastal town of Zawiya, west of Tripoli , retook the base after a ""short exchange of fire "", the source said on condition of anonymity.
The advance by Haftar's forces on Thursday, which came as the United Nations prepares to convene a conference later this month on holding delayed elections, prompted visiting UN chief Antonio Guterres to voice his ""deep concern"".
The UN Security Council was to hold an urgent meeting on the crisis later on Friday as Western governments appealed for restraint.
Traffic was flowing normally past the checkpoint on Friday morning, an AFP correspondent reported.
Just a single armoured vehicle was seen the allegiance of its occupants was not immediately clear.
The Zawiya militia is one of dozens that have proliferated since the overthrow of veteran dictator Moamer Kadhafi in a NATO-backed uprising in 2011 and are variously aligned with the UN-backed unity government in the capital and a rival administration in the east backed by Haftar's forces.
Most of the pro-Haftar fighters who briefly captured the checkpoint late on Thursday were militiamen from the rival town of Sabratha further west along the Mediterranean coast.
Dozens of them were captured and their vehicles seized, the security source said.
Pictures posted on social media of men in military uniform sitting on the ground purported to show some of those taken prisoner , but their authenticity could not immediately be verified.
The Tripoli Protection Force, an alliance of pro-government militias in the capital, said its fighters had taken part in the recapture of the checkpoint 27 kilometres (17 miles) to its south.
The alliance said it had named its operation ""Ouadi Doum II"" after an airbase in northern Chad where Libyan forces commanded by Haftar, then still loyal to Kadhafi, suffered a major reverse at the hands of the French air force in 1986.
Haftar has remained a deeply controversial figure since he returned from exile after the revolution, with his critics accusing him of seeking to establish a new dictatorship with the support of his Gulf Arab allies. Facebook Twitter Google + Related Topics"

""The certificate for the VK-2500 helicopter turboshaft engine, which is developed and produced by St. Petersburg 's JSC UEC-Klimov [part of Rostec's United Engine Corporation, UEC] has been validated in China . Now it will be possible to use this propulsion system for Russian civil helicopters in China , and this will expand the geographical scope of Russian Mi and Ka helicopters sales and use,"" the statement read.
Rostec stressed that the Civil Aviation Administration of China had certified a Russian-made helicopter engine for the first time in 19 years.
""The UEC will proceed with certifying the VK-2500PS-03 engine in China as part of a helicopter and with validating certificates for the VK-2500PS-03 engine in India , South Korea , Brazil and Mexico ,"" the press service added.
The VK-2500 turboshaft engine, made exclusively from Russian parts, was designed to replace the TV3-117. It features a digital automatic control system instead of an analog one and has advanced sensors.

Make the people on the Mexican side be ""invested"" in border security. Keep the Mexican side free of Criminal Invaders, to keep the border open to legal traffic.

London, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - APP - 5th Apr, 2019 ) : Prime Minister Theresa May asked the European Union on Friday to delay Britain's departure from the bloc until June 30, with the extension ending earlier if parliament approves her Brexit deal.
""The United Kingdom proposes that (the extension) should end on June 30 2019 . If the parties are able to ratify before this date , the government proposes that the period should be terminated earlier,"" May wrote in a letter to EU Council president Donald Tusk.
Downing Street released May 's letter moments after a senior EU official told AFP that Tusk was proposing to postpone Brexit day by up to a year, also pending parliament 's approval of the EU-UK Withdrawal Agreement .
The current deadline is April 12, which has already been pushed back once from March 29 because of the UK parliament 's failure on three occasions to back the deal May signed with the other 27 EU leaders in December .
In her letter, May said she wanted to make sure that Britain left the bloc after 46 years in an orderly manner, with an agreement that could help unwind intricate political, security, diplomatic and economic ties.
""The government 's policy has always been and remains to leave the European Union in an orderly way, and without undue delay,"" May wrote.
""The government agrees that leaving with a deal is the best outcome,"" she said. Facebook Twitter Google + Related Topics"
