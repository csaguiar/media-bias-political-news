Facing The Heat,newpol.org,Jason Schulman,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://newpol.org/facing-the-heat/,"[PDF] [Print]
In all the long duration of human history, from the ancient sacred crypts of Egypt to the glistening towers of our coastal megapolises, there has never been a crisis as severe, as devastating, or as cataclysmic as the one unfolding now. Unless drastic changes are made in very short order to the human social system that encompasses the planet, dire and frightening transformations that cannot be reversed will develop in the Earth’s climate, its ocean, and its biosphere. Never has a generation faced a challenge of this magnitude. The fate of all present and future humans, and of the millions of species that share the Earth with us, now hinges on the choices and actions taken immediately by the present generation alive on the planet today.
This is not hyperbole. Scanning the daily news brings only alarm and foreboding. Crocodiles and snakes swimming down the flooded streets in Queensland, Australia after four feet of rain fell in ten days. 1 Rising temperatures in the Himalayas will melt at least one-third of the glaciers by the end of the century, even if the most ambitious climate change targets are met; if they are not and greenhouse gas emissions continue at their current rates, the Himalayas could lose two-thirds of its glaciers by 2100, exposing billions to droughts and forcing massive immigration from the region. 2
Even what appears to be good news on the climate front turns out to spell disaster. A headline in the online journal CleanTechnica reports that the the pace of global warming has slowed, thanks to higher carbon prices and increased political ambition to tackle climate change, according to Schroders, a global asset manager that publishes a Climate Progress Dashboard. Reading further we find that their tracking of the progress of limiting global warming to the the 2℃ above pre-Industrial levels set by the Paris Agreement had us on a path to a 4℃ rise but that recently “with higher carbon prices being implemented and increased political ambition to tackle climate change . . . the pace of global warming has slowed, slightly, and the world is now currently on course for a long-run temperature rise of 3.9°C”! 3 This is not progress, this is the road to hell. A 4°C world is not a place anyone would care to exist in. It would result in sea levels a half meter or more above current levels. If tipping points are triggered, further destabilizing the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets, sea levels would rise even higher, flooding many of the world’s most populous cities, causing hundreds of millions of people to flee inland, and sparking a massive world-wide wave of migration that would dwarf today’s migrant crises. It could lead to a sea level rise of as much as 25 meters within the next few centuries. A 4°C world would devastate the world’s agricultural production, with many of the world’s breadbaskets becoming untenable due to desertification. Ocean circulation would slow down or stop, producing wild, unpredictable weather and storms of unimaginable ferocity. Summers will be longer, hotter, and dryer, causing huge wildfires and unlivable conditions in many areas. 4 It is important to realize that not only would these changes be irreversible on any meaningful human timescale, but once the 2℃ level is breached, cascading tipping points would almost assuredly kick in, producing a runaway temperature escalation that would not stabilize again until it reached the 4℃ mark or beyond.
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) issued a revised report in January 2019 on the impacts of global warming of 1.5℃ above pre-industrial levels. It tells us that due to human activities we are now at 1℃ above pre-industrial temperature. CO2 levels are higher than at any time in the past 400,000 years, that is, since well before homo sapiens evolved. Global warming is likely to reach 1.5℃ by 2030 to 2052, if it continues to increase at the current rate, and reach 2℃ by 2045 to 2065 if emissions are not reduced. The IPCC report presents a graph of two possible future pathways, one limiting temperature rise to 1.5℃ and another to 2℃, both of which require the world to reach net zero carbon emissions. The faster net zero is achieved the better the chances of stabilizing the temperature rise. If we can attain zero emission by 2040, there is high confidence of limiting the warming to 1.5℃ by that year whereas a slower reduction, not reaching zero until 2055, will increase the probability of not leveling off before 2℃ is reached. Both these scenarios also involve reducing the net non-CO2 greenhouse gases such as methane, nitrous oxide, aerosols and other anthropogenic agents. 5 The consequence would still be severe even if the temperature rise is halted at 1.5℃ and truly abominable at 2℃. The pain will not be spread evenly either, with the poorest and most vulnerable people being the most effected. Furthermore, the CO2 that is in the atmosphere and oceans when net zero is met will stay there. The elevated global temperature and the climate changes it produces will become the new normal for the planet. It will not be naturally reduced back to present levels for thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands, of years.
It becomes clear to any reasonable person absorbing these facts that the governments, institutions, and businesses of the world must strive to effect the necessary reductions in emissions and reach net zero by mid-century or earlier. It is also clear that we are nowhere near achieving this level of commitment and in fact the international energy consortiums are continuing to extract, refine, and burn fossil fuel at an expanded rate. Even as investment in renewable energy is increasing and wind, solar, and geothermal sources of energy production continue to grow, it is shrinking relative to that in fossil fuels. Global fossil fuel consumption has increased by 40% from 2000 to 2016, with most of the increase due to natural gas from fracking. 6
We have been told over and over again that while it is technically possible to bring our emissions down, the political will to do so is lacking. The political will will never materialize, however, as long as the richest corporations continue to exert their power over the world’s governments and public institutions. Of the ten largest corporations in the world, eight are oil and gas companies, automotive companies, and the giant state-owned Chinese electrical utility, State Grid. 7 The fossil fuel corporations continue to roam the world financing new drilling and mining of carbon, carbon that must not be allowed to leave the ground if we are to avoid the worse-case scenarios. While they take advantage of new and more extreme forms of extraction such as deep water drilling, fracking, and tar sands which are more intensive producers of greenhouse gas and lay waste to the environments and communities they exploit, they engage in massive P.R. campaigns touting their commitment to renewable energy. Shell and Exxon Mobil have even invested in wind and solar energy projects in the past, although many of these projects have since been scuttled. As the Swedish environmentalist Andreas Malm has said, “For the world’s climate it doesn’t matter much if the market for renewable fuels is booming. What matters is that we stop using fossil fuels, right now.” 8
But it is more than just the power and profit of fossil fuel companies that keeps the world careening down its reckless path to Hothouse Earth. It is the dynamics of the entire economic system itself that compels this behavior. This is what must be addressed if we are to achieve a net zero economy. The climate scientists who have done the research and raised the warning are far more familiar with natural science than they are with social science. More and more, however, their reports come with recommendations for the participation of the humanities and social sciences in helping to deal with the human piece of the Earth System. They recognize that it is human society that has brought this problem on itself, and human society that so far has been unable to curtail the behavior that is exacerbating the problem: the continued burning of massive quantities of fossil fuel. They understand that society must be changed, but understanding the dynamics of human social organization is a different matter from deducing the physical processes involved in climate change. Calls for radical changes to the way that energy is produced, changes that would surely disrupt the present business as usual, have led to political backlash against the whole project. As climate science struggles to understand the complex system that entangles human society and the Earth System, it ventures into the unfamiliar waters of political economy and ideological battle.
Scientists are not usually embroiled through their work in political and ideological struggles. This would seem to have been especially true of climate scientists until fairly recently. Environmental protection and energy conservation were accepted by both political parties in the United States up until the Reagan era, when the corporate elite began to see the environmental movement as part of a threat to their free-market policies and instituted a campaign against the social reforms that had been promoted in the ’60s and ’70s, funding right-wing think tanks, journals, and media outlets. The solar panels that Jimmy Carter had installed on the roof of the White House were ordered removed when Reagan assumed office. However, as Naomi Klein has pointed out, taking measures to control global warming and reduce CO2 emissions was still a somewhat bipartisan project as recently as 2007, but since then the Tea Party-controlled Republican Party has increasingly attacked climate science as a UN-orchestrated plot to take away individual freedoms. Klein makes a telling point, that “as soon as they [hard core conservatives] admit that climate change is real, they will lose the central ideological battle of our time—whether we need to plan and manage our societies to reflect our goals and values, or whether that task can be left to the magic of the market.” 9 The right wing’s fear that climate change will become a vehicle for overhauling the market-regulated economy that has produced global warming may be a more accurate assessment of the situation than the mainstream belief in market-based solutions such as cap-and-trade and faith in reckless and dangerous geoengineering projects.
The failure over the last 30 years of market-based solutions to slow the growth of CO2 emissions is an indication that the measures needed to put an end to fossil fuel combustion and transform the world’s energy system are beyond the ability of the market to effect. Time is fast running out and the longer the wait to reduce emissions, the more drastic the measures needed to reach net zero in time. In the absence of a market-generated remedy, government intervention on a large and drastic scale will be advocated to put a stop to all oil, gas, and coal extraction, and to build the needed renewable energy infrastructure. This is the great fear of much of corporate America and its right-wing minions and while that level of government action does not appear to be a serious issue at the present moment, the reality of the climate crisis will increasingly insert itself into politics as usual.
The Green New Deal proposes to achieve net zero emissions in time to prevent runaway global warming. After decades of inaction from the national government it is a welcome sign. There is little reason, however, to believe that the radical reforms it calls for will be accepted without a massive movement behind it. Stricter regulation of corporations, expansion of the public sector, and higher taxes for the affluent will not only be bitterly fought by those in power, they are quite possibly incompatible with the system’s requirement of continuing capital expansion, an expansion that has been premised throughout the world on unimpeded access to fossil fuel, avoidance of restrictive environmental regulations, and the weakening of labor laws allowing for the expanded exploitation of labor. What’s missing from the debate over the Green New Deal is a critical understanding of the dynamics of capitalism. Without it, calls for the changes necessary for a sustainable economy and thus a sustainable planet will be rejected as impossible economically as well as politically, given that the health of the capitalist economy, its continued unending economic growth, is a sine qua non of any political policy that seeks to be a player.
The reaction to the Green New Deal from Trump and Fox News was apoplectic as expected, but much of the liberal establishment was dismissive as well, though more on pragmatic grounds. Ken Caldeira , an atmospheric researcher had this to say on NPR: “In my own subjective assessment, getting to near-zero emissions over the next decade would be physically possible but sociopolitically infeasible.” So what does it mean if, with the fate of the Earth hanging in the balance, the means to save us is physically possible but the sociopolitical system rules it out?
Climate change is not a consequence of human nature, it is not the result of personal greed or ignorance, and it is not the failure of individual resolve. It is the result of a system of human interactions on a planet-wide scale that follow laws of motion undirected by conscious planning but that require the constant expansion of human social production. From the beginning, that growth entailed the unimpeded consumption of the “free gifts” of nature as capitalists spread their system throughout the world, gobbling up the natural resources of colonized peoples, including in many cases the people themselves.
The continued growth of capital has always been hampered by periodic crises that have thrown the economy into recessions and depressions in which businesses failed, workers lost their jobs, and massive amounts of capital lost value. Those crises led after much suffering to new periods of growth and renewed capital expansion, but the present ecological crisis is something entirely different that will soon destroy the conditions in which any advanced society can operate. There will be no recovery and return to another round of growth once planetary conditions rule out the possibility of complex human society. Before that, however, the costs of mitigating the growing disasters will severely limit the ability of the capitalist system to accumulate the surplus needed for its continued expansion and world wide economic collapse will loom.
Meanwhile, today, as catastrophic climate events continue to run rampant across the planet, policy in the world’s largest economy is directed by people who deny human-caused global warming. They plan to increase as much as possible the extraction and burning of fossil fuel and do all they can to block any attempts to transition to renewable energy at a time when it is imperative that the vast quantities of fossil fuel held in reserve by energy companies remain in the ground. Their denial of human causes of global warming, despite the overwhelming evidence, is founded on their own blatant self interest. However, there are other more subtle forms of climate change denial as well. Many who acknowledge the danger are nevertheless in denial about the need to radically change the way human society impacts the planetary system, the metabolic relationship between society and environment. They hold on to an unreasonable faith that technology can save us. Schemes for dumping huge amounts of sulfur dioxide into the upper stratosphere or launching reflective material in order to block sunlight are considered by most scientists to be open to dangerous unforeseen consequences, like severe droughts and the rapid warming of the atmosphere to even greater temperatures if it were ever halted. Nevertheless, the longer the termination of greenhouse gas emissions is forestalled, the greater will be the push for these types of desperate and perilous measures. Others retain a blind faith in the market’s ability to somehow mysteriously solve the problem. Both approaches represent attempts to continue with a policy of dominion over the planet rather than coming to terms with our place in it, as a part of the Earth System in which we must learn to live sustainably. 10 They are denials of the gravity and extent of the predicament. It is a delusion to see climate change as anything other than a total threat—not just to human life but to all life on the planet. To face the problem squarely, the present generation will have to overthrow the climate deniers of all stripes and institute a new global order capable of ending completely the combustion of fossil fuels, limiting the non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions and providing relief and mitigation for the effects of climate change that are on the way.
Climate change has already happened. It is not something that is coming in the future. Further changes that will happen in the next decades and into the coming centuries have already been baked into the climate. The increased carbon in the atmosphere since the industrial revolution, more than half of it produced in the last 30 years, has not only already warmed the planet 1°C but will continue to warm it even further if no more carbon is added because it can take approximately 40 years for the atmosphere to catch up to the heat energy absorbed in the ocean. 11 Because of this thermal inertia, our fossil fuel emissions today will continue to raise the atmospheric temperature into the 2060s even if we were to go to net zero immediately. 12
We are not used to dealing with events like this. We are much more familiar with simple contemporaneous cause and effect. Human social organization is now understood to be an essential component of the Earth System. It is responsible for the dire changes in the atmosphere that are warming the climate, heating up and acidifying the ocean, and depleting the biosphere. Just as future warming of the planet has already been baked in, so too has future change in human social organization. There is no way that the fossil fuel economy can exist in the future. There is no way that our present lifestyles of conspicuous consumption, air travel, internal combustion engines, air conditioning, etc.—all premised on carbon—will survive into the future. Either humans will reorganize their society and do away with fossil fuel combustion or the Earth System will do away with human society.
Capitalism was the driving force of the original conversion of the world’s energy system from sustainable sources—wind, water and the muscle power of humans and animals—to the extraction and combustion of buried carbon-based fossil fuels in the form of coal, petroleum, and natural gas. 13 It is the cause of the continuation of this process, which alone is responsible for increasing global warming and the current catastrophic climate crisis. There is a growing awareness of the complicity of capitalism in global warming. Some have suggested changing the term Anthropocene so as to point the blame to the particular form of human social organization responsible rather than to humans as a species. As Andreas Malm has said, “a more scientifically accurate designation, then, would be ‘the Capitalocene’. This is the geology not of mankind, but of capital accumulation.” 14
Capitalists are fighting against this awareness on two fronts. On the right, conservative think tanks and nationalist political parties, including the Republican Party, peddle false information about climate science, spreading doubt on the human causes of global warming while aligning this issue with other right-wing cultural causes like opposition to abortion, gun rights, and anti-immigration measures. These concerns are used to create a base of support for policies, like decreased corporate regulation and the privatization of the public sphere, that enrich the upper stratum and maintain power in the hands of a corporate elite who can perceive the threat to their very existence posed by the kinds of measures that would be needed to deal effectively with climate change.
On the left, those critical of capital’s hand in causing and furthering the climate crisis, are content to put the onus on unregulated capitalism. They deceive themselves into thinking that the problem stems solely from the greed and lack of morality of the wealthy corporate owners and managers. They insist that the system of profit derived from continuous growth can be reformed sufficiently to be able to contain further climate change while allowing for the continuation of our comfortable modern lives.
The measures called for in the Green New Deal are proposed as a model for the kind of changes needed to halt the slide to an uninhabitable planet and to institute equitable policies to redress the injustices served out to the innocent victims of the fossil fuel economy, including those affected by a transition to renewable energy. As radical as these reforms may seem to some, they pale before the transformations that will be required to avert the catastrophe. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez speaking on NPR admitted, “Even the solutions that we have considered big and bold are nowhere near the scale of the actual problem that climate change presents to us.” 15 It will take more than a New Deal to bring about the required transformation in energy use. Ultimately it will take a revolutionary change in the social system of the planet and the political structure that supports it. While it is true that we cannot wait for a socialist revolution to begin cutting emissions, we cannot rule out the possibility that the capitalist system is incapable of making the necessary reforms in time. Andreas Malm has argued that “the immutable arithmetic of climate change . . . tightens the screws on Marxists as much as on everyone else” and “at this moment in time, the purpose of an inquiry into the climatic destructivity of capitalist property relations can only be a realistic assessment of the obstacles to the transition.” 16 Christian Parenti, writing in Dissent magazine in the summer of 2013, acknowledged the fundamental conflict between the infinite growth of capitalism and the limits of a finite world but still felt that capitalism could institute reforms to solve the climate crisis in the same way it has dealt with specific public health issues in the past. Since he wrote that, however, carbon emissions have continued to grow each year and we are no closer to ending the fossil fuel economy. Meanwhile, the pain we are inflicting on this and future generations increases day by day. 17
The question then is this: can this society stop emitting CO2? Can the nations of the world convert to a totally renewable energy system by mid-century? Technically, it can be done. Mark Delucchi and Mark Jacobson, Berkeley and Stanford researchers respectively, have demonstrated that it is possible to transform the energy infrastructure of the world to all renewable energy, wind, water and solar by 2050 or earlier. They have worked out in minute detail how such a transition could be implemented in 139 countries of the world. Others, too, have shown how this is possible for different cities and regions. 18 Despite this, some climate scientists teach their students that it is not possible because, in the world as it is, demand for energy is accelerating, carbon emissions are increasing, and as a result we are headed to an unavoidable increase of 4℃ or even 6℃ above pre-industrial levels and we must prepare ourselves for such a world. 19 However, the fact that the present social use of energy is sending us into Hothouse Earth does not mean that it is impossible to avoid it. Unlike the immutable arithmetic of climate change, the arithmetic of human social organization can be altered by the conscious actions of its members.
Human social organization is the strength of the human species, not its weakness. Consciousness was the defining step in our evolution. It was an emergent trait arising out of the developing social interactions and cohesiveness of the earliest bands of hunter-gatherers. Individual consciousness is both a product of social/cultural development and a force in directing it. In the evolution of societies, greater conscious direction was a powerful development. Having one individual be the head of a hierarchical society allowed for conscious control over a greater number of subjects. The development of capitalism allowed for the emergence of a world-wide social organization in which individual consciousness was subsumed, not under the leadership of a hierarchical ruler but under the rules of a game in which individual welfare depended on ownership of property. This was a game that was ultimately beyond the control of conscious individuals, whose actions were channeled into directions determined by the expanding market economy. This arrangement has led among other things to greater cultural transfer and allowed for the fluorescence of science, which is nothing more than the enhanced consciousness of the universe that produced us and in which we live as a species. Capitalism has allowed for the integration of social interactions on a global scale but it functions as an unconscious process in which individual and social knowledge is constrained by the rules of the game we find ourselves playing. Human beings have the power to change the rules and to end the game before it ends us.
If the transformation we need to save ourselves, our species, and our fellow members of the biosphere is not possible within the current political economic system, then that system must be changed and that change may very well lie beyond the boundaries of capitalism. Capital must expand to create profit and make money. That is its function. As long as oil, gas, and coal continue to produce exorbitant profits that is where capital will flow. As long as the owners of capital continue to wield unparalleled power and influence over the governments of the world then any policies that conflict with their material interests will be stifled. When the welfare of all the world’s people is assumed to be totally dependent upon the continuing growth of the economy, the expansion of capital, and the accumulation of profit, any measure harmful to growth and profit will be deemed unacceptable, even, apparently, when that measure—the achieving of zero emissions—is indispensable to human survival.
A movement to halt global warming must force these boundaries, wrest control of governance from the hands of fossil capital, and establish a road to a sustainable future free from further greenhouse gas emissions and runaway climate change. It will take a widespread, militant, dedicated, and sustained social movement to demand the immediate conversion away from fossil fuels. It will require forcing an end to unsustainable capitalist practices and replacing them with a sustainable socialism that unites the people of the planet in the cause of mutual survival and assures an equitable and viable future for all. The crisis can only begin to be alleviated when the minds and the common effort of this entire generation are put to the service of the stewardship of the Earth and the benefit of humankind as a whole and no longer to that of capital and private gain. What needs to be done is clear. How to break through the impediments to achieving it is the difficult task at hand.

2020: Julin Castro on Immigration and Beyonce - Crooked Media,crooked.com,,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://crooked.com/podcast/2020-julian-castro-on-immigration-and-beyonce/,"Transcription below: Interview: Julian Castro and Tommy Vietor Tommy Vietor: [00:00:00] I am honored to have with me in the studio today, a former mayor of San Antonio, former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development: Julian Castro. Thank you so much for joining us. Julian Castro: [00:00:09] Thanks a lot. Great to be with you. Vietor: [00:00:12] So it’s been a weird week in the Trump world–I guess we say that every week basically–but I mean he threatened to seal the border with Mexico. He threatened to cut off aid to El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala. You rolled out a very very different and far less punitive and cruel immigration policy. You’ve proposed decriminalizing illegal entry into the U.S. and making it a civil infraction more like a speeding ticket than a crime. You want to split up ICE. You’ve proposed a Marshall Plan for Central America. Can you explain your immigration proposals and you know in particular what you can do on your own versus what Congress would have to act on? And talk about why you took such a bold approach. Castro: [00:00:55] Well I just have a different vision for this from the president. If you’ll remember about a year ago his administration told us basically that if we would just be cruel enough to separate little children from their parents that that would deter more families from coming to the United States. And in fact more families are coming now. And so he wants us to believe that in order to have a secure border we need to choose cruelty. I believe that we have a border that is more secure than it’s ever been. And I’m asking Americans to choose compassion so this people first immigration plan that I rolled out includes rolling back something called Section 13.25 on the Immigration and Nationality Act which as you know was put in place in the late 1920s but until about 2004 these infractions–somebody crossing over the border–was actually treated mostly as a civil matter. It wasn’t treated as a criminal matter. I believe that we should go back to that, that it will help us undo the backlog that exists of people. Folks have been watching these images of people under the bridge in El Paso that are literally fenced in with razor wire. This family detention practice of separating little children from their parents. That’s all part of this incarceration push in our immigration policy. I think that we need to do away with that. I also believe that we need to increase the number of refugees that this country takes in. I think that we need to stop playing games with people who are seeking asylum in this country, stop treating them like criminals and allow them to make their claim. I saw the president today suggest that we should somehow do away with asylum and also do away with immigration judges. Actually, I believe that we should strengthen our immigration judicial system and make it independent and invest in it so that we can actually process these claims. I mean the fact of the matter is we know that many of the people who make an asylum claim in the United States may not get asylum. Also, under my plan of course we maintain the power to deport people but we don’t treat them like criminals and we don’t act like this is just going to go away. I also proposed basically a 21st Century Marshall Plan for Latin America. I know that you can’t compare this the Latin America of today with post-World War two Europe. Right. I mean Europe was coming back after the war. But what I mean is that I believe that we need to make investments in these northern triangle countries in Honduras and El Salvador and Guatemala so that people can find safety and opportunity there instead of having to knock on the door of the United States. And so they win and we win. Vietor: [00:03:47] I love that you are taking a big bold approach on immigration policy. I think that Democrats need to go at Trump hard on immigration because if you look at the facts, he’s a failure, right? He’s failed on enforcement. He’s failed when it comes to living up to our values. He’s not gotten the job done. But I also know, you know just from mostly time in the White House, that some of these policies are tough politically and some of them you’ve proposed like splitting up ICE, decriminalizing illegal entry, the foreign aid– if those require congressional action and in some instances are an unpopular, how do you propose to sell that? I mean how can we get voters to understand that more money for foreign aid is actually going to help them in the long run? Castro: [00:04:37] Well I mean the fact is that as you know the United States every single year invests in the relationships that we have around the world with aid to many countries. And so I do think that there is a backbone in our history of some built-in support, some realization of that. You’re right. I mean we do have to convince people why it would make sense and I would very much lead that with an explanation of how much we’re going to spend, how much it would cost to build that wall versus to invest less–what would be less dollars in these northern triangle countries–and I think to stem the tide, stem the flow of people coming over here. So just on a numbers basis… Vietor: [00:05:17] Do you have a ballpark number? Castro: [00:05:17] No I don’t. But, you know, I anticipate that that would be our approach. And you know during the course of the campaign we look forward to getting specific about that. But the other thing is that, you know, I think that on January 20th 2021 at 12:01p.m, we’re going to have a Democratic president, a Democratic Senate, and a Democratic House. And one of the lessons on immigration reform of 2009 and 2010 is ‘don’t wait.’ And so you know, we’re gonna go for that. Vietor: [00:05:53] A lot of candidates announced that they’re going to run for president and then they catch the first plane to Iowa. You went to Puerto Rico. Why do you do that? Castro: [00:06:01] I went to Puerto Rico because I wanted them and all Americans to know that if I’m president that everybody counts in this country. This administration has failed the people of Puerto Rico. Just recently he lied that ninety-one-billion dollars had been invested in Puerto Rico to recover from Hurricane Maria. The truth is that that’s just over 11 billion dollars. And I wanted to just tell them, you know, we’re thinking about them. They’re Americans too. And if I’m president I think, frankly if any of the folks that are running for president as Democrats make it, that we’re going to treat them very differently. We’re going to make sure that they count. Vietor: [00:06:42] Do you the theory for why he is so vicious towards elected officials…any financing going towards Puerto Rico? It’s glaring it’s nasty. Castro: [00:06:54] It’s insecurity. He recognizes that it’s another example of the administration’s either malice or incompetence. See, I don’t think that his incompetence is given enough credit, a lot of times. It’s an incompetent administration full of people who are C or D level appointees–not all of them but a lot of them–I mean you served in the federal government. You know what I’m talking about. A lot of positions that are unfilled. A lot of decisions that don’t get made because people are afraid to make a decision because there are gaps in the chain of command and political decisions that get made. So he wants people to believe that it was Puerto Rico’s fault from the very beginning when they suggested that somehow you know people were on strike and so they didn’t help deliver supplies on the island. He riles up his base by making them think it’s Puerto Rico’s fault when it wasn’t and shifts the conversation to that instead of the fact that that Harvard study pointed out that about three point three thousand people died and a lot of them [died] after the storm hit because the recovery was not handled the right way. Vietor: [00:08:03] Yeah. ‘Puerto Ricans are known to create their own hurricanes,’ I think is his take on this. Do you think Puerto Rico should become a state? Castro: [00:08:11] Well I think that they should, that they should determine that. I know that there have been a couple of votes in years past. I would like to see a process for self-determination. I would be committed to that if I’m president. I think that they should be respected first and foremost and they’ve been completely disrespected by this president. I mean I, I cannot believe how disrespectful this president has been. Vietor: [00:08:39] Nor can I. So you were President Obama’s secretary of Housing and Urban Development from 2014 to 2017. The financial crisis and a lot of the fallout from it was before your time and in many instances–but there are some Democrats who believe that Obama didn’t do enough to help homeowners hurt by the financial crisis, but he bailed out banks. It’s something you hear a lot. So for example they think we should have let bankruptcy judges modify homeowner mortgages to reduce the terms, reduce the value of the debt, and avoid foreclosure. It’s called a “cramdown” down. It’s one of those awful terms that I will never forget and no one knows what it means. Do you agree with that criticism and if you do, what are the things you think we could have done to help homeowners after the crisis? Castro: [00:09:23] Well what I believe is that President Obama did a very good job with the circumstances that he inherited. In terms of getting the country back up on its feet–you think about communities like Florida or Nevada that were very hard hit. It was night and day, you know, if you stepped in there in January of 2009 versus January of 2017. At the same time of course there are lessons learned. Hopefully we won’t have to go through that again. Lessons learned in terms of maybe we can be more aggressive and so that more people can keep their homes. But overall I do think that the administration was focused on the concerns of everyday people especially in a way that this president just is not. You folks may remember right after he was elected, you know, somebody caught him I think on tape or a reporter that Trump told his buddies at one of his clubs you know, “I’m going to get you that tax cut. I gonna lower your taxes.” I mean that’s completely different from the the attitude that President Obama had and all of us had which is: we want to do what we can to to improve the lives of everyday Americans that are working hard and have just lost their homes. I think in the future we can look at more aggressive ways to make sure people can keep their homes. Also to add to housing supply that is affordable because we have a rental affordability crisis out there and on the stump these days I talk a lot about that. You know one of the things I talk about is that we need to be the most prosperous nation in this 21st century but it has to mean prosperity for *everybody,* from raising the minimum wage to investing in affordable housing to making sure that of course we focus on the middle class but also that we focus on the poor, too. Vietor: [00:11:20] Yeah I mean look, I’ve lived recently in D.C., LA, San Francisco– I mean these are cities where rents are just skyrocketing. Castro: [00:11:27] Man, you really hit the hotspots of expensive places. Vietor: [00:11:28] Yeah…Not the smartest move on my part. I wasn’t a tech founder. So I mean like these cities I mean their gentrification, people are getting driven out of their homes, what role do you think the federal government can play in helping people afford housing versus state and local government? Castro: [00:11:47] There are things that we can do. You know at the end of the Obama administration one of the things we did was to release a set of recommendations for local communities on land-use decisions that they could make. Basically to increase the likelihood that affordable housing would be built, that we get greater supply but we can make stronger investments. I would increase the National Housing Trust Fund, increase low income housing tax credits, also traditional tools like community development block grants and home funding and money to combat homelessness because we have, in these cities that you mentioned, right, growing unsheltered homelessness. But we also I think have to restore something called Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing. It was a blockbuster rule that HUD did during the Obama administration to basically tell communities, “look if you’re going to get federal taxpayer dollars through HUD you have to get more serious about providing equal housing opportunity throughout your jurisdiction.” And that I think will help jurisdictions cities or counties be wiser, be more prudent about things like gentrification and displacement. I have to tell you that I traveled to 100 different communities in thirty-nine states when I was HUD secretary over those two and a half years. And I would not have created a single community with an A when it came to combating displacement because oftentimes what happens is by the time people recognize there’s a problem here, you know, there’s already gone through a tipping point and people can’t afford to live there anymore. Austin is a great example of that. You know the east side of Austin has lost half of its African-American population over the last decade or so. So there is a lot of their investments. But there’s also I think an approach that we can take to help local communities get better about that. Vietor: [00:13:46] Switching gears a little bit but I guess staying in San Francisco, there’s some polling out today about how unpopular some of the big tech companies are like Facebook, Google, Twitter. There’s been a lot of talk recently about how they should be regulated or maybe even broken up. Do you think it makes sense to break up companies like Facebook or Google? And if yes, I mean, do we need to update our antitrust laws to reflect the reality of business today versus, say, the Standard Oil in the 20s? Castro: [00:14:13] Oh I think it’s definitely worth taking a look at those laws. I believe that that’s worth a debate, a conversation. I have concerns about for instance companies that have gotten as big as they have with a business model of using consumer information, using the web data cell phone data you know tracking data of ordinary Americans. I do think–I was in Iowa the other day, we did a forum in Storm Lake around rural issues and one of things I said there was, with respect to agribusiness for instance, that I applaud efforts to not just look at consumer price when two companies are trying to merge in agribusiness but also looking at the effect on small business along the chain of production. And I think, you know, analogously that we can say that in the same way about tech or other industries. So yeah I think that that’s worth a debate. Vietor: [00:15:13] During the campaign President Trump had some donors lobbyists the Federal Society draw up for him a list of potential Supreme Court justices that he could then release to show his conservative bona fides. Do you have a list. And do you want to share any names with us today. Castro: [00:15:30] I don’t have a list. But let me tell you what I would do: Number one, we need to bring back respected organizations like the American Bar Association to give input and make recommendations and take those recommendations seriously. Secondly, I know the importance of the Supreme Court to fundamental rights like the right to choose and that the future of Roe v. Wade is under threat because of the direction that the court has been going in. And if I’m president I’m going to make sure to appoint very well qualified judges who have a good track record and have embraced progressive values. Vietor: [00:16:07] I mean so, just this week Mitch McConnell is forcing through a rule change that that reduces the amount of time you have to debate one of these judges and cloture from 30 hours to two. So they are just ramming these–they’re finding like anybody over the age of 13 maybe taking the Lsat… Castro: [00:16:25] No you’re not kidding in some instances. Yeah. Vietor: [00:16:28] Unfortunately I’m not. I mean can we fix this? Are they stacking the federal courts to such a degree that the next Democratic president might not be able to unwind the damage? Castro: [00:16:40] Well I mean there’s gonna be a lot of damage no doubt because they’re appointing ideologues, because some of these ideologues as you suggest are hardly qualified. I mean there are a couple I think that hadn’t even argued a case, had not litigated a case and now they’re gonna be Supreme Court justices that go into the intricacies essentially of the law. So people have discussed different ways that we could look at it. There’s one that I am not too fond of and you know maybe a couple that I would consider. The one that I’m not too fond of is just simply increasing the number of justices on the Supreme Court because if we go from nine justices to eleven tomorrow what’s to say that in a couple of years they don’t come back and put it back in nine or 15? The ones that intrigued me more for instance are term limits on what are now lifetime appointments. If you had a 20 year term limit or something like that or some system that’s akin to how some states do commission redistricting. Right. The Democrats appoint certain people the Republicans appoint a certain number of people and then you have to agree on a certain number of people. So those tend to be more in the middle. I think that that’s worth looking at. Vietor: [00:17:57] A couple political questions for you. So in the 2018 midterms Democrats obviously had a lot of success. And we made some progress among Latino voters. But I think there’s a lot less than than people at hope especially in places like Florida. Similarly I think you’ve seen general Latino political participation not keep pace with Latino population growth. I’m curious if you have a theory of the case for why that is and thoughts on how Democrats could do a better job of earning the votes of Latinos in the US? Castro: [00:18:28] Well I mean I think different reasons. What can we do to improve that. It’s going to take an all out three hundred and sixty five day a year effort to invest in registration and in turn out. As you know, I mean campaigns are often focused on the most likely voters because they have limited resources. So this is something that foundations and C-4s and others are gonna have to do a year round not just three months before an election or six months before an election. But if you have a sustained effort to improve turnout, registration and turnout then I do think that you can start seeing those numbers improve. We did see you know from 2014 to 2018 over one hundred and fifty percent increase in Latino participation at least in Texas. So you know there is some reason for hope. I do think that in 2020 we’re going to see an increase. I believe also that you have to continue to recruit good candidates from the local level, the state level, and at the federal level. You know as a candidate I’ve always been mindful that you need to represent everybody when you’re, if you’re in office and as you campaign. But I do believe that my candidacy, as the only Latino that’s running in this race, is going to have special meaning to a lot of Latinos. And I believe that if I’m the Democratic nominee that I can go get the eleven electoral votes of Arizona, the twenty 29 electoral votes of Florida and the 30 electoral votes of Texas. Tommy: [00:20:01] Something you said reminded me of something that literally keeps me up at night which is that Trump is out there–he’s gonna raise a billion dollars, he’s putting millions of dollars into Facebook ads to scare the shit out of all white people in various places like it every day. And Democrats, we are going to spend a couple hundred million dollars in Iowa, South Carolina, New Hampshire. You know maybe some Super Tuesday states. Does that worry you that we’re not doing this structural investing that you talked about or do you think the DNC is filling that gap? Castro: [00:20:33] Well I mean I’ll give Tom Bettis some credit. Right. I mean I do think that he has given that thought, in addition to addressing some of the 2016 issues of Bernie/ Hillary stuff, divisions and feelings that we’re still there. But I do think that they’ve taken, a you know, eyes wide open approach now but it’s going to take, you know the Democracy Alliance and others that are interested in long term growth in registration and turnout to make those investments. We can’t take our eye off of that ball. I do agree that, look, the first order of business is to go get Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania. I mean we lost those by collectively less than 80,000 votes. And I think that a couple of the trends we saw in 2018 like the suburbs, going over to Democrats and, as you know, President Obama in 2012, there was an African American turnout rate of 66 percent and that fell to fifty-nine and a half percent in 2016. I think that that’s going to go up again. Right. Whether I’m the nominee or there are others that can I think make that go up again. So there’s a lot of promise there. But on top of that the future is to go get Arizona, Texas and Florida. Kirsten Sinema already won in Arizona. Gillum only lost by, in a midterm year, only lost by 33,000 votes. Vietor: [00:21:57] Heartbreaker. Castro: [00:21:57] They were but you know I mean a presidential year has got to be better than a midterm year probably for us. But you know Bill Nelson only lost by 10,000 and in Texas you know Betto O’Rourke got within two and a half points of Ted Cruz. So there’s a lot to suggest that that’s fruitful territory for us. Vietor: [00:22:15] Yeah I mean look Betto turned out a lot of voters but he was also running against like arguably the worst person on the planet. I mean do you think, do you think Texas is gettable in an election year? We’ve been salivating over Texas for a decade, Democrats have. Castro: [00:22:32] Oh I do it I do. You know a good example of that was that Hillary lost Texas by nine points. Right. She lost Ohio and Iowa by nine points. But for Texas it had gone from a 16 point difference to a nine point difference. And now in the midterms there were a couple of candidates not only Congressman O’Rourke but also the lieutenant gubernatorial candidate Mike Collier who were within three points. So for 2020 I believe with the right candidate that yeah we can get it. I believe that if I’m the nominee that I can get Texas. Vietor: [00:23:10] Speaking of the nominee so there’s roughly a thousand Democrats running for president. I can’t imagine how difficult–I mean I remember running against Hillary and thinking it was hard to break through–I can’t imagine how it is now especially with, there’s thresholds one has to meet to be invited to the debates. Right. And you, you warned supporters in a fundraising e-mail that the party’s new rules mean you might not make it onto the debate stage. So I guess my question is: What’s your pitch to listeners to say “give me a buck so I can get on that stage” and how do you hope to break through and then, because I love 15 part questions like: Is your path Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada South Carolina, or do you think you might prioritize your time differently? Vietor: [00:23:47] Well you know I announced on January 12 that unlike some of the candidates I had not run for president before, haddn’t run for Senate. Even though I’ve served as a federal executive, a National Post. So we’re building up our campaign from scratch. Our fundraising has accelerated tremendously. I’m still not at the 65,000 threshold and so we’re taking contributions to get on that debate stage. I have met the polling requirement though. And why? Well number one I’m one of the few candidates in this race that has executive experience. Having served as a cabinet secretary, managed an agency of 48 billion dollar budget, eight thousand employees, 54 field offices across the country, also served as the mayor of San Antonio, the nation’s seventh largest city. So I have a track record of getting things done. And I represent a new generation of leadership and I think that people are looking for a new generation of leadership. I’ve also articulated a strong positive compelling vision for the future that we be in the 21st century the smartest, the healthiest, the fairest, and the most prosperous nation. And in releasing plans on how we get there like we did with this people first immigration plan. So yeah I believe that with the support of the American people that I am going to get on the debate stage and I would encourage folks to give. Once we get on that debate stage I’m confident that I’m going to stand out in terms of my path. I think everybody’s got to compete for Iowa because in such a crowded field you, you know if you get lost in the shuffle, if you don’t do very well there then it’s probably hard to to stick around. So I’m going to compete in Iowa. I also like that we have Nevada as the third state. After those first four states I actually really like the secondary stretch of states on Super Tuesday March 3rd. We have California, we have Texas. We have I believe Colorado as well as the South. Puerto Rico I understand is looking at moving up its primary to Sunday March 8 and then after that within two weeks or so you have Florida and Arizona. And so I feel good very good about that secondary stretch of state. Vietor: [00:25:59] So let’s fast forward a little bit. You won. Congrats. You walk into the Oval. Put your feet up on the desk. What do you do on day one? Castro: [00:26:09] Well that moment will be a very special one, I actually look forward to. Let me back up a few hours. I look forward to the moment when it’s traditional for the incoming president to usher out the outgoing president. And you know on the White House lawn Donald Trump and Melania Trump will be ready to go off to New York or to Mar a Lago or somewhere. Vietor: [00:26:29] Right Moscow. Castro: [00:26:32] Right before he leaves to go off into the helicopter I’m going to tell him Adios. So when I get into the Oval office, my first executive order will be to recommit the United States to the Paris climate accord so that we can lead on climate change again and also–And I think this reflects the experience that I do have, having served as a cabinet member–as you know this administration has undertaken a number of different rule changes that have undermined civil rights, women’s rights, the environment, health care, education, any number of things. My first order of business will be to have a catalogue of that, an index of that, immediately on the first day and the days following that to instruct, what will at that point be temporary people in charge of the departments, to begin undoing those things that have been done and to go in the right direction on civil rights and education and health care. We got to go back in the direction of expanding opportunity instead of taking away from it. Vietor: [00:27:37] Yeah agreed. I’ll ask you a couple of national security questions: so there’s been this very frightening increase, globally, in terrorist attacks by white nationalists. Most recently there was a lunatic who shot up two mosques in New Zealand. The New York Times this week published an interesting analysis showing that many of these attacks are actually connected either by direct communication between individuals involved or one was inspired by another. I’m curious what you think about what the U.S. government and also tech companies should do to stop online radicalization and the horrific violence that can come from it. Castro: [00:28:14] Well we have seen that there’s this underworld out there in the Internet and social media where people are getting radicalized, right. That’s often a word unfortunately that has only been used when we talk about folks in the Middle East. Muslims, people groups, whole groups have been slandered but it is accurate to say that several of these young men who have gone in and shot up whether it’s a church or nightclub or other circumstances here and also in other parts of the world have been radicalized. And so I do think that whether it’s Facebook or Twitter or others that they have to bear some responsibility for cracking down on that. Be more vigilant. And they’ve said that, right. And in some instances they’ve taken steps. But I don’t think that they’ve done enough. I think it was the FBI director that may have testified recently that this White Nationalism is a real threat. And we see that, right. I also, though, I do think that we have to be careful because the president and others would have people almost believe that every time somebody who happens to be Muslim commits a terrorist act that we should view all people in that way. And you know we don’t do that just like if somebody is white and they go and, if you have a white man that goes and shoots up a church or somewhere else, we don’t make those kinds of conclusions. We have to combat these challenges where they are right and do so in a way that separates the actions of one individual from an indictment of entire groups. Vietor: [00:29:54] Do you think Trump has, I don’t know, inspired these groups or made common cause with some of the fringe-ier nationalist groups out there? Castro: [00:30:04] Yeah I think it’s fair to say they’ve gotten inspiration from him. Yeah no doubt. And that from what I can tell there have been moments where he seems to either encourage or knowingly does not discourage these beliefs. I’m thinking of after Charlottesville. You know the very fine people. And yeah. He’ll make a comment that this is wrong, it’s the wrong thing, but it’s never as fervent as he does when you know it’s somebody of a different faith. Vietor: [00:30:38] Yeah. Yeah. A person of color. Castro: [00:30:41] Or different religion especially incidents in France or Europe or other places where you happen to have had someone who is Muslim commit one of these attacks and he’s all over that. In the strongest terms but we’ll not do that when it’s one of these white nationalists. Tommy: [00:30:59] Agreed. It’s been about six months I believe since the Saudis brutally executed and dismembered a journalist named Jamal Khashoggi at their consulate in Istanbul. This week Congress voted to end U.S. involvement in the Saudi-led war in Yemen that has put literally 20 million innocent people at risk of starvation. This week we also learned that the Saudis are about to complete construction on their first nuclear reactor. But they have yet to agree to any international rules that would ensure that that technology is used for civilian purposes and not for weapons. Given the trajectory of the relationship and what we know of Mohammad bin Salman do you think the Saudis are still our ally? Castro: [00:31:40] That is a very good question and you know frankly I think that the Obama administration began to take a new look at that relationship. It’s also troubling. What we continue to find out about the relationship between the president’s family and the Saudi royal family. And so you know I acknowledge here that I’m not privy to classified information. I don’t know what other information there is or how helpful they may have been. But right now I would say that it certainly raises the question. And it’s alarming that Saudi Arabia would be progressing toward nuclear capacity in this way. And there seems to be little accountability right now. Vietor: [00:32:29] Yeah I’m just imagining if Iran butchered a journalist who lives in the US and then we found that they were building a nuclear reactor. I think we probably would have invaded five minutes ago. You know, it’s just it’s a remarkable double standard. And there’s just this inertia in Washington I think that keeps us from rethinking these relationships and I’m not totally sure why. Castro: [00:32:51] Well and that’s why you know you wonder is there something else there that we’re not getting of value. I mean that’s the question that I have as somebody right now that is not privy to that that kind of information. But what I can say is that that there march toward nuclear capacity or capability does trouble me given other circumstances that I’ve seen. Vietor: [00:33:14] So as we speak the Chinese government is undertaking what is likely the largest mass detention of a racial or religious group since the Holocaust. Experts estimate that at least one million workers who are a Muslim minority group are being held, in I guess you’d call them reeducation camps. They’re forced to renounce their religion, learn Chinese Communist Party propaganda. Some are reportedly being tortured. And I’m just struck by the fact that the world is largely silent on it. And that includes allies of ours like the U.K. I don’t know that there’s an easy answer here but do you have a sense of what the U.S. should do to push them on this massive human rights violation or is it an atrocity in plain sight? Castro: [00:33:55] Well I think that should be part of any agreements that we forge with China and our continued diplomatic relationship with them. I’m somebody that still believes that the United States has a role to play in leading the world on what we care about: freedom, democracy, opportunity, and that even though this administration has scaled back in a big way on its leadership on human rights abuses we actually need to restore that. So I would find every single way that we can to apply pressure to China on this and not only China but other countries around the world. We just saw what happened with the Sultan of Brunei, for instants right. And you were in Los Angeles today. I mean there’s a boycott of one of his hotels over here. Right. That he has an interest in. Vietor: [00:34:44] George Clooney writes one op ed and we’re boycott boycotting a bunch of hotels. Castro: [00:34:47] Yeah. Yeah but I mean the fact is–that ain’t the way it’s supposed to work either right? So one of the things that we need to restore is a strong voice of leadership on human rights abuses. Vietor: [00:35:03] So President Trump has had this long back and forth with Kim Jong Un in North Korea. He had this summit that he thinks is historic in Singapore where they–you know he came back and told us that there was no longer a nuclear threat from North Korea and that everything was solved. That’s obviously not true. The negotiations seem to have fallen apart. But as someone who worked in government for a while and the NSC and saw, particularly in the first term, the way inertia in DC conventional wisdom can hamstring a president, I was kind of impressed by Trump saying “fuck you guys I want to meet with him. Who cares. What’s the downside.” I mean I guess I’m just curious what you make of that diplomatic effort. And if you’ve thought about why sometimes in Washington it seems so much harder to make peace and have talks than it is to go to war? Castro: [00:35:58] I remember you know how much, then candidate Obama got pilloried right for saying that he would speak with people who were our quote unquote enemies without preconditions and so forth and you know what we see here with with Trump may be a kind of a Nixon in China example, a smaller scale of it, where because he’s seen as a tough guy on these issues, in some ways he can get away with war but it shouldn’t be like that. Because the principle of being able to try and negotiate peace should apply no matter who you are because it’s in the nation’s best interest. So yes I do think that that’s an approach that we should take. I also see that frankly, as for me, I’m not part and parcel of Washington. You know I spent two and a half years there. I think sometimes folks that spend more time in Washington, right, the more you’re influenced by the thinking of elite Washington. We shouldn’t let that hamper how we go forward. Of course what we’ve seen unfold in front of our eyes is that it seems like this president got played. In fact misled the American people about what was happening with these talks and maybe most disappointingly you know just from a executive perspective he does not seem to have the discipline or the energy to put the time in to understand the issues well enough to be prepared. One thing that you knew about President Obama is that he studied those books you know and he respected the people that were advising him. This president thinks that he can wing everything and know there’s no doubt of course that he must have some talents. He wouldn’t be where he is without it. But he just seems completely in over his head and because of that now they’re actually going back and probably their breakout capacity is getting smaller and smaller, shorter and shorter. So we’re we’re miss-served by a president that is too busy insulting people on Twitter or playing golf or going to Mar a Lago instead of putting the time in to actually you know get us the kind of deal that we need. Vietor: [00:38:09] Yeah. Low energy. They probably made a few more nukes on his watch. Final question for you. So whenever someone famous comes into our office and gets asked about Beyonce, it gets picked up literally everywhere. So… Castro: [00:38:24] Didn’t she like, strike up a deal with Adidas yesterday? Vietor: [00:38:27] Tell me about it. Castro: [00:38:28] Yeah well I don’t know a lot about it. I just saw the headlines, right. Vietor: [00:38:31] She’s a Texan, right? Castro: [00:38:32] She is, Houston. Vietor: [00:38:33] She didn’t endorse? Castro: [00:38:35] I don’t know. Well, if she does, I hope she endorses me. Vietor: [00:38:37] OK. There we go. Beyoncé might endorse Secretary Castro. That’s your headline out of this. Secratary thank so much for coming in. It’s a pleasure talking to you and good luck. Castro: [00:38:46] Hey thanks a lot. Sign Up. What the hell do you have to lose? Sign me up"
Gitmo dilemma: Force-feeding violates international law | MSNBC,www.msnbc.com,,04-07-2019,2019,4,http://www.msnbc.com/up-with-steve-kornacki/gitmo-dilemma-force-feeding-violates-interna,"Gitmo dilemma: Force-feeding violates international law 05/03/13 08:37 PM  Updated 09/13/13 08:47 AM By Geoffrey Cowley File Photo: U.S. Navy guards escort a detainee after a ""life skills"" class at Camp 6 in the Guantanamo Bay detention center on March 30, 2010 John Moore/Getty Images, File As a legal scholar who once campaigned against the Bush administration’s human rights abuses, President Obama surely knows the international rules on the treatment of prisoners. If so, he didn’t let on during his press conference this week. When a reporter questioned the administration’s use of forced feeding to put down the current hunger strike at Guantanamo Bay, the president had only seven words to offer: “I don’t want these individuals to die.”
A noble intention, to be sure, but his response skirted an issue that warrants closer scrutiny. Force-feeding prisoners violates longstanding international conventions. Medical societies, legal societies, international relief organizations and United Nations officials are all calling on the Pentagon to stop the practice, and some human rights advocates are demanding sanctions against health professionals who take part. But beyond the president’s cryptic reply, the administration has yet to explain its reasoning.
Obama didn’t create this mess. He came to office promising to close the prison camp, but Congress blocked every exit. More than four years later, 166 prisoners still languish there. Many were swept up by U.S. forces in the aftermath of 9/11 and the early days of the Iraq war and have been held without charges ever since. Several have died violently during their detention. Others have attempted suicide in what their lawyers describe as a “pit of hopelessness.” As the president said this week, “The notion that we’re going to keep over a hundred individuals in a no man’s land in perpetuity is contrary to who we are, it is contrary to our interests, and it needs to stop.”
But while the administration struggles to re-engage Congress, the prisoners’ despair is becoming a humanitarian emergency. Over the past three months, 100 of the 166 detainees have joined a hunger strike to protest their harsh confinement and the lack of legal recourse. Instead of trying to address their grievances, the Pentagon has flown 40 medics to Guantanamo to nourish them by force. On April 30, The New York Times reported that the Pentagon had “approved” 21 of the hunger strikers for “enteral feeding.”
That procedure, which the Bush administration used repeatedly to quash Guantanamo hunger strikes, is excruciating even when performed on a willing patient. “Some patients may scream and gasp as the tube is introduced,” New York City physician Kent Sepkowitz wrote in a Daily Beast essay this week. “The tear ducts well up and overflow; the urge to sneeze or cough or vomit is often uncontrollable. A paper cup of water with a bent straw is placed before the frantic and miserable patient and all present implore him to Sip! Sip! in hopes of facilitating tube passage past the glottis and into the esophagus and stomach.”
“The procedure is, in a word, barbaric,” Sepkowitz writes. “And that’s when we are trying to be nice.”
By forcibly intubating a resistant prisoner, military officials can easily pump liquid calories into his digestive system. But it’s a delicate procedure when performed on someone who has been fasting. As Boston University physicians explained in a 2007 JAMA article on forced feeding, the sudden replenishment can cause hyperglycemia, severe fluid retention and a dangerous depletion of phosphate in the blood—a cluster of symptoms known as refeeding syndrome. “Repeated insertions of the feeding tube … also can lead to mechanical complications,” the experts wrote, “such as … nasopharyngeal or esophageal trauma and, rarely, esophageal perforation.”
Many medical treatments are harsh, demeaning and risky. That’s why physicians around the world vow never to perform them on a competent patient who declines. The 1948 Geneva conventions explicitly prohibit the “cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment” of prisoners—and medical authorities have repeatedly affirmed that forced feeding crosses that line. “Forcible feeding is never ethically acceptable,” the World Medical Association states in its most recent (2006) declaration on the issue. “Even if intended to benefit, feeding accompanied by threats, coercion, force or use of physical restraints is a form of inhuman and degrading treatment.”
Over the past week, the International Committee of the Red Cross , the United Nations human rights office , the American Medical Association , and a broad coalition of legal, medical and religious societies have all affirmed that judgment, calling on the administration to address the Guantanamo prisoners’ desperation without flouting medical ethics or international law. “The forced feeding of detainees violates core ethical values of the medical profession,” AMA president Jeremy Lazarus writes in an April 25 letter to Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel. “Every competent patient has the right to refuse medical intervention, including life-sustaining interventions.”
How does the administration respond to all of this? Has the Pentagon decided that international law actually permits the forced feeding of competent prisoners? Has it found the hunger strikers incompetent to voluntarily refuse treatment? Or is it consciously defying global conventions because it disagrees with them? The White House didn’t respond Friday to a request for clarification.
Policymakers are not the only ones with serious questions to address. Medical professionals are ethically bound to honor patients’ rights, even if it means defying government orders. Dr. Steven Miles of the University of Minnesota’s Center for Bioethics notes that physicians in eight countries have been disciplined or prosecuted since the 1970s for abetting official human rights abuses .
One of the first was Dr. Benjamin Tucker, a South African physician who was barred from the profession for his role in the mistreatment of anti-apartheid activist Steve Biko. “There are strong parallels between the Biko case and the ongoing role of US military doctors in Guantanamo Bay and the War on Terror,” Miles and 265 other physicians wrote in a 2007 letter published in the Lancet . “[But] no health care worker in the War on Terror has been charged or convicted of any significant offense despite numerous instances documented … The attitude of the US medical establishment appears to be one of “See no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil.’”
With its open letter to the Pentagon, the AMA has shown that it dares to speak out. Will the group match words with deeds, by censuring doctors who “violate core ethical values of the medical profession”? Like the White House, the AMA went silent when msnbc posed that question on Friday. But the question isn’t going away.

Virginia House delegation splits on party lines on revamped Violence Against Women Act,www.virginiamercury.com,Robin Bravender,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/04/05/virginia-house-delegation-splits-on-revamped-violence-against-women-act/,"Virginia House delegation splits on party lines on revamped Violence Against Women Act By Email The U.S. Capitol. (Credit: Toni Smith, USGS. Public domain
WASHINGTON — The U.S. House on Thursday voted to renew and expand legislation that aids victims of domestic violence, setting the stage for a battle in the Senate.
House lawmakers voted 263-158 to reauthorize the 1994 legislation that funds programs like rape crisis centers, shelters and legal services to victims of domestic abuse. House Democrats were joined by 33 Republicans in approving the measure. The vote among Virginia representatives , however, was split along party lines, with Democrats voting yes (except for Rep. Don McEachin, D-4th, who did not vote) and Republicans opposed.
The domestic violence law expired in February, and advocates warn that critical programs will be in jeopardy if it’s not renewed. U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger, D-7th, said the funded programs “are all around us, serving Americans in every state & from every walk of life.” #VAWA -supported resources are all around us, serving Americans in every state & from every walk of life. The list above is only a small portion of the programs & protections the law extends to victims of domestic and sexual violence, & I am proud to support reauthorizing #VAWA19 .
— Rep. Abigail Spanberger (@RepSpanberger) April 4, 2019
U.S. Rep. Ben Cline, R-6th, said Democrats chose “to add several unacceptable provisions” to the bill.
“While I support the reauthorization of VAWA, I could not vote for their version,” he said. “Instead, I supported and voted for the re-enactment of the most recent version of the VAWA law while we continue working to negotiate a bipartisan solution.
The law has long had bipartisan support, but it has become contentious this Congress as newly empowered House Democrats are seeking to expand the measure. The National Rifle Association is opposing a provision in the bill from Rep. Debbie Dingell, D-Mich., that makes it easier to keep guns from those convicted of domestic abuse or stalking.
The issue is personal for Dingell. “This is something that I care very, very deeply about, because I lived in that household,” she told reporters outside the U.S. Capitol earlier this week. Dingell has publicly recounted how she hid in a closet from her father, who suffered from mental illness.
“I know what it’s like to live in a household with someone that has issues that can snap at a minute’s notice, and suddenly the gun is pointed at your mother or pointed at you. And as a child, you’re trying to grab a gun from someone and keep them from killing each other.”
But the NRA has called the new gun enforcement language a “poison pill,” arguing that it’s too broad and threatens the rights of gun owners.
Speaking on the House floor ahead of the vote on Thursday, Dingell implored her colleagues, “Do not let the NRA bully you. This is not a poison pill.”
The House bill has the backing of Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Pa., who was an original co-sponsor.
“This is not a partisan issue which is why I put a special emphasis on working to build bipartisan support for this critical legislation,” Fitzpatrick said in a statement.
Still, most House Republicans voted against the measure on Thursday, signaling an uphill battle in the GOP-controlled Senate. Republican leadership sought a “clean extension” of the law earlier this year, but Democrats rejected that in hopes of expanding the bill.
Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), a 2020 presidential contender is leading an effort in the Senate to bar people who have been convicted of stalking or abusing dating partners from owning guns.
Klobuchar said at a press conference Wednesday that she’ll be lobbying GOP senators who have quietly expressed support for similar efforts in past years.
“They didn’t want to have their name on the bill, but they would have voted for it,” she said. “That’s a group I’m focusing on.”"
‘The Haunting of Sharon Tate’: Inside the Crazy Hilary Duff Movie That Desecrates the Dead,www.thedailybeast.com,amy.zimmerman@thedailybeast.com (Amy Zimmerman),04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-haunting-of-sharon-tate-inside-the-crazy-hilary-duff-movie-that-desecrates-the-dead,"‘The Haunting of Sharon Tate’: Inside the Crazy Hilary Duff Movie That Desecrates the Dead There are no words. But we’re going to try. [Warning: Spoilers] 04.07.19 3:01 AM ET Saban Films
The Haunting of Sharon Tate is a movie about fate. Tate, played by Hilary Duff, is kept awake at night by visions of her impending death. Just like the Haunting audience, Tate knows that her murder is inevitable. It happened years ago— a semi-random, terrible slaughter orchestrated by Charles Manson and his cult family. What Manson conceived of at the time as deliberate chaos is now just history—a horrible thing that happened because an evil person willed it into being. Sharon Tate’s death did not usher in the apocalypse, and Charles Manson died in prison. It’s a tragic, pointless story, and it’s the one that Sharon Tate will always be remembered for. The Haunting of Sharon Tate imagines a world in which the actress’s death, and therefore her legacy, was narrowly avoided, imbuing the star with the foresight and agency to predict and prevent her own murder.
Director Daniel Farrands’ conceit reportedly traces back to a tabloid’s claim that Tate had a premonition that she would die a full year before the Manson family invasion. The image of an ill-fated starlet plagued by visions of a disturbing future is a vivid one, but one that a basic sense of courtesy and propriety would prohibit most people from converting into a feature-length film. It’s a thought experiment best suited for private contemplation: a young Sharon Tate pregnant with premonition, bewildered and terrified, as a vision of Lizzie McGuire star Hilary Duff playing her in a poorly written 2019 snuff film flashes before her eyes.
Throughout the film, Tate repeatedly wonders if fate can be tampered with, or if we’re all “slaves to our own destiny.” The Haunting of Sharon Tate marks a fate so strange, unpredictable, and cruel that no one ever could have seen it coming—but someone probably could have, and should have, stopped it.
Tate’s sister Debra has deemed the film “classless,” and that lack of support from the murdered subject of the film’s family really says it all. Watching an unauthorized Sharon Tate film makes you feel just about as icky as you’d expect. Rather than attempting to alleviate the inherent grossness of dramatizing a vile murder, The Haunting of Sharon Tate leans right in, all jump scares and unapologetic snuff-film vibes. Not content to just ratchet up the scary soundtrack and run right through the prop blood supply, the film’s premise demands that the audience watch the murders over and over again.
In The Haunting of Sharon Tate , the Valley of the Dolls actress arrives at her Benedict Canyon home 72 hours before her death. She becomes increasingly distracted by nightmares and visions, which are dotted with waking clues. There are strange envelopes from “Charlie,” a guy who’s been coming around the house looking for an old tenant. Tate learns about Charlie’s followers, his “family,” and her rapidly increasing paranoia is triggered by a dead dog and two waifish, wide-eyed girls who come too close to her on the walking trail. Naturally, her live-in friends Abigail Folger (Lydia Hearst), and Wojciech Frykowski (Pawel Szajda) think she’s going insane (although Abigail does concede that they’ve been having some weird people over, and smoking some pretty dank weed). Tate’s husband, Roman Polanski , is off working on a film, but Sharon is convinced that he’s having an affair. She creeps around the property in set loops, from the nursery to the window, from the bedroom to the door. Sometimes it’s a nightmare, running through the particulars of her death over and over again. Then suddenly she’s awake, a hand on her stomach, with a distantly-vexed expression suggesting physical discomfort but also, I would like to think, the pain of reciting such horrible dialogue.
When she isn’t randomly waxing on about fate and chance, Tate is awkwardly teasing her ex Jay Sebring (Jonathan Bennett) with totally normal comments like, “Well you didn’t become stylist to the stars by just running your fingers through their hair,” or she’s hilariously whispering “Damn you, Roman!” to an empty bed. As the spooky situation continues to devolve, Tate repeats a number of warnings and unconvincing, stock-scared responses like, “Something is very wrong inside this house”—understandable, coming from a woman who’s been dying for three days, but not very conducive to the pure-terror vibe the film is clearly going for.
This wooden acting, and the relationships that come off as fake and far-fetched as the plot they’re cycling through, are all consequences of a film that prioritizes cheap scares over convincing characters. At the end of the film, when Tate’s premonitions finally come true, she’s run through them so many times that she knows how to stop it. She fights back, stabbing and cursing out her assailants, and lives to haunt her own fate.
In one of the final scenes, a bloodied Tate returns to her house the morning after, seemingly on another plane of reality—she sees the cops, the corpses, the newspaper headlines. She walks away from all of it. But this show of agency, after a night of very spirited self-defense, is undermined by the Tate who we see onscreen. Duff plays the young actress as a tragic Hollywood starlet—not a pregnant, terrified, and totally exasperated human being. She’s vacant and beautiful, with permanently pursed lips and a knockoff Christian Louboutin accent (fancy, expensive, but just off). Occasionally sounding inexplicably British is about the only interesting thing that Duff’s Sharon Tate does. Scary dreams do not a multi-dimensional character make. Starring in a movie that epitomizes our grotesque cultural obsession with dead girls, Tate comes across as a pretty projection. The film about defying fate finds Tate relegated to her perpetual post-mortem role of tragic enigma. Sharon Tate might as well be a ghost in her own life story, for how little we see of her here."

Matt Wilstein 04.07.19 12:02 AM ET
Saturday Night Live gave Donald Trump a break this week and instead put Joe Biden through the ringer.
Jason Sudeikis busted back onto the show in a cold open sketch that found the former vice president undergoing sensitivity training following a week in which he was repeatedly accused of inappropriate behavior with women over the years and awkwardly tried to dismiss those allegations with a series of jokes.
“You guys know that I’m a tactile politician, right?” Sudeikis’ Biden asked his campaign staffers. “I’m a hugger, I’m a kisser, and I’m a little bit of a sniffer. The last thing I ever want to do is offend anyone.”
With that in mind, they brought in a consultant played by Kate McKinnon to school him on how to behave, and Biden immediately started nuzzling her head and rubbing her arms. “Yeah, so this is exactly the kind of thing I’m here to prevent.”
“Wait, I think nose to nose is going to be OK,” Biden replied. “Because look, I did the 23andme thing, like Lizzie, what’s her name, Warren, right? It turns out that I’m 1-percent Eskimo, so I’m allowed to do the kissing.” When she told him he shouldn’t be hugging or kissing any women he meets, he protested. “That’s a human connection. That’s my whole thing,” he said. “That’s like telling Mario Batali to take his Crocs off.”
Later, they presented some female voters so Biden could practice and when he was told one was looking for someone who could beat Donald Trump, he asked, “You mean the guy who actually bragged about assault on tape?”
“Yes, but unlike his voters, your voters actually care,” his staffer replied.
Ultimately, Biden admitted he didn’t really learn anything from the experience. “But the important thing, I think, is that I’m listening, I hear you, I feel you,” Biden said. “So let’s hug it out, America, what do you say? Biden and some woman in 2020, right? We can do this!” READ THIS LIST"
The Secret Service Agent Who Jailed the KKK and Paved the Way to Guantanamo,www.thedailybeast.com,Lewis Beale,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-secret-service-agent-who-jailed-the-kkk-and-paved-the-way-to-guantanamo,"INNOVATOR The Secret Service Agent Who Jailed the KKK and Paved the Way to Guantanamo History has all but forgotten Hiram C. Whitley, who ran the Secret Service for U.S. Grant, but he infiltrated the Klan and inaugurated the nation’s first anti-terror efforts. 04.06.19 10:24 PM ET Amazon
On the night of September 2, 1871, several members of the Ku Klux Klan locked up Henry Lowther, a black farmer from Georgia whom they accused of plotting an armed uprising of black men and sleeping with white women. Two nights later, 180 Klansmen took Lowther from his cell, tied him up, and led him to a swamp, where they threatened to lynch or castrate him.
They chose the latter.
Atrocities like these were not uncommon in the South after the Civil War, which was why the United States Secret Service set up a clandestine unit to infiltrate and destroy the Klan. In Freedom’s Detective: The Secret Service, The Ku Klux Klan and the Man Who Masterminded America’s First War On Terror , author Charles Lane tells how Hiram C. Whitley , then head of the Secret Service, ran this anti-terrorist operation, and how some of his methodology continues to influence today’s war on groups like Isis and Al Qaeda.
“Whitley has been completely lost to history,” said Lane in an interview with The Daily Beast. “He does not get the credit he deserves for innovative tactics fighting this unprecedented evil in the country.”
Whitley was not the most obvious choice to run a program tasked with protecting the black citizens of the South and their white supporters. A former slave-catcher and ethically slippery businessman—Lane says in the book that “throughout his life, Hiram C. Whitley practiced situational honesty”—Whitley initially entered the spy business when he offered his services to the Union Army as a source of intelligence on rebel-held areas north of New Orleans.
After the war, and after a period of time living in Massachusetts, where he was accused of swindling an apothecary out of his shop and selling fake whiskey and diamonds (he somehow managed to avoid criminal liability in these cases), Whitley moved to D.C. looking for government work, and soon got a temporary appointment as a special agent for the Treasury Department. Two years later he was named head of the Secret Service, which had been established only four years earlier, and was primarily used to detect counterfeiting.
Around this time the Klan, which had been established in 1865 by Confederate veterans, began a terror campaign targeting blacks and their white sympathizers. Supported by President Ulysses S. Grant and his allies in Congress, Whitley realized that in order to fight the Klan he had to infiltrate it and convince its members to turn against each other. “He was great at creating covert operations, and he had a knack for deception, disguise, and creating plausible deniability,” Lane told the Beast.
Whitley did more than that—he created the conditions that eventually culminated in the prison at Guantanamo. He and his men arrested suspects and material witnesses, then sent some of them to Fort Pulaski , on the Georgia coast near Savannah, where they were to be interrogated. He then placed previously isolated prisoners in a cell together, listened in on their conversations, and told them that if they did not confess their guilt, they would never be free until they did. And if they did, he could guarantee them a new life under government protection, thus creating the first witness protection program.
“Whitley was way ahead of his time in believing if you’re fighting terrorists you have to get them to confess, and the best way to do that is to isolate them,” said Lane. “The instinct he had to understand basic human emotions is very impressive. He didn’t waste a lot of time on lofty concepts.”
In fact, Whitley was not averse to early forms of psychological torture. In the case of two black men who were reluctant prosecution witnesses, Whitley threatened to shoot one of them with a cannon, and the other man he forced into a “sweatbox” for more than 24 hours. As Whitley himself put it, “in localities where the masses are defective, where the local police are governed by the popular prejudice and where every stranger is looked upon with suspicion, all routine methods of detection become useless and must be superseded by entirely new and original modes of procedure.”
There is little doubt that Whitley’s “original modes of procedure” had their effect. By late 1871, Klan violence in Alabama and the Carolinas, the main areas of the Secret Service’s operations, had practically ceased, and thousands of Klansmen had been arrested and indicted.
But in 1872, an election year during which Grant needed Southern votes to secure his re-election, the president and his administration felt that Whitley’s crackdown was simply an emergency measure that had stopped the violence, and could be scaled back. Whitley vehemently disagreed. “Fort Pulaski definitely led to Guantanamo and the concept that you don’t necessarily have to follow the letter of the law when interrogating terrorists.”
After Grant was re-elected (and carried eight of 11 former Confederate states), “a major feature of Grant’s second term was ‘we forced these guys to back off, now we can approach them with amnesty and pardons,’” said Lane. “Whitley was one of the very few who never believed you would win these people over with concessions. Because he was tapped into his agent’s reports, he knew better than [Grant and his advisers] did what they were dealing with. He felt we have to smash these people, crush them.”
That never happened. Eventually, many Klansmen were pardoned or served their sentences and resumed their violence, as Whitley had predicted. But by this point, tainted irrevocably by a bungled 1874 safe cracking intended to smear a political opponent, Whitley had resigned as chief of the Secret Service. He eventually moved to Emporia, Kansas, where he became a successful hotel owner and died, a forgotten man, in 1919.
Whitley lived in a different time, and many of his methods would be anathema today. “All the stuff that involves gathering evidence without legal procedures would be impossible,” said Lane. “To the extent Whitley’s agents gathered any physical evidence without warrants, that would be thrown out, and the Miranda warning would influence things.”
But Fort Pulaski definitely led to Guantanamo and the concept that you don’t necessarily have to follow the letter of the law when interrogating terrorists (waterboarding, anyone?). Still, said Lane, “even if you’re against the Klan, you could have misgivings about using covert methods to destroy them. But you can’t have a serious national state without having this capability.”
And there’s this: “If you are faced with a terrorist threat,” added Lane, “whether domestic or foreign, you must have a clandestine ability to fight it, and it must be organized lawfully. And fighting the Klan was the first time the United States had to deal with that.” READ THIS LIST"

In February 1945 it was destroyed by the Allied air campaign. 04.06.19 10:22 PM ET The Yorck Project
Around 10:30 p.m. on the night of Feb. 13, 1945, air raid sirens began to blare. This was not unusual; the sirens went off most nights. But as a civilian town that had largely managed to escape involvement in war production activities, Dresden had previously been spared from Allied attacks and had instead become a haven for German refugees.
On this night, the sirens were followed not just by a deadly rain of bombs, but a blanket attack of explosives that produced a vicious inferno.
Over the two days of the attack, Dresden went up in flames consuming everything in its path including a still unknown number of civilian lives that some estimates put in the hundreds of thousands.
“The bombs had thrown people into the trees,” Matthias Griebel, who was 8 at the time of the bombing, told The New York Times in 1995. “The streets had broken up. The water mains had broken. The gas pipes were on fire. It was how you would imagine hell.”
While nothing could dispel the tragedy of the lives lost, there was one bright spot amid the destruction. Dresden was a cultural mecca known for its impressive art collection. By the end of WWII , most of the treasures from the city’s Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister, or Old Masters Gallery, had been safely secured in the countryside.
Among the estimated 450 works of art that were lost or destroyed by the firebombings and attendant looting by the Red Army in the aftermath of the war’s end, there is one canvas lost that is widely considered the most important: Gustave Courbet’s “The Stonebreakers.”
It was a revolutionary work, one of the French Realist’s greatest paintings, and in February of 1945, it was destroyed by the Allied air campaign.
Ninety-five years before fire rained down on Dresden, Courbet debuted his new painting “The Stonebreakers” at the Paris Salon of 1850-51 and reportedly caused “a sensation.”
It was a massive painting—5.5 feet-by-8.5 feet—on a scale normally reserved for historically important landscapes or portraits. But Courbet used his sizable canvas to portray two shabby peasants engaged in backbreaking labor. It was shocking.
Courbet began catching the attention of the French art establishment only two years prior to this scandalous exhibition. The young painter grew up in the countryside of Ornans, a place he had a deep connection to and one he painted often.
While he was born into a prosperous, land-owning family, he embraced populist politics, fashioned himself as a bohemian figure in the counterculture of the day, and reveled in shocking the establishment. (When offered the Legion of Honor in 1870, he gave the French cultural authorities a vocal and very public middle finger.)
In January, 1848, he wrote to his family, “I am about to make it any time now, for I am surrounded by people who are very influential in the newspapers and the arts, and who are very excited about my painting. Indeed, we are about to form a new school, of which I will be the representative in the field of painting.”
Later that year, he did indeed begin to enjoy some acclaim, but it was two years after that when Courbet catapulted himself into the artistic conversation when he showed a trio of controversial paintings at the annual Paris Salon. These three works, one of which was “The Stonebreakers,” are credited with establishing a new school of art—Realism.
While most prominent artists of the day were focused on painting monumental historical works or grand portraits of the well-to-do, Courbet began to paint ordinary people based on real-life scenes depicted exactly as he saw them. “It is not often that one encounters so complete an expression of poverty and so, right then and there I got the idea for a painting”
“The Stonebreakers” was based on two men, one young and one old, whom he discovered engaged in grueling work on the side of the road when he returned to Ornans for an eight-month visit in October 1948.
“It is not often that one encounters so complete an expression of poverty and so, right then and there I got the idea for a painting,” he told his friends and art critics Francis Wey and Jules Champfleury.
He described the resulting painting as “composed of two very pitiable figures… One is an old man, an old machine grown stiff with service and age… The one behind him is a young man about fifteen years old, suffering from scurvy.”
The critics, for their part, were not quite as delighted with the novel subject. They tossed around such incendiary accusations as “Socialist” and “democratic.”
“What appears to have most disturbed conservative critics about Courbet's art, and what prompted these and other charges, was its ‘deliberate ugliness,’ which meant its embrace of both a popular (‘ugly’) content and a popular (working-class) Salon audience,” Stephen Eisenman wrote in Nineteenth Century Art .
These barbs were fine with Courbet, who embraced the role of revolutionary. As New York Times art critic Roberta Smith once described him , “Courbet the man was deeply out of sorts, independent, ambitious, wily, perennially dissatisfied with his lot, in addition to being, as he himself put it, ‘the most arrogant man in France.’” He also “[lived] by the phrase “épater le bourgeois,’ or ‘shock the bourgeoisie.’”
Only five years after Courbet riled up the Parisian art establishment, big changes were also happening on the far side of neighboring Germany. On September 25, 1855, the vaunted Old Masters Gallery in Dresden moved into a shiny custom-made museum space in the Zwinger Palace.
The Semper Gallery had been built by one of the top architects of the day—Gottfried Semper—specifically for the impressive art collection that the city’s rulers had assembled over two centuries. It was just one more step that artistic Dresden took in solidifying its turn-of-the-century reputation as the “Paris on the Elbe.”
In its new, impressive space, the Old Masters Gallery continued to grow in size and prestige and in the early 20th century, its fortunes collided with that of the now-deceased Courbet when it acquired the painter’s 1850 masterpiece by way of a gift from the estate of German businessman Max Heinrich Eduard Pröll-Heuer. “The two nameless French men immortalized in oils went up in flames along with so many lives and other historical and architectural treasures”
But “The Stonebreakers’” reign on the walls of the Semper Gallery was relatively short lived. When war broke out in 1939, the museum closed its doors and went to work securing the collection. Paintings and other precious artifacts were evacuated to the countryside where they were dispersed among castles and mine-shafts for safekeeping. Why “The Stonebreakers” was not among them is unknown, but Courbet’s masterpiece stayed in Dresden with a handful of other works.
When the Allies descended on Dresden that dark February night, “The Stonebreakers” was in the path of destruction. The two nameless French men immortalized in oils went up in flames along with so many lives and other historical and architectural treasures.
In the aftermath of the end of WWII, Dresden authorities began to pick up the pieces of all that had been lost. While much of the city was cleared for new construction, the decision was made to rebuild and preserve the buildings around the Zwinger Palace including the Semper Gallery.
The Soviet army absconded with much of the city’s art collection when they came across the treasures stored in the countryside after invading the eastern part of Germany. But in the mid-1950s, an agreement was brokered and most of the works were returned home to the Old Masters Gallery where they remain today.
But an irreplaceable loss remains where “The Stonebreakers” once hung.
“When I stop being controversial, I'll stop being important,” Courbet wrote in an 1852 letter home . He never did, as his surviving work testifies, nor will the events of February 1945 that destroyed one of the greatest among them. READ THIS LIST"

Trans people suffer violence and discrimination (recently most odiously exemplified by President Trump's planned ban on trans troops ). They also live rich, full lives. Photographer Soraya Zaman wanted to show the humanity and beauty of the transmasculine community; to show people as they are in their own skin.
Transmasculity does not necessarily mean that her subjects identify as trans men. Zaman explained, ""Because transgender is an umbrella term, it can be imprecise and does not always describe specific identities and experiences. Transmasculine is a general, broader term for individuals who were (AFAB) Assigned Female at Birth but identify closer to the masculine (or male) side of the gender spectrum.""
Zaman further explained, “The binary days and the antiquated stereotypes of what it means to be born a girl or boy, are finally coming undone. It is time we acknowledge the human race is more unique and special than these strict and simplistic ways of being which are not relevant to anyone.”
Zaman's work challenges the stereotypical ways in which society limits gender fluidity. Using social media as a tool to find her subjects, Zaman interviewed and photographed over 29 individuals ranging in age from 18-35.

‘Killing Eve’ Season 2 Is So F*cking Good,www.thedailybeast.com,kevin.fallon@thedailybeast.com (Kevin Fallon),04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/killing-eve-season-2-review-sandra-oh-and-jodie-comer-are-better-than-ever,"DOUBLE OH SEVEN ‘Killing Eve’ Season 2 Is So F*cking Good Few drama series are this confident and this good right out of the gate in their second seasons. Sophomore slump? Sandra Oh would never. 04.06.19 10:18 PM ET Nick Wall/BBCAmerica
In the nine months since Killing Eve last aired, there’s been a question stalking the series that’s been almost as anxiety-inducing as the chase in the drama itself: Do we really need a season two?
As the number of offerings catapult right up the #PeakTV summit and then up and over the edge, even the biggest fans of certain shows have started to question whether there’s really value in continuing past a first season of television that, as it presented itself in its original form, was practically perfect. Perfect is a strong word, but Killing Eve is a series that merits those .
Phoebe Waller-Bridge ’s BBC America crime series, in which Sandra Oh plays an assassin-obsessed MI6 agent and Jodie Comer the psychopath killer who catches her eye, was unlike anything we had ever seen.
It was a thriller as intense, twisty, and exhilarating as they come, but injected with a style, whimsy, and decidedly feminine deviousness that made each scene its own surprise. What tone would it be? Which shade of Comer’s Villanelle were we going to get? And, the most exciting question, who is chasing whom?

It’s rare for something to feel that special given the imposing mountain of shows there are out there, so it’s understandable to want to milk something that unique for all it’s worth. But there’s also the instinct that maybe we should let nice things be.
This isn’t the first time TV fans have struggled with this existential question. And it’s worth noting that nearly all recent examples have featured women front and center in new takes on genres that used to be dismissed because of their presumed feminine audience. For some, the decision to continue has worked. ( The Handmaid’s Tale , for example.) For others, it very much did not. ( UnREAL .) The jury’s still out on Big Little Lies , and we’re still waiting to hear if they’ll pull the trigger on more Sharp Objects .
But for now, at least, we have the new Killing Eve . And the new Killing Eve is good.
Everything that worked so well in season one is back in essentially the same form, and it’s working again. If that sounds like the show might be retreading the same quirks and feel a bit repetitive, well, that’s true. But it’s such a blast, and so meticulously, weirdly crafted, that you frankly don’t care.
Things pick up, wisely, 30 seconds after we last left.
Eve and Villanelle’s bizarre attraction to each other unexpectedly combusts when they finally spend time together in Villanelle’s apartment. Eve stabs her. Villanelle shoots at Eve. While Eve cowers in the kitchen, Villanelle runs away.
Restarting the action immediately after the events of the finale is a clever way to maintain the first season’s most refreshing creative rule. Killing Eve never bothered with the exhausting exposition that pads and drags most American crime dramas, ensuring the brisk thrill ride blasts off from the first moments. In season two, there’s no need for ham-fisted explanations for why these two are back on each other’s trails again. It’s only been 30 seconds. They never left.
Eve finds her way back to London and basically returns to her previous role of obsessing over Villanelle’s whereabouts, spending all hours of the night Googling for news of where she might have gone. No one could have predicted how appealing a Sandra Oh version of James Bond would be. Double Oh Seven?
It’s Villanelle whose narrative is upended. She’s used to be the being the one who preys. Now she’s injured and on the lam, a fish-out-of-water scenario in which it’s a riot to see her try to keep her bearings—though you suspect, with this cold-blooded killer, she’s always in more control than she lets on. “‘Killing Eve’ never bothered with the exhausting exposition that pads and drags most American crime dramas, ensuring the brisk thrill ride blasts off from the first moments.”
She ends up sharing a hospital room with a teen boy named Gabriel, and she seems to let her guard down, exhibiting some compassion and empathy. You let your guard down, too, which is a mistake.
You spend these scenes—and so many more across the two episodes we were given to review—wondering how human she is. And when it’s made clear again that she isn’t, it’s still jarring every time. The extent to which she, through Comer’s performance, manages to replicate human emotion, though, is spell-binding. It’s what lends the series its menace.
The wicked humor is back. The macabre peculiarities are back. The riveting obsession between these two characters is back again, too.
“Women don’t stab,” Gabriel tells Villanelle when she tells him what Eve did to her. “I know. It surprised me, too. She did it to let me know how much she cared about me,” she says back.
Obsession takes on a different context when it’s women who have the preoccupation, and Killing Eve plays with those suppositions with such canny wit and perverse awareness. The show has the effect of at once mocking the audience for those coded suppositions while engaging in the slickest, smartest spy drama of the modern TV era.
In a show of confidence for season two and its potential to hold on to the all the attention and accolades the first season earned, Killing Eve will be broadcast on both BBC America and AMC this year. The latter, of course, is the network of Mad Men , Breaking Bad , Better Call Saul , and The Walking Dead .
The promotion is business-related—no modern cable series saw its ratings climb the way that Killing Eve ’s did last year—but it’s also symbolic, signaling the show as the next in that crop of elite offerings. It would be the only female-fronted series in the mix, which certainly means something. And it’s about time, too.

What Does Queen Think About Brexit?

It’s Trashing the New Britain She Loves. In the month of Meghan’s baby, everything that the new young royals represent and that the Queen has embraced is being sacrificed to a lunatic idea of the great island race. 04.06.19 10:16 PM ET Photo Illustration by Sarah Rogers/The Daily Beast / Photos Getty
LONDON—The performance of the British Parliament in the Brexit crisis has become so imbecilic that some people are desperately hoping that the Queen might intervene.
Not a chance. The last time a monarch stopped a piece of legislation was in 1707 when Queen Anne struck down an act that would have given Scotland its own militia. As fans of the movie The Favourite will know, Queen Anne could be a handful.
Queen Elizabeth is no Queen Anne and she has spent a lifetime avoiding offering any hint of her political views with consummate skill. During that time the British Empire was dismantled and, along with it went the pretense of any longer being a world power.
All this she seemed to accept as the natural forces of history at work. Her monarchy might easily have gone the way of other European royal houses, either by being reduced to using their titles as grifters among high society or becoming bicycle-riding social democrats.
But the Windsors hung on, politically neutered but tolerated as part of the national scenery in which palaces and castles were still expected to be inhabited.
The Queen had bad moments when it seemed she had lost touch with the mood of her people. The worst example was her tardiness in realizing and acknowledging the depth of public grief over the death of Princess Diana.
But in the last decades of her reign–the longest ever of a British monarch– Elizabeth has not only appeared to embrace the new spirit of her people but to enjoy it in a way that suggests that she must really loathe Brexit and its self-destructive xenophobia.
The evidence for this is in one event that cannot now be overlooked: the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
As with many other Olympics this one might have brought another over-reaching exercise in national propaganda.
But instead of a humorless rear-gazing pageant of lost glories we got a howlingly bonkers street party masterminded by the movie director Danny Boyle that left the rest of the world thinking what a fun country we had become.
There was no menace to others in the script. No sense that festering somewhere offstage in the shires beyond London’s vivid entrepot was a nasty insurgency of aggrieved nativists waiting for the right moment to strike.
Boyle’s script was a masterful balance of messages: secure enough to be self-mocking; shrewd enough to parade world famous cultural icons like Harry Potter, James Bond and David Beckham; nutty enough to be a mix of rock opera and a history of the industrial revolution; clever enough to include the inevitable patriotic trope involving Churchill as a suddenly animate statue; and political enough to make a pointed tableau supporting the National Health Service and universal free health care when the Tories were trying to roll it back. (Boyle faced down a Tory effort to cut it from the program.) “The monarch was at one with a message about her country as a youthful, liberally progressive multi-racial society no longer bound by the old jingoism of what was once aggressively asserted as a distinct ‘island race.’”
And the Queen topped it all by participating in a stunt in which all her assumed dignity, remoteness and solemnity were thrown to the winds.
Boyle directed a sequence in which a taxi draws up at Buckingham Palace and deposits someone so famous that schoolchildren on a tour of the palace impudently break away from the guide to gawk at him—Daniel Craig, a.k.a. James Bond.
At this point it is necessary to caution that any nation that builds a reputation for superlative national intelligence on the record of a misogynistic sociopath like Bond is delusional but no matter: The whole world enjoys the joke, hopefully.
Bond is shown into the Queen’s presence and—a move that apparently the Queen herself suggested—she at first ignores him, finally turning from writing notes at her desk, and utters the magic name, “Mr. Bond.”
What followed was, literally, breathtaking: the Queen follows Bond to a waiting chopper, they zoom low over a series of landmarks and arrive over the Olympic Stadium as the opening ceremony begins, caught in searchlights. Bond and the Queen (daring body doubles) parachute into the arena and then, cutting to the actual event, the Queen makes her entrance to officially declare the games open.
For the massive global television audience watching it was a stunning coup de théâtre . And it was a clear hint of the message to follow. The monarch was at one with a message about her country as a youthful, liberally progressive multi-racial society no longer bound by the old jingoism of what was once aggressively asserted as a distinct “island race.”
And it is that Queen and that message that has been made to look defeated by the Brexit rabble. Why wouldn’t Her Majesty be really pissed?
At this very moment the Queen is about to become the great-grandmother of a child born to a mixed-race divorcee and a grandson whom she has embraced with unstinted enthusiasm.
Meghan Markle and Prince Harry were married in St. George’s Chapel, Windsor Castle in a ceremony that rang with the spirit of a rainbow coalition—a gospel choir from Chicago rocking the place with “Stand by Me,” Meghan and Harry’s generation sitting in the pews alongside doddery old dukes and Oprah! A television audience of 1.9 billion!
And yet beneath the consecration of such enlightened and modern family values there lurked a paradox. This was Windsor Castle and the chapel was hung with heraldic banners noting the many honors bestowed on those who went forth to conquer the world as white Christian crusaders from the island race.
So the royal pageant could be seen in two starkly different and subjective ways in which each response ignored the other. Through one set of eyes the monarchy was passing from one generation to another with the Queen assenting happily to the ecumenical new Windsors. Through another set of equally fervent eyes this was Britannia in Excelsis, the thundering medieval setting overcoming a charade of change and summoning all the atavistic emotions of Brexit.
Like the rest of the country this leaves the Queen dangerously poised between relevance and irrelevance.
Should Brexit prevail the new young royals could find themselves imprisoned for life as the indentured cast of the world’s most loved soap opera. Will and Kate, Harry and Meghan and their children will be one of the few surefire sources of revenue for a beleaguered island economy as they attract waves of tourists.
In dramatic terms this has all the glamor and tensions of the Netflix blockbuster The Crown . The Queen finally succeeded by the petulant and broody Charles in thrall to his matriarchal ex-paramour, now an overweening duchess; questions about whether the institution can survive until King Will ascends; endless tabloid fictions about family feuds while as this narrative constantly reinvents itself Scotland declares independence and rejoins the European Union, Northern Ireland is absorbed into a united Ireland that, helped by the largesse of E.U. funding, becomes the economic miracle of Europe.
Alas poor England, left as the exhausted rump of the kingdom , now no more than a giant theme park composed of tourist sites drawing on a combination of The Crown and Downton Abbey , with some of the royal castles sold off to become part of the enduring Harry Potter franchise.
The Queen must by now surely realize along with millions of her subjects that Brexit is not a natural force of history at work. It is a rejection of the future and a rush backward to isolation and impotence. As such it must be intolerable to the woman who has learned from her own history that fall need not necessarily follow decline. READ THIS LIST"
The Stonewall Riots Weren’t New York City’s Only Queer Uprising,www.thedailybeast.com,Hugh Ryan,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/stonewall-wasnt-new-york-citys-only-queer-uprising-remembering-the-haven-riot,"The Stonewall Riots Weren’t New York City’s Only Queer Uprising Photofusion/Shutterstock The Stonewall Riots were not in isolation. As their 50th anniversary approaches, we should remember New York City's other cops vs. queers clashes of the era, like the Haven riot. Hugh Ryan 04.06.19 10:13 PM ET
O n a hot summer night nearly 50 years ago, a gang of New York City police decided to make an example of a gay club in Greenwich Village. An election was approaching, and the police had been cracking down on queer people all around the city in the lead-up to it.
After hauling the patrons out into the street, the police trashed the bar. According to a report in Gay Flames (“A Bulletin of the Homofire Movement”), they destroyed “7 telephones, two 15-foot bars, a dozen couches, electric consoles, wiring, strobe lights, speakers and amplifiers… [and] about 3,000 smashed phonograph records”—a total of some $20,000 in damages.
This was fairly routine— cops have been busting bars that serve queer men in New York City since at least the early 1900s —but that night, something was different.
The patrons fought back, and soon, people all over the Village joined in. Clashes went on for hours (some say days), and before the evening was over, a jewelry shop and a record store had been smashed and looted, two cars had been overturned, a score of public trash cans were set on fire, multiple people were clubbed by the cops, and at least 10 were arrested.
No, I’m not talking about what happened at the Stonewall Inn that infamous day in June, 1969. This was a 1970 raid on The Haven, an alcohol-free gay after-hours club located at 1 Sheridan Square. Although the Stonewall Riot is often thought of as a singular event, unlike anything else in queer American history , it was but the first of a series of clashes between cops and queers in the late 1960s and early 1970s—at least, the first in New York.
In San Francisco, the police had experienced similar queer resistance when they tried to hassle trans women hanging out at the Compton Cafeteria in 1966 , sparking nights of queer resistance.
Since the end of World War II, police harassment of the queer community in America had been steadily escalating, and as American politics turned radical in the late 1960s, the queer community began to resist in more visible, vocal, and confrontational ways.
This was a period of incredible militancy and direct action by marginalized communities around the country, including queer people, black power activists, women’s liberationists, and others.
In Los Angeles in 1959, LGBT customers fought back against police harassment at a popular branch of Cooper Do-Nuts. In 1961, a group of homophobic servicemen decided to—foolishly— target the patrons of the Black Nite bar in Milwaukee, who fought back. In 1967, there were demonstrations after a violent police raid of the LGBT Black Cat Tavern in Silver Lake, Los Angeles.
Looking at other anti-police queer-led protests shows us that Stonewall was not a unique historical outlier, but the inevitable product of the clash between post-World-War-II homo/transphobia, and the growing strength of the newly empowered queer community.
While direct actions like Stonewall obviously helped change the course of queer life in America , they did so in conjunction with other, more conciliatory forms of queer resistance.
In 1965, activists from the Mattachine Society opposed the New York State Liquor Authority’s policy of shuttering any bar that served out homosexuals; shortly thereafter, the New York State Commission on Human Rights would publicly agree with their stance, cutting the legal legs out from under the police who raided queer establishments.
By 1967, gay activists had convinced Mayor John Lindsay to also oppose the routine police entrapment of queer men in New York City. The erosion of these institutional homophobic policies set the stage for the expansion of out queer community in the mid-1970s, but it took the masses of queer people fighting back in the streets to give real teeth to this decriminalization of homosexual life.
Between 1969 and 1972, Greenwich Village was rocked by a series of queer counter rebellions, protest marches, and building take-overs—many of them inspired by, on behalf of, or in conjunction with, other marginalized communities.
By looking what happened at The Haven in August of 1970 it’s possible to see just how much these various liberation movements overlapped and influenced one another.
According to Steven Dansky’s collected oral history Hot August Night/1970 , before the police ever arrived at the club that evening, queer people and feminists of all kinds had already gathered in Times Square, to participate in a rally against police violence.
Planning for the action began when two Latinx attendees came to a Gay Liberation Front (GLF) meeting in July to let the largely white, downtown crowd know about the escalating violence against queer and gender non-conforming people in Times Square (primarily, but not exclusively, people of color).
A whole host of organizations would participate in the rally itself, including GLF, the Gay Activists Alliance, the 'Radicalesbians,' and a coalition of women’s liberation groups.
From the beginning, the marchers were prepared for police harassment; along with chants of “gay, gay power to the gay, gay people,” they called out “male chauvinists you better start shakin’—today’s pig is tomorrow’s bacon,” according to an article written by participant Martha Shelley .
After marching around Times Square several times, the protesters spontaneously decided to march down to Christopher Street—“the symbolic birthplace of our movement,” as Kenneth Pitchford described it in an article he later wrote for Double F , “a magazine of Effeminism.” “ If we thought our rage had peaked before, now we felt something new; the hard tightening of something final in our guts ”
Along the way, the marchers were attacked by straight onlookers, who threw bottles and trash from the safety of apartments high above their heads. Not only did the police fail to intervene, according to Shelley, they also refused to bring two wounded marchers to the hospital, leaving community members to bring them by taxi instead.
Thus, the crowd was already on edge by the time they crossed 14th Street; as Pitchford recalled, “If we thought our rage had peaked before, now we felt something new; the hard tightening of something final in our guts.”
When they reached the Women’s House of Detention—the 11-story women’s prison that was once located at the intersection of 6th and Greenwich Aves— they found themselves joined by a large number of “street people,” in Pitchford’s words.
The area around the House of Detention had a reputation as a meeting point for the families and friends of those on the inside (particularly queer women), dating back at least to the 1930s.
Jay Toole , a community organizer who was imprisoned at the House of D multiple times over the course of the 1960s, remembered the prison was occasionally referred to as “the playground” by butches. The corner of 8th Street and 6th Avenue, Toole told me, was “where we met our girls” as they went to or left the House of D.
Most likely, these were the “street people” that joined the protest outside the prison that night. Estimates put the size of the crowd at anywhere from 250 to 2,000 people.
Joan Nestle, the founder of the Lesbian Herstory Archives , called the House of Detention “a warning, a beacon, a reminder and a moment of community,” which was omnipresent in lesbian life in the 1960s.
In the immediate aftermath of the Stonewall Riots, the newly formed Gay Liberation Front helped organize a week of 24/7 protests outside the prison. In March of 1970, a number of women’s liberation groups engaged in a tense, and at times violent, standoff with police outside the prison gates (and later that same night, the police, led by the same officer in charge during the Stonewall raid, attacked The Snake Pit , a gay bar in the Village, perhaps in retribution).
However, according to Stonewall veteran Jim Fouratt, most of the official protests directed at the House of D, even by LGBTQ groups, were over the illegal arrest and detainment of Black Panther Party leaders.
Joan Bird had just been released from the prison a month before The Haven riot, in July of 1970, and Angela Davis would be held there for months starting that October (although Davis wouldn’t publicly come out as a lesbian until the late 1990s, in her autobiographyshe described homosexuality as “one of the centers around which life in the House of Detention revolved.”)
This relationship of support was not one way. Just a few months before The Haven raid, the Black Panther Party’s Minister of Defense, Huey P. Newton, had issued a statement calling for the Panthers to “try to form a working coalition with the Gay Liberation and Women's Liberation Groups” (most likely influenced by his friendship with civil rights and gay power activist Kiyoshi Kuromiya ).
The BPP had obvious, long-standing, and well-discussed issues with homophobia and misogyny (as did pretty much the entirety of the Left, and the country, at the time), but the positive relationships between 1970s liberationists rarely get the same amount of attention.
The Women’s House of Detention in Greenwich Village was one of the sites where the concerns of nearly every liberation movement—black, Latino, feminist, anti-racist, queer, Third World, Marxist, etc.—connected.
After protesting the prison, the march began to disperse – at which point, activists heard about what was happening at The Haven. Many believed the cops knew that most queer activists would be at the rally in Times Square that night, and had raided The Haven assuming there would be little opposition.
But the cops were wrong.
As Martha Shelley wrote, “Masses of people, marchers and cruisers, crowded up in front of the Haven. A sister whispered to me, ‘There’s going to be trouble.’ Sure enough, the cops started swinging their nightsticks, and people began to run… Word came from behind us that the Women in the House of Detention had begun to riot and burn their mattresses. We took the crowd back to the House of D. Sure enough, flaming objects were descending from the windows.”
(While she wasn’t there the night of The Haven raid, Angela Davis described the experience of being on the inside during a similar protest in her autobiography. Women throughout the building chanted along with the protesters and refused to return to their cells. After 48 hours, the guards beat one imprisoned woman so loudly the rest could hear, and threw her in solitary confinement, to get the rest to behave.)
As the women in the House of D began rioting, the night descended into a pitched street battle. According to Pitchford,
The well-organized police violence began. First massing, then moving out on the double, clubbing in all directions, seizing prey at random, dragging people away. One of our badly beaten street-fighters, a young black brother was carried off unconscious. People knelt down and daubed their hands with his blood and streaked it over their faces like war paint… six cops with clubs surrounded a captive faggot (a white brother, this time) in front of a store window grating and slammed him against it again and again, his head battered, his groin prodded with clubs. His screams pulled us toward him – until a heavy line of club-swinging police reinforcements drove us back…
They said afterward that two cars had been overturned, seven cops hurt (one supposedly knifed, according to the Daily News), 18 of our people arrested, and (hopefully) Inspector Michael Lonergan of the Third Division kneed in the groin… Lesbians and faggots found a new pride and anger in themselves, and stepped out from behind all sorts of brain-damaging euphemisms and began to learn how to fight the vicious genocidal system that oppresses us as much as any other un-Amerikan people in the world.
By dawn, it seemed the protests had subsided, although a few people remember isolated incidents between queer people and cops over the next two days. The weekend papers were filled with accounts of the gay violence in Greenwich Village—as well as stories of three police raids on Black Panther Party offices in Philadelphia, which ended in gun fights, clouds of tear gas, fifteen arrests, and three wounded officers. “ Had Stonewall not occurred, we would have immortalized a different moment of queer resistance ”
Unlike Stonewall, however, The Haven raid and the House of Detention protest were quickly forgotten. A general amnesia about queer militancy—and the connections between various liberation and power movements—set in quickly.
Stonewall would be more likely to be referenced in connection with the death of Judy Garland than in connection with the other uprisings that took place in the early 1970s.
Stonewall obviously inspired much of the courageous activism that came afterwards—including that on the night of The Haven raid—but almost certainly, had Stonewall not occurred, we would have immortalized a different moment of queer resistance.
As we take this time to immortalize Stonewall, we should also remember Mattachine and 'Radicalesbians'; The Black Panther Party and the Women’s House of Detention; The Haven Raid, The Snake Pit Raid, and every other forgotten (or not-yet-remembered) moment of queer resistance."
MacKenzie Bezos faces legal and practical limits on any Amazon sales - Business Insider - BPC News,britishpakistanis.online,,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://britishpakistanis.online/mackenzie-bezos-faces-legal-and-practical-limits-on-any-amazon-sales-business-insider/,"admin
MacKenzie Bezos, right, will be one of the biggest individual shareholders in Amazon after her divorce from Jeff Bezos. Jörg Carstensen/picture alliance via Getty Images MacKenzie Bezos likely won’t sell off a significant portion of her newly independent stake in Amazon anytime soon, legal experts said. Following her impending divorce from Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos , MacKenzie will hold 4% of the company’s outstanding shares on her own — a stake worth $35.7 billion. That raises the possibility that MacKenzie Bezos could try to liquidate her assets by selling much or all of her Amazon stake. However, some practical and potential legal considerations will limit her ability to sell off sizeable portions of that stake in big chunks, the experts said. Visit Business Insider’s homepage for more stories .
Don’t expect MacKenzie Bezos to go on a selling spree after her divorce from Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos is finalized.
Nearly all of MacKenzie’s newly independent wealth will be likely be tied up in the Amazon shares she will get as part of the divorce settlement, making her one of the comapny’s largest individual shareholders. A regulatory document Amazon filed concerning the divorce agreement with the Securities and Exchange Commission indicates that the settlement itself places no restrictions on her ability to sell her shares in the open market.
This could, in theory, have some serious ramifications for Amazon investors: While MacKenzie Bezos is granting Jeff Bezos voting control over her block of Amazon stock as part of the divorce agreement, it raises the possibility that she could try to sell off her stake in a move to liquidate her assets — a manuever that would almost certainly have an adverse affect on the stock price.
But practical considerations and potentially some legal limits will likely prevent or discourage her from selling off her stake in huge chunks, securities law experts told Business Insider.
One practical consideration is the sheer size of MacKenzie’s stake. After a Washington court finalizes her divorce from Jeff, which should happen in about three months, she will hold around 19.7 million shares of Amazon’s stock, or around 4% of its outstanding stock — an allotment that’s worth around $35.7 billion.
But MacKenzie could easily undercut the value of her shares and any amount she saw from selling them were she to sell off a sizeable portion. About 5 million shares of Amazon are bought and sold daily. Even if she sold just 5% of her stake, that would involve moving nearly a millions shares, or about 20% of that daily volume. Such an uptick could overwhelm demand for the shares and send Amazon’s share price downward. Public perception will be a problem for MacKenzie
Another thing she’ll have to consider before selling any sizeable stake is the signal that might send to the market. Post-divorce, MacKenzie almost certainly won’t be legally considered an insider at Amazon any more. But any trade on her part, particularly any that happen soon after the divorce, is likely to trigger concerns among investors about the reasoning behind it.
“The public will question whether her sales are motivated by insider information,” said Mercer Bullard, a securities law professor at the University of Mississippi School of Law. He continued: “Perception will be a problem. Her actions may be market moving for the wrong reasons.”
“If she does plan to sell off a significant portion of her shares, MacKenzie would be wise to set up a planned trading program along the lines of those that corporate executives use to immunize themselves from charges of insider trading,” he said. Such plans usually are configured to sell off set numbers of shares on a regular basis regardless of a company’s stock price or its recent financial results.
“The way to keep her actions out of the negative limelight is to be as transparent as possible,” Bullard said. The SEC could consider her to be in league with Jeff
Legal restrictions may also limit her ability to sell off large portions of her stake at once, experts said.
When it comes to public reporting requirements and trading limits, securities regulations generally focus on large shareholders and corporate insiders. At first glance, such rules wouldn’t appear to apply to MacKenzie Bezos. She doesn’t have a position at the company, and her individual stake in Amazon will be below the 5% threshold the SEC sets for when shareholders have to report their stakes in a company and what they’re doing with their shares.
But the calculus may change because she’s getting her shares from Jeff Bezos, who is an insider, and because, as part of the divorce settlement, she agreed to let him vote her shares. Because of that voting agreement — and the fact that Jeff Bezos will hold 12% of Amazon’s shares after the divorce — the SEC may deem her to be part of a shareholder group that controls more than 5% of the company’s stock, securities lawyers said. If so, she may have to publicly file regular updates on the size of her stake. She may also have to disclose each and every trade she makes in Amazon’s stock.
“She won’t have enough stock on her own,” said Paul Fasciano, a partner at Sadis & Goldberg. “But if she’s considered to be part of group then, yes,” she’ll have to report her holdings and trades. She may have legal limits on her trades
Amazon spokeswoman Halle Gordon declined to comment on whether MacKenzie will be subject to any reporting requirements or trading limits.
And yet another set of regulations may come into play when it concerns MacKenzie’s holdings — the SEC’s Rule 144, which governs certain kinds of stock transactions involving insiders. Because she will be getting the shares in a private transaction from an insider at the company, the SEC may consider her shares to be restricted, securities lawyers said. Such a designation could require her to hold the shares for six months or even a year before selling any of them.
Additionally, because of the voting agreement she struck with Jeff Bezos, the SEC may consider her to be essentially an affiliate of the company. Such a designation would limit her to selling in any three-month period to either a 1% stake in the company or 1% of the average weekly trading volume, whichever is greater.
“She may have 144 restrictions,” Fasciano said.

Where Could They Be? Discovering a ruined ancient city does rather seem like the archaeological equivalent of winning an Olympic gold. 04.06.19 10:11 PM ET John Elk III / Alamy
After 14 years of digging, archaeologists excavating in the Holy Land announced that they have found the biblical city of Ai, a Caananite stronghold that was captured by the Israelites (according to the book of Judges). It’s not the only recently discovered city of cultural significance: only two years ago Douglas Preston published a book documenting his team’s discovery of the so-called Lost City of the Monkey God in the Honduran jungle. News like this makes you wonder what other important lost cities are out there to be discovered.
1. El Dorado
In the early 16th century, German conquistadors Nikolaus Federmann and Georg von Speyer set off in search of El Dorado, a mythical golden city, in Venezuela. They didn’t find it, and instead became the first of many 16th century European treasure hunters who hoped and failed to locate the famed valley of gold. In pursuit of gold (and cinnamon), one of these, Francisco de Orellana, “discovered” the Amazon river (which they named after a group of female warriors who attacked their group along the way). The efforts of predominantly Spanish conquistadors to discover (and pillage) the city of gold were related to colonialist exploitation of the region in general and particularly their observation of the use of gold in pre-Colombian religious rituals and ceremonies. The Musica people used to adorn new kings with gold before depositing a trove of golden objects in the middle of a lake as part of religious ceremonies. The discovery of a cache of gold at Lake Guatavita in 1545 only added fuel to the rumors that more was out there to be found. When Alexander von Humboldt visited the area in 1801 he estimated that as much as $300 million worth of gold was there. El Dorado, on the other hand, appears to be a mythical outgrowth of religious rituals.
Archaeologist Dr. Larry Coben, the executive director of the Sustainable Preservation Initiative and a seasoned excavator of Incan sites, told The Daily Beast that he would love to take an academically responsible approach to finding the lost cities. Just like his predecessors, Coben would be in the Amazonian jungle conducting exploratory work (in a less sensationalist and more scientific way); unlike them, Coben doesn’t expect to find any gold. “I doubt they are ‘cities of gold,’” he told me, but the mythology is likely to be based on real cities, the discovery of which could yield important information about the sites. “The extraordinary ability of ancient cultures to bring complex urbanity to difficult and not obvious places speaks volumes about their development, technological competence, and social and economic structures.” Unearthing them would help flesh out our understanding of the pre-Colombian world. Those who really want to see the remnants of the “cities of gold” should go to the Museo del Oro in Bogota, which houses the largest collection of gold artifacts in the world.
2. Dilmun
Dilmun was an ancient Semitic speaking city in the Persian Gulf that was first mentioned in the 3rd millennium B.C. It came to the attention of Assyriologists and explorers in the 19th century, when cuneiform texts were recovered and translated. The most famous of these was the Epic of Gilgamesh, which includes the ancient Mesopotamian flood story that likely inspired the biblical story. Dr. Alexis Boutin, associate professor of anthropology at Sonoma State University, told me that these texts describe Dilmun “as a place with paradise-like qualities, especially noted for its sweet (i.e., fresh) waters.” Because of this, “some people even thought it may have been the location of the original Garden of Eden.” What we do know from the extant Mesopotamian texts is that Dilmun was a major trading partner with Mesopotamia, in particular Meluhha (the Indus civilization) and Magan (Oman). For a while, though, scholars weren’t even sure that this potential Garden of Eden was a civilization at all. Boutin told me that because of the thousands of burial mounds carpeting Bahrain, some 19th century scholars thought that it had served as a necropolis for ancient Mesopotamians. “This theory, however, was later disproven by excavations that revealed that Bronze Age urban and commercial centers on Bahrain were an important part of the Dilmun polity.”
The physical location of Dilmun, however, was disputed for many decades, although it always assumed to be somewhere in the vicinity of the Arabian Gulf. Dr. Boutin told me that “based on archaeological work done in the 1940s and 1950s by folks including Peter Cornwall, Geoffrey Bibby, and P.V. Glob (and since carried on by archaeologists primarily from Denmark, France, and Bahrain), the location of Dilmun is now known to have been centered on Bahrain, although it seems to have extended to parts of Kuwait, eastern Saudi Arabia, and Qatar as well.” As for its mythical garden and sweet-smelling waters, those have yet to be discovered.
3. Baiae
Everyone needs a place to let off steam; for the emperors and wealthy playboys of the ancient world, the city of Baiae, located on the northern edge of the Bay of Naples in Italy, served this purpose from the first century B.C. through the fifth century A.D. Unfortunately for us, and thanks to its location in a volatile volcanic area, at least half of the ancient city was submerged by the eighth century A.D. It’s not so much, archaeologist Dr. Kristina Killgrove told me, that we don’t know where it is, we just can’t get to it. She told me that this hidden trove of “villas of the ancient rich and famous” was attractive to early 19th century poets like Keats and Shelley, who talk about the lost wonders of Baiae. Presumably these included important and gorgeous ancient artwork like wall frescoes, artifacts, and sculptures.
Some excavation in the area has been done and modern tourists can also visit the underwater archaeological park . Killgrove said that hopefully more excavation in this area at in the future could “help us learn more about how emperors and other important Romans worked and played.”
4. The Lost City of Kalahari
In 1885 Guillermo Farini (a pseudonym of William Leonard Hunt), a former entertainer at Coney Island in New York, crossed a section of the Kalahari that had previously been unexplored by Westerners. Naturally, Farini was actually looking for diamonds. In the book he published upon his return, Farini claimed that he had come across the ruins of building, a remnant of an unknown civilization. In his book (and, I kid you not, in somewhat patronizing poetry) he described “A half-buried ruin - a huge wreck of stones/ On a lone and desolate spot;/ A temple - or a tomb for human bones/ Left by men to decay and rot. Rude sculptured blocks/ from the red sand project,/ And shapeless uncouth stones appear,/ Some great man's ashes designed to protect,/ Buried many a thousand year.” His claims were supported by photographs and sketches taken and made by his son during the trip. The legend of the lost city of Kalahari had its origin in local legends in which construction on the city was abandoned because the region was inhospitable. Farini’s “discovery” spawned a South African legend. Others claimed that they too had seen the tell-tale signs of civilization. People compared the discovery to the archaeological discoveries at Great Zimbabwe , a ruined city that flourished from the 11th to the 15th centuries in the southeastern hills of Zimbabwe.
In the early 20th century no fewer than 25 expeditions were undertaken to find the site. F. R. Paver and Dr. W. M. Borcherds used World War II-era reconnaissance aircraft to scour the region, but with no success. In the 1960s Professor A. J. Clement attempted to retrace Farini’s steps. He discovered a set of monumental rocks that seemed suggestive of man-made walls, but they were actually a 180 million-year-old geological feature. Geologists who saw the photographs made by Clement’s team suggested that the rocks were made of dolerite, a kind of igneous rock that, as it erodes, can produce the appearance of regular blocks. Clement concluded that Farini had discovered a natural rock formation and mistaken it for a ruined city. He wrote, “Like all legends, that of the Lost City will be a long time a-dying, and doubtless there will still be some who are disinclined to let the matter rest in spite of all the contrary evidence. And possibly this is just as well, for there is something rather sad about the destruction of a legend.”
Most recently, in 2016, a Travel Channel-sponsored expedition to the region hosted by Josh Gates discovered some artificially constructed walls and artwork in the area that may match Farini’s description. Has Kalahari’s Lost City been discovered and does it exist? The jury is still out.
Discovering a ruined ancient city does rather seem like the archaeological equivalent of winning an Olympic gold, but those who have ambitions of rediscovering fallen civilizations should get their vaccinations and protective charms in order. The fate that awaits those who rediscover lost parts of the ancient world is usually an unhappy one.
Howard Carter and his team were struck down by the Mummy’s Curse after opening the tomb of Tutankhamun: first Lord Canarvon died of an infected mosquito bite; several others were blinded and killed; the house of Sir Bruce Ingram (an early visitor to the tomb) burned down. And Douglas Preston and his group acquired a flesh-eating bacteria after their trip to the Honduras. Opening the gates to the past comes with some considerable health risks. READ THIS LIST"

Health Minister David Clark is pleased to mark World Health Day today as new figures show cheaper doctors visits are available to nearly all the New Zealanders the policy was intended to reach.
This year for World Health Day the World Health Organisation (WHO) is focusing on universal health coverage.
This is a great day to note that more New Zealanders can see their doctor at an affordable cost, thanks to the Governments cheaper doctors visits initiatives launched in December last year, David Clark said.
As of April 1, approximately 96 per cent of Community Services Card (CSC) holders and their dependants who are enrolled with a general practice are able to visit their doctor at low cost. Those not already enrolled with a very low cost access practice will on average pay $20 to $30 less for a consultation. This means almost all Kiwis who hold a CSC wont be charged more than $18.50 to visit their doctor.
We know that cost has been a barrier for nearly 600,000 New Zealanders when they need to see their doctor. For some, their health has deteriorated until they needed to go to hospital. This isnt good enough and Im proud of the fact this Government has done something about it.
All general practices in the Northland, Lakes, Tairawhiti, Bay of Plenty, Hawkes Bay, Whanganui, Hutt Valley, Wairarapa, West Coast and South Canterbury DHB regions have opted to provide lower-cost visits to their eligible patients with a CSC.
Im particularly pleased to see that more than 96 per cent of Mori and over 97 per cent of Pacific people who are CSC holders are enrolled with practices that offer lower cost fees.
David Clark says the Zero Fees for Under 14s scheme, which was part of Labours coalition agreement with New Zealand First, is also helping make primary care more accessible.
Almost all (more than 99 per cent) of enrolled children aged 13 and under can now access zero fee general practice visits.
Zero Fees for Under 14s is helping deliver on our priority of ensuring all children in New Zealand have access to the primary health care services they need to reach their full potential.
'I'd also like to acknowledge the commitment of the primary care sector to implement the initiatives so promptly. The initiatives positive outcomes wouldn't be possible without the sector's broad support and hard work,' says David Clark.
BACKGROUND
The initiatives include:
People with a CSC, and their dependants aged 14 to 17 years, who are enrolled with a general practice will pay less for visits to see a doctor or nurse at their general practice. An adult with a CSC wont pay more than $18.50 for a standard visit with a doctor or nurse and young people aged 14 to 17 years, who have a parent or caregiver with a CSC, will be charged no more than $12.50.
All enrolled children aged 13 and under wont be charged a fee for a standard visit with a doctor or nurse at their general practice. They also wont be charged an after-hours fee at participating clinics or pharmacies or the regular $5 prescription fee.
Its anticipated that from 1 April 2019:
91 per cent of non-very low cost access (VLCA) practices will have signed up to the CSC initiative.
94 per cent of practices (including the above non-VLCA and all VLCA practices) will be offering low-cost services to their enrolled CSC holders and dependants.
96 per cent of CSC holders and dependants who are enrolled with a general practice will be able to visit their enrolled practice at low cost.
These figures will be confirmed by mid-April 2019, following final analysis. More Kiwis able to access lower-cost primary health care More Kiwis able to access lower-cost primary health care Beehive 7th April 2019, 16:38 GMT+10

Zero Fees for Under 14s is helping deliver on our priority of ensuring all children in New Zealand have access to the primary health care services they need to reach their full potential.
'I'd also like to acknowledge the commitment of the primary care sector to implement the initiatives so promptly. The initiatives positive outcomes wouldn't be possible without the sector's broad support and hard work,' says David Clark.
BACKGROUND
The initiatives include:
People with a CSC, and their dependants aged 14 to 17 years, who are enrolled with a general practice will pay less for visits to see a doctor or nurse at their general practice. An adult with a CSC wont pay more than $18.50 for a standard visit with a doctor or nurse and young people aged 14 to 17 years, who have a parent or caregiver with a CSC, will be charged no more than $12.50.
All enrolled children aged 13 and under wont be charged a fee for a standard visit with a doctor or nurse at their general practice. They also wont be charged an after-hours fee at participating clinics or pharmacies or the regular $5 prescription fee.
Its anticipated that from 1 April 2019:
91 per cent of non-very low cost access (VLCA) practices will have signed up to the CSC initiative.
94 per cent of practices (including the above non-VLCA and all VLCA practices) will be offering low-cost services to their enrolled CSC holders and dependants.
96 per cent of CSC holders and dependants who are enrolled with a general practice will be able to visit their enrolled practice at low cost.
These figures will be confirmed by mid-April 2019, following final analysis. Read This Next"

Education Committee chair and senior Brexiteer Robert Halfon has said that “It feels like the Commons is having a collective breakdown — a cross between Lord of the Flies and One Flew over the Cuckoos Nest.”
In comments reported by London’s Evening Standard , the Tory MP went on to say, “People are behaving in ways that were unimaginable even just a year ago, whether they be Remainers, Leavers or in-betweens. The Brexit madness has affected us all”.
Mr Halfon is not the only Member of Parliament to express such concerns, with one female MP telling The Sun that parliament had become a “boiling pot of mental ill health”.
One male MP was reportedly reduced to tears after finding out he won’t be able to go home to see his children next week, due to the cancellation of MP’s Easter recess.
Comments made to a BBC radio programme by Members of Parliament claim Brexit was leading to politicians drinking more and avoiding people. One said it was “taking an emotional toil”.
House of Commons Deputy Speaker Lindsay Hoyle has told all MPs in an email on Thursday that “Members of Parliament, Parliamentary staff and House employees are all human and it is vital that in times of heightened stress in the workplace we can access the necessary health and well-being support.”
He added, “Members of Parliament and staff are resilient but Brexit has meant we are all working very long hours for extended periods of time whilst facing extraordinary pressure.”
Mr Hoyle reminded MPs of services available to aid with mental health issues and stress including a confidential 24-hour helpline.

— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) April 6, 2019
MPs are not the only ones apparently suffering stress and mental health issues due to the ongoing Brexit debacle, with civil servants reportedly offered Cognitive Behavioural counselling.
The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) has reportedly spent £40,000 on the service for staff members in Bristol, York and London. A spokesman said, “The health, safety and wellbeing of our staff is always a priority for Defra and we have a range of services on offer to support staff’s mental health.
“This short-term contract expired at the end of January and bolstered our own wellbeing services for two months while we made changes to our existing employee support.”
Meanwhile, a ‘Britain Thinks’ poll has found that 64 percent of the public have claimed that the ongoing Brexit situation is damaging their mental health. The survey of more than 2,000 people said that the words most commonly associated with the Brexit process were now “broken” and “chaos”, reports The Guardian .
These revelations come as Theresa May seeks another extension to the United Kingdom’s departure date from the EU, hoping to extend Brexit until June 30th, which would mean contesting European Parliament elections , due in May.
In further bad news for already fragile Members of Parliament, EU Council President Donald Tusk has called for an even longer “flexible extension” of up to a year, saying, “We could give the UK a year-long extension, automatically terminated once the Withdrawal Agreement has been accepted and ratified by the House of Commons.”

The April 2 news article (""Women charged in massage-parlor raids"") highlights the good work of the police and the disturbing issue of human trafficking under the guise of “massage.” The business name Xin Xin Foot Reflexology hits a nerve with me and my reflexology colleagues because legitimate reflexologists have a shadow cast upon them each time something like this happens.
The Reflexology Association of Rhode Island (reflexologyri.com) and the Reflexology Association of America (reflexology-usa.org) take incidents like this very seriously. We want the public to know: reflexology has been in existence since 2330 BC; reflexologists attend rigorous 300-hour training; reflexology is not massage therapy but a standalone modality that uses manual techniques applied to specific reflex areas predominantly on the hands and feet; and you can find legitimate reflexologists on the RARI website.
We all have a role in preventing human trafficking and the best approach is an informed approach.

My wife and I are just finishing up our extended annual vacation in Florida where we keep connected daily with our online Providence Journal subscription.
It is from this perspective that one can really appreciate the absurd comedy that is Rhode Island — from the near-daily hysteria of lefties who remain convinced that our president is a Russian agent to our governor who not only can’t stop spending taxpayers' money but who also has yet to get anything right.
In these parts, where there are no potholes, things are booming and people are happy. The economy really is on fire even though in Rhode Island the politicians are holding firm against doing anything that might help businesses flourish.
If the citizens of our small state could get to see their state from a distance, they might realize what a mess things are. After all, you can’t fix a problem until you know you’ve got one.

I strongly disagree with your March 28 editorial ""Moderate Democrats rule Rhode Island."" Characterizing progressives as ""the far left wing of the Democratic Party"" shows your bias toward ideas that put people ahead of CEOs, corporations and the wealthy. House Speaker Nicholas Mattiello is a dictator to whom many defer lest they be banished from any meaningful participation in the Rhode Island House.
Want to see where our state representatives really are? How about having a secret ballot vote for speaker? It will never happen, just as commonsense gun regulations will never happen. That is because the speaker who was rated A-plus by the National Rifle Association four out of the last five years, falling to B-plus last year, controls anything coming to the floor that could undermine NRA and affiliated donations.
Rhode Island's General Assembly is Democratic in name only. To believe anything else is folly.

With each passing day we hear more about the healthful effects of marijuana use. We're told that marijuana can help address problems with anxiety, addiction, Alzheimer's, AIDS/HIV, arthritis, depression, insomnia, stress and even dull, otherwise intractable pain from cancer and other incurable diseases better than any current medications. I've even read that marijuana use can help people lose considerable weight.
What are we waiting for? Why would we continue to treat patients with addictive opioids for pain complaints and with dangerous benzodiazepines for anxiety relief and insomnia when we have marijuana that can address all these concerns more effectively?
Imagine finally ending our opioid epidemic and our endless war on drugs by turning to one purportedly healthy alternative. Imagine converting all of our methadone and suboxone clinics into healthy marijuana dispensaries.
Well, I guess for now, they're just wild imaginings. As for marijuana being used as a weight-loss remedy, heroin, crack and methamphetamines also do the trick, but I wouldn't recommend using them, at least not without a prescription.

More than 12,000 raucous college hockey fans livened up the Dunkin' Center last weekend enjoying two exciting Providence College wins. Hosted by Brown University, the NCAA East Regional hockey tournament featured the Friars and their outstanding pep band and teams representing Minnesota State, Cornell and Northeastern.
About every four years, the Dunk is fortunate to host a postseason NCAA regional hockey tournament. This year the Dunk, despite $48 pricey tickets mandated by the NCAA, had the highest attendance of any of the four regional sites in the country.
Why not have the Dunk host every year a regular-season college hockey doubleheader featuring PC and Brown and two archrivals from Boston? An annual doubleheader featuring PC-Boston College and Brown-Harvard on a Friday or Saturday night would draw 8,000-10,000 fans with $15-$18 ticket prices.
The benefits of such an annual college hockey doubleheader? The local teams would net more money than hosting these traditional rivals at their own rinks. The event also would boost awareness of local college hockey and boost attendance at PC and Brown’s rinks, and enliven downtown Providence.

Kudos to Barbara Fenton, wife of two-time Republican gubernatorial candidate Allan Fung, for resigning from the GOP state committee after the election of Sue Cienki as chairperson. This is the foul-mouthed former president of the East Greenwich Town Council. The same person who illegally named a town manager in violation of open meetings law, and was overruled in court. The same person who took an almost all-Republican Town Council and lost every seat in the last election, despite East Greenwich's historically being a Republican town.
Now the leaders have turned to her to increase their minuscule representation in the state legislature. Good luck! If she is as successful in her new position as she was in her last one, Republicans in the State House will be fewer than dinosaurs or woolly mammoths.

Should Joe Biden be eliminated for running for president because he kissed a woman on the top of her head and rubbed noses with another woman? He would be running against President Trump, a man who was caught on tape bragging that women would let him touch them in an area that cannot be mentioned in mixed company. Trump had to pay off women with whom he allegedly had sexual relationships while married.
Biden should certainly give a further explanation and apology for his handling of the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing of Anita Hill's accusations against Clarence Thomas, but please, give me a break about these other incidents.

Iran's Khamenei Tells Iraq: Eject U.S. Troops 'as Soon as Possible',www.breitbart.com,breitbart.com,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.breitbart.com/middle-east/2019/04/07/irans-khamenei-tells-iraq-eject-u-s-troops-as-soon-as-possible/," Iran’s Khamenei Tells Iraq: Eject U.S. Troops ‘as Soon as Possible’ BEHROUZ MEHRI/AFP/Getty SIMON KENT 7 Apr 2019 Iran’s leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei urged Iraq on Saturday to demand U.S. troops leave its soil “as soon as possible.” The call came after a visit by Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi intended to enhance Tehran’s influence with its neighboring Arab country. The website of the Iranian supreme leader Quote: s him as telling Abdul-Mahdi that Iraq’s government should take measures to remove American forces quickly. He says the longer the U.S. forces are there, the more difficult it will be to remove them:
You must make sure that the Americans withdraw their troops from Iraq as soon as possible because expelling them has become difficult whenever they have had a long military presence in a country.
The Iraqi government, parliament and current political activists in the country are undesirable for the Americans … and they are plotting to remove them from Iraqi politics.
Some 5,200 troops are stationed in Iraq as part of a security agreement with the Iraqi government to advise, assist and support the country’s troops in the fight against Islamic State influence.
Tehran sees the U.S. military presence at its doorstep in Iraq as a threat — one that could also undermine Iran’s sway over Baghdad.
During Abdul Mahdi’s visit, President Rouhani called for Iran and Iraq to expand their gas and electricity dealings and boost bilateral trade to $20 billion.
“The plans to export electricity and gas and hopefully oil continue and we are ready to expand these contacts not only for the two countries but also for other countries in the region,” Rouhani said in remarks carried by state TV.
Rouhani also hailed Iran and Iraq’s shared stance on regional issues including Israel.
“We hold common viewpoints on Al-Quds [Jerusalem] being the permanent capital of Palestine, Golan being an inseparable part of Syria and that the war in Yemen should finish soon and that the solution to the Yemeni crisis should be a political one,” he said.
The leader added that the two countries “agreed upon the necessity of peace and stability in the entire region”.
Washington has previously criticized the Iraqi government for refusing to comply with a second round of U.S. economic sanctions targeting Iran’s crucial energy, shipping and banking sectors, as Breitbart News reported .
Iraq has also drawn rebukes for tolerating the existence of pro-Iraq militias known as the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF) which are helping are helping Iran expand its activities inside the country.

(AFP pic)
ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi Sunday claimed his government had reliable intelligence that India was planning to carry out aggression against Pakistan between April 16 and 20.
Relations between the nuclear-armed neighbours nose-dived after a suicide bombing in Indian-administered Kashmir in February killed 40 Indian security personnel and was later claimed by a Pakistan-based militant group.
Pakistan has denied any role in the attack and Prime Minister Imran Khan offered cooperation in the investigation if credible evidence was provided by India.
Talking to reporters in the southern city of Multan, Qureshi said the ambassadors of the permanent members of the UN Security Council in Islamabad had been informed about “the plan” two days ago.
“We have reliable intelligence that India has made a new scheme and the planning is underway and there are chances of another aggression against Pakistan and according to our information this action can take place between April 16 and 20,” he said.
“I am saying it with responsibility and I have a responsible position, I know each word I say would make headlines in the international press,” he said, stressing the reliability of his claim.
He said the planned aggression was aimed at “increasing diplomatic pressure against Pakistan”.
Days after the Kashmir bombing, New Delhi – which has long accused Islamabad of harbouring militants who launch attacks on its soil – demanded Pakistan take “credible and visible action”.
Soon after it launched a cross-border air raid on Pakistan that kicked off a quick succession of attacks and dogfights between the arch-rivals over the disputed Kashmir frontier that spurred fears of wider war erupting.
Pakistani and Indian soldiers have continued to fire over the Line of Control – the de-facto border dividing Kashmir, killing several civilians on both sides.
Kashmir has been divided between India and Pakistan since the end of British colonial rule in 1947.
Both claim the Himalayan territory in full and have fought two wars over it. "
Saudi Aramco set for mega debt deal pitched by JP Morgan’s Dimon,www.freemalaysiatoday.com,Bloomberg,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/business/2019/04/07/saudi-aramco-set-for-mega-debt-deal-pitched-by-jp-morgans-dimon/,"Saudi Aramco set for mega debt deal pitched by JP Morgan’s Dimon By - April 7, 2019 4:35 PM Apart from JP Morgan’s CEO Jamie Dimon (pictured), the bond sale is also being managed by Morgan Stanley, Citigroup Inc, Goldman Sachs Group, HSBC Holdings and NCB Capital. (Bloomberg pic)
BRUSSELS: In a bond sale closely watched by investors globally, Saudi Aramco and its bankers are preparing to kick off what could be at least a US$10 billion offering next week. Early indications suggest investors are already crowding in.
A message circulated among investors on Friday said interest in the most highly anticipated sale of the year already totalled more than US$26 billion, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter.
The state-owned oil giant and bankers spent the last week drumming up support for its debut offering at presentations in cities ranging from New York and Chicago to Singapore and Tokyo.
The success of the sale is hugely important for banks, such as JP Morgan Chase & Co, that are working on the company’s behalf.
They are eager to run an initial public offering by Aramco – the world’s most profitable company – if and when it comes, which would bring lucrative fees for the selected banks.
In a rare appearance that underlines the bond sale’s significance, JP Morgan’s chief executive officer Jamie Dimon spoke at a lunch in New York Thursday to market the deal, according to one of the people.
Price talk
Morgan Stanley, Citigroup Inc, Goldman Sachs Group, HSBC Holdings and NCB Capital are also managing the bond sale, according to a prospectus seen by Bloomberg News.
The initial price talk on the bond may be announced on Monday, with pricing as early as Tuesday, the people said. Representatives of the company declined to comment on the sale process.
“It will be definitely a jumbo deal with at least four tranches,” said Sergey Dergachev senior portfolio manager at Union Investment Privatfonds GmbH in Frankfurt. “Demand should be huge.” He speculated that demand could even surpass the record US$53 billion in bids that Qatar received for its US$12 billion bond sale last year.
Aramco is turning to the dollar bond market as the company is starting to raise cash ahead of the purchase of a US$69 billion majority stake in domestic petrochemical giant Sabic.
The bond sale represents an alternate way for Saudi Arabia to raise money and diversify from oil after an IPO of Aramco was postponed last year. Saudi Arabia has valued Aramco at a whopping US$2 trillion, though not all investors are convinced it’s worth that much.
Torn investors
The bond sale will extend the already record start for issuers from the Gulf Cooperation Council – exceeding US$30 billion so far this year.
It caps four consecutive years of bond sales from the Kingdom, most recently pricing US$7.5 billion in international bonds in January, only months since the brutal killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi.
While demand for the bonds is likely to be high, investors remain torn on whether that interest will allow Aramco to pay yields lower than what its owner does, the Saudi Arabia government.
On the one hand, Aramco is immensely profitable and produces endless cash flow. In addition, investors who manage high-grade corporate debt are showing interest in buying the Aramco bonds.
All of that could bring the borrowing cost lower than that of the government, according to Nikolay Menteshashvili, an analyst with Insight Investment in London.
But others see it differently. They say Aramco is inextricably linked to the Saudi government, which is subject to a variety of risks including low oil prices.
That’s why Jim Barrineau, head of emerging-market debt at Schroders Plc, said he wouldn’t be interested in buying Aramco’s bonds at a rate lower than the government’s.
“For an emerging market investor, it’s just the level relative to the sovereign that matters,” Barrineau said. "
Ethiopians bid farewell to slain rapper Nipsey Hussle,www.freemalaysiatoday.com,AFP,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/leisure/2019/04/07/ethiopians-bid-farewell-to-slain-rapper-nipsey-hussle/,"Ethiopians bid farewell to slain rapper Nipsey Hussle By April 7, 2019 4:30 PM Nipsey Hussle (Reuters picture)
With poems and speeches, Ethiopians have held an emotional farewell for murdered rapper Nipsey Hussle, whose roots in neighbouring Eritrea won him admirers in both countries.
Known for his Grammy-nominated debut album, Hussle was shot dead last week in front of the clothing store he owned in the US city of Los Angeles, whose violence-plagued neighbourhoods he had tried to revitalise.
On Friday, 29-year-old Eric Holder pleaded not guilty to murder and attempted murder over the shooting that also wounded two other men.
At the Saturday evening memorial in the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa, Hussle was remembered as a rare entertainer who bridged his American upbringing with his roots in the Horn of Africa.
“When we heard there’s an Eritrean rapper out there, we were fans before we heard his music,” said Ambaye Michael Tesfay, who eulogised Hussle at the event held in a darkened parking lot. “He was an icon for us.”
Before his 2018 debut album “Victory Lap” scored a Grammy nomination for Best Rap Album, Hussle, born Ermias Asghedom, had won the attention of rap fans from both Ethiopia and Eritrea for his embrace of his father’s Eritrean heritage.
Eritrea was a province of Ethiopia until 1993, when it voted for independence after a decades-long independence struggle, but both countries still have close cultural and family ties.
“It’s just really tragic what happened,” said Tezeta Solomon, an Ethiopian living in Los Angeles who attended the memorial in Addis Ababa.
“When he first came out, we were all so excited. To know there was a habesha rapper out there definitely sparked some pride,” she said, using a common term to describe people from the Horn of Africa.
Hussle embraced his Eritrean heritage, visiting the country last year and telling state media, “More than anything I am proud of being Eritrean.”
The relationship between Ethiopia and Eritrea has often been tortuous, and the countries were not on speaking terms for years following a 1998-2000 border war that ground into stalemate.
That ended with the signing of a peace agreement last year that restored ties between the neighbours.
The frosty relations did little to dampen Ethiopians’ pride in Hussle’s success.
“We’re all one people,” said Nemany Hailemelekot, an organiser of the memorial.
The crowd of hundreds gathered in the parking lot observed a moment of silence for the slain rapper, who was 33.
Then by the light of candle-like sticks known as twafs held by attendees, speakers came onto a stage erected before the crowd to eulogise Hussle and read poems in his honour. "
IRB extends voluntary disclosure programme,www.freemalaysiatoday.com,FMT Reporters,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2019/04/07/irb-extends-voluntary-disclosure-programme/,"IRB extends voluntary disclosure programme By - April 7, 2019 4:29 PM The IRB’s Special Voluntary Disclosure Programme is aimed at encouraging taxpayers to come clean and start afresh from their 2018 assessment year.
KUALA LUMPUR: The Inland Revenue Board (IRB) has decided to extend the Special Voluntary Disclosure Programme (SVDP), aimed at encouraging taxpayers to come clean on their undeclared income, after it received “very encouraging” response from the taxpayers.
The IRB had received 381,979 voluntary disclosures up till March 31, Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng said.
The voluntary disclosures are for the 2017 reporting year for individuals, and the year ending March 31, 2018 for companies.
Under this voluntary programme, a reduced penalty of 10% was offered for under-reported income disclosed to the IRB from November 2018 till March 31, 2019. This has now been extended to June 30.
In a statement today, Lim said under the scheme’s second phase, from July 1 till Sept 30 this year, taxpayers will be imposed a 15% penalty.
From Oct 1 this year, the penalty will revert back to 45% onwards, Lim said.
The SVDP is to encourage taxpayers, especially those with offshore accounts, to come forward voluntarily and declare income not reported previously or which was under-reported for tax purposes.
It aims to provide an avenue for taxpayers to come clean in relation to their tax affairs and start afresh from the 2018 assessment year, the IRB had said previously.
Lim said the IRB will accept each voluntary disclosure in good faith.
Audit action and investigation will not be conducted against the taxpayer.
He hoped more taxpayers would take advantage of the programme to enjoy the low penalty rates and reduce their tax burden.
Lim said the IRB had complied with the government’s instructions last year that investigations into tax cases be conducted without threats and to stop raids on houses or offices by IRB officers accompanied by armed personnel “wearing balaclava masks”.
If this order is defied, he said the victimised party should lodge a complaint with the IRB or the ministry. "

WASHINGTON: Wayne Rooney was sent off as DC United’s unbeaten start to the season came to an emphatic end with a 4-0 home defeat to Los Angeles FC on Saturday.
Former England and Manchester United star Rooney was shown a red card on 52 minutes after a dangerous, studs-up tackle on LAFC’s Uruguayan striker Diego Rossi, who would go on to complete a clinical hat-trick.
Referee Robert Sibiga initially looked to have given Rooney a reprieve, brandishing only a yellow card for the tackle.
But after consulting the Video Assistant Referee, Sibiga changed the yellow to red, leaving United skipper Rooney to trudge off the field without protest.
“Yeah I think it was a red card,” Rooney said after the game. “I’ve lunged. I tried to win the ball, and I’ve caught the player. I have no arguments.”
Rooney’s red completed a miserable afternoon for DC United, who by that stage were trailing 3-0 against a vastly superior LAFC side.
The eagerly anticipated battle between the leading teams in the Eastern Conference and Western Conference turned into a one-sided affair at Washington’s Audi Field, with Los Angeles ruthlessly exploiting some sloppy play from the home side.
The game was effectively over in little more than half an hour, with Los Angeles surging into a 3-0 lead thanks to two goals from Rossi and a curling effort from Mexico international Carlos Vela.
United had been under pressure from the outset, and was fortunate not to have gone a goal down after only nine minutes when Leonardo Jara was adjudged to have handled in the area to concede a penalty.
Vela stepped up for the spot-kick but was thwarted by a fine block from United goalkeeper Bill Hamid. Vela’s attempted follow-up from the rebound hit a post.
Los Angeles did not have long to wait for the opener, however, and in the 16th minute, Vela made amends with the game’s opening goal.
A mix-up in midfield saw D.C. United cough up possession cheaply, allowing Adama Diomande to thread a pass through to Vela, who coolly took his time before placing a curling shot beyond Hamid.
Vela turned creator for LAFC’s second, picking out Rossi with a delightful low cross with the outside of his left foot allowing the Uruguayan to jab home the finish for 2-0.
Rossi added his second in the 32nd minute, capitalising on good work from Mark Anthony Kaye to curl in a superb right-foot finish to all but seal the win.
Rooney’s dismissal early in the second half snuffed out any faint hope of a comeback, and Rossi duly added insult to injury by completing his hat-trick to make it 4-0 on 76 minutes.
LAFC moved four points clear of Los Angeles Galaxy at the top of the Western Conference, with 16 points from six games. "

(Reuters pic)
KIGALI: Rwandans will gather on Sunday to begin a solemn commemoration of the lives of 800,000 Tutsi and moderate Hutus murdered during the Rwandan genocide, a three-month-killing spree that began 25 years ago.
The ceremony marks the beginning of a week of events to honour the dead.
Rwandan President Paul Kagame is scheduled to lay a wreath at Gisozi genocide memorial site, where over a quarter a million of people are buried.
In the afternoon, officials will join around 2,000 people in a “walk to remember” from parliament to the national soccer stadium, where candles will be lit in a night vigil.
At least 10 heads of state were expected to attend, Stephanie Nyombayire, head of communication at the president’s office, told journalists on Saturday.
Canadian Governor General Julie Payette and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker were also expected.
The 100 days of slaughter began on April 6, 1994, after President Juvenal Habyarimana and his counterpart Cyprien Ntaryamira of Burundi – both Hutus – were killed when their plane was shot down over the Rwandan capital. The attackers have never been identified.
The attack mobilised Hutu government soldiers and allied extremist militia, who orchestrated the genocide to exterminate the Tutsi minority.
In villages across the densely populated country, neighbour turned on neighbour as men, women and children were hacked to death, burned alive, clubbed and shot.
As many as 10,000 people were killed daily. 70% of the minority Tutsi population was wiped out, and over 10% of the total Rwandan population.
The fighting ended in July 1994 when the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), a Tutsi-led rebel movement led by Kagame, swept in from Uganda and seized control of the country.
Official policy is to strongly discourage any talk of ethnicity, but the opposition says the tight control of the media and political sphere is also used to stifle dissent, something the government denies. "

(Reuters pic)
PETALING JAYA: The G25 group of eminent Malays has expressed its disappointment that the government has yielded to pressure from dissenting groups and decided to withdraw from the Rome Statute soon after acceding to it.
In a statement today, it said this was the second time that the government has made a U-turn, the first being the withdrawal from its decision to accede to the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD).
“This is troubling because it creates the impression that Malaysia is ruled by racial and religious sentiments, not by universal standards of justice.
“It also brings into question the new government’s commitment to reforms.”
G25 said it was understandable for Prime Minister Dr Mahathir Mohamad to be upset at those responsible for spreading confusion over this international convention and misleading the public, especially the Malays, that the Rome Statute will undermine the sovereignty of the country and the dignity of the Malay Rulers and Islam.
Under the statute, the International Criminal Court (ICC) is empowered to institute proceedings against individuals for the international crimes of genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity, and crimes of aggression when a country is unable or unwilling to charge its nationals for the commission of any of those crimes.
“In other words, the ICC is a court of last resort.
“We in G25 cannot understand why there are concerns that the Rome Statute will place our Sultans and the Yang di-Pertuan Agung and Islam at risk of being subjected to international law as they are constitutional monarchs who rule on the advice of the government.
“On the other hand, if any Sultan is responsible for a serious crime, he will be brought to justice under our national law.
“There is no need to refer the matter to the ICC as our royal families have no immunity from criminal charges, unlike some countries which exempt their royalty from criminal punishment.”
G25 said if political leaders or royals commit crimes against humanity on a barbaric scale, and no action is taken to make them accountable, then it is right and proper for the international community to intervene and bring them to justice at the ICC so that the people will be spared from future acts of terror.
“For example, the countries which make up the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda are more civilised countries today after the genocides carried out by their previous rulers were exposed to the world at the trials conducted by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia at The Hague and the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda in Arusha.
“These trials were initiated by international resolutions at the United Nations.”
G25 called upon the government to encourage the Rome Statute to be discussed and debated at all levels of society, in the media, in university campuses and in civil society forums, in the kampungs and cities.
“When the time is right, and after the country has a much better understanding of the treaty, the matter can be brought up to Parliament for a final decision, based on the will of the people, as reflected by their elected representatives, on whether to accede to, or reject the treaty, and to abide by that decision.
“That is how a parliamentary democracy works.”
G25 said the experience in other countries shows that, however contentious an issue, the public will come to accept the final decision when the people are satisfied that all layers of opinions have been consulted through open dialogues and debates.
“It is true that some policy changes may be tough for some groups to accept, but when the majority have spoken through a proper parliamentary process, they must accept that decision,” it added. "

(Pic from Sydney Cricket Ground website)
SYDNEY: Australia’s football players’ union Sunday demanded an investigation into the “deplorable” Sydney Cricket Ground pitch after midfielder Terry Antonis suffered a potentially serious knee injury during an A-League game.
Antonis collapsed to the ground in the second half of the match on Saturday between Melbourne Victory and Sydney FC after slipping on the uneven surface when no-one else was around him.
Professional Footballers Australia chief executive John Didulica said the pitch was in a “deplorable state” and clearly dangerous as he demanded answers from Football Federation Australia as to how the game was allowed to go ahead.
“The players confirmed with us last night that they were not consulted at any stage on whether or not the match should proceed, notwithstanding the clear issues that the pitch presented to their livelihoods,” he said.
“As demonstrated, cricket wickets present an unreasonable danger to the health and safety of footballers and it remains the view of the PFA that players are under no obligation to participate in matches when such risks are present.”
The iconic cricket ground is being used for soccer and rugby while the neighbouring Sydney Football Stadium is demolished and rebuilt.
Last month, large sections of the hallowed turf was ripped apart during a Super Rugby game between the NSW Waratahs and Queensland Reds.
Management were forced to replace 3,000 square metres of grass afterwards in preparation for a rugby league match.
Sydney FC chief Danny Townsend said the pitch “clearly wasn’t up to the standards required for professional football” and said the club could move its next match elsewhere.
Victory coach Kevin Muscat said it was too early to assess Antonis’ injury, but he has been ruled out of their AFC Champions League clash with Guangzhou Evergrande in China this week.
“That simply is not good enough,” he said of the pitch. “Not for the contest tonight (Saturday), not for anything.”
Sydney won the game 2-1. "

KOTA KINABALU: A teenager has been arrested in Taiping for threatening to circulate semi-naked photos he obtained through Instagram from a 15-year-old girl in Sabah’s southwestern Beaufort district.
The 18-year-old had befriended the Form Four student through the social media app last month and introduced himself as an agent scouting for new models.
Beaufort police chief Azmir Abd Razak said the suspect, using the account name Fordhaneem, offered the girl the opportunity to model for his “agency”.
He said the suspect even sent the girl a form to fill through Instagram.
When that was settled, he asked her to send nude photos of herself to select the size of clothes. The girl only sent him semi-naked pictures.
The girl became suspicious when the suspect insisted on her sending full naked photos of herself and decided not to entertain his subsequent messages.
Azmir said the girl then received a WhatsApp text from someone named “Harith” who claimed that he had obtained the photos from Fordhaneem.
“‘Harith’ said he could help stop the photos from being spread online but she had to pay him RM500 first. If she failed to do so, he threatened to release the photos and these could go viral.
“The girl, however, did not make the payment because she suspected Harith and Fordhaneem were the same person.”
After the girl lodged a police report, Azmir said police tracked down the suspect to Taiping.
The suspect has been remanded for six days.
Police are now probing if the suspect is involved in similar cases reported in other states. "
Tourist numbers double at North Korea marathon,www.freemalaysiatoday.com,AFP,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/leisure/2019/04/07/tourist-numbers-double-at-north-korea-marathon/,"Tourist numbers double at North Korea marathon By April 7, 2019 3:30 PM Kim Jong Un, North Korea’s leader.

SEOUL: Twice as many foreigners as last year gathered in Pyongyang Sunday for the city’s annual marathon, tour firms said, as reduced tensions see visitor numbers rise in isolated North Korea.
The event – part of the celebrations for the anniversary of founder Kim Il Sung’s birth in 1912 – is the highlight of the North’s tourism calendar and offers the chance to run or jog through the streets of the tightly-controlled city.
Around 950 Westerners entered the event, according to market leader Koryo Tours, compared to some 450 last year when numbers slumped.
That brought participation almost back to the levels of 2017, before tensions soared as the North carried out a series of missile launches and leader Kim Jong Un traded threats and personal insults with US President Donald Trump.
The same year, Washington also banned its citizens from visiting the North following the death of Otto Warmbier, a US student jailed for trying to steal a propaganda poster who died in a mysterious coma days after his release.
Several other countries subsequently raised their travel warnings, a combination of events that dealt a significant blow to the North’s tourism industry.
The US ban remains in place but more Western tourists signed up for the marathon this time, tour operators said, following a year of high-level diplomacy between Trump and Kim.
“As political tensions have subsided, tourism demand has increased,” said Elliott Davies, director at Uri Tours, another operator, adding: “You could plot a graph in this direct relationship.”
‘Marathon chasers’
The vast majority of tourists to the North are Chinese and some 5,000 Westerners a year used to visit the North – with about 20% of those from the US – seeking unique adventures in one of the most closed countries in the world.
The annual race also attracts so-called “Marathon Chasers” who tick off runs around the world, said Matt Kulesza, a senior tour guide at Young Pioneer Tours.
Angel Arnaudov, a 34-year-old engineer from Macedonia, said Pyongyang came onto his “radar” after finishing more than 30 marathons in cities ranging from Tokyo, New York and Copenhagen.
“I want to experience the life in North Korea myself and see if it is like they say on TV or different,” he said, adding he would be posting videos on his Youtube channel.
For third-time participant Jasmine Barrett, the Pyongyang Marathon was an opportunity to interact with ordinary North Koreans who line the streets to cheer on the runners, offering high-fives and posing for selfies.
“I keep coming back because I love to see the smiles on the children’s faces,” the Australian entrepreneur told AFP.
“I’d definitely recommend it to others because it’s a great way to see the city and the people who live there,” she added.
Tour operators advise visitors to take extra precautions about “what to do and what not to do” when travelling in the North.
Simon Cockerell, Koryo Tours’ general manager, said: “This is vital when visiting North Korea and anyone wanting to travel shouldn’t go without a briefing.” "

WASHINGTON: Two weeks after he exonerated President Donald Trump in the Russia meddling investigation, Attorney General Bill Barr faces mounting pressure to show the full evidence behind his decision.
Allegations this week that the US Justice chief downplayed serious evidence of illegal obstruction by Trump in Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s final report are fuelling demands that he release the entire, unexpurgated document to Congress.
News reports, citing unnamed members of Mueller’s staff, said Barr ignored the summaries Mueller’s team prepared for public release, and instead issued his own on March 24, in which he peremptorily cleared the president of any wrongdoing.
And Barr now says he will not release key evidence given to Mueller’s grand jury, a special panel used by prosecutors in politically-sensitive cases. Democrats suspect the evidence could be damning to the president –setting up a legal and political showdown.
The Democrat-led House Judiciary Committee this week prepared to subpoena the full report, a move Barr and the White House will almost certainly contest.
And on Thursday Jerry Nadler, the committee chairman, demanded Barr turn over all communications between his office and Mueller’s, following the reports Mueller’s staff were unhappy with the way Barr presented their conclusions.
Barr’s distillation “appears to minimise the implications of the report as to the president,” said Nadler.
“Releasing the summaries – without delay – would begin to allow the American people to judge the facts for themselves,” Nadler wrote.’
Trump ‘total exoneration’ questioned
At stake is the president’s ability to put the Russia probe behind him and look to 2020 for reelection.
Trump, who declared a “complete and total exoneration” when Barr announced Mueller’s conclusions, said this week that Democrats “are fighting hard to keep the Witch Hunt alive.”
“This is the highest level of Presidential Harassment in the history of our Country!” he tweeted.
On Tuesday, members of Congress might get their first chance to press Barr in public about the Mueller report, when he appears before the House Appropriations Committee in a hearing nominally focused on the Justice Department Budget.
In his four-page summation of the 22-month investigation on March 24, Barr said that Mueller found no evidence of collusion between Trump’s campaign and Russia in the 2016 election, and that there was insufficient evidence to charge Trump with obstruction.
Yet Barr also conceded that Mueller did compile evidence of obstruction, and quoted the special counsel as saying that: “While this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.”
Is Barr protecting Trump?
Suspicions are deep among Democrats that Barr took advantage of his position to clear Trump and now wants to keep the most damaging parts of the report secret to protect the White House.
Trump chose the veteran Republican lawyer to lead the Justice Department after firing his predecessor Jeff Sessions, whom the president resented for recusing himself from oversight of the Russia probe.
In June 2018, with Sessions’s job already known to be imperilled, Barr sent an unsolicited legal memo to the Justice Department and White House strongly criticising the Mueller investigation and its impingement on the president’s prerogatives.
Then a Washington corporate attorney – but without knowledge of the internal work of the Russia probe – Barr declared that “Mueller’s obstruction theory is fatally misconceived” and based on “a novel and legally unsupportable reading of the law.”
The memo only came to light in December after Trump had sacked Sessions and chosen Barr to replace him.
Fight over constitutional powers
So far, Barr has held firm to his stance that he will release this month more of the Mueller report, but stripped of evidence and testimony given to Mueller’s grand jury.
The grand jury material is essential. As is done frequently in such high-profile cases, Mueller used the panel of citizens to develop and hear the evidence and depose key witnesses behind closed doors.
But that evidence is usually kept secret by law unless a prosecutor ultimately decides to level charges in the case.
Democrats argue that Congress, in its constitutional responsibility to enforce the law against the president, has the right to review any evidence against him of wrongdoing, even that of a grand jury.
On Friday, the Justice Department, commenting on a fresh ruling in a case on grand jury secrecy, signalled its stance against that.
“The Department of Justice will continue to defend the long established tradition of protecting grand jury information,” said spokeswoman Kelly Laco. "

SEREMBAN: The Barisan Nasional candidate for the Rantau by-election, Mohamad Hasan, maintained last night that he had not done anything wrong when he transferred RM10 million to buy an asset in London through a money changer 10 years ago.
Mohamad, who was the Negeri Sembilan menteri besar at the time, said the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) had investigated him and welcomed any fresh investigation into the decade-old scandal.
“I’ve been proven innocent,” he told reporters at the BN command centre here today when asked about the issue raised by Negeri Sembilan speaker Zulkefly Mohamad Omar during a Pakatan Harapan ceramah here last night.
Zulkefly had asked why MACC had not taken any action against Mohamad for allegedly violating banking laws by transferring RM10 million to London through a money changer.
Mohamad said the matter should not have been brought up because he had been cleared by the authorities.
He said that besides the MACC, the Attorney-General’s Chambers had cleared him of any wrongdoing.
Then de facto law minister Nancy Shukri had also confirmed the AG’s findings that the transfer of funds did not amount to corruption.
Mohamad said he expected more “provocations” against him and BN in the final week of campaigning for the by-election.
Describing them as “an attempt to kill his character”, he hoped the people could distinguish what was right from wrong.
“If I had done anything wrong during my administration as the menteri besar, lodge a police report.
“Any move to ‘split’ the community, especially by playing up racial issues, should be avoided at all cost,” he said.
Commenting on a call for Umno president Ahmad Zahid Hamidi to return to active politics, Mohamad, the Umno deputy president who is performing the tasks of the president, said he left that to Zahid to decide. "

In a statement, the MACC said it arrested Gnanaraja at 11.40am today at its headquarters in relation to its investigations into money laundering.
“Gnanaraja will face several charges under the Anti-Terrorism Financing and Proceeds of Unlawful Activities Act 2001 (AMLATFPUAA).
“He will be brought to the Sessions Court in Kuala Lumpur on April 8, at 8.30am to face the charges.”
Last week, Gnanaraja was accused of cheating Consortium Zenith Construction Sdn Bhd executive director Zarul Ahmad Mohd Zulkifli of RM19 million between July and August 2017 at various locations in Petaling Jaya and Kuala Lumpur.
Gnanaraja was said to have deceived Zarul into believing that he could help him close money laundering investigations against him by the MACC.
Gnanaraja was first arrested by MACC last year following allegations that he received RM19 million from the main project contractor, Consortium Zenith Construction, to help stop investigations into the company. "

HONG KONG: Malaysian golfer Arie Irawan died of “apparent natural causes” on Sunday in his hotel room on the Chinese resort island of Hainan, the PGA tour said in a statement. He was 28.
Arie, who turned professional in 2013 and won two events on the Asian Development Tour in 2015, had missed the halfway cut at the Sanya Championship, the second event on the PGA Tour China Series.
“The PGA Tour and the China Golf Association grieve at this loss of one of our members and share sincere condolences with Arie’s wife, Marina, and his parents, Ahmad and Jeny,” the PGA tour statement added.
“When something of this magnitude occurs in the golf world, we all grieve at the same time.
“Out of respect for the family, officials cancelled the final round of the Sanya Championship, the tournament becoming a 54-hole event.”
The coroner’s report had not been completed, the statement said.
Arie’s golf career was interrupted in 2016 when he was involved in an accident on a moped and was sidelined for several months. He was ranked 1,366th in the world this week.
He married Marina Malek last May and she sometimes worked as his caddie, even if Arie admitted that she did not know much about golf.
“If I make a bad score, she will say ‘it is okay, it is okay’,” he told Malaysia’s The Star newspaper last year.
“She keeps me calm, relaxed and happy so I just go out there and play golf. That helps me a lot. She has always been there for me through the bad and good times.” "

MEXICO: Victoria Azarenka used her superior serving and punishing groundstrokes to upset top seed Angelique Kerber 6-4 4-6 6-1 and advance to Sunday’s final of the Monterrey Open against Garbine Muguruza.
In a battle of former world number ones the momentum shifted in the Belarusian’s favour early in the third set when Kerber committed two double faults in a careless service game to hand Azarenka a 2-0 lead.
Azarenka seized the opportunity, consolidating the break in the next game before cruising to the finish line to reach her first final in more than three years.
“I’m very pleased with how I played today,” she said in an on-court interview on a warm night in northern Mexico.
“It was an important match and to see how I can do under pressure against a top player,” she said.
“I haven’t won many of those in the last couple years so it’s good that I’m able to turn it around and pick up my level.”
Earlier, second seed Muguruza eased past Slovak Magdalena Rybarikova 6-2 6-3 to book her ticket to the final.
Azarenka came out the victor in her only previous meeting with Spaniard Muguruza, a hard-fought 7-6(6) 7-6(4) win on the hard courts in Miami in 2016. "

NORTH CAROLINA: Ko Jin Young surged from behind to earn a one-stroke lead over Kim In Kyung that could have been higher were it not for some late trouble in the third round of the ANA Inspiration in California on Saturday.
The 23-year-old carded a four-under-par 68 on the difficult Mission Hills course in Rancho Mirage to reel in overnight leader Kim in the first women’s major of the season.
Even a double-bogey at the par-three 14th could not dent Ko’s positive outlook after she posted an eight-under 208 total with one round remaining.
“I had a great round still,” she smiled.
While Ko played a great front nine and an average back nine, it was the opposite for Kim, whose four-shot lead starting the day turned into a four-stroke deficit at the turn.
Kim steadied after her double-bogey at the ninth to shoot a 73, however, playing a bogey-free back nine and finishing in style by sinking a six-foot birdie at the last that left her nipping at the heels of her fellow South Korean.
The 18th is the same hole where Kim missed a one-foot putt in the final round that cost her victory in 2012 in one of the most dramatic moments in major history.
“I played quite well on the back nine. I’m surprised I’m still close to the lead,” said Kim, who eventually put her disappointment behind her to win a different major, the 2017 Women’s British Open.
Another Korean, Lee Mi-hyang (68), was boosted by a hole-in-one from 181 yards at the 17th and jumped into a share of third with American Danielle Kang (70), three shots from the lead.
Ko reeled off six birdies in her first 10 holes and surged to a four-stroke lead until disaster struck at the 14th.
The 124-yard hole required no more than a flick with a wedge, but she struck the ball a little heavy and it failed to clear the pond guarding the green.
Ko dropped two shots and gave renewed hope to her pursuers, who had been watching helplessly in the proverbial rear-view mirror as the Korean threatened to run away with it.
But world number five Ko, imbued with self-belief on the back of recent hot form that has taken her to the top of the LPGA money list, displayed composure beyond her years to keep a positive attitude.
“I’m not robot,” she said. “I’m human. I don’t think about bad things.
“This course is really hard, so anybody can miss a shot.” "

(Reuters pic)
LONDON: As one of the most recognisable public figures in the world, Britain’s Prince William would not make as effective a 007 as legendary fictional spy James Bond.
But that did not stop the heir to the British throne spending the last three weeks working with the security services, including in Bond’s own foreign intelligence unit MI6.
The Duke of Cambridge ended the top-secret attachment – which also included a week with domestic intelligence service MI5 and cybersecurity agency GCHQ – on Saturday, according to Kensington Palace.
“Spending time inside our security and intelligence agencies, understanding more about the vital contribution they make to our national security, was a truly humbling experience,” William said in a statement.
“These agencies are full of people from everyday backgrounds doing the most extraordinary work to keep us safe.”
The prince, who has a military background, began the secondment at the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS) – better known as MI6 –)
whose spies work around the world gathering information and furthering British interests.
William, 36, “got to see first-hand how SIS helps the UK identify and exploit opportunities as well as navigate risks to its national security, military effectiveness and economy,” Kensington Palace said.
The father-of-three then switched over to the Security Service – MI5 – to observe how counter-terrorism teams conduct investigations, including surveillance.
The duke finished his foray into spycraft at the communications monitoring agency GCHQ in Cheltenham, in western England.
There he spent time “with those using cutting-edge technology, technical ingenuity and wide-ranging partnerships to identify, analyse and disrupt threats,” the palace added.
GCHQ’s head of counter-terrorism operations, whose name was given only as David, said the prince had worked “exceptionally hard to embed himself in the team”.
He added William had “comfortably held his own amongst some highly skilled analysts and operators”.
The prince is no stranger to the world of security.
After graduating in 2005 from university in St Andrews in Scotland, he spent seven and a half years in the military, before completing active service as a search and rescue helicopter pilot. "

ZURICH: Central bankers and finance ministers get another chance to take stock of the global economy, and risks from trade tensions to Brexit, when they gather in Washington this week.
The International Monetary Fund, which holds its spring meetings, will also update its global outlook.
The question is whether policy makers are still clinging to hopes of stabilisation, or if optimism has completely faded.
IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde has hinted at the latter, saying the world is in a “precarious” position.
“The IMF meetings take place against the backdrop of elevated uncertainty,” said Tom Orlik, chief economist at Bloomberg Economics. “Our global GDP tracker is flagging the weakest growth since the financial crisis.
The Fed pause, trade truce, and China stimulus, though, mean policy is now more supportive. We think the bottom for 2019 growth is either now or soon.”
In January, the IMF made particularly dramatic downgrades to euro-area forecasts. The situation looks even worse now, meaning there’s little for European Central Bank policy makers to cheer when they meet in Frankfurt on Wednesday.
The same day, the Federal Reserve publishes the minutes of its March meeting, a chance to glean more detail on why Chairman Jerome Powell put U.S. interest rates on a prolonged pause.
Here’s our weekly rundown of key economic events:
US
There’s been some signs of progress on US-China trade talks, and Friday’s jobs report was a case of normal service resuming after February’s disappointment. Next week sees the release of a US inflation measure along with the University of Michigan consumer confidence index. In addition to the Fed minutes, the central bank’s two vice chairmen – Richard Clarida and Randal Quarles – are due to speak, as is St. Louis Fed President James Bullard.
What Bloomberg’s Economists Say
“The main theme in the docket for the week following the March jobs report will be inflation. The jobs data are showing wage pressures intensifying relative to earlier in the current economic cycle.
Upcoming releases on inflation, including CPI, PPI, import prices and inflation expectations will help to provide context on the degree to which labor costs are finally passing through the production pipeline.” – Carl Riccadonna, chief U.S economist
Asia
Under the cloud of the US-China negotiations, Asia’s data such as South Korean jobs, Japanese machine tool orders and Taiwanese exports will be scrutinised for clues as to how regional economies are faring amid the uncertainty.
Chinese factory price figures on Thursday may show that mammoth sector is again flirting with deflation, while export numbers on Friday are expected to indicate a modest rebound after February’s holiday-related slump.
ECB
With the slowdown ongoing, ECB officials may hold off providing fresh details on their new loan program until they have more clarity. I
Investors will be focusing on any clues on what President Mario Draghi meant when he said policy makers should look at ways to soften the impact of negative rates.
In the UK, monthly GDP for February will help illustrate the state of the economy during the first quarter when companies were preparing for the threat of a no-deal Brexit – a danger which hasn’t yet gone away.
Purchasing manager indexes suggest heavy stockpiling by factories and a slump in sentiment in services.
Israel’s central bank is expected to keep its base rate at 0.2% when it meets on Monday, a day before the general election. Turkey watchers will be paying close attention to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s meeting with Vladimir Putin in Moscow on Monday, as the US ratchets up pressure on Turkey to back off from a purchase of Russian missiles or face economic sanctions.
Weekly Thursday data releases on capital flows in Turkey have suddenly gained importance amid massive dollar purchases by locals, outflows from foreign investors and a rapid draw-down in central bank reserves.
Americas
Brazil’s monthly inflation figures are due out on Wednesday, while in Mexico the central bank will release the minutes from its March meeting a day later.
The statement may offer clues as to whether an interest rate cut is in the offing. Peru is expected to keep its benchmark lending rate at an eight-year low when its central bank board meets Thursday evening. "

(File pic)
SUBANG JAYA: Following a long struggle and public protests, the national cricket governing body can finally breathe a sigh of relief as the Cabinet has given the green light for the Kinrara Oval to remain at its present site in Puchong near here.
At the Malaysian Cricket Association’s annual awards ceremony held at the oval last night, its president, V Mahinda, said it had not heard officially from the government yet although he felt it was a “done deal”.
“We will wait and see as the ministry said they will work on it,” he told FMT, adding that the association was ready to help the government in any way it could to develop the sport.
“We’ve come a long way,” Mahinda said on the sidelines of the event, its fourth since its inception, at the oval in Bandar Kinrara.
“I’m optimistic (about Kinrara Oval’s future).”
The Cabinet was recently reported to have agreed to allow Kinrara Oval to remain at its original site, following months of uncertainty after it had been slated for closure, rezoning and development.
Last year, the association said it had been given notice to vacate the oval, formerly a popular recreational ground for Kinrara residents, as its 15-year lease was approaching its end.
The landowner, Kinrara Housing Bhd (PKB), was reported to have plans to turn the decades-old ground into a shopping and condominium project.
PKB is a subsidiary of property development company I&P Group Sdn Bhd, which in turn is wholly-owned by SP Setia Bhd.
Permodalan Nasional Bhd (PNB), a government-linked investment company, has a 55.93% equity interest in SP Setia.
The earlier decision to take over Kinrara Oval sparked an outcry from players, supporters and cricket clubs nationwide as international games had been played there and it had sparked greater interest in cricket.
In February, after discussions between Youth and Sports Minister Syed Saddiq Syed Abdul Rahman and other parties, including PKB, a decision was taken to keep Kinrara Oval where it is.
Kinrara Oval has been lauded by the international cricket community for its upkeep and state-of-the-art facilities — one of only three in the country.

Flanking them are British High Commissioner Charles Hay and Malaysian Cricket Association president V Mahinda.
Since it opened in 2003, the oval — a stone’s throw from the BK5 LRT station — has hosted many international tournaments, such as the DLF Trophy, involving Australia, India and the West Indies, and the 2008 Under-19 Cricket World Cup.
The 5,000-capacity stadium also hosted the 2017 SEA Games, where cricket was a medal sport for the first time. Malaysia won a gold, a silver and a bronze in the three cricket events.
The Royal Malaysian Air Force (RMAF) teams also play there.
“Cricketers of all ages train here. Now, we also have women’s cricket teams,” Mahinda said.
He said a total of 148 matches had been played at Kinrara Oval over the last 36 months.
Another 56 will be held this year, not including state-organised friendlies and games.
He also said 850 schools nationwide currently have cricket teams.
More than 200 cricket enthusiasts and supporters attended last night’s event which, according to Mahinda, was evident of the love the cricket fraternity has for Kinrara Oval.
Present at the event were the president of the Olympic Council of Malaysia, Mohamad Norza Zakaria; the Indian and British high commissioners to Malaysia, Mridul Kumar and Charles Hay; and Brig-Gen Mohd Yunus Masjuki from the RMAF.
Present were Malaysian Cricket Association deputy president Arun Kumar, vice-president Nordin Abdullah and representatives from cricket clubs nationwide.

(Bloomberg pic)
SYDNEY: Australia will probably head to the polls on May 18 with Prime Minister Scott Morrison expected to wait another week to call a federal election, local media reported Sunday.
Morrison has chosen not to visit the governor-general in Canberra today, AAP reported, a move that effectively ruled out a May 11 election.
Sky News reported the government had opted against the earlier date due to a number of public holidays that could affect early voting. The opposition Labor party called that explanation “just absurd.”
“The only reason why this is occurring is so that they continue their roll-out of taxpayer-funded advertising,” Labor member of parliament Anthony Albanese told Sky News this morning.
Albanese said he estimated the ruling Liberal-National government was spending more than A$600,000 (US$426,000) a day on political advertising.
Treasurer Josh Frydenberg declined to say how much money the government was spending on political ads.
“Money is being spent in accordance with approved processes,” Frydenberg told ABC’s Insiders program Sunday. “That’s all transparent.”
The delay in calling a vote would allow coalition lawmakers to gauge support in the electorate for the federal budget, AAP said. Morrison’s government delivered its budget last week, pledging sweeping tax cuts mostly aimed at the middle class and a spending spree on transport infrastructure.
Polls show the Labor party, led by former union boss Bill Shorten, is poised to win power. Shorten, 51, has promised to implement reforms that would help eliminate generational inequality, skewed by a tax system that Labor claims has unfairly favoured baby boomers. "

NEW YORK: Two weeks ago, Google established an external panel of experts to review thorny ethical issues related to artificial intelligence.
It quickly imploded. After a staff revolt over the panel’s members, the company disbanded the panel on Thursday afternoon. Its members never even got the chance to meet.
The episode illustrates the difficulty Google is having as it grapples with the societal implications of the powerful technology shaping its future. It’s hard to overstate how important AI is to the company.
“It’s more profound than, I don’t know, electricity or fire,” said Sundar Pichai, the company’s chief executive officer, last year.
But Google has been at the centre of a widening public debate over how automated systems might disadvantage vulnerable groups or lead to large-scale job losses, and whether AI should be incorporated into weaponry.
The capability of Google’s panel – the Advanced Technology External Advisory Council, or ATEAC – to confront such issues was never entirely clear. But another group with a nearly identical name – the Advanced Technology Review Council – does hold real power to shape Google’s approach to its ethical quandaries.
The company describes this other council, which it assembled last year, as an attempt to “represent diverse, international, cross-functional points of view that can look beyond immediate commercial concerns,” according to documents viewed by Bloomberg News.
It has not publicly released the names of its members, but it includes some of the most influential people at the company, who have worked for years with Pichai and his boss, Google co-founder Larry Page, according to people familiar with the group.
This council is run by Kent Walker, Google’s chief legal officer. The other members are Urs Hölzle, Google’s infrastructure chief; Jeff Dean, head of AI; Jacquelline Fuller, vice president for Google.org; Maggie Johnson, vice president of education and university programs; and Mustafa Suleyman, co-founder of DeepMind, a leading AI research firm owned by Google parent Alphabet Inc.
Critics familiar with the council see it as a whitewash. They say a board of top executives is unlikely to serve as a serious check on Google in situations where its stated ethical principles butt up against its financial interests.
And multiple people inside the company said the agenda and decisions of this corporate board remain unclear months after launching. These people asked not to be identified for fear of retaliation.
When asked for comment, a Google spokesman pointed to a blog post in December that first introduced the group, highlighting the company’s progress in implementing its ethical principles on AI.
At that time, the company had conducted 100 reviews. In the blog post, Walker noted that the company had decided to hold off on a general-use facial recognition tool “before working through important technology and policy questions.”
Many technology companies have recently laid out ethical principles to guide their work on AI. Microsoft, Facebook and Axon, which makes stun guns and body cameras for police departments, all now have advisory boards on the issue.
But experts question whether these actions are designed primarily to head off new government regulations.
“Ethical codes may deflect criticism by acknowledging that problems exist, without ceding any power to regulate or transform the way technology is developed and applied,” wrote the AI Now Institute, a research group at New York University, in a 2018 report.
“We have not seen strong oversight and accountability to backstop these ethical commitments.”
AI Now’s report noted that Google had pursued a censored version of its search engine for the Chinese market, even after it had released a set of principles that seemed to preclude such a project on human rights grounds.
Google’s AI strategy first ran into serious ethical concerns last year, when revelations about its work on a drone initiative called Project Maven led to staff protests and work stoppages.
Last June, it released a set of ethical AI principles and created multiple committees to vote on whether proposed products meet the criteria.
These groups are similar to the way Google reviews services, like advertising and mobile software, for privacy guidelines and legal liability.
For AI, there’s a “Responsible Innovation team,” led by 12-year Google veteran Jen Gennai, which handles “day-to-day operations” and refers issues to an overarching board, according to the December company blog post.
Another larger group of advisers, comprised of less senior staff, is on call for in-house expertise on technical products and protocols.
Those two sit below the highest review board, the Advanced Technology Review Council, which will “help resolve complex issues surfaced by [Google’s] review process,” the internal document said.
The short life of the external council was a case study in the company’s vitriolic internal politics.
Within hours of its formation, outrage quickly built among staff members who objected to Google’s inclusion of Kay Coles James, president of the Heritage Foundation, and her prior public comments about gay and transgender people and climate change.
A petition calling for her removal began circulating. One member of the board resigned, while another defended the decision to stay. Right-wing news outlets published leaked messages from employees criticising James.
Breitbart News described messages harshly criticising James as “outright smears.” The Heritage Foundation did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday.
Joanna Bryson, a computer science professor at the University of Bath who was invited to Google’s external board, described its collapse as a major setback. “The bottom line is that we are back at the status quo, which personally I think is unacceptable,” she wrote in an email.
Google seems no closer to coming up with an approach that will satisfy anyone. On Thursday, when the company shuttered its external council, a company statement said it was “going back to the drawing board.” It made no mention of the internal panel. "
"We’ll give clearer explanation on Rome Statute issue, says Marzuki",www.freemalaysiatoday.com,Robin Augustin,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2019/04/07/well-give-clearer-explanation-on-rome-statute-issue-says-marzuki/,"We’ll give clearer explanation on Rome Statute issue, says Marzuki By April 7, 2019 1:08 PM Deputy Foreign Minister Marzuki Yahya.
KUALA LUMPUR: Putrajaya will provide a clearer explanation on its decision to withdraw from the Rome Statute in the near future, says Deputy Foreign Minister Marzuki Yahya.
Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of an event here today, Marzuki said he will discuss the matter with Foreign Minister Saifuddin Abdullah.
On whether Malaysia has officially informed the International Criminal Court (ICC) on its intention to withdraw, Marzuki said he was not sure.
As for the alleged possibility of the Rome Statute issue being manipulated to the extent that people would go to the streets, as claimed by Saifuddin, Marzuki said the minister would be better informed on the matter.
“Tun (Dr Mahathir Mohamad) has already made a statement on this and I think what Saifuddin said is related to what really happened,” he said after launching a book titled “Mahathir Kami Bersamamu” at the Putra World Trade Centre.
Saifuddin was reported as saying that the Cabinet’s decision to withdraw the ratification was a “political” move, done out of fear of a coup d’etat bid, spurred on by powers behind the scenes.
Marzuki, who is PPBM secretary-general, also said there was no issue with Warisan’s absence from the launch of Sabah PPBM in Kota Kinabalu yesterday.
“It was not a no-show. Shafie Apdal (Warisan president and Sabah chief minister) met Dr Mahathir at the airport.
“I am also made to understand that all Warisan divisions had their annual general meetings on the party polls, so they were all busy.”
He added that PPBM’s presence in Sabah would only serve to strengthen Pakatan Harapan.
On the South China Sea dispute, Marzuki said Malaysia was still at the negotiating stage with all other countries involved.
Previously, Mahathir had called on China to define the areas of the disputed South China Sea that it claimed to own in view of the importance of freedom of navigation in its busy waters. "

(AFP pic)
HUDDERSFIELD: Striker Jamie Vardy scored twice to help Leicester City to a commanding 4-1 victory over relegated Huddersfield Town in the Premier League on Saturday.
It was a fourth win in a row for manager Premier League Brandon Rogers took charge of Leicester in February as Huddersfield missed the chance to move off the bottom of the standings for the first time since December.
“We got off to a good start, getting the first goal of the game again, which is important,” Rodgers told reporters.
“We had other opportunities to be more convincing in the first half on the breakaway but didn’t quite finish them and the keeper made a couple of good saves.”
Leicester’s Youri Tielemans opened the scoring with a long-range strike following a corner in the 24th minute.
Vardy doubled the lead three minutes after the break when he got on the end of a sublime cross from right back Ricardo Pereira.
Huddersfield halved the lead four minutes later when midfielder Aaron Mooy converted a penalty after Caglar Soyuncu brought down Karlan Grant.
James Maddison restored Leicester’s two-goal advantage with a free kick in the 79th minute. Goalkeeper Ben Hamer misjudged the trajectory and took a step to his right before realising too late that the shot was headed to his left.
“When they scored the third our heads dropped and it’s difficult,” Mooy told BBC. “We’ve had such a tough season and it’s just another day when we were not good enough. It’s been a really hard week emotionally.”
Vardy sealed victory with a penalty when Terence Kongolo fouled him after he had rounded the goalkeeper.
It was his 104th goal for Leicester, going past former England striker Gary Lineker’s haul for the club, and his 15th league goal of the season.
“I can take positives, we don’t like the result at all,” Huddersfield manager Jan Siewert said. “At halftime we were down 1-0 and we changed it and came out and tried everything… and they scored too easily.”
The result lifted Leicester to seventh in the standings with 47 points from 33 games, ahead of Wolverhampton Wanderers on goal difference. "

Singapore’s ‘fake news’ laws upset tech giants,www.freemalaysiatoday.com,AFP,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/world/2019/04/07/singapores-fake-news-laws-upset-tech-giants/,"Singapore’s ‘fake news’ laws upset tech giants By April 7, 2019 12:16 PM Singapore skyline, September 12, 2018. (Reuters pic)
SINGAPORE: Tech giants have reacted with horror after Singapore proposed laws against “fake news” allowing authorities to order the removal of content and impose hefty fines, in what critics say is an assault on free speech.
The government unveiled a bill last week containing tough measures, including powers for ministers to order social media sites like Facebook to put warnings next to posts authorities believe to be false and in extreme cases take them down.
If an action is deemed malicious and damaging to Singapore’s interests, companies could be hit with fines of up to Sg$1 million (US$740,000). Individuals could face jail terms of up to 10 years.
Authorities in the tightly-controlled country – long criticised for restricting civil liberties – insist the measures are necessary to stop the circulation of falsehoods which could sow divisions in the multi-ethnic city-state.
But press freedom groups condemned the proposals, saying they could stifle online discussion, as did tech companies which have big investments in the ultra-modern city.
“As the most far-reaching legislation of its kind to date, this level of overreach poses significant risks to freedom of expression and speech,” said the Asia Internet Coalition, an industry association whose members include Facebook, Google and Twitter.
Simon Milner, Facebook’s vice president of public policy in Asia-Pacific, said the social media giant was concerned about potentially being compelled to remove content.
“Giving people a place to express themselves freely and safely is important to us and we have a responsibility to handle any government request to remove alleged misinformation carefully and thoughtfully,” he said in a statement.
The internet is a relatively free space in Singapore and there are some local alternative news sites, which are typically more critical of the authorities than the traditional, pro-government newspapers and TV.
Singapore is among several countries pushing legislation to fight fake news, and the government stressed ordering “corrections” to be placed alongside falsehoods would be the primary response, rather than jail or fines.
A government decision can also be appealed to the courts.
‘Courts will decide’
K. Shanmugam, law and home affairs minister, said in a Facebook post that “the proposed law targets false statements of fact – not opinions, not criticisms.
“Ultimately, disagreement over truth and falsity will be decided by the courts”.
Google, Facebook and Twitter have their Asia headquarters in Singapore, a city of 5.6 million which is popular with expats as it is developed, safe and efficient.
But there were already signs of tensions with tech companies as the government prepared to unveil the laws. During parliamentary hearings last year about tackling online falsehoods, Google and Facebook urged the government not to introduce new laws.
In November, Facebook refused a request to remove an article linking Singapore to a financial scandal in Malaysia which the government said was untrue – prompting the law ministry to say the firm “cannot be relied upon to filter falsehoods”.
Critics say one of the most worrying aspects of the new legislation is that it is up to authorities to decide what is false and what is not.
While authorities insist decisions can be appealed, Kirsten Han, the Singapore-based editor of regional news site New Naratif, said most people do not have the resources or will to fight the government.
“Even if you are convinced that your Facebook post is in the right, how many average Singaporeans would appeal to the minister, and then spend thousands of dollars to hire a lawyer and file an application in the court?” she told AFP.
Human Rights Watch has described the bill as “sweepingly broad” while critics note Singapore already has tough laws against sedition, defamation and disturbing racial harmony, that can be used to police the web.
But it is not yet clear how the legislation – which is likely to pass easily through the ruling party-dominated parliament – will be used in practice, and some believe authorities will wield it cautiously.
“I think that the government will be very careful in their implementation of the law,” said Professor Ang Peng Hwa, from the Wee Kim Wee School of Communication and Information in Singapore.
“I think, in general, there’s a very high level of trust in the government and its institutions by foreign entities, and so I don’t see them… being too trigger-happy about the implementation of this bill.” "
Japanese prosecutors ask judges to question Ghosn’s wife,www.freemalaysiatoday.com,Reuters,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/business/2019/04/07/japanese-prosecutors-ask-judges-to-question-ghosns-wife/,"Japanese prosecutors ask judges to question Ghosn’s wife By April 7, 2019 11:48 AM Carlos Ghosn and wife Carole Ghosn. (AFP pic)
TOKYO: Prosecutors in Tokyo have asked judges to question Carlos Ghosn’s wife in connection with funds allegedly misappropriated by the former Nissan Motor chairman, Japan’s public broadcaster NHK said on Sunday.
Prosecutors arrested Ghosn again on Thursday on suspicion he had tried to enrich himself at the Nissan’s expense, in another dramatic twist that his lawyers said was an attempt to muzzle him.
NHK said prosecutors suspect that Ghosn siphoned off part of the payments through a company where his wife, Carole Ghosn, is an executive to purchase a yacht and a boat.
The prosecutors asked her to meet them for voluntary questioning as an unsworn witness, but the request was turned down, which prompted them to ask judges to question her on their behalf before they open the first hearing on the allegations, the broadcaster said.
Such a request gives judges the power to question on a mandatory basis witnesses who refuse to testify, according to NHK.
Prosecutors were not immediately available for comment on the NHK report.
Ghosn’s lead lawyer, Junichiro Hironaka, said on Thursday prosecutors confiscated Ghosn’s mobile phone, documents, notebooks and diaries, along with his wife’s passport and mobile phone.
Under Japanese law, prosecutors will be able to hold Ghosn for up to 22 days without charge.
The fresh arrest opens up the possibility that he will be interrogated again without his lawyer present, as is the norm inJapan.
The additional charge would likely prolong Ghosn’s trial, which is expected to begin later this year, his lawyer has said, adding that loss of access to Ghosn’s trial-related documents could put his client at a disadvantage in fighting his case.
Meanwhile, Carole has flown to Paris to appeal to the French government to help her husband and said the government “should do more for him”, the Financial Times reported on Sunday.
“I think the French government should do more for him. I don’t think they’ve done enough. I don’t think he’s had enough support and he’s calling for assistance. As a French citizen, it should be a right”, she told the FT https://on.ft.com/2UCBXvq in an interview before boarding her flight out of Japan late on Friday. "

(AFP pic)
RALEIGH: Former world number one Caroline Wozniacki maintained her dominance over Croatia’s Petra Martic on Saturday to move into the final of the Charleston Open where she will play Madison Keys.
Dane Wozniacki, showing confidence after a recent illness, defeated Martic 6-3 6-4 before American Keysturned back Monica Puig 6-4 6-0 in a semi-final that was delayed for more than an hour by rain.
“I’m just so thrilled to be healthy, that’s the main thing,” the fifth-seeded Wozniacki said after making her first final of the year.
“It’s been a long time since I made this long run here,” said the Dane who won the South Carolina tournament in 2011.
The fifth seed broke Martic twice in the second set to claim the win and maintain her record of never having lost a set to Martic in six meetings.
“I served well in most of the match and I think I returned really well most of the match as well, and I just tried to stay aggressive as much as I could and tried to make (Martic) run and make her move,” Wozniacki said.
Wozniacki, world number 13, grabbed a 4-2 lead in the second set but the 16th-seeded Martic bounced back to level at 4-4 before the Dane broke back and closed out the match.
“I thought I was close,” said Martic. “But many players feel this way against Caroline. I felt like I couldn’t keep up with her physically.”
Keys led 4-3 in the first set when rain halted her match with Puerto Rico’s Puig.
The big-hitting American, who upset top seed Sloane Stephens in the quarter-finals, lost only one more game, winning eight in a row to seal victory.
Keys closed out the first set with a forehand service return, then broke Puig, the Olympic champion, three times in the decider.
Puig did not go quickly in the final game, though, saving three match points before Keys hit a big forehand return on a fourth match point to force an error from Puig.
The rain delay helped Keys.
“Honestly it was good,” she said. “I had just gotten broken and I got to go inside a reset. I think I did a pretty good job to close it out.”
Keys, who has lost to Wozniacki twice, said meeting the Dane on clay could work in her favour.
“It’s a little bit of a slower court,” Keys said. “My heavy ball will work better so I think I will be able to do a little more.” "

(Bernama pic)
PETALING JAYA: Dr Mahathir Mohamad said his one-time nemesis turned ally Anwar Ibrahim makes for a better leader compared to Najib Razak despite his past reservations about the PKR president.
In an exclusive interview with New Straits Times, Mahathir said it was more acceptable for Anwar to replace “a person like Najib” than to allow the former prime minister to continue administering the country.
This is why he chose to work with Anwar despite what they have said about each other in the past, the prime minister said.
“Between Najib and Anwar, I think Najib is a worse leader than Anwar.
“I thought that our working together was far more important, in order to displace Najib, than for us to quarrel because I knew if we didn’t work together, Najib would be the next prime minister and that would be disastrous for the country,” the English daily quoted him as saying.
He was asked to respond to the times he said Anwar – who is poised to succeed him – was not fit to be a leader.
Mahathir and Anwar have had an acrimonious relationship over two decades sparked when Mahathir, during his first stint as prime minister, sacked Anwar as his deputy in 1998.
A year later, Anwar – who was at one time Mahathir’s protege – was convicted of corruption and sodomy.
However, they buried the hatchet in 2016 and worked together to bring down the Barisan Nasional in the May 9 polls.
Asked if Anwar is able to keep Pakatan Harapan together, Mahathir said Anwar has been leading a considerable part of the ruling coalition.
“In fact, he was the architect of Pakatan Rakyat. Of course, Pakatan Rakyat failed because they were not that cohesive. But after we came together, we were able to work much more closely.” "

"Interesting spots in Upper Burma, Mandalay Malaysia Today",www.freemalaysiatoday.com,,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/leisure/2019/03/29/interesting-spots-in-upper-burma-mandalay/,"Interesting spots in Upper Burma, Mandalay By - March 29, 2019 8:30 AM
Myanmar has been in the news for all the wrong reasons. But a lot has happened since 2010.
At that time Nobel Peace Prize Winner Aung San Suu Kyi was still under house arrest, receiving the world’s sympathy and adulation for her brave and determined opposition to Burma’s military rulers.
Now she is Myanmar’s de facto leader and is under fire for not speaking up against the forced expulsion of the Muslim Rohingya community, which the United Nations and many others regard as ethnic cleansing but which the Burmese see as sending foreigners back to where they came from.
Whatever the circumstances, there is no excuse for the inhumane treatment of innocent people, especially women and children.
There are probably days when Aung San Suu Kyi wishes she was back in her cosy Yangon bungalow under house arrest.
This trip is to the Mandalay area in what is sometimes called Upper Burma in particular Pyin Oo Lwin, formerly the British hill station of Maymyo, named after a Colonel May.
A sister site to Thrifty Traveller contains five articles about this area, which you can read by following these links:"

From the TV series “Modern Warfare.”
( The first War I fought in on a Dabur class patrol boat off Sidon, Tyre and Beirut. – JW )
The 1982 Lebanon War, dubbed Operation Peace for Galilee (Hebrew: מבצע שלום הגליל, or מבצע של”ג‎ Mivtsa Shlom HaGalil or Mivtsa Sheleg) by the Israeli government, later known in Israel as the Lebanon War or the First Lebanon War (Hebrew: מלחמת לבנון הראשונה‎, Milhemet Levanon Harishona), and known in Lebanon as “the invasion” (Arabic: الاجتياح‎, Al-ijtiyāḥ), began on 6 June 1982, when the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) invaded southern Lebanon, after repeated attacks and counter-attacks between the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) operating in southern Lebanon and the IDF that had caused civilian casualties on both sides of the border.[16][17][18] The military operation was launched after gunmen from Abu Nidal’s organization attempted to assassinate Shlomo Argov, Israel’s ambassador to the United Kingdom. Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin blamed Abu Nidal’s enemy, the PLO, for the incident,[19][20] and treated the incident as a casus belli for the invasion.[21][22][i]
After attacking the PLO – as well as Syrian, leftist, and Muslim Lebanese forces – the Israeli military, in cooperation with the Maronite allies and the self-proclaimed Free Lebanon State, occupied southern Lebanon, eventually surrounding the PLO and elements of the Syrian Army. Surrounded in West Beirut and subjected to heavy bombardment, the PLO forces and their allies negotiated passage from Lebanon with the aid of United States Special Envoy Philip Habib and the protection of international peacekeepers. The PLO, under the chairmanship of Yasser Arafat, had relocated its headquarters to Tripoli in June 1982. Share this:"
"Trump’s blacklisting of Iran’s Guards bodes tougher US oil sanctions, more IDF air strikes in W. Iraq as well as Syria – DEBKAfile",warsclerotic.com,josephwouk,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://warsclerotic.com/2019/04/07/trumps-blacklisting-of-irans-guards-bodes-tougher-us-oil-sanctions-more-idf-air-strikes-in-w-iraq-as-well-as-syria-debkafile/,"Israeli attacks on Iran in Iraq , US brands IRGC terrorists , US sanctions Iran
President Donald Trump’s planned designation of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) as a terrorist organization on Monday, April 8 , will add to US steps for maximizing the economic pressure on Iran in the coming two months.
It is the first time a government military entity has been branded terrorist. The US can expect Iran to retaliate at once by proclaiming the American army a global terrorist organization on a par with the Islamic State and calling on allied regimes to follow Tehran’s example, such as, for instance, Nicolas Maduro in Venezuela.
Closer to home, Syrian President Bashar Assad, Hizballah’s leader Hassan Nasrallah and the pro-Iranian militia conglomerate in Iraq, may well act in solidarity with Iran, in which case, violent clashes may erupt between the proxies Iran has scattered across the Middle East and US forces. Conscious of the threat, on Friday, April 5, American army units in the region were placed on the alert for Iranian-orchestrated reprisals.
DEBKAfile’s military analysts suggests that Trump’s latest move against the IRGC may take practical form in various ways: Does it mean that that US forces are henceforth licensed to attack IRGC forces in their different regional sectors of operation? Or was it a general directive to open the door for such attacks in the future? More realistically, blacklisting the IRGC as a terrorist organization is likely to bear more significantly on the Corps economic power, rather than its military functions. The Guards are not only Iran’s most powerful security organization, with control over its missiles and nuclear programs; they also rule essential sections of the economy, with responsibility for the country’s oil exports and import of energy products. The IRGC, moreover, manages the mechanisms set up with foreign governments, such as China, Russia, Turkey, Iraq and some western Europeans, to bypass or blunt the existing US sanctions against Iran. Therefore, Trump’s next action against the IRGC is likely to be the tightening of oil sanctions, which is expected to be announced on May 8, to mark the first anniversary of his decision to take the US out of the 2015 nuclear accord with Iran. Those sanctions will be made more painful by Washington recalling the waivers granted to a number of nations, such as India, China and Iraq, allowing them to purchase certain quantities of Iranian oil while it was under embargo. Three weeks ago, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told an energy conference in Houston that the purpose of the administration’s sanctions against Iran was to “drive Iran’s oil exports down to zero.” Israel will be empowered to step up its aerial assaults on Iranian forces in Syria and extend them to western Iraq, where pro-Iranian Iraqi Shiite militias have piled up under IRGC command."

A blow-up doll of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wearing a crown has been placed in Tel Aviv's Habima Square by student protesters from the southern city of Sderot, just days before elections.The students, who have been protesting for days about the security situation in the South and the continued rocket fire from Gaza, placed the doll on the floor in the square so that people can say a ""final goodbye"" to him before the election on Tuesday. They also jokingly put a charity box next to it to pay for his ""legal representation"" as he faces legal troubles.The two students, who erected the life-sized Bibi doll and are studying animation at Sapir College, told Channel 12 News that they put it there to allow the public to have a final chance to ""say goodbye"" to the prime minister and ""give him a hug"" as elections draw closer. ""He introduces himself as Mr. Security,"" students Yael Solomonovich and Paz Bernstein told Channel 12. ""[But] just like you have a [teddy]bear when you're a little child [to make you feel safe], [and] it doesn't really help you, he [Netanyahu]... introduces himself as the only thing that will protect us at night.""The cities residents, including opposition supporters, stopped by the doll while walking past to take selfies with it and find out more about what it was doing there.
