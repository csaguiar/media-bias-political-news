There are reasons why TV shows aren't full of chubsters being the leads of romantic comedies etc - believablity and escapism. People don't want to leave the stress of their own life, just to be reminded of the grim realities of overweight people turning red faced and sweating by simply walking up the stairs.
Not to mention the sane majority few being fat/chubby/obese as being unhealthy and generally undesirable - which is true and just a fact of scientific opinion.
If the alien really wants to find out that chubby people have sex too, I'm sure there are other ways of finding out other than watching BBC at 9pm on a Saturday evening."

It already looks like the big guns of the European Union are doing everything they can to frustrate a democratic outcome in the United Kingdom. Donald Tusk's offer of a 12 month extension is clearly not intended to help Britain determine the terms on which it leaves. It has quite a different purpose. It is intended to give remainers a get out of jail free card. The intention is to present prevarication as some sort of constitutional crisis which can only be resolved by a second referendum.
All those people who voted leave but with considerable reservations about the EU's ability to democratize itself are seeing all their worst fears realised. Tusk represents the typical technocratic top-down approach to problems which rejects the bottom-up Democratic approach where people decide the answers to the problems, not some unaccountable distant EU apparatchik.
All the worst features of the EU have been on display in the past few weeks."

That, and not irritants such as awarding child benefit to children who were not born and do not reside in the UK, which the then PM also tried to negotiate about, is the chief obstacle to our remaining in the EU so long as the British believe in local democratic accountability.
Perhaps an unchecked capitalism is good for the planet. Perhaps globalists can be trusted both to create the framework inside which we act, and to micromanage our lives. Perhaps we should accept that our lives are to be conducted for us by Those Who Know Best, & felt it unnecessary to tell us what their intentions were, in case we resisted. But then again....
A reformed EU, which allowed the collaborating nations to retain their national identities ( in the interests of valuing diversity). and restrained its injunctions to core projects absolutely requiring cooperation, is one I would have wanted to belong to. Even the creation of an EU army could have been discussed. But as it is, I understood the Leave vote. And it wasn't in every case because people had nostalgia for Empire. That's a fabrication designed to express contempt.
I like the Rojava model, or the Swiss, with its cooperative cantons. Once the Tories are gone, perhaps something more sustainable and creative can emerge. No-Deal is the best bet for now. Let's finalise the leaving process, take a deep breath, and see what can be built from that point on."

I only hope that the EU takes the long view of this. If they cut the quick deal that the likes of Rees Mogg want, they may well get Boris as PM and the future relationship looks bleak.

Surely the normal ""advice column"" response would go something like this.
""Any lasting partnership needs to be a partnership of equals, with both sides showing each other respect and consideration for the other's needs and feelings. If you feel you are not getting that in your relationship, you have a problem that needs fixing: allowing yourself to be bullied indefinitely is to submit to a form of abuse.
Your first step is to sit your partner down and calmly explain how things seem from your point of view. Listen to your partner explain their their own perspective. Explain the kind of change you need to see, and why you think it is needed. Listen to your partner's response, and try to reach a mutually agreeable accommodation. Then wait to see if what has been agreed is actually carried out - and give your partner the opportunity to correct backsliding.
When you've done all this, and lost all hope that your partner is willing or capable of adjusting their behaviour, and if their behaviour remains intolerable to you, then you need to dissolve the relationship. Try to walk away as friends, but remember that breakups often cause bitterness. Do not be too shocked by the initial reaction, or disheartened by it: once your partner gets over the sting of rejection, there will still be the opportunity to build some kind of future relationship - but this can only really start once you have left.""

San Demetrio ne’ Vestini, a village about 13km away welcomed its own illustrious visitor when George Clooney flew in from his Lake Como home to inaugurate the construction of a new theatre to replace one destroyed in nearby Casentino earlier that year.
The Hollywood actor’s support helped to boost donations, and the restoration of the theatre has become one of the few sources of civic pride in an area that is still a long way from a full recovery.
Graphic “He probably doesn’t realise just how much his support has contributed to this small miracle,” said Giancarlo Gentilucci, who runs the theatre, called Spazio Nobelperlapace, with his wife, Tiziana Irti.
The 6.3-magnitude earthquake that struck the central region of Abruzzo on 6 April 2009 killed 309 people, left 70,000 homeless and devastated around 56 villages in Italy’s mountainous heart.
Some of the G8 leaders fulfilled their promises to donate funds to the reconstruction, but the theatre, which hosts shows, concerts and other events throughout the year, has played a pivotal role in helping rebuild the tattered social fabric.
“It’s become a necessity for people who use it,” said Irti. “They say it’s their safety anchor, their point of reference. Many came out of their isolation; for others it’s been a way to express themselves. Many friendships have been formed, and across the generations.”
As L’Aquila marks the 10th anniversary of the earthquake, the bells of Santa Maria del Suffragio church in the city’s historic centre chimed 309 times at 3.32am on Saturday – the time the tremor hit a decade ago – to remember the dead. In his homily, Archbishop Giuseppe Petrocchi stressed that the most important thing to restore was “the community and its citizens”. He added: “This must march in parallel with the construction of buildings.”

A torchlight procession, attended by prime minister Giuseppe Conte, was held to recall those who died in L’Aquila but also the 297 killed in an earthquake in nearby Amatrice in 2016 and others across the country over the past two decades.
“We have a duty not to forget, but above all we have a duty to be constantly striving to relaunch this territory,” said Conte.
Today, the historic centre of L’Aquila, which was home to around 20,000 people before the earthquake, is a tale of two cities: one still emerging from the rubble, the other resiliently trying to return to normal. The few inhabitants who have gone back to their homes over the past couple of years live beside cranes, diggers and dusty roads. Meticulously restructured buildings stand opposite ones still clad in scaffolding. By day, workmen help by patronising the handful of bars, restaurants and shops that have reopened. By night, those businesses are kept afloat by students from L’Aquila’s university.
“Even though we’re surrounded by scaffolding, building sites and very few people, when you open the door to your house and you’re inside, you feel at home, and that’s enough,” said Paola Inverardi, the university’s rector. A thriving university town before the disaster, L’Aquila lost 55 students in the quake. Eight perished when their hall of residence collapsed. The others had been living in modern, but structurally weak, buildings just outside the walled medieval city.

It is difficult to find out how many people are now living in the centre, with some guessing “a few hundred” and others “around 1,000”. Inverardi, who was dean of the science faculty at the time of the earthquake, moved back into her home last year. In the months after the tragedy she lived in a tent in her sister’s garden before moving to one of 19 “new towns” rapidly built across the area. She stayed there for less than two years before moving into a repaired building on the outskirts of the city.
To say that rebuilding has been slow would be an understatement. Work in the historic centre only began to gather pace in 2013 after problems with mismanagement, political wrangling, stifling bureaucracy and corruption and probes into contractors’ links with the mafia. Then there was the exploitation: the earthquake was disastrous for the people of L’Aquila but a golden opportunity for the construction sector. Even before the dead had been named, two high-profile entrepreneurs, Pierfrancesco Gagliardi and his brother-in-law, Francesco Piscicelli, were overheard in a wiretapped phone call bragging about contracts the disaster could bring their way.
“It was a huge business,” said Angelo Imperiale, who grew up in L’Aquila and is now a PhD student at Groningen University in the Netherlands. Imperiale has written a thesis on the emergency response to the earthquake and the impact it had on survivors and the environment. “As the area became heavily militarised, pushing people away from their homes and preventing them from even accessing their belongings, the red zones became a huge cake divided among influential building entrepreneurs, both local and national.”
Some 2,000 families still live in prefab housing scattered across the mountains, and another 3,000 are in the new towns. Former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi’s anti-seismic housing initiative was originally hailed an “Italian miracle”, but over time the buildings’ defects started to show, with former L’Aquila mayor Massimo Cialente suggesting it would be better to demolish the projects due to the structural weaknesses and high maintenance costs.
The haphazard emergency response also damaged social connections: those not housed locally were put up in hotels along the Adriatic coast for almost two years. Berlusconi said at the time that it would be “a nice break” for them.
“There was no systematic approach to engaging people,” added Imperiale. “And today there are many still living in temporary, unsafe housing, who just want to get back to normal life.”
But those seeking to restore a sense of normality have been irritated by the heavy focus on L’Aquila’s problems in some of the media’s anniversary coverage. “They spoke about us in a way that pushed us back 10 years,” said Inverardi. “OK, there is still a lot to do, but over the past decade, we as a community have been trying to exist, to imagine our future and work towards that.”

Island Song by Madeleine Bunting review – wartime family secrets | Books | The Guardian,www.theguardian.com,Anthony Quinn,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/apr/07/island-song-by-madeleine-bunting-review,"Exploring the moral complexities of occupation. T he past is a foreign, and nearly forgotten, country in Madeleine Bunting’s Island Song , a striking first novel that explores the moral complexities of occupation during the second world war. Its focus is Guernsey, “a miniature English county surrounded by the Atlantic”, once a throwback to an earlier, more genteel age, later the victim of a “model occupation” when the Germans invaded in 1940 and subjugated its natives for five years.
Bunting has designed the novel as a double narrative, alternating deftly between the mid-1990s and the war years, allowing the reader a privileged glimpse into secret alliances and compromises whose meanings only emerge by degrees. Divorced London lawyer Roz has been mourning the death of her beautiful, emotionally distant mother, Helene, when she receives via her solicitor a letter that shivers the family timbers. In it, her late, beloved father, Justin, confesses that she wasn’t his daughter at all; Helene, his wife since 1949, had been previously married as a young woman in Guernsey. It seems that Justin’s professional calamities as an art dealer in the 1960s can be traced back to a desperate compact Helene made during the war.
These tantalising hints of a hitherto unknown life throw Roz for a loop. Old photographs and diaries of life during wartime perplex her. She decides to turn sleuth – under the disapproving glare of one brother and the pale encouragement of another – and sets out for Guernsey in search of her mother’s past. “Could she ennoble it and call it the truth?” Her investigation takes her from gossiping locals who recall the occupation to afternoons of hard slog in the library, where she meets Antoine, a dashing young historian from Paris who’s hunting a missing cache of artworks, including a valuable oil by Cranach. These were probably stolen by the Nazis during their brutal rampage through Europe. Antoine’s research is not merely academic – he wants justice for the Jewish family whose property was looted and, by extension, a reckoning for all those implicated in such crimes. But where does Roz’s mother stand on that spectrum?
Bunting’s portrait of Helene – her struggle with loneliness, her feelings of abandonment – is interestingly ambiguous
Bunting’s detailed, authoritative picture of Guernsey under the jackboot derives from her acclaimed The Model Occupation , a history of the Channel Islands in 1940-45. We get a strong sense of the fearful, half-starved population, abandoned and cut off from the motherland, while their occupiers lord it in relative comfort, enjoying whatever decent food and supplies get through from France. Dark rumours of a slave labour camp emerge from nearby Sark and, as the war turns against the Reich, the deportations to Germany spread terror across the island.
Bunting organises her mosaic of clues in a careful, unshowy prose that only occasionally plods. A character with “a mind as sharp as a razor” requires the cut of a steely editor. She has a habit of presenting sophisticated arguments – about national identity, for instance – within long screeds of dialogue and doesn’t always hear the staginess of it. The book could do with some trimming, particularly in the last hundred pages when Roz’s toing and froing propels her, rather slowly, towards revelation.
And yet Island Song carries a strong tune. Bunting’s imaginative portrait of the young Helene – her struggle with loneliness, her feelings of abandonment – is interestingly ambiguous and moving. In her friendship with a fugitive Russian prisoner and a charming, disaffected German officer, we begin to understand the fateful compromises people make during periods of terrible stress and danger and the likely consequences that ensue when the fog of war starts to clear.
As Antoine wisely puts it: “Self-righteousness is deeply satisfying – and cheap. How many of us can be sure that we wouldn’t have tried to find a way to manage in the war?” The irresolvable mystery of this story, in common with all great fiction, is the human heart.

Concerns rise over safety of vulnerable immigration centre detainees | UK news,www.theguardian.com,Mark Townsend,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/apr/07/immigration-centre-detainees-safety-concerns-hospitalised,"Sick and distressed inmates are being admitted to hospital at the rate of almost one a day, Home Office data shows. Detainees at UK immigration centres are being hospitalised at the rate of almost one a day, according to new figures that raise fresh concerns over the safety of vulnerable people held inside.
Home Office data, obtained following a freedom of information request, revealed that in 2017, there were 330 visits to hospital by detainees held in immigration removal centres.
The figures were recorded between January and December 2017, shortly after the Home Office introduced its “ adults at risk policy ”, which was meant to keep vulnerable people out of detention.
The findings follow a scathing report last month by the home affairs select committee that said the Home Office had overseen serious failings in almost every aspect of the immigration detention process.
Sonya Sceats, chief executive of charity Freedom from Torture , which submitted the FoI request, said: “The Home Office figures make it abundantly clear that there are very ill and vulnerable people in these immigration detention centres.
“It is shocking to think that almost every day of the month, there is a hospital admission. From removal centre reports to accounts from torture survivors in treatment with us, we know that self-harm, overdoses and poor provision of medication are commonplace.”
Sceats outlined one case involving a distressed detainee who made 22 calls on the emergency bell in his cell before staff came to see him and called an ambulance.
“Torture survivors and vulnerable people should never be detained for immigration purposes,” she added.
Another parliamentary report published in February , this time by the joint committee on human rights (JCHR), called for an end to indefinite detention in immigration centres, and said people should ideally be held for no longer than 28 days.
A Home Office spokesperson said: “The health and welfare of those in immigration detention is of the utmost importance. All immigration detention centres have trained medical staff on hand to provide care to those in detention.”

"The verdict on India’s strongman, Narendra Modi | World news",www.theguardian.com,Michael Safi,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/07/narendra-modi-bjp-leader-election-trail,"Religious conflicts, caste antagonism, economic fears: India’s 900 million voters present a formidable challenge to the country’s leader as he battles for re-election. Michael Safi and Kakoli Bhattacharya test the mood of a restless population in the key state of Uttar Pradesh. S pend enough time discussing Indian politics this year and you will inevitably find yourself contemplating the chest proportions of a 68-year-old man. In Agra, the north Indian city famous for the Taj Mahal, it only took a few minutes.
“He has a 56-inch chest,” Harsh Bhagal said when asked why he supports India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi . It is a boast the Indian leader first made on the campaign trail in 2014. His opponents laughed, but five years later, 23-year-old Bhagal is preparing to cast his first vote for the Bharatiya Janata Janata party (BJP), inspired by its strongman leader.
“When Pakistan attacked us in Kashmir [in February],” he said – pausing momentarily to take a selfie of our interview – “Modi waited 13 days for the Hindu mourning period. Then he retaliated.”
Up to 900 million people, an eighth of the world’s population, will vote in India’s gargantuan elections, that start on 11 April and continue for six weeks. Their choice will be driven by local grievances, national issues, their caste or class, and rumours and misinformation shared online.
Quick guide India's election Show Hide
Up to 900m Indians will vote over the next six weeks in a democratic contest that dwarfs any other. More than 11m polling officials and security personnel are involved, and for security reasons, the contest is broken down into seven phases, which allows teams of federal police — who are considered more impartial than their local counterparts — to monitor each one of the country’s 800,000 polling stations.
Indian law requires that no voter should have to travel more than 2km to cast their ballot. In several famous examples, teams of voting officials and police are dispatched to remote areas to set up booths so that a single registered resident can vote.
Voting machines are shuttled across the country by road in the country’s hinterland, boat in places such as the Andaman and Nicobar islands, through snow in the Himalayas, by camel in the desert of Rajastan and elephant in the Assamese jungle.
Votes will be counted throughout the day on 23 May with results released at the same time, so we should know by end of day the makeup of parliament - although several days of squabbling over a coalition government could ensue if nobody has won a majority.Up to 900m Indians will vote over the next six weeks in a democratic contest that dwarfs any other.

Thank you for your feedback. Above all, however, it will be a referendum on Modi, the country’s most powerful and polarising prime minister in generations.
Graphic Agra is a competitive seat in Uttar Pradesh, the most fiercely contested state in the country. With a population believed to be greater than Brazil’s, UP, as the state is known, offers 80 of the Indian parliament’s 543 seats – enough to make or break Indian governments. Modi swept it at the last election. Can he do it again? The Observer hit the campaign trail to try to find out.
The starting point was a rally in Agra late last month where the BJP was launching its state campaign in front of thousands of people, with dozens more watching from nearby rooftops.
A half dozen small cooling fans worked pointlessly to dent the heat. Snipes against Pakistan, India’s arch-rival with which it has clashed for more than half a century, raised the loudest cheers.
The chief guest was the BJP’s president, Amit Shah, who was presented on stage with a garland the audience was told weighed a mighty 51kg. “To give back to Pakistan,” roared Shah, “to fight back against terrorism, to fight corruption, you should choose our prime minister.”
Curious how the rally’s muscular rhetoric was impressing female voters, I asked a group of women in bright saris if they supported Modi. They agreed they did, but not with a conviction that withstood scrutiny.

“We are poor people,” said one dressed in teal, who didn’t want to give her name. “A BJP lady came to our village and told us to come. We just go where people tell us. If you ask us to go somewhere, we go.”
Graphic Fighting Pakistan was fine, she said, but Modi had not delivered on what mattered to her most. “Jobs,” she said. “Our kids are educated, they’re filling out forms, but they’re not getting work. I have three daughters and a son. I have to get them married, but none has a job.”
Was she voting for Modi? “Last time we gave [our votes] to him,” she said, to murmurs of agreement among the women. “But this time we won’t.”
By the exit gate, a Modi fan dressed in the Indian tricolours wore a portrait of the Indian leader around his neck. He had scrawled on it a short paean to Modi’s chest. It simply read, “56”.
By calling some of Indian politics’ most basic tenets into question, Modi has caused an earthquake. Before him, contemporary elections were thought to be a game of assembling winning coalitions out of the country’s myriad regional and caste-based parties. No single party had won an outright parliamentary majority in three decades.
Modi’s popularity is making strange bedfellows of his opponents: political parties that have been bitter enemies for decades, such as UP’s Bahujan Samaj party and the Samajwadi party, are now forming alliances united by little else than the desire to beat him.
People who have a government job are seen with different eyes, that our daughter will be happy with this guy
Will their traditional voters stomach this? Can Modi’s party persuade Hindus to vote as a united bloc instead? Or, as Indians grow richer, will they increasingly be guided by issues, such as Modi’s promises of development, or warnings that his authoritarian style is undermining the country’s democracy?
Pradeep Chhibber, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, believes India is in flux, and that nobody really knows. “The truth is, we don’t have a theory of the vote,” he says. “We don’t know why Indians vote the way they do. I wish we did.”
We had met a young man at the rally named Pushpender Baghel, who invited us to see him the following day. He was studying for India’s civil service exams, a notoriously gruelling series of tests demanding knowledge of topics ranging from the origins of the French revolution to the meaning of laissez-faire economics and the composition of clouds.
About 900,000 people apply each year; fewer than 900 make the cut. The reward is what young Indians and their families prize most: a secure government job.
Baghel had sequestered himself in a training academy for the past few months before the first stage of the exams in June, studying for at least 10 hours every day. He gave Modi seven marks out of 10. “Jobs have not been created as people want. Modi needs to work on this. But five years is not enough time.”
Modi sailed into office in 2014 on a wave of young voters. Baghel, 24, belongs to a generation weaned on promises that India is close to becoming a global superpower, and who have adjusted their expectations accordingly.
But India’s world-beating economic growth is increasingly focused in sectors that are creating fewer formal jobs – many times less than is required in a country where a million people turn 18 every month.
Modi was supposed to change that, promising in 2014 to create 250m jobs in a decade. In February a leaked government survey – that Modi disputes, and which his government allegedly tried to suppress – revealed unemployment has grown on his watch to the highest levels in 45 years.
And so the allure of a government job remains. “This expectation is not set by us, it’s set by our community,” Baghel said. “People who have a government job are seen with different eyes. People think they have a secure job, that our daughter will be happy with this guy.”
It was marriage more than the stable income that drove their ambition, he added. “If marriage wasn’t there, people could do what they want. They could take time to learn, to think critically, or just be on their own. But our community doesn’t permit this.
“People want a government job, so they can have prestigious marriages, and their social status can remain at top level,” he said.
After a two-hour drive from Agra, spent mostly on dirt tracks cut into wheat and potato fields that stretched to the horizon, Daujiram Raj appeared before us like a mirage in the village of Banni. His eyes were swollen and he carried a large stick. “The whole night I’ve been here, like a watchdog over my farm,” he said.
Indian farming, an industry that still provides jobs for up to 67% of the country, is in deep trouble. Incomes have fallen to their lowest point in 18 years. Burdened with debts, often on usurious terms from local moneylenders, thousands of farmers are killing themselves each year.
In Uttar Pradesh, an additional problem has lumbered into view. In 2017, in line with election promises to protect cows, the BJP started enforcing laws against their slaughter that had been on the statute books for years. This disrupted an illegal, if widely accepted, practice among farmers, including Hindu ones, of disposing of unproductive cows by selling them to Muslim-owned abattoirs. Most of those abattoirs are shut now, and old cows and bulls are being abandoned on a mass scale.
Farmers such as Raj have been forced to fence their crops and spend all night in tiny watch houses, repelling waves of bovine charges. “There are 200 cows here in this village that attack our fields at night,” he said. “We shine torches in their eyes but sometimes we have to go and shoo them off. They follow us [and] try to kill people who follow them.”
The cows have divided up Raj’s farmlands like a mafia. “Half of them will eat from this area,” he said, pointing to one side of the road, “and half will eat from other”. Turf wars are regular. “They also have their own fights when one eats from the other’s area,” he said. A few metres away, the culprits lounged in what used to be a gooseberry field. They had since denuded it, forcing its owners to pack up and leave for Agra city. About two dozen cows and bulls reclined in the dirt, chewing loudly and twitching their tails, barely raising their heads to look as Raj led us through the field.
Their imperiousness is not misplaced. The animals are revered by many Hindus as the symbol of non-violence. But some Hindus are willing to do violence to protect them. Modi’s rise has coincided with the formation of vigilante bands across north India, who have killed and wounded dozens of Muslims and low-caste Hindus accused of harming cows.
Raj and the other farmers are frustrated but fear that driving the animals out, even peacefully, might draw an armed response. “Of course the cow is a goddess for us,” Raj said. “But now they have become too much for us to handle or feed.”
Still, he adds, he will be voting for the BJP this year. “This is the problem we have in our village,” he says. “If this is sorted out, then we have no problem with the government.”

We broke up the drive back to Agra near a village called Bamba, stopping for lunch at a farmers’ market. There, Chaudhry Khan Singh sat cross-legged, tending to a boiling pot of chai. “Nothing has improved in the past eight years,” he said. But Singh had been paying attention to the way Modi was received in foreign capitals. At home, the Indian leader emphasises his humble background as a railway tea-seller. Abroad, he plays the rock star, giving speeches to screaming stadiums full of Indian migrants in london and New York. In 2015 Modi met Barack Obama while wearing a £10,000 suit patterned with his name written over and over again.
Critics frequently raise this contradiction, but overlook the jolt of pride people such as Singh feel as they observe the overseas tours. “Whatever respect we have earned outside has been because of Modi,” he said.
Despite his glum assessment of India’s progress, Singh had personally benefited from one of Modi’s signature programmes. A few years ago, his household had its first toilet installed, as part of a national drive to reduce diseases associated with public defecation. The government says more than 90m toilets have been built under the programme. Singh was satisfied, but still smarted that a local official had made him pay a bribe to build the facility.
Listening in, Pushpa Devi, a woman with a broom in hand, said she had recently received a natural gas connection in her house. It was another unsexy Modi government programme that has nonetheless improved lives. With a gas stove, Devi said, she cooked less frequently using wood or cow dung; that meant less of the toxic indoor air pollution that kills a million Indians a year, and fewer hours searching for fuel.
We invited Devi to sit, but she declined. Out of earshot of the men at the tea stand, she explained that she was a dalit, formerly called the untouchables, India’s least socially powerful caste. She couldn’t sit on our level at a chai stall, she explained. “If I sit with you, I’m insulting you.”
Devi voted for Modi in 2014 but only because the head of her village told her to, she said. “Whatever he says, I vote.” She was voting for him again for the same reason, but not enthusiastically. “Except for the [gas] cylinders, I don’t see that he’s done anything for me. I can’t open my mouth, I can’t drink from the government water supply,” she said.
Yet on election day, her headman would lead her and others to the voting booth. “When there is an election, that time they will not say I’m untouchable,” she said. “They put me in the line with everybody else.”
Back in one of Agra’s older quarters, metal roller-doors were being slammed shut on rows of meat shops in a predominantly Muslim street. In a basement, Sami Aghai sat by a fan in a cramped office. “Muslims will vote for Congress,” he said, referring to India’s establishment party, which has produced three prime ministers and just inducted a latest family member, Priyanka Gandhi, into national politics. “We have no alternative.”
Modi’s rise has been confrontational for many Muslims. He is a lifelong adherent of the Hindu nationalist movement. Hindutva, as it is known, is a political ideology distinct from Hinduism, the faith. It emerged as part of a global wave of rightwing nationalist movements in the 1920s, and envisages Hindus as a single nation with a sacred culture that should be emphasised above all others. Consigned to the margins, in this vision, are India’s millions of minority citizens, including the almost 200-million-strong Muslim population.

“The BJP has destroyed communal harmony in the past five years,” said Aghai, the national president of the Indian Muslim Development Council.
While Modi was the chief minister of Gujarat, the state witnessed its worst religious riots this century, when at least 1,000 people, mostly Muslims, were slaughtered. There has been no such rioting in the past five years, but individual attacks on Muslims have surged, according to a database tracking bias crimes.
India’s Muslim heritage is also being gradually undermined in myriad ways, petty and consequential. Allahabad, a city in Uttar Pradesh, was recently restored to its pre-Islamic era name, Prayagraj. Foreign dignitaries who visit the state no longer receive models of the Taj Mahal as souvenirs, because they “do not reflect Indian culture”, according to the chief minister, Yogi Adityanath – himself a Hindutva firebrand who has spent time in jail on charges of fomenting anti-Muslim violence.
Aghai flicked through the camera roll of his phone, showing pictures of Muslims and low-caste Hindus who have been lynched in the past five years. “Remember me when you vote,” was written under each photograph. “I got these on Facebook,” he said. “Whenever I go somewhere for social work, I show them these photos.”
India’s online population has doubled in the past five years to 500 million people. India is the largest market for both Facebook and WhatsApp. The proliferation of smartphones is changing every facet of Indian life, including politics, and both platforms have rolled out extensive measures to combat disinformation and fake news. But only so much can be filtered.
A woman’s dulcet voice began to play from Aghai’s phone, a menacing song that has gone viral since a militant from the disputed Kashmir region killed 40 Indian paramilitaries in February.
“The soldiers who were martyred in Pulwama were not killed by our enemies,” the sweet voice sang. “They lost their lives because someone from our own country betrayed us. Our enemies are in our own house. You keep accusing our neighbours – why don’t you kill those who are ready to stab us in the back?”
Our last stop before leaving Agra was the home of the man who the city’s politicians seek out when they want an electoral edge. “Our soul knows everything,” declared numerologist Ritu Vardhan Sharma as we sat in his cavernous living room, bare but for a table, some chairs, and an African grey parrot in the corner. “It knows what is going to happen in this world and what will happen in the future.” He motioned at a pendulum and two dowsing instruments on his table. “When we hold these, our soul gives a message to our muscles, and the muscles give the results by the instruments.”
Astrology is serious business in India, and many, including politicians, still seek the counsel of a local diviner before making decisions. “When they see me, only one question is there,” says Sharma, a burly man in flowing white Indian dress. “Am I winning or not?”
He had agreed to provide us the same service, predicting who would triumph when votes are counted on 23 May. He carefully wrote the possible seat totals for the BJP horizontally across a sheet of paper. Then he lifted the copper pendulum and shut his eyes.
For the next few minutes, Sharma entered a state of intense focus, undisturbed by our presence, nor by the pulsing beat of LMFAO’s Sexy and You Know It blaring from his daughter’s bedroom upstairs. The pendulum, which had swung wildly, began to settle and then swing determinedly towards one outcome on the sheet: a minimum 275-seat BJP majority.
Sharma was ready to make his prediction. “I can give you a guarantee that the prime minister will be Narendra Modi,” he declared. “100%.”
The people we met in Agra had not been so enthusiastic. The realities of governing have taken the sheen off Modi. But voters in Uttar Pradesh still wanted to believe in him: that an Indian leader could deliver dynamic, incorruptible government; that an ageing prime minister really could have a 56-inch chest.

Extend by 12 months or go next week.
If we took the 12 month option would that also give a timeframe where we can see BoJo and co in court ?
I despair of the MSM actually taking the ERG, Labour Left etc to shreds as they should be over the crap they come out with.
But BoJo under oath being cross examined by a top QC could actually prove more enlightning to the general population."

The price of many more on-field red cards from tougher and more consistent referees backed up by off-field arrests, charges for abuse and serious punishments for those found guilty might just get thugs on and off the pitch to reflect before they offend."
