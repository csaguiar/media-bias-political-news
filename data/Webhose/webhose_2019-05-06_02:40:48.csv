White House chief of staff Mulvaney tells Dems they will NEVER SEE Trump’s taxes! – The Right Scoop,therightscoop.com,,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://therightscoop.com/white-house-chief-of-staff-mulvaney-tells-dems-they-will-never-see-trumps-taxes/,"Mick Mulvaney made it clear that Democrats were indeed “moronic” as Romney said, to try to use legislative powers to get Trump’s tax returns.
Watch below:
Here’s what he said:
Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said Sunday that Democrats will “never” see President Trump’s tax returns.
“Nor should they. That’s an issue that was already litigated during the election. Voters knew the president could have given his tax returns, they knew that he didn’t, and they elected him anyway,” Mulvaney said during an appearance on “Fox News Sunday.”
He added that Democrats “know they’re not going to” get the tax returns.
“They just want attention on the issue because they don’t want to talk to us about policy,” he said.
Last week, House Democrats formally requested Trump’s tax returns, with Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal (D-Mass.) asking IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig to turn over six years of Trump’s personal and business tax returns.
The media is running with this but I think the context that Mulvaney is talking about includes Democrats using the legislative powers to get his taxes. Now, I also think he’ll never release him on his own, but the Mueller report ending without more indictments really undercuts their justification for such a demand. If there was evidence of wrongdoing, then they could be justified. In this case, it just looks like they’re just randomly looking for stuff. Total: 27"
Netflix teases Homecoming from Beyoncé: The new film comes to the streaming service April 17.,slate.com,Matthew Dessem,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/beyonce-netflix-homecoming-coachella-documentary.html,"Beyoncé performing at Coachella on April 14 of last year. Larry Busacca/Getty Images for Coachella It was inevitable that Beyoncé, undisputed queen of surprise album releases , and Netflix, undisputed king of surprise Cloverfield sequel releases , would one day join forces. Beyoncé has mastered the art surprising and delighting her fans with completely unexpected masterpieces like Lemonade ; Netflix has mastered the art of surprising and baffling its customers by harrowing other studios’ development hells for projects that could plausibly be rebranded as completely unexpected masterpieces. Speaking of surprises, here’s one: the first collaboration between the two reigning monarchs of unexpected releases comes with ten days advance warning. On Sunday, Netflix tweeted out an announcement that something Beyoncé-related would be coming to the streaming network on April 17. — Netflix US (@netflix) April 7, 2019 That’s just a few days past the one-year anniversary of Beyoncè’s instantly-legendary performance at Coachella , and the typography, colors, and collegiate theme seem to confirm that Netflix will be getting into the Beyoncé at Coachella business. Us Weekly reported last week that the singer had a Netflix documentary on the way, but it’s not clear yet if this will be a behind-the-scenes look at her performance, a traditional concert film, or some sort of visual album. Netflix being Netflix, though, it’s also possible that we’re in for Beyoncé Presents: A Science-Fiction Movie Paramount Didn’t Think Would Make Any Money.

Measles is an airborne virus, transmitted by respiratory droplets from the nose, mouth, or throat of an infected person, so usually through coughing or sneezing. Small-particle aerosols from someone with measles can stay suspended in air for long periods of time after the person has left a room, and the virus can live on surfaces for up to two hours.”

In their previous works, Israeli choreographers Yossi Berg and Oded Graf dealt with politics, violence, masculinity, nationality, societal conceptions and cultural stereotypes, but they have never before researched love.A life and work couple of many years, Berg and Graf recently found themselves in the throes of a creative process in which sappy love songs and stories of lost relationships filled the studio, and it thrilled them. “Visual artist Nir Segal approached us to participate in his exhibition in a gallery called Raw Art,” explains Graf over the phone.Just a week away from the Tel Aviv premiere of When Love Walked In, Graf is in New York City while Berg is on an extended hiking trip. They will reconvene in their home city in a few days to make final adjustments on the piece before revealing it at Tmuna Theater. “We went through many evolutions in how we would participate and how we would use the gallery, and what meanings it could give our work to present in the gallery. It really excited us to look at dance from a different perspective, perhaps through the lens of visual art. It was a very intriguing beginning for us. Aside from the conditions – which already put in a lot of information into the process – the space, the unified lighting that everyone is in, and Nir’s exhibition, really fed into what we did. It gave a very specific situation to begin working with.”The word intimacy came up over and again as Berg and Graf wrapped their heads around the gallery environment in which they would perform. “We were very interested in composing a different kind of relationship between the performers and the audience. It interested us to think how dance can be present in the bodies of the viewers in a much deeper way than it had been in our previous works. We were very curious about the embodiment of dance in the audience. Those questions guided us through the process.”Though they hadn’t planned on creating a “love dance,” Berg and Graf felt pulled in to the subject. “If in previous works we dealt with militarism, here we felt we couldn’t. Perhaps because of the political situation, what moves us most is working on love. The work with intimacy brought up a lot of questions. We talked about physical and textual representations of love in our culture. We went to see pictures and sculptures that are meant to depict love. We listened to a lot of songs that speak of love. And slowly it became a type of material.”As they delved into the new territory inhabited by love, Berg and Graf came upon a chasm between the representation of love and how it is experienced. They took this gap to their cast, which is comprised of Berg, as well as Tal Adler Arieli and Ofri Mantel. Together, the four discussed their life stories, their experiences with loves of different kinds, and their perspectives on intimacy. “In the experience of love, there is something very complex, three-dimensional and rough in spite of its representation which is very flat, frustrating and plastic,” adds Graf. “We tried to ask a lot of questions about the real and the fake, and how they both can express the truth. A lot of times the plastic can express a big truth that the realistic can’t. Sometimes the fantasy can encapsulate a big truth that we can’t see in real life.”The love they were dealing with came from many sources. On one hand, there is the love between Berg and Graf, which was the starting canvas for this creation. Then, there was the blossoming love between the two and their team, which included the dancers, fellow choreographer Rachel Erdos as an outside eye, Nadav Barnea, who composed the soundtrack, and director Nava Zuckerman, who brought her keen eye to the work. Finally, there was the love of dance. “Our love of dance came up a lot. We felt in a few works, like Rite of Spring and some works we made for students, our love for dance was getting stronger in a surprising way. We had a crisis about what dance’s place is and what it can do. I feel that our passion for dance is getting larger. I’m very interested in what dance can do and be.”With this love-fest in hand, Berg, Graf and team dove into the gallery environs. Not surprisingly, the audience’s response, specifically from the duo’s devout followers, was enthusiastic. “People could really relate somehow,” says Graf. Now Berg and Graf will take what they learned in the gallery and apply it to their comfort zone – the theater. Next week’s performances will take place in Tmuna Theater’s parking lot, but Graf assures that the warmth and coziness will be preserved, even in that cavernous space. When Love Walked In will be performed at Tmuna Theater on April 12 and 13. For more information, visit tmu-na.org.il .

With Hamas targeting the country’s center more frequently, Israel needs a radical shift in its missile defense strategy, former deputy head of IDF Military Intelligence Brig.-Gen. Meir Elran wrote in an Institute for National Security Studies post on Sunday.According to the post, after making initial jumps forward in missile defense surrounding the 2012 and 2014 wars with Hamas, especially with Iron Dome, the defense ministry may have gotten complacent. Elran wrote that ending the complacency is not merely critical to protect individually targeted Israeli communities, but also to giving the security cabinet the time and patience to make balanced decisions about war and peace.In contrast, there is a concern that if Gazan rockets smash into cities and communities in the center of the country, decision-makers would be under populist pressures to act without properly weighing the long-term consequences.Bar Ilan University and IDF Command College lecturer Dr. Carmit Padan – who specializes in organizational sociology and preparedness – co-wrote the INSS post with Elran.Conceptually, in terms of tactics, the IDF and other arms of the nation’s home front defense have invested considerably to defend Israeli communities on the Gaza periphery, and critical Israeli cities and infrastructure, wrote Elran.But that mentality only does well in a full-scale war and as long as Hamas is targeting those key spots, he suggested.Recently, he noted, Gazan rocket crews have repeatedly launched long-range rockets, even in the absence of a general war.When they have done so, the post says they have targeted communities in Israel’s center that do not appear to be viewed as critical enough to have an Iron Dome battery assigned to them.Elran wrote that Israel needs more of these anti-ballistic batteries to protect vulnerable areas in the country’s center.In addition, while praising the increase in early warning systems to compartmentalize the country into 250 separate regions, he said significant work needs to be done to move the country to the 1,800 regions it is meant to be divided into.The former IDF deputy intelligence chief said priority must be given to placing early warning systems in areas in the country’s center which Hamas has been less likely to attack, short of a general war, until now.The INSS post said these areas must also undergo civilian defense drills as take place in Gaza periphery communities, so that home front officials and ordinary citizens are trained to respond to such attacks.Until these changes are made, Elran said that Hamas may use “surgical” attacks on ill-prepared communities in central Israel not protected by Iron Dome batteries in order to strike terror and chaos without Israel responding with a declaration of war. More batteries and proper preparation of communities in the country’s vulnerable center could neutralize any strategic advantage Hamas has identified, and reduce the terrorist group’s incentive for this method of attack, he said. Elran also said that the government should aggressively implement the recommendations of a May 2018 commission regarding the delineation of the defense roles of the various home front agencies, as well as local government authorities. Along those lines, the INSS post endorsed the State Comptroller’s March 27 report about the lack of readiness of the country’s rescue teams. Finally, Elran noted that challenges posed by Hamas rockets apply as well for any future conflict with Hezbollah, whose arsenal includes more precise and sophisticated missiles than those of Hamas.

"Trump tells American Jews that Benjamin Netanyahu is ""your prime minister"" | Salon.com",www.salon.com,,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.salon.com/2019/04/07/trump-tells-american-jews-that-benjamin-netanyahu-is-your-prime-minister/,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu; Donald Trump (Getty/Kobi Gideon) Trump tells American Jews that Benjamin Netanyahu is ""your prime minister"" Trump told a meeting of Republican Jews that Netanyahu was ""your prime minister"" -- Your message has been sent successfully Send email to: //www.salon.com/2019/04/07/trump-tells-american-jews-that-benjamin-netanyahu-is-your-prime-minister/ Send Matthew Rozsa April 7, 2019 7:45PM (UTC)
President Donald Trump is facing harsh criticism from American Jewish groups and individuals after he told a Republican Jewish group that Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu was ""your prime minister.""
During a speech at a Republican Jewish Coalition event on Saturday, Trump touted his own supposedly pro-Israel record as president by telling the assembled Republicans that ""I stood with your prime minister at the White House to recognize Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights,"" according to The Jerusalem Post . The president later made another comment conflating American Jews with Israelis, telling the assembly that ""if implemented, the Democrats' radical agenda would destroy our economy, cripple our country, and very well could leave Israel out there all by yourselves. Can't do that."" Advertisement:
American Jewish groups have roundly condemned Trump's comments.
""Mr. President, the Prime Minister of Israel is the leader of his (or her) country, not ours. Statements to the contrary, from staunch friends or harsh critics, feed bigotry,"" tweeted the American Jewish Committee .
Similarly Jonathan Greenblatt, the CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, tweeted that ""Mr. President, words matter. As with all elected officials, its [sic] critical for you to avoid language that leads people to believe Jews aren’t loyal Americans.""
Leah Greenberg, co-executive director of Indivisible Team, tweeted , ""So the President of the United States gave a speech indicating that he thinks American Jews are actually foreigners. Let’s hear from every single Republican official whether they agree, and if not, when they’ll condemn his remarks.""
On the Israeli side, Haaretz columnist Allison Kaplan Sommer noted the irony of Trump criticizing Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., for causing ""the terrible scourge of anti-Semitism to take root in their party and their country"" and then drawing on the dual loyalty canard.
""Trump himself then proceeded to raise the specter of Jewish dual loyalty and allegiance by repeatedly failing to distinguish between the 1,500 American Jews to whom he was speaking and Jewish Israelis,"" Sommer wrote. Advertisement:
She later added, ""While he didn’t use the term 'Benjamins,' Trump did refer to 'your people' when discussing his economic policy — which evokes imagery of Jewish tribalism and a cabal, and comes on the heels of previous remarks he has made related to Jews and money.""
Ironically Netanyahu has recently promised that if he defeats former military chief Benny Gantz, he will annex Israeli settlements in the West Bank.
""I will impose sovereignty, but I will not distinguish between settlement blocs and isolated settlements,"" Netanyahu told a reporter, according to the Associated Press . ""From my perspective, any point of settlement is Israeli, and we have responsibility, as the Israeli government. I will not uproot anyone, and I will not transfer sovereignty to the Palestinians.""

Chris Cuomo: Trump Did His Least At The Border,trulyrightview.com,trulymain1,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://trulyrightview.com/2019/04/chris-cuomo-trump-did-his-least-at-the-border/,"April 7th, 2019 | Add a Comment
CNN: Chris Cuomo says President Trump missed an opportunity to make meaningful change when he visited the southern border.
CUOMO: So, my argument was simple and strategic. “Mr. President, if you’re going to the Border, don’t just go look at a fence and extend a farce.”
The justification for this part was the fence he went to isn’t new construction. He can say it is it, doesn’t make it so. It’s replacement fence that was planned for before this POTUS was even elected.
The deception of the reality was fitting, if you think about it, because the fence farce was a redo to begin with, pretending to build something he hasn’t, just an extension of other demagogues past.
My argument was it would have been a great opportunity to shift and embrace the humanity that is the actuality. He’s demonstrably wrong that the crisis is fixed by a wall.
You see the numbers. You heard CBP. Take a look at your screen. You heard the DHS Secretary.
It is kids and families and the flow at the points of entry. Fence doesn’t fix it alone. So, if he went there, looked at the faces, showed he cared, that would put him in the right space.
And there was a second stage. Use the emergency declaration to send resources to the Border that they need. In one stroke, you go where almost no one in Congress has, you show that you care, and you do something about it that puts Congress in a position to have to act.
But as many as you guessed, that was not a move that could make it into his head, nor certainly into his heart. Now look, I’m no fool. And if I am, I’m a fool for hope. I believe in change. I’m about redemption and doing better.
Instead, this POTUS did his least. He faked the fence. He didn’t visit the kids. And when he did decide to address the devastating dynamic of kids and families flooding our Border, he said the worst thing he could.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: The system is full, can’t take you anymore. Whether it’s asylum, whether it’s anything you want, it’s illegal immigration, can’t take you anymore. We can’t take you. Our country is full. Our area is full. The sector is full. Can’t take you anymore, I’m sorry.
(END VIDEO CLIP) CUOMO: It’s like the opposite of the Statue of Liberty. No compassion, no conviction for finding a solution, and no real connection to reality.
Look, he is right. The system is overwhelmed. But now what? You can’t end asylum. Certainly, not himself, no more than he can change the 14th Amendment and end birthright citizenship by himself. Even Alex Jones knows that.
Here’s the regret. When given a chance to show his best, to make Congress see there is someone, there is something to work with, that it’s not all lies and fake solutions and shows of pretend strength he reinforced every dark notion about himself.
But before you say, I told you so, to me, don’t be so quick to embrace the cynicism that powers our President. Democratic Members of Congress went down there – there today. I hear a hearing is scheduled.
Calling out power to do their job and exposing need is not a pointless act. I argue it is the point of my job. If nothing else, you allow, you guys, you can listen, you can see what’s wrong, and to our leaders, who are looking for an opportunity, you can create one to do better.
Lord knows, when it comes to handling the crisis on the Border, anything that anyone gets done in government will be an improvement.
So, while some, like Don, say “Step back. He’s never going to do it,” I say, “Step up.” I say, “We know that we can do better.” He has to know he can do better. And that’s why I say “Let’s get after it.”
As we see with our fear-loving leader, left to their own devices, our elected leaders cannot be counted on to act as we would like. But here’s my pitch to him again. I’m trying again.
You already have all the people who bought into the fence out of fear of this Brown Menace. You need more. People care about these kids. They care about their families. Show that you do too. And there’s a win in it for you. How about that?

On Real Time Friday, comedian Chelsea Handler talked about how she had a “mid-life identity crisis once Trump won” and mentioned that she “had to pay a psychiatrist” to listen to her “bitch about Donald Trump for about the first three weeks.” She then compared the election of President Trump to the death of her brother when she was nine years old; mentioning that she felt a “huge emotional trigger of everything being destabilized” in both cases. She closed her anti-Trump rant by talking about how she “just wanted to f***ing fight people” in the wake of his election and reiterated her need to see a psychiatrist because of her Trump Derangement Syndrome.

Friday’s edition of Real Time With Bill Maher contained the usual amount of Anti-Trump venom one would come to expect from the HBO program. For starters, author Salman Rushdie compared America under President Trump to a third-world dictatorship: “I’ve spent a certain amount of my life in third-world countries, which have had military dictatorships and very corrupt civilian dictatorships…It’s very depressing to see this country behaving like that.” Host Bill Maher abruptly changed the topic, proceeding to peddle a conspiracy theory about President Trump suffering from dementia: “This week was quite a week for the dementia watch. I mean, the President could not pronounce the word origins. He could not name where his father was born. He thought his father was born in Germany. He said windmills cause cancer.”

CBS's ""Face the Nation"" host Margaret Brennan on Sunday pressed President Trump Robert Swan Mueller Sasse: US should applaud choice of Mueller to lead Russia probe MORE 's investigation.
With Giuliani appearing on ""Face the Nation"" for an interview Sunday, Brennan said he was ""impugning their credibility"" while also ""accepting and supporting their conclusions"" in reference to Mueller's team, which investigated Russian interference in the 2016 election.
""That’s a bit contradictory,"" she said. ""You’re accusing them of bias but you agree with their conclusions."" . @RudyGiuliani told @margbrennan that “the Mueller group has been leaking all along.”MARGARET BRENNAN: “But for 22 months, you have to acknowledge the special counsel's office did not leak.”
Giuliani, who denied that his positions were contradictory, has accused members on Mueller's team of being ""sneaky, unethical leakers"" and ""rabid Democrats who hate the president of the United States."" He added Sunday that the ""Mueller group has been leaking all along.""
Giuliani has also praised the conclusions of the special counsel's investigation that Attorney General William Barr William Pelham Barr The Hill's 12:30 Report: Barr says there was 'spying' on Trump campaign Finally united, House Republicans refer ex-Trump lawyer Michael Cohen for perjury prosecution Fox News legal analyst: 'There must be some evidence' of criminal activity in Mueller report MORE summarized last month in a letter to lawmakers. Barr said Mueller determined that the Trump campaign did not conspire with Russia ahead of the 2016 presidential election.
Giuliani said Sunday on ""Face the Nation"" that he accepted the conclusions ""because there is nothing there.""
""And they tried to make things up,"" he claimed. ""They put so much pressure on people, keeping them in solid confinement."

Donald John Trump Trump's base will never think he's ineffectual on the border, says political editor Sanders: Trump's call to abolish filibuster should make one 'nervous' Stephen Miller wants Trump to dismiss more senior officials at DHS: report MORE , calling him a ""biased defender of the administration."" ""Remember, he is a biased person,"" Nadler said on CBS's ""Face The Nation."" ""He is someone who is an agent of the administration. He is a political appointee of the president, whose interests he may very well be protecting here."" ADVERTISEMENT Nadler later added that he dismissed what Barr said in his four-page summary of special counsel Robert Mueller Robert Swan Mueller Sasse: US should applaud choice of Mueller to lead Russia probe MORE 's investigation into Russian interference and possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Moscow. He justified his stance by saying that Barr is ""a biased defender of the administration."" ""He's entitled to be a defender of the administration, but he's not entitled to withhold the evidence from Congress,"" said Nadler, who has repeatedly called for the public release of Mueller's report and the underlying evidence for his conclusions. The comments from Nadler came just weeks after Mueller concluded his nearly two year-long investigation. Barr said in a summary that the special counsel did not uncover evidence to conclude that a conspiracy took place between the Trump campaign and Russia. Mueller did not make a definitive stance on obstruction of justice allegations. But Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein decided Mueller did not provide sufficient evidence of obstruction of justice to pursue it. The summary says that Mueller does not exonerate Trump on the issue. Barr has said that he expects to release Mueller's report on the investigation by mid-April. Nadler said on CBS that the attorney general should not redact any of the material before sending it to the House Judiciary Committee."

A power struggle over Tripoli threatens to push Libya further into chaos,www.vox.com,Amanda Sakuma,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.vox.com/world/2019/4/7/18299388/libya-crisis-tripoli-air-strikes-armed-conflict,"Forces loyal to Libyan strongman Khalifa Haftar patrolling in downtown Sebha, the biggest city in southern Libya in February. AFP/Getty Images Libyan militias battling for control of the country’s capital, Tripoli, launched air strikes against one another on Sunday, escalating a battle that has raged since Thursday. The battle began when the Libyan National Army (LNA), a force in control of most of Eastern Libya, launched a surprise offensive on Tripoli. That attack threatens to reinvigorate the armed conflict in a country marred by instability since former dictator Muammar Qaddafi was deposed in 2011. The LNA is led by General Khalifa Haftar, who fled to the US after his first failed coup attempt against Qaddafi. Haftar launched the latest attack in hopes of fulfilling a promise to unite Libya under his control. Standing in his way are armed factions defending the capital and its internationally recognized, UN-backed government, the Government of National Accord (GNA). The LNA firstadvanced on the southern and western outskirts of the capital in an assault that left dozens dead and many more wounded, the BBC reports . Haftar claimed to have seized Tripoli’s airport — which is roughly 15 miles from the center of the city — in the LNA’s first strike, but fighting is reported to have continued there through Sunday. Colonel Mohamed Gnounou of the forces loyal to the GNA said on Sunday his troops plan on “ purging all Libyan cities of aggressor and illegitimate forces ” in a counteroffensive called “Volcano of Anger.” This counteroffensive continued as tensions further escalated Sunday when LNA forces unleashed air strikes on the city’s suburbs. Those airstrikes were met in turn with airstrikes by GNA forces . The air strikes come in spite of calls from the United Nations asking for a two-hour truce to help evacuate citizens and wounded fighters. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres was in Tripoli on Friday preparing for talks scheduled for next week that were meant to lay the groundwork for democratic elections. Later in the day, Guterres tweeted that he was leaving Libya “with a heavy heart” as violence intensified. I leave Libya with a heavy heart and deeply concerned. I still hope it is possible to avoid a bloody confrontation in and around Tripoli. The UN is committed to facilitating a political solution and, whatever happens, the UN is committed to supporting the Libyan people. — António Guterres (@antonioguterres) April 5, 2019 Haftar, a 75-year-old general who once served under Qaddafi, returned to Libya in 2011 to aid in the revolution against the dictator. After Qaddafi was deposed, Haftar eventually became the leader of militia forces controlling the country’s eastern region. He’s a staunch anti-Islamist general backed by Egypt and the United Arab Emirates. Haftar has also received aid from Russia and from France, which partnered with the general in hopes he could help slow African immigration. Despite this support, there are lingering worries that Haftar could turn out to be little more than a Gaddafi 2.0. The Washington Post’s Fahmi Hussein and Sudarsan Raghavan filed a dispatch from the city of Misurata on Saturday, where militia forces who say Haftar reminds them of Qaddafi claimed to have deployed hundreds of truckloads of fighters to help in the fight against Haftar. Many Misurata residents — and the city’s militias — despise Hifter and view him as another dictator in the making. Militias from other pro-government cities such as Zintan also moved into Tripoli, according to photos posted on social media. In Misurata, a radio station sent out a rallying cry to listeners: “Everyone who owns a gun please go to Tripoli right away to fight for your country against Hifter.” As the fighting continues, US troops stationed in Tripoli were ordered to evacuate the city. The US Africa Command announced Sunday it planned to relocate a contingent of US forces due to “increased unrest in Libya.” “The security realities on the ground in Libya are growing increasingly complex and unpredictable,” Marine Corps Gen. Thomas Waldhauser, the head of US Africa Command, said in a statement. “Even with an adjustment of the force, we will continue to remain agile in support of existing US strategy.” Next Up In World"
You’re the Worst’s finale was the perfect — and perfectly ambitious — sitcom ending,www.vox.com,Todd VanDerWerff,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/4/7/18295402/youre-the-worst-finale-recap-pancakes-season-5-wedding,"Jimmy and Gretchen promise to love each other in their own way in the You’re the Worst finale. FXX Every week, we pick a new episode of the week. It could be good. It could be bad. It will always be interesting. You can read the archives here . The episode of the week for March 31 through April 6 is “Pancakes,” the series finale of FXX’s You’re the Worst . The romantic comedy is always trying to run out the clock, at least on some level. The lovers meet and fall for each other. They kiss. They fall apart. Maybe they find their way back to each other by the end. It’s a time-worn, time-honored formula, one that gets harder to tweak and twist with every new spin on it that appears. And most rom-coms are movies or novels. They are finite, and unspool within a very compressed timeframe. They don’t have to deal with ramifications and consequences, with what happens after , with the idea that the story doesn’t just stop. That’s why the TV rom-com has a much spottier history. TV shows, after all, can run for years and years. It’s so easy to stretch out a will-they/won’t-they so far that it snaps, or to have nothing left to say once the lovers are together. Many a TV show has been felled by having no idea how to tell a love story over many seasons. What FXX’s You’re the Worst , which ended its five-season run on Wednesday, April 3, figured out was that the TV rom-com works best if you put the couple hooking up first . When the rest of the story becomes aftermath to consummation, well, that’s space for TV to play with. Over the course of You’re the Worst ’s five seasons, its two main lovers, Jimmy ( Chris Geere ) and Gretchen ( Aya Cash ), darted into and weaved throughout each other’s lives, never quite sure what kept drawing them back together or why the trappings of a conventional relationship — something both of them believed they didn’t want — seemed more palatable with each other than with anyone else. But the show’s series finale still had to resolve the question that all rom-coms have to answer, of whether the two belonged together forever. It had to do the thing all rom-coms do where the lovers either kiss and ride off into the sunset, or have one last, bittersweet meeting where they realize that while they’ve gained so much from knowing each other, they aren’t meant to be. And in “Pancakes” — You’re the Worst ’s final installment, and one of the best episodes of this terrific little series — the show somehow found a way to do both. How You’re the Worst was able to tell a sweet story about marriage without actually having its characters get married The real breakup in the final season turns out to be between former best friends Edgar and Jimmy. FXX The smartest thing the finale does is find a way to have a happy ending, while also acknowledging the tough realities of any long-lasting relationship. Jimmy and Gretchen don’t break up, but they also don’t get married. They choose, instead, to recommit to each other each and every day, believing that to be a better signifier of their love than a ceremony. This outcome is very in line with You’re the Worst ’s ethos of finding something beautiful in the midst of everything about life that’s hard to take. Indeed, the show’s writers essentially didn’t consider splitting up Jimmy and Gretchen at all. “Them just not being together was off the table, because I think that’s mean,” You’re the Worst creator Stephen Falk , who wrote and directed “Pancakes,” told me. “The audience has invested so many seasons in this couple you want to honor that and not just pull the rug out from under them.” Still, Falk and his team had to find a way to create some tension as the season approached its endpoint. To do this, they cribbed from Breaking Bad , of all things. As Jimmy and Gretchen planned their wedding, episodes would cut forward to some future that seemed much more grim, where the two were split up and seeing each other for the first time in years at some event, just as Breaking Bad ’s last season flashed forward to Walter White’s final stand . Surely You’re the Worst wouldn’t end with its central couple hating each other? Yet even as I watched those flash-forwards, I had a sneaking suspicion that in the end, they wouldn’t be as devastating as they seemed. I had been on set during the production of “Pancakes.” The scene I saw being filmed was, indeed, a devastating one, where both Jimmy and Gretchen admitted they weren’t sure they could fulfill the promise inherent in any wedding vows — to love one person forever — and seemed on the verge of calling the whole thing off. But I’d also been told that the venue where the episode was shot wasn’t just a fancy house up in the Los Angeles hills. It was where Falk’s own wedding had taken place. If he was going to break these two up forever, he probably wouldn’t do it there . Adding further fuel to my theory: Actor Chris Geere told me that if you look closely throughout the final episode, you’ll see family members of the show’s cast and crew scattered throughout the wedding scenes, including Falk’s own wife and kids. (A song Geere’s wife performed is part of the episode’s soundtrack.) The idea was to give the finale a bit of a “family album” feel, Geere said. I was right to suspect a breakup wasn’t imminent. In the end, the flash-forwards throughout You’re the Worst ’s final season turned out not to be teasing Jimmy and Gretchen’s breakup, but their ongoing project in effectively being married without ever actually getting married. They have a daughter together, and the big breakup the series was hinting at was actually between Jimmy and his best friend, Edgar ( Desmin Borges ), a man he’d long treated terribly and taken advantage of. The fight the two had in You’re the Worst ’s penultimate episode is revealed in the finale as what shattered the series’ core friend group. Thus, it’s actually Edgar, not Jimmy, who Gretchen hasn’t seen in ages, and their fight is the reason for Jimmy’s trepidation about attending the wedding in the flash-forwards (which turns out to be the second for supporting player Lindsey and her two-times-a-husband Paul). It could have honestly felt a little cheap, were it not for Falk’s commitment to finding a way for Jimmy and Gretchen to be together while still flaunting societal conventions. Their promise to choose to love each other, every day, just for that day, manages to more or less make their relationship official, without making it official-official. (Though I would recommend that for tax purposes, they at least do the paperwork for a legally sanctioned domestic partnership.) It’s a beautiful acknowledgement of the power of lifelong commitment that also nods to these characters’ particular aversion to doing things in more conventional fashion, to say nothing of You’re the Worst ’s constant attempts to at once invert and subvert rom-com tropes. Falk told me he first came up with the idea behind “Pancakes” when hearing Hugh Grant describe his relationship with his then-partner Anna Eberstein on Howard Stern’s show a few years ago. Grant described their relationship at the time as one where marriage would mostly be a formality, where the day-to-day work of building the relationship wasn’t immediately dependent on such a step. (Of course, between Falk hearing that interview and now, Grant and Eberstein got married in 2018.) “It can be a very childish idea of, ‘Nope! Marriage isn’t for me!’” Falk says of his characters’ final choice. “But I think there’s a version of it that we came to that allowed Jimmy and Gretchen to erase their fears, erase their trepidations by making the choice not to do that.” Ambitious comedy endings are hard. But You’re the Worst made it look easy. Here is a photo of Chris Geere looking handsome in a tuxedo. FXX I’ve always found it a bit curious that American TV viewers seem willing to embrace ambitious endings when it comes to drama series, while finding them off-putting when it comes to comedy. Whether we’re disgruntled about the Seinfeld gang being made to answer for their dubious crimes or upset about how How I Met Your Mother ultimately met the mother, we really want our sitcoms to end with an indication that all will be well and everyone will be okay. Once again, You’re the Worst figured out how to split the difference. It’s hard to say that “Pancakes” — which leaps across time, after all — isn’t ambitious. But it also leaps across time in service of telling a story about how a group of friends comes back together. It’s ambitious, but in the service of a story that is sneakily romantic at heart. How You’re the Worst chose its closing two songs You’re the Worst ends on two pitch-perfect song choices. The first, The Mountain Goats’ “No Children,” is a song about how love and hate are all wrapped up in each other sometimes, even in the best of relationships. (Sample lyric: “I hope you die. I hope we both die.”) It plays over a montage of snippets of Jimmy and Gretchen’s life together, both happy and sad, between the finale’s two time periods. It’s a very dark song, but it’s also romantic, in a warped way, and it fits Jimmy and Gretchen perfectly. The song that plays over the closing credits is Paul Baribeau’s “Ten Things,” an urgent call from the singer to think about how short life is, and to remember how easy it is to build up regrets. (Sample lyric: “Right now, all you have is time, time, time, but someday that time will run out. That’s the only thing you can be absolutely certain about.”) I love both songs, and I love idiosyncratically dead-on song choices. So I asked Falk about how he landed on them, and he was kind enough to respond via email: My amazing music supervisor Tiffany Anders finds the vast majority of our music, but these two tracks happen to have come from me. I’ve loved The Mountain Goats for a long time and actually helped get John Darnielle to cover our theme “Little Boxes” for Weeds when I worked on that show. We’ve been in casual contact ever since and when I first thought of using “No Children” for our “fill in the three years between the two timelines” montage, I thought it was far too harsh, lyrically. But as I tried other, sweeter songs, I grew to realize not only was the upbeat tone and tempo perfect to help a slow-mo montage have drive, in fact, the lyrics couldn’t have been more perfect. I asked John directly if anyone ever thought of the song as romantic, and he told me, “You would be shocked by how many people have asked me to come play it at their weddings , and who, when I say ‘That would feel weird to me,’ instead just use the recording as their first dance.” So I guess I’m not the only weirdo out there who finds the song romantic. I simply heard “Ten Things” on SiriusXMU, I believe, on my way into work one day during editing and was immediately fascinated by the juxtaposition of the hopeful words and message and the urgency of the music and demolition and violence in Paul Baribeau’s voice. And though, again, I tried other songs for the credits, I kept coming back to that tension that ultimately signifies the possibility of hope amidst ruin. Just like our show! “Sneakily romantic at heart” just might be the best way to describe You’re the Worst in general, too. As Cash puts it, it’s a show about how to negotiate your own happiness within couplehood, whether that means building rules that make sense for just you and your partner, or flouting societal convention altogether. “A relationship is a completely individual experience,” Cash says of Jimmy and Gretchen (but also, really, all relationships). “It’s a contract between two people that is individualized to them, so things you may be not okay with — like for example, sleeping with other people for a week — may be okay in some relationships [as it is for Jimmy and Gretchen]. You just have to find people who are willing to sign the same contract.” There’s no guarantee, of course, that Jimmy and Gretchen will be happy forever. But there’s no guarantee that any couple will be happy forever. The final scene of “Pancakes” — which takes place on the night of the wedding that Jimmy and Gretchen call off in favor of their “choose to love each other every day” gambit — nods to this, in the form of a moment where Gretchen admits that her depression might lead to her someday ending her life. Jimmy sits with that for a moment before darkly cracking that he’ll just get on with his, but it’s clear that in that instant, both of them choose each other again, as they have over and over. “That space in between [those two lines] shows the achievement that both of them have made in that relationship, which is a level of understanding that I don’t think either of them appreciated as much before,” Geere says. The night that I was on set during the filming of the finale was the next-to-last day of shooting on the entire series — Cash would be back the next day for a handful of rudimentary shots of Gretchen opening medicine cabinets and other tiny bits — and the actors were appropriately gutted about their final night of filming. Borges and Donohue had already left when I arrive, so it was just Geere and Cash, dressed in gorgeous wedding finery and looking out over the twinkling lights of Los Angeles, as Jimmy and Gretchen admitted to each other that they don’t know if they can love each other forever, because forever is such a big word. Watching them work together, long before seeing a single frame of the final season, I was struck with melancholy not for the couple — because I was pretty sure they’d be okay — but for You’re the Worst itself, which encountered road bumps along the way but always, always found its way back to the right path, thanks to the two people at its center. “The central thesis of our show is we’re going to present to you the romantic comedy form untouched, but we’re going to highlight the clichés of the genre, not in a way that is satire but in a way that is merely showing the stark differences between the fantasy rom-com of the ‘80s through 2000s and reality, how people really engage in relationships and date,” Falk says. And “Pancakes” finds a way to consider that question anew. What does it mean to love someone? What does it mean to promise yourself to them? What does “forever” even mean, really ? Maybe its willingness to engage with those questions is what allowed You’re the Worst to so ably navigate the “ambitious sitcom finale” conundrum. The show understood that life really does have an epic sweep to it — it unfolds across decades, after all! But if you find the right partner, the right friends, it has an intense, unflinching intimacy. Life is big, and life is small, and “Pancakes” succeeds because it figures out how to be both.

Trump attacks Rep. Ilhan Omar hours after a supporter was charged with threatening to kill her,www.vox.com,Amanda Sakuma,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/4/7/18299172/trump-ilhan-omar-anti-semitism-jewish-republicans,"Flipboard Photo by Ethan Miller/Getty Images President Donald Trump sought to drive a wedge between Jewish voters and the Democratic Party on Saturday by reigniting allegations of anti-Semitism against Rep. Ilhan Omar — just hours after one of his supporters was charged for threatening to kill her. Speaking before the Republican Jewish Coalition’s annual convention in Las Vegas on Saturday, Trump referenced a weeks-old controversy involving Omar , a first-term Democrat from Minnesota and one of the first Muslim women to serve in Congress. In February, Omar alleged on Twitter that pro-Israel sentiment in Washington was being bought by pro-Israel lobbyists. Her remarks prompted politicians from both parties to condemn her remarks, with some labeling them as anti-Semitic. The Congress member later apologized for her tweets. On Saturday, Trump gave Omar a back-handed compliment about the dust-up. “Special thanks to Rep. Omar of Minnesota,” the president said. “Oh, I almost forgot. She doesn’t like Israel ... I’m so sorry!” On the same day that one of his fans was charged with plotting to murder her, President Trump gratuitously attacks Ilhan Omar pic.twitter.com/rPbC7BYNnu — Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) April 6, 2019 Trump delivered his disparaging remarks against Omar just hours after police in New York charged a man for threatening to assault and murder her. Patrick Carlineo Jr., an avowed Trump supporter, was arrested Friday for calling Omar’s office and delivering an expletive-filled rant that included violent threats against the elected official. “Do you work for the Muslim Brotherhood? Why are you working for her, she’s a fucking terrorist? I’ll put a bullet in her fucking skull,” Carlineo allegedly told staffers, according to the criminal complaint filed by the US Attorney’s Office in the Western District of New York. The 55-year-old suspect reportedly later told investigators that he “loves the president and that he hates radical Muslims in our government.” Trump wants to drive a wedge between Democrats and Jewish voters Trump’s speech on Saturday fits into a larger effort by the president to end the support Democrats have had from many Jewish voters for decades. “Democrats are advancing by far the most extreme, anti-Semitic agenda in history,” Trump said Saturday, adding that if implemented, “the Democrats’ radical agenda could very well leave Israel out there all by yourselves.” Trump has also taken to promoting “Jexodus,” a supposed wave of Jewish voters leaving the Democratic Party for the GOP. He has for weeks advanced the idea that Democrats are alienating Jewish voters and that the Democratic Party tolerates anti-Semitism. “Jewish people are leaving the Democratic Party. We saw a lot of anti Israel policies start under the Obama Administration, and it got worsts & worse. There is anti-Semitism in the Democratic Party. They don’t care about Israel or the Jewish people.” Elizabeth Pipko, Jexodus. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 12, 2019 The ‘Jexodus’ movement encourages Jewish people to leave the Democrat Party. Total disrespect! Republicans are waiting with open arms. Remember Jerusalem (U.S. Embassy) and the horrible Iran Nuclear Deal! @OANN @foxandfriends — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 15, 2019 Trump has worked to position himself as a friend of Israel, moving the US embassy to Jerusalem and recently announcing the US will now recognize the contested Golan Heights as a part of Israel . And the Republican Jewish Coalition has an ambitious plan to invest $10 million into efforts to win Trump new Jewish supporters, according to Politico . But as Vox’s Matt Yglesias explained , Jexodus doesn’t really exist. American Jews have a long-standing allegiance to the Democratic Party stretching back to the turn of the 20th century. And while the party does have growing internal divisions over how to address America’s relationship with Israel — the stance taken by Omar and some other progressives contrasts with “the Democratic establishment’s generically pro-Israel view,” as Vox’s Zack Beauchamp notes — it’s worth noting American Jews are hardly universally united on the issue either. So Omar drawing criticism for her tweets doesn’t mean Jewish Democrats will be fleeing the party en masse. That probably won’t stop Republicans from trying to make significant electoral gains with Israel as a driving issue — as evidenced by Trump’s speech Saturday. So far, however, these efforts it has yet to bear fruit. And as Yglesias explains , they may never: While American Jews are largely (though by no means unanimously) supportive of Israel, most do not see political support for Israel to be an adequate substitute for supporting a pluralistic vision of the United States of America, which, after all, is where American Jews live. The contention that Jews should vote Republican because Republicans are stronger backers of the Israeli government isn’t identical to the “dual loyalties” issue that got Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) in trouble earlier this months, but it’s not entirely unrelated either. The reality is that American Jews are Americans, not Israelis, and while elements of GOP social conservatism appeal strongly to Orthodox Jews, for most Jewish Americans, Jewish values and Jewish identity are tied up with openness and pluralism in a way that makes the GOP a very hard sell. Trump himself makes efforts to convert Jewish voters to the GOP even more of an uphill climb. The president has been accused of perpetuating anti-Semitic tropes before (like when he referred to Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) as being “shifty”), and as Schiff noted on Sunday, Trump doesn’t have the greatest track record on forcefully condemning far-right extremism. “If there’s anything that is likely to cement the relationship between the Democratic Party and the Jewish community, it’s the presidency of Donald Trump,” Schiff told CNN’s Jake Tapper on State of the Union .

SNL roasts Joe Biden with sensitivity training on how to ditch his “touchy-feely stuff”,www.vox.com,Amanda Sakuma,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/4/7/18299035/snl-joe-biden-cold-open-sensitivity-training,"Flipboard Saturday Night Live mocked Joe Biden’s apparent penchant for invading women’s personal space with a skit featuring a sensitivity coach who tries to help the former vice president unlearn his “touchy-feely” ways. Former cast member Jason Sudeikis returned to Studio 8H to reprise his role as Biden. The former vice president was in hot water this week after numerous women publicly accused him of touching them inappropriately. Saturday’s cold open sketch kicked off with top Biden advisers plotting how to best confront the former vice president about his interactions with women. If Biden decides to announce a 2020 bid for the Democratic presidential nomination, they point out, he’s going to have to change his behavior. “Joe’s a good guy, and he means well. He’s just a little behind the times,” SNL regular Cecily Strong says, playing a Biden aide, just moments before the Delaware Democrat bursts into the room. Sudeikis’ Biden is a bumbling career politician who remains clueless as to why anyone would take offense to his handsy approach. He immediately makes it clear has no problem conceding he has a habit of cozying up with strangers. “I’m a hugger, I’m a kisser, and I’m a little bit of a sniffer,” Sudeikis says, referencing allegations from Nevada Democrat Lucy Flores , who claimed Biden came up behind her at a 2014 event, put his hands on her shoulders, and leaned in before kissing her on the back of the head. While Sudeikis’ Biden initially defends his behavior, he says he is game for a lesson on how to change his behavior from a sensitivity consultant, played by Kate McKinnon. The coaching session goes off the rails immediately when Biden greets McKinnon by pressing his forehead up against hers for a prolonged embrace. From there, he exasperates her with has a long checklist of habits she tells him are now considered off limits. “No tickling at all,” McKinnon instructs him. “No tickling — even on her birthday,” Biden repeats back. SNL continued to ridicule Biden later in the show when Weekend Update hosts Colin Jost and Michael Che took note of how the allegations against the former veep are hardly a surprise. “He looks like one of those uncles who calls spring ‘sundress time!’” Che jokes. Jost went on to roast Biden’s attempt at an apology earlier in the week. Biden responded to the allegations of impropriety by posting a video on Twitter in which he mimes the different ways in which he enjoys greeting people. Social norms are changing. I understand that, and I’ve heard what these women are saying. Politics to me has always been about making connections, but I will be more mindful about respecting personal space in the future. That’s my responsibility and I will meet it. pic.twitter.com/Ya2mf5ODts — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) April 3, 2019 ”It was supposed to be an apology, not a reenactment,” Jost says. “He might as well end the video by unbuttoning his shirt and saying, ‘To find out what happens next, log on to godaddy.com.’” Next Up In Culture"

Re: Billion is spelled with a ‘B’: Dana Loesch slaps down Kamala Harris’ gun-grabbing logic with Planned Parenthood facts,twitchy.com,boforpresident,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://twitchy.com/jacobb-38/2019/04/07/billion-is-spelled-with-a-b-dana-loesch-slaps-down-kamala-harris-gun-grabbing-logic-with-planned-parenthood-facts/,"Cartoons × Billion is spelled with a ‘B’: Dana Loesch slaps down Kamala Harris’ gun-grabbing logic with Planned Parenthood facts Posted at 4:19 pm on April 7, 2019 by Jacob B.
Kamala Harris apparently thinks her path to the presidency is going out of her way to demonize people who own guns and organizations that protect the right to bear arms.
The horror of choosing candidates who try to uphold the Constitution. For too long, the powerful gun lobby has poured millions of dollars into our elections, hand-picking a Congress to turn a blind eye to gun violence. I say enough is enough. Americans demand smart gun safety laws and deserve action.
Dana Loesch blows Harris’ logic to the sky with a piece from Jonah Goldberg piece at National Review. Planned Parenthood receives half a billion taxpayer dollars a year and turns around to spend millions on Democrat campaigns. Law-abiding gun owners and those in the NRA aren’t even top players https://t.co/0OunFbSxsF https://t.co/N7nfQRP8lg
— Dana Loesch (@DLoesch) April 7, 2019 Trending Was that out loud? Congrats to Matt Yglesias, who just admitted 'in one tweet' how progressives lie about Trump's tax cuts
As the NRO piece points out, the NRA spends very little on getting politicians elected:
Tim Mullaney, a writer for Marketwatch, wrote a richly detailed essay in which he chronicled just how minuscule the NRA’s financial support is — and how small the entire gun industry is — and yet he still concluded it has to be about the money. He writes that “it’s shocking when you realize that it costs only $2,500 per each of the 22,000 or so gun-murder victims of the last election cycle to make Congress cower and refuse to tighten gun rules.” Now do Planned Parenthood https://t.co/eE7dZE09bB
— I Yam What I Yam (@Nvr4Get91101) April 7, 2019
Meanwhile, that’s billion (with a ‘B’) for Planned Parenthood (via Heritage ):
Over a three-year period, Planned Parenthood and its affiliates spent $288 million in federal funds. They also received $1.2 billion in funding from Medicaid, which combines federal and state funds.
That adds up to a whopping total of $1.5 billion in taxpayer funds from federal health programs. How many dollars does the NRA receive from the government? How many dollars does Planned Parenthood receive from the government? Guess who funds the NRA? Individuals who don’t want their right to bear arms infringed upon. Read the constitution, Ms. Heels Up Harris. https://t.co/ZBghAVjEVb"

If you are unfamiliar with the story of Bella Moscato, she is a student in Long Island, New York who chose Donald Trump as the subject of a hero project at school.
She was then forbidden to use Trump and told to select another hero. Sixth-grade student Bella Moscato was given a homework assignment where she was to write about who she considers a hero.
Bella picked Donald Trump.

Bella said the thing that got her angry was the teacher’s hypocrisy:
“The thing I didn’t get, she was ok with somebody doing Barack Obama but not ok with doing Donald Trump? That’s the thing that got me angry. I didn’t like that.”
Former Fox and NBC personality Megyn Kelly expressed her disgust with the story. This is insane. Good for this kid and these parents for standing up for her rights. What is happening to us? https://t.co/wXppXLu608
