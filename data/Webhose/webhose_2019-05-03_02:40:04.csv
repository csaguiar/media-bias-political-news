I blame all 50 states for the Central American invasion --- Texas a little more than most, because they voted for GWB four times (twice for governor and twice for the White House). While Californians were screaming bloody murder about being invaded, Texas was trying to pass off GWB as a conservative and just what the country needed for president."

1) Write your Congressional Reps and Senators, a hard copy letter is far better than an email or fax.
2) Visit their offices and tell them what you think. If they don't hear from you, the voter, they can ignore you pretty easily.
3) And if they unrepentantly ignore their constituents, primary them and vote them out of office. Maybe their own unemployment will make them pay attention."

I never said that. You're just pretending I did because you didn't want to deal with what I did say. So just sit there and pretend that you didn't also say your wall would funnel the illegal aliens to California.

I said they ""HELPED turn California blue."" The feds are responsible for guarding the borders and deporting people --- not Californians. All 50 states vote for President and Congress, and most of them didn't care about all the illegal aliens as long as they didn't go to their state. It's time for you California-bashing cowards to start facing those facts before you turn any more states blue. Texas and Florida alone are 67 electoral votes.

I'm not in charge of saving America. We have a Constitution to tell us what to do. Article 4, Section 4 says that the feds you elect shall keep the states safe from invasion. Quit sending open-borders Rs and Ds to Congress and the White House, and then blaming someone else for what you did."
