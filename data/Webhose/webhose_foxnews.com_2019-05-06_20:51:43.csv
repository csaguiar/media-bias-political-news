Ryan stressed throughout his speech in Youngstown, Ohio, that the U.S. had become split and claimed that there were some politicians who&apos;ve sought “to divide us” and “want to put us in one box or the other.”
“I&apos;m tired of having to choose,” he said. “I want us to come together as a country.”
He pledged that if he captures the presidency, he&apos;ll always consider the public’s problems as his own and “will work every single day” toward improving people&apos;s lives.
“I will tell you that if there is one value that I will bring to the highest office in the land when I wake up, it&apos;s going to be how today can I use every ounce of power that this office has to help ordinary people do something extraordinary today in America.""
Ryan added his candidacy to a crowded field of 2020 Democratic White House contenders during an appearance on “The View” on Thursday .
“I can win western PA, I can win Ohio. I can win Michigan. I can win Wisconsin. And that means Donald Trump is going back to Mar-a-Lago full time,” Ryan said on the show.
He also touted himself as “a progressive who knows how to talk to working-class people.”
Ryan gained national prominence in 2016 when he launched an unsuccessful challenge to unseat Nancy Pelosi as Democratic House leader.

Filming of women's gynecological surgeries draws hospital's apology; lawsuits pending,www.foxnews.com,Paulina Dedaj,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/health/california-hospital-apologizes-after-more-than-80-women-say-they-were-secretly-recorded-during-gynecological-surgeries,"Sharp Grossmont Hospital in La Mesa, Calif., issued a statement Monday apologizing to more than 80 women who are suing the medical facility, saying they were accidentally recorded by motion-activated cameras installed in three separate operating rooms in an effort to catch someone who had been stealing drugs. Hospital officials discovered in 2011 that someone had been taking “powerful drugs” and equipment from anesthesia carts in several operating rooms.
After the hospital was unable to find the thief using “other investigative methods,” officials decided to install a computer monitor with a motion-activated camera in direct view of the anesthesia carts.
“Although the cameras were intended to record only individuals in front of the anesthesia carts, others, including patients and medical personnel in the operating rooms, were at times visible to the cameras and recorded without sound,” the statement read.
Plaintiffs in a class-action lawsuit filed three years ago include one woman who said she was recorded while giving birth by emergency cesarean section.
“The purpose of this investigation was to determine how the anesthesia drugs were going missing in order to ensure patient safety and quality of care,” the hospital’s statement said.
The thief was eventually caught using the hidden cameras and officials said that the individual was no longer affiliated with the hospital.
The hospital said that while it is unable to comment further on the lawsuits, it did say that the videos in question were kept in a “secured safe” and were then provided to third parties as a part of the litigation.
“We sincerely apologize that our efforts may have caused any distress to the women who were recorded, their families, and others we serve.”
Officials said the camera system is no longer in place.

Ram Bahadur Bomjan, a 28-year-old spiritual leader who rose to fame in 2005 amid claims from some believers that he is the reincarnation of Buddha – with crowds gathering to see him meditate in a jungle – is now under investigation after four members of his flock were reported missing.
Police were alerted to the disappearances in late December after receiving complaints from each of the members’ families, who say they have not heard from their relatives in years after they left home to live amongst Bomjan’s followers, according to the Kathmandu Post .
Bomjan previously has been accused of physically and sexually assaulting his followers, with one 18-year-old nun claiming in September last year she was raped, the AFP reports .

Michael Gianaris. “It’s so crazy to at once mock someone for being from a working-class background, for being a bartender, for shaming me for where I was born and where I’m from and on the other hand, when I lean into my identity and who I am and all of that, people are saying that’s not true either.""

“He’s never had to actually see the rising premiums month to month, and you have a $6,000 deductible for a $2,000 health insurance plan,"" she said, according to the paper .

Amazon promised the facility would bring 25,000 jobs to the city. Video
The retail giant pulled out of the deal in February after backlash from some progressives over the $3 billion in tax breaks and subsidies the city was prepared to offer the company.
“[A] small group [of] politicians put their own narrow political interests above their community -- which poll after poll showed overwhelmingly supported bringing Amazon to Long Island City,” Cuomo said in a statement at the time.
Some local residents also blasted the progressives, saying the area needed the Amazon jobs.

“What’s wild to see is how when the community tried to sit down at the table and negotiate … any small demand was immediately met with a ‘no’,” Ocasio-Cortez said. “So it’s not about being blanket ‘pro’ or ‘anti’ Amazon, it’s the fact that … we can’t just be allowed to govern by bullying.”
“People are unhappy, and they should be unhappy with those who were in secret rooms making the deal — not anyone else asking questions and trying to protect the community,” Gianaris added. Trending in Politics"
Reba McEntire on staying away from politics at the 2019 ACM Awards and if she'll ever get married again,www.foxnews.com,Mariah Haas,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/reba-mcentire-on-staying-away-from-politics-at-the-2019-acm-awards-and-if-shell-ever-get-married-again,"Speaking to Fox News, the “Does He Love You” singer revealed that the show, which takes place on Sunday in Las Vegas, needed to be politics-free for her to give the gig a green light . ""When they asked me if I would host the ACMs, I said I will, but I want you to know right now no politics,"" she told us. ""This is not what we&apos;re in here for.""
 ""We&apos;re in here to honor the folks who have worked so hard all year long on their craft and their songs — we&apos;re promoting them,"" McEntire continued. ""Not politics.""
With no politics in sight, McEntire, 64, couldn&apos;t be more excited to return to Las Vegas and helm one of country music&apos;s biggest nights.
""I love the ACM awards because they bring a little bit of Hollywood in with the country,"" she gushed. ""Nashville and Hollywood meet in Las Vegas — and it&apos;s a fun show. Everybody leaves their homes. It&apos;s not in Nashville. It&apos;s not in Los Angeles. We come to Vegas to have a really good time, and Vegas is a wonderful place to have that.
""Everybody gathers in Vegas,"" McEntire, who noted that the city is like her ""second home"" thanks to a residency with Brooks & Dunn , added. ""We rehearse. We&apos;ll go out and have dinner or lunch and just get to hang out — it&apos;s like a family reunion.""
As someone who has won 16 ACM awards, including taking home the coveted Entertainer of the Year honor in 1994, it was not lost on McEntire that there are no female nominees in the top category this year .

""Well, I want more women in there, absolutely!"" the country star said. ""There&apos;s room. There&apos;s great female vocalists who have been working their tails off, and women work really hard not only with the hours they put in to hair and make and up and wardrobe, but they work hard on-stage too, so I think they deserve that recognition.""
For her own part, McEntire recently released a new single titled ""Freedom"" from her upcoming album, ""Stronger Than the Truth,"" out on April 5.
""The first time I heard &apos;Freedom,&apos; I loved it. I thought it was a patriotic song until I really listened to the lyrics,"" she explained. ""It is about a woman who has had a tough time in her love life, and then she finds the love of her life, and she says: &apos;Loving you feels like freedom.&apos; So it&apos;s a love anthem to me.""
Asked if she thinks anything is missing from country music these days , McEntire said that she ""misses story songs.""
""What I&apos;m doing on my album is going back to my roots. It&apos;s stone-cold country,"" the three-time Grammy award-winning singer said of her latest record. ""It&apos;s songs you can dance to whether it&apos;s a slow song or a two-step or story songs. I miss story songs. I love them.
""I mean you can listen to a story song like Dolly Parton and Tom T. Hall, who would sing, and you could see the video in your mind — and I&apos;ve got some of those in my album,"" she continued. ""The album is called &apos;Stronger Than The Truth&apos; and that&apos;s what I was really wanting to get back to on this album to get back to my roots, and that&apos;s what I call country music.""
Aside from music, McEntire has been enjoying spending quality time with boyfriend Anthony ""Skeeter"" Lasuzzo — the pair recently celebrated both of their birthdays with an epic bash in three different cities.

Cosko , 27, include making public restricted personal information, computer fraud, witness tampering and obstruction of justice. In addition to McConnell&apos;s information, Cosko posted the home addresses and phone numbers of GOP Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Mike Lee of Utah and Rand Paul of Kentucky -- as well as then-Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah.
Cosko reportedly became angry about the senators&apos; support for Kavanaugh despite sexual assault allegations that President Trump&apos;s nominee was facing during the hearings. Cosko intended to intimidate the senators and their families, according to court records. Kavanaugh&apos;s nomination was ultimately confirmed.
At the time of his arrest, Cosko was working as an unpaid intern for Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, who fired him soon after. He was previously employed as a computer systems administrator in the office of Sen. Maggie Hassan, D-N.H., a job that gave him ""intimate knowledge of, and broad access to"" the computer systems in Hasan&apos;s office, according to court records. But he had been fired from Hassan’s office in May 2018 for failing to follow office procedures.
After the firing from Hassan&apos;s office, Cosko became angry and repeatedly burglarized the office without being detected, court records said. He copied gigabytes-worth of data, including dozens of user names and passwords belonging to Senate employees and ""contact information for numerous sitting U.S. senators,"" according to court records.
Video Cosko was arrested Oct. 3, 2018, one day after a staffer discovered him working on a computer in Hassan&apos;s office, where Cosko was not authorized to be. Records show Cosko sent a threatening email to the staffer the evening he was confronted.
He is scheduled to be sentenced in Washington on June 13. He could face between two and five years in prison.
Cosko previously held positions with other prominent Democrats , including former Sen. Barbara Boxer of California and the office of Sen. Dianne Feinstein, also of California and the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee.

Indian soldiers patrolled the highway and erected barricades by steel and razor wire at intersections with neighborhood roads in disputed Kashmir to stop any civilian vehicular movement on Sunday.
India&apos;s government issued the order on Wednesday reserving the 270-kilometer (170-mile) stretch of the highway for the exclusive movement of government forces convoys on Sundays and Wednesdays until the end of May.
The order follows a recent suicide bombing of a paramilitary convoy that killed 40 soldiers and brought rivals India and Pakistan to the brink of war."

"Netanyahu, challenger: 2 front-runners in Israel elections",www.foxnews.com,ISABEL DEBRE,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/world/netanyahu-challenger-2-front-runners-in-israel-elections,"The campaigning has heated up ahead of Tuesday&apos;s balloting and Gantz&apos;s Blue and White party has inched ahead of Netanyahu&apos;s Likud in polls. Here&apos;s a closer look at two men vying for the job:
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU: SEEKING TO MAKE HISTORY
If Netanyahu scores a fourth straight term and fifth overall, he will be on track to break the record as Israel&apos;s longest-serving leader. As a fixture of the Israeli political scene for over three decades, ""Bibi"" Netanyahu has become the face of Israel on the world stage.
He has run on his reputation as a seasoned statesman, welcoming a line-up of powerful leaders to Jerusalem just weeks before the election and playing up high-profile photo-ops with everyone from Russian President Putin to his close ally and friend President Donald Trump, who has lavished him with a string of political gifts.
Netanyahu sells himself as the only one who can protect Israel from the rising tide of Iranian aggression and accelerate Israel&apos;s global acceptance, nursing diplomatic relations with former adversaries across the Arab world.
But his rule looks more uncertain than ever after the attorney general&apos;s recommendation to indict him on charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust. Allegations that he manipulated the press through shady deals and accepted lavish gifts from his billionaire friends have thrown his rule into jeopardy.
He has denied all charges, accusing police, prosecutors and the media of orchestrating a political witch hunt to topple him.
Alarmed by the prospect his right-wing bloc could fail to form the next coalition after two former allies joined forces against him, Netanyahu forged an alliance with an extremist faction inspired by the banned Kahanist movement, branded a Jewish terrorist organization by the U.S. for an extremist agenda that includes the forced expulsion of Palestinians.
Although Netanyahu&apos;s controversial political alliance and the corruption allegations have rattled many Israeli voters — and drawn condemnation from American Jews — it hasn&apos;t quite dented his personality cult. He remains admired by his right-wing, populist base.

THE FRESH FACE: BENNY GANTZ, FORMER ARMY CHIEF
Retired army chief Gantz burst onto the political scene just a few months ago, offering himself as an honest alternative to the scandal-plagued Netanyahu and his narrow coalition of ultranationalist and ultra-religious parties.
He joined forces with popular politician Yair Lapid, head of Yesh Atid party, and forged a new centrist party, Blue and White, made up of other former military officers.
The celebrated ex-general may be the only one who can compete with Netanyahu&apos;s own security credentials and gain the trust of a society that feels psychologically and geographically under siege.
Gantz has campaigned on his clean record and military pedigree, proclaiming that Israel has ""lost its way,"" pledging to combat corruption and professing his devotion to state institutions that Netanyahu has assailed.
He has kept his platform vague, however, apparently aiming to reach broad swaths of political moderates. He talks about income inequality, rising home prices and the need for better infrastructure. He criticizes Netanyahu for stoking ethnic and religious tensions, and promises to amend the controversial nation-state law that marginalized minorities by declaring Israel the state of the Jewish people alone.
While trafficking in rhetoric of unity and egalitarianism, Gantz is careful not to come off as too dovish. He isn&apos;t specific about plans for engaging with the Palestinian leadership, wary of alienating political hard-liners. One tough-guy campaign ad bragged about the number of Palestinian militants killed under Gantz&apos;s command in the devastating 2014 Gaza war.
Gantz may be able to exploit Netanyahu&apos;s vulnerabilities, but it remains to be seen whether that&apos;s enough to oust the only leader Israel has known for the past 10 years.

Price also said at the time that both Day and Caswell were “reclusive” and their home was in “very, very poor shape.” He added that Caswell’s memory loss made it difficult to get crucial details for the investigation.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom said Thursday he will travel to El Salvador this month to discuss the poverty and violence that’s causing waves of migrants to seek asylum in the United States. (Associated Press) California Gov. Gavin Newsom will head to El Salvador this month to meet with lawmakers to get to the root cause of why Central American migrants make the arduous journey to the United States. Newsom, a Democrat, will travel to the capital city of San Salvador, just as President Trump and U.S. border officials are calling for tougher security measures amid a spike in Central American migrants attempting to enter the U.S. through Mexico.
CALIFORNIA GOV. NEWSOM OFFERS RARE PRAISE FOR TRUMP
“While the Trump Administration demonizes those who are fleeing violence from Central America, California is committed to lifting up our immigrant communities and understanding the root causes of migration,” Newsom said in a statement. “I am looking forward to traveling to El Salvador in April to talk with the nation’s leaders and activists while deepening the bond between our families and communities.”
California is home to the largest number of El Salvadoran immigrants, Newsom’s office told the Sacramento Bee .
Trump has assailed Central American and Mexican leaders for not doing enough to stop large migrant caravans headed toward the U.S. border. Many of the migrants include children and travel in caravans for protection.

Most are asylum seekers fleeing violence and poverty. Critics of Newsom’s impending trip argue that international travel is the president’s responsibility and that he’s just boosting his anti-Trump credentials, the Desert Sun newspaper in Palm Springs reported.
“I’ve got areas in my district that are flooding,” state Assemblyman Devon Mathis, a Republican, told the paper. “Not in Central America.

A relative of the man was informed about the ordeal by someone in the poaching group and then contacted authorities, according to a news release from police. During a search operation, authorities discovered a human skull and pieces of clothing.
Glenn Phillips, managing executive of the park, warned of the dangers of entering the park illegally.

“Yeah, we’re dating,” she said. “There’s been a lot of speculation about us…but I’m still dating [other people]…We’re not engaged. We’re not married. We’re not boyfriend and girlfriend. We don’t say, ‘I love you.’ We make out. He’s a great kisser,” Bella told Us Weekly .
Bella also told People magazine she wasn’t trying to make their relationship “Instagram official” when she posted a photo of her kissing Chigvintsev’s cheek last month.
“I posted a photo of us because we’re dating and we’re having fun,” Bella said Saturday . “Then everyone went (and said) we were official.”
She insisted she is “not fully taken,” but said dating Chigvintsev has “been great.”

Twenty-one years after 35-year-old Thelma Storrs, left, was found murdered in Lee County, Fla., Luis Nieves, 52 was charged with the homicide after cold case detectives said they recently received a tip in the case. (Lee County Sheriff's Office) Florida cold case detectives say a tip has led to the arrest of a homeless man in the unsolved murder of a woman 21 years ago. Luis Nieves, 52, was booked into the Lee County Jail Friday night on a charge of murder in the death of 35-year-old Thelma Storrs in 1998.

Nieves has four prior arrests for domestic violence in 2007, 2014 and 2016, online court records show. The records show him living at a Fort Myers address at the time of the arrests.
Investigators said Storrs’ body was found in a pasture near Fort Myers on March 17, 1998. She had been reported missing two weeks earlier.
Her fingerprints taken from a prostitution arrest three months before her murder helped authorities identify the body, the Fort Myers News-Press reported at the time.
Friends at that time told the paper Storrs drifted into prostitution after becoming a crack addict.

“When it was — I call it the Red Wedding at &apos;The View,&apos; the day there was like 17 people let go. And then Bill and there was five other producers or something like that. It was a lot of people … I felt so bad for Sherri and Bill, my heart broke for them. But for Bill, to watch someone like that be kind of shoved out the door after creating the show with Barbara the way they did — the way they handled pretty much anyone’s firing was, I think, unprofessional,” she said. ""Terribly unprofessional.""
Part of what made McCarthy so furious was that she alleges that higher-ups at the show and ABC lied to her, telling her she&apos;d remain on the show when they planned on firing her.
Video “Towards the end of the season, I was getting other offers to do shows, so my agent said, ‘Will you let us know if this is working out, because it doesn’t feel like it is, but let us know because we want to take these other jobs,’ and they said, ‘Yeah, she’s fine, we’re going to bring her back, we love her.’ It was all a lie, it was all a lie so we wouldn’t take the next job,” she said.
She added, ""Sherri was also looking at other opportunities. She was renegotiating at the time, so to keep someone — and I even said that to them! I go, ‘I’m a single mother with a special needs kid. Not that that’s a reason to keep anybody, but to keep me away from getting other work when I have other TV offers and I turn them down is really s—ty,’ which I’ve told [them] face-to-face.”
Still, McCarthy wasn&apos;t too heartbroken at her exit. ""I was only there a year,"" she said, ""and I knew it wasn&apos;t the place for me.""

Two Oregon college students have been accused of tricking Apple into giving them thousands of iPhones, which they then sent back to their native China to be sold (iStock) Two Oregon college students have been accused of tricking Apple into giving them nearly $900,000 worth of iPhones, which they then allegedly sent back to China to be sold for profit. Yangyang Zhou and Quan Jiang were both in the United States legally in 2017, while studying engineering at Oregon State University and Linn Benton Community College, when the scam allegedly began. According to documents, the men recieved shipments of counterfeit iPhones from ""an associate"" in China, which they would then submit to Apple for a warranty replacement by claiming that the phones wouldn't turn on.
Apple replaced about half of the phones Jiang submitted claims on, returning 1,493 phones in 2017 and 2018, Oregon Live reports. Jiang then allegedly sent them back to his ""associate"" to be sold at their real value in China. Money profiting from the scheme was then filtered to Jiang's mother, who put the funds into a bank account he could access from the United States.
At about $600 per phone, Apple estimates that the international scheme cost the company $895,800.

The warranty replacement process includes an analysis by an Apple technician to ensure that the phone isn't counterfeit, which they were able to determine in a number of Jiang's phones. However, Apple said that in Jiang's case, many of the phones were replaced because it's not always possible to analyze a phone that won't turn on.
Authorities first became suspicious in April 2017, when Customs and Border Protection confiscated five cellphone shipments from Hong Kong which appeared to be counterfeit. In December of that year, Jiang was being questioned by Homeland Security Investigations agent Thomas Duffy.
In an affidavit, Duffy wrote that Jiang told him he had submitted about 2,000 claims for phone replacements in 2017 alone. However, Jiang maintained that he did not know that the phones he was receiving from China were counterfeit. Zhou is accused of making more than 200 warranty claims to Apple, and discovered three shipments with 95 counterfeit iPhones in his home.
Jiang, who lives in Corvallis, allegedly paid friends and relatives to use their addresses in the surrounding area to receive the shipments from China, in an apparent attempt not to draw attention to his own address.

The wire fraud charge carries the possibility of 20 years in prison, while the trafficking charge could be penalized with up to $2 million and 10 years in prison. He's currently not being held in custody but is being monitored by a GPS.
Zhou stands accused of submitting false information on an export declaration, and is facing up to $10,000 in fines and five years in prison. He also remains out of custody.

“So the leaders of America, who themselves are the creators and supporters of terrorists in the (Middle East) region, will regret this inappropriate and idiotic action.”
Critics warn the decision, which is likely to be announced by the State Department as soon as Monday, could open U.S. military and intelligence officials to similar actions by unfriendly governments around the world.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has advocated the change in U.S. policy as part of the Trump administration’s tough posture toward Tehran, according to Reuters.
Set up after the 1979 Islamic Revolution, the IRGC is Iran’s most powerful security organization and numbers up to 125,000 fighters. It controls portions of the Iranian economy and has a big influence in its political system.

Devin Nunes announces he will send eight criminal referrals to Justice Dept concerning leaks, conspiracy amid Russia probe. California Republican Rep. Devin Nunes says justice will soon come to 'Watergate wannabes.' House Intelligence Committee ranking member Devin Nunes exclusively told Fox News'""Sunday Morning Futures"" that he is preparing to send eight criminal referrals to the Department of Justice this week concerning alleged misconduct from ""Watergate wannabes"" during the Trump-Russia investigation , including the leaks of ""highly classified material"" and conspiracies to lie to Congress and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) court. The dramatic step comes as Republicans have pushed for the release of key documents to uncover the origins of the now-discredited narrative that the Trump campaign colluded improperly with the Russian government. President Trump recently told Fox News he would release the entirety of the FISA applications used to surveil one of his top aides, and other related documents.
Nunes said he has been working on the referrals for more than two years, and wanted to wait until the confirmation of Attorney General Bill Barr.
""We're prepared this week to notify the attorney general that we're prepared to send those referrals over,"" Nunes said. ""First of all, all of these are classified or sensitive. ... Five of them are what I would call straight up referrals -- so just referrals that name someone and name the specific crimes,"" Nunes told Maria Bartiromo. ""Those crimes are lying to Congress, misleading Congress, leaking classified information. So five of them are those types.""
FOX NEWS EXCLUSIVE: INTERNAL FBI TEXTS REVEAL FBI, DOJ SPARRED OVER 'BIAS' IN KEY SOURCE USED TO SURVEIL TRUMP TEAM
It was not immediately clear whom Nunes would specifically refer. Both Democrats and Republicans have said former Trump fixer Michael Cohen is likely to face new charges of lying to Congress in the wake of his recent explosive testimony, which seemed to contradict his previous statements on a variety of matters, including whether he had sought a job in the Trump White House.
The memo pointed out that in December 2017, then FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe testified that “no surveillance warrant would have been sought” from the FISA court “without the Steele dossier information.”
And House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows, R-N.C., touched off a firestorm last August after claiming on Twitter that his office had ""hard evidence"" suggesting the FBI leaked information to the press and used the resulting articles to help obtain surveillance warrants. The claim stemmed in part from FBI intelligence analyst Jonathan Moffa’s Friday testimony behind closed doors before the House Judiciary and Oversight committees.
Nunes added: ""There are three [referrals] that I think are more complicated. ... So on the first one, is FISA abuse and other matters. We believe there was a conspiracy to lie to the FISA court, mislead the FISA court by numerous individuals that all need to be investigated and looked at that, and we believe the [relevant] statute is the conspiracy statute. The second conspiracy one is involving manipulation of intelligence that also could ensnarl many Americans.""
FBI BLAMES 'SYSTEM WIDE SOFTWARE GLITCH' FOR MISSING STRZOK, PAGE TEXTS --- STRZOK'S MUELLER PHONE TOTALLY WIPED
Nunes asserted that ""we've had a lot of concerns with the way intelligence was used"" during the Trump-Russia probe.
Just nine days before the FBI applied for a FISA warrant to surveil Carter Page, then a Trump campaign aide, bureau officials were battling with a senior Justice Department official who had ""continued concerns"" about the ""possible bias"" of a source pivotal to the application, according to internal text messages obtained by Fox News in March.
Redacted versions of FISA documents already released have revealed that the FBI extensively relied on documents produced by Christopher Steele , an anti-Trump British ex-spy working for a firm funded by the Hillary Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee (DNC), to surveil Trump aide Carter Page. The FISA application did not clearly state that the firm was funded by the Clinton team and DNC.

The leaked dossier, and related FBI surveillance, kickstarted a media frenzy on alleged Russia-Trump collusion that ended with a whimper last month, when it was revealed Special Counsel Robert Mueller's probe concluded finding no evidence of such a conspiracy , despite several offers by Russians to help the Trump campaign. Page was never charged with wrongdoing, and he is currently suing the DNC for defamation.
DOJ guidelines preclude the FBI from omitting exculpatory evidence, or misrepresenting sources, in FISA applications. Reports have indicated -- and Republicans have charged -- that the FBI improperly withheld evidence that would have suggested their surveillance targets during the Trump probe were in fact innocent.
FBI INCORRECTLY ASSURED FISA COURT ON FOUR OCCASSIONS THAT YAHOO NEWS ARTICLE WAS INDEPENDENT BASIS TO SPY ON TRUMP AIDE
""The third is what I would call a global leak referral,"" Nunes said. ""So there are about a dozen highly sensitive classified information leaks that were given to only a few reporters over the last two-and-a-half-plus years. So you know, we don't know if there's actually been any leak investigations that have been opened, but we do believe that we've got pretty good information and a pretty good idea of who could be behind these leaks.""
Nunes specifically named a series of known ""horrific"" leaks, including the leak of conversations between Trump and the leaders of Australia and Mexico , and the transcripts of former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn's calls.
Nunes noted that the eight criminal referrals could involve more than eight people, and that a conspiracy referral could involve ""a dozen, two dozen people."" He added that more referrals could be coming.
""I think it's impossible to ignore,"" Nunes said. ""If the Mueller team was busting people for lying to the FBI -- there are some pretty simple times when people lied to Congress for the sole purpose of obstructing our investigation.""

News that the FBI had been secretly monitoring Flynn's communications with Russians broke in January in The Washington Post , and was sourced to anonymous ""U.S. officials."" Flynn met with FBI officials shortly after the publication of that article, and eventually pleaded guilty to one charge of lying to investigators about whether he had spoken to Russia's ambassador concerning an upcoming U.N. resolution on Israel and the Obama administration's sanctions against Russia.
Meanwhile, Donald Trump Jr. told Fox News in January that ""there’s a 99.9 percent chance [House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff is] the guy” who leaked private testimony that he gave in 2017 before the House Intelligence Committee to discuss the Trump Tower meeting with a Russian who offered dirt on Hillary Clinton.
“I came out of testimony 8 at night and CNN is running quotes from noon on about my testimony, you know, in the House Intelligence Committee,” Trump Jr. said. “I mean, that has to say something about what is going on and who they are. Since [Schiff has] never met a camera he didn’t love, I would bet a lot of money that it was him.”
Federal prosecutors have impaneled a grand jury to investigate former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe following the IG's report alleging that McCabe approved a media disclosure to advance his personal interests. McCabe was later fired for lying to investigators and former FBI Director James Comey about the leaks.
And last year, text messages between FBI lovers Peter Strzok and Lisa Page surfaced that referred to government employees ""leaking like mad"" in the runup to the Russia collusion probe.
Strzok and Page exchanged numerous anti-Trump text messages when Strzok was a high-level investigator looking into both Clinton and the Trump campaign. The DOJ Inspector General (IG) found that the texts violated policy and compromised the bureau's appearance of impartiality .

Strzok also assured Page that Trump won't become president, because ""we'll stop"" it.
""The American people have only seen the pieces that have been declassified so far,"" Nunes said. ""There's still more information. This was their insurance policy.

Elizabeth Warren, Kirsten Gillibrand, Bernie Sanders and Beto O’Rourke are all trying to apologize their way to the White House. Sanders has apologized for what an aide called “an entire wave of rotten sexual harassment” in his 2016 campaign.
Gillibrand apologized for doing her job when she was a congresswoman representing a moderate constituency, mainly because a reputation for being moderate is now the leprosy of the Democratic Party. (“I was only focused on the needs of my upstate district. But I really should’ve been focused on the needs of everyone,” she said.)
She also apologized for previously being “callous” about immigration, meaning that she used to be mindful of the political center before she started ranting about abolishing ICE.

Barbara Bush thought Nancy Reagan kicked she and George H.W. Bush when they were down,www.foxnews.com,Jessica Sager,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/barbara-bush-thought-nancy-reagan-kicked-she-and-george-h-w-bush-when-they-were-down,"20 hours ago Last Update 16 hours ago Barbara Bush thought Nancy Reagan kicked her and George H.W. Bush when they were down, book says 'The Matriarch' reveals details on the late first lady Barbara Bush Former first ladies Barbara Bush and Nancy Reagan 's feud came to a head when Bill Clinton was inaugurated in 1993, according to the author of a new book. Susan Page said in her book “The Matriarch” that Bush and Reagan's acrimony reached a fever pitch after Reagan called into ABC News' live television coverage of Clinton's inauguration to slam reports of how she treated the Bush family.
“The Bushes were aghast,” Page wrote (via People). “At the low point of their political lives, Nancy Reagan had made one more petty dig.”
GEORGE H.W. BUSH AND BARBARA BUSH THROUGH THE YEARS
Reagan had claimed she tried calling Barbara Bush previously but could not reach her. After Reagan's comments went public, Barbara “reluctantly” accepted a call from the fellow former first lady.
“She [Mrs. Reagan] started out by saying that she knew that this was a hard time with packing boxes and all ... but ... and here I interrupted her and said that all was well,” Barbara recalled to Page. “I told her that our friends and family had given us such a good welcome home and that they had pretty much unpacked for us, [but] that the thing that made it tough was having her say all those ugly things about me on the air.”

BARBARA BUSH DIDN'T CONSIDER HERSELF A REPUBLICAN WHEN SHE DIED
Bush added, “She said that she was just trying to explain. I asked her not to explain about me anymore ... she had hurt me badly and I just could not understand it.”
According to a New York Times report at the time, Reagan “had been desperately trying to call Barbara Walters, an old friend, to privately correct something Ms. Walters had said on the air. ... But somehow, Mrs. Reagan was connected to Peter Jennings on the air ... While Mr. Jennings and David Brinkley sat by, bemused, Mrs. Reagan unloaded on both her successors.”
REMEMBERING BARBARA BUSH
Reagan also claimed that the Bushes had never invited her or former president Ronald to a state dinner, even though Barbara Bush clarified that she'd invited the couple just 10 days earlier to present the Medal of Freedom to Ronald Reagan. “We did have your wonderful husband to the White House,” Barbara Bush recalled telling Reagan, “and don’t you ever call me again!” Video
Of course, if Barbara and then-President George H.W. Bush didn't invite the Reagans over, it may have been simply returning the favor: Nancy Reagan notoriously left the Bushes out of their own celebrations , even while they served in office together.
When Nancy Reagan died in 2016 , Barbara Bush said in a statement, “Nancy Reagan was totally devoted to President Reagan, and we take comfort that they will be reunited once more.” However, in her diary ahead of George H.W. Bush's inauguration, Page claimed Barbara Bush wrote, “I will not treat her [incoming second lady Marilyn Quayle] as Nancy Reagan has treated me.”
Barbara Bush passed away in April 2018. When she and George H.W. Bush were asked why the Reagans didn't like them, George replied simply, “I don't know.” On Our Radar "
Hart family friend 'can't imagine' deliberate killings before deadly plunge off California cliff,www.foxnews.com,Katherine Lam,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/us/hart-family-friend-cant-imagine-deliberate-killings-before-deadly-plunge-off-california-cliff,"Riannah Weaver told People magazine that she and others who know the Hart couple questioned whether they really knew their former friends who appeared as a close-knit family dubbed the “Hart Tribe.” A jury ruled Thursday that Jennifer and Sarah Hart deliberately killed themselves and their six children — Markis, 19, Hannah, 16, Abigail, 14, Devonte, 15, Jeremiah, 14, and Sierra, 12 — by driving their SUV off a 100-foot cliff in Mendocino County, about 180 miles north of San Francisco. “Since the beginning of this, and when it first happened, there have been those of us who basically questioned our own sanity,” Weaver told the magazine . “We also questioned, like, how did we not see this if that’s what happened?”
A special coroner's jury in Mendocino County determined the the March 2018 deaths were murder-suicide. (AP)
Weaver met the family in 2010 at a fundraiser and said the Hart family “were always together and very wonderful and very approachable. They were just magical.”
The family, however, had been battling abuse allegations in multiple states for years and may have succumbed to a lot of pressure, Mendocino County Sheriff&apos;s Lt. Shannon Barney said Thursday. The family of eight also gained nationwide attention after one of their sons, Devonte Hart, was photographed with tears streaming down his eyes while hugging a police officer during a 2014 protest in Portland, Ore.
""Just a lot of stuff going on in their lives, to the point where they made this conscious decision to end their lives this way and take their children&apos;s lives,” Barney said.
Family of 8 likely dead after SUV plunges off cliff Weaver said Friday that it’s possible the couple made the decision to kill their children and themselves.
“It’s always been this thing that we’ve discussed, like a lot of us [who knew them] discussed that maybe we didn’t know them at all,” Weaver said. “So there’s the possibility that Jen and Sarah had made that decision.”
“But I still can’t imagine them taking the kids on purpose,” she added.
Sarah Hart searched suicide, drowning, Benadryl dosages and overdose methods on the internet throughout the drive to California, California Highway Patrol investigator Jake Slates said. She also queried whether death by drowning would be painful. Authorities recovered the deleted searches from her phone.
A jury ruled the Sarah and Jennifer Hart and their six adopted children died in a murder-suicide. (AP)
Jennifer Hart, who drove the vehicle off the cliff, was “drinking to build up her courage.” She had a blood alcohol level well over the legal limit while her wife, Sarah, had 42 doses of generic Benadryl in her system. The children also had high amounts of the drug in their bodies.
""They both decided that this was going to be the end,"" Slates said. ""That if they can&apos;t have their kids that nobody was going to have those kids.""
The bodies of siblings Markis, Jeremiah and Abigail were found the same day near the car. Weeks later, the body of Sierra Hart was pulled from the Pacific Ocean. Human remains found in a shoe were matched to Hannah Hart through DNA testing.
Devonte Hart’s body was never located, though he’s been presumed dead.

"Schiff refuses to back down on claims against Trump, says he has no regrets",www.foxnews.com,Andrew O'Reilly,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/schiff-refuses-to-back-down-on-claims-against-trump-says-he-has-no-regrets,"GOP calls for Adam Schiff to resign as House Intelligence Committee chairman Rep. Adam Schiff , D-Calif., blasted Republicans calling him to step down from his post as chair of the House Intelligence Committee for his repeated claims of collusion between President Trump’s 2016 campaign and Russian operatives. Schiff on Sunday refused to back down from his claims that the evidence of wrongdoing by Trump “is in plain sight” and said he has no regrets calling out the president for what he believes is “deeply unethical and improper conduct.”
“I think there is a different standard here between the Republicans and the Democrats,” Schiff said during an interview on CNN’s “State of the Union.”“The Republicans seem to think that as long as you can't prove it's a crime, all is fair in love and war...I don't feel that way, I don't think most Americans feel that way.”
ADAM SCHIFF REJECTS REPORTS MUELLER INDICTMENTS ARE OVER, SAYS SPECIAL COUNSEL COULD BE CALLED TO TESTIFY
For two years, Schiff routinely sounded ominous warnings about what Special Counsel Robert Mueller might find on Trump.
In March 2017, Schiff told MSNBC that ""there is more than circumstantial evidence now"" of a relationship between Russia and Trump's associates. In December of that year, Schiff said on CNN: ""The Russians offered help, the campaign accepted help. The Russians gave help and the president made full use of that help. That is pretty damning, whether it is proof beyond a reasonable doubt of conspiracy or not."" Video
And in May of last year, Schiff said on ABC that the Russian hacking of Democratic National Committee emails is ""like Watergate in the sense that you had a break in at the Democratic headquarters, in this case a virtual one, not a physical break in, and you had a president as part of a cover up."" Schiff said later that the Russia investigation is ""a size and scope probably beyond Watergate.""
Despite Schiff’s claims, Mueller found no evidence of coordination or conspiracy involving Trump, his campaign and the Russian government, Attorney General William Barr wrote in a letter released late last month. "
Rosie O'Donnell and Whoopi Goldberg made 'The View' into 'World War III',www.foxnews.com,Jessica Sager,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/rosie-odonnell-and-whoopi-goldberg-made-the-view-into-world-war-iii,"Ramin Setoodeh, author of ""Ladies Who Punch: The Explosive Inside Story of &apos;The View&apos;"" described a power clash between the two panelists as the root of their beef. “I don’t think she liked to be challenged,” Setoodeh told Jenny McCarthy of Goldberg. “I think she had the most problems with Rosie O’Donnell because Rosie wanted to challenge her and wanted to change the show. Rosie felt like Whoopi was kind of checked out.”
When the women were together, Setoodeh said , ""It was World War III. It was the worst &apos;The View&apos; had ever been when the two of them were on. They were fighting every single day. It got so bad that Rosie would be backstage complaining to guests about how mean Whoopi was to her.""
Setoodeh also claimed that O&apos;Donnell told him her own doctor told her she was having a ""health crisis"" on the show when he saw her neck artery throbbing during an argument with Goldberg. O&apos;Donnell claimed to have walked off the set into the audience during a commercial break to take a Xanax because Goldberg cut her off and made her upset.
Video O&apos;Donnell reportedly was especially furious that Goldberg wouldn&apos;t let the panel speak Bill Cosby on the show because he was a friend of Goldberg&apos;s and ""for a long time didn&apos;t believe the women who came forward."" Both O&apos;Donnell and McCarthy alleged that Goldberg didn&apos;t let them debate or argue and would just cut to a commercial during a disagreement.
Setoodeh said that O&apos;Donnell, who&apos;d hosted her own hit daytime talk show previously, ""was used to being in charge. She was used to calling all the shots, and &apos;The View&apos; wasn&apos;t her show. It was Barbara Walters&apos; show, and when she came back the second time, Whoopi was really in charge because she was the moderator. And she sort of made life Hell for everyone because she was so frustrated all the time because things weren&apos;t going her way.""
Still, Setoodeh says of O&apos;Donnell, her motives weren&apos;t malicious: She was a perfectionist and wanted to make the show better, while the rest of the panel reportedly didn&apos;t want to rock the boat.
""She was very honest about it. She didn&apos;t think that they were doing a good enough job,"" Setoodeh said, admitting that she may have had ""unrealistic expectations ... She had a lot of trouble letting other people do things.""

Jury to decide if deadly fire in bunker tunnels was a crime,www.foxnews.com,MICHAEL KUNZELMAN,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/us/jury-to-decide-if-deadly-fire-in-bunker-tunnels-was-a-crime,"Fire investigators swiftly concluded that the Maryland home was a crime scene, a deadly end to a wealthy stock trader&apos;s campaign to build an underground bunker for protection from a nuclear attack. Daniel Beckwitt, a 27-year-old millionaire who grew up in the house, was charged with second-degree murder and involuntary manslaughter in the September 2017 death of Askia Khafra. When Beckwitt&apos;s trial starts this week, his attorneys likely will try to persuade jurors that Khafra&apos;s death was a tragic accident. Beckwitt risked his own safety in a failed attempt to rescue his friend from the blaze, his lawyers have said.
Jury selection for Beckwitt&apos;s trial is scheduled to start Monday in a Montgomery County courtroom. And a judge recently ruled that jurors can hear testimony about evidence that investigators found in the fire-gutted house in Bethesda, a suburb of Washington, D.C.
Beckwitt&apos;s lawyers argued that investigators conducted illegal, warrantless searches of the home and later secured a search warrant based on misleading information. A police affidavit falsely suggested the fire had been deliberately set by someone who provided investigators with inconsistent information about the cause of the fire, defense attorneys said.
Prosecutors said investigators properly obtained and executed the search warrant under difficult circumstances, including the extreme hoarding conditions inside the home. Piles of trash and debris covered most of the floors and reached the ceiling in spots, hindering the search for evidence.
Montgomery County Circuit Court Judge Cheryl McCally last month denied defense lawyers&apos; request to suppress all the evidence seized from the home. The judge said the ""unique circumstances"" of the search justify the weeks it took for investigators to complete it.
Investigators found Khafra&apos;s body in the basement, where a hole in the concrete floor led to a shaft that dropped down 20 feet (6 meters) into tunnels that branched out roughly 200 feet (60 meters) in length. The tunnels had lights, an air circulation system and a heater powered by a ""haphazard daisy chain"" of power strips that created a fire risk, Montgomery County prosecutor Douglas Wink said during a hearing last year.
Hours before the fire, Khafra texted Beckwitt to warn him it smelled like smoke in the tunnels. Beckwitt flipped a breaker that turned off lights in the tunnels but turned the power back on after Khafra said he couldn&apos;t see, Wink said, accusing Beckwitt of ignoring ""obvious signs"" of danger.
Beckwitt told a detective he and Khafra were close friends and business partners. He said he had invested $6,000 in a business venture of Khafra&apos;s after meeting him online. In exchange, Khafra agreed to help Beckwitt dig his tunnels.
Khafra&apos;s parents filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Beckwitt on the anniversary of the Sept. 10, 2017, fire. His father, Dia Khafra, said during an interview last year that he and his wife tried to persuade their son to stay away from Beckwitt&apos;s tunnels.
""I always feared something dangerous would happen to him,"" Dia Khafra said.
Beckwitt went to extraordinary lengths to maintain his project&apos;s secrecy. He tried to trick Khafra into thinking they were digging the tunnels in Virginia instead of Maryland. Beckwitt told investigators he would pick Khafra up in a rental car and drive him to Manassas, Virginia, where he had the younger man don ""blackout glasses"" before driving him around for about an hour, according to a police report.
Khafra worked in the tunnels for days at a time, sleeping there and urinating and defecating into a bucket Beckwitt lowered into the tunnels. Khafra had a cellphone, but Beckwitt used internet ""spoofing"" to make it appear he was in Virginia, according to Wink.
The prosecutor described Beckwitt as a skilled computer hacker who had a paranoid fixation on a possible nuclear attack by North Korea.
When he was a student at the University of Illinois, campus police arrested him in 2013 on charges including computer fraud. He was suspected of installing keystroke logging devices on the Urbana school&apos;s computers. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to two years of probation, according to online court records.
In 2016, after he moved back to Maryland, Beckwitt spoke at a hacker convention using the alias ""3AlarmLampscooter"" and wearing a fire-resistant suit and visor that obscured his face. Wink said Beckwitt was teaching his audience how to make thermite bombs to destroy computer data ""in order to get away with hacking."" Defense attorney Robert Bonsib has said Beckwitt&apos;s use of a pseudonym and disguise was harmless, typical of the ""weird things"" people do on the internet.
Beckwitt&apos;s lawyers say he screamed for help from his neighbors after the fire broke out and tried to save Khafra from the fire, but heavy smoke and flames forced him to retreat. ""Beckwitt made repeated efforts to locate Khafra and expressed concern for his friend and put his own safety at risk seeking (to) find and rescue his friend — efforts noted in the reports of the Fire and Rescue personnel who were on the scene,"" they wrote.

Reebok slams reports Beyoncé walked out on meeting over alleged lack of diversity,www.foxnews.com,Jessica Sager,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/reebok-slams-reports-beyonce-walked-out-on-meeting-over-alleged-lack-of-diversity,"After reports surfaced that Beyoncé walked out of a meeting with Reebok over a supposed lack of diversity, the sneaker brand spoked out and vehemently denied the allegations. While it&apos;s not clear where the Reebok rumors originated, the tall tale was perpetuated on ESPN &apos;s ""The Jump.""
ESPN reporter Nick DePaula said on the show that diversity was incredible important to Queen Bey, quipping, ""I had heard a great story about how throughout this process over the last year or two, she&apos;d discussed with Under Armour, with Reebok as well, Jordan at one point was interested in being partnered with her.""
He continued, ""She had a meeting at Reebok and they had a whole presentation of everything, potential products, how this could all look, and she kind of took a step back and said, &apos;Is the team that would be working on my product?&apos; And somebody said yes, and she said, &apos;Nobody in this room reflects my background, my skin color and where I&apos;m from and what I want to do.&apos; And she kind of took a step back and left, and they did not come to terms.""
Reebok slammed the report this weekend.
""The report that Beyoncé walked out of a meeting with Reebok due to lack of diversity is categorically false,"" the athletic brand told TMZ in a statement. ""Our discussions with Beyoncé and her team continued for several months after our initial meeting. We are disappointed that false information is being reported as fact.""
Last week, it was revealed that the 37-year-old Grammy winner will relaunch her Ivy Park line with Adidas, saying in a statement, “This is the partnership of a lifetime for me.

US pulls forces from Libya due to 'security conditions' amid fighting near capital,www.foxnews.com,Travis Fedschun,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/world/us-pulls-forces-from-libya-due-to-security-conditions-amid-fighting-near-capital,"U.S. Africa Command said in a news release that a contingent of U.S. forces supporting U.S. Africa Command has pulled out due to ""security conditions on the ground."" “The security realities on the ground in Libya are growing increasingly complex and unpredictable,” said U.S. Marine Corps Gen. Thomas Waldhauser, the head of U.S. Africa Command. “Even with an adjustment of the force, we will continue to remain agile in support of existing U.S. strategy.”
Waldhauser did not provide details on the number of U.S. troops that have been withdrawn or on how many remain inside the country. Photos and videos posted to Twitter appear to show some of the U.S. troops evacuating near Tripoli.
Officials have told Fox News that hundreds of American troops had been in Libya in recent years helping the U.N.-backed government combat Islamic State and Al Qaeda militants.
Troops also protect diplomatic facilities in the wake of the deadly 2012 attack on a U.S. diplomatic compound and CIA annex in Benghazi , Libya, that killed 4 Americans, including Ambassador Chris Stevens.

Fighting was underway Sunday at the international airport about 15 miles from central Tripoli, after the Libyan National Army, led by Field Marshal Khalifa Hifter, claimed to have seized the area. The airport was destroyed in a previous bout of militia fighting in 2014. Hifter said his forces had launched airstrikes targeting rival militias on the outskirts of Tripoli.
Libya has been gripped by unrest since the 2011 uprising that overthrew and killed long-ruling dictator Muammar Qaddafi, and in recent years has been governed by rival authorities in the east and in Tripoli, in the west, each backed by various armed groups.
A senior State Department official told Fox News that the Trump administration has made clear its ""deep concern"" about fighting near Tripoli, adding there is ""no military solution"" to the Libya conflcit.
""The United States opposes the military offensive by Khalifa Haftar’s forces and urges the immediate halt to all military operations against Tripoli, and return to status quo positions,"" the official told Fox News. ""All involved parties should urgently de-escalate the situation, which is endangering civilians and undermining prospects for a better future for all Libyans.""

The rival militias, which are affiliated with a U.N.-backed government in Tripoli, said they had also carried out airstrikes that slowed Hifter&apos;s advance. At least 23 people, including civilians, have been killed on both sides since Thursday.
The Interior Ministry of the Tripoli-based government said in a statement to the Associated Press that at least 9 people, including a physician, were killed. It said at least 55 fighters and a civilian were wounded.
Ahmed al-Mesmari, a spokesman for Hifter&apos;s forces, said Saturday that 14 troops had been killed since the offensive began.
The fighting has displaced hundreds of people, the U.N. migration agency said. The U.N. mission to Libya has called for a two-hour cease-fire on Sunday in parts of Tripoli to evacuate civilians and wounded people.
The LNA is supported by Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, France and Russia. It answers to the authorities based in eastern Libya, who are at odds with the U.N.-backed government.

In this Friday, April 5, 2019, photo, police tape marks the area where the Spartanburg County Sheriff's Office and Spartanburg County Coroner's were working after two bodies were found buried on the property on Williams Street in Spartanburg, S.C. Two men have been charged with murder in connection with the discovery. (Tim Kimzey/Spartanburg Herald-Journal via AP) SPARTANBURG, S.C. – Two South Carolina men have been charged with murder after sheriff's deputies found two bodies buried at a house just outside Spartanburg, authorities said. The arrests came after one of the suspects shot himself in the head in front of deputies, survived, and subsequently told deputies he'd witnessed the other man kill his girlfriend.
Arrested Saturday were 39-year-old Jonathan Galligan and 41-year-old Christian Daniel Hurlburt, local news outlets report.
Deputies say that on Friday, they found buried the bodies of 27-year-old Christin Renee Bunner of Spartanburg and 40-year-old Melissa Fairlee Rhymer of Mountville. Galligan is charged with Bunner's death, while Hurlburt is charged with killing Rhymer.
Both men are jailed without bail following a Saturday hearing. It's unclear if they have lawyers who could comment for them.
Officers were called to a local towing service Wednesday concerning a disturbance. Hurlburt, who lives on the property, wouldn't follow deputies' commands, took out a gun and shot himself in the head. Wounded, he called deputies to his hospital bed Thursday and told them about Bunner's death, saying he helped bury the woman in the yard at Galligan's house. Hurlburt later confessed that he'd killed a second woman and buried her at the house, where Galligan lived at one time.
Deputies couldn't find the bodies Thursday, but returned with cadaver dogs Friday. Authorities said the remains were found in graves that began about 18 inches (46 centimeters) below the ground.
""The dogs indicated in two areas,"" said Spartanburg County Coroner Rusty Clevenger. ""We went to those two areas and were able to find human remains. They are of two people.""
They interviewed Galligan on Friday, but released him after he demanded an attorney and asked to leave, said sheriff's spokesman Lt. Kevin Bobo.
But later that day, the sheriff announced deputies were seeking to arrest Galligan. He was taken into custody Saturday at a convenience store. Hurlburt was taken to jail Saturday after he was released from the hospital. Both men are also charged with being accessories after the fact. Hurlburt is also charged with being a convicted felon in illegal possession of a gun.
Bunner had been missing since December and deputies say Galligan was her boyfriend.
""This man took my daughter,"" said Renee Bunner, Christin Bunner's mother, at the bail hearing. ""She has been missing since December the 16th. Not only did he murder her, but he also tried to bury her.""
Deputies say Hurlburt told them he killed the second woman at the towing company in January, but said he didn't remember her name. She was identified as Rhymer using fingerprints. Rhymer had not been reported missing to local law enforcement agencies.
Investigators said they don't believe any more bodies are buried at the house. Trending in US"
Burger King slammed on social media over ad featuring chopsticks: 'It's racist',www.foxnews.com,Alexandra Deabler,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/burger-king-slammed-on-social-media-over-chopsticks-ad-its-racist,"The ad, which aired in New Zealand, featured several fast-food customers attempting – and failing – to eat the chain&apos;s new Vietnamese Sweet Chili Tendercrisp chicken sandwich using giant chopsticks. On social media, the ad was accompanied by a caption reading, “Take your taste buds all the way to Ho Chi Minh City with our Vietnamese Sweet Chili Tendercrisp, part of our Tastes of the World range. Available for a limited time only."" ""We are truly sorry that the ad has appeared insensitive to our community,"" said James Woodbridge, Burger King New Zealand&apos;s general manager of marketing, in a statement to The New Zealand Herald . ""We have removed it and it certainly does not reflect our brand values around diversity and inclusion,"" he said.
In an earlier statement to Fox News, a spokesperson for Burger King said, ""The ad in question is insensitive and does not reflect our brand values regarding diversity and inclusion. We have asked our franchisee in New Zealand to remove the ad immediately.”
Backlash over the ad began bubbling up on social media earlier this month, following a viral tweet that called out the commercial for trying to joke about customers having difficulty using chopsticks.
""So this is the new Burger King ad for a &apos;Vietnamese&apos; burger,"" wrote Maria Mo, a Korean New Zealander, along with a video of the commercial. Mo then added a sarcastic, ""OK, coolcoolcool, chopsticks r HILARIOUS right omg etc.""
Soon after Mo posted the video, it went viral, pulling in over 2 million views as of Sunday afternoon, and garnering hundreds of comments from Twitter users expressing their own outrage at the company’s approval of the ad.
Mo told HuffPost she decided to post the video because she was shocked to see it in the first place.
“Because I couldn’t believe such blatantly ignorant ads are still happening in 2019, it honestly took me a second to work out what the heck I was looking at,” Mo told HuffPost in a message.
“[People of color] are constantly having to deal with microaggressions as well as outright hatred and it just never ends,” she added.
According to the New Zealand Herald, the ad had only been appearing on social media since March, after having been pulled from television by the Advertising Standards Authority for a different reason altogether: ""Enticing people to overeat.""
The ad will now reportedly be scrapped altogether.
This is not the first time brands have been called out for being culturally insensitive when using chopsticks in marketing campaigns.
In November, Dolce & Gabbana apologized after receiving backlash for a series of “racist” ads that used an Asian model using chopsticks to eat pizza and other Italian foods.
In 2017, the New York Times came under fire for its inappropriate positioning of chopsticks in a photograph announcing the yet-to-be opened “Asian-inspired” steak house, Jade Sixty. Twitter pointed out the chopsticks were placed in an upright manner — a chopsticks etiquette faux pas in Japanese culture , as upright chopsticks indicate death or suggest a funeral offering. The New York Times replaced the photo to one without chopsticks.

Chicago prosecutor Kim Foxx defends Jussie Smollett decision,www.foxnews.com,Jessica Sager,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/chicago-prosecutor-kim-foxx-defends-jussie-smollett-decision,"""I have been asking myself for the last two weeks what is this really about,"" Foxx said at the Rev. Jesse Jackson Sr.&apos;s Rainbow Push Coalition on Saturday. ""As someone who has lived in this city [Chicago], who came up in the projects of this city to serve as the first African American woman in this role, it is disheartening to me ... that when we get in these positions somehow the goalposts change."" She also said she&apos;d run for re-election when her current term is complete.
Foxx reportedly mentioned in her speech that she welcomes an independent investigation into her handling of the case, saying that nearly 6,000 other ""low-level defendants"" received the same treatment with deferred prosecution, adding that under the law, Smollett could&apos;ve been fined a maximum of $10,000 — which he effectively paid when he forfeited his bond for the same amount.
Video Foxx recused herself from Smollett&apos;s case after communicating with one of his relatives during the police investigation into whether or not the musician and actor staged an alleged hate crime against himself. Her office later said she never actually formally recused herself from the case.
Smollett&apos;s attorney said that his case was not one of deferred prosecution when she announced that the charges against him had been dropped.
In January, Smollett told police that two masked men attacked him, put a rope around his neck and poured bleach on him as he was walking home from a Subway restaurant. The actor, who is black and openly gay, said the masked men beat him, made racist and homophobic comments and yelled, "" This is MAGA country "" before fleeing the scene.
However, the Chicago Police Department alleged that Smollett paid the two men, Abel and Ola Osundairo , by check for a ""phony attack"" in order to take ""advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career."" The brothers were allegedly caught on surveillance footage purchasing the rope used in the staged ""attack"" on Smollett.
Video The ""Sum of my Music"" singer was later arrested for allegedly filing a false police report and released on a $10,000 bond . Smollett pleaded not guilty to 16 counts of disorderly conduct stemming from the alleged hoax. All charges against Smollett were dropped in late March in a move that legal experts claimed was ""almost unheard of.""
Still, the star isn&apos;t entirely out of the woods yet: The FBI is investigating whether Smollett sent himself a threatening hate letter to the ""Empire"" set, which could potentially land him behind bars for a decade for mail fraud — a federal offense.
Smollett has maintained his innocence throughout the ordeal. His attorneys previously told Fox News they&apos;ve ""witnessed an organized law enforcement spectacle that has no place in the American legal system. The presumption of innocence, a bedrock in the search for justice, was trampled upon at the expense of Mr. Smollett and notably, on the eve of a Mayoral election. Mr. Smollett is a young man of impeccable character and integrity who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence betrayed by a system that apparently wants to skip due process and proceed directly to sentencing.”

Fisher-Price issues warning about Rock 'N Play Sleeper after 10 infant deaths,www.foxnews.com,Anna Hopkins,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/health/fisher-price-issues-warning-about-rock-n-play-sleeper-after-10-infant-deaths,"The New York-based company, which makes educational and functional products for infants and toddlers, said in a statement on Friday that children older than 3 months who have learned how to roll over should not use the Rock &apos;N Play. The children who died in the sleeper were older than 3 months and, while unrestrained, managed to roll on their stomachs or sides before they died, BuzzFeed News reports. The deaths first began occuring in 2015, and took place as recently as last month. The Rock &apos;N Play is a top seller on Amazon and advertises itself for infant naps and overnight sleep, and comes with a vibration setting to comfort children.
“Fisher-Price warns consumers to stop using the product when infants can roll over, but the reported deaths show that some consumers are still using the product when infants are capable of rolling and without using the three point harness restraint,” Fisher-Price said in a statement.
The company said in a statement on Friday that children older than three months who have learned how to roll over should not use the Rock 'N Play (Fisher Price)
If the Consumer Product Safety Commission is forced to move forward with a full recall, they will do so, a spokesperson said. The company, however, maintains that the sleeper still meets international safety standards and that the safety instructions warn parents whose children can sit or pull themselves up on their own not to use the product.
Chuck Scothon, a general manager at Fisher-Price, told CNN that any child&apos;s death is an ""unimaginable tragedy,"" and that the company will continue working to ensure the complete safety of its products.
""Fisher-Price and every one of our employees take the responsibility of being part of your family seriously, and we are committed to earning that trust every day,"" he said.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom said Thursday he will travel to El Salvador this month to discuss the poverty and violence that’s causing waves of migrants to seek asylum in the United States. (Associated Press) California Gov. Gavin Newsom will head to El Salvador this month to meet with lawmakers to get to the root cause of why Central American migrants make the arduous journey to the United States. Newsom, a Democrat, will travel to the capital city of San Salvador, just as President Trump and U.S. border officials are calling for tougher security measures amid a spike in Central American migrants attempting to enter the U.S. through Mexico.
CALIFORNIA GOV. NEWSOM OFFERS RARE PRAISE FOR TRUMP
“While the Trump Administration demonizes those who are fleeing violence from Central America, California is committed to lifting up our immigrant communities and understanding the root causes of migration,” Newsom said in a statement. “I am looking forward to traveling to El Salvador in April to talk with the nation’s leaders and activists while deepening the bond between our families and communities.”
California is home to the largest number of El Salvadoran immigrants, Newsom’s office told the Sacramento Bee .
Trump has assailed Central American and Mexican leaders for not doing enough to stop large migrant caravans headed toward the U.S. border. Many of the migrants include children and travel in caravans for protection.
LOS ANGELES OFFICIALLY DECLARES ITSELF A ‘CITY OF SANCTUARY’
Most are asylum seekers fleeing violence and poverty. Critics of Newsom’s impending trip argue that international travel is the president’s responsibility and that he’s just boosting his anti-Trump credentials, the Desert Sun newspaper in Palm Springs reported.
“I’ve got areas in my district that are flooding,” state Assemblyman Devon Mathis, a Republican, told the paper. “Not in Central America. Come see the central San Joaquin Valley. … Come down to where we have Third World conditions.” “I’ve got areas in my district that are flooding. Not in Central America.

El Salvador has one of the highest murder rates in the world, due in part, to gangs like MS-13, which was started by Salvadoran immigrants in the U.S. and spread to El Salvador and other countries.

May makes last-ditch Brexit effort with Labour as clock ticks down,www.foxnews.com,Christopher Carbone,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/world/may-defends-approaching-labour-on-brexit-deal-as-clock-ticks-down,"Despite the prime minister&apos;s best efforts to persuade lawmakers to back her European Union divorce deal, it has now been rejected in the House of Commons three times. May said that ""there is no sign it can be passed in the near future."" May defended her decision to reach across the ideological divide on Saturday, saying there was a ""stark choice"" of either leaving the European Union with a deal or not leaving at all.
Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom said the Tories were working with Labour ""through gritted teeth,"" telling the BBC that no deal would be better than canceling Brexit.
British lawmakers are now trying to craft a proposal that will break the deadlock ahead of an emergency EU summit on Wednesday.
""We have no choice but to reach out across the House of Commons,"" May said, insisting the two main parties agree on the need to protect jobs and end free movement. ""The referendum was not fought along party lines and people I speak to on the doorstep tell me they expect their politicians to work together when the national interest demands it.""
But leading Conservative Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg on Sunday slammed May&apos;s move to include Labour in the Brexit talks and blamed her for failing to take Britain out of the EU already.

Another Conservative lawmaker, Nigel Evans, said that if May failed to deliver Brexit and all she could do was secure a long extension at an EU summit on Wednesday, she would face massive pressure to step down.
“At the moment there is focus on delivering Brexit, but if a long delay becomes a reality I believe the noises off about removing the prime minister will become a cacophony,” Evans told The Guardian . “I and many other Conservatives would prefer leaving the EU on World Trade Organization terms to any humiliating long extension that forces us to take part in the European elections.”
According to The Guardian, May is offering to enshrine in law a plan that would give parliament a say in future trade talks with the EU, which they believe would stop a future Tory leader from shifting to a more hardline Brexit stance once May is no longer the prime minister.
Other sticking points, such as whether Britain would remain in a customs union or the possibility of having a second referendum, are reportedly concessions that May has left the door open to making.
Most outside observers and mainstream economists believe that if Britain were to leave the EU with no deal, it would wreak economic havoc for the country and could even lead to shortages of basic goods and medicine.

Giuliani slams leaks from Mueller team about Barr's handling of obstruction of justice,www.foxnews.com,Andrew O'Reilly,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/giuliani-slams-leaks-from-mueller-team-about-barrs-handling-of-obstruction-of-justice,"Giuliani, who told Fox News’ Howard Kurtz on “MediaBuzz” that he would like to see the Mueller report released in its entirety, slammed The New York Times’ sources for saying there were concerns raised by some members of Mueller’s team that the report was more damning of Trump than Barr has publicly indicated. “That leak really indicates all you need to know about Mueller’s prosecutors,” Giuliani said on the Times’ unnamed sources. “Leaking like that…that’s been the biggest canard in this investigation.”
Giuliani’s comments come just days after The New York Times reported on the upset among some Mueller staffers over Barr’s handling of the report – particularly the attorney general’s four-page summary that noted there was no evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, and Barr’s decision not to proceed with obstruction of justice charges against Trump. Mueller’s decision to skip prosecutorial judgment “leaves it to the attorney general to determine whether the conduct described in the report constitutes a crime,” Barr wrote.
Video The newspaper’s sources did not explain why some in Mueller’s team thought the findings were more damaging to Trump than Barr has revealed, but the report is expected to outline the president’s attempts to thwart the investigation.
“There is nothing wrong with the newspaper, there is something wrong with the prosecutor,” Giuliani said. “This tells me they don’t have anything, because if they were malicious enough to do that and they had a smoking gun, they wouldn’t say in general it’s very damaging.”
Video Barr has faced criticism since penning his letter that he unduly sanitized the full report in Trump&apos;s favor, including on the key question of whether the president obstructed justice. House Democrats on Wednesday approved subpoenas for
Mueller&apos;s entire report and any exhibits and other underlying evidence that the Justice Department might withhold.
In a statement on Thursday, Barr defended the decision to release a brief summary letter two days after receiving the report on March 22. He has previously said he did not believe it would be in the public&apos;s interest to release the full document in piecemeal or gradual fashion, and that he did not intend for his letter summarizing Mueller&apos;s ""principal conclusions"" to be an ""exhaustive recounting"" of the special counsel&apos;s investigation.
Video Barr is now expected to release the entire report, with redactions, by mid-April.
""Given the extraordinary public interest in the matter, the Attorney General decided to release the report&apos;s bottom-line findings and his conclusions immediately — without attempting to summarize the report — with the understanding that the report itself would be released after the redaction process,"" the Justice Department statement said.

It&apos;s a solid start for ""Pet Sematary,"" though far from the haul that the last big-screen adaptation of King&apos;s conjured up: ""It"" opened with $123.4 million in 2017.
Last week&apos;s top film, "" Dumbo ,"" slid steeply in its second week. Landing in third, the Disney live-action remake dropped 60 percent with $18.2 million.
Pitched as ""&apos;Big&apos; meets Superman,&apos;"" ""Shazam!"" stars Asher Angel as Billy Batson, a teenage foster kid who transforms into an adult superhero (played by Zachary Levi ).
Video Jeff Goldstein, distribution chief at Warner Bros., said the studio originally forecast a $40 million opening. ""That was the right number for us,"" Goldstein said. ""That&apos;s what we needed to make money on it.""
But expectations grew based on reviews (91 percent fresh on Rotten Tomatoes) and audience reaction (an ""A&apos;&apos; Cinemascore). The PG-13-rated film attracted an especially young crowd; 45 percent were under 25.
The result further validated DC&apos;s pivot following the disappointments of Zack Snyder&apos;s "" Batman v Superman "" and David Ayer&apos;s "" Suicide Squad ."" Warner Bros. has since steered its comic book adaptions in a different direction, leaning more on stand-alone entries less predicated on the overall ""universe"" and more fluctuating in tone.
Earlier in the week, Warner Bros. also teased the DC release ""Joker,"" with Joaquin Phoenix, at CinemaCon. An even smaller-budgeted origin story with a similarly unique, albeit much darker, tone; it was one of the most talked-about movies at the Las Vegas event.
""&apos; Wonder Woman &apos; was really the start of changing the ship,"" Goldstein said. ""When you look at each of these properties, they&apos;re all very different. Their approach is different. Their tone is different. But here&apos;s the commonality: All good movies, all well done. I think that&apos;s what you&apos;ll see out of DC is very specific approaches for that property.""
Video Overseas, ""Shazam!"" grossed $102 million in 79 markets, including $30.9 million in China.
""DC has really found its groove,"" said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for Comscore. ""They&apos;re really breaking out each character. Shazam and the Joker could not two more different characters within the DC Universe. But I think that diversity of content is going to serve them well.""
Dergarabedian noted the two most dominant genres in movies right now — superheroes and horror — swamped theaters, taking up four of the top five spots at the box office. The stiff competition in similar-styled holdovers could have slightly depressed results for both ""Shazam!"" and ""Pet Sematary."" But right now, there is little room on the calendar between major comic book films and horror releases.
In fourth was Jordan Peele&apos;s horror thriller ""Us,"" which added $13.8 million in its third week. Its cumulative global total stands at $216.6 million.
Video Marvel&apos;s Brie Larson-led ""Captain Marvel,"" which recently crossed $1 billion in worldwide ticket sales , took in $12.7 million domestically in its fifth weekend. Captain Marvel, ironically, was Shazam&apos;s original name when the character was first crafted, as a Superman knockoff, in 1939. He was relaunched in 1973 as Shazam after decades of lawsuits and the debut of Marvel&apos;s own Captain Marvel.
The weekend&apos;s other wide-release newcomer was STX Entertainment&apos;s ""Best of Enemies,"" starring Taraji P. Henson as a civil rights activist and Sam Rockwell as a Ku Klux Klan leader. It opened with $4.5 million.
In limited release, Claire Denis&apos; ""High Life,"" starring Robert Pattinson, opened with about $100,000 in four theaters for A24.
Neon&apos;s Aretha Franklin documentary, ""Amazing Grace,"" debuted with $96,000 in eight locations. The film, shot over two days at the New Bethel Baptist Church in the Watts section of Los Angeles in 1972, was lost for decades in part because its director, Sydney Pollack, failed to slate the images, leaving them not synced with the audio. Before her death last August , Franklin sued several times to prevent its release.
Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. Where available, the latest international numbers for Friday through Sunday are also included.
1. ""Shazam!"" $53.4 million ($102 million international).
2. ""Pet Sematary,"" $25 million.
3. ""Dumbo,"" $18.2 million.
4. ""Us,"" $13.8 million.
5. ""Captain Marvel,"" $12.7 million.
6. ""The Best of Enemies,"" $4.5 million.
7. ""Five Feet Apart,"" $3.7 million.
8. ""Unplanned,"" $3.2 million.
9. ""Wonder Park,"" $2 million.
10. ""How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World,"" $2 million.

(AP Photo/Giannis Papanikos) DIAVATA, Greece – The last 60 holdouts from among nearly 1,000 migrants who fought with Greek police for three days have left their makeshift camp in northern Greece. The migrants clashed with police because they believed false reports on social media that restrictions on travel to central and northern Europe had been lifted.
Police detained a few of the 60 who had no valid papers. The rest left either for migrant camps or apartments across Greece. None of the residents of a nearby official camp were among them.
Even as the makeshift camp started emptying late Saturday, a group was heard cheering loudly. Asked why, they said Chancellor Angela Merkel was opening Germany's borders. Like the previous reports, this one also was false.
Most of the migrants are refugees from Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan. Trending in World"
