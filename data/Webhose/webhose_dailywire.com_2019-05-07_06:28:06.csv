"Now Cancer-Free, Colorado Senator Announces Bid For President | Daily Wire",www.dailywire.com,Kassy Dillon,05-02-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46675/now-cancer-free-colorado-senator-announces-bid-kassy-dillon,"Now Cancer-Free, Colorado Senator Announces Bid For President ""I plan to run for president."" Zach Gibson/Getty Images May 2, 2019 views After initially delaying his presidential campaign announcement due to a cancer diagnosis, Sen. Michael Bennet (D-CO) formally announced he is running on Thursday morning. “I plan to run for president,” Bennet said in an interview on CBS This Morning. While writing a book about American politics, Bennet said he “became convinced in that process that if we continue to go down the path, we’re going … to be the first generation of Americans to leave less opportunity, not more to the next generation.”
“I just need to do everything I can do to make sure we don’t do that,” he said. Bennet explained that he believes partisan politics has been an issue in the U.S. before President Trump, but that “he has certainly made matters worse.” ""If we keep going down this road, we’re going to be the first generation of Americans to leave less opportunity, not more."" -- @SenatorBennet https://t.co/X7ass6bczO pic.twitter.com/6IhnFxjnVo — CBS This Morning (@CBSThisMorning) May 2, 2019 Bennet, 54, was diagnosed with prostate cancer last month but said a recent surgery successfully removed the cancer, NPR reports.​ Bennet made his intentions to run clear in other recent interviews but said his diagnosis was an obstacle.
""The idea was to announce sometime in April,"" Bennet said in an interview with the Colorado Independent . ""That was the plan. We hired some staff. We interviewed people for positions in New Hampshire and Iowa. And then I went for the physical. In my last physical, my PSA was high. They did a biopsy, and it was clear. But this time, it was not clear.""​ ""I'm looking forward to running in 2020,"" Bennet said on CNN’s “State of the Union” with Jake Tapper a week after being diagnosed. ""This obviously was unexpected. But we caught it early. It's something that I think we're going to be able to treat. And I don't think it should keep me off the trail.""​ In Bennet’s first tweet about his presidential bid, he explained he is running because “we cannot be the first generation to leave less to our kids, not more.” “That’s why I’m running for President. Let’s build opportunity for every American and restore integrity to our government,” he added. We cannot be the first generation to leave less to our kids, not more. That’s why I’m running for President. Let’s build opportunity for every American and restore integrity to our government. — Michael Bennet (@MichaelBennet) May 2, 2019 Bennet graduated from Wesleyan University and Yale Law School. After serving in the private sector, Bennet was selected to be the superintendent of Denver Public Schools in 2005. In 2009 he was selected by Colorado Gov. Bill Ritter to fill a vacated seat in the U.S. Senate. In 2010 he successfully won a campaign for a full term in the Senate and in 2016 won a reelection campaign. Bennet is the 21st Democrat to join the presidential race in hopes of securing the Democratic nomination. His brother, James Bennet, who is an editorial page editor for The New York Times, will recuse himself from 2020 election coverage. In a statement, the Times said James Bennet “will not discuss, assign or edit any editorials, Op-Eds, columns or other Opinion pieces focused on candidates or major issues in the campaign.” “As long as Sen. Bennet’s campaign is active, responsibility for all political coverage will be handled by the deputy editorial page editors, Kathleen Kingsbury and James Dao,” the Times added. “Even prior to the announcement, James has not been involved in any editorial decisions related to the senator.” . @nytimes editorial page editor James Bennet has recused himself from 2020 election coverage following the announcement that his brother Senator Michael Bennet intends to run for president.

James Comey: 'It's Sad I Have To Flee The Country In This Stupid Egyptian Goatherd Disguise.' [Satire] | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Andrew Klavan,05-02-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46694/james-comey-its-sad-i-have-flee-country-stupid-andrew-klavan,"The following is satirical.
Top officials are deeply upset about Attorney General Bill Barr’s announcement that he is investigating the reasons the FBI spied on Donald Trump’s campaign.
In a statement made while he was pasting on a fake beard and disguising himself as an Egyptian goatherd, former FBI Director James Comey said, “It is a very sad day for this nation when I have to leave town as quickly as possible in this ridiculous getup. I can’t believe that anyone could doubt the righteousness of the most righteous person this universe has produced since Paul Scofield in A Man for all Seasons , and you can’t get any more righteous than he was, believe you me.” Mr. Comey than excused himself, climbed out the bathroom window and has not been seen since.
In a statement delivered to the bottom of a table in O’Malley’s bar in Chappaqua, Hillary Clinton vehemently denied any collusion with the Russians, saying, “Yes, I paid a foreign national to gather Russian disinformation on Donald Trump and yes I passed that completely false disinformation to the FBI and yes they used that totally invented slander to get a warrant to spy on the Trump campaign but the crucial element of intent was not there. Just ask James Comey, if you can ever find him.”
Former CIA Director John Brennan, in an impassioned speech delivered from a car speeding toward the Canadian border, said, “I am so aggrieved by this odious calumny that I have decided to change my name and live in an undisclosed location until the heat’s off. You’ll never take me alive, John Law.”

CNN: Trump’s Economic Approval Rating ‘The Highest Number We’ve Ever Seen’ For His Administration | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Ashe Schow,05-02-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46691/cnn-trumps-economic-approval-rating-highest-number-ashe-schow,"May 2, 2019 views
While discussing President Donald Trump’s recent polling numbers, a CNN analyst made a startling exclamation.
When the topic of the president’s approval rating on the economy came up, CNN’s David Chalian said Trump’s 56% approval was “the highest number we’ve ever seen at CNN polling.” Chalian was making the claim in reference to only Trump, saying a few seconds later, “It’s the high watermark in the entirety of the Trump presidency in CNN polling.”
Indeed, it is the highest approval rating on the economy that Trump has received during his presidency from CNN, but it is not the highest approval rating CNN has ever seen.
Former President Barack Obama, for example, beat that number twice during his eight years as president — in the first months of his presidency in 2009 and as he was leaving office in 2017. Both of these numbers should be looked at with a grain of salt. He entered office with high hopes. Remember, he had won the Nobel Peace Prize for a speech he gave before he was inaugurated. His approval rating on the economy jumped eight points from before the 2016 election to just before Trump was inaugurated, so one can also assume that might have had more to do with apathy over Trump than anything Obama had actually accomplished.
Trump is now in his third year as president. At this same point in Obama’s presidency, his approval rating for the economy was just 42%. So on that, at least according to CNN polling , Trump has him beat.
Other polls, however, have not been so kind to Trump. Real Clear Politics averaged Obama’s approval rating on the economy at 57%, which is far higher than CNN’s average.
Newsweek reported in March that former President Bill Clinton’s economic approval rating blows everyone else out of the water:
While Trump’s economy rating essentially matched Obama’s, they both paled in comparison to President Bill Clinton’s, who had the record economic approval rating of 81 percent in 1999. The record low rating since Gallup began polling on the economy, at the start of President Ronald Reagan’s term, was 17 percent for President George H. W. Bush in 1992. Trump’s latest rating is well above the average rating of 43 percent. Trump’s economic approval rating never dipped below 45 percent.
CNN further reported that Trump’s high economic approval rating comes after the economy performed better than expected during the first quarter, growing 3.2% compared to the expected 2.5%. (CNN conveniently left those numbers out of its report on Trump’s economic approval rating.)
Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, said at a recent conference in Los Angeles that Trump’s handling of the economy would help him win re-election in 2020.
""You hate to sound like a cliché, but are you better off than you were four years ago? It's pretty simple, right? It's the economy, stupid. I think that's easy. People will vote for somebody they don't like if they think it's good for them,"" Mulvaney said."
"WATCH: Dem Rep. Steve Cohen Eats KFC, Carries Chicken Statue In Hearing To Mock 'Chicken' AG William Barr | Daily Wire",www.dailywire.com,Emily Zanotti,05-02-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46709/watch-dem-rep-steve-cohen-eats-kfc-carries-chicken-emily-zanotti,"Cohen did not keep all the chicken for himself. He did offer drumsticks to a couple of female aides seated in front of him.
Later, at an impromptu press conference, Cohen brandished the plastic chicken for reporters, explaining that: “Chicken Barr should have shown up today and answered questions … this man was picked to be Donald Trump’s fixer. The black socks look clean compared to this team. It's a sad day in America.”
Cohen eventually put the chicken down behind AG William Barr's name placard at the congressional witness table for a photo opportunity. It’s official... a plastic chicken where a U.S. Attorney General should be. #ChickenBarr pic.twitter.com/CHfoaiPSvo — Trish Zornio (@trish_zornio) May 2, 2019
Thanks to Cohen's efforts, ""#ChickenBarr"" began trending on Twitter, as progressive social media activists caught on to the joke.
Other legislators, including Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-NY), who called the hearing, chose to leave their mark on Barr in other ways. Nadler gave a speech to Barr's empty chair (sans plastic chicken), berating him for failing to appear and connecting Barr's decision not to testify to further, secretive Trump administration policies.
Barr said Wednesday that he would not attend the House hearings on Thursday after a dispute with Democrats over whether committee staff members and outside legal counsel, rather than legislators themselves, should be allowed to question the acting Attorney General, according to CNN . The Attorney General's office also refused to turn over a full, unredacted version of the Mueller report to Nadler and other Democratic legislators, despite a subpoena.
Nadler has said repeatedly that he will not be satisfied until he obtains a full, clean version of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report and a copy of the evidence Mueller used to come to the conclusion that President Donald Trump and the 2016 Trump presidential campaign did not collude with Russian officials to alter the outcome of the 2016 presidential election.
On Wednesday, Barr spent hours in front of a Senate committee where, instead of being questioned on the content of Mueller's report, he was repeatedly interrogated over a letter, issued in early April, describing the contents of Mueller's report as clearing the president of collusion charges. Democrats were focused on how Barr characterized the report, despite having actual copies of the report in hand.
Nadler did promise retribution for Barr's absence, telling reporters ominously that House Democrats ""will have no choice but to move quickly to hold the attorney general in contempt if he stalls or fails to negotiate in good faith. If he does not provide this committee with the information it demands and the respect it deserves, Mr. Barr’s moment of accountability will come soon enough.”"
"KNOWLES: Sorry, AOC, Bernie, Nordic Countries Are Not Socialist | Daily Wire",www.dailywire.com,Daily Wire,05-02-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46677/knowles-sorry-aoc-bernie-nordic-countries-are-not-daily-wire,"KNOWLES: Sorry, AOC, Bernie, Nordic Countries Are Not Socialist Yana Paskova/Bloomberg via Getty Images May 2, 2019 views
On Thursday’s episode of “The Michael Knowles Show,” the host debunks the talking points claiming that Nordic countries are socialist and that the United States should model their countries after their example. Transcript and video below.
Bernie, AOC, they want to tell you that the socialism that they're pushing is like the Nordic countries. It's not like Venezuela. Not a lie. The Nordic countries have relatively free economies, and they have no minimum wage. None of those countries have a minimum wage.
Sweden has a universal school choice, a far more free-market approach to education than even the United States has. Iceland has a freer economy than the United States, according to the Heritage Foundation index for economic freedom.
If AOC wants to be more like Iceland, then she ought to support freeing up the economy, not increased socialism. The former Danish Prime Minister Lars Rasmussen puts the point very clearly. He says, ""Denmark is far from a socialist planned economy. Denmark is a market economy.""
But what AOC and Bernie Sanders are pushing is a socialist planned economy. And it's so disingenuous if you hear Bernie Sanders or AOC talk about this. Bernie Sanders didn't have his honeymoon in Denmark, and he didn't go on his honeymoon to Iceland. He went on his honeymoon in 1988, the day after he got married, to the Soviet Union. In fact, I'm sorry to say we have video of this Bernie Sanders shirtless drinking vodka singing commie songs with the Russkies in the Soviet Union in 1988.
Bernie Sanders was so enthralled with the Soviet Union, with Soviet communism, the most repressive regime on Earth, and one of the most repressive regimes in the history of the world, that he took his honeymoon there. He didn't want to go to Scandinavia, he wanted to go there, worse even than Venezuela. And to remind you that he's not pushing policies that would bring us to Iceland, and he's pushing the policies of Latin America — just three years earlier in 1985, Bernie Sanders was defending socialist breadlines in Latin America.
Bernie Sanders: ""It's funny sometimes American journalists talk about how bad a country is because people are lining up for food. That's a good thing. In other countries, people don't line up for food. The rich get the food and the poor starve to death.""
Bernie says, ""bread lines are a good thing, in a lot of countries the rich get food and the poor starve to death."" Right, in socialist countries that's what happens. That's what's happening in Venezuela right now. And if they don't starve to death, they get run over by tanks. That doesn't happen in the United States. Nobody starves to death in the United States. The biggest problem afflicting the poor in the United States is obesity. The problem among the poor in the United States is that they're eating too much — that's not what happens in socialist countries. They starve to death while the rich and the well-connected and the cronies all benefit. "
Poynter Removes Unreliable List Of ‘Unreliable News Websites’ | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Ashe Schow,05-03-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46736/poynter-removes-unreliable-list-unreliable-news-ashe-schow,"Poynter Removes Unreliable List Of ‘Unreliable News Websites’ Nipitphon Na Chiangmai / EyeEm / Getty Images
Ouch, that’s embarrassing.
On Tuesday, the Poynter Institute published a list of allegedly “unreliable” news websites. The list included nearly every conservative media outlet and virtually no liberal media outlets. Within a day of publication, Poynter had to issue a correction and removed two websites from the list. Following more complaints, the organization has now removed the list entirely.
In a “ letter from the editor ” published Thursday, Poynter’s managing editor Barbara Allen apologized for the list, acknowledging that it was itself unreliable.
Allen first explained how the list was created, which consisted of other lists created by biased “journalists” and “fact-checkers,” such as Snopes and Politifact. The intention of the list was to help others – such as advertisers – boycott allegedly “unreliable” news websites by allowing them “to gauge the legitimacy of the information they were consuming.”
As Allen notes, it was not just websites on the list that complained, but also “readers who objected to the inclusion of certain sites, and the exclusion of others.” Poynter then decided to “audit” the list (as opposed to doing this before publication) and “found weaknesses in the methodology.” The organization “detected inconsistencies” between the original lists and their “own rendering” of the final version.
“Therefore, we are removing this unreliable sites list until we are able to provide our audience a more consistent and rigorous set of criteria. The list was intended to be a starting place for readers and journalists to learn more about the veracity of websites that purported to offer news; it was not intended to be definitive or all encompassing,” Allen wrote. “We regret that we failed to ensure that the data was rigorous before publication, and apologize for the confusion and agitation caused by its publication. We pledge to continue to hold ourselves to the highest standards.”
Poynter had already published a correction to the list shortly after it was put online, removing my former employer The Washington Examiner and Indian outlet FirstPost from the list.
“This index previously listed The Washington Examiner and FirstPost as unreliable news sources. After reviewing our methodology, we found that neither met the criteria for inclusion, so both were removed,” the correction read.
Read Allen’s full statement below:
Dear readers:
On Tuesday, April 30, Poynter posted a list of 515 “unreliable” news websites, built from pre-existing databases compiled by journalists, fact-checkers and researchers around the country. Our aim was to provide a useful tool for readers to gauge the legitimacy of the information they were consuming.
Soon after we published, we received complaints from those on the list and readers who objected to the inclusion of certain sites, and the exclusion of others. We began an audit to test the accuracy and veracity of the list, and while we feel that many of the sites did have a track record of publishing unreliable information, our review found weaknesses in the methodology. We detected inconsistencies between the findings of the original databases that were the sources for the list and our own rendering of the final report.
Therefore, we are removing this unreliable sites list until we are able to provide our audience a more consistent and rigorous set of criteria. The list was intended to be a starting place for readers and journalists to learn more about the veracity of websites that purported to offer news; it was not intended to be definitive or all encompassing. We regret that we failed to ensure that the data was rigorous before publication, and apologize for the confusion and agitation caused by its publication. We pledge to continue to hold ourselves to the highest standards.

Woman Who Married Herself: It Was The Best Day Of My Life | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Hank Berrien,05-03-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46742/woman-who-married-herself-it-was-best-day-my-life-hank-berrien,"May 3, 2019 views
Writing in The Telegraph, a 42-year-old British woman chortled that the best day of her life came last June — the day she married herself .
Melissa Denton, a two-time divorcee with two children, writes, “The idea to marry myself came to me in January last year, when I was at work one day. Three weeks before, on Christmas Eve, I had received a text message from my boyfriend of five and a half years: ‘I can’t do this any more, it’s over,’ it said … It was devastating and left me in a funk, unable to eat, sleep or smile.”
Seizing upon the idea of marrying herself, Denton recalls a TV interview with Sophie Tanner, who had married herself in May 2015. Denton writes, “I was so down, and knew that I needed to learn to love myself before I would be able to attract the right people into my life. For years, I had poured myself into relationship after relationship, losing myself in the process. It was time to put ‘me’ first - a way to affirm that I can be happy on my own and to move on from the relationship.”
Denton bought a ring and set the wedding date. She admits her colleagues thought she was crazy, but she had previously shaved her head to raise money for a cancer charity and later dyed her hair pink and wore a nose ring.
Denton writes that her children, Ruby, 15, and Jasper, 11, were initially skeptical but came around, as did her family, but her brother did not bring his son to the wedding because he thought it would confuse him. She writes, “I’m hoping his opinion has now changed.”
Denton’s mother was initially against the idea, but Denton notes, “She soon came around. At the end of the day, she told me she was really proud.”
The wedding featured “a DJ, live band, karaoke and a huge vegan feast.”
Denton writes, “For the first time in my adult life, I was single and happy - the experience was empowering. Rather than wasting my time, energy and love on someone else, I was putting myself first.""
Denton explains, “My potted and relentless history with men started at 16, when my father died in a car accident.” She segues to her two failed marriages, then adds, “Relationships only got more difficult from there, as I bounced from one man to the next with little time in between to heal or become independent. I often transferred emotions from my last relationship into the next, all the way until that awful Christmas Eve text. “
She describes the wedding: “The atmosphere at the wedding was amazing, and everyone was celebrating, including a couple of ex-boyfriends and some former in-laws. It was just like any other wedding - just without a groom. I walked down the aisle, in a pink dress, with a big smile - towards no-one. A friend gave me away and another officiated. I repeated the vows and put the ring on myself, and we passed a paper plate around the 130-person congregation for everyone to sign in lieu of a register, as it’s not a legal procedure. It was the best day of my life.”
Denton concludes that now that she is fulfilled, she is “ready for a new challenge – and to start cheating on myself – so I applied to go on First Dates. I didn’t consider that for some people it might be a bit too mad. Instead, I planned to joke that I was married, but a bit bored.”
She’s committed to the idea of marrying herself, though: “Some people don’t understand it – but to me, it made absolute sense and that’s why I’m going to renew my vows at a similar ceremony every year, even if I am in a relationship. I have even bought four wedding dresses that can be used in the future. It is a way to centre and value myself, as well as remember that I can receive love that is equal, not one-sided. “
And there’s this: “Being Mrs Denton has taught me to be happy in my own company and skin, to not put pressure on myself to look or act in a certain way. Confidence is the most attractive thing a person can have and the marriage has given me that. My marriage to myself might not have come with a wedding night or honeymoon, but the plans for the future are far more exciting.” Recommended For You"
CA Senate Votes To Keep Trump Off Primary Ballot Unless He Releases Tax Returns | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Hank Berrien,05-03-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46750/ca-senate-votes-keep-trump-primary-ballot-unless-hank-berrien,"CA Senate Votes To Keep Trump Off Primary Ballot Unless He Releases Tax Returns Photo by Tim Boyle/Getty Images May 3, 2019 views
On Thursday, the California state Senate took a shot at President Trump, passing a bill that would require presidential candidates to release five years' worth of income tax returns or not appear on the primary ballot.
As AP reported , a similar bill was passed in 2017, but Gov. Jerry Brown, who himself would not release his tax returns while in office, vetoed the bill, claiming it was unconstitutional. Brown stated , ""Today we require tax returns, but what would be next? Five years of health records? A certified birth certificate? High school report cards? And will these requirements vary depending on which political party is in power?""
But new California Governor Gavin Newsom may well sign the bill, which is coauthored by state Sen. Mike McGuire and state Sen. Scott Wiener, who authored the 2017 bill.
In 2017, McGuire stated, ""For decades, every president has put their personal beliefs aside and put our country first and released their returns. The American people shouldn’t be in the dark about their president’s financial entanglements."" Wiener added, ""This bill is about giving the American people the honesty and transparency they deserve from anyone who wishes to serve as their president.”
This week, McGuire stated, “We believe that President Trump, if he truly doesn’t have anything to hide, should step up and release his tax returns.” He said recently , “President Trump’s refusal to release his income tax returns has broken a time-honored, bipartisan tradition which has weakened our democracy and his jaw dropping business conflicts have now put the security of our nation at risk.”
Last December , McGuire ranted, “Voters not only deserve full disclosure of their leader’s tax returns, they should be entitled to them. If President Trump had released his tax returns we would know why he’s ignoring intelligence agencies and snuggling up to the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, who has been linked to the brutal killing of Jamal Khashoggi. Transparency is a nonpartisan issue and it’s time to put the speculation to bed and bring to light any conflicts of interest that could drive an American president into the arms of a foreign power. It’s time to make President Trump’s tax returns public.”
Newsom spokesman Brian Ferguson said the bill “would be evaluated on its own merits.”
McGuire noted that Newsom has released his tax returns, adding, “I never want to put words into his mouth, but here’s what I’ll say: Gov. Newsom has led by example.” He said, “We can all debate on the floor about the constitutionality of this bill. But we also have to look at what makes our democracy strong. The foundation of any successful government is transparency.”
AP wrote, “Candidates would have to submit tax returns to the secretary of state’s office, which would work with the candidates to redact some information before posting the returns online.”
Similar bills have been proposed in New Jersey and Washington state.
According to a Morning Consult poll in April, a bare majority of respondents, 51%, want to see Trump’s tax returns released."
WALSH: Why Facebook's War On ‘Hate’ Is Just A Thin Excuse To Censor Conservatives | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Matt Walsh,05-03-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46743/walsh-why-facebooks-war-hate-just-thin-excuse-matt-walsh,"May 3, 2019 views
Without giving a warning or any specific reason, Facebook purged a number of "" far-right extremists "" from its platform this week. Paul Joseph Watson, Milo Yiannopolous, Alex Jones, and Laura Loomer were all summarily banished. Louis Farrakhan was also given the boot — though he is not, despite media claims, in any way ""far-right.""
This ban reaches farther than anything we've yet seen. Facebook and Instagram will neither allow links to their content nor mentions of any events they attend. According to the The Atlantic , the only Infowars content permitted on either platform is that which expressly condemns Infowars:
Infowars is subject to the strictest ban. Facebook and Instagram will remove any content containing Infowars videos, radio segments, or articles (unless the post is explicitly condemning the content), and Facebook will also remove any groups set up to share Infowars content and events promoting any of the banned extremist figures, according to a company spokesperson. (Twitter, YouTube, and Apple have also banned Jones and Infowars.)
The social media conglomerate offered only vague justifications for this move. It claimed that the targeted people are guilty of ""hate"" and ""violence,"" and are therefore ""dangerous."" As for evidence of this dangerous hate and violence, it gave only a few rather bizarre examples. From the BBC :
It said Alex Jones had hosted on his programme Gavin McInnes, leader of the Proud Boys, whose members are known for racist, anti-Muslim and misogynistic rhetoric. Mr McInnes has been designated a ""hate figure"" by Facebook.
Facebook said this year Milo Yiannopoulos had publicly praised both Mr McInnes and English Defence League founder Tommy Robinson, both banned from the network.
Laura Loomer also appeared with Mr McInnes, and Facebook said she also praised another banned figure, Faith Goldy, a Canadian.
Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan was banned for making several anti-Semitic remarks earlier this year.
Apparently it is a violation of Facebook’s policies to speak positively anywhere in public about people Facebook doesn’t like. Yiannopolous has been banned not for promoting Gavin McInnes on Facebook, but for expressing positive opinions about him in public . Can I then be banned for writing this article questioning the decision to ban these newly dubbed ""hate figures?"" I suppose I'll find out soon enough.
Indeed, it is impossible to know ahead of time whether you are operating according to the rules or in defiance of them, because the rules are intentionally obscure. What counts as ""hate"""" What is ""extreme?"" Which ideas are ""dangerous?"" Well, we can only try and narrow it down by the process of elimination.
Hamas and Hezbollah must not be considered ""hateful"" because they still have Facebook pages . This burlesque performer posted a picture of herself half-naked with a young girl stuffing dollar bills into her underwear while the girl's parents watched and cheered. She still has a page, so I guess the exploitation and abuse of children is not ""dangerous,"" according to Facebook. Speaking of which, this 11-year-old drag queen has a page, though dressing a child in drag seems both dangerous and ""extreme"" by any objective standard. PETA is extreme. The Animal Liberation Front is extreme. The National Abortions Rights Action League is extreme. Michael Moore is extreme. Sarah Silverman is extreme. Al Sharpton is extreme. Bill Maher is extreme. Everybody at the Daily Kos and Think Progress is extreme. All of these people and organizations, and the hundreds similar to them, are not only extreme but often quite hateful, yet their Facebook presence has not been interrupted by either bans or suspensions.
It seems that Facebook is operating with the same definition of ""extremism"" and ""hatred"" as the above-cited left-wing extremists themselves. If they were really interested in enforcing some objective and fair set of rules, they wouldn't have waited to issue all of these bans at the same time, as part of one big P.R. spectacle. If Alex Jones were going to be banned for spreading the insane and evil Sandy Hook conspiracy theory, Facebook would have made that move five years ago. If Yiannopolous or Watson or Loomer really did something that violates the terms of service (and, in Watson's case especially, I have no clue what that could possibly be), then they would have been kicked off the platform in response to that specific violation. Instead, Facebook handled it this way because the real ""violation"" is political. Whether these individuals can rightly be described as ""extremist"" or not, their only sin, in Facebook's eyes, is that their alleged extremism falls on the right end of the political spectrum. The extremists and hateful bigots on the Left — of which there are many — have been granted full immunity.
Two questions now arise: (1) Is Facebook correct to censor people based on politics?; and (2) Does Facebook have the moral right to censor people based on politics?
The answer to the first question is obviously no. A social media giant with over a billion users suppressing speech is far more dangerous than a right-winger expressing his views in a blog post or a YouTube video. Facebook's underhanded, dishonest, and absurdly biased actions should be condemned by anyone who cares about the free and open expression of ideas (an increasingly small group, perhaps).
The answer to the second question is more complicated. One thing I can say for sure is that Facebook does not have the right to smear and libel anyone. If they are going to publicly label someone like Paul Joseph Watson ""dangerous,"" ""hateful,"" and ""violent,"" they must provide evidence for that description. Otherwise they are baselessly defaming him, and that defamation, coming as it does from one of the most powerful companies in the world, will certainly have a negative impact on his life and professional career.
Leaving aside the libelous aspect of the matter, the question of whether or not Facebook has the moral or legal right to censor as it sees fit really comes down to category. What is Facebook? Is it a public utility, like a phone company? Is it just a ""platform?"" If so, what is a platform and how exactly can it be distinguished from a utility? Could a phone company claim that it is just a platform for phone calls? And if a platform makes editorial decisions about the content it publishes — such as allowing only negative references to Infowars — then hasn't it actually become more of a publisher than a platform? And if it's a publisher, then isn't it responsible for everything posted to the site — such as that picture of the young girl and the burlesque dancer?
I don't know the answers to all of these questions. But I do know that Facebook can't weave around the cones forever, never defining itself or explaining what it is and how it operates. Facebook has to be one thing or the other or the other. It can't be all three. And whatever it decides to be, ultimately, it must accept the responsibilties that come with that."
"Man Who Voiced ‘Winnie The Pooh’ Accused Of Rape, Abuse By Ex-Wife | Daily Wire",www.dailywire.com,Amanda Prestigiacomo,05-03-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46757/man-who-voiced-winnie-pooh-accused-rape-abuse-ex-amanda-prestigiacomo,"Man Who Voiced ‘Winnie The Pooh’ Accused Of Rape, Abuse By Ex-Wife Photo by Mike Marsland/Mike Marsland/WireImage May 3, 2019 views
Jim Cummings, the man who voiced the iconic character of “Winnie the Pooh,” has been accused of rape by his ex-wife.
According to documents obtained by The Blast, the voice actor’s ex-wife Stephanie Cummings says Jim has engaged “in physical, sexual, and emotional abuse including but not limited to death threats, rape, and various sexual deviant behavior forced upon me without my consent” since the couple’s divorce in 2011.
Stephanie claims she has two separate domestic violence restraining orders against the actor after violent incidents, including one in August of 2011, “when she says Jim came over to her home and slapped her on the buttocks and forced himself on her in front of their 4-year-old daughter,” The Blast reports.
“He later came up behind me,” the ex-wife claims, “grabbed my arm, spun me around, and forcefully put his hand on the back of my neck and kissed me while holding me in place against the wall.”
The 66-year-old actor then allegedly asked Stephanie if she could “see him leaking, because that’s what I make him do when he touches me.” She said the experience left her “humiliated and degraded.”
Jim recalled the incident differently, saying in court documents that hef was “joking and laughing” with his ex-wife. “I touched her slightly on the butt,” he recalled. “[T]the whole incident was happy” and consensual, he said, noting that Stephanie “is much taller than I am, and a large woman, made no objection to anything.”
Jim denied the alleged incident further in an email to Stephanie: “Shame on you, you’re [sic] distortions are obscene. ‘forcing?’ Please, everyone, Gracie myself and especially YOU were all giggling and laughing, it was pleasant to have one moment of light-heartedness,” he wrote. “We both erupted into laughter ... I’m hardly the first person in the world to point out one ‘catches more flys [sic] with honey than vinegar’ for you to overlay a reference to being a whore is little too telling, Let’s get this over with for the love of God.”
A police report was filed after Jim allegedly raped her in 2013, the ex claims.
“Jim would frequently ‘without consent, would touch my buttocks, my groin, and my breasts. He would hold me in place attempting to kiss and fondle me. He would spank me in front of our daughters. He would then follow up by making sexual comments to me that I found repugnant,” Stephanie said, according to the report.
The former Disney star voice actor would allegedly say he could “touch Mommy’s breasts since he had paid for them” in front of their daughters.
In 2017, Stephanie moved to Utah with their two daughters. When Jim asked to stay at their home during a visit, she accepted. “However, during the middle of the night, she claims Jim was ‘standing over me with his erect penis in my hand. He was using my hand to stroke his penis while my youngest daughter was asleep on the other side of me. She was 10 years old at the time,’” the report said.
“I told him to stop and get out of the house. He refused. He then came back and did the same thing, insisting I masturbate him or he would wake Lulu up. I did as he asked given his threat to wake up my daughter and my worry that I could not control what he would do in front of her,” claimed Stephanie.
That was when the second restraining order was allegedly obtained by Stephanie, she said."

On MAS's website, the organization did condemn the recent anti-Semitic white nationalist terror attack against the synagogue in California and the organization did condemn the Islamic terrorist attacks last month in Sri Lanka on Christian churches on Easter day.
Here is MAS's statement on the Poway synagogue attack:
Muslim American Society condemns the terrorist attack that targeted a synagogue in San Diego. As worshipers observed the last day of Passover, a 19-year old white male started targeting and shooting members of the synagogue. This person is the same individual who attacked a mosque in Escondido, 9 miles away from the Chabad Synagogue of Poway. One person is dead and three are wounded, including the Rabbi.
“Hate has no place in our society. In an era where we’ve seen an increase in hate crimes, including rising Islamophobia and anti-semitism, we must stand tall together in solidarity.” said Ayman Hammous, Executive Director of MAS, “these acts of terror in places of worship and against humanity cannot become the norm.”
MAS strongly condemns this white supremacist attack and we call on our leaders to call this out for what it is, an act of terror meant to terrorize a faith community. Places of worship are sacred and human life is sacred. The Muslim community has faced acts of hate numerous times and we stand tall with the Jewish community who also faced similar acts of hate one too many times. “We know that our faith communities are resilient. We will bounce back stronger together,” says Ismahan Abdullahi, National Deputy Director of MAS PACE, “Hate is scared of love, for it’s the only thing strong enough to keep it at bay. This world can and must do better.”
Our thoughts and prayers are with the Jewish community in Poway. We offer our sincerest condolences to all the families impacted by this tragedy. We urge all faith communities and centers to be vigilant and take extra precautions. Together, we will stand tall against hate.
Here is MAS's statement on the Christian churches in Sri Lanka:
The Muslim American Society (MAS) offers its sincerest condolences to the families of the victims of the bombings in Sri Lanka.
The bombings, which resulted in the tragic deaths and wounding of hundreds of congregants, Sri Lankans and tourists from around the world, took place during one of the holiest days in the Christian faith, Easter. MAS Executive Director Ayman Hammous said, “These senseless acts of violence do not accomplish anything other than drawing humanity into a state of chaos. We need to stand together as brothers and sisters in humanity, across all faiths, united against all acts of terror and destruction.”
MAS calls on all people to come together during these difficult times and stand for peace and justice for all. Recommended For You "
Pope Francis Criticizes The Nation-State: ‘Common Good Has Become Global’ | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Paul Bois,05-03-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46760/pope-francis-denounces-nation-state-common-good-paul-bois,"May 3, 2019 views
In the effort to stop climate change, human trafficking, and nuclear threats, Pope Francis said that nation states should give way to globalization in some aspects, calling on them to create ""intergovernmental institutions that manage their common interests.""
“In the current situation of globalization not only of the economy but also of technological and cultural exchanges, the nation-state is no longer able to procure the common good of its population alone,” Pope Francis told the Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences, according to Catholic News Agency .
The Pope did emphasize the need for subsidiarity that would allow nations to maintain their sovereignty but ultimately conceded that intergovernmental institutions would have to fill the global gaps. ""While, according to the principle of subsidiarity, individual nations must be given the power to operate as far as they can, on the other hand, groups of neighboring nations — as is already the case — can strengthen their cooperation by attributing the exercise of certain functions and services to intergovernmental institutions that manage their common interests,"" he said.
Issues like climate change and human trafficking are just two examples that Pope Francis cited that call for a ""supranational common good."" Pope Francis also touched on the issue of nationalism, which he says has sparked a rise in distrust toward migrants and a neglect of the ""common good.""
""The Church observes with concern the re-emergence, almost everywhere in the world, of aggressive currents towards foreigners, especially immigrants, as well as that growing nationalism that neglects the common good,"" Pope Francis told the professors gathered to hear him speak.
The Roman Pontiff called on nations to welcome all immigrants and to regulate migratory flows with ""virtue of prudence.""
“It is the task of public authority to protect migrants and to regulate migratory flows with the virtue of prudence, as well as to promote reception so that local populations are trained and encouraged to consciously participate in the integrating process of migrants who are welcomed,” he said. ""The way in which a nation welcomes migrants reveals its vision of human dignity and its relationship with humanity. Every human person is a member of humanity and has the same dignity.""
Earlier this week, 51 Catholic theologians and priests issued an open letter to bishops calling on them to admonish Pope Francis for speaking heresy and appointing people in powerful positions who openly flaunt Church teaching.
“We take this measure as a last resort to respond to the accumulating harm caused by Pope Francis’s words and actions over several years, which have given rise to one of the worst crises in the history of the Catholic Church,” the group said in a 20-page open letter this week that was published at LifeSiteNews .
In an 11-page letter released last year , Archbishop Viganò, former Nuncio from the Vatican to Washington, D.C., alleged that Cardinal Theodore McCarrick had been sanctioned under Pope Benedict XVI only to have those sanctions removed by Pope Francis upon his ascendancy in 2013. Cardinal McCarrick had an alleged history of sexually abusing male seminarians and, according to Viganò, was ordered by Pope Benedict to refrain from saying Mass or public ministry.
Pope Francis has still not responded to the accusations laid against him by Viganò."
Rashida Tlaib’s Father Says She ‘Lied Big-Time To Get Elected’ In Resurfaced 2010 Newspaper Article | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Ryan Saavedra,05-03-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46777/rashida-tlaibs-father-says-she-lied-big-time-get-ryan-saavedra,"Rashida Tlaib’s Father Says She ‘Lied Big-Time To Get Elected’ In Resurfaced 2010 Newspaper Article Zach Gibson/Getty Images May 3, 2019 views
In a March 11, 2010 newspaper article in The Detroit News, Rep. Rashida Tlaib's (D-MI) father accused her of lying ""big-time to get elected"" by falsifying her address on an election affidavit.
Tlaib's father, Harbi Elabed, made the accusations against Tlaib, who at the time was a freshman state-level representative from the 12th District in Detroit’s Southwest side. The newspaper article was scrubbed from the internet when The Detroit News migrated to a new website but was available in a subscription-based digital archive. The Detroit News reported:
He said his daughter misrepresented her residency when she signed an election affidavit in 2008 with the Wayne County Clerk claiming she was a citizen of Detroit.
According to that affidavit, Tlaib claimed she lived at 9123 Rathbone in Detroit. That house is owned in part by her father, Harbi Elabed, and he now says she did not live there and he was only recently made aware that she had claimed so.
""She lied,"" Elabed said. ""She lied big-time to get elected. I never teach her that way. I teach her the right way. It’s my house. She didn’t live there. She lived in Dearborn in her house with her husband and boy."" Here's the March 11, 2010, report in The Detroit News pic.twitter.com/rFe5lH0iLt — Ryan Saavedra (@RealSaavedra) May 3, 2019
The Detroit News continued:
Dearborn is not a part of the 12th House District that Tlaib was elected to represent.
Residency issues are very difficult to prove. To become a candidate, you must be a “registered and qualified elector” of that district, according to state law. That means you must have your primary residence — the address on your driver’s license and where you’re registered to vote — in that district.
There is no law however, according to state election officials, saying that a person must spend any particular number of days, weeks or months at a certain location. Perjury is an offense punishable by up to five years in prison and a $1,000 fine.
Tlaib even admitted at the time that accusations against her caused problems for her, saying: ""People have questioned that a lot, but never my father and I’m sad about that. The point is I complied with the law. I moved into the district before I filed. Period.""
The Detroit News added:
According to property and tax records, Tlaib lived in a house on Tireman in Dearborn that her husband purchased a decade ago. Taxes were paid on that house in 2009 with her husband claiming it as his primary residence.
But in 2008, as Tlaib was preparing for a run for the seat, she said she separated from her husband and moved into her father’s house with her two brothers.
Tlaib said she had bills to prove where she lived but it does not appear that she ever provided those bills to the newspaper to validate her claims.
Tlaib's father said that he came forward with the allegation because it was part of a ""growing litany of transgressions that his daughter committed upon him — culminating in a dispute about care of his aged mother, who suffers from dementia,"" adding that Tlaib ""sided against him and in favor of his nephew in a battle of custody, a complete breach of family values.""
""My sons told me blood is thicker than water and I should keep my mouth shut, so OK, I did,"" Elabed said. ""Then she crossed the line with her father. When she interferes in the father’s business, when she shows him no respect. This life in politics has changed her.""
Tlaib ended up reconciling with her husband and moved next door to her father.
""It’s not surprising that he did this to me. It’s not. He was abusive to me as a girl and he’s angry at me about my grandmother,"" Tlaib claimed. ""I know he’s proud of what I’ve accomplished but he’s also vindictive. It’s all very embarrassing. What do they say, you can’t choose your family?"" "

ERICKSON: Fighting Over The Body | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Erick Erickson,05-04-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46767/erickson-fighting-over-body-erick-erickson,"ERICKSON: Fighting Over The Body photo by David S. Holloway/Getty Images May 4, 2019 views
Read about a lot of high-profile deaths and you find families fighting over the corpses. They've long since stopped arguing about issues; they just want control over the body, and maybe an inheritance. Both sides have a sense of grievance for some emotional wound. But the fight has escalated so much that no one really remembers why it started or what the endgame should be other than control of a dead body.
Washington seems to be that way these days, and the William Barr hearing is another reminder of that.
According to Barr, Russia and others will probably try to impact the 2020 election. That should be really big news, but it wasn't. Democrats have trotted out James Comey to attack the attorney general while ignoring so many of the indiscreet things Comey has done over the past few years, including his letters about Hillary Clinton.
Suddenly, Comey is awesome because he is on the Right Side of History. Democrats who blamed him for Clinton's loss pivoted to blaming Russia once Comey signaled he was sympathetic to their cause.
Meanwhile, MSNBC hosts are speculating that perhaps the President is actually helping Russia in Venezuela, where the Russians have decided to set up shop, ignore the Monroe Doctrine and prop up a dictator that the President is actually handling responsibly. It amazed me that MSNBC anchors would suggest Donald Trump is really helping Russia on this. I get that they hate the President, but he has actually been a responsible leader on this one.
Ilhan Omar, however, has not. She's gone on a television program to denounce American treatment of Venezuela. Omar and several of her freshmen colleagues in the House of Representatives have gravitated to the ""blame America first"" crowd. The world, she would have us believe, would be a peaceful utopia, but for the United States. In her scorn, she also indicts Barack Obama's foreign policy. He did not coddle enough dictators for her.
All this is happening as Joe Biden tells everyone China is not really a threat to us, just like Russia was not a threat in 2012. Biden says China is not even competing with us. Perhaps he said something so ludicrous to distract from his own Russia scandal: His son sat on the board of a Ukrainian company with ties to the Russians and only resigned once his dad decided to run for President. Some allege that Biden previously helped pressure Ukraine into firing a prosecutor looking into that company.
No one in Washington seems to have noticed that China now has a navy in the Western Pacific that is capable of kicking our butts in a fight. In fact, the American fleet over there is still suffering from issues with leadership, training and morale. In Venezuela, the Cubans and Russians have set up shop and military operations. North Korea has gone back to building weapons of mass destruction.
Then there is our own nation's pending bankruptcy. Democrats and Republicans can only agree on spending more money together. Democrats are willing to work with Republicans on a $2 trillion infrastructure package but cannot fund a $5 billion border wall. They will not even acknowledge the situation at the border.
I'm reminded that when Rome fell into chaos, the bureaucracy still basically functioned, so it was a long time before anyone realized the empire had no pulse. It took the barbarians storming the gates to open people's eyes.
At this point, we probably ought to ask if the United States still has a pulse. It looks more and more like the political class in Washington is just fighting over the corpse. Our nation is completely unprepared for coming crises and on the verge of bankruptcy, and both sides are pointing fingers and focusing on partisan squabbles instead of real threats.
For every Democrat who would read all this and say, ""But Trump,"" I'd reply that Russian meddling began during the Obama administration after Obama said they were not a threat. Pointing fingers is beside the point now. We have problems as a nation without anyone in Washington ready to play a long game to fix them.

"In Response To FOIA, A County Clerk Gave A Reporter A PICTURE Of A CD-ROM, But Not Its Contents | Daily Wire",www.dailywire.com,Ashe Schow,05-04-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46786/response-foia-county-clerk-gave-reporter-picture-ashe-schow,"In Response To FOIA, A County Clerk Gave A Reporter A PICTURE Of A CD-ROM, But Not Its Contents Hannelore Foerster/Getty Images May 4, 2019 views
Journalists and concerned citizens file hundreds of thousands of Freedom of Information Act Requests each year, and government officials continue to find new and unique ways to avoid complying.
Each year since 2015, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), a nonprofit dedicated to free speech and transparency, publishes The Foilies , a list of the “year’s worst in government transparency.” The 2019 list contains some doozies, but perhaps none more absurd than what happened to ProPublica reporter Jessica Huseman:
ProPublica reporter Jessica Huseman has been digging deep into the child welfare system and what happens when child abuse results in death. While following up on a series of strangulations, she requested a copy of a case file from the St. Joseph County Superior Court in Indiana. Apparently, the clerk on the other end simply took the entire file and ran everything through a scanner. The problem was that the file contained a CD-ROM, and that's not how CD-ROMs work. ""Well this is the first time this had happened,"" Huseman posted to Twitter, along with the blotchy black-and-white image of the top of the disc. ""They scanned a CD as part of my FOI and didn't give me its contents. Cool cool.""
That’s right, the clerk sent her a photo of a CD-ROM but not the contents within. There are plenty of examples of ridiculous redactions in FOIA requests, but that’s certainly a novel idea.
In another example of government employees using CD-ROMS to annoy reporters who filed FOIA requests, EFF described an episode in which the CIA sent someone six discs containing eight documents – each just three to nine pages long.
Kel McClanahan, executive director of the nonprofit public interest law firm National Security Counselors, filed a request an expected eight documents. The CIA sent him the six discs containing the small documents, which could have easily fit on one.
“What makes this ‘extra silly,’ McClanahan said, is that the CIA has previously complained about how burdensome and costly fulfilling requests can be. Yet the CIA could have easily combined several requests onto the same disc and saved themselves some time and resources. After all, a standard CD-ROM can hold 700 MB, and all of the files took only 304 KB of space,” EFF reported.
Many of the other “awards” were for some serious transparency issues, like the city of Seattle telling a man he could have the information he sought for $33 million, or Michigan State Police trying to charge another report $485,645.24 – 25 cents for each line of a 1.9-million-line dataset.
One last silly example: The Federal Communications Commission tried to avoid a FOIA request for emails relating to Chairman Ajit Pai’s YouTube video “7 Things You Can Still Do on the Internet After Net Neutrality.” After some legal wrangling, Muck Rock editor JPat Brown was able to get the unredacted emails released. They showed that Pai wanted to know when the video would be live and that the FCC wanted to be able to ax the video. Oh, and one redaction literally covered up the word “OK.”"
HAWORTH: The Democrats' Obsession With Al Sharpton | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Ian Haworth,05-04-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46787/haworth-democrats-obsession-al-sharpton-ian-haworth,"May 4, 2019 views
This week, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg met with American civil rights activist and Baptist minister Al Sharpton for lunch in New York. They met to discuss “winning over the African-American community” and how to talk about Buttigieg’s sexuality with others.
Buttigieg is not the only Democratic candidate who has chosen to align himself closely to Sharpton. Beto O’Rourke, Andrew Yang, Julián Castro, John Delaney, Kamala Harris, John Hickenlooper, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Amy Klobuchar, Kirsten Gillibrand, Cory Booker, Chuck Schumer, and Eric Swalwell all appeared at the National Action Network (NAN) 2019 Convention. NAN is a non-profit organization founded by Sharpton.
Al Sharpton is one of the political personalities to whom any Democratic hopeful must bend the knee. Given that much of Sharpton’s past behavior seems to be at odds with the Democrat’s claim of moral superiority, a growing number of conservatives are asking why Sharpton holds such a significant influence over the American Left.
Sharpton’s first major controversy involved the infamous 1987 Tawana Brawley rape case. Despite “overwhelming evidence” leading the grand jury to determine that Brawley had fabricated her story, Sharpton accused Dutchess County prosecutor, Steven Pagones, of racism and being one of the perpetrators in the alleged abduction and rape. Even though he was successfully sued for defamation, Sharpton refused to pay his share of the damages.
He also faced heavy criticism for his role in the Crown Heights race riots of 1991. During the funeral of Gavin Cato, a seven-year-old boy who was accidentally killed by one of the cars in the motorcade of the leader of an Orthodox Jewish Hasidic movement, Sharpton said: “It’s an accident to allow an apartheid ambulance service in the middle of Crown Heights.” During the Crown Heights riots, Yankel Rosenbaum, a 29-year-old Jewish student, was surrounded, beaten and stabbed. He later died in the hospital. Many criticized Sharpton for his role in inflaming tensions, citing remarks such as “If the Jews want to get it on, tell them to pin their yarmulkes back and come over to my house”.
Sharpton’s finances have also come under severe scrutiny. In 2017, he sold the rights to his life story to the National Action Network (his own non-profit) for $531,000, adding to the $244,661 he took as compensation from NAN that year. According to The New York Times , as of November of 2014, Sharpton and his for-profit businesses owe $4.5 million in federal and state taxes.
He has also made multiple racially-charged statements. During a speech in 1994 at Kean College, Sharpton stated: “Do some cracker come and tell you, ‘Well my mother and father blood go back to the Mayflower,' you better hold your pocket. That ain’t nothing to be proud of, that means their forefathers was crooks.” When speaking of Mitt Romney in 2007, Sharpton said: “As for the one Mormon running for office, those who really believe in God will defeat him anyways, so don’t worry about that; that’s a temporary situation.”
Given these examples, many conservatives are understandably confused as to why Sharpton still seems to exercise power and influence over the Democratic Party. After all, how would the Left react if a conservative had behaved in this way?
However, when we understand who the Democrats have become, it becomes perfectly clear. They are the party of the baseless accusations against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, the Jussie Smollett hate-crime hoax, and the spread and legitimization of anti-Semitism.
Of course they would stand in line to bend the knee. Al Sharpton showed them the way. "
KLAVAN: Facebook Censorship Should be Stopped | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Andrew Klavan,05-04-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46789/klavan-facebook-censorship-should-be-stopped-andrew-klavan,"May 4, 2019 views
""I disapprove of what you say but I will defend to the death your right to say it.""
These words, written by Evelyn Beatrice Hall to describe the philosophy of Voltaire, should be written on Mark Zuckerberg’s forehead in indelible ink.
Zuckerberg’s Facebook — and Instagram as well — have permanently banned several people they deem ""dangerous"" from their sites. Among the deplatformed are Infowars’ Alex Jones, Nation of Islam’sLouis Farrakhan and provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos.
Jones is a lunatic conspiracy theorist, Farrakhan is a hate-filled anti-semite and Yiannopoulos has pushed anti-liberal trolling to the point of fascism. It would be too little to say I disagree with their points of view. I despise their points of view.
But it is not only wrong for Facebook and Instagram to silence them, they have no right to do it and they should be forced to allow them back on their sites.
Facebook and Instagram are platforms not publishers. Unlike publishers, who can curate their content and are thus responsible for their content, platforms cannot be sued if slanderous material appears on them. In return for that immunity, they should be forced to allow all voices to speak. They should no more be able to censor people than the phone company should be allowed to stop Milo and Farrakhan from having a phone chat about whom they hate the most.
Facebook’s blatant and, to my mind, illegal act of censorship has nothing to do with keeping people safe. It has to do with silencing conservatives. Farrakhan — who has swanned around with Barack Obama, Eric Holder and most of the black congressional caucus — is the spoonful of leftist sugar meant to make the poisoning of the right go down. All the other targets are on the right.
Donald Trump has been so successful in taking over the phrase ""fake news,"" it’s easy to forget it originated on the left as part of a plan to shut down conservative speech. That plan is now in full operation.
Sharyl Attkisson, the investigative reporter who was forced out of CBS News when CBS refused to run stories that exposed the corruption of the Obama administration, has traced the origin of the “fake news” concept to a company called First Draft. First Draft got much of its funding from Google, whose parent company is run by one of Hillary Clinton’s biggest supporters. After First Draft started beating the ""fake news"" drum during the 2016 campaign, the cry was taken up by Hillary and Obama and, most urgently, by left-wing activist David Brock, who ran the George Soros-funded Media Matters, and other pro-left attack sites.
But the anti-conservative ""fake news"" campaign really took off in December of 2016 after a man fired off some bullets in Comet Ping Pong, the D.C. pizza parlor associated with Pizzagate. Pizzagate, you’ll recall, was the lunatic right-wing conspiracy theory that involved Hillary and others running a child sex ring out of Comet.
But did the conspiracy theory really originate on the right? Comet, after all, was run by one of Brock’s former boyfriends.
In any case, Brock had promised he was going to get Facebook and other major platforms to curate their content with the help of left-leaning organizations like Southern Poverty Law Center and Factcheck.Org. And after the shooting, he succeeded. Since the ""fake news"" push, right-wingers, almost exclusively, have become targets of censorship on Facebook, Twitter and other social media platforms.
It’s got to stop, and the government’s got to stop it. If Facebook is a publisher who can silence Jones and the rest, then we ought to be able to sue Facebook for every slanderous comment that appears on the site.

"Bill & Hillary Clinton Book Tour Prices Slashed, Tickets Now Available For Less Than $10 | Daily Wire",www.dailywire.com,Emily Zanotti,05-04-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46795/bill-hillary-clinton-book-tour-prices-slashed-emily-zanotti,"Bill & Hillary Clinton Book Tour Prices Slashed, Tickets Now Available For Less Than $10 Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images May 4, 2019 views
A winter-long hiatus has not improved demand for tickets to Bill and Hillary Clinton's joint ""book tour,"" and seats can be had for the pair's final performances for less than $10.
The tour concludes this weekend with stops at the Forum Theater in Los Angeles, California, on Saturday night, and at the Park Theater at the Park MGM resort and casino in Las Vegas, Nevada on Sunday night. Neither venue is sold out and tickets for both appearances are widely available not just on Ticketmaster, but on a number of secondary market sites as well.
On Friday night, the New York Post reports , organizers were forced to ""slash listed prices and even offer discount ducats through Groupon to boost sales"" at Seattle’s WaMu Theater. Even the best seats in the house, which once cost around $1700, were available Friday night for around $800 — more than half off the suggested retail price.
Even ""The West Wing's"" Bradley Whitford, who emceed the event and conducted the interview with Bill and Hillary Clinton couldn't manage to salvage the affair.
Secondary ticket marketplace, StubHub, has tickets for Saturday evening's show in LA available for a mere $6 — and that's for a floor seat. Similar-priced tickets are available in the arena's first and second bowls. The best ticket currently available on StubHub — a third row, middle, floor section seat — is just $47.50.
Parking at LA's Forum Theater may actually cost you more than seeing the main event.
Sunday night's event, at the Park MGM, is at a smaller venue, so ticket prices are a bit higher. Balcony seats will run attendees around $20 . The best seat in the house is around $475, but those probably won't sell, especially when Ticketmaster still has seats available for the event , in the same section but a few rows ahead for just $228 plus taxes and fees; the event isn't even sold out, and it's been on the calendar since last year, and was even rescheduled after the Clintons dropped out to go to former President George H. W. Bush's funeral.
Fortunately, after Sunday night, “An Evening With the Clintons” will be out of its misery.
The Clintons started the tour as a way of ""connecting"" (and earning major cash) following Hillary's loss in the 2016 presidential campaign, though the pair promised not to address the ""Trump issue,"" and focus instead on their collective time in power. Initially, promoters anticipated swift ticket sales and a response comparable to Michelle Obama's sold out, blockbuster, arena book tour.
It didn't work out that way. Plagued by bad ticket sales and ""exhaustion,"" Bill and Hillary Clinton called time on the fall half of their tour, perhaps thinking the spring weather — or maybe the Mueller report — would yield better results. Sadly, that wasn't the case. Audiences simply weren't interested, and the were even less interested when it became clear neither Bill nor Hillary had any intention of discussing Trump.
On Friday, Hillary waxed poetic about ""constitutional crises"" and the ""rule of law"" but never mentioned her 2016 arch-nemesis.
“I really believe that we are in a crisis, a constitutional crisis,” Hillary Clinton told the Seattle audience. “We are in a crisis of confidence and a crisis over the rule of law and the institutions that have weathered a lot of problems over so many years. And it is something that, regardless of where you stand in the political spectrum, should give real heartburn to everybody. Because this is a test for our country.”
Bill Clinton, who has a stunning lack of irony, added, ""These people, they don’t believe the same set of rules apply to them that apply to everyone else.”
The pair said they feel ""optimistic"" about the 2020 elections, perhaps because they'll finally be retired. "
Nancy Pelosi Warns Democrats That President Trump Won't 'Respect' Losing Election Results | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Emily Zanotti,05-05-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46801/nancy-pelosi-warns-democrats-president-trump-wont-emily-zanotti,"Nancy Pelosi Warns Democrats That President Trump Won't 'Respect' Losing Election Results Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call via Getty Images May 5, 2019 views
Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) says she's warning fellow Democrats that if President Donald Trump isn't defeated by a sizable margin in the 2020 presidential elections that he won't respect the outcome of the vote and may refuse to leave office.
Mediaite reports that the newly crowned Speaker of the House has also been cautioning her colleagues to remain more moderate on the campaign trail so that they don't ""play into Trump's hands"" and accidentally verify his claims that Democrats intend to move the country toward socialism.
“If we win by four seats, by a thousand votes each, he’s not going to respect the election,” Pelosi told The New York Times in a wide-ranging interview published Sunday, adding that she had the same concerns before the 2018 election, when Democrats retook the House of Representatives.
“He would poison the public mind. He would challenge each of the races; he would say you can’t seat these people,” she told the NYT. “We had to win. Imagine if we hadn’t won — oh, don’t even imagine. So, as we go forward, we have to have the same approach.”
Pelosi then added that she and Democrats believe they have to ""inoculate"" against the possibility that ""Mr. Trump would not give up power voluntarily if he lost re-election.""
Part of her strategy of ""inoculation"" involves convincing fellow Democrats that impeachment is not the best route for challenging the president in Congress. Instead, she believes, Democrats should focus on making the 2020 elections a referendum on Trump's performance and his culpability in obstructing Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into whether Trump's campaign colluded with Russian officials to alter the outcome of the 2016 presidential election.
""Do not get dragged into a protracted impeachment bid that will ultimately get crushed in the Republican-controlled Senate, and do not risk alienating the moderate voters who flocked to the party in 2018 by drifting too far to the left,"" Pelosi suggests, according to the NYT.
Pelosi's comments will be surprising to both Democrats and Republicans. Democrats are certainly anticipating the 2020 race for the presidential nomination to be between members of the party's far-left progressive wing, and not between moderates representing the center-left. Progressive activists are desperately pushing the party to nominate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) as a way of ""making up"" for the socialist candidate's defeat in 2016. And even though the more moderate former Vice President Joe Biden is in the lead, there is a visible, concerted effort to derail his potential campaign.
Republicans may be surprised to learn that Democrats, including Pelosi, are still operating under the delusion that President Donald Trump is the most likely 2020 candidate to refuse to accept election results, particularly given that former Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton is still re-litigating the 2016 election, and that key Democratic candidates, like former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams, are refusing to accept even certified election results.
Clinton, for example, told a Los Angeles audience Saturday night that she believes she was robbed of the presidency back in 2016. In response to a question about 2020 from @TedDanson , @HillaryClinton just said that “you can run the best campaign,” and “still have the election stolen from you.” #BillandHill pic.twitter.com/T5Unen8Kx6 — Michael Soneff (@Soneff) May 5, 2019
Of course, Clinton didn't ""run the best campaign,"" — and not even by Democratic standards. She skipped several key states, like Michigan and Wisconsin, where faulty internal polling showed her far ahead. As a result, she failed to get the number of Electoral College votes needed to solidify a victory.
Abrams told an audience last week that she wasn't governor of Georgia ""yet,"" despite losing the state by more than 50,000 votes. "
"Robert Mueller Scheduled To Testify Before Congress On May 15, Democratic Lawmaker Claims | Daily Wire",www.dailywire.com,Emily Zanotti,05-05-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46799/robert-mueller-scheduled-testify-congress-may-15-emily-zanotti,"Robert Mueller Scheduled To Testify Before Congress On May 15, Democratic Lawmaker Claims Alex Wong/Getty Images May 5, 2019 views
Rep. David Cicilline (D-RI) told Fox News Sunday that Special Counsel Robert Mueller is ""tentatively"" expected to testify in front of the House Judiciary Committee on May 15 — a reversal from Mueller's earlier pledge to remain publicly mum on the contents of his final report, issued last month.
Neither Mueller nor the House Committee itself could confirm that Mueller plans to attend the scheduled May 15 hearing, Politico reports , so it is not immediately clear what inspired Cicilline's assertion. House Judiciary Committee chairman Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-NY) told media last week that his office had been communicating with Mueller's office, and that he and others on the committee were ""eyeing"" May 15 as a tentative date for Mueller's testimony, but nothing had been set in stone.
""A tentative date has been set for May 15 and we hope the Special Counsel will appear,"" Cicilline, said during his interview. ""We think the American people have a right to hear directly from him.""
Cicilline called the agreement ""tentative,"" he said, because ""the representative for the Special Counsel has"" signed off on the scheduled hearing but that ""until the day comes, we never have an absolute guarantee.""
Last week, Attorney General William Barr had reportedly agreed to testify in front of the same House Committee but did not show up the day of the hearing after discovering that Democrats intended to question Barr through legal counsel, similar to how the Senate Judiciary Committee questioned then-Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh over claims that he sexually assaulted a high school classmate decades ago.
Apparently sensing that Democrats intended to turn the hearing into a circus, Barr simply skipped the hearing altogether. A Democratic committee member placed a plastic chicken behind Barr's name placard at the witness table instead, giving focus to Democrats who spent the hearing making independent proclamations.
Democrats are desperate to question Mueller over both the conclusions reached in his report on collusion between the Trump 2016 presidential campaign and Russian officials looking to alter the outcome of the 2016 presidential elections, and over statements made last week indicating that he felt his conclusions, particularly on the subject of President Donald Trump's attempted ""obstruction of justice,"" were twisted by members of the media.
Convinced that Attorney General Barr also ""misled"" Congress on the subject of obstruction of justice, CNN reports , Democrats are also interested in asking Mueller how he feels about Barr's interpretation of his report, both in a letter issued the weekend Mueller's report was completed and in subsequent statements Barr made to lawmakers.
The White House has said it will not object ot Mueller speaking in front of any Congressional committee, and Cicilline told ""Fox News Sunday"" that the White House has ""so far indicated they would not interfere with Mr. Mueller's attempts to testify.""
Although Mueller's conclusions about ""collusion"" aren't really in question, Democrats have said they intend to re-run Mueller's 22-month deep dive into whether Trump aides communicated and coordinated with Russian officials looking to make an impact on the 2016 presidential election. Although Democrats have initiated more than 60 individual investigations into the Trump White House, the Trump campaign, and Trump businesses, their primary focus appears to be on the president's campaign team.

Trump Sends ‘Clear And Unmistakable’ Message To Iran | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Ryan Saavedra,05-06-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46807/trump-sends-clear-and-unmistakable-message-iran-ryan-saavedra,"Trump Sends ‘Clear And Unmistakable’ Message To Iran Felix Wong/South China Morning Post via Getty Images May 5, 2019 views
The Trump administration is sending a carrier strike group and a bomber task force to the Middle East to send a ""clear and unmistakable message"" in response to ""a number of troubling and escalatory indications and warnings.""
""The deployment comes less than a month after the Trump administration designated Iran's elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) a terrorist organization,"" Fox News reported . ""The deployment also comes amid the bloodiest fighting in five years between Israel and Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip.""
""In response to a number of troubling and escalatory indications and warnings, the United States is deploying the USS Abraham Lincoln Carrier Strike Group and a bomber task force to the U.S. Central Command region to send a clear and unmistakable message to the Iranian regime that any attack on United States interests or on those of our allies will be met with unrelenting force,"" Bolton said. ""The United States is not seeking war with the Iranian regime, but we are fully prepared to respond to any attack, whether by proxy, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, or regular Iranian forces.""
Former Israeli national security adviser Yaakov Amidror said on Sunday that Iran was behind the increasing escalation in Gaza.
""What made Friday’s shooting on the IDF patrol interesting, Amidror said, was that it took place precisely when Hamas and Islamic Jihad leaders were in Cairo putting the finishing touches on an agreement drawn up by Egypt that was designed to ease the tension in the South,"" The Jerusalem Post reported . ""But while its leaders were in Cairo, Islamic Jihad fired on the soldiers. At first, the organization tried to deny responsibility for the attack.""
""Why did the Islamic Jihad do this?"" Amidror asked. ""The answer is again and again and again – Iran.""
""[Islamic Jihad] was established by Iran, financed by Iran, and does what Iran wants it to do,' Amidror said, adding that the Iranian idea is that ""Israel will be busy focusing on Gaza and not have enough energy to deal with the building up of an independent war machine in Syria.""
Iran has continued to spew hatred towards Israel in recent days while clearly indicating it wants to destroy Israel.
In a recent Iranian sermon translated by the Middle East Media Research Institute, ""Mohammad Baqer Ebadi congratulated IRGC Major-General Hossein Salami on his recent appointment as commander of the IRGC,"" MEMRI reported . MEMRI provides the following translation of part of the sermon:
There is a new commander for the IRGC – Gen. [Hossein] Salami. We wish him success. General Salami said something once – he made a brief remark that still bothers the Zionists. In one speech, he said: ""The Israelis have nowhere to run. In the north, they have Hizbullah. In another part, they have the Hamas. On this side, they have Syria, and all around there are Muslim peoples, even though some of the governments have sold themselves out."" He said: ""Netanyahu should start learning how to swim in the Mediterranean Sea."" He meant that when Netanyahu wants to flee, this will be his only way to escape. This is why he should learn how to swim. I hope Mr. Netanyahu learns quickly how to swim, because Salami has finally arrived. He is the commander of the army of Islam. If Netanyahu has not yet learned how to swim, he should do it before it's too late because, Allah willing, the day is drawing near. According to some traditions, the wounded Zionists will step over their dead while trying to escape, but they will be killed.

"Norwegian Air Nixes Heels, Makeup Requirement For Flight Attendants After Serious Backlash | Daily Wire",www.dailywire.com,Paul Bois,05-05-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46790/norwegian-air-nixes-heels-makeup-requirement-paul-bois,"Norwegian Air Nixes Heels, Makeup Requirement For Flight Attendants After Serious Backlash ""We now allow female crew members to wear flat shoes at all times"" Bloomberg / Contributor / Getty Images May 5, 2019 views
The female flight attendants for Norwegian Air will be a great deal more comfortable now that the company has lifted its requirement for them to wear heels and makeup, according to Fox News .
Last month, the airline made headlines when reports surfaced that flight attendants were under such a strict dress code that they had to present a doctors note if they wanted to wear flat shoes outside the aircraft when greeting passengers. The policy also forbid women wearing more than two rings per hand and nothing on the thumbs. All jewelry had to be made from gold or silver metal; necklaces could not have any religious symbolism.
According to USA Today , a spokesperson for Norwegian Air, Anders Lindström, confirmed that policy has been laid to waste.
""We now allow female crew members to wear flat shoes at all times and no makeup if they choose, male crew members can also wear light makeup,"" said Lindström. ""Our cabin crew have always been required to wear flat shoes while working on board our aircraft for their safety and comfort. As a responsible employer, we are in continuous dialogue with our cabin crew colleagues to see how we can improve our uniform guidelines.""
At the time of the controversy, Norwegian Air defended its dress code as being ""neutral and discrete"" while being ""similar to other airlines.""
""We are willing to review the guidelines again internally and make necessary changes if there is a wish to do so among our cabin crew globally,"" Lindström said at the time. ""It is certainly not our intention to offend or provoke anyone with our uniform guidelines, externally or internally.""
Though Norwegian Air allowed flight attendants to wear flat shoes on the airplane, The Independent reports the backlash crescendoed into an eventual fever-pitch, with critics saying that the airline operated according to the rules of a ""Mad Men Universe"" — a reference to the AMC show.
""It is almost comical that we face these issues in 2019,” a women’s spokesperson for the country’s Socialist Left Party told Norwegian newspaper VG . “While the rest of society has moved on, Norwegian is stuck in the Mad Men universe from the 1950’s and ‘60s."" The Norwegian Labour Party’s women’s spokesperson Anette Trettebergstuen said the dress code went way beyond simple uniform requirements. ""Uniform requirements are one thing, but to impose heels and makeup is going too far,” Trettebergstuen said. ""The year 1950 rang and it wants its rulebook back. This is super embarrassing and they should have progressed further.""
Following the backlash, an online petition began circulating that racked up 20,000 signatures demanding that Norwegian Air change the policy. The Independent reports that other airlines have already implemented similar changes.
""Last month, Aer Lingus announced it will not require female cabin crew to wear makeup or skirts anymore. The flag carrier airline of Ireland said it had made the decision in response to feedback sessions with staff across many departments,"" reports the outlet. ""This came after Virgin Atlantic revealed makeup and skirts would cease to be mandatory for female staff days earlier."" "

Far-left Reps. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) and Ilhan Omar (D-MN) attacked Israel on Sunday and defended the Palestinian terrorist attacks that targeted Israel over the weekend.
The Jerusalem Post reported that approximately 700 rockets were fired at Israel from Palestinian terrorists in the Gaza Strip and that the Iron Dome intercepted approximately 173 of the rockets.
""Terror groups Hamas and Islamic jihad in Gaza have fired over 700 rockets at Israel since Friday, killing four Israelis and wounding dozens,"" The Jerusalem Post reported , adding : ""Defiant Hamas and Islamic Jihad officials said on Sunday that they don’t rule out the possibility that the current round of fighting in the Gaza Strip could lead to an all-out war with Israel.""
""The latest round of violence began two days ago when an Islamic Jihad sniper fired at Israeli troops, wounding two soldiers,"" Reuters reported .
Omar and Tlaib, who are both well-documented anti-Semites , rushed to attack Israel and defended the terrorism that was being carried out against Israel.
In response to a New York Times headline that stated that Palestinian terrorists had fired hundreds of rockets into Israel, Tlaib wrote on Twitter: ""When will the world stop dehumanizing our Palestinian people who just want to be free?

Omar took a more aggressive stance defending the terrorists, writing: ""How many more protesters must be shot, rockets must be fired, and little kids must be killed until the endless cycle of violence ends?

On Sunday, after Hamas had launched hundreds of rockets indiscriminately at Israel and murdered Israelis while wounding scores of other Israelis, anti-Semitic Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) attacked Israel once again, blaming Israel for shooting “protesters” and insisting that Israel was occupying Gaza.
Rep. Liz Cheney, furious, fired back with a blistering tweet, blasting, “how many times will @IlhanMN rush to the defense of terrorists?”
Omar tweeted, “How many more protesters must be shot, rockets must be fired, and little kids must be killed until the endless cycle of violence ends? The status quo of occupation and humanitarian crisis in Gaza is unsustainable.

One conservative commenter decided to give Omar a short lesson in history, noting succinctly, “Israel pulled out of Gaza in 2005. There is no occupation.

Cheney has aggressively countered Omar’s anti-Semitic rhetoric before; in March Cheney gave a statement to The Daily Wire in which she ripped House Democrats over their lame resolution condemning hate following Omar’s anti-Semitic rhetoric. Cheney stated, ""Today’s resolution vote was a sham put forward by Democrats to avoid condemning one of their own and denouncing vile anti-Semitism. While I stand whole heartedly against discrimination outlined in this resolution, the language before the House today did not address the issue that is front and center. Rep. Omar’s comments were wrong and she has proven multiple times that she embodies a vile, hate-filled, anti-Semitic, anti-Israel bigotry. She deserves to be rebuked, by name, and removed from the House Foreign Affairs Committee so that there is no mistake about the values and priorities that the House stands for.""
Cheney continued, ""For Democratic leadership to kowtow to their radical members and refuse to offer legislative language that criticizes Rep. Omar’s statements in the strongest possible manner confirms what we already knew: that their party is controlled by far-left extremists who can’t even muster the courage to stand up to blatant anti-Semitism. This is a sad day for the House and Democrats’ lack of action is fully responsible for bringing us to this unfortunate moment.""
Omar twisting the facts about Israel and Hamas to fit her narrative is not unusual for her; this is the same woman who blamed the United States for killing “thousands” of Somalis in the 1993 Battle of Mogadishu, as The Daily Wire has reported, exaggerating the number of casualties and ignoring the fact that American forces were in Somali on a humanitarian mission to save starving Somalis and protect food and aid from being stolen by warring factions. Omar seemingly referred to U.S. forces as “Satan,” responding to a commenter who noted the number of American lives lost by tweeting, “In his selective memory, he forgets to also mention the thousands of Somalis killed by the American forces that day! #NotTodaySatan .” In his selective memory, he forgets to also mention the thousands of Somalis killed by the American forces that day! #NotTodaySatan https://t.co/wrFocrZymQ "

The usual suspects came out in support of the people who launched rockets at Israel over the weekend. Sadly, it is not surprising to see the likes of Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) or Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) siding with terrorists. It should , of course, be surprising — shocking, even — for members of the United States Congress to express such views, but we are far past being shocked over terror-sympathizing among Democrats. Yet there is one thing — one little three-letter word — that makes this case significantly different. Reacting to what she considered an unfair headline in The New York Times, Tlaib tweeted this:
When will the world stop dehumanizing our Palestinian people who just want to be free? Headlines like this & framing it in this way just feeds into the continued lack of responsibility on Israel who unjustly oppress & target Palestinian children and families. #FreePalestine
Uh. ""Our?"" Tlaib does not call them just ""Palestinian people,"" or ""the Palestinian people,"" but instead adds the possessive ""our,"" transforming this from run-of-the-mill Democratic terror-sympathizing to a declaration of loyalty to a foreign entity. I don't think I'm making too much of this. We should all be profoundly disturbed to see a representative of the American government using the phrase ""our people"" in reference to those who are not American.
I have heard two excuses for this wording choice. One is that she meant it in a global sense. When she said ""our,"" she meant ""our"" as in ""the world's."" We are all one people, one world, etc. I would still have a problem with that kind of one-world rhetoric from an American politician, but that's clearly not what she meant. Besides, how would the media react if President Trump made a similar expression of global unity by referring to ""our Russian people""?
The other excuse is that Tlaib is a self-described ""Palestinian American,"" despite the fact she was born in Detroit. If she still considers Palestinians to be ""her people,"" how is that not an example of dual loyalty? How can we expect her to keep America's interest first at heart, and her constituents' interests at heart, if ""her people"" are in the Middle East?
Indeed, I probably do her a favor by accusing her of dual loyalty. In reality, there is little evidence that she is loyal to America at all. She already has a history of making anti-American statements. Consider how she described her feelings after 9-11:
“I immediately called my brothers and told them to be very careful who you hang out with. Telling my sisters, ‘Just be real careful out there,’ and being really afraid of my fellow Americans.”
Here Tlaib identifies herself as an American, but only in the context of expressing fear and suspicion of Americans. Now she tells us that Palestinians are her people. This is beyond merely concerning. It calls for an investigation, though none will be conducted for fear of ""racism"" charges.

On Monday, Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ) strayed from the far-left base of the Democratic Party and unapologetically voiced her support for Israel as Hamas launched hundreds of rockets at the nation.
""I condemn the rocket attacks on innocent civilians and stand in support of Israel and peace,"" the Democrat posted to Twitter. I condemn the rocket attacks on innocent civilians and stand in support of Israel and peace. — Kyrsten Sinema (@SenatorSinema) May 6, 2019
As noted by The Hill, Sinema spoke at an Arizona-based AIPAC event in February. ""Our support for a secure Israel as a beacon of democracy must remain unwavering,"" the Democrat wrote in a tweet. ""Proud to speak at [AIPAC] Phoenix dinner last night about strengthening and deepening this alliance."" Our support for a secure Israel as a beacon of democracy must remain unwavering.

Sinema is one of the few voices on the Left — certainly within the freshman class — expressing support for Israel, an ally of the United States, as the nation was indiscriminately bombarded by rockets this weekend.
For example, Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), tweeted Sunday: ""When will the world stop dehumanizing our Palestinian people who just want to be free? Headlines like this & framing it in this way just feeds into the continued lack of responsibility on Israel who unjustly oppress & target Palestinian children and families. #FreePalestine.""

""How many more protesters must be shot, rockets must be fired, and little kids must be killed until the endless cycle of violence ends? The status quo of occupation and humanitarian crisis in Gaza is unsustainable. Only real justice can bring about security and lasting peace,"" wrote Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) in a tweet published on Sunday. How many more protesters must be shot, rockets must be fired, and little kids must be killed until the endless cycle of violence ends?

Rep. Omar has been routinely criticized for comments deemed anti-Semitic. In February, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) blasted Omar for her ""use of anti-Semitic tropes.""
""Congresswoman Omar’s use of anti-Semitic tropes and prejudicial accusations about Israel’s supporters is deeply offensive,"" said a statement from Pelosi, co-signed by other party leaders, according to Politico. ""We condemn these remarks and we call upon Congresswoman Omar to immediately apologize for these hurtful comments.""
Pelosi, however, has since rationalized Omar’s comments, suggesting the Democrat did not know the ""full weight of the words."" The House speaker also went to bat for Omar when President Donald Trump attacked her for suggesting the 9/11 terror attack that killed 3,000 Americans was a mere instance when ""some people did something.""

"HAMMER: With Israel’s Election Over, The Time Is Now For An Operation To Utterly Destroy Hamas | Daily Wire",www.dailywire.com,Josh Hammer,05-06-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46830/hammer-israels-election-over-time-now-operation-josh-hammer,"May 6, 2019 views
""It's like déjà vu all over again,"" once quipped the ever-quotable New York Yankees Hall of Fame catcher Yogi Berra.
Has there ever been a more depressingly apt descriptor for the unrelenting horror of the dastardly duo of Muslim Brotherhood jihadist franchise Hamas and Iran-managed Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) teaming up to rain recalcitrant rocket fire hell on Israeli civilians?
This weekend marked yet another deeply tragic and harrowing weekend for our Israeli allies. Hamas, the genocidal Sunni sharia supremacist death cult democratically elected by a radicalized Gazan populace after then-Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's disastrous unilateral withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, combined with PIJ to rain approximately 700 missiles this past weekend upon Israeli civilian infrastructure. Due to a seemingly providential combination of jihadist technological incompetence and Israel's Iron Dome missile defense system having an 80+% success rate, the weekend death toll for Israelis was a mere — still deeply saddening — four.
Internal Palestinian-Arab politics are infamously messy. PIJ, which operates as somewhat of a rogue outfit in the Strip and takes direct orders from the terrorist Shiite regime in Tehran, first initiated this round of rocket escalation. But it is longtime Israeli policy to hold Hamas, which nominally governs Gaza, as solely responsible for all rockets fired from Gaza into Israel. And it is Hamas, furthermore, which shows increasingly strong gains throughout Judea and Samaria, where it repeatedly undercuts the kleptocratic , venal Palestinian Authority (PA) government. Indeed, Holocaust-denying PA chieftain Mahmoud Abbas, who is currently in the 14th year of his four-year term, refuses to hold elections due in no small measure to the fact that he knows Hamas would win them.
The Palestinian-Arabs are a wholly radicalized and generally Jew-hating populace. But don't take it from me: According to the liberal Anti-Defamation League's 2014 survey , an astounding 93% of Palestinian-Arabs hold anti-Semitic views. The following video from this past weekend is, as the adage goes, worth (at least) a thousand words: Palestinians in Gaza cheer and chant ""Allahu Akbar"" (God is great) as rockets targeting Israeli civilians are launched from nearby. pic.twitter.com/I7vA5dpRfU — Avi Mayer (@AviMayer) May 4, 2019
This is not a healthy culture. Indeed, one cursory glance at the decades-long Israeli-Palestinian conflict ought to axiomatically reveal the Left's multiculturalist idolatry as the massive lie that it is. All cultures are not, in fact, equal .
The upshot is that it is not at all clear what potentially gruesome horror might succeed Hamas in Gaza. True, some Gazans have recently taken to protesting Hamas quite publicly — but this is still a largely Jew-hating, pro-Islamist civilian population.
And yet, Israel — as a sovereign nation that has a moral duty to protect its civilians against enemy combatants, and which cannot be held to a different standard than any other nation of the world — increasingly has no choice but to act decisively. Indeed, with urban centers such as Tel Aviv now under threat from longer-range missiles, the situation is increasingly dire. In March, I laid out the case for Israel to utterly destroy Hamas once and for all:
Try as the Israel Defense Forces might to keep on "" mowing the grass"" when the ""infidel""-loathing jihadists of Hamas flare up in impulsive paroxysms of ""anti-Zionism"" Jew-hatred, the status quo in Gaza is completely unsustainable. No other sovereign country on Earth would deal so passively with such a cancerous threat living on its border — with its biggest civilian centers under constant fear of city-wide sirens signaling the incoming threat of crude Iran-manufactured rockets fired haphazardly from a bordering terroristic death cult. Indeed, no sovereign country on Earth should have to deal with such a threat. If the Sinaloa Cartel or Cartel de Jalisco Nueva Generacion ever decided to shoot terrorist rockets at Texan or Arizonan ranchers, the United States would (rightfully) send in M1 Abrams tanks across the Rio Grande tomorrow. ...
It is long past time for the Israeli government to commence a full-on, comprehensive land/air invasion to hunt down and permanently root out every last one of the Hamas leadership there. Israel surely has no interest in formally re-annexing Gaza — calamitous as Sharon's withdrawal was, the Israeli government could not be any less interested in now re-absorbing the radicalized Arab populace there. And while the Israel Defense Forces would no doubt suffer high and tragic casualties as a result of a prolonged land invasion, one is forced to consider the tradeoff of inaction — the continuance of the status quo. And that status quo is truly terrible for all parties involved.
But in addition to the moral and strategic calculation of deciding whether to commence such a comprehensive land/air invasion, it is important to emphasize the timing aspect of such a decision. Specifically, it is imperative that Israel launch such an operation within — at the latest — the next calendar year.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who leads a right-wing, pro-Israeli sovereignty coalition, was just re-elected to once again lead the Jewish state. As Daniel Polisar recently explicated at the indispensable Mosaic Magazine, furthermore, Israel's decision to once again hand the reins of government to Netanyahu makes ample sense . A man forever hardened by the tragedy that befell his dear older brother Yoni in Entebbe, Bibi grasps the nature of genocidal, irredentist sharia supremacism in a way that perhaps no other Western leader can. In the bloody aftermath of the Oslo Accords-induced Second Intifada, Israelis trust Bibi to keep them safe. Period.
But not only does Israel have a present leader uniquely capable of summoning the will to plan and execute an extended land/air invasion to extirpate in Hamas in Gaza. From the perspective of American politics, the time to launch such an investigation is also right now . Because while the Jew-hating ignoramuses of the ""international community"" — best embodied by that wretched hive of Western values-hating scum and anti-Semitic villainy known as the United Nations — would inevitably howl and shriek regardless of any extended extra-territorial Israeli military operation, there can be no serious doubt that this, the most pro-Israel , pro-Jewish presidential administration in a century or more, would enthusiastically have Israel's physical and proverbial back.
Israel simply cannot risk waiting until the eve of the 2020 presidential election — not with a menagerie of anti-Israel dunderheads competing for the nomination of what is an increasingly openly anti-Semitic Democratic Party. A comprehensive Gaza operation to root out and destroy Hamas simply must be commenced with Trump as president. There is no other choice.
The status quo in Gaza is unsustainable. Israel has the best possible governing coalition to go in guns blazing and systemically eradicate a Sunni jihadist outfit raining perpetual hill on the Jewish state's civilians. Furthermore, the best possible American president is in office right now — although an election looms next year.
All that is missing is Netanyahu summoning the requisite political will to call the right shot. "
Tiger Woods Criticized For Accepting Presidential Medal Of Freedom | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Paul Bois,05-06-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46835/tiger-woods-criticized-accepting-presidential-paul-bois,"Tiger Woods Criticized For Accepting Presidential Medal Of Freedom ""I can’t recall a business partner"" Andrew Redington / Staff / Getty Images May 6, 2019 views
In the age of President Trump, even renowned golfer Tiger Woods is great again — and that's just too much for some people. Ahead of the ceremony in which Woods is to receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom, critics immediately pounced on Woods for having a past business relationship with Donald Trump. But these same critics seemingly ignored the fact that Woods completed one of the greatest career comebacks in sports history by winning the Masters Tournament a month ago.
According to Fox News , several journalists and social media and various publications took Woods to task for previously partnering with the Trump business empire, which arguably may have contributed to Woods not criticizing the president upon his election in 2016. From the way The New York Times put it, Woods has been a protege of Trump's since the late 1990s.
Since then, Mr. Trump has named a villa after him at the Trump National Doral Miami. He has also gone into business abroad with Mr. Woods, announcing in 2014 that the golfer would design a course in Dubai as part of a luxury residential megaproject that would be managed by the Trump Organization.
On Monday, Mr. Trump is set to once again seize Mr. Woods’s moment. At the White House, he will present Mr. Woods with the Presidential Medal of Freedom in honor of his Masters victory last month, a stunning personal comeback that put him back on top of the sports world at age 43, after a decade-long championship drought.
The Times report later went on to characterize Trump's award to Tiger Woods as a mix of ""hero worship and opportunism,"" suggesting that it may be a ploy to bring a prominent black athlete to the White House as other athletes (football and basketball players) have boycotted.
Of course, President Obama gave the Presidential Medal of Freedom Award to Oprah Winfrey, who was one of his biggest celebrity allies during the 2008 election. While Tiger Woods may indeed have been a business partner with Trump, he never actively campaigned on the president's behalf. Kyle C. Kopko, a professor at Elizabethtown College in Pennsylvania, claims that Obama's ties to Oprah pale in comparison to Trump and Woods.
""I can’t recall a business partner,"" Kopko told the Times. ""I can’t think of something like this, where Tiger is designing a golf course for Trump. I can’t think of another parallel.""
Tiger Woods took flack from leftists in 2018 when he urged people to respect the office of the president, as noted by Fox News.
""He's the president of the United States. You have to respect the office. No matter who is in the office, you may like, dislike personality or the politics, but we all must respect the office,"" Woods said at the time , earning the ire of ESPN commentator Max Kellerman.
""Well, I’ve known Donald for a number of years,"" Woods added at the time. ""We've played golf together. We've had dinner together. I've known him pre-presidency and obviously during his presidency.""
In response to the attacks, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said that the president honored Woods due to his athletic pedigree.
""The president thinks Tiger is not only a tremendous athlete but also has a great comeback story,"" said Sanders. ""He is undisputed as one of the great golfers in history and has broken barriers in the game."" "
"Kamala Harris Refuses To Accept Election Results In Florida, Georgia | Daily Wire",www.dailywire.com,Ashe Schow,05-06-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46820/kamala-harris-refuses-accept-election-results-ashe-schow,"Kamala Harris Refuses To Accept Election Results In Florida, Georgia Ethan Miller/Getty Images May 6, 2019 views
Just as in 2016, Democrats and their media supporters are suggesting President Donald Trump may not accept the results of the 2020 election. At the same time, these same people are ignoring that it is actually Democrats who are refusing to accept election results.
In early April, Rolling Stone published an article asking, “Will Trump Accept the Results of the 2020 Election?” On Saturday, The New York Times published an interview with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) where she warned Democrats they needed to win decisively in 2020 so Trump couldn’t challenge the results.
But as Democrats and the media suggest Trump will not accept the results of an election he loses, politicians on the Left actually aren’t accepting the results of elections they lose.
During her speech to the Detroit, Michigan, chapter of the NAACP, 2020 presidential candidate Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) claimed that voter suppression led to Democrat losses in Florida and Georgia in 2018, echoing the claims of the two candidates who lost those races.
“Let’s say this loud and clear – without voter suppression, Stacey Abrams would be the governor of Georgia, Andrew Gillum is the governor of Florida. So, the truth is, we need a new Voting Rights Act.” Sen. @KamalaHarris speaks to Detroit @NAACP : ""Let's say this loud and clear -- without voter suppression, @StaceyAbrams would be the governor of Georgia, @AndrewGillum is the governor of Florida. So the truth is we need a new Voting Rights Act."" pic.twitter.com/j37Rjkhcmb — The Hill (@thehill) May 6, 2019
Each of these candidates have refused to concede their elections. Abrams is on a countrywide tour claiming she actually won. Just last week she told an audience that she refuses to concede. In that same speech, she also bragged about increasing Democrat turnout, so it’s hard to see how she still gets away with the absurd claim that voters were suppressed.
""I won because we transformed the electorate, we turned out people who had never voted, we outmatched every Democrat in Georgia history,"" Abrams said.
She did not win but she did transform the electorate. The number of people who voted in the 2018 Georgia gubernatorial race was double the number who voted in the same race in 2014.
Abrams lost and simply refuses to accept it.
Gillum hasn’t been on a U.S. whining tour like Abrams, but he did tell HBO “Real Time” host Bill Maher back in March that votes weren’t counted in Florida.
“Had we been able to legally count every one of those votes not just in Florida but in Georgia, I wonder what the outcome may be,” he claimed.
As The Daily Wire previously reported, Democrats aren’t calling the Florida election illegitimate, even if Gillum does.
And we can’t forget that Hillary Clinton still refuses to accept she lost the 2016 presidential race because she was a bad candidate. She has blamed everyone and everything from racism, sexism, Russians, former FBI Director James Comey, and more for why Trump won over her. She simply can’t accept that she ran a bad campaign that assumed she’d win all the states that voted for President Barack Obama and ignored activists on the ground warning her they needed more resources.
Clinton set the tone for the Democrat Party in 2016, and others have just been following suit since then. Maybe Trump will refuse to accept a loss in 2020, but we can pretty much guarantee that Democrats will refuse to accept the results if and when they lose next year. "
Trump: Mueller Should Not Testify | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,James Barrett,05-06-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46810/trump-mueller-should-not-testify-james-barrett,"May 6, 2019 views
Amid reports Sunday that Democratic Judiciary Committee members are attempting to schedule Special Counsel Robert Mueller to testify on May 15, President Trump offered his unequivocal opinion on the issue: ""Bob Mueller should not testify,"" the president tweeted Sunday. ""No redos for the Dems!""
As Politico noted Sunday, Democratic Judiciary Committee member Rep. David Cicilline (RI) told ""Fox News Sunday"" that the committee has tentatively scheduled Mueller to testify on May 15; the congressman later issued a clarification on Twitter. ""Just to clarify: we are aiming to bring Mueller in on the 15th, but nothing has been agreed to yet,"" wrote Cicilline on Sunday. ""That’s the date the Committee has proposed, and we hope the Special Counsel will agree to it. Sorry for the confusion.""

Sorry for the confusion. https://t.co/FfR8ReLmkp — David Cicilline (@davidcicilline) May 5, 2019
Politico notes that the chairman of the committee, Democratic Rep. Jerry Nadler (NY), has also said that the committee is trying to schedule Mueller to testify on May 15.
While the White House has said that they will not attempt to prevent Mueller's testimony, Trump took the Twitter to express his disapproval of Democrats trying to get ""redos"" on the special counsel's final report.
""After spending more than $35,000,000 over a two year period, interviewing 500 people, using 18 Trump Hating Angry Democrats & 49 FBI Agents — all culminating in a more than 400 page Report showing NO COLLUSION - why would the Democrats in Congress now need Robert Mueller to testify,"" he said in a series of Mueller-themed tweets (tweets below). ""Are they looking for a redo because they hated seeing the strong NO COLLUSION conclusion? There was no crime, except on the other side (incredibly not covered in the Report), and NO OBSTRUCTION. Bob Mueller should not testify. No redos for the Dems!""
Politico suggests that if Trump's tweet is ""interpreted by the attorney general as a direct order to stifle Mueller’s testimony,"" it ""could set up the most consequential legal question related to the special counsel’s probe: whether executive privilege can be used to stop an executive branch employee from testifying about an investigation into the president.""
A few hours later, Trump posted some more Mueller-related tweets, comparing Mueller to fired FBI Director James Comey, slamming the Democrats' use of their committees as ""bullying"" their opponents, and highlighting the role Comey played in helping to get the Russia collusion investigation rolling.
Quoting former Whitewater independent counsel Robert Ray, Trump tweeted: ""The Report sounded an awful lot as being Comeyesque, in other words, I’m not going to charge this person (there wasn’t even close to being a crime), but I’m going to criticize him on the way out the door. That’s unfortunate because it’s stepping outside of the role.""
He followed up that quote with another by The Wall Street Journal's Jason Riley: ""This is not Congressional Oversight, this is bullying.""
Trump then retweeted a post by Republican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel, who wrote: ""Comey’s FBI sent undercover agents to spy on @realDonaldTrump’s campaign. It’s a stunning revelation of the lengths the Obama administration went. Instead of a phony Russia collusion investigation, we actually need to investigate how this whole hoax started.""
Trump continued to slam the Democrats' ""obstruction"" impeachment strategy on Monday morning, quoting One America News Network: ""'Democrat Texas Congressman Al Green says impeachment is the only thing that can prevent President Trump from re-election in 2020.'"" Trump added: ""In other words, Dems can’t win the election fairly. You can’t impeach a president for creating the best economy in our country’s history....Also, there are 'No High Crimes & Misdemeanors,' No Collusion, No Conspiracy, No Obstruction. ALL THE CRIMES ARE ON THE OTHER SIDE, and that’s what the Dems should be looking at, but they won’t. Nevertheless, the tables are turning!""

On Sunday, Schneider went on another tirade against Facebook for booting several far-right figures from the platform, such as Alex Jones and Milo Yiannopoulos. The ban also included one far-left figure, Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan.
""Free Speech is ALL SPEECH! The UK and Australia don’t have protected speech. And we are not protecting our 1st Amendment. #EternalVigilance,"" Schneider tweeted. Free Speech is ALL SPEECH!

Ironically, Schneider quoted far-left professor Noam Chomsky to illustrate his point about free speech and censorship. ""As America’s greatest linguist Noam Chomsky says,’Free Speech is ALL SPEECH.

Schneider experienced his intellectual departure from the Democratic Party several years ago and has been seemingly waging a war on destructive political correctness ever since. In April of last year, he took his former stomping grounds of ""Saturday Night Live"" to task for ruining the show with leftist politics .
""The fun of 'Saturday Night Live' was always you never knew which way they leaned politically,"" Schneider told the New York Daily News at the time. ""You kind of assumed they would lean more left and liberal, but now the cat's out of the bag they are completely against Trump, which I think makes it less interesting because you know the direction the piece is going.""
Schneider also took aim at Alec Baldwin's current portrayal of President Trump in comparison to his former co-star Dana Carvey's portrayal of President George H.W. Bush. Beneath the satire, according to Schneider, the latter showed affection for the president while the former only has disdain.
""Carvey played it respectfully,"" Schneider said. ""To me, the genius of Dana Carvey was Dana always had empathy for the people he played, and Alec Baldwin has nothing but a fuming, seething anger toward the person he plays.""
For that reason, Schneider says Baldwin is ""hard to watch"" because his motives are just too obvious. ""Alec Baldwin is a brilliant actor… he's not a comedian,"" Schneider flatly shared. "
"Code Pink Leftists Take Over Venezuelan Embassy In Washington, D.C., Taunt Actual Venezuelans | Daily Wire",www.dailywire.com,Emily Zanotti,05-06-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46841/leftists-take-over-venezuelan-embassy-washington-emily-zanotti,"Code Pink Leftists Take Over Venezuelan Embassy In Washington, D.C., Taunt Actual Venezuelans Photo Credit: SAUL LOEB/AFP/Getty Images May 6, 2019 views
A group of around 50 leftists, organized by the far-left, pro-Communist organization, Code Pink, has taken up residence in the Venezuelan embassy in Washington, D.C., in order to ""prevent"" the new Venezuelan government from taking over from Nicolas Maduro's team of diplomats, who vacated the embassy last month.
Towards the end of last week and over the weekend, Venezuelans who support opposition leader Juan Guaido, also began protesting around the embassy in an effort to educate the mostly white, uniformly American demonstrators inside on the realities of Maduro's dictatorship.
The Code Pink protesters were, reportedly, not amused.
The dueling protests have clashed, sometimes violently, since Thursday of last week, when the pro-opposition protesters joined together to form a human chain around the Venezuelan embassy, preventing new Code Pink and pro-Communist occupiers from entering the building, and blocking deliveries of food. Fox News reports that the Code Pink-ers retaliated by playing pro-Communist anthems, screaming taunts into bullhorns, and sitting down in front of the Venezuelans.
The Code Pink group, led by longtime leftist stalwart Medea Benjamin, says they have no plans to leave until the embassy has returned to Maduro's hands, and that they have permission from the Maduro government to remain inside. Officials tied to the Maduro government have even provided them keycards and security codes for the building.
“We feel that the elected government and the government that holds power and the government that’s recognized by the United Nations is the Maduro government, and they deserve to have their embassy here,” Benjamin told Fox News in an interview late last week. “That’s why we’ve been here.”
Photos of Benjamin's cohorts show a mostly non-Venezuelan crew , and the Venezuelan protesters have noticed, often referring to the Code Pink protesters as ""occupiers,"" according to one reporter from Vox who spent the day at the protest last week.
""We're doing our part from wherever we are around the world to bring light into the Venezuelan plight. And there's invaders in our embassy that are not Venezuelans,"" one pro-Venezuelan protester even told CNN . ""This is the Venezuelan people for Venezuelan democracy; this is not about right or left in the world. I hope and I beg that people don't use my country and the suffering of my people for their own personal flags that have nothing to do with what's going on.""
Occasionally, Benjamin and others, including Code Pink co-president Ariel Gold, will try to ""educate"" the Venezuelan ex-pats — an effort that often results in embarrassing confrontations like the one captured by Vox Media, in which an elderly, white, American protester attempts to explain Venezuela to a Venezuelan.

Other pro-Communist protesters have tried doing public relations for Maduro. Kevin Zeese, the 63-year-old career leftist in charge of the pro-Maduro group, ""Popular Resistance,"" explained to Vox's reporter (while clad in a Hugo Chavez tee shirt that read, ""Chauvistas"") that Maduro is not a dictator and that he had friend who had visited the country and found only limited poverty.
Over the weekend, pro-Venezuelan protesters tried fighting back against the taunts by reading aloud a list of people killed by Maduro's regime.
The State Department called Benjamin's crew, ""trespassers,"" but admitted that they can't remove the group by force since the embassy is technically Venezuelan territory.

A new report from The Daily Caller claims that the city of Flint, Michigan, which has suffered from a headline-commanding water crisis for half a decade, may have steered tens of millions in aid money meant to help replace lead water pipes to a contractor that had no experience, but who did have a close relationship with Flint city officials.
The controversy may go straight to the top: to the Flint mayor's office.
The Caller reports that $22 million in ""water crisis aid"" was directed to a company with ties to city officials, even though that company didn't have experience replacing leaded water pipes — what the aid money was meant to help do.
Administrators in charge of the project also ignored cost-saving models that would have allowed water replacement companies to test for older pipes before digging up huge swaths of land, opting instead to follow a plan that had contractors digging up yard after yard to replace water pipes, even if they found copper or new piping underground.
""The city prohibited contractors from using an efficient method of digging holes known as hydrovac excavation,"" a Flint councilwoman told the Caller. ""That leveled the playing field for a contractor, WT Stevens, with no experience or the appropriate equipment — and let it bill far more to taxpayers, she says. All of these factors, [the councilwoman] adds, needlessly led to more waiting for anyone who actually has lead pipes.""
They ""chose to dig up yards that they knew were copper, and they decided to hand dig instead of hydrovac,” the councilwoman said. ""That was because WT Stevens didn’t have the ability, and you get more money [digging by hand]. It costs $250 [to hydrovac] versus thousands to dig a large hole without the equipment.""
Flint's mayor, Karen Weaver, and one key Flint city councilman, Eric Mays, both appear to have cozy relationships with WT Stevens, and supported the contractor even when the work looked shoddy. The pair were also behind the decision to dig up every yard looking for lead pipes, even though a University of Michigan study was able to predict where the problematic lead pipes were with stunning 94% accuracy.
The ""predictive model"" could be extrapolated, Flint clean water activists said, but WT Stevens dug up areas where there were no predicted lead pipes in ""exploratory"" projects.
This latest revelation is one of just a handful of discoveries that have called aspects of the nearly billion-dollar Flint clean water rescue program into question. Flint's water systems had a lead problem that came to light when state administrators made the decision to shift Flint from the costly Detroit water system to a cheaper local system in an effort to save the city from descending into bankruptcy. Once the shifts began to occur, authorities discovered that Flint's infrastructure had been completely neglected for decades, leaving Flint citizens exposed to dangerous levels of lead in their drinking water.
Since then, state and federal officials estimate that more than half a billion dollars has been allocated to alleviate Flint's water issues, but that a great deal of that money has been mismanaged. Besides the $22 million in pipe replacement contracts and a similarly mismanaged wastewater contract, a whistleblower lawsuit is currently making its way through federal court, alleging that Flint's mayor, Karen Weaver, diverted money meant to help Flint's citizens to her campaign coffers.
Flint's water has been safe to drink since early 2017 , according to the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, and the amount of lead in the water has continued to fall to where it is now well below levels considered ""safe"" by the federal government and the National Resources Defense Council.

Socialist Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) embarrassed herself on Monday after she tried to attack Sen. Rick Scott's (R-FL) ""critical thinking"" abilities over comments Scott made but was unable to understand that Scott was being sarcastic.
Scott weighed in on Democrat presidential candidate Cory Booker saying that he wanted to create a federal gun licensing system.
""BREAKING: the latest terrible idea to come out of the Democrats' 2020 primary is a federal gun registry,"" Scott tweeted. ""If you want to buy a gun, @CoryBooker wants you to register with the federal government. This would be scary if Booker had any chance of becoming President.""
""What's next? Will we have to register sharp knives? Maybe @AOC will make us register every time we buy meat as part of her #GreenNewDeal,"" Scott continued. ""The Democrats are officially the @BernieSanders Party. They want America to be less prosperous and less free."" What's next? Will we have to register sharp knives?

Ocasio-Cortez responded by tweeting: ""That a sitting US Senator can say something lacking so much critical thinking + honesty is embarrassing to the institution. If you were a female candidate, maybe you’d be called 'unlikeable,' 'crazy,' or 'uninformed.' But since you’re not, this inadequacy is accepted as normal.""

Scott responded: ""That a sitting Congresswoman doesn’t understand sarcasm would be embarrassing to the institution if you hadn’t embarrassed yours to the point of irrelevance already.

Scott's statement that America rejects socialism is accurate according to a new Monmouth University Poll poll released Monday.
""A majority of Americans say socialism is incompatible with American values, and only 10% of voters in a new poll have a positive view of socialism,"" The Hill reported, adding that the poll found that ""57% of voters believe that socialism is incompatible with American values.""

Poll: It's Clearly Biden Vs. Trump In 2020 | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Hank Berrien,05-06-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46855/poll-its-clearly-biden-vs-trump-2020-hank-berrien,"Poll: It's Clearly Biden Vs. Trump In 2020 Biden blowing out other contenders Angela Rowlings/MediaNews Group/Boston Herald via Getty Images May 6, 2019 views
It’s looking like it will be former Vice President Joe Biden who will face-off against President Trump in 2020, if a new poll is an accurate reflection of Democratic voters.
A Hill-Harris poll released on Monday showed Biden with a whopping 32-point lead over the second-place finisher, Senator Bernie Sanders, 46% to 14%. Former South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg was in third place at 8%; Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) garnered 7%. Mallory Newall, the director of research at Ipsos Public Affairs, commented, ""Biden has seen a little bit of a bump from his announcement, anywhere from 12 to 15 percentage points in most polls that I've seen. I think his standing is strong at this point but again, you have to keep in mind that he is by far the best known in the race.""
As The Hill noted, “Polls taken since the former vice president's official declaration have shown him receiving support in the upper 30s to lower 40s, about twice as much as Sanders, his next closest rival.”
The rest of the field: California Democratic Sen. Kamala Harris (6%), former Rep. Beto O'Rourke (D-TX) and Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) with 3% each; Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI), former HUD secretary Julian Castro , former Rep. John Delaney (D-MD), Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), and Sen. Michael Bennet (D-CO) all received 2% or lower.
No other candidate received more than 1%.
Two candidates who seemed to be catching fire early in the campaign, Harris and O’Rourke, have faltered badly. As The Daily Wire reported Monday:
A new poll of Iowa, New Hampshire & South Carolina Democratic primary voters reveals that erstwhile leading candidates Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) and former Congressman Beto O’Rourke (D-TX) lag far behind numerous other candidates.
The Firehouse-Optimus poll found that in Iowa, Harris garnered only 4.9% of the vote, with O’Rourke trailing her at 2.7%. The two candidates fell far behind former Vice President Joe Biden, at 34.9%, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) at 13.7%, Pete Buttigieg, at 11.4%, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, with 10.4%.
In New Hampshire, Biden got 34.%, Sanders 15.5%, Buttigieg 9.7%, Warren 9.1%. Harris 7.0%, and O’Rourke 3.0%. In South Carolina, Biden garnered 48.3%, Sanders 11.9%, Buttigieg 5.2%, Warren 4.5%. Harris 4.3%, and O’Rourke 1.2%.
Biden’s numbers seem to be holding up despite various hits he has taken recently, including his son Hunter’s alleged connection to a Ukrainian political corruption scandal, of which The New York Times reported that new information showed “how Hunter Biden and his American business partners were part of a broad effort by Burisma to bring in well-connected Democrats during a period when the company was facing investigations backed not just by domestic Ukrainian forces but by officials in the Obama administration.""
Other hits: reports that Biden’s staffers were reportedly physically blocking off reporters from covering the Democrat on the 2020 campaign trail, presumably at the candidate’s directive, as The Daily Wire reported. Another : a racially-charged clip of Biden from 2007 discussing condom use in the black community and AIDS testing. "
GA Governor Signing ‘Heartbeat Bill’ : I’m Not Worried About What Hollywood Thinks Of Me | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Hank Berrien,05-06-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46849/ga-governor-signing-heartbeat-bill-im-not-worried-hank-berrien,"May 6, 2019 views
On Tuesday, despite the specter of Hollywood actors pushing for a boycott, Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp will sign the ""heartbeat"" abortion bill, according to Fox News .
Kemp told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution (AJC), ""I can't govern because I'm worried about what someone in Hollywood thinks about me. I ran the last two years on these issues, and I got elected with the largest number of votes in the history of the state of Georgia, and I'm doing what I told people I would do … Our business environment’s good. We cannot change our values of who we are for money. And we’re not going to do that. That’s what makes our state great.""
Staci Fox of Planned Parenthood Southeast told AJC, “We warned them - we will see you in court, Governor Kemp. And we are coming for their seats.”
AJC noted that Georgia hosted 455 productions last fiscal year, generating $9.5 billion in economic impact and $2.7 billion in direct spending.
The “heartbeat bill,” H.B. 481, states that the “full value of a child begins when a heartbeat exists”; requires “physicians performing abortions to determine the existence of a detectable human heartbeat before performing an abortion,” states “it shall be the policy of the State of Georgia to recognize unborn children as natural persons,” and asserts “unless otherwise provided by law, any natural person, including an unborn child with a detectable human heartbeat, shall be included in population based determinations.”
As The Daily Wire reported in late March, 50 actors who fancied themselves paragons of morality sent a letter written by abortion advocate Alyssa Milano to Georgia House Speaker David Ralston and Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp threatening the state of Georgia with a boycott if the state passed H.B. 481, the Living Infants Fairness and Equality (LIFE) Act, also known as the “heartbeat bill.”
The letter stated:
As actors, our work often brings us to Georgia. We’ve always found your state to be populated with friendly and caring people. We’ve found the hotels in which we stay and restaurants in which we dine while filming there to be comfortable and of a high quality. We’ve been glad to bring millions of dollars in revenue to support Georgia’s schools, parks and communities. But we cannot in good conscience continue to recommend our industry remain in Georgia if H.B. 481 becomes law.
This dangerous and deeply-flawed bill mimics many others which have already been deemed unconstitutional. As men who identify as small-government conservatives, we remind you that government is never bigger than when it is inside a woman’s body or in her doctor’s office. This bill would remove the possibility of women receiving reproductive healthcare before most even know they are pregnant and force many women to undergo unregulated, hidden procedures at great risk to their health.
We can’t imagine being elected officials who had to say to their constituents, “I enacted a law that was so evil, it chased billions of dollars out of our state’s economy.” It’s not the most effective campaign slogan, but rest assured we’ll make it yours should it come to pass. This is the precipice on which you stand. We want to stay in Georgia. We want to continue to support the wonderful people, businesses and communities we have come to love in the Peach State. But we will not do so silently, and we will do everything in our power to move our industry to a safer state for women if H.B. 481 becomes law. You have a choice, gentlemen. We pray you make the right one. "
"NYT Editorial Board: 'Congress, Give Trump His Border Money' | Daily Wire",www.dailywire.com,James Barrett,05-06-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46851/nyt-editorial-board-congress-give-trump-his-border-james-barrett,"views
Yes, you read that right, but, no, The New York Times editorial board explicitly does not mean money for his ""big, beautiful"" wall. Nonetheless, the nation's left-leaning newspaper of record is conceding that not only is there a crisis at the southern border — as Trump has been hammering repeatedly and Democrats have been denying obstinately for months — it's so severe that the Times is actually calling for Democrats to put aside ""political gamesmanship"" and do the one thing they're most committed not to do: actually work with Trump to do something good for the country when it comes to illegal immigration.
""President Trump is right: There is a crisis at the southern border. Just not the one he rants about,"" the Times editorial board writes in an editorial published Sunday.
What is supposedly not happening at the border, according to the Times, is undocumented people secretly crossing over who pose a national security risk. There's ""no invasion of murderers, drug cartels or terrorists,"" the Times confidently underscores — though the nature of illegal immigration is that we do not know who has entered the country, and we do have a lot of evidence of drug cartels operating on the border. That said, the editorial board lays out the aspects of the crisis they are willing to admit is in fact happening:
But as record numbers of Central American families flee violence and poverty in their homelands, they are overwhelming United States border systems, fueling a humanitarian crisis of overcrowding, disease and chaos. The Border Patrol is now averaging 1,200 daily arrests, with many migrants arriving exhausted and sick. Last week, a teenage boy from Guatemala died in government custody, the third death of a minor since December. As resources are strained and the system buckles, the misery grows.
The ""misery"" has grown so intense and widereaching that our lawmakers must actually do something — and ""soon."" And what's blocking this action? Well, business as usual in Washington, the Times suggests: ""political gamesmanship once again threatens to hold up desperately needed resources.""
The Times then acknowledges that the Trump White House has issued a rather reasonable request of $4.5 billion for emergency funding to help manage what it aptly describes as a crisis caused by ""alarming numbers"" of migrants arriving at the southern border, in particular unaccompanied minors:
In a letter to lawmakers, the acting director of the White House’s budget office, Russell Vought, sought to convey the scope of the challenge. “In February, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) encountered more than 76,000 illegal border crossers and inadmissible aliens, and in March that number exceeded 100,000 — the highest monthly level in more than a decade,” Mr. Vought wrote. He described what he said were “alarming numbers” of women and children jammed into Border Patrol stations never intended as long-term shelters.
The Times faults the request for being ""light on specifics"" but notes that none if it goes to the wall and that it earmarks a majority of the funds, $3.3 billion, for humanitarian needs, specifically directing much of it to the agency that handles unaccompanied minors.
The only ""nonstarter""in the request for Democrats is the $700 million that goes to ""shoring up border security operations, including increasing the number of detention beds overseen by Immigration and Customs Enforcement."" The board expresses some sympathy with Democrats on the issue but suggests, ""until better policies are in place, Democrats need to find a way to provide money for adequate shelter."" "
