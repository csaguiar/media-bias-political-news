Barr: Mueller turned down offer to review Russia probe findings,www.politico.com,KYLE CHENEY,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/09/barr-testimony-mueller-report-1263383,"Attorney General William Barr rebuffed Democrats’ demands that he turn over Mueller's full report and all its underlying evidence to Congress, telling lawmakers on Tuesday that he’ll release a redacted version of the report “within a week.”
In his first public appearance since the conclusion of Mueller’s 22-month investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and whether President Donald Trump obstructed that probe, Barr defended his handling of the report against attacks from Democrats, who panned his four-page summary as an effort to protect Trump from damaging information contained within the report.
The attorney general also said lawmakers had no inherent authority to review Mueller’s sensitive grand jury evidence, adding that he does not intend to ask a court to authorize the release of grand jury evidence to Congress.
“My intention is not to ask for it at this stage,” he said, adding that he doesn’t believe Congress is exempt from grand jury secrecy rules under the law.
Democrats have called on Barr to make the full report, including all the grand jury material and underlying evidence gathered as part of the investigation, available to Congress. Barr on Tuesday said the House Judiciary Committee could ask a court for the grand jury information — something Democrats have not yet embraced.
Barr called the version he intends to release in the coming days a “first pass” and said he’ll work with House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) and his Senate counterpart, Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), if they want to view some of the redacted areas of the report.
Nadler fired back at Barr later Tuesday, saying it was “unfortunate” that he and Barr were unable to “reach an accommodation” that would allow Congress to view the full report.
“I suppose my conclusion is that he regards his job as working as an attorney for the president personally, not for the government,” Nadler told reporters.
Last week, the House Judiciary Committee authorized Nadler to issue a subpoena for the full Mueller report. Nadler has said he expects to use the subpoena in the coming days under the expectation that Barr will not provide the committee with enough information, but he wouldn’t commit to issuing it immediately on Tuesday.
During his testimony — which was ostensibly focused on the Justice Department’s budget — Barr said he was working with Mueller to identify sensitive information that should be redacted — including grand jury evidence, classified material and information relevant to ongoing investigations — before he submits the report. He said the process was “going along very well” and that he would explain using a color-coded system why each redaction was made.
“I do think it’s important that the public have an opportunity to learn the results of the special counsel’s work,” Barr said, noting that the special counsel regulations, as written, do not require him to make the report public.
Barr's testimony took on added urgency in light of recent news reports that members of Mueller’s team were frustrated with the attorney general’s summary, claiming it doesn’t accurately represent their investigation.
Barr acknowledged those frustrations, telling Rep. Charlie Crist (D-Fla.): “I suspect that they probably wanted more put out.”
The attorney general said he gave Mueller and his prosecutors an opportunity to review his four-page summary of the report before it was released to the public last month. Barr said Mueller declined to review it in advance.
Under subsequent questioning from Rep. Tom Graves (R-Ga.), Barr mused hypothetically about a leak of the report from Mueller’s team to Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee — but he called such a prospect unlikely.
“I doubt that would happen,” he said.
Barr bristled when he was pressed for additional details by Rep. Nita Lowey (D-N.Y.). Asked whether the White House had been briefed on any aspect of the report, Barr said: “I’ve said what I’m going to say about the report today.”
“I’ve already laid out the process going forward to release these reports hopefully within a week,” he said. “I’m not going to say anything more about it until the report is out.”
Barr is slated to testify before the House and Senate judiciary panels in early May about his handling of the Mueller report.
In the four-page summary he issued last month, Barr wrote that Mueller “did not establish” that the Trump campaign conspired with Russians to influence the 2016 presidential election.
Though Barr noted that Mueller made no decision on whether to charge Trump with obstructing the investigation, the attorney general, in his four-page memo, revealed his own decision to absolve Trump of any allegations of obstruction, prompting howls from Democrats that the move was an effort to whitewash damaging information Mueller might have uncovered about the president.
Democrats leaned heavily into Barr’s decision-making process in crafting the summary.
Lowey, chairwoman of the Appropriations Committee, used her opening statement to home in on what she called Barr’s “unacceptable handling” of the report.
“All we have is your four-page summary letter, which seems to cherry pick from the report to draw the most favorable conclusion possible for the president,” Lowey said.
Barr also addressed a GOP-led effort to investigate the origins of the FBI’s Russia investigation, which Mueller later inherited.
Republicans have long claimed that the FBI relied on Clinton campaign opposition research to win approval of a surveillance warrant on a former adviser to Trump’s campaign. The FBI has rejected that assertion, noting that a controversial dossier — shared with the FBI by a former British spy who had been retained by a firm hired by the Clinton campaign — was just one piece of evidence used to obtain the warrant and that it had mentioned his bias in the application.
Barr referenced an ongoing inspector-general investigation into the surveillance effort that could be finished by May or June. He also said he was wraping his arms around the controversy and that he’s awaiting criminal referrals from the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, Devin Nunes of California, who said Sunday that he intends to pass along eight such referrals to the Justice Department.
Graham, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, also plans to launch his own probe that will center on the possibility of anti-Trump bias at the Justice Department and the FBI.
At Tuesday’s hearing, Republicans lamented that Democrats were focusing on the Mueller report instead of the Justice Department’s budget request.
“I see so many of the questions here this morning have gone toward a grassy-knoll conspiracy theory regarding with the Mueller report,” said Rep. Robert Aderholt of Alabama, the top Republican on the Appropriations subcommittee.

BILL BARR says he will release the redacted Mueller report within a week . KYLE CHENEY and ANDREW DESIDERIO: “Barr told lawmakers during an appearance on Capitol Hill that he is working with [Robert] Mueller to identify sensitive information that should be redacted … before he submits the report.

-- Whether Barr meant it or not, this is fortuitous timing for the administration. Congress is out for the next two weeks for the Easter recess, which scatters PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP’S opposition. The House and Senate aren’t back until April 29!
-- WHAT DO WE THINK … Friday news dump? Sunday news dump? The Justice Department previously told reporters to expect the report sometime between Friday and next Tuesday.
DARREN SAMUELSOHN: “Judge denies request for speedy release of Mueller report”: “U.S. District Court Judge Reggie Walton said in his ruling from the bench that he understands the public clamor to see Mueller’s findings on Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. But he explained that the lawsuit filed by the Electronic Privacy and Information Center didn’t meet the threshold requirement for him to make such an extraordinary emergency move.” POLITICO
HOW DO YOU SAY ‘NO COLLUSION’ IN RUSSIAN? … “Putin says Mueller’s probe validates Russia on no collusion,” by AP’s Vladimir Isachenkov and Irina Titova in St. Petersburg
DETAILS … THE NEW IMMIGRATION CRACKDOWN … AXIOS’ JONATHAN SWAN and STEF KIGHT: “Trump’s hardline new border plan”: “President Trump has directed top officials to execute the most aggressive changes in immigration policy since his inauguration … Asked whether to expect an acceleration in deportations, a senior administration official, familiar with internal deliberations, said: ‘Yes, that’s the critical part of restoring integrity to the system.’ …
“The changes, outlined by the senior official: Make regulatory changes to make it ‘more difficult for low-skilled immigrants ... to gain admission’ into the United States, ‘and easier for high-skilled immigrants who are likely to be self-sufficient.’ … Make it more difficult for people to invoke their fear of returning to their home country in order to seek asylum in the U.S. …
“[T]he White House is frustrated by the granting of work permits to asylum seekers so soon after entering the country … The White House also wants to change rules to allow the government to detain migrant children for longer than the 20-day limit allowed under the so-called Flores agreement.” Axios
BUT, BUT, BUT … Asked about reports that he wants to reinstate family separation at the border, TRUMP this afternoon repeatedly told reporters that it was former President Barack Obama who began the practice and that Trump was “the one who stopped it.” When pressed on whether he wanted to bring it back, he said, “We’re not looking to do that.” But he also said, “Once you don’t have it, that’s why you have many more people coming.”

FACT CHECK -- NYT’S NEIL IRWIN and EMILY BADGER: “Trump Says the U.S. Is ‘Full.’ Much of the Nation Has the Opposite Problem”: “To the degree the president is addressing something broader than the recent strains on the asylum-seeking process, the line suggests the nation can’t accommodate higher immigration levels because it is already bursting at the seams. But it runs counter to the consensus among demographers and economists.
“They see ample evidence of a country that is not remotely ‘full’ — but one where an aging population and declining birthrates among the native-born population are creating underpopulated cities and towns, vacant housing and troubled public finances. Local officials in many of those places view a shrinking population and work force as an existential problem with few obvious solutions.” NYT

On Monday, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos encouraged the K-12 education chiefs to “continue to raise the bar.""
— Former ""Desperate Housewives"" star Felicity Huffman apologized for her role in a sweeping admissions cheating and bribery scandal . She and 13 others will plead guilty, the Justice Department announced.
— A decade after the start of the Great Recession, state funding for higher education has only recovered halfway. That’s according to the latest report by the State Higher Education Executive Officers Association.
IT’S TUESDAY. Got news to share? Drop me a line at ngaudiano@politico.com .
Driving the Day TALKING K-12: The Education secretary took a more conciliatory tone with K-12 education chiefs on Monday, a year after taking them to task for the quality of their state plans under ESSA.
— DeVos told the Council of Chief State School Officers that her department would look favorably on requests for waivers designed to increase expectations for student achievement and “set the bar higher for those with whom you work.”
— “On the other end of the spectrum, if it’s a request to obfuscate or put off something you should be doing today for students, that will not be as well received,” she said. “We have to continue to raise the bar and have expectations that are continually setting our sights on what the next level of achievement might be.”
— One of DeVos’ top deputies, Frank Brogan, who leads the Office of Elementary and Secondary Education, will talk about ESSA implementation today at The National Association of State Boards of Education’s legislative conference.
— Meanwhile, CCSSO will hear from an all-star lineup of lawmakers today. Senate HELP Chairman Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) will tell the group that he and House education leader Bobby Scott (D-Va.) “share an interest” in ensuring states are “holding schools accountable” and fully complying with ESSA, according to a preview of his remarks. “This is an important year because we will start to really see the fruit of the work you all are doing,” he plans to say.
HIGHER EDUCATION HUFFMAN APOLOGIZES: The actress said in a statement she's “ashamed” after authorities revealed she agreed to pay at least $15,000 to arrange college entrance exam cheating for her oldest daughter. The charges of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud, to which Huffman will plead guilty, carry a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, three years of supervised release and a fine of at least $250,000.
— ""I am ashamed of the pain I have caused my daughter , my family, my friends, my colleagues and the educational community,"" she said Monday. ""I want to apologize to them and, especially, I want to apologize to the students who work hard every day to get into college, and to their parents who make tremendous sacrifices to support their children and do so honestly.""
— The scheme involved bribing coaches and college administrators — with about $25 million in payments over seven years — and paying off college entrance exam administrators to allow students to cheat on their tests. A dozen other parents will also plead guilty, as will the former head coach of men's tennis at the University of Texas at Austin, who personally accepted $60,000 in cash and another $40,000 directed to the UT tennis program in bribes to designate an applicant as a recruited athlete. Benjamin Wermund has more .
STATE NEWS STATE HIGHER ED FUNDING SLOW TO RECOVER: A decade after the start of the Great Recession, state funding for higher education has only recovered halfway, according to a report out today by the State Higher Education Executive Officers Association. At the same time, a growing reliance on tuition remains at a near high, the study said.
— Funding fell more than $2,000 per student during the recession — and was still about $1,000 below pre-recession levels by 2018 , per the report, which said appropriations for higher education averaged $7,853 per student last year.
— Despite that, state financial aid for students at public institutions has increased for four straight years and 2018 saw an 8.7 percent increase in state aid — the largest since the Great Recession. State aid per full-time students reached an all-time high of $752, nearly 10 percent of all appropriations, according to the report.
— Tuition revenue, meanwhile, was flat in 2018 , the first time since the Great Recession that net tuition revenue did not significantly exceed inflation rates. Tuition revenue has risen in all but two of the last 25 years. Among the possible reasons for the stagnation, according to the report: Declining international student enrollment.
School Safety PRINCIPALS CONNECT TO HELP PEERS IN SCHOOL SHOOTING AFTERMATH: The National Association of Secondary School Principals formed a new network consisting of principals who have experienced a shooting at their school. The goal is for participants to be a comfort and resource to other principals who experience a similar incident. The involved principals seek to “share their aggregated knowledge immediately with colleagues in crisis” and advocate for the “needs of schools both to prevent shootings and help schools recover from them,” NASSP said in a press release.
— NASSP said an initial group of principals from 87 different school shootings since 2013 that form the network met earlier this month in Reston, Va., at NASSP’s headquarters. The network includes Ty Thompson, principal at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., where 17 died last year, and Jake Heibel, principal of Great Mills High School in Great Mills, Md., where one student was fatally shot last year.
K-12 GROUPS SPOTLIGHT SCHOOL INTEGRATION: The National Coalition on School Diversity and The Century Foundation will hold a briefing today on how all levels of government can support school integration. Speakers include American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten.
— The Century Foundation, a progressive think tank, is calling for a host of school integration policies in a new report that argues the federal government has failed to adequately support school diversity in recent decades, directly contributing to rising racial and income segregation in public schools.
— Among the policies the report promotes are the Strength in Diversity Act — legislation that would provide $120 million in competitive grants to districts to reduce segregation — and a boost in Title 1 funding levels for voluntary school integration efforts. The report also calls for enacting a federal pre-clearance requirement to review efforts by “wealthier and whiter districts” to secede from integrated school districts and ending the prohibition on using federal funds to transport students for integration.
REPORT ROLL CALL — Chiefs for Change, a bipartisan network of state and district education leaders, has a a new report that provides a detailed, state-by-state analysis of inequities in education leadership and outlines solutions to help more women, and women of color in particular, become district superintendents and state chiefs.

Mexico on track to pass labor reform required in USMCA,www.politico.com,politico.com,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-trade/2019/04/09/mexico-on-track-to-pass-labor-reform-required-in-usmca-422812,"With help from Adam Behsudi, Doug Palmer and Megan Cassella
QUICK FIX Mexico is poised to pass major labor reform this month, removing one of the roadblocks that House Democrats have said is an obstacle to congressional consideration of the new North American trade pact.
— Mexican tomato growers offered the Commerce Department a proposal for a new agreement with the U.S. that would raise the price floor for selling tomatoes in the United States.
— Canada is preparing to refresh its list of U.S. products facing retaliatory tariffs as it continues to press for the U.S. to drop its steel and aluminum tariffs.
IT'S TUESDAY, APRIL 9! recommends everyone listen to the Peterson Institute for International Economics’ Trade Talks podcast this week to hear more about Mexico’s history of trade. Know of any podcasts I should be listening to? Have trade news to share? Let me know: srodriguez@politico.com or @sabrod123 .
Driving the Day MEXICO ON TRACK TO PASS LABOR LAW REQUIRED IN USMCA: Mexico is expected to pass a major labor reform law later this month that would check off one of its commitments under the replacement deal for NAFTA.
The labor changes would partially remove one of the roadblocks House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has said is stopping Congress from considering the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement. The labor law would completely overhaul the country’s existing union structure, which has long been criticized for failing to protect workers.
Celeste Drake, trade policy specialist for the AFL-CIO, said Mexico’s latest draft bill “is an improvement and meets a key criteria of ensuring workers can vote on their collective bargaining agreements.”
AMLO’s plan: Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador and his administration have repeatedly said Mexico would deliver on its promise to overhaul workers’ rights regulations, as it is a domestic policy priority for the left-leaning populist.
“There’s a coincidence of opinion with López Obrador and the Democrats in U.S. on this — in the sense of wanting to strengthen the protection of workers’ rights,” Kenneth Smith Ramos, chief NAFTA negotiator under former Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto, told POLITICO.
Not so fast: Speaker Nancy Pelosi has said lawmakers will need to see how Mexico implements the new labor law before they consider USMCA.
Sen. Sherrod Brown , another Democrat closely following the deal, agrees with Pelosi “that both enactment and implementation of labor law reforms that comply with the standards outlined in the agreement are necessary before Congress should consider the new NAFTA,” one of his staffers told POLITICO.

MEXICAN TOMATO INDUSTRY LOOKS FOR COMPROMISE: The Mexican tomato industry has offered a proposal that would significantly raise the price floor on its tomatoes sold in the U.S., an attorney representing the growers said Monday. The push for a new deal comes as Mexican growers look to avoid restarting an anti-dumping probe that could result in steep duties on their tomatoes.
""What we're hoping is the new proposal, which we've put to the Commerce Department, is received well by them and by Florida. We think it's extremely strong,” said Bob LaRussa, an attorney with Shearman and Sterling, who is representing the Mexican growers.
If both sides reach a deal, it would replace a six-year-old “suspension” agreement that Commerce would withdraw from on May 7. But Mexican growers are prepared to fight the issue before the International Trade Commission if Commerce is not willing to agree to a fair deal, LaRussa said.
Florida growers react: Florida Tomato Exchange welcomed the Mexican proposal, saying it “contains some useful suggestions on how to prevent circumvention of the suspension agreement by Mexican producers.”

COMPANY SEEKS 30 PERCENT TITANIUM SPONGE PRICE INCREASE: The company behind the Commerce Department’s latest Section 232 import investigation wants the Trump administration to negotiate a “collaborative” agreement with Japan to raise the price of titanium sponge by roughly 30 percent. Titanium Metals Corp., also known as TIMET, filed its petition with Commerce last year but only made it public on Monday afternoon. Titanium sponge is used to make titanium used in a number of high-tech and military applications.
“TIMET believes America’s titanium sponge industry can be put on sound economic footing again by restoring prices for titanium sponge to 2013 levels, which were about 30% above current levels,” the company said in its brief. “Those price levels allowed TIMET and [Allegheny Technologies Inc.], as well as Japanese producers, to operate their titanium sponge plants at a sustainable cost that encouraged reinvestment in the titanium sponge industry. A combination of bilateral agreements, tariffs and quotas can achieve sustainable economics.”
CANADA TO REFRESH PRODUCTS FACING RETALIATION OVER U.S. STEEL TARIFFS: Canadian officials will soon change the list of U.S. products facing tariffs in retaliation for U.S. duties on steel and aluminum, Canadian Ambassador to the U.S. David MacNaughton said Monday.
Coming soon: MacNaughton said the retaliation list will be refreshed “shortly” and will likely be released within the next week. He added there “are no negotiations at the present moment” to resolve the dispute over the Section 232 tariffs.
It’s the latest sign that the Trump administration is not close to lifting its tariffs on steel and aluminum from Mexico and Canada. A number of lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have told President Donald Trump that lifting the tariffs is necessary to get USMCA through Congress.
Refresher: Canada imposed retaliatory tariffs on nearly $12.5 billion worth of U.S. goods in July in response to Trump’s tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum in the name of national security. Mexico has also discussed changing the items on its retaliation list, but officials have not announced a date to update those countermeasures, which hit roughly $3 billion worth of U.S. goods. More here .
GRASSLEY BEATS HIS 232 DRUM: The chairman of the Senate Finance Committee took to the floor on Monday afternoon to publicly urge Trump to lift the steel and aluminum tariffs against Canada and Mexico to clear the way for the USMCA.
Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) called for a resolution that “would acknowledge that we need our allies to help us deal with the source of the overcapacity problems. And that source of the problem is China.”
Doing so would allow Congress to “forge ahead” with the USMCA, Grassley said, adding the deal needs to be approved this year.
WHITE HOUSE OFFICIAL POSITIVE ABOUT PROSPECTS FOR EU TALKS: The U.S. and European Union will see “momentum” in potential trade talks in the coming year, outgoing White House trade adviser Clete Willems said Monday at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. “I absolutely think something very positive can be accomplished this year,” he said.
Even though Brussels and Washington are hung up on the inclusion of agriculture in the talks and the U.S. continues to dangle the threat of auto tariffs, Willems said the two sides have maintained a constructive agenda when it comes to future EU purchases of natural gas and soybeans. Confronting China and addressing WTO reform are also constructive areas, he said.
Still, the senior official recognized political headwinds, including upcoming European Parliament elections. He also noted that some EU member states may pose more of a problem in getting the effort off the ground. “France in particular hasn’t been super helpful linking unrelated issues into the FTA,” Willems said.
FRENCH ENVOY’S FAREWELL: U.S. AND EU ARE BETTER TOGETHER: Outgoing French Ambassador Gérard Araud urged the United States and European Union to work together to confront a number of transnational challenges, including the threat posed by China.
“It’s really my last word: Let’s invent together a new transatlantic agenda to defend our liberal democracies,” Araud said last week at a farewell party. “Internet, artificial intelligence, trade, climate change, biodiversity, tax evasion, respect for privacy should be handled by Americans and Europeans acting together because they share the same values. If we don’t do it, China will impose its authoritarian model.”
Araud, who is retiring from France’s diplomatic service, will be moving to New York, where he lived from 2009 to 2014 when he was France’s ambassador to the United Nations. “In Washington, there are too many squirrels and trees,” he said.
AUTO COMPANIES ON TARIFF PROTECTION: NO THANKS: Representatives of Ford and Fiat Chrysler provided a gentle reminder that the U.S. auto industry is not a supporter of nor do they need Trump’s threatened tariffs on cars and parts. They also expressed hope that the threat is just a negotiating strategy.
“I don’t think this administration’s end goal is tariffs. Their end goal is new trade agreements,” Shane Karr, head of external affairs for Fiat Chrysler, said at the Chamber event Monday. “The question of whether we have to suffer tariffs is a question of whether or not we can get through the negotiation process and into a free trade agreement.”
“I think the administration’s looking for leverage with an objective, I think, to reduce tariffs globally rather than to increase them,” said Michael Sheridan, vice president of international government relations at Ford.

— The Pentagon didn’t want President Donald Trump to label the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps a terrorist organization. But he did it anyway, in what has become a familiar pattern.
— Senior officers from the five military branches head to Capitol Hill to testify on the budget today.
HAPPY TUESDAY , where we're dbrown@politico.com @dave_brown24
Budget CAPS PLAN INCHES FORWARD: Democrats hoping to push forward a budget proposal that would raise defense spending caps to $733 billion in fiscal 2020 brought up two amendments Monday night meant to win over progressive lawmakers, POLITICO’s Caitlin Emma reports .
Next step: House Budget Chairman John Yarmuth (D-Ky.) said the House may vote on the legislation Wednesday morning. He has said he can afford to lose only 17 progressive votes.
Yet as of Monday night , the odds of passage weren’t great, POLITICO’s Sarah Ferris and Heather Caygle write .
“House Democratic leaders are whipping the budget caps bill, but as of Monday night the measure still didn’t have enough votes to pass. To complicate matters, progressives aren’t unified — privately some say the fight isn’t worth it while others told POLITICO they’ll oppose the bill on the floor unless their [non-defense] spending increase is included.”
IRAN IRGC’S NEW LABEL: “The Trump administration announced Monday that it is designating a key Iranian military force as a terrorist organization, an unprecedented move against a foreign government entity that met resistance from many in the Pentagon and other departments,” write POLITICO’s Nahal Toosi, Katie Galioto and Wesley Morgan.
“The designation targets Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, a group that already faces numerous U.S. sanctions. Iranian officials have blasted the latest move, warning of ‘consequences’ for U.S. troops in the Middle East.”
Risk to troops: The Pentagon had pushed back against the designation, saying it could cause harm to U.S. troops in the region. But others note that DoD has used the excuse before, including last month when Harakat al-Nujaba was labeled a terror group. Nothing happened, giving the White House ammunition against the Pentagon’s complaint.
The move marked yet another example of Trump overruling the military , Morgan and Toosi report . Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Joe Dunford, along with top Pentagon officials John Rood and Kathryn Wheelbarger, resisted the move. Pat Shanahan, however, declined to put up a fight, sources say.
Iran responded by naming U.S. Central Command a terrorist organization, per The Wall Street Journal.
HOMELAND SECURITY ANOTHER DAY, ANOTHER OUSTER: “U.S. Secret Service Director Randolph Alles is leaving the administration, the White House said Monday, amounting to President Donald Trump's second shakeup at the Department of Homeland Security in as many days,” POLITICO’s Caitlin Oprysko writes . His departure comes less than a day after Kirstjen Nielsen resigned as Homeland Security secretary.
So who’s next? At least two more people face the axe, The New York Times reports . They are L. Frances Cissna, head of Citizenship and Immigration Services, and John Mitnick, DHS general counsel.
Trump’s purge of high-level DHS officials is setting off alarm bells among GOP lawmakers, write POLITICO’s Burgess Everett, John Bresnahan and Melanie Zanona.
“The president's frantic four days of bloodletting at DHS and other agencies blindsided senior Republicans, who are already fretting about difficult confirmation battles ahead. Some are worried about the rising influence of top White House aide Stephen Miller.”
FORMER SOUTHCOM CHIEFS SPEAK OUT: Five former chiefs of U.S. Southern Command have signed a statement calling for a reversal of planned foreign aid cuts to three Central American countries. Read the statement here .

QUICK FIX Story Continued Below
— It's a jam-packed day on Capitol Hill, with EPA chief Andrew Wheeler testifying, House lawmakers marking up a bill related to the Paris climate accord and Democrats holding three hearings focused on climate change.
— David Bernhardt's nomination for Interior secretary is on track for a final vote this week after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell filed cloture Monday.
— EPA is working on policy ""expectations"" on how the agency oversees federal permitting at the state level, an agency official signaled this week, ahead of the president's expected executive order focused on the topic.
GOOD MORNING, IT'S TUESDAY! Cheniere's Khary Cauthen notched another trivia win for correctly identifying Felix Frankfurter as the most recent Supreme Court justice born abroad, in Austria. For today: Who was the only president who studied to be a doctor? THREE'S COMPANY: House lawmakers are leaving town midweek while Democrats hold their annual retreat, but not before holding three hearings today on climate change.
Former Secretary of State John Kerry and former Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel will testify to a House Oversight Committee hearing on the national security risks of climate change.
Expect Chairman Elijah Cummings to call for united action , despite the president's criticism of climate change science. ""Unfortunately, instead of mobilizing efforts to fight climate change, President Trump has attacked the science, weakened environmental protections, and undermined U.S. leadership abroad,"" he'll say, according to an excerpt from his opening statement. ""I understand that there may be differences of opinion on how we should respond, but there should be no uncertainty about whether we should respond.""
— Recall: Kerry and Hagel joined senior national security experts in a March letter to warn President Donald Trump against forming an advisory panel to challenge the scientific consensus on climate change.
Later today, Oversight’s Environment Subcommittee holds a hearing on inaction in addressing climate change. The panel will feature former Sen. Tim Wirth, Columbia University economist Jeffrey Sachs and Princeton University geoscience professor Michael Oppenheimer, a participant in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The afternoon hearing will explore ""the scientific consensus on climate change established in the 1980s, the role of the fossil fuel industry in spreading misinformation, and the consequences of policy inaction.""
At the same time this afternoon, the House Homeland Security Emergency Preparedness, Response and Recovery Subcommittee will hold its own hearing on climate change and the ""homeland security impacts."" The hearings follow a recent Pentagon report that found flooding, drought and wildfires driven by climate change pose threats to two-thirds of U.S. military installations.

ALSO ON THE HILL THAT WAS QUICK: The Colorado River drought contingency plan that would help the waterway as it faces a long-running drought cleared both chambers of Congress on Monday with bipartisan support. The bill, H.R. 2030 (116) — which was introduced last week — passed by a voice vote in the House with identical legislation, S. 1057 , clearing the Senate a few minutes later, Pro's Annie Snider reports . The bill now heads to the president's desk.
WHEELER IN THE HOUSE: Wheeler is on the Hill again today to talk about the president's requested cuts to his agency's budget for fiscal 2020. The EPA chief will testify before the House Energy and Commerce Environment and Climate Change Subcommittee, following Trump's call for a 31 percent cut to EPA's budget over current enacted funding levels. If you go: The hearing begins at 10 a.m. in 2123 Rayburn.
ALSO TODAY: The House Foreign Affairs Committee will take its turn marking up Democratic leadership's climate bill, H.R. 9 (116) , to bar the president from exiting the Paris climate agreement.
The bill is on the fast track: The House E&C Committee advanced the measure last week, amid criticism from committee Republicans that Democrats were not following regular order since they did not convene a hearing with administration witnesses for feedback nor held a subcommittee markup.
BERNHARDT VOTE COMING SOON: The Senate will vote by the end of this week to confirm David Bernhardt's nomination to lead the Interior Department permanently after Majority Leader Mitch McConnell filed for cloture on the nomination Monday, Pro's Ben Lefebvre reports .
Keep in mind: Senators are expected to head home for a two-week recess at the end of this week, and Republicans have signaled they want to move quickly on Bernhardt's nomination. Democrats may have lost a bit of the wind in their sails after Democratic Sen. Martin Heinrich 's surprise flip in support of Bernhardt in committee — but Sen. Ron Wyden is still pushing for an investigation into Bernhardt's lobbyist past.
AROUND THE AGENCIES EPA WORKING ON PERMITTING 'EXPECTATIONS' POLICY FOR STATES: EPA will write a ""national set of expectations"" policy governing how the agency oversees the ""quality and timeliness"" of federal permitting being done by the states, according to acting Deputy Administrator Henry Darwin. ""It would allow us to create a basis by which we could start having meaningful conversations about the health of individual permits and also permitting programs that can then serve as the basis for talking about differential oversight,"" he told state officials at a gathering of the Environmental Council of the States.
""We don't have any preconceived notions about what this actually will look like in detail,"" Darwin added. ""It shouldn't be viewed as us testing the states or grading the states.""
Maia Bellon, director of Washington State's Department of Ecology, warned Darwin against ""Monday morning quarterbacking."" Different states deal with different standards and many are already working hard, she added. ""If it's gap-filling or support that we need in certain areas, I'm all for that. But I would like to just recommend to you that … many of us have an incredible background and robust permitting programs so it may be an exhaustive effort for you to get into the weeds on all the permits of one state, let alone all 50 of us,"" Bellon said.
Reading between the lines: Timeliness in deciding on permits has been a major goal of the Trump EPA; Darwin earlier had noted that former Administrator Scott Pruitt had set a goal of deciding on all permits within six months. Pending applications older than six months were down 40 percent over the last 10 months, according to Darwin. Asked if EPA would develop a six-month goal for the states, a spokesman said: ""We will be working with the states to establish appropriate timeframes.""
And don't forget: The Trump administration has also been working on an executive order relating to pipelines that is expected to target, among other things, states' authority under section 401 of the Clean Water Act to certify — or decertify — projects relating to water quality implications. The use of that authority by states like Washington, and the length of time they take in reviewing those applications is expected to be a top target in the long-discussed EO.
NO, THANKS: Energy Secretary Rick Perry weighed in on rumors he's being considered to replace Kirstjen Nielsen as Homeland Security secretary, telling Bloomberg : ""I'm happy where I am and the president is happy where I am.""
MAILBAG GREENS OPPOSE OKLAHOMA JUDGE NOMINEE: The League of Conservation Voters sent a letter to senators Monday calling on them to oppose the nomination of Patrick Wyrick for U.S. district judge for the Western District of Oklahoma.
""As Solicitor General of Oklahoma, Wyrick was former Oklahoma Attorney General and EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt's 'dear friend and trusted counselor,' working together on multiple cases challenging the EPA's ability to protect public lands and clean air and address climate change,"" LCV President Gene Karpinski writes .

Tech giants on the Hill: Facebook and Google will testify today at a House hearing on hate crimes, the rise of white supremacy and how social media has a hand in both.
— Net neutrality latest: House lawmakers plan to take up their “Save the Internet Act,” an effort to restore the FCC’s repealed net neutrality rules, later today.
— Intergalactic regulation: The FCC and Commerce Department clash over a commission proposal for orbital debris.
GREETINGS AND WELCOME TO MORNING TECH. I’m your new host, Alexandra Levine, picking up the baton from Cristiano Lima, who left big shoes to fill. I’m as new to D.C. as I am to Politico — I moved from New York City three weeks ago to the day — and I’m not afraid to admit that I … already like it here better. (Scooters and cherry blossoms and a functional Metro, oh my!) . And
 us the details at ALL EYES ON HOUSE HATE CRIMES HEARING — Facebook and Google are back in the Hill hot seat to testify at a House Judiciary Committee hearing on hate crimes and the rise of white nationalism. That’s two weeks after Facebook banned white nationalist and white separatist content and just over three weeks since the Christchurch mosque attack was livestreamed on the platform, leaving Facebook, Twitter and YouTube scrambling to react and, more broadly, struggling to address the spread of violent content across social media. Couple that with criticism over censorship and demands for free speech, and no one seems to have answers. “I’m going to mention online hate but I’m not going to mention what could be done, because I don’t know,” president of the Zionist Organization of America, Mort Klein, who is testifying, told MT. “We know it’s terrible, but we don’t know how to stop it.”
— Representatives of several prominent advocacy groups , including the Anti-Defamation League and the National Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, are among the witnesses slated to testify . Officials plan to highlight how social media has fueled the spread of white supremacist hate and demand that tech platforms be held accountable for letting hate speech proliferate unchecked. “A recent ADL survey found an overwhelming and bipartisan majority of Americans (over 80 percent) want policymakers to strengthen laws and improve law enforcement training and resources for managing online hate,” the group’s senior vice president of policy, Eileen Hershenov, said in an opening statement shared with MT. “Now is the time.”
SPEAKING OF HEARINGS… — Google will send Max Pappas, manager of external outreach and public policy partnerships, to testify at Wednesday’s Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution hearing on tech “censorship,” according to a source familiar with the plans. Pappas joins Facebook public policy director Neil Potts on the witness list for the session, which is expected to focus on allegations that online platforms suppress conservative viewpoints. Twitter is reportedly also planning to send a representative.
NET NEUTRALITY HITS THE FLOOR — House lawmakers today will begin floor debate on Democrats’ Save the Internet Act, H.R. 1644 (116) , aimed at restoring the FCC’s repealed net neutrality rules, as well as 12 amendments. Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.) previewed GOP objections during a Rules Committee session Monday evening, calling the measure a “Democratic takeover of the internet.” Cole lamented Democrats’ rejection of GOP requests to negotiate compromise legislation that would avoid utility-style regulations, adding, “Common ground exists.” Rep. Mike Doyle (D-Pa.) countered that Democrats sought to address GOP concerns by adding to the bill clarifying language to codify limits to FCC authority.
— Amendments on deck: Only two Republican amendments will receive votes: one from Bob Latta (R-Ohio) to force the FCC to share which regulations the bill would permanently exempt broadband from and one from Michael Burgess (R-Texas) compelling a GAO study on “the influence of all entities” in the “internet ecosystem.”
— Doyle expressed confidence in passage. “209 co-sponsors,” he remarked to reporters Monday night. But will any Republicans join? Rep. Jeff Fortenberry (R-Neb.), who last year co-sponsored a strong net neutrality bill with former Rep. Mike Coffman (R-Colo.), said he’s not planning to revive that bill and criticized the terms of the current debate, which he said is too focused on broadband providers and not tech giants that prioritize content. “I just think the whole construct is hypocritical,” Fortenberry told reporters Monday.
COMMERCE VS. FCC ON SPACE DEBRIS — The Commerce Department in comments made public Monday warned the FCC to stand down on its review of regulations governing orbital debris — that is, decommissioned satellites and other manmade junk that presents a collision risk to anything else placed in orbit. Commerce noted that President Donald Trump has charged it and other executive branch agencies to encourage U.S. commercial space innovations through a series of Space Policy Directives.
— The department asked the FCC to defer action on its proceeding , launched in November, until the Space Policy Directives are carried out.
MUELLER REPORT BUZZ — Any day now, folks. We’ve just about hit mid-April, so Attorney General William Barr could release the redacted version of Robert Mueller’s report at any time. MT, for one, is eager to map out how technology and the internet played a role — from phishing attacks targeting Democratic operatives to fishy online personas.
— In the interim, take note of a related hearing today at 9 a.m. in federal district court: EPIC v. Department of Justice . The Electronic Privacy Information Center, a privacy watchdog, filed the lawsuit after the DOJ failed to respond to the group’s recent Freedom of Information Act request for the Mueller documents on Russian election interference.
AND FINALLY — The FTC series “ Competition and Consumer Privacy in the 21st Century ” resumes today with more than 30 policy experts convening to talk privacy and data risks at a time when the troubles facing tech giants (and the dangers posed by tech giants) are growing bigger by the day. Here’s the list of speakers for day one, including FTC Chairman Joe Simons and FTC Commissioner Noah Phillips.
— Alastair Mactaggart, who led the fight for California’s landmark consumer privacy law, will also be among the panelists. His goal today is to highlight the so-called “privacy paradox.” “The narrative that tech companies want to continue to try to push is that consumers don’t care about this because even when we give them options, they opt out,” Mactaggart told MT. “But they have some of the smartest people in the world making it as hard as possible to control your privacy. There is a tremendous consumer thirst for this, if it were easy.”
Transitions — Jared Sher, former executive vice president and deputy general counsel at 21st Century Fox, joins the Internet & Television Association as chief counsel of program network policy and deputy general counsel. … Alison Nemeth Steger , a former legal adviser to FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, moves to Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP in Washington as an associate in the communications and media group.

IN CONGRESS House Democrats launch Black Maternal Health Caucus. Reps. Alma Adams and Lauren Underwood are forming a caucus focused on African-American women’s maternal health, amid a steep rise in the maternal mortality rate for black women, POLITICO's Adam Cancryn reports.
“Black women are nearly four times more likely than white women—and more than twice as likely as women of other races—to die from preventable, pregnancy-related complications,” Adams and Underwood wrote in a dear colleague letter outlining the need for more research and policies aimed at improving black maternal health.
The lawmakers officially launch the caucus this morning with 51 members — including top Democrats Steny Hoyer, Jim Clyburn and Katherine Clark.
JIM JORDAN, MARK MEADOWS are warning pharma not to cooperate with Oversight investigation. The two senior House Republicans are telling drug companies that Democrats may leak their information in an attempt to lower their stock prices, BuzzFeed's Paul McLeod reports .
Democrats say the allegations are misleading and that warning companies not to cooperate with an investigation breaks the norms of Congress — and is possibly unprecedented.
ROSA DeLAURO threatens lawsuit after HHS bars access to facility for migrant kids. The Connecticut Democrat — who holds HHS' purse strings, as chair of the House Appropriations Labor-HHS subcommittee — warned the agency that she’s reviewing “legal remedies” after three House Democrats were barred from accessing a Florida facility where migrant children are housed.
“This will not stand,” said DeLauro, citing a 2018 law that members of Congress must be allowed to access the facilities. “[W]e will not back down from conducting the oversight the American people sent us here to do.”
— Three Florida members — Reps. Debbie Wasserman Schultz , Donna Shalala and Debbie Mucarsel-Powell — on Monday were denied entry to the HHS-funded facility in Homestead, Florida. The members were told that they needed to schedule visits two weeks in advance, DeLauro’s office told POLITICO, which Democrats maintain would defeat the purpose of conducting oversight.
— HHS says two-weeks notice is necessary for scheduling a visit. ""This has been HHS policy since 2015,"" said Evelyn Stauffer, an HHS senior adviser, who added that the policy is necessary to protect the privacy and well-being of the kids. ""It meets our current statutory obligation to provide members of Congress with facility access.""

Mnuchin to face a brutal grilling,www.politico.com,politico.com,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-money/2019/04/09/mnuchin-to-face-a-brutal-grilling-422758," Mnuchin preview — Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is in for a brutal grilling this afternoon before the House Financial Services Committee. MM spoke to Cap Alpha’s Ian Katz about what to expect: “[Dems] are going to be very aggressive. They haven’t really had a shot at him like this. And we’ve got the tax return issues and sanctions on Russia and the Fed nominees.
“I do think the GSEs will come up and how hard they are going to push on that. These hearings are rarely about international issues [as they are billed to be]. To be a success, Mnuchin will just have to not say anything that angers President Trump, which means he is certainly going to anger committee Democrats.” (Mnuchin testifies early in the day before House Appropriations subcommittee)
Could the GOP stand up to Trump on the Fed? — Our Victoria Guida writes here about the possibility that Senate Republicans, who generally give President Trump what he wants, could draw the line at his efforts to influence Federal Reserve policy:
“[I]nterviews with numerous influential Republicans in the Senate and House show an overwhelming faith in the Fed under Powell.”
Is the Fed in full retreat? — Tim Clark, who started the stress tests for Too Big to Fail banks at the Fed writes in a new POLITICO op-ed that the central bank is unilaterally disarming: “After nine years of pitched battle with the banks over stress tests, the Fed has decided to retreat and, in the process, weakened its capacity to hold them accountable for dangerously bad practices.” Read more .

EARLY BANK HEARING PREP — Tons of chatter already about Wednesday’s big bank CEO hearing. Via Compass Point’s Isaac Boltansky: “If you are looking for a nuanced consideration of the regulatory regime for the nation’s largest banks, we recommend looking elsewhere. This hearing is likely to be more politics than policy given the combination of bright lights and populist undercurrents.”
MM EXCLUSIVE FIRST LOOK — Better Markets will be out today with a report ahead of the hearing entitled: “The RAP Sheet for Wall Street’s biggest banks’ crime spree.” Per release: “The Report released today details, for the first time, that, of the more than $29 trillion in total bailouts, the six biggest banks in the country (Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, and Wells Fargo) received more than $8.2 trillion, or nearly one-third of the total bailouts provided to the entire financial system” Full report .
The bankers will argue by contrast that they are much better capitalized and that post-crisis regulatory reforms have done nothing to make the system less safe. They will also argue that record profits does not mean more risk.

More on Mnuchin — Larry Summers in WaPo argues that the IRS chief has to release Trump’s tax returns and Mnuchin must not stop him.
Via CAP’s Gregg Gelzinis: “Secretary Mnuchin should be held accountable for casting aside the FSOC’s mission by deregulating the remaining nonbank SIFIs, making it more difficult to use the Council’s tools, and dismantling its institutional capabilities from within. The financial system is less resilient today as a direct result of his actions.”

Not only are they concerned that the leadership void will make it more difficult to tackle the crisis at the southern border, but they also are worried that hard-liners like White House aide Stephen Miller will have more influence over Trump’s immigration agenda — which could be disastrous for some Republicans in 2020. Just look at these alarmed responses: Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) called the ouster of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen “classless”; Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) warned that immigration might be a winning issue for Trump, but “it may not work for everybody else”; and Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) called the whole situation a “mess.”
Now, Republicans are in damage control mode, with Sen. Chuck Grassley scrambling to prevent Trump from canning any more top officials. According to the Washington Post, the Iowa Republican was even planning to go on Fox News to help plead his case to the president. But while the GOP has been more comfortable speaking out against Trump, it’s unclear just how far they are willing to go to stop him. The dispatch from Burgess, Bres and your Huddle host: https://politi.co/2D66KXx .
CREATING EVEN MORE HEADACHES … multiple news outlets reported that the Trump administration is considering reviving a version of its controversial family separation policy, which was deeply unpopular among suburban and women voters in the last election. Republicans swiftly pushed back on the idea, reports The Hill, warning that it could lead to a brutal confirmation hearing to replace Nielsen. More from Alexander Bolton: http://bit.ly/2UAwRQv .

While the hearing is not focused on special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia report, Democrats plan to press him for information about when the final report will land on Capitol Hill, how heavily it will be redacted and why Barr made certain decisions when crafting an initial summary of the report. Tuesday’s hearing will likely serve as a preview of the big show on May 2, when the House Judiciary Committee plans to haul Barr in to testify.

STILL SHORT -- House Democrats are slated to vote Wednesday on a budget bill that will serve as the party’s opening bid to Republicans on a looming spending caps battle. But for now, they’re still short the votes, Sarah and Heather report. The big question is whether progressives will get on board after complaining for weeks that they want even more cash for domestic programs.
House Budget chief John Yarmuth will make his case to the caucus Tuesday morning, where he’ll need to win over dozens of fellow Congressional Progressive Caucus members without losing moderates. With their first year of House control, progressive leaders want to shake up budget negotiations by demanding a near-equal split between defense and domestic programs, after years of seeing the Pentagon receive the lion’s share of discretionary dollars.

WHAT PURITY PLEDGE? -- Scores of freshman Democrats vowed to not take any money from corporate PACs on the campaign trail. But some of them are still taking personal checks or attending fundraisers hosted by corporations’ lobbyists, reports Theodoric Meyer. Examples: Rep. Gil Cisneros (D-Calif.) went to a fundraiser hosted by four lobbyists who represent major corporate clients, while Rep. Cindy Axne (D-Iowa) held a fundraiser late last month at the offices of the Washington lobbying firm Cornerstone Government Affairs.
Technically, these lawmakers aren’t violating their purity pledges.

QUICK FIX Story Continued Below
— IRS Commissioner Chuck Rettig today makes his first appearance before Congress since his confirmation, where he’ll likely have to break his silence on House Democrats’ efforts to get President Donald Trump’s tax returns.
— Another potential issue for Rettig this week: New statistics showing high audit rates in areas with comparatively high numbers of Earned Income Tax Credit recipients.
— Some new Tax Day polling: A new survey found that just one in six believe that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, H.R. 1 (115) , actually cut their taxes.
WELCOME TO TUESDAY, where that is quite the battle going on over go-go music in D.C.’s Shaw neighborhood.
And our last NCAA Tournament thought of the year: Has a team ever won their final three games after being down in the last 15 seconds? Would seem unlikely!
Today also marks 159 years since the creation of the oldest known recording of the human voice, made by Edouard-Leon Scott de Martinville on his invention, the phonautograph. (Not to be confused with Thomas Edison’s phonograph, which de Martinville’s creation predated by two decades.)

Driving the Day WELCOME BACK, MR. RETTIG: Interesting timing here for the commissioner, who returns to the Hill less than a week after House Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal (D-Mass.) put in for Trump’s returns (and as the president’s allies are digging in their heels against that request).
Rettig himself has yet to publicly comment on Neal’s official demand for the returns, which the commissioner received by hand during a separate meeting on the Hill last week. But one way or another, that silence is almost certain to end this afternoon, when Rettig appears before a House Appropriations subcommittee about the IRS budget.
Lay of the land: Trump himself escalated the returns issue on Monday, via a retweet of Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), as our Caitlin Oprysko reports. (Jordan, you might recall, was one of the more strident critics of the IRS over its treatment of tea party groups seeking tax-exempt status.)
And up in the president’s home base of New York, Democratic lawmakers have introduced legislation that would allow Albany to share state tax returns with congressional committees, as our Bill Mahoney reported. There’s been no sign yet that legislative leaders will take up those proposals, after essentially ignoring other bills the past couple of years dealing with Trump’s returns. (Interesting side note: The proposal was sharply criticized by Ed Cox, the state GOP chairman — who was Richard Nixon’s son-in-law.)
HOW ABOUT THE EITC? Rettig also testifies before the Senate Finance Committee on Wednesday, and here’s another issue he could hear about this week — new findings that some of the areas in the U.S. where taxpayers are most likely to get audited have high poverty rates and lots of Earned Income Tax Credit recipients.
Those statistics also got some attention on Monday, even before Rettig’s appearances. Sen. Angus King (I-Maine) wrote in a letter to Rettig and Kirsten Wielobob, the IRS’s deputy commissioner for services and enforcement, that there were a “disproportionate” number of audits in two of his state’s poorest counties — both with average median annual incomes of around $40,000. Among the questions King asks of the agency in his letter — what the IRS will do to make sure that it “audits taxpayers most responsible for the federal tax gap?”
“This does not seem to be a place for the IRS to be using its resources,” King told Morning Tax on Monday. “There are more lucrative places to be looking.” The IRS has said that its audit process “is designed to select returns with the highest likelihood of noncompliance,” and that “the selection criteria does not include any components or factors related to the geographic location or ethnicity of the taxpayers.”
Related note: A new report from the Bipartisan Policy Center lays out how the EITC and the Child Tax Credit can be effective anti-poverty programs, but also difficult to administer — with high (if potentially overstated) improper payment rates.
Also on the schedule today: The working group on the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act’s $10,000 cap on state and local deductions, formed by Democrats on House Ways and Means, is scheduled to hold its second meeting today at 4 p.m.
A related note to the SALT cap, via the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center: “Around 4 million taxpayers per year have paid the individual Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) since 2005. Due to 2017's tax law changes, the AMT will be paid by only about 200,000 taxpayers , and will impose tax of around $5 billion in 2018, down from $31 billion in 2016.” (In previous years, most people who topped five figures in SALT charges also paid the AMT.)
FEELING THE TAX CUT? The truth is that a healthy majority of taxpayers will see their tax burden go down because of the TCJA. But a new NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll found that the people themselves aren’t so sure that’s happening.
Beyond the 17 percent who believe the tax law will cut their taxes, respondents basically split evenly on three other answers — 28 percent believed they’ll pay more, 28 percent didn’t know and 27 percent think their tax burden didn’t change.
And yet keep in mind: The overall polling on TCJA has seen its share of fluctuations and has averaged out to be a net positive at times this year, though the law’s popularity has taken a dip in a couple recent polls.

Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said there was an “exasperation” about taxes after the government held two months’ worth of town halls to get a sense of the country’s preferences, in the wake of the Yellow Vest protests started by gas tax increases. “Among the findings, valued added tax and income tax were the levies that most people listed as needing reduction. Only about 10 percent of people cited bringing back the wealth tax, though about 28 percent want higher income taxes for wealthy earners.”
STATE NEWS GONNA BE A NICE SHOWDOWN? Minnesota’s Democrat-led House rolled out a tax plan that would raise $1.2 billion in new revenues, largely from corporations, as The Minneapolis Star Tribune reported. And just like with the Democrats’ efforts to hike the gas tax, this plan faces steep opposition in the GOP-controlled state Senate. The Democrats would use the influx in revenue for new school funding, through a plan that they say would also give a tax cut to two-thirds of state tax filers. One way it does that is by expanding the standard deduction to the point that it would be used by a projected 93 percent of families. The losers under the plan would be corporations with foreign income, while the proposal would also place a 3 percent tax on capital gains above $500,000.

I am honored to appear before you today to present the President’s fiscal year (FY) 2020 budget for the Department of Justice. I am joined here by the Department’s Chief Financial Officer: Assistant Attorney General for Administration Lee Lofthus. Let me start by thanking you for your strong support of the Department in the recently enacted FY 2019 Omnibus Appropriations Act. President Trump’s FY 2020 Budget proposal totals $29.2 billion for the Department of Justice to support federal law enforcement and the public safety priorities of our state, local, and tribal law enforcement partners. The request reflects a commitment to the Department’s priorities of reducing violent crime, enforcing the nation’s immigration laws, combating the opioid epidemic, and addressing national security threats to this great nation.
Story Continued Below
First, the Department of Justice is working hard every day to combat violent crime.
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) statistics show that, in 2015 and 2016, the United States experienced the largest increases in violent crime in a quarter-century.
The Administration has prioritized reversing that trend. In 2017 and 2018, the Department revitalized federal efforts to fight violent crime, including the launch of the enhanced Project Safe Neighborhoods (PSN) initiative, which brings together all levels of law enforcement and the communities they serve to develop effective, locally based strategies to reduce violent crime. In FY 2018, the Department prosecuted the greatest number of violent criminals in at least 25 years, thanks to the necessary resources provided by this Committee and Congress. Since 2016, violent crime has decreased.

Of course, the Department’s work is not done—crime is still far too high, especially in the most vulnerable neighborhoods. We need to build on our efforts in 2019 and beyond. To that end, the FY 2020 budget allocates an additional $137.9 million to reduce violent crime and combat transnational criminal organizations (TCOs). These resources will enable the Department to dismantle the worst criminal organizations and target the most violent offenders.
Second, the Department remains committed to enforcing and improving our immigration laws. As I’ve stated before, in order to ensure that our immigration system works properly, we must secure our Nation’s borders, and we must ensure that our laws allow us to process, hold, and remove those who violate our immigration laws. Through the FY 2020 President’s budget, the Department will continue improving its ability to enforce our immigration laws and combat illegal immigration by expanding court capacity for immigration hearings, improving efficiency in the immigration process, and removing impediments to the timely administration of justice.
Specifically, the budget requests an additional $72.1 million to enhance border security and immigration enforcement. To maintain the efficacy and efficiency of immigration enforcement and adjudication programs, the Department requests $71.1 million for 100 new immigration judges and support staff for the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR). This budget request supports the Department, along with our partners at the Department of Homeland Security, in our efforts to fix our immigration system.
Third, the Department is fighting hard against the scourge of illegal drugs, and in particular the opioid crisis. The United States is in the midst of the deadliest drug epidemic in American history. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), more than 70,200 Americans died from drug overdoses in 2017, a 10 percent increase from the previous year. The President declared a National Public Health Emergency in October 2017, and the Department remains committed to doing its part to protect the American people from the impact of drugs and drug-related crimes nationwide. In 2018, the Department charged 7,000 defendants with offenses involving fentanyl, heroin, or opioids; that is a Department record, and we are on track to break it this year. But despite these record efforts, overdose deaths remain far too high.
The Department must redouble its efforts to combat this crisis. The budget includes $295 million to enable the Department to target the organizations responsible for the opioid epidemic and drug-related violence in our communities. It also bolsters the capacity of Department agents to deny revenues to drug traffickers using the best cyber capabilities and technologies, enabling the Department to keep pace with these nefarious actors.
Fourth, the Department is pursuing several programs—both old and new—to protect national security. These include protecting American elections from foreign interference, combating and preventing cyber attacks, and fighting terrorism both at home and abroad. The budget dedicates $132 million in program enhancements to address constantly evolving national security threats, including the areas of cyber, counterterrorism, and counterintelligence.
Our DOJ team, along with our federal, state, local, and tribal partners, has been working diligently to address these issues each and every day. The budget request supports many other key programs, for example, by prioritizing public safety at the state, local, and tribal levels through approximately $4.3 billion in discretionary and mandatory funding and by securing funds to help the victims of crime. In line with the President’s priorities and Congress’s shared commitment to protecting the public fisc, our proposal also includes restructuring initiatives that are designed to reduce both bureaucracy and costs to the American taxpayer.
Congress
Barr: Mueller turned down offer to review Russia probe findings By KYLE CHENEY and ANDREW DESIDERIO
Let me say clearly, Mr. Chairman, you and this Committee have been strongly supportive. We are determined to use every dollar you have provided to us to achieve the maximum benefit in our efforts to fight crime and protect the American people. I would now to like to tell you more about how our budget proposal furthers the priorities that I have just outlined.
Combating Violent Crime Protecting the American people from violent crime is a top priority for the Department of Justice. In 2015 and 2016, violent crime increased by nearly 7 percent. Robberies, assaults, and rapes all increased, and murder increased by a shocking 20 percent.
As a result of the Department’s efforts, violent crime has decreased nationwide since 2016. 3 A key part of this success has been the revitalization of Project Safe Neighborhoods that I mentioned above. We are requesting a total of $100 million for this important program. Under this program, grants are awarded to local law enforcement agencies, outreach and prevention service providers, and researchers to support activities implementing local PSN anti-violence strategies across the country.
The FY 2020 budget requests a total of $137.9 million in program enhancements to reduce violent crime and combat TCOs. This includes funding for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) National Integrated Ballistic Information Network (NIBIN). The funds will allow ATF to expand the National Correlation and Tracing Center (NNCTC) services to an additional five sites in FY 2020, support additional training, increase the capacity of ballistic imaging and correlation hardware and software, and provide necessary infrastructure for further expansion of services to NIBIN sites. This will bring NIBIN to approximately 200 sites by the end of FY 2020. The Department is also requesting $4.2 million to enable the FBI to increase their capacity to perform Criminal Background Check System (NICS) background checks for firearms purchases.
To ensure this continued decrease in crime, the Department is requesting $5.8 million to enhance violent crime and firearms prosecutions by United States Attorneys’ Offices. This request will give our United States Attorneys the support they need to prosecute complex criminal cases.
The request also provides $18.2 million for the FBI to counter the ever-evolving threat posed by TCOs. This enhancement will support the FBI’s Joint Criminal Opioid Darknet Enforcement (J-CODE) initiative to disrupt and dismantle the Darknet illicit marketplaces facilitating the distribution of fentanyl and other opioids. This critical initiative brings together agents, analysts, federal, state, local, and tribal law enforcement with expertise in drugs, gangs, and health care fraud from across the U.S. Government to target the trafficking of fentanyl and other opioids on the Darknet.
Understanding the need to address violent crime at our borders with our state and local partners, the Department is requesting $6 million for a new grant program in the Office of Justice Programs (OJP): the Southwest Border Rural Law Enforcement Violent Crime Reduction Initiative. This program will empower rural law enforcement agencies by providing training, technical assistance, and resources to interdict drug and human traffickers who are exploiting the corridors into our country.
Enforcing Immigration Laws Enforcement of the Nation’s immigration laws also remains a vital mission of the Department. As I have said many times, the United States has some of the world’s most liberal and expansive immigration laws, and we aim to admit visitors and immigrants equitably from all around the globe. But the integrity and fairness of our immigration system depends on robust enforcement against those who flout or circumvent our laws. To safeguard our borders and ensure due process, the Department is requesting an additional $72.1 million for immigration enforcement.
This request includes funding for 100 new immigration judges, which will bring EOIR’s authorized immigration judge level to 634 by the end of FY 2020 – a 31 percent increase since FY 2018. The Department believes that these new immigration judges are necessary to provide some relief from a critical backlog in the immigration courts. At the end of the first quarter of FY 2019, there were over 820,000 cases pending in immigration courts nationwide. That caseload is by far the largest-ever pending caseload before the Department, marking the 12th consecutive year of increased backlogs. The 100 new immigration judges will help us to reverse that trend—but it is important to note that the continued influx of cases originating from the border constrains our ability to manage the backlog of cases, and other reforms are necessary.
The request also includes an increase of roughly $1 million for the Department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division (ENRD) to support their Land Acquisition Section. The President has prioritized efforts to build and maintain physical barriers at the Southern Border. The Land Acquisition Section is responsible for assisting DHS and other federal partners in acquiring real property for border security projects. These funds will allow ENRD to commit 6 more attorneys to these efforts.
Combating the Opioid Epidemic Overdose deaths—and in particular, deaths from opioid overdoses—remain a public health crisis, and trafficking of illegal drugs is closely tied to the ongoing problems of violent crime and border security. The Department of Justice has been working hard to fight drug trafficking and diversion, but much, much more remains to be done. That is why the Department is requesting an additional $295 million to combat the opioid crisis and bolster drug enforcement efforts.
The Department’s approach to combating the opioid epidemic includes a request for $11.1 million to fund five new heroin enforcement groups that will be deployed to Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) Field Divisions that have identified heroin as the first- or second-greatest threat to their area. These resources will also allow for more agents at DEA Field Divisions to target the Mexican TCOs that pose the greatest drug threat to the United States. An additional $1.65 million will go to support DEA’s flagship Sensitive Investigative Unit (SIU) Program to combat highly sophisticated TCOs known for supplying illicit substances to distributors and users in the United States. The Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces (OCDETF) Program has requested $2 million in operational funds to support the ongoing and rapidly expanding National Opioid Initiative. This will support the hundreds of federal agents and prosecutors who are handling the expansion of opioid investigations.
Further, DEA manages or participates in Translation and Transcription Support Services, known as Judicial Wire Intercept Programs (JWIP), in approximately 20 countries. An additional $10 million in funding will go to support the consolidation of nine core legacy judicial wire intercept systems into one new judicial wire intercept platform in Colombia. In addition, DEA requests $11.7 million to invest in its cyber investigation capabilities. With these funds, DEA intends to place technical specialists in each of DEA’s 23 field offices to assist agents in cyber-specific cases.
Finally, the President’s Budget proposes to permanently transfer management of the $254 million High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas (HIDTA) Program from the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) to DEA to facilitate stronger coordination with other drug enforcement assets. Transferring the HIDTA grants to DEA will enable the agency to focus on combating drug trafficking in areas where the threat is the greatest and where there is a coordinated law enforcement presence.
National Security National Security remains among the Department’s top priorities. Threats are constantly evolving, requiring additional investments to mitigate these threats. Therefore, the Department’s FY 2020 budget includes a request of $132 million in program enhancements focused on cyber, counterterrorism, and counterintelligence. It also reflects an increased role for the U.S. Marshals Service (USMS) in dignitary protection to promote government-wide efficiency.
Election security is a key issue for the Department. Working together with our partners in the federal government, I will build on the work already done by the Department in this area and ensure that the full might of our resources are brought to bear against foreign persons who unlawfully interfere in our elections. I believe that our country must respond to any foreign interference with the strongest measures, and we must work with partners at the state level to ensure that our election infrastructure is completely protected.
Similarly, we must protect Americans against cyber attacks, whether foreign or domestic. The Department requests an additional $70.5 million to enhance the FBI’s cyber information- sharing abilities and cyber tools and capabilities. The FBI’s multi-pronged cyber enterprise strategy uses predictive means and investigative partnerships to impose consequences against cyber adversaries who target U.S. interests. Additionally, to protect high-value assets and information in the Department’s data centers, DOJ must improve security monitoring at all levels. As such, the Department requests $2 million to extend its detection and response capabilities beyond the on-premises network to the places where our data resides.
In our efforts to combat terrorism, the Department is requesting $16.6 million for the National Vetting Center (NVC). This request will provide for the vetting of people seeking to enter or remain within the United States. The NVC will increase the government’s ability to identify terrorists, criminals, and other nefarious actors. These resources will help enable the NVC to provide timely information regarding the risk an individual poses. Furthermore, the Department requests $17.1 million to enhance the FBI's capability to respond to threats posed by chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear devices found within the United States and its territories.
In addition, the Department is requesting $18.3 million for the FBI to address counterintelligence threats, particularly those from hostile foreign intelligence agencies and other non-state and criminal adversaries employing advanced cyber-based attacks. These resources will allow the Department to combat these growing and serious threats by bolstering cyber investigative and collaborative capabilities and capacities. The request will also assist the FBI in providing support to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which reviews foreign acquisitions of domestic entities that might affect national security.
Additionally, the Department is requesting $5 million to support efforts of the National Security Division (NSD) to prevent foreign intelligence services from accessing sensitive information and technology. The request will support NSD’s review, mitigation, and monitoring of foreign investments in the United States for national security risks including filings on behalf of CFIUS. The Department also requests $1.4 million to support NSD’s growing mission of protecting national assets against cyber threats, including thwarting efforts by terrorists and nation states to infiltrate our critical infrastructure and combating economic espionage.
In an effort to improve services and to save taxpayer money in the long run, the Department is requesting $1 million for the Protective Detail Consolidation evaluation. The USMS will evaluate protection requirements for civilian Cabinet and sub-Cabinet level officials in support of the President’s 2018 Government Reform and Reorganization Plan. The USMS will coordinate with Executive Branch agencies to assess existing agency protective plans, develop standards and best practices for protective detail staffing and evaluation, and prepare a range of policy options to promote standardization and effective monitoring, assessment, and response to potential threats.
State, Local, and Tribal Assistance The Department supports its partners in state, local, and tribal law enforcement, whose actions are crucial in the fight against violent crime and the opioid epidemic. The FY 2020 budget continues that commitment to state, local, and tribal public safety officials by investing approximately $4.3 billion in discretionary and mandatory funding in programs to assist them. This includes $405.2 million in total funding for the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program (Byrne JAG). This funding is the primary source of flexible funding for state, local, and tribal jurisdictions across all components of the criminal justice system. Byrne JAG funding is used to address critical gaps in their criminal justice systems in order to increase public safety and prevent crime. In 2020, Byrne JAG will also fund other important officer safety programs serving state, local, and tribal law enforcement, including $22.5 million for the Bulletproof Vest Program, $22.5 million for the Body Worn Cameras Program, $3.6 million for the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System (NamUs), and $15 million for the Valor Initiative. Two additional set-asides include $5 million for the Public Safety Partnership (PSP) Program, which leverages DOJ resources to reduce violence in cities with the highest violent crime rates, and $6 million for the Southwest Border Law Enforcement Violent Crime Initiative, which I discussed previously. Finally, our budget request includes $330 million for programs authorized by the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act of 2016.
In December, Congress passed and the President signed the First Step Act of 2018, which seeks to reduce recidivism, refine sentencing laws, and eliminate disproportionate penalties for certain crimes. I intend to robustly fund and diligently implement this bill at the Department.
The Act directs the National Institute of Justice (NIJ) to evaluate Second Chance Act programs no later than five years after its enactment. Therefore, the FY 2020 Budget requests $1.5 million for NIJ to support the first phase of this evaluation, which will focus on identifying appropriate outcome measures for Second Chance Act programs. In addition, related to the First Step Act, the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) is requesting $14 million to incentivize the development of innovative pilot projects in reentry and recidivism-reduction approaches. BOP is also requesting $1 million to expand the availability of medication-assisted treatment for inmates with opioid abuse disorders and to enable more inmates to get treatment.
We can never forget that crime statistics represent crime victims whose lives have been changed by criminal acts. In recognition of National Crime Victims’ Rights Week, the Department renews its commitment to strive for justice and to connect these survivors with vital services as they heal. The President’s budget includes $2.3 billion from the Crime Victims Fund to assist victims and survivors of crime, to build capacity to enhance response to crime victims’ needs, and to increase offender accountability. Of this total, $115 million will be devoted to improving services and justice for tribal victims of crime, as the violent crime rate in Indian Country remains extraordinarily high.
In addition, the budget includes $77 million in discretionary funding for grants to support human trafficking victims and those providing direct services for survivors and improving the community response to victims through outreach, training, and technical assistance.
Restructuring Initiatives The Administration is committed to establishing a leaner, more productive federal government that reduces both bureaucracy and costs to the American taxpayer. Since 2017, the Department of Justice has undertaken efforts to refocus resources and return our efforts to our core mission. To support the President’s Executive Order on Reorganizing the Executive Branch, the Department of Justice has begun taking steps to streamline and improve its good stewardship of taxpayers’ dollars. As part of the FY 2020 President’s Budget, the Department is proposing a number of initiatives to achieve savings, reduce the size of government, and maximize agency performance. Highlights of the restructuring initiatives include:
• The FY 2020 budget proposes legislation that will move the responsibilities related to alcohol and tobacco enforcement from ATF to the Department of Treasury’s Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau. ATF will retain its current enforcement responsibilities for firearms and explosives. The transfer of the alcohol and tobacco authorities will allow ATF to devote additional resources to its primary mission of combating violent crime through initiatives such as its highly effective NIBIN and Crime Gun Intelligence Centers.
• The Department proposes to improve our service to our state, local, and tribal partners and our grant programs in a variety of ways. The Department is developing one grants- management system to streamline and improve the grants process. The request also consolidates the Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) within OJP. The budget also proposes to transfer activities of the National Institute of Corrections from the BOP to OJP. This will help to consolidate the Department’s state and local corrections research and evaluation programs and better align efforts to assist state, local, and tribal corrections professionals with OJP grant programs.
• The budget also proposes to transfer the functions of the Community Relations Service to the Civil Rights Division, allowing to the Department to perform its community mediation work in a more centralized manner and at a greater savings to the taxpayer.
• As previously noted, the budget proposes to transfer the HIDTA grant program from ONDCP to DEA. This change will eliminate redundancies within federal organizations by moving this program, which supports states and communities fighting the scourge of illegal drugs, into the same agency leading the enforcement efforts in those communities.
Chairman Serrano and Ranking Member Aderholt, it is my pleasure to highlight our efforts to be good stewards of the resources and authorities bestowed on us as we strengthen the Department’s ability to ensure safety, equality, and justice for all Americans. As Attorney General, I am committed to making the Department of Justice run as efficiently and effectively as possible, without adding to the burden on the American taxpayer. I thank you for your past support of the Department’s financial needs, and for the opportunity to present our FY 2020 budget request. I look forward to working with you through the upcoming fiscal year to ensure that the Department of Justice remains on solid financial footing and can accomplish its multiple and varied missions effectively. I look forward to your questions. Thank you."

Another high-profile sporting event fiasco for NJ Transit - POLITICO,www.politico.com,,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/newsletters/new-jersey-playbook/2019/04/09/another-high-profile-sporting-event-fiasco-for-nj-transit-422453,"Presented by Pre-K Our Way
Another high-profile sporting event in the Meadowlands, another embarrassment for NJ Transit.
Wrestling fans who showed up for Wrestlemania may not mind that the matches they’re watching are staged. But they did mind when they have to wait in long lines — in the rain — for infrequent trains to take them home from MetLIfe Stadium in the wee hours. Read more about that here .
NJ Transit blames the flap on the WWE giving them an incorrect ending time for the event’s end. The agency says federal overtime rules barred it from having more employees work overtime. WWE says it doesn’t advertise end times, which doesn’t directly refute NJ Transit but apparently a lot of wrestling fans expected this to last into the wee hours. Gov. Murphy says the agency failed to communicate.
This harks back to the 2014 Super Bowl, for which attendees were encouraged to take what turned out to be trains run by a woefully under-equipped agency.
Whatever the case, this was a stone cold disaster. The ultimate failure. A hulking mess. The big sh!tshow. A typhoon of crap. One might argue this agency is due for the undertaker. Read more about it here .

WALKING THE POLANCO — “NJ schools authority faces investigation from attorney general, sources say,” by The Record’s Dustin Racioppi: “The New Jersey Attorney General's Office is investigating hiring practices and recent allegations of employee file tampering at the state's Schools Development Authority, according to three sources familiar with the matter. Separately, the State Commission of Investigation, a legislative agency focused on taxpayer waste, public corruption and organized crime, has interviewed at least two people about their dealings with the authority, according to two other sources involved in that inquiry. The dual inquiries add outside scrutiny on the schools authority, an agency that has already drawn negative attention for months — first for its mysterious hiring of a former Murphy campaign aide accused of sexual assault and, more recently, for a controversial restructuring under Chief Executive Officer Lizette Delgado-Polanco … The attorney general's investigation began before details of that restructuring became public, according to the people involved, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to talk about the inquiry. The governor's office had incorrectly received a personnel complaint, so it passed the complaint on to the Attorney General's Office as it would for any such personnel matter, a senior administration official said Monday morning.” Read more here
NO EXIT — Exit exam requirements for freshmen, sophomores unclear as spring testing begins, by POLITICO’s Linh Tat: As high school students throughout New Jersey begin the spring testing period for state assessments, it remains unclear whether the scores for current 9th and 10th graders can be used to satisfy their graduation requirements. If not, hundreds of thousands of students from the classes of 2021 and 2022 — current freshmen and sophomores — could be forced to sit for yet another test their junior year. That scenario is sure to cause an uproar among education advocates who believe students are overtested as is, not to mention a concern by some that a current law is forcing the state to rush to implement a new assessment by next school year. “I think parents are going to be pissed. I think students are going to be pissed,” said Julie Borst of Save Our Schools NJ. “If they were to come out and say ‘we’re going to test you [again],’ … I think that stinks.” Read more here
CRAZY IDEA: INSTEAD OF REBATES, TRY POLICIES TO ACTUALLY LOWER PROPERTY TAXES — “New scrutiny of longtime income cap on NJ seniors’ property-tax relief,” by NJ Spotlight’s John Reitmeyer: “It’s not easy to find, but among the details of the state budget for fiscal year 2020 that Gov. Phil Murphy released a few weeks ago is language that would deny some New Jersey senior citizens property-tax relief checks even though state law says they deserve them. If lawmakers allow the fine print to remain in the state budget, that will once again keep a lid on cost-of-living increases that by law are supposed to go to seniors who meet all other qualifications for the state’s popular ‘senior freeze’ property-tax relief program. Murphy, a first-term Democrat, is just the latest governor to carry on the largely overlooked budgeting policy, which began when New Jersey was hemorrhaging revenue and struggling to get by during the Great Recession.” Read more here
1 MASTRO — ELEC: Public contractors made $9M in political donations in 2018, by POLITICO’s Matt Friedman: New Jersey public contractors made about $9 million in political donations in 2018, and the biggest donation went to an organization that doesn’t publicly disclose its donors, according to an analysis by the New Jersey State Election Law Enforcement Commission. The biggest single contractor donation, according to ELEC, came from the real estate holdings company Hartz Mountain Industries.

POLL POSITION — Poll: New Jersey politicians not winning any popularity contests, by POLITICO’s Matt Friedman: U.S. Senator and presidential candidate Cory Booker is the most popular statewide elected official in New Jersey, but the Democrat’s numbers are less than stellar, according to a new poll released Tuesday. According to the joint Rutgers-Eagleton/FDU poll, Booker, New Jersey’s junior senator, is viewed favorably by 46 percent of New Jersey residents, while 32 percent have an unfavorable opinion of him. Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy, meanwhile, is viewed favorably by 43 percent of those questioned and unfavorably by 37 percent, the poll found. It’s all downhill from there for the state’s politicians.

CANDIDATE IS SO AGAINST ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION HE WON’T MIGRATE TO NJ UNTIL HE IS LEGALLY REQUIRED TO — “Sherrill challenger has never lived in New Jersey,” by New Jersey Globe’s David Wildstein: “If you want to be Stephen Colbert’s congressman, you’d better know your district. That might be a problem for Reinier Prijten, who announced last week that he would challenge freshman Rep. Mikie Sherrill (D-Montclair) in New Jersey’s 11th district, where famous residents include Colbert and self-proclaimed `Jersey Guy‘ Chris Christie. `Reinier Prijten will become a full-time resident of Morristown, New Jersey in May, after finishing a temporary business endeavor in California. He had lived in the New York region most of the last 30 years,‘ said his spokesman, Jay Townsend. Records show that Prijten has never lived in New Jersey and has voted out of an address in New Rochelle, New York. His website says that he ‘resides with his son in Morristown.’ He uses a Morristown address that matches up to the UPS store and his campaign account was opened with a Tampa, Florida bank, according to Prijten’s filing with the Federal Election Commission.” Read more here

ELIZABOOKOURKE — “Cory Booker's 2020 Frustration,” by U.S. News’ David Catanese: “Booker's campaign is just 67 days old and he has yet to have a breakout moment, like Kamala Harris or Buttigieg. He raised just $5 million during the first two months. But his NAN speech was instructive for how he's going to attempt to crawl out of single digits and into the top tier: Win the room with sky-high rhetoric that is underpinned by substantive solutions. If O'Rourke is the candidate of feel-good flowery oratory and Elizabeth Warren is the queen of substance, Booker might represent the marriage of the two.” Read more here

Cory Booker is introducing a Senate bill to study reparations for African Americans — a companion bill to Rep.

Salant: “U.S. Rep. Bill Pascrell, who has been fighting for two years to get Trump’s tax returns released, said the president eventually will have to surrender them under federal law. ‘The point of the matter is we are working within the law as it exists,’ said Pascrell, D-9th Dist., a member of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee. ‘We’re living up to our responsibilities. We’re not going to stop until we’re successful.’ The chairman of the committee, Rep. Richard Neal, D-Mass., asked the Internal Revenue Service last week for six years of Trump’s personal and business tax returns, which he is entitled to under a 1924 federal law enacted in response to the Teapot Dome scandal.” Read more here

Tom Malinowski (D-Rocky Hill) in New Jersey’s 7th district, the New Jersey Globe has learned.

MIDDLESEX TO CHANGE COUNTY NAME TO ‘MIDDLE’ — “Middlesex county Democrats try to overturn ‘outdated’ gender rule,” by NJ Spotlight’s Colleen O’Dea: “Some Democrats in Middlesex County are trying to upend a decades-old law that requires a strict division between the sexes in certain elections. Voters there must choose one male and one female to represent them on county party committees, a rule that only some counties still follow. But the Central Jersey Progressive Democrats group, which formed in the wake of the 2016 election, considers the one-male-and-one-female committee member rule to be outdated and notes that several counties have abandoned it. The organization is seeking to run four committee slates of two women each. Another candidate identifies as non-binary, or neither male nor female, and is looking to run without any gender label. ‘It is unfortunate that there are outdated laws that prevent two women from representing one district together,’ said Quiyana Butler, who has filed to run for a committee seat in Piscataway along with her neighbor Doreen Wilson. ‘I was inspired by the number of women who have recently been elected to Congress. I believe it is our time to shine.’ Butler added that no gender quota exists for any other political office in the state or country.” Read more here
WHAT'S NEXT FOR PATERSON, STALINGRAD? — “A renaissance in Paterson: filmmakers welcome,” by The Record’s Jim Beckerman: “""Look at this! said Marcia Sotorrio, Paterson's director of the division of cultural affairs, indicating the second floor of a bank building. ‘Look at this! Look at this! Look at that!’ Like a Kalashnikov spitting bullets, she points in rapid succession to scrolls, columns, carvings, cornices, balconies, fleur-de-lis ornamentation. ‘This is what filmmakers have discovered 25 minutes from New York,’ Sotorrio said. And that was just one building, on one street, on one day in Paterson — Thursday, March 28, the day that film crews were turning Colt Street into a replica of the 1940s Lodz ghetto for an Amazon TV series about Nazi hunters. ‘The Hunt,‘ starring Al Pacino and executive produced by Jordan Peele, is only one of many film projects scheduled to shoot in Paterson this year. This aging city of old silk mills, engine factories and a pretty spectacular waterfall has suddenly become the apple of Hollywood's eye. Some 23 productions, of all kinds, were filmed there in 2018, and this year is on track to equal or top it, Sotorrio said.” Read more here

In his recent Budget Address, Governor Murphy continued New Jersey’s commitment to pre-k expansion and proposed more funding for it – $68 million.
Governor Murphy, Senator Sweeney and Speaker Coughlin all support New Jersey’s high-quality, state-funded, full-day pre-k. As the governor has stated, “… together, we are fundamentally redefining public education with greater access to pre-k …”.
New Jersey’s state-funded, full-day pre-k is a national model – one of the highest quality public pre-k programs in the country. Until October 2017, only 35 of New Jersey’s hundreds of school districts provided it to their children. Today – thanks to legislative leadership and funding by the Murphy Administration – there are 113 school districts providing NJ’s pre-k to thousands more 3- and 4-year-olds --- and their working families!
New Jersey's been expanding pre-k. The governor's budget wants more funding. Hundreds of communities, tens of thousands of kids, are waiting.
It's time to significantly fund pre-k expansion – NOW! EVERYTHING ELSE
R.I.P. — “Bruce Deifik, former owner of Ocean Resort Casino, reported dead in Colorado,” by The Philadelphia Inquirer’s Amy S. Rosenberg: “Bruce Deifik, who blew through $70 million of his own money reopening the former Revel as the Ocean Casino Resort, died over the weekend in Denver in a car crash, according to reports. Deifik lost his stake in the property in January after the hedge fund Luxor took control of resort, which Deifik purchased from Florida investor Glenn Straub for $229 million. The casino closed in 2014 after a series of bankruptcies. Deifik was to face a hearing Wednesday in Atlantic City in front of casino regulators, who were seeking to strip him of his key casino license because of allegations of sexual harassment by female employees of Ocean Resort Casino.” Read more here
HIGHER ED — Rutgers faculty union sounding ‘final warning’ as strike threat looms, by Linh: Fed up with the lack of progress in contract negotiations that began more than a year ago, hundreds of faculty members, graduate workers and their supporters plan to picket outside the Rutgers University Board of Governors meeting in Newark on Tuesday, sounding a “final warning” as the threat of a strike looms.

Geese also like getting to the other side of the road. However, the birds are finding it harder to do so due to humans driving too fast and hitting them. Mia Fitzmaurice, 13, and Nicole Ensmann, 14, members of Bergenfield Girl Scouts Troop No. 94739, think a ‘Geese Crossing’ sign is needed.

Texas Tech medical school will end use of race in admissions,www.politico.com,BENJAMIN WERMUND,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/09/texas-tech-medical-school-race-admissions-3048529,"Texas Tech University's medical school will stop considering race in admissions under an agreement with the Trump administration — which said a lengthy investigation sparked ""concerns"" about the school's use of race.
It marks the first time the administration — which has targeted affirmative action — has reached a resolution in a probe of the use of race in admissions and could foretell how it will proceed with ongoing investigations into affirmative action policies at Harvard and Yale.
The agreement ends a 14-year probe by the Education Department's Office for Civil Rights into Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center's use of race in admissions.
The civil rights office said in a separate document that its investigation raised a series of concerns about the medical school's use of race, including that it ""may not be narrowly tailored"" as required by Supreme Court precedent and that the medical school ""may not subject its race-conscious admissions policy to appropriate periodic review."" The school also ""could not articulate how/when race is used,"" the office said.
The documents were posted online by Roger Clegg, president and general counsel of the Center for Equal Opportunity, a non-profit that opposes affirmative action. Clegg filed the initial complaint against Texas Tech in its entirety as well as its medical school.
Clegg's complaint against Texas Tech University was tossed out in November, because the university itself stopped considering race in 2014, the department wrote in a letter to Clegg.
The medical school, however, was still using race until earlier this year, and couldn't show that it had sufficiently ""considered whether its use of race-neutral alternative measures were sufficient, standing alone, to obtain the educational benefits that flow from student body diversity,"" the findings letter says.
Under the agreement, which Texas Tech accepted in February, its medical school will ""discontinue all consideration of an applicant's race and/or national origin"" in admissions. The school is also required to revise by September all admissions and recruiting materials so they don't include race as a factor.
In a letter agreeing to the resolution, the university insisted that it believes its admission process is in compliance with standards set by the Supreme Court, but that it was nonetheless willing to sign the agreement ""in an effort to resolve this matter and focus on educating future health care providers.""
""It shows again that the Trump administration is serious about enforcing the civil-rights laws so that they forbid discrimination against all racial and ethnic groups, and will not turn a blind eye toward politically correct racial discrimination in the way the Obama administration did,"" Clegg wrote in the National Review.
The agreement leaves the door open for the medical school to again use race in admissions, but says that it must ""ensure ... that it provides a reasoned, well principled explanation for its decision and identifies concrete and precise goals,"" among other things.
The Trump administration is separately investigating whether Harvard and Yale are discriminating against Asian-American applicants in their use of race in admissions.
The Justice Department has also backed a lawsuit targeting Harvard's use of race in admissions. And in July, the administration scrapped Obama-era guidance calling on school superintendents and colleges to consider race when trying to diversify their campuses.
The agreement was first reported by The Wall Street Journal."
Trump’s immigration plans face likely turbulence in courts,www.politico.com,TED HESSON,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/09/trump-family-separation-plan-1337151,"Trump’s immigration plans face likely turbulence in courts Federal courts have ruled repeatedly against President Donald Trump's most audacious policies on immigration. Share on Facebook Share on Twitter
President Donald Trump’s purge of top Homeland Security officials ignores the larger obstacle to his aggressive immigration agenda — the courts.
With DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen out of the way, and other officials in the department expected to be pushed out, White House senior adviser Stephen Miller hopes to accelerate or pursue more aggressive enforcement policies, including one that allows children to be detained more than 20 days and another that would deny green cards to immigrants who've received public assistance or are deemed likely to do so. Story Continued Below
Miller has also pressed to revive family separations at the border, though when asked about this Tuesday, the president said, ""We are not looking to do that, no.""
But even if Trump ""cleans house"" — a phrase he's never used, he told reporters Tuesday — he’ll still need to follow the law, and federal courts have ruled repeatedly against his most audacious policies on immigration.
“It’s just putting in someone who is willing to do it, but you’re still going to have the same obstacles,” said Lee Gelernt, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union who represents migrant parents in a major lawsuit over family separations.
In the most recent example, a San Francisco-based federal judge on Monday temporarily blocked Trump’s “remain in Mexico” initiative, which sought to force certain non-Mexican asylum-seekers to wait in Mexico until the conclusion of their case in the U.S. Get the latest on employment and immigration, every weekday morning — in your inbox.

Since Trump took office, his administration has launched a number of legally dicey policies intended to discourage or restrict the arrival of asylum seekers at the U.S.-Mexico border — only to see them waylaid by the courts.
Most prominent was the “zero tolerance” border policy, which ran from April to June of last year. The policy called for all suspected border crossers — including parents and asylum seekers — to be referred for federal prosecution. As parents were placed in custody of the U.S. Marshals Service and taken to court, their children were labeled “unaccompanied” and handed over to the Health and Human Services Department.
Thousands of children were separated from parents during the three-month period, prompting broad outrage. San Diego-based U.S. District Judge Dana Sabraw eventually ordered children in custody to be reunited with their parents. poster=""http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201904/191/1155968404_6024430941001_6024430527001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404"" true
U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Director Francis Cissna, who current and former DHS officials suggested could be removed in the coming days, appears to have drawn Miller's opposition by pursuing the Trump administration's policy goals in a more legally rigorous fashion.
“His methodical approach is the approach you actually need to do to get lasting change,” a former DHS official said of Cissna.
Should the Trump administration, despite the president's protestations, proceed with Miller's latest iteration of family separation at the border, detained parents will be given two options: separate from their children or remain together in detention indefinitely.
The ACLU's Gelernt learned about the policy details only from media reports, but he argued that offering parents a “cruel choice” between leaving a child or staying with that child in detention would be ruled unlawful.
“It’s really not a choice for these parents,” he said.
Possible venues for legal challenges to family separations would likely pose a problem for the Trump administration. poster=""http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201904/3335/1155968404_6024025780001_6024010856001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404""
In one scenario, the policy could become part of the ongoing lawsuit brought by the ACLU over family separations in San Diego. The case remains before Sabraw, an appointee of President George W. Bush.
Alternatively, parties in the so-called Flores agreement — which currently limits the time children can spend in detention to 20 days and mandates other standards for detention — also could seek to strike down a new separation push.
Even Mark Krikorian, an immigration hard-liner and executive director of the restrictionist Center for Immigration Studies, contends the Trump administration again should seek to prosecute parents, but should keep parents from being separated from children.
“That’s what caused the problem,” he said."
FP1 starts a new firm - POLITICO,www.politico.com,politico.com,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/newsletters/politico-influence/2019/04/09/fp1-starts-a-new-firm-422870," FP1 STARTS A NEW FIRM: FP1 Strategies is starting a new firm to handle its public affairs and corporate communications work, called PLUS Communications . FP1 will continue to handle the firm’s political consulting work. PLUS will be led by the same managing partners who head up FP1 — Danny Diaz , Jon Downs , Rob Jesmer and Terry Nelson — as well as Dave DenHerder , who’s moving over from FP1. “Since our founding in 2011, the firm has grown steadily from three experienced operatives to more than 80 communications professionals who have fought and won some of the country’s biggest campaigns — from the ballot to the Capitol to the boardroom,” Nelson said in a statement.
 The new firm will represent FP1 clients such as the American Hotel & Lodging Association , the Consumer Healthcare Products Association , Charter Communications and McDonald’s and will also handle crisis communications and grassroots work.
LOBBYISTS FUNDRAISING FOR DEMOCRATS WHO REJECT CORPORATE PAC MONEY: Freshman Rep. Gil Cisneros (D-Calif.) swore off corporate PAC money during his campaign, POLITICO ’s Theodoric Meyer reports. “But less than six months after winning election in a former Republican stronghold, Cisneros is not exactly keeping his distance from corporate special interests in Washington. Four lobbyists — who represent major corporate clients including AT&T , Comcast , Microsoft , Pfizer , Verizon and Wells Fargo — hosted a fundraiser for Cisneros late last month at a townhouse on Capitol Hill, according to a Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee list of fundraisers obtained by POLITICO.”
— “The lunchtime fundraiser, hosted by Ingrid Duran and Catherine Pino of D&P Creative Solutions and Dean Aguillen and Moses Mercado of Ogilvy Government Relations , brought in about $15,000 for Cisneros’ reelection campaign, according to a person familiar with the total. … The event didn’t violate Cisneros’ pledge to swear off corporate PAC money. But it illustrates a larger trend of Democratic lawmakers who have promised to steer clear of corporate PACs allowing the same corporations’ lobbyists to write them personal checks — and in some cases even host fundraisers for them.”
— Two of the lobbyists who hosted the Cisneros fundraiser, for instance, “also hosted one last month for Rep. Xochitl Torres Small (D-N.M.), another freshman who’s sworn off corporate PAC money, according to an invitation obtained by POLITICO. Freshman Rep. Cindy Axne (D-Iowa), meanwhile, held a fundraiser late last month at the offices of the Washington lobbying firm Cornerstone Government Affairs , which represents major corporations such as Boeing , Citigroup , Johnson & Johnson , Nike and United Airlines . ‘Rep. Axne does not take corporate PAC donations, but we are still very hopeful that our friends will show up to help in whatever capacity they can,’ Mike Goodman , a Cornerstone senior vice president, wrote in an email, which was obtained by POLITICO.” Full story .
ANNALS OF TAX-PREPARATION LOBBYING: “Congressional Democrats and Republicans are moving to permanently bar the IRS from creating a free electronic tax filing system,” realizing one of the for-profit tax preparation industry’s long-sought goals, ProPublica ’s Justin Elliott reports. “Last week, the House Ways and Means Committee, led by Rep. Richard Neal [(D-Mass.)], passed the Taxpayer First Act , a wide-ranging bill making several administrative changes to the IRS that is sponsored by” Reps. John Lewis (D-Ga.) and Mike Kelly (R-Pa.).
— “In one of its provisions, the bill makes it illegal for the IRS to create its own online system of tax filing. Companies like Intuit , the maker of TurboTax, and H&R Block have lobbied for years to block the IRS from creating such a system. If the tax agency created its own program, which would be similar to programs other developed countries have, it would threaten the industry’s profits.” Full story .
TAKEAWAYS FROM THE GAO REPORT ON LOBBYING DISCLOSURE: Bloomberg Government ’s Megan Wilson took a deeper dive in the new Government Accountability Office report on lobbyists’ compliance with the Lobbying Disclosure Act, which PI spotlighted last week . “So-called ‘shadow lobbyists’ can have long careers influencing Congress without ever registering or filing public reports because the government has so few people tracking compliance with disclosure laws. The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia, which is responsible for policing the lobbying industry, received nearly 3,800 referrals from the House and Senate about firms that potentially violated the law between 2009 and 2018.” More than half are still pending. Full story .
TRUMP MET WITH AT&T CEO: Randall Stephenson , AT&T ’s chief executive, “met with last week to discuss next-generation 5G networks, according to a source familiar with the meeting,” POLITICO ’s Margaret Harding McGill reports. “Trump hosted Stephenson to get a status report on the progress of AT&T and the broader wireless industry in their moves toward deploying 5G, the source said. Trump was also interested in gauging the industry's confidence in its ability to beat China in the race to build out next-generation networks, the person added.” Full story .
WALL STREET EXECUTIVES GIRD FOR WEDNESDAY’S HEARING: The House Financial Services Committee hearing set for Wednesday, at which Wall Street chief executives will testify, “has consumed big banks’ lobbying and public relations operations for weeks.” Bloomberg News ’ Robert Schmidt and Austin Weinstein have a preview: “They’ve compiled thick briefing binders on issues like small business lending and minority hiring, readied responses to pointed questions about pay and inequality, and conducted so-called murder boards — practice sessions where chief executive officers are cross-examined by a team pretending to be hostile members of Congress. But even with the extensive preparations, few predict that the executives will come out unscathed.” Full story .
FLYING IN: The National Beer Wholesalers Association has nearly 700 beer distributors in D.C. this week for a fly-in. They’ll meet with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell , Sens. Doug Jones (D-Ala.) and Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.) and Reps. Tom Cole (R-Okla.) and Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), among others.

BROADCASTERS FIGHTING TRUMP DRUG-PRICING RULE: “Broadcasting and advertising groups are adding a powerful voice to the fight against a controversial Trump administration proposal that would require drug companies to share prices in their commercials,” The Hill ’s Alex Gangitano reports. “Critics worry the new rules could discourage Big Pharma from advertising on air, costing the nation’s advertisers and television stations an important source of revenue.” Full story .

IF YOU MISSED IT ON MONDAY: “An American lobbyist who has admitted to paying $50,000 for a pro-Russian Ukrainian oligarch to attend ’s inauguration served as a ‘valuable resource’ for government investigators and deserves credit for that help at his upcoming sentencing, federal prosecutors said on Monday,” POLITICO ’s Darren Samuelsohn reports. “ W. Samuel Patten met or spoke by phone with prosecutors for special counsel Robert Mueller and other government investigators nine times as part of his cooperation agreement after pleading guilty last summer for failing to register as a foreign lobbyist in the U.S., according to the U.S. attorney’s office for the District of Columbia, which inherited the case from the special counsel.”
— “‘In all of these sessions, Patten has been honest and straightforward with government investigators,’ the government said in a court filing ahead of the lobbyist’s sentencing on Friday. The federal prosecutors’ sentencing memo largely holds back in describing exactly what Patten helped them on, explaining to U.S. District Court Judge Amy Berman Jackson that they’d file that material under seal because it “includes sensitive information about other investigations and persons who have not been (and may not be) charged with a crime.’” Full story .

The Incredible Shrinking Fox News - Magazine,www.politico.com,JACK SHAFER,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/04/09/fox-news-rupert-murdoch-226612,"The world-sprawling media empire Rupert Murdoch built on the soft foundation of two properties he inherited 66 years ago—the Adelaide News and a radio station in a New South Wales mining town—has begun to shrink like a tumor spritzed with chemo and toasted with radiation. Sighting his own end, the 88-year-old Murdoch has been tidying up his estate as if preparing it for probate. He just unloaded his movie studio, 21st Century Fox, in a $71.3 billion deal with Disney and sold his interest in satellite broadcaster Sky to Comcast. He also composed the final act in his version of King Lear , ending decades of speculation over which of his children would succeed him by crowning his son Lachlan as the new emperor of his remaining print and TV holdings, most conspicuous among them Fox News Channel, the most-watched news channel in America.
The media hasn’t fully digested the Murdoch wind down. Quite the contrary. In the past month, several of the nation’s top reporters expanded the media’s longstanding myth that Murdoch and Fox possess frightening clout. The New York Times Magazine devoted 20,000 words to Murdoch’s scary “empire of influence.” A New Yorker feature (12,000 words), “ The Making of the Fox News White House ,” elevated the network to the fourth branch of government. A 5,700-word ideological X-ray of Lachlan in the Intercept presents him as maybe the most reactionary of all the Murdochs.
But the clout of Fox News exists more in Democrats’ imagination than it does in reality, as media scholar Michael J. Socolow noted this week. From the beginning, Murdoch and Roger Ailes, his Fox News co-founder, made no secret of their ambition to elect a president of their choice, but year after year, they flunked the assignment. When he was the Republican presidential nominee in 2008, John McCain was vocal about not being in Rupert Murdoch’s pocket, saying he was “not a talk radio or Fox News Republican.” Fox failed to elevate McCain’s running mate, Sarah Palin, into electability after hiring her and backing her with supportive airtime. Mitt Romney won the 2012 presidential nod without Fox’s support while Murdoch’s fav, Rick Santorum , went nowhere after winning the Iowa caucuses. In 2016, runner-up Ted Cruz and also-ran Marco Rubio were Murdoch’s picks, as the New York Times Magazine article acknowledges.
Last time around, both Murdoch and Ailes opposed the candidacy of Donald Trump, with Murdoch once calling the future president a “ fucking idiot .” Murdoch’s New York Post and Wall Street Journal editorial pages hammered the Trump candidacy in the summer of 2015 and Murdoch wrote a $200,000 check to John Kasich’s super PAC, as the Times Magazine notes. Only when the “clouty” Fox proved powerless to prevent Trump’s nomination did Murdoch do what he always does after he fails to pick a winner. He hitched his wagon to the leader.
Without a doubt, Fox has amplified the Trump message over the first two years of his presidency, especially on Sean Hannity’s and Jeanine Pirro’s shows — and of course, Fox & Friends . And it’s true that Trump appears on the network with the frequency of a paid contributor, sitting for 41 interviews as president by the end of 2018, more than all the other major TV networks combined. And it’s worth mentioning that the network has defended the president from the Mueller investigation and other congressional and legal probes. But for all this plugging, Fox’s clout proved little help to Trump in the midterm elections, as the Democrats took the House of Representatives.
Fox’s minimal influence is easily explained. While it’s the most popular cable news network, it still draws only a niche audience. Socolow provides the numbers: On an average night, about 2.4 million prime-time viewers tune in, which is about 0.7 percent of the total U.S. population. “With numbers like these,” Socolow writes, “it’s no surprise that Fox News often chases its viewers rather than leading them. In other words: It’s more likely that Fox News caters to the preexisting partisanship of its small but loyal audience than that Fox News actually changes anybody’s mind.”
Having the ear of the president, as Murdoch does, makes him seem clouty. We learn from the Times Magazine piece that Trump not only takes Murdoch’s phone calls , he looks forward to them! But Murdoch has long vocally disagreed with Trump on Mexican immigrants , the Muslim ban , and trade agreements . “When is Donald Trump going to stop embarrassing his friends, let alone the whole country?” Murdoch tweeted in July 2015. Like all of Murdoch’s political entanglements , his support for Trump—and Trump’s support for him—remains conditional, expedient and self-interested. This is not what clout looks like.
Will Lachlan do anything to dull Fox’s partisan colors? Why would he? The channel generates about $2.7 billion a year for the company from its minuscule audience. Hollywood types and the intelligentsia who imagine that they can wish Fox away into a cornfield will have to up their shaming game if they expect to alter the network. Last fall in an Andrew Ross Sorkin Q&A session , Lachlan called himself “conservative economically and more liberal on social policy,” yet also said of the network, “I’m not embarrassed by what they do at all.” He promised no immediate change to the channel’s current lineup of hosts. Smart man. Any tampering with the formula would create a business opportunity for Sinclair Broadcast Group, One America News Network or other pro-Trump outlets.
“Are we retreating? Absolutely not!” a touchy Murdoch insisted in December 2017 when asked about his film company’s sale to Disney. “We are pivoting at a pivotal moment.”
As fibs go, it was a gentle one for somebody who would probably fall on his nose if actually asked to pivot. Paralleling the 88-year-old Murdoch’s waning ambition has been his accompanying physical decline. Chronically clumsy footwork has made him prey to a series of falls worthy of a stage-diver. Most recently, he broke a vertebra in a January 2018 tumble on Lachlan’s yacht.
Murdoch once told a biographer that his past “consists of a series of interlocking wars.” Viewed in that context, the trade of his film assets for a minority stake in Disney is Murdoch’s way of signaling a desire for peace as he prepares for his eternal reward as well as a vote of no confidence in his four adult children. How else to read his preference for Disney stock in the family treasury over letting his heirs run the Fox movie studio?
When Murdoch slips and falls the very last time, his will dictates that the company will go equally to his adult children. As Murdoch family biographers have long informed us, the kids don’t get along, which means they’ll probably fall on one other with axes and longbows when Dad’s end finally comes. But no matter who ends up owning Fox, be it a family member or an outsider, its clout will still be tiny. What might change with Murdoch’s death is that the rest of the media will finally be able to see his highly profitable and now modestly influential empire for what it is.

Democratic leader takes heat as anti-Semitism vote roils Florida,www.politico.com,GARY FINEOUT,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/states/florida/story/2019/04/09/democratic-leader-tries-to-explain-vote-against-anti-semitism-bill-958982,"
Sen. Audrey Gibson has been the lone vote against legislation to require schools and colleges to treat allegations of anti-Semitism the same as they would allegations of racial discrimination. | Steve Cannon/AP Images Democratic leader takes heat as anti-Semitism vote roils Florida Share on Facebook Share on Twitter
TALLAHASSEE — A state Democratic leader in Florida has come under withering criticism after she opposed a bill targeting anti-Semitism, a move that has energized Republican efforts to woo entrenched Jewish voters in the nation’s biggest battleground state.
State Sen. Audrey Gibson’s vote, and her ill-received defense of it on Tuesday, have Florida Republicans drawing comparisons to Reps. Ihlan Omar and Rashida Tlaib, congressional Democrats whose comments critical of Israel have caused firestorm in Washington. Florida Democrats, like their national counterparts, are sweating over the politics of how to respond. Story Continued Below
“It is sad that in the world propagated by Washington Democrats like Congresswomen Ihlan Omar and Rashida Tlaib and Tallahassee Democrats like Audrey Gibson, fighting anti-Semitism is ‘divisive‘,” state Rep. Randy Fine, a Jewish Republican and the bill ’s sponsor, wrote Tuesday.
Gibson, an African American and the state Senate’s top Democrat, caused a rift even among her own party members, many of whom are Jewish, as she tried to explain her decision to vote against the measure.
Florida GOP legislators pushed the anti-Semitism bill after Omar suggested in February that pro-Israel activists and lawmakers hold “allegiance to a foreign country.” The fallout from her comments divided Congress and gave state lawmakers an opportunity to take political advantage.
The legislation would require schools and colleges to treat allegations of anti-Semitism as they would allegations of racial discrimination. It would define anti-Semitism as “demonizing” or using “stereotypical allegations” against Jewish people, including the “myth about a world Jewish conspiracy.”
Anti-Semitic behavior would include “accusing Jewish citizens of being more loyal to Israel, or the alleged priorities of Jews worldwide, than to the interest of their own nations.""
The bill marks another effort by Republicans to make inroads with Florida’s sizable Jewish population, which has traditionally leaned Democratic and could play a pivotal role in another close presidential election in 2020.
As drama mounted over Gibson’s vote, Gov. Ron DeSantis on Tuesday said he would take a week-long trade mission to Israel in late May, an effort to live up to his pledge to be the “most pro-Israel governor in the country.”
The anti-Semitism bill had been moving smoothly through the House and Senate until a Monday committee hearing, when Gibson said she was concerned the proposal would grant “special protections” to one religion as opposed to all religions. She questioned the motives behind the bill , which is sponsored by Sen. Joe Gruters (R-Sarasota), chairman of the Republican Party of Florida.
“This kind of thing is what creates divisiveness in this country,” said Gibson, noting that African-American churches have been bombed. “It’s an intentional piece of legislation to divide.”
On Tuesday, Gibson, defended her vote, saying that the bill, while well-intentioned, “fails to protect the very constituencies that have been the subject of hate crimes in Florida, and in this country.”
“As it currently stands, this legislation fights the wrong battle, and targets the wrong enemy,” Gibson said in a written statement. “It restrains school children from making anti-Semitic statements, but removes culpability for those who actually carry out anti-Semitic hate crime attacks.”
The explanation didn’t satisfy critics, including those in her own party.
Sen. Annette Taddeo (D-Miami), a Jewish Democrat from South Florida, said she was “extremely disappointed” in Gibson. Lauren Book (D-Plantation), who is Jewish, called the legislation important in the wake of incidents such as the 2018 shooting in a Pittsburgh synagogue, where 11 people were killed.
“This is a very real threat,” said Book.
On Tuesday, Fine (R-Melbourne Beach) flatly rejected Gibson’s explanation on Twitter.
“Too late,” Fine wrote . “Folks should watch the tone and content of her questions and debate. To refuse to stand against anti-Semitism is unconscionable.” "

Legislators are expected to vote for J.B. Pritzker’s progressive income tax plan by the time the session ends in May. And you can expect the capital bill and budget to be approved at the same time, too.
That’s because Democratic leaders are subtly offering a piece of the capital bill to get votes for the progressive income tax. Lawmakers get a sense that they could be treated well in the capital bill if they vote in favor of a graduated income tax, which Pritzker calls “the fair tax.”
The constitutional change to secure the progressive income tax is expected to be introduced in the state Senate by next week for a first reading.
The message to lawmakers is that the capital bill won’t be possible without supporting the progressive income tax. “If we can’t put ourselves on a path to balance the budget, we can’t ask people to support the taxes necessary to fund a capital bill,” a Dem leader told POLITICO. Funding the capital bill would likely include a gas tax and license-plate fees.
House Speaker Mike Madigan, meanwhile, has been meeting individually with lawmakers over dinner at Saputo’s to hear their thoughts on the session. During those one-on-one conversations, members are telling him “things are moving too fast,” according to another Democrat. That explains how state Rep. Marty Moylan secured 60 signatures on a bill that calls for more study into recreational marijuana—another revenue generator proposed by Pritzker.
Slowing down or rejecting a revenue proposal has consequences. During a recent Democratic Caucus meeting, lawmakers were told that they’ve got to come up with areas in the budget to cut if Pritzker’s menu of revenue generators aren’t met. After going through that exercise, it’s expected the progressive income tax might be more appealing after all.

Ald. Carrie Austin wants to make one thing clear. She’s just fine with Mayor Lori Lightfoot moving in to the Fifth Floor of City Hall. The powerful alderman just doesn’t like Lightfoot’s marquee message—getting rid of aldermanic prerogative. Austin (34th) says her opposition to the idea doesn’t mean she’s organizing against Lightfoot. “I’m not,” she told POLITICO. But Austin, who oversees the Committee on Budget and Government Operations, has been outspoken on the issue, saying it’s essential to her ability to govern. She’s made that loud and clear to aldermen and media alike. At least a few council members interpret that as Austin “advocating for a strong council against the mayor.” Austin says not exactly. “I believe in both being strong. However, we may not agree on every issue.” Austin opposes ending aldermanic prerogative “because that’s opposing my community. It opposes my residents.” Her ward covers portions of Morgan Park, Roseland, Washington Heights and West Pullman on the South Side. Austin also is the ward’s Democratic committeewoman.

Gov. J.B. Pritzker and first lady of Illinois M.K. Pritzker hosted their first Passover Seder at the governor’s mansion last night. Other governors have held Seders in the mansion but he's the first Jewish governor to do so. About a hundred people attended—Jewish lawmakers, gubernatorial employees, rabbis from around the state and plenty of friends. The service was led by Seth Limmer, the Pritzkers’ rabbi from Temple Sinai. A fun moment in the evening saw rabbis break out into song as violinist Allison Zabelin played—she’s a cousin to state Rep. Sara Feigenholtz, who also attended.Other notables: Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton, Deputy Gov. Jesse Ruiz and his wife, attorney Michelle Ruiz; Consul General of Israel to the Midwest Aviv Ezra ; Holocaust survivor and chair of the board of the Illinois Holocaust Museum Fritzie Fritzshall; stateRep. Robyn Gabel, stateRep. Yehiel Kalish, stateRep. Bob Morgan, stateSen. Julie Morrison and state Sen. Ram Villivalam. The food was kosher and catered by Zelda’s in Skokie.

— It was pure theater in City Hall yesterday when Mayor Rahm Emanuel acquiesced to Mayor-elect Lori Lightfoot and asked the Finance Committee to hold off on voting on Lincoln Yards and The 78 development projects. The activists who helped elect Lightfoot cheered upon hearing the news. But Ald. Brian Hopkins (2 nd ), whose ward includes the 55-acre Lincoln Yards site, shot back. He told reporters: “The mayor doesn’t sit on the Finance Committee.” He called on the committee to vote anyway. All eyes shifted to lame-duck Ald. Pat O’Connor, who heads Finance. An Emanuel ally to the end, he pushed the pause button, saying the vote would take place Wednesday to give Emanuel and Lightfoot a chance to figure out how to “move forward.” Given aldermen have already voted in favor of the projects, minds aren’t likely to be changed. But there could be maneuvering that allows Lightfoot to get a little more out of the deal for the sake of her supporters. Sun-Times’ Fran Spielman has more details here . And here’s the Tribune’s take by John Byrne.
— Fair work week on hold. Some parliamentary maneuvering put the fair workweek proposal on hold yesterday. It was up for a vote in the Committee on Workforce Development and Audit. But it was 4:45 p.m. by the time Ald. Pat O’Connor (40 th ) arrived to the meeting. He called for a vote and then Ald. Tom Tunney (44 th ) called for a quorum. By that hour, they didn’t have it. So O’Connor adjourned the meeting. That means the issue will be taken up by the new city council after the May 20 inauguration.

Facebook Twitter LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Comment Print EU and Chinese officials meeting in Brussels on Tuesday proclaimed their summit as a win-win, but far more striking was the big loser: Donald Trump.
European Council President Donald Tusk declared a ""breakthrough"" on some of the EU's major trade disagreements — including a joint pledge to back tough World Trade Organization rules on industrial subsidies. Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said: ""Today, we are making good on our joint commitment to uphold and to update the rules-based global order that has served us so well.""
And Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang, appearing at a news conference with Tusk and Juncker, declared the agreements reached at the summit ""something good for China's reform and opening-up endeavors, and good for European unity and prosperity.""
While Li and his European counterparts were celebrating what he called ""concrete goals and outcomes,"" a newspaper close to the Chinese Communist Party cast doubt on Trump's suggestion that he would reach a deal to end his trade war with China within four weeks.
The newspaper, the Global Times, which is affiliated with the People's Daily, the official publication of the party's central committee, published an editorial calling Trump's prediction ""just an uncertain timetable"" and it warned that any effort to force through a deal could have serious negative consequences, the South China Morning Post reported .
""The word you have heard most here today is reciprocity"" — Senior EU diplomat
In Brussels, during a series of summit meetings at which officials worked hard to focus on common interests, perhaps the foremost imperative for Brussels and Beijing was to showcase the failure of Trump's belligerence — his slapping of unilateral tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods and his threats of punitive levies against EU-made automobiles — in achieving real gains for the U.S. vis-à-vis the world's biggest trading powers.
Last week, Tusk urged EU leaders not to support a joint statement with China, saying there has not been sufficient cooperation from the Chinese side to address European concerns on a range of issues. But an intense 72 hours of negotiations led to key breakthroughs, particularly on the issue of industrial subsidies, as well as on geographical indications , and it yielded a robust joint statement .

Gillibrand: I was wrong on immigration - POLITICO,www.politico.com,MATTHEW CHOI,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/09/kirsten-gillibrand-immigration-wrong-1264199,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter
Democratic presidential hopeful Kirsten Gillibrand on Tuesday confronted some of her previous stances on immigration, saying they ""didn't care"" about the needs of diverse Americans.
""When I was a member of Congress from upstate New York, I was really focused on the priorities of my district,"" the New York senator said during a CNN town hall. ""When I became senator of the entire state, I recognized that some of my views really did need to change."" Story Continued Below
Before becoming a senator in 2009, Gillibrand represented a largely Republican district in the House and expressed ideas on immigration — from blocking certain benefits for undocumented immigrants to establishing English as an official language — that have come back to haunt her as she seeks the Democratic nomination in 2020.
Those old stances especially corrode her platform as the antithesis of President Donald Trump, who has made harsher penalties and stricter enforcement of immigration laws a cornerstone of his campaign and administration.
During the town hall, Gillibrand said she has changed considerably since her times in the House, and that she was ""ashamed"" of her past positions. She used her ideological evolution to further distance herself from the president, who she said is incapable of change."

Oil drilling plan threatens Trump's 2020 chances in Florida,www.politico.com,,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/10/trump-florida-2020-oil-drilling-1264194,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter
The Trump administration is considering auctioning off Florida’s coastal waters for oil and gas drilling — and Republicans are warning it could cost the president dearly in Florida in the 2020 election.
An industry lobbying offensive has put it on the cusp of achieving its holy grail: access to the resource-rich eastern Gulf of Mexico. The idea is so politically toxic in Florida that past presidents haven't even entertained it. But behind the scenes, oil and gas interests are appealing to Trump's desire to turbocharge U.S. energy production, including his past openness to drilling off the Florida coast. Story Continued Below
The president and his top advisers haven't yet weighed in on the plan taking shape inside his Interior Department. But giving it the green light would be tantamount to a declaration of war on his second home state, given the uniform opposition from Florida Republicans, including prominent allies like Sen. Rick Scott, Gov. Ron DeSantis and others.
“He would have a price to pay for that,” Rep. Ted Yoho (R-Fla.), a staunch Trump supporter, told POLITICO.
Industry representatives have said a plan has been imminent since last fall, but many expect the Interior Department is waiting for the Senate to confirm acting Secretary David Bernhardt to fill the agency's top slot before formally releasing the draft. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell filed cloture Monday on Bernhardt’s confirmation, teeing up a vote this week.
Multiple oil and gas industry sources told POLITICO that the eastern Gulf, along with the Atlantic coast, are included in the administration’s current five-year off-shore drilling proposal, which hasn’t yet been released. The deliberations surrounding that plan are occurring mostly at Interior between lower-level policy aides who are being lobbied by industry representatives, they said.

The administration's position was muddied when former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke held an elaborately staged Jan. 2018 meeting with Scott, then Florida's governor, to declare the state wouldn’t be on the drilling map. The announcement was seen as a favor to boost Scott’s electoral fortunes in his ultimately successful challenge against Democratic incumbent Bill Nelson, who tried to use environmental issues to separate himself from the Republican challenger.
In reality, Trump was upset by the announcement. People familiar with his reaction said Zinke’s statement came without White House approval and contradicted the administration’s “energy dominance” message.
Both parties in Florida oppose offshore drilling. Memories of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill, which sent tarballs ashore in Florida, bring fears of a future spill damaging the state’s fisheries and tourism. Many in the state also say drilling would conflict with military exercises in the area.
Bernhardt has stayed mum about what’s in the offshore leasing proposal, remarking in a March 28 confirmation hearing that the department is at “step one” of the process. Several industry sources disputed that, though, saying the plan is nearly complete.
“For all intents and purposes, it’s done,” said an industry lobbyist familiar with the plan.
But the senior political officials charged with protecting Trump’s electoral prospects haven’t yet focused on the drilling plan, said a source close to the president who met recently with members of Trump’s energy policy team.
The White House referred a request for comment to the Interior Department. An agency spokesperson did not immediately reply to questions about whether the eastern Gulf of Mexico would be included in any draft plan. Bernhardt said at his nomination hearing that the latest draft plan hadn’t reached his desk.
Offshore drilling is broadly unpopular in Florida. A Quinnipiac University poll of Florida voters released March 13 showed 64 percent oppose the practice. Republicans, though, supported it by a 54-38 percent margin. A ballot measure banning oil and gas development in state waters passed overwhelmingly in November."
Inside the (semi-)secret society for young Trump staffers - POLITICO,www.politico.com,msn.com,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/10/45-club-donald-trump-staffers-1264198,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter
On the first Wednesday evening in February, Anthony Scaramucci entertained a packed house of like-minded souls at Rewind, a retro diner off Dupont Circle.
There, the former White House communications director fielded friendly questions and made cracks about his intra-Trump world vendettas against rivals like Steve Bannon, Sean Spicer and Reince Priebus. Story Continued Below
The occasion was a meetup of the 45 Club, a private group reserved exclusively for President Donald Trump’s current and former staffers.
The club, an informal gathering that provides solidarity and networking opportunities in a hostile Washington, is open to what it calls “the Team” — Trump administration appointees as well as alumni of the campaign, transition and inaugural committee. Members wear a lapel pin fashioned after the butt end of a .45 caliber bullet casing and attend semi-regular gatherings that often feature remarks by better-known Trump-world figures such as Brad Parscale, Corey Lewandowski and Scaramucci.

Its operations, described here for the first time, offer insight into how the anonymous foot soldiers of Trump’s Washington have organized their social lives: discreetly, with an eye toward exclusivity and the aspirational lifestyle that has always marked the Trump brand.
Not quite a secret society, the club nonetheless goes to some lengths to fly under the radar: Public hints of its existence are scarce, and the locations of its events are withheld from attendees until they RSVP, all the better to evade the notice of pesky activists and nosy reporters. “In this political climate, there’s a lot of people who would not have pure intentions of coming to network,” explained a former campaign staffer familiar with the club. “They may be trying to infiltrate.”

While it is common for veterans of presidential campaigns and administrations to form alumni groups, the 45 Club has taken on an outsized role as a refuge for junior operatives and appointees who have few connections in the capital. Barack Obama’s young staffers were the toast of Washington, and George W. Bush rode into town with a clubby, multi-generational political network that was heavy on the GOP establishment. But, in a reflection of his outsider campaign, Trump’s hires often came from outside the traditional feeding grounds of Republican politics. And in a city that has largely shunned them — dating app profiles here often declare an unwillingness to meet Trump’s supporters, let alone his aides — Trump’s young aides have formed an insular social scene.
“When you’ve kept the Washington Illuminati at a distance, I think you’re more likely to form groups of your own,” explained one club member.
Of course, because this is the Trump administration, there has been infighting: The 45 Club has been the subject of internecine sniping over charges that it is run by hangers-on bent on exploiting their tenuous connections to the president.
“They’re trying to create an exclusive club because they’ve been banned from every other exclusive club in D.C.,” sniped one former campaign staffer.
“Ironically enough, the two guys who started it were never on the campaign, never in the administration,” lamented Kevin Chmielewski, a member of the campaign’s advance team who went on to serve at the Environmental Protection Agency. “We were all kind of pissed about it, because it’s like, ‘Who are you to do that?’”"

The president and his allies are providing Democrats plenty of fodder as they enter day four of massive upheaval at the Department of Homeland Security with seemingly no plan to deal with asylum-seekers on the U.S.-Mexico border. While some might want Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer to take advantage of the chaos, in reality, sitting on their hands is the only sound political strategy at the moment. As for the 2020 candidates, what’s the upside of weighing in?
THERE’S A POLITICAL TRUISM that seems to fit quite well here: Never get in the way of your opponent when he’s making a mistake.
NEW … HOUSE MINORITY WHIP STEVE SCALISE (R-LA.) is beginning the process to try to force a vote on an anti-BDS bill, as Republicans look to use Israel as a wedge to split Democrats. SCALISE is using the only tool the minority has -- a discharge petition -- to try to force Democrats to sign onto “Strengthening America’s Security in the Middle East Act of 2019” -- the House version of a bill the Senate has already passed.
The legislation would allow “states to divest from entities boycotting Israel.” The idea is to try to force vulnerable Democrats to sign the petition. It needs 218 signatures to reach the floor. All 197 Republicans are sure to sign on, which means 21 Democratic signatures are needed. Discharge petitions rarely work, but this is tailor-made for campaign season.
THE TICK TOCK … WAPO’S DAVID NAKAMURA, JOSH DAWSEY and SEUNG MIN KIM: “Twelve days of chaos: Inside the Trump White House’s growing panic to contain the border crisis”: “Trump’s increasingly erratic behavior over the past 12 days — since he first threatened to seal the border in a series of tweets on March 29 — has alarmed top Republicans, business officials and foreign leaders who fear that his emotional response might exacerbate problems at the border, harm the U.S. economy and degrade national security.
“The stretch also has revealed that a president who has routinely blamed spiking immigration numbers on others — past presidents, congressional Democrats, Mexican authorities, federal judges, human smugglers — is now coming to the realization that the problems are closer to home. Though his aides have taken the fall, and it is unlikely that Trump will blame himself, the president is facing an existential political crisis ahead of his 2020 reelection bid over the prospect of failure on his top domestic priority.” WaPo
NYT, A1: PETER BAKER and MAGGIE HABERMAN: “Mick Mulvaney Tries Letting Trump Be Trump”: “In his first 100 days as the president’s acting chief of staff, Mr. Mulvaney has assumed a central role in Mr. Trump’s circle but one markedly different than the previous two occupants of his corner office. For the first time since taking office, Mr. Trump has a chief of staff who has made it his job to encourage rather than restrain the president’s conservative instincts — to let Trump be Trump, in effect. …
“During tense negotiations amid the government shutdown earlier this year, Senator Richard C. Shelby, the Alabama Republican and Appropriations Committee chairman, complained bitterly about Mr. Mulvaney’s penchant for undoing weeks of bipartisan work with a quick comment to Mr. Trump in the Oval Office. Mr. Shelby told Senator Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, the committee’s top Democrat, that Mr. Mulvaney was ‘the most dangerous man’ in Washington, according to three people familiar with the exchange.
“Mr. Shelby has not repeated that in public, but when a reporter on Capitol Hill asked him about Mr. Mulvaney last week, the senator tartly interrupted to offer a correction. ‘You mean the acting chief of staff?’ he said before walking away.” NYT

ELIANA JOHNSON and DANIEL LIPPMAN, “Inside Trump’s ‘truly bizarre’ visit to Mt. Vernon”: “President Donald Trump had some advice for George Washington. During a guided tour of Mount Vernon last April with French president Emmanuel Macron, Trump learned that Washington was one of the major real-estate speculators of his era. So, he couldn’t understand why America’s first president didn’t name his historic Virginia compound or any of the other property he acquired after himself.
“‘If he was smart, he would’ve put his name on it,’ Trump said, according to three sources briefed on the exchange. ‘You’ve got to put your name on stuff or no one remembers you.’ The VIPs’ tour guide for the evening, Mount Vernon president and CEO Doug Bradburn, told the president that Washington did, after all, succeed in getting the nation’s capital named after him. Good point, Trump said with a laugh. ... The Macrons, Bradburn has told several people, were far more knowledgeable about the history of the property than the president.” POLITICO

“The outcome affirmed Israel’s continued tilt to the right and further dimmed hopes of a negotiated solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Re-election will also give Netanyahu an important boost as he braces for the likelihood of criminal charges in a series of corruption scandals.
“With 97.4% of the vote counted, Likud and its traditional political allies were in command of a 65-55 majority in parliament.

While there were no major bombshells revealed during yesterday’s hearing (which was supposed to be focused on the DOJ’s budget), Barr’s first public appearance did provide a couple of newsy nuggets. Here are the big takeaways:
Timing: Robert Mueller’s report is expected to be handed over to Congress “within a week”, said Barr, which would put its release over the two-week recess. Democrats are contemplating coming back to Washington if that happens. Incomplete : Barr said lawmakers will be getting a redacted version of the report, saying Congress does not have a right to view sensitive grand jury information — which has infuriated Democrats. But so far, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) is holding his fire on a subpoena, report Andrew and Kyle. Declined : Mueller rebuffed a chance to review Barr’s summary of the report before the attorney general sent the letter to Congress. This comes amid reports that some members of the special counsel’s team were frustrated with how Barr summarized the findings. Bias : Barr said he is looking into GOP claims that the origins of the Russia probe were politically motivated. And the attorney general has already assembled a team to review the FBI’s actions in the investigation, reports Bloomberg.

TELL ‘EM BOY, BYE -- House Democrats were forced to cancel an expected vote on a key budget measure because it was facing opposition from both corners of the caucus, report Sarah, Heather and Bres. Progressives, who have been looking to flex their muscles in the new majority, threatened to tank the bill — which would have set federal spending levels — if it didn’t include more money for domestic programs. Moderates, meanwhile, were concerned about the plan’s price tag.
Budget chief John Yarmuth (D-Ky.) said he isn’t giving up on the bill quite yet. But it still represents a major setback for Democratic leaders as they head into their annual conference retreat this week and celebrate their first 100 days in power. It also sets an ominous tone for future budget battles, where lawmakers will need to negotiate with the GOP to lift budget caps and raise the debt ceiling. Much more: https://politi.co/2X1RLVV .

COMING ATTRACTIONS -- Republicans are eager to keep Democratic divisions over Israel in the spotlight. House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) will start the process today to file a so-called “discharge petition” on legislation condemning anti-Israel boycotts and sanctions, an aide tells your Huddle host. Once the petition is filed in May, they can begin collecting signatures to force a floor vote on the bill. While petitions are a long shot and require 218 signatures to work, Republicans think they can peel off a significant number of Democrats on the issue — and expose some major rifts in the Dem party in the process.
NO CAIN, NO GAIN -- It looks Herman Cain’s nomination to the Federal Reserve is in serious trouble. Republicans have been urging Trump to drop the nomination, warning he will face a difficult confirmation process. Burgess lays out all the reasons why: Cain runs a pro-Trump super PAC and is viewed as a partisan pick, he has been accused of sexual harassment and the GOP is already concerned by Trump’s other nomination to the Fed, Stephen Moore.

TURN TEXAS BLUE -- The House Democratic campaign arm is setting up shop in Texas, the latest sign that the Lone Star state will be a major House battleground in 2020. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee announced that it will be opening a new satellite office in Austin, which Democrats hope will help them play offense in the increasingly purple state. Why Democrats are optimistic: they flipped two Texas House seats in the last election, while former Rep. Beto O’Rourke (D-Texas) nearly won a Senate seat.

TAX SEASON -- Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told lawmakers that department lawyers have talked with the White House about Democratic demands for Trump’s tax returns, reports Aaron Lorenzo.

Trump to unveil pipeline push - POLITICO,www.politico.com,politico.com,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-energy/2019/04/10/trump-to-unveil-pipeline-push-423333,"With help from Alex Guillén President Donald Trump will unveil executive action today aimed at speeding up the permitting process for pipelines — likely launching another political fight between the administration and blue-state governors.
— Committees in both the House and Senate will take up a spate of energy bills today on energy efficiency and carbon capture and sequestration technologies.
— Bipartisan senators have unveiled new legislation to permanently fund the Land and Water Conservation Fund, hoping to squash reoccurring debates over appropriations levels.
WELCOME TO WEDNESDAY! Tamborrino. ClearPath's Darren Goode knew former President William Henry Harrison was the only president who studied to become a doctor. For today: How many states have sent three women to the Senate? TRUMP'S PIPELINE PUSH: The president is in Texas today to unveil long-expected executive orders aimed at speeding up pipeline permitting. The administration is targeting the ability of governors like New York's Andrew Cuomo to use the Clean Water Act to block or delay pipelines and other infrastructure projects, as Pro's Ben Lefebvre and Annie Snider report . Trump will direct EPA to update guidance on states' authority under the Clean Water Act and to begin work on a more formal regulation aimed at ending ""confusion and uncertainty"" about how states are implementing it, a senior administration official told reporters Tuesday. But it would be up to Congress to fundamentally alter that authority, dampening the effect of today's order.
The order also targets activist investors that have pressed oil companies like Exxon Mobil to address climate change, directing the Labor Department to look into whether such funds are complying with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. ""The focus of ERISA plan is retirement savings and not other social and political goals,"" the official said.
Trump will sign a second order giving himself ""inherent authority"" over foreign affairs, including cross-border infrastructure permits such as the new one issued last month for the Keystone XL pipeline.
HEADS UP: Questions over the orders could come up today when Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works R.D. James testifies on the Army Corps of Engineers' budget before the Senate Appropriations Energy-Water Subcommittee.
— Also ahead of the announcement, Senate Environment and Public Works Chairman John Barrasso reintroduced S. 1087, the ""Water Quality Certification Improvement Act of 2019."" The bill would narrow the scope of Section 401 of the Clean Water Act to limit it to water quality impacts only, and would clarify that states can only consider discharges from federally permitted or licensed activity, not from other sources.

AROUND THE AGENCIES EPA TAKING COMMENT ON CASAC NOMINEES: Nine scientists have been nominated to the single open seat on the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee, and EPA will take public comment on them until April 30, after which Administrator Andrew Wheeler makes the final pick. The seat opened up after Timothy Lewis retired from the Army Corps of Engineers and asked to leave his CASAC term early. Whoever Wheeler picks will help review the agency's science in ongoing reviews of the ozone and particulate matter standards; CASAC members have been critical of EPA in both cases in recent months.
Who's who: Several of the nominees have experience with ozone, most notably Danica Lombardozzi of the National Center for Atmospheric Research, who founded a citizen science ozone data collection project. Seven of the nominees are university professors; the ninth is Bill Jackson, a recent retiree from the U.S. Forest Service, where he worked on air pollution for decades.
ON THE HILL TOP BILLING: The House Energy and Commerce Energy Subcommittee will hold a hearing this morning on ""investing in America's energy infrastructure,"" where lawmakers will look at several bills related to energy efficiency and a diverse workforce. Assistant DOE Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Dan Simmons and James Campos, director of DOE’s Office of Economic Impact and Diversity, will testify.
One of the bills, H.R. 1315 (116) , from subcommittee Chairman Bobby Rush , would improve workforce-training programs in the energy industry and make it easier for workers to receive wages while they're going through training.
Expect pushback from Republicans on the measure over concerns the bill echoes the Obama administration's green jobs program and uses the term ""minority"" instead of ""underrepresented,"" which Republicans say excludes women and veterans. Previous iterations of the bill also included contributions from Rep. Richard Hudson , who told POLITICO last month he was excluded from this year's bill.
Also this morning: The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee will mark up a bill, S. 383 (116) , from Barrasso to support carbon dioxide utilization and direct air capture research, and another from ranking member Tom Carper , S. 747 (116) , to reauthorize the diesel emissions reduction program.
MOVING ALONG: A second House committee advanced Democrats' bill, H.R. 9 (116) , calling on the U.S. to re-enter the Paris climate accord, Pro's Zack Colman reports . No Republicans voted in support of the measure.
SENATORS INTRODUCE LWCF BILL: Senate Energy ranking member Joe Manchin and Republican Sen. Cory Gardner introduced legislation Tuesday that would provide full, mandatory funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund at a level of $900 million. The bill introduced Tuesday and backed by 12 bipartisan senators would nix the requirement that funds must be appropriated. It comes after a year of ups and downs for the landmark conservation program that only recently received permanent reauthorization, while expenditures are left subject to the appropriations process. Read the bill text .
PIPELINE SAFETY GETS SENATE LOOK: The Senate Commerce Transportation and Safety Subcommittee will hold a hearing on pipeline safety this afternoon following a similar hearing last week in the House. Howard ""Skip"" Elliott, administrator of the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, and Robert Sumwalt, chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, will testify today, alongside representatives of the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America and American Petroleum Institute.
CONFIRMED: The Senate confirmed Patrick Wyrick, Trump's district judge pick for the Western District of Oklahoma, on Tuesday by a 53-47 vote. The former state solicitor general and friend of former EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt received pushback from greens and Democrats, including Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse , who said Tuesday that Wyrick built his career as a ""go-between for fossil fuel interests and disgraced polluter errand boy Scott Pruitt.""
PFAS BILL TO BE INTRODUCED: Sens. Jeanne Shaheen and Mike Rounds are expected to reintroduce the bipartisan ""PFAS Registry Act"" today, which would create a national database for service members and veterans experiencing health problems potentially linked to PFAS contamination. Bill text .
MAILBAG CARPER, PETERS QUESTION DOI ETHICS: Carper and Sen. Gary Peters sent a new letter to acting Interior Secretary David Bernhardt expressing concern over the department's ethics in light of a recent report from the Government Accountability Office that pointed to shortcomings in the program. The report coupled with calls for multiple inspector general investigations ""lead us to question the leadership commitment to ethics within the Department,"" the senators wrote .
They call for further information on the steps Interior is taking to respond to the GAO report's recommendations, the career ethics officials Bernhardt plans to hire by this year, and the role of the White House in ethics requirements.
— Related: Western Values Project Action, a left-leaning conservation group, launched a six-figure ad campaign in New Mexico targeting Sen. Martin Heinrich after his surprise flip in support of Bernhardt last week. The ad calls on Heinrich to oppose Bernhardt's nomination on the Senate floor.
WHAT'S THE PLAN? Democratic Sens. Jeff Merkley and Maggie Hassan urged GAO to look into the risks associated with fossil fuel investments by federal workers. The senators call specific attention to a lack of anticipated climate risks in the federal Thrift Savings Plan, which is a 401(k) equivalent program available to federal employees. ""This inaction places the assets and retirement security of its participants in jeopardy,"" they write .

FBI brass discussed possibility Trump fired Comey 'at the behest of' Russia,www.politico.com,KYLE CHENEY,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/10/fbi-trump-comey-russia-1264700,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter
James Baker, the former top lawyer of the FBI, said senior bureau officials — including at least one deemed to be free of anti-Trump bias — discussed the possibility in May 2017 that President Donald Trump had fired FBI Director James Comey “at the behest of” the Russian government.
In testimony to two Republican-led committees last October, Baker described mounting concerns that crystallized in the frantic days after the FBI director’s ouster, days that were punctuated by Trump’s on-air declaration that he fired Comey because of the Russia probe and his chummy Oval Office meeting with senior Russian officials, at which he reportedly trashed Comey as a “nut job.” Story Continued Below
Baker described a discussion in those turbulent days that he had with Andrew McCabe — who became acting FBI director after Comey’s departure — and the bureau’s top counterintelligence official Bill Priestap, as well as top national security official Carl Ghattas. He also said it was possible that bureau attorney Lisa Page and counterintelligence agent Peter Strzok — whose anti-Trump text messages have drawn attention from Trump and Republicans — attended the meeting as well.
“So there was — there was a discussion between those folks, possibly all of the folks that you’ve identified, about whether or not President Trump had been ordered to fire Jim Comey by the Russian government?” asked Rep. John Ratcliffe (R-Texas), one of the committee members interviewing Baker. Sign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.

“I wouldn’t say ordered. I guess I would say ... acting at the behest of and somehow following directions, somehow executing their will,” he said. “[A]nd so literally an order or not, I don’t know.”
His comments, some of which have been revealed in news reports in recent months, were included in a 152-page transcript of Baker’s testimony to the House Oversight and Judiciary committees in October 2018, when Republicans led an investigation into the handling of the FBI’s Russia probe. The transcript was released Tuesday and Wednesday by the panel’s top Republican, Rep. Doug Collins (R-Ga.), who has been incrementally entering testimony from last year’s investigation into the congressional record.
Though Republicans have questioned whether senior FBI officials were collectively biased against Trump — especially McCabe, Strzok and Page — investigators probing questions about bias have noted that there’s “ no evidence” of bias on Priestap’s part. McCabe, Strzok and Page have also denied that their personal views of Trump affected their decisions at the FBI. In the past year, McCabe and Strzok were both fired amid the scrutiny, and Page left the bureau as well. Priestap left the FBI at the end of 2018.
Baker’s comments are also newly relevant as Attorney General William Barr prepares to release a redacted version of special counsel Robert Mueller’s report on links between Russian and Trump’s 2016 campaign.
Mueller examined whether Trump attempted to obstruct the probe, and Baker’s testimony provides a window into the FBI’s view of that question in the immediate days following Comey’s firing. Mueller, according to a limited excerpt revealed by Barr, declined to reach a “traditional prosecutorial judgment” on whether Trump obstructed justice, but Mueller’s analysis has not been revealed.
Baker said the discussion among the top officials was meant to discuss the range of possibilities behind Trump’s firing of Comey. Acting at Russia’s urging “was one extreme,” he said.
“The other extreme is that the president is completely innocent, and we discussed that too,” Baked noted. “And so — and then you have things in the middle. And so —— so that was how it came up. There’s a range of things this could possibly be. We need to investigate, because we don’t know whether, you know, the worst-case scenario is possibly true or the president is totally innocent and we need to get this thing over with — and so he can move forward with his agenda.”
Baker’s description of this “hypothetical” concern about Trump acting at Russia’s behest also indicated to lawmakers that there were widespread concerns inside the FBI that Trump had attempted to obstruct the bureau’s investigation into his campaign’s links to Russians, according to a newly releasedtranscript of Baker’s testimony.
Under questioning in 2018 by a Democratic committee lawyer, Baker described numerous officials who were distressed that the president might have obstructed justice when he fired Comey in May 2017. Baker said he had personal concerns and that they were shared by not just top FBI brass but within other divisions and at the Justice Department as well."
Trouble at the federal CIO’s office - POLITICO,www.politico.com,politico.com,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-cybersecurity/2019/04/10/trouble-at-the-federal-cios-office-577520,"With help from Eric Geller, Martin Matishak and Alexandra S. Levine
 The Office of the Federal Chief Information Officer is afflicted by low morale and confusion about a reorganization. The office helps agencies upgrade their cyber defenses.
— Two out of every three hotel websites leak guests’ personal data. Symantec found a number of reasons why security is poor.
— The Justice Department wants money for countering foreign influence, defending national assets and cyber information sharing. The department detailed its requests in a congressional hearing.
HAPPY WEDNESDAY Do not click on this unless you are prepared to be horrified.
Driving the Day NOT A GREAT SIGN — The White House office that helps agencies upgrade their IT systems and improve cybersecurity is floundering amid low morale, confusion about a recent reorganization and grumbling about inaccessible leaders, Eric reported in a story for Pros published Tuesday. The Office of the Federal Chief Information Officer, housed within OMB, is grappling with “high turnover,” “a lot of infighting,” a “crushing workload” and “inaction from leadership,” according to a current OMB employee familiar with the situation. The employee said there was “real concern at the staff level that if this continues, something bad will happen and we won’t be ready for it.”
OFCIO employees aren’t getting enough clarity from leadership about what their priorities should be, according to sources and internal staff survey data obtained by POLITICO — a major problem in a 30-person office constantly overwhelmed by the magnitude of federal IT issues. The November reorganization, conducted after an outside consultant recommended major changes to the long-beleaguered office, only increased confusion and frustrations. Employees from other OMB offices and other agencies regularly seek guidance that OFCIO staffers can’t provide, because key issues remain unresolved.
The turmoil could eventually disrupt efforts to coordinate government-wide security upgrades, according to the OMB employee, five former OFCIO staffers and three former senior IT and cyber officials. “This organization looks like it’s in free fall,” said one former official. Pros can read the story here .
CAPTAIN OBVIOUS: ‘THIS IS BAD’ — Two out of every three hotel websites unwittingly share guests’ personal data, including credit card information and passport numbers, to third-party sites, according to research out today from Symantec. Hackers could use that information to track a person’s movements and potentially grant them physical access to a victim’s location, the firm warns.
The breaches occur for a variety of reasons, including the fact that 57 percent of hotel websites send a confirmation email to customers with a direct access link to their booking that also features ads, which allows the direct sharing of information with others. Meanwhile, only 29 percent of sites used encrypted links, which could allow a potential attacker to steal customer credentials. The research was based on an analysis of more than 1,500 hotels in 54 countries spread across five continents, according to Symantec.
THE SAUCE ON DDoS — With cryptomining benefits on the decline, cyber attackers were more inclined to employ DDoS attacks in 2018, according to a report out this morning from NSFOCUS. However, the total number of DDoS attacks fell 28 percent from 2017, the company found. Most used DDoS only, but 13 percent combined attack methods. And of all attack types, 25 percent of attackers were repeat offenders responsible for 40 percent of attacks.
FEMA, CYBER, AGAIN — FEMA’s grant management system was at “increased risk of exploits” because it didn’t follow all DHS cybersecurity guidance, a watchdog report released Tuesday concluded. Although FEMA does follow most of that guidance, according to the Government Accountability Office, it didn’t initially have corrective action plans for 13 medium and low-risk vulnerabilities. After the GAO audit, FEMA did develop such plans. FEMA recently suffered a data breach that exposed millions of disaster victims’ sensitive information.
DOJ SEEKS CYBER MOOLA — The Justice Department needs more money to improve FBI cyber information sharing, FBI cyber tools and DOJ security monitoring, Attorney General William Barr told House appropriators in prepared testimony Tuesday. DOJ also wants money for the FBI to help fight counterintelligence threats from other nations and criminals who employ cyberattacks. ""These resources will allow the Department to combat these growing and serious threats by bolstering cyber investigative and collaborative capabilities and capacities,"" he said, adding that the department was requesting other funds to keep foreign spy agencies from accessing sensitive information on technology and to defend national assets against cyber threats.

"Trump says he's the mastermind of immigration policy, not Stephen Miller",www.politico.com,REBECCA MORIN,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/10/trump-stephen-miller-immigration-1266046,"President Donald Trump on Wednesday pushed back against the idea that senior aide Stephen Miller is the mastermind of the administration’s immigration policies following a purge of Department of Homeland Security officials. “Frankly, there’s only one person that is running it. You know who that is? It’s me,” Trump told reporters of his immigration agenda.
Story Continued Below
But the president also complimented Miller,saying he’s “a wonderful person” and “a brilliant man.”
“Stephen is an excellent guy,” Trump said. “People don’t know him. He has been with me from the beginning.”
Miller is reportedly aggressively pushing for a widespread DHS shakeup to help enact controversial new steps to curb illegal immigration.

Trump’s immigration plans face likely turbulence in courts By TED HESSON
So far, the White House has pushed out Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, Secret Service Director Randolph Alles and Homeland Security acting Deputy Secretary Claire Grady. He’s also yanked the nomination of Ron Vitiello to lead U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
Miller is reportedly looking to create tent cities along the border to house migrants and has pushed for an updated version of the family separation policy.
The president, however, claimed on Tuesday that the White House is not looking to reimpose the family separation policy, which was heavily criticized by Republicans and Democrats alike."
Trump: Likely Netanyahu reelection means 'better chance' of Middle East peace,www.politico.com,CAITLIN OPRYSKO,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/10/trump-netanyhu-reelection-israel-1265205,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter
President Donald Trump on Wednesday predicted that his administration’s goal of bringing peace to the Middle East has a better shot at success now that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is likely going to be reelected.
Speaking to reporters on the South Lawn of the White House, Trump congratulated one of his closest international allies on his likely victory in the tight race. Story Continued Below
“It may be a little early but I'm hearing he’s won it and won it in good fashion. So he has been a great ally. He is a friend. I would like to congratulate him,” he said, referring to the prime minister by his nickname. “That was a well fought-out race I can tell you. But it looks like Bibi has won that race.”
Trump, who welcomed Netanyahu to the White House shortly before Tuesday’s elections, cast the prime minister's win for a fifth term as a promising development for his administration’s plan to strike a peace deal between Israel and Palestine.

“The fact that Bibi won, I think we'll see some pretty good action in terms of peace,” he said. “Look, everyone said — and I never made it a promise — but everybody said you can't have peace in the Middle East with Israel and the Palestinians. I think we have a chance. I think we have now a better chance with Bibi having won.”
The administration has yet to release its blueprint for the deal that has eluded U.S. leaders for decades, but has said it would do so after Israel’s elections.
On Wednesday, national security adviser John Bolton suggested that the plan would be unveiled imminently now that Netanyahu is likely to remain in power.
“We’ve been in the preparatory stages to getting it ready. And I think we’re going to see that coming out in the very near future,” he told conservative talk show host Hugh Hewitt. Bibi’s reelection “opens all kinds of prospects,” he noted.
While Netanyahu's reelection signals consistency for the friendly relationship between the U.S. and Israel, the prime minister still faces the hurdle of potentially being indicted on corruption charges later this year, while Trump faces the looming prospect of being hammered by Democratic investigations into his presidency.
Despite Netanyahu’s legal troubles, the Associated Press reported that unofficial election returns indicate the prime minister and his party will have solid control over the country’s parliament.
But the elusive prospect for peace as envisioned by the White House, which has indicated support for a two-state solution between Israel and Palestine, stands to clash with Netanyahu’s election eve promise to annex parts of the Israeli occupied West Bank, long a contentious issue.
Later Wednesday, Trump posted a photo on Twitter that appeared to show supporters waving Trump campaign flags at an election night victory party for Netanyahu."
Trump calls Mueller probe an 'attempted coup',www.politico.com,REBECCA MORIN,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/10/trump-mueller-probe-attempted-coup-1264714,"President Donald Trump on Wednesday called special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation an ""attempted coup"" intended to remove him from office. ""It was an illegal investigation. It was started illegally. Everything about it was crooked,"" the president told reporters outside the White House before departing on a day trip to Texas. The president also claimed Mueller and his investigators, charged with probing allegations that the president's 2016 campaign colluded with the Russian government, ""were people that truly hated Donald Trump.""

""This was an attempted coup,"" he continued. ""This was an attempted takedown of a president, and we beat them.""
Trump has long derided Mueller's probe as a ""witch hunt"" and accused the former FBI director of building a team stacked with Democrats. Mueller, a registered Republican, submitted a report on his two-year long investigation last month.
Attorney General William Barr, in a summary of the report, wrote that Mueller didn't find a criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia to sway the 2016 presidential election. The attorney general also wrote that Mueller did not fully exonerate Trump in an obstruction of justice inquiry, but Barr added that he did not believe there was enough evidence to bring charges on the matter.

The president, responding to Barr's ostensible exoneration of the president, said Mueller acted honorably in conducting his investigation. Trump has since called for an investigation into how Mueller's probe began. The president previously said that he would like to see the full Mueller report released, but Trump has since backpedaled somewhat from that position.
Several members of Mueller's team, however, have disputed Barr's assessment of the investigation.
Democrats have urged Barr to release the more than 300-page report. Barr on Tuesday said a redacted report will be released within a week, an assurance that fell short of placating Democrats who want unfettered access to all of Mueller's findings as well as related information from a federal grand jury.
Trump said he has not seen or read the report.
""As far as I'm concerned, I don't care about the Mueller report,"" the president said."
De Blasio cites 'urgent steps' in declaring public health emergency for measles,www.politico.com,aeisenberg@politico.com (Amanda Eisenberg),04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/albany/story/2019/04/09/de-blasio-cites-urgent-steps-in-declaring-public-health-emergency-for-measles-959225,"“Children are in danger. We have to take this seriously,” de Blasio said at the Brooklyn library’s Williamsburg branch. “We’re taking urgent steps right now to make sure we can stop this.” | AP Photo De Blasio cites 'urgent steps' in declaring public health emergency for measles
Mayor Bill de Blasio declared a public health emergency in Williamsburg, the epicenter of the city’s worst measles outbreak in a generation, on Tuesday morning.
The emergency order mandates that both adults and children who may have been in contact with infected patients get the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine or face a $1,000 fine, according to the city. The city will be making unannounced visits to yeshivas and inspecting school records to determine which children have not been vaccinated, officials said.
The order also allows the city to issue violations and fines to yeshivas and day care centers that allow unvaccinated children on the premises, the mayor said.
“Children are in danger. We have to take this seriously,” de Blasio said at the Brooklyn library’s Williamsburg branch. “We’re taking urgent steps right now to make sure we can stop this.”
“Disease detectives” from the city health department will interview New Yorkers with measles symptoms and find out everyone they’ve been in contact with to make sure those people are vaccinated, de Blasio said.
The city is offering low- and no-cost vaccines, said Health Commissioner Oxiris Barbot, adding the city health department has doubled the estimated number of people in Williamsburg and Borough Park who need vaccinations. The declaration comes ahead of the Passover celebration where family celebrations heighten the risk of spreading the disease.
More than 280 people in New York City have contracted measles since October 2018 — the largest outbreak of the preventable disease since 1991. Most of the 285 cases occurred in Orthodox Jewish communities in Brooklyn.
Of the 285 cases, the vast majority are children under the age of 18. The disease can cause swelling of the brain and lungs, and children under the age of 5 can develop subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, a progressive neurological disorder, if they contract measles.
Twenty-one people have been hospitalized from the disease.
Some parents in the Orthodox Jewish community are rumored to be holding “measles parties” where they bring children together to contract the highly contagious disease, said Deputy Mayor Herminia Palacio.
“Exposing your unvaccinated child to measles is very dangerous, and it could be deadly,” Palacio said.
Barbot added that the best way to keep children safe is to get them vaccinated.
The city has sent out physical mailings and robocalls to 30,000 households in Yiddish to educate the community about vaccines, Barbot said. The city has also advertised in Yiddish newspapers, officials said.
“The point here is to make sure that we maximize the number of people who have accurate information,” Barbot said.
The city health department issued a directive in December for more than 250 yeshivas and day care centers to keep unvaccinated students out of class. Five yeshivas flouted that mandate, which led to more children contracting the preventable disease.
Now, those schools are subject to commissioner’s orders and on Monday, the city threatened to close yeshivas that ignore the directive — an unprecedented move by the health department.
“Schools that do not help us ... if they persist in allowing this danger to continue, we have the option to close them for a period of time,” de Blasio said.
It is the first time in recent history that the city declared a public health emergency around measles, Palacio said.
The city said it is confident that the executive order will not be challenged. Rockland County’s state of emergency was recently overturned by a judge.
Lawrence Gostin, director of the O’Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law at Georgetown University, agreed that the executive order is justifiable to quell the outbreak but that singling out zip codes might make the decision contentious.
“It was unwise of the Mayor to single out specific zip codes. This could be viewed as discriminatory, and opens the city up to the criticism that it is targeting specific religious groups,"" Gostin said in a written statement. “It could also create a backlash against vaccines by religious communities who could believe they are being victimized.”
Rockland County’s state of emergency, which Gostin said was “overly restrictive of individual liberty,” was recently overturned by a judge."
"Ocasio-Cortez's voters approve of her performance, if not her 'Democratic Socialist' label",www.politico.com,lnahmias@politico.com (Laura Nahmias),04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/albany/story/2019/04/09/ny-14-voters-like-ocasio-cortez-and-mostly-approve-of-her-policy-positions-even-if-they-dont-label-themselves-democratic-socialists-962114,"Ocasio-Cortez has described herself as a “Democratic Socialist,” but most of her constituents wouldn’t use that term to describe themselves, even if they agree with many of her policy ideas. | Mario Tama/Getty Images Ocasio-Cortez's voters approve of her performance, if not her 'Democratic Socialist' label
A majority of voters in Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez ’s district still like her, even if they don’t personally identify as Democratic socialists and wish Amazon hadn’t reneged on its deal to come to Queens, according to a new Siena poll released Wednesday.
The poll shows the 29-year-old freshman congresswoman, whose outspokenness and media savvy have catapulted her to stardom on the left and drawn scorn on the right, has a 52-33 percent favorability rating in the 14th Congressional district, several months into her term. She has already become well known, where only 15 percent of voters said they didn’t have an opinion about her. Sixty-five percent of voters said they’d been following the wall-to-wall coverage of their Congresswoman across multiple media platforms “very closely” or “somewhat closely.”
She has the highest net favorability rating out of a group of eight high-profile politicians, including New York’s Sens. Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , Gov. Andrew Cuomo, Mayor Bill de Blasio, President Donald Trump, and former Rep. Joe Crowley, whom she defeated in last year’s June Democratic primary elections.
Crowley represented the district for 20 years, but 38 percent of voters said they didn’t know enough to have an opinion of him.
Among Democrats, Ocasio-Cortez’s favorability is 65-22 percent. Her favorability is also higher among black and Latino constituents, 64 percent of whom approve of her. Just 45 percent of white voters said they had a favorable view of her, though. And she does better with younger voters than older ones. Her favorability rating among voters under 35 stands at 63-18, while voters over age 55 are split, 45-42 percent.
Ocasio-Cortez has described herself as a “Democratic Socialist,” but most of her constituents wouldn’t use that term to describe themselves, even if they agree with many of her policy ideas. Just 25 percent said they identified as “Democratic Socialist,” while 70 percent of voters said they’d call themselves something else.
But even if they disagree with the label, Ocasio-Cortez's constituents largely agree with her policy positions. Forty-three percent support taxing income above $10 million at a rate of 60 percent or more. Fifty-two percent are in favor of impeaching President Donald Trump. Seventy-five percent favor banning assault weapons. Seventy-three percent favor a federal guarantee of a job that pays a living wage, 76 percent favor free tuition at public universities and 75 percent favor Medicare for All.
The proposal she’s become most identified with — a plan to address climate change and create new jobs, called The Green New Deal — was less popular, with 41 percent in favor of it and 20 percent opposed. Thirty-eight percent said they didn’t know enough about it to have an opinion.
Voters also disagree with Ocasio-Cortez’s opposition to Amazon’s plans to build a huge new facility in Long Island City. Fifty-seven percent said they thought the company’s decision to pull out of the deal was “bad for New York” and 58 percent said they supported Gov. Andrew Cuomo and other elected officials’ attempts to woo the company back.
The poll, which sampled 607 registered district voters between March 31 and April 4 this year, has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.3 percent."
How Amy Astley learned to be a boss,www.politico.com,ZACK STANTON,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/10/amy-astley-architectural-digest-anna-wintour-1263654,"Subscribe to Women Rule on Apple Podcasts here . | Subscribe via Spotify here .
Amy Astley’s workday is a whirlwind. The editor-in-chief of Architectural Digest , her job is nonstop — business breakfasts, meetings with staff, an endless array of emails that she proudly responds to “until I pass out” at night.
It’s a pace that many would find daunting. But there’s a reason why Astley thinks it’s important: it shows her staff that she’s in the foxhole with them. And there’s an example Astley has in mind as she thinks about how to lead: Anna Wintour, the legendary Vogue editor who mentored her.
You hear the name “Anna Wintour,” and Astley knows what you imagine: Meryl Streep in “The Devil Wears Prada,” whose character is a relentlessly demanding boss. But in real life, Astley says it’s not quite that simple.
“They’re caricatures, they’re stereotypes,” Astley said in an interview for POLITICO’s Women Rule podcast . “This is a businessperson successfully running a business. It’s not easy. And some of those things that were heaped upon her, you don’t see it heaped upon men as much.”
Astley has led AD through something of a renaissance — dramatically expanding its digital business, launching new products and rejuvenating the century-old brand.
Working in the world of style and fashion journalism, Astley sees her role as reflecting on the culture and illuminating why certain things are important to society. And that makes politics an unavoidable topic — even if you’re not intentionally being political.
“I had Ricky Martin on the cover [of Architectural Digest] with his husband and his two kids … in their house in L.A.,” Astley said. “They were barefoot, casual. I didn’t really give it two thoughts because to me, they’re just a fabulous couple — beautiful family, great house. I had a lot of letters thanking me for just presenting them as a gay couple without putting any politics around it or pointing it out in any way, and it didn’t really occur to me that we would single them out in any way; to me, they were a family. That’s political.”
She came to the job after 13 years as Teen Vogue’s founding editor-in-chief — a position she was hand-picked for after a decade spent at its parent publication, Vogue. Astley credits her success at the top of the publishing world to the lessons she learned from Wintour’s example.
“She is a person who works all the time … and I have tried to bring that to all my jobs,” she said. “You see that she’s in it with you, working really, really hard. We all know of bosses who, like, don’t really come to work. And it’s not a positive.”
“I really learned watching her be relentless: Keep trying things; do new things,” Astley said. “Don’t worry if people say negative things about you. If something fails, carry on.”
For Astley, one of those “new things” was launching Teen Vogue in 2003 with a decidedly different perspective than other publications aimed at girls and young women.
“My thinking was feminist, to be honest. I wanted the magazine to be about the life and the well-being of the young woman,” she said. “It wasn’t about how to kiss or … silly quizzes or how to dress to attract boys. I didn’t want any of that. I didn’t want it to be about how you are in relation to men; how you attract them, how you make them happy, how you please them. [That’s] so dated, but that is still what teen magazines were largely doing at that point.”
Young women responded, and the magazine quickly became one of the most circulated in the publishing world and blazed a path for the rush of woman-positive media that followed — which Astley credits to the generation of people who followed her and “were able to deepen and continue that work.”
In that way, Astley herself became a model for young women pursuing leadership, much as Wintour was for her.
“I know what my staff thinks about me and they know what I think about them,” Astley said. “I think they’re the best, and I support them and I feel that comes back to me, and that’s why I’ve had a good career and have been able to make good products.”
“My team that I built, they know that I’m working hand-in-hand with them, and they know that I respect them and care about them. … It’s that simple. Respect, it all comes to respect.”

Barr: I think FBI spying on Trump campaign ‘did occur’,www.politico.com,ANDREW DESIDERIO,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/10/barr-fbi-spying-trump-campaign-1266531,"The nation’s top law enforcement official on Wednesday appeared to back up President Donald Trump’s assertion that the Justice Department “spied” on his presidential campaign — an explosive comment that heightened partisan tensions ahead of the release of special counsel Robert Mueller’s report. During his second day of Capitol Hill testimony this week, Attorney General William Barr also suggested that the Justice Department was gearing up to investigate the genesis of the counterintelligence probe into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election — a key rallying cry for Trump and his congressional allies that comes amid the president’s consistent claims that the Mueller report exonerates him.
Story Continued Below
“Spying on a political campaign is a big deal,” Barr told members of a Senate Appropriations subcommittee during a hearing about the Justice Department’s budget. “I think spying did occur. The question is whether it was adequately predicated. And I’m not suggesting that it wasn’t adequately predicated. But I need to explore that.”
Barr’s statements are certain to please Trump, who said earlier Wednesday that the FBI’s decision to launch such an investigation amounted to an “attempted coup.” The president has long decried the counterintelligence probe as a “witch hunt” that was launched by officials who were biased against him, citing the approval of a surveillance warrant for Carter Page, a former foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign.
Congressional Democrats blasted Barr’s claim and accused him of spreading a debunked plot.
“Barr knows how counterintel investigations work. He knows there was ample evidence of Russian attempts to infiltrate the Trump campaign and that the FBI took lawful action to stop it,” Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, tweeted. “Giving a wink and a nod to this long-debunked ‘spying’ conspiracy theory is irresponsible.”
There is no evidence that officials were “spying” on the president’s campaign, and the warrant was approved after Page had left the campaign. The Justice Department’s inspector general is already investigating whether the warrant process was abused. Barr previously said that probe was slated to wrap up in May or June.

“I have no specific evidence that I would cite right now,” Barr later said. “I do have questions about it.”
When pressed by Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) about his use of the word “spying,” Barr clarified: “I want to make sure there was no unauthorized surveillance.”
“I am not saying that improper surveillance occurred. I am saying I am concerned about it and looking into it,” Barr added. “I believe there is a basis for my concern. But I’m not going to discuss the basis.”
The attorney general said he has not yet set up a team to investigate the origins of the probe. While Barr said he would not launch an investigation into the FBI over the alleged spying, he said it was likely that there was a “failure among a group of leaders there at the upper echelon.”
“I do not view it as a problem that is endemic to the FBI,” Barr said.
Democrats said Barr’s comments suggested he was trying to do Trump’s bidding.
“It’s very concerning when the top law enforcement officer in the country uses incendiary language like that. That’s the kind of thing you hear the president say at his rallies, when he’s advocating a deep-state coup attempt. It ought to concern all of us,” House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) told Politico.
“He was unclear in his remarks,” Schiff added. “But all Americans should be concerned if this represents what we urge new democracies not to do and that is when you win, investigate or persecute your political rivals.”
House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) said Barr’s remarks “directly contradict what DOJ previously told us,” adding that he has asked the Justice Department for an immediate briefing.
Barr’s Senate testimony was his second Capitol Hill appearance in as many days, as the attorney general prepares to release a redacted version of Mueller’s highly anticipated report within the next week.
Barr infuriated lawmakers on Tuesday when he said he would not turn over the report to Congress, defying Democrats’ demands to see not only Mueller’s full report but also the underlying evidence. The attorney general also said he would not seek a court order to release top-secret grand jury information, and that Congress has no inherent authority to view grand jury information.
On Wednesday, Barr promised again to work with Nadler and Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) if they seek to view some of the redacted portions of the report. But he said grand jury information is the “most inflexible” category for a speedy release.
“I am willing to work with the Judiciary committees to see if there is a workaround that could address any concerns or needs that they have,” Barr said.
Congress
Barr: Mueller turned down offer to review Russia probe findings By KYLE CHENEY and ANDREW DESIDERIO
Barr told senators that one of his four categories for redactions — to protect the reputations and privacy of “peripheral third parties” — would not apply to the president, who has changed his tune in recent days about his desire to see the full report made public.
“No,” Barr said when Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) asked whether he would redact damaging information about the president. Barr said those redactions apply only to “people in private life, not public officeholders.”
In his four-page summary, Barr wrote that Mueller could not establish that the Trump campaign conspired with the Russian government to influence the outcome of the 2016 election. Barr also noted that Mueller uncovered evidence of obstruction of justice on the part of the president, but he dismissed the possibility of filing charges, saying it wasn’t clear that Trump’s “intent” was to obstruct the investigation.
Barr told Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) that he had a conversation with Mueller about why he did not reach a conclusion on the obstruction question. When asked if Mueller sought to leave it to Congress to decide whether Trump obstructed justice, Barr said: “He didn’t say that to me.” When asked whether Mueller believed the decision should be up to the attorney general, Barr said: “He didn’t say that either. But that’s generally how the Department of Justice works.”
Barr declined to go into further detail, citing the imminent release of the redacted report. But he later said Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein — who helped Barr prepare the four-page memo — agreed with his conclusion on obstruction. Barr said he did not know whether Mueller himself backed that conclusion.
Nadler said Tuesday he would hold off on issuing a subpoena for the full report and the underlying evidence, but that he expects to issue one “in short order.” The committee voted last week to give Nadler the authority to subpoena the report.

Paul to Pompeo: You do not have ‘permission’ for war with Iran,www.politico.com,NAHAL TOOSI,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/10/pompeo-rand-paul-iran-war-1266526,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter
Sen. Rand Paul on Wednesday warned the Trump administration not to go to war with Iran, at least not without getting permission from Congress.
The libertarian-leaning Kentucky Republican spoke directly to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo during a hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Story Continued Below
He asked Pompeo if the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force, which allowed for U.S. troops to fight entities responsible for the 9/11 attacks and associated forces, included Iran.
Pompeo declined to directly answer the question, saying he’d defer to lawyers, but stated that there is “no doubt there’s a connection” between the Iranian government and al-Qaeda, the terrorist group behind the 2001 attacks.
“You do not have the permission of Congress to go to war with Iran,” Paul responded, while chiding Pompeo for trying to deflect the question. “Only Congress can declare war.”
Pompeo was testifying before the Republican-controlled committee, a session that came the same week President Donald Trump designated Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps a terrorist organization, prompting concerns about future clashes between the U.S. and Iranian-backed forces.

The hearing was supposed to focus on the Trump administration’s proposal to slash the State Department budget by about a fourth. But lawmakers from both parties have dismissed the Trump administration’s budget proposal, saying it was a non-starter the way past such Trump plans have been.
Instead they zoomed in on other subjects, from the administration’s strategy in Afghanistan to its struggles to convince North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons.
Pressed by Sen. Ben Cardin of Maryland on whether the North Koreans have taken meaningful steps to share details of their nuclear program, Pompeo instead tried to switch the topic to Iran, alleging that what the Iranians had shared as part of the Iran nuclear deal was “a total fraud.” The Trump administration has pulled out of that nuclear deal.
Cardin noted he was talking about North Korea, not Iran, then asked if international inspectors were on the ground in North Korea examining its nuclear program, the way they were in Iran. Pompeo said they were not.
Senators on both sides of the aisle expressed concern about China’s rising global influence and the potential harm it could cause to U.S. interests.
Pompeo agreed with their assessments of the threat and insisted that the Trump administration is keen on countering China’s activities in cyberspace and beyond.
One especially testy moment came when Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, a Democrat from New Hampshire who is the only woman on the committee, pressed Pompeo on whether the U.S. would insist that Afghan women be given a significant role in ongoing peace talks with the Taliban.
Pompeo wouldn’t commit to such action, but he stressed that the welfare of Afghan women was a priority, especially given the Taliban’s brutal treatment of women when they ran Afghanistan.
Shaheen appeared frustrated with Pompeo’s answer. “This is half the population of the country,” she said.
“I hope they will make their voices heard,” he said.
The secretary of state was similarly unwilling to be pinned down on another sensitive subject: the Israeli-Palestinian crisis."

 Organized labor will slow-walk its 2020 endorsements.
— Former McDonald's chief raps McDonald's for pledge to no longer lobby against minimum wage hikes.
GOOD MORNING! It’s Wednesday, April 10, ANOTHER SHOE DROPS AT DHS: Claire Grady, acting deputy secretary at the Homeland Security Department, resigned effective today, departing DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen tweeted early Tuesday evening. For those keeping score, this is the fourth DHS departure in five days, following Monday's removal of Secret Service Director Randolph ""Tex"" Alles; Nielsen's own announced resignation Sunday; and the White House's withdrawal Friday of Ron Vitiello to be director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
Still awaiting removal, according to administration officials, are USCIS director Lee Francis Cissna and DHS General Counsel John Mitnik. White House senior adviser Stephen Miller, a hard-line immigration restrictionist, is driving the shakeup, which President Donald Trump doesn't wish to hear described as a housecleaning. ""I never said I was cleaning house,"" the president said Tuesday. ""I don't know who came up with that expression. We have a lot of great people over there.""
Grady's departure is the consequence of a federal statute that requires Grady, as acting deputy, to replace temporarily the departing Nielsen; since President Donald Trump has already designated Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan to be acting secretary, Grady had to be made unavailable.

LABOR SLOW-WALKS 2020: As Democratic presidential contenders line up today to address a D.C. gathering of North America's Building Trades Unions, labor leaders are reluctant at this early stage to choose among them, POLITICO's Ian Kullgren and Natasha Korecki report. “Everybody’s kind of taking a step back,” said Steve Rosenthal, a former political director for the AFL-CIO who's advising unions on 2020 campaigns. “I don't see ... any movement toward any type of major endorsements.”
More than a dozen national unions endorsed Hillary Clinton in 2015, including the American Federation of Teachers and the SEIU. That prompted criticism from the rank and file as Bernie Sanders' presidential bid gained momentum. Then, of course, Clinton lost in November, at least partly because she scored the narrowest majority of union households seen by any Democratic presidential candidate since Walter Mondale in 1984. Now organized labor says it won't make that mistake again. ""There’s no process in place. We’re not making any endorsements,” said Sean McGarvey, president of the North America’s Building Trades Unions. “We don’t see ourselves making any endorsements any time early … if at all.” More here .
DEMS INTRODUCE HARASSMENT BILL: In the first presidential election of the #MeToo era, Democratic presidential candidates lined up Tuesday behind a broad proposal to strengthen protections against workplace harassment, POLITICO’s Alice Miranda Ollstein reports. The legislation, introduced Tuesday by Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), would eliminate the tipped minimum wage, bar mandatory arbitration and pre-employment non-disclosure agreements, and extend civil rights protections for LGBT workers. The bill would also extend federal protections against harassment to independent contractors and interns.
Sens. Amy Klobuchar , Kamala Harris , Cory Booker , Kirsten Gillibrand , Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren all signed on to the bill, which for some of them cuts close to the bone. Sanders , Harris , Gillibrand , and Klobuchar have all been accused of presiding over, tolerating, or contributing to various types of hostile work environments. “They know they are under the microscope when it comes to sexual harassment,” Ollstein writes, “Their campaigns have implemented mandatory trainings, set up anonymous hotlines for staff to report misconduct, and rigorously screened new hires for any history of past accusations.” More here .
KENNEDY BILL BARS NDAS IN HARASSMENT SETTLEMENTS: Republican Sen. John Kennedy is preparing to introduce legislation to disallow non-disclosure agreements in sexual harassment settlements if the alleged perpetrator is a public official or a public employee, POLITICO’s Marianne LeVine reports .
AT THE BORDER WH TO APPEAL 'REMAIN IN MEXICO' LOSS: The White House said in a statement Tuesday that it will appeal a Monday court ruling halting ’s ""remain in Mexico"" policy on the grounds that the ""cooperative program"" was ""extensively negotiated with the government of Mexico."" (Mexico has insisted it was a unilateral move by the U.S.) A San Francisco-based judge issued a preliminary injunction Monday against the administration's policy of forcing certain non-Mexican asylum seekers to wait in Mexico during their court proceedings. ""This action gravely undermines the President’s ability to address the crisis at the border with the tools Congress has authorized and disrupts the conduct of our foreign affairs,"" the statement from the White House said.

Wages BANK OF AMERICA HIKES MINIMUM TO $20: Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan announced Tuesday that the bank will increase its hourly minimum wage to $20 over the next two years, POLITICO’s Victoria Guida reports. “If you get a job at Bank of America, you’ll make $41,000,"" Moynihan said on MSNBC, up from a current hourly minimum of about $16. In response, SEIU President Mary Kay Henry said in a written statement: “Bank of America is racing to raise wages for their lowest-paid employees thanks to the brave workers in the Fight for $15 and a union movement whose strikes, protests, and organizing on the job have made $15 and a union a demand that cannot be ignored.""
The announcement came one day before Moynihan was set to appear before the House Financial Services Committee, where Democratic lawmakers are expected to excoriate corporate leaders for not passing tax-cut savings on to their employees. “From last summer to this summer, Bank of America will buy back more than $20 billion of its own stock,” Guida notes.

FORMER MCDONALD’S CEO RAPS WAGE MOVE: Ed Rensi, who was chief executive and president of McDonald’s Corp. in the 1990s, doesn't approve of the fast-food chain’s March pledge not to lobby against minimum-wage hikes. “McDonald's pursued a path of political correctness,"" Rensi wrote Tuesday in Forbes, ""leaving policymakers, state restaurant associations, and franchisees unsure where it stands on radical wage proposals"" and “providing a public relations coup for its detractors at the Service Employees International Union.” POLITICO’s Rebecca Rainey broke the news in March that McDonald's was halting its lobby efforts on minimum wage at all levels of government.
McDonald's' declaration, Rensi wrote, blindsided McDonald’s franchisees who were already “seeing their equity dwindle and margins squeezed.” Rensi's most interesting point: ""The corporation benefits when mandates force its franchisees to charge higher prices,"" because McDonald's Corp. ""receives a portion of all sales as a percentage of rent and franchise fees."" Read Rensi's piece here .
ON THE HILL AWKWARD AT APPROPRIATIONS: The House Homeland Security appropriations panel postponed indefinitely a hearing scheduled for today with Acting ICE Director Ronald Vitiello, following the White House's decision Friday to withdraw Vitiello’s nomination to lead the agency on a permanent basis. Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard (D-Calif.), who chairs the subcommittee, said in a written statement: “It is unfortunate that the president is impulsively robbing the department of so much of its leadership at a time when it is more important than ever for Congress to hold the department accountable for its actions.”
Inside the Agencies ROBOTS AT WALMART: In an effort to keep up with Amazon, mega-retailer Walmart is adding more machines and robots to its stores to take over tasks such as cleaning and sorting products that come off trucks, Sarah Nassauer and Chip Cutter report for the Wall Street Journal. This year the company plans to add “autonomous floor scrubbers” in 1,500 of its 4,600 stores, and machines that scan shelves in at least 300. “The company said the addition of a single machine can cut a few hours a day of work previously done by a human, or allow Walmart to allocate fewer people to complete a task,” they write.

NOMINATIONS CONFIRMATION CORNER:
Wage and Hour: The Senate late Tuesday afternoon voted to limit debate and invoke cloture on the nomination of Cheryl Stanton for Wage and Hour administrator, teeing up a Senate vote today.
PBGC: The Senate HELP Committee confirmed Gordon Hartogensis Tuesday to lead the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. Hartogensis (whose brother-in-law is Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell) was cleared by the Senate Finance Committee late last month. His nomination now heads to the Senate floor.

IT’S WEDNESDAY, APRIL 10. WELCOME TO MORNING EDUCATION. Got news to share? Drop me a line at khefling@politico.com .
Driving the Day DEVOS TO FACE HOUSE DEMOCRATS TODAY: Expect fireworks when the Education secretary appears for the first time before the House Education and Labor Committee since Democrats gained control of the chamber this year. She returns to Capitol Hill about two weeks after generating a stir at separate appearances before House and Senate Appropriations subcommittees — particularly over the Trump administration's budget proposal that sought to cut $17.6 million from a Special Olympics education program.
— During the hearing, Chairman Bobby Scott (D-Va.) is expected to challenge DeVos for what he sees as the department's ""lack of transparency"" in answering questions on a host of K-12 and higher education matters — including the department's position pertaining to using federal funds to arm teachers.
— ""In August 2018, we asked the Department to clarify its position on the use of taxpayer money to arm teachers, which has left a dangerous opening for school districts to use federal education funding to put firearms in classrooms. We have not received a substantive explanation of its position,"" Scott is expected to say, according to his prepared remarks.
— The hearing starts at 9 a.m. in 2175 Rayburn. Watch the livestream .
— Also on the Hill today: The Senate HELP Committee will meet to discuss strengthening accountability as it seeks to reauthorize the Higher Education Act. The hearing starts at 10 a.m. in 430 Dirksen. Watch the livestream .
— Meanwhile, all morning in the Rayburn foyer, the Institute for Higher Education Policy and other groups are hosting an “interactive learning experience” designed to showcase the barriers former prisoners face when they re-enter society. The event comes one day after bipartisan legislation was announced that would end a ban on Pell Grants for incarcerated students. Read more from Benjamin Wermund.

HIGHER EDUCATION TRUMP ADMINISTRATION TAKES NEW APPROACH ON AFFIRMATIVE ACTION: The Education Department has long targeted affirmative action in the college admissions process, but now it’s taken it one more step. Texas Tech University's medical school has agreed to stop considering race in admissions as part of an agreement with the department.
— It marks the first time the Trump administration has reached a resolution in a probe of the use of race in admissions. The move could foretell how the Education Department will proceed with ongoing investigations into affirmative action policies at Harvard and Yale. Read more from Ben.
RESHUFFLING THE FEDERAL STUDENT AID OFFICE: The Trump administration is planning a major reorganization of the Education Department’s Office of Federal Student Aid. The department will significantly reduce number of senior officials who serve on the FSA executive committee and who report directly to the head of the office, according to a plan presented during a staff meeting on Tuesday and reviewed by POLITICO.
— Senior officials began developing the Federal Student Aid reorganization last October , and DeVos signed off on the plan last week, according to the presentation slides.
— Under the plan, fewer senior officials will report directly to Mark Brown, the new chief operating officer whom DeVos appointed last month. The 18-member executive committee of senior leaders will be reduced to eight members, including Brown, to make it “a smaller, decision-focused body,” according to the presentation slides.
— The executive committee will consist of four new deputy chief operating officers: A. Wayne Johnson, deputy for strategy, innovation, and transformation; Michael Dean, deputy for strategic measures and outcomes; Robin Minor, deputy for partner participation and oversight; and Chris Greene, deputy for customer experience. It will also include senior advisers John Kane and Julian Schmoke Jr. as well as a spot for a new chief of staff. Michael Stratford has more .
K-12 SPOTLIGHT ON ESSA: The National Urban League is calling on Congress today to hold hearings focused on the Every Student Succeeds Act. Resource equity, states’ efforts to amend their previously submitted ESSA plans, data transparency and accessibility, and the federal role in oversight are all areas the group says are ripe for discussion.
— The call for hearings comes as the Urban League releases an equity report card that looks at how well states are addressing issues such as supports for struggling schools in their state plans. The results will be discussed during a noon event today at the National Press Club.
— Separately, the Education Department has put Arizona on “high-risk status” over testing. The department is raising red flags concerning the state's efforts to roll out alternative K-12 assessments that go beyond its AzMERIT standardized test — raising the possibility the state could lose more than $300 million in Title I funds if it doesn't comply.

TEACHER UNREST HEATS UP IN OREGON: Teachers in the state have organized several #redfored activities today focused on K-12 funding. It will lead up to a “day of action” on May 8 that’s expected to draw teachers out of their schools to protest. The Statesman Journal reports the teachers are demanding an additional $2 billion per biennium to maintain and improve K-12 schools.
ICYMI: KELEHER DEFENDS JOB AS PUERTO RICO’S EDUCATION SECRETARY: Julia Keleher, whose turbulent tenure as Puerto Rico's Education secretary ended last week, tells POLITICO she has no regrets about how she handled her role. Keleher oversaw the closure of hundreds of schools after Puerto Rico lost about 40,000 students in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria in 2017. Beyond the mass closings, she clashed with the teachers union in her successful drive to bring charter schools and a voucher program to the island.
— ""I stood up for children who didn't have a voice to advocate for themselves in an environment where probably three generations have been underserved by the public education system,"" Keleher said. Read more from your host.

QUICK FIX Story Continued Below
— A timely announcement by DOT that it will hand out $1.36 billion in Capital Investment Grants could help Elaine Chao have a smoother House appearance today.
— Senate leaders are hoping to have a surface transportation reauthorization bill out of committee before the August recess.
— House Democrats say the Trump administration’s proposed cuts to TSA and the Coast Guard would leave the country vulnerable to security threats.
IT’S WEDNESDAY:
""The sun shines / And people forget / The spray flies as the speedboat glides / And people forget.""
Transit CIG FOR YOU AND ME: FTA announced Tuesday that it is handing out $1.36 billion in Capital Investment Grants funding, including $225 million to five new bus rapid transit projects. The five new projects included are in Jacksonville, Reno, Albany, Portland and Spokane. As our Tanya Snyder reports , lawmakers have pressured the agency to release CIG funds faster, and Chao is (or was) likely to face questions about the pace when she testifies about the administration's fiscal 2020 budget request on Capitol Hill today. If last month’s Senate Appropriations hearing is anything to go by, this week’s appearance in front of the House’s spending committee could also be consumed by questions about the FAA’s certification and grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX.
Infrastructure THE ON RAMP: Senate committee leaders have their sights set on an ambitious timeline for the surface transportation reauthorization, which is due by next September, Tanya reports . Environment and Public Works Chairman John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) is hoping to pass a bill through the committee before the August recess, and ranking member Tom Carper (D-Del.) is on board. ""In the past we've sometimes waited till too late,"" Carper said. ""I'd rather be too early than too late."" It remains to be seen how that approach will mesh with that taken by the House, where Democrats are planning to advance a broader infrastructure bill later this year. Barrasso said that should be phase two, after passing the reauthorization (phase one).
PELOSI'S READY: Speaking before a building trades union's national legislative conference Tuesday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Democrats are ready to ""get to work, advancing an historic, at least $1 trillion plan"" on infrastructure. She also gave a nod to rhetorical jockeying over the Green New Deal, saying ""I think we should have a green ideal. Take the best of what we all have to offer to build the infrastructure in a green way to preserve our planet, that creates jobs.""

Security DEAD ON ARRIVAL: House Democrats said Tuesday they will fight the administration’s proposed budget cuts to TSA and the Coast Guard, saying the reductions would jeopardize the country’s security, our Stephanie Beasley writes . Rep. Lou Correa (D-Calif.) said at a House Homeland Security Committee hearing that TSA would “struggle” under the cuts and they would leave America vulnerable to attacks.
Hurry it up: Lawmakers also pressed TSA to speed up its deployment of computed tomography scanners in airports. Rep. John Katko (R-N.Y.) called the current rate is “completely unacceptable.” Agency chief David Pekoske said he expects 75 new scanners this year and 225 more in 2020.
Aviation AIRLINES FRET OVER PROLONGED BOEING GROUNDING: United Airlines is having to use larger airplanes on routes usually flown by the grounded Boeing 737 MAX, costing the carrier money in the short-term, President Scott Kirby said in a letter to employees Tuesday. “Of course, we can’t keep this up forever,” Kirby said, according to Reuters . The CEO of Delta Air Lines, which doesn’t fly the MAX, is worrying about long-term effects, too. “I hope it doesn’t set us back as an industry,” Ed Bastian said Tuesday at an event covered by the Atlanta Journal Constitution. While Bastian said he's ""confident” Boeing will solve its problems, he noted the two recent crashes will “open up a lot of questions” about the relationship between FAA regulators and the industry.
AROUND THE WORLD: Here are the countries whose aviation safety agencies will take part in a joint review of the 737 MAX, as our Brianna Gurciullo confirmed with the FAA Tuesday: Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Ethiopia, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency, Indonesia, Singapore and the United Arab Emirates. The review will be headed by former NTSB Chairman Christopher Hart.
WRITE IN: Drone giant DJI is urging professional operators in the U.S. to submit comments to the FAA on its proposed new rules for drones to fly at night and over people. Fewer than 100 people have commented on that rulemaking, and the feedback period ends next week. “Given how vital these rules are for every professional drone pilot in America, it is surprising to see how few comments have been received,” DJI Vice President Brendan Schulman said.
Safety DRUG-ADDLED: Lawmakers peppered witnesses at Tuesday’s House Transportation Committee hearing on highway safety with questions about drugged driving. “Everybody, I think, intuitively knows that marijuana influence does slow down your thinking ability and your ability to process more than one thing at a time,” said Rep. Doug LaMalfa (R-Calif.). “We got to do a lot more on the marijuana situation.” Rep. John Garamendi (D-Calif.) noted that while about 30 percent of traffic fatalities are associated with impaired driving, DUI arrests have gone down. Whether it’s an enforcement problem or an education problem, Garamendi mused, “that probably means money.”
Here’s how you can spend that money: NTSB board member (and former Democratic House Transportation Committee staffer) Jennifer Homendy testified that “the difficulty with drugs is that there’s no impairment standard,” and NTSB has recommended that DOT work with HHS to develop one. “In the meantime, we’ve recommended that NHTSA issue guidance to states that tells law enforcement officers when to test, what drugs to test for, how to test and cutoff levels to help determine impairment,” Homendy said. She gave a shoutout to NHTSA’s advanced classroom and field trainings for law enforcement officers that go beyond the basic field sobriety testing to teach officers to identify and detect impairment.
What Americans think: The hearing came the same day as a survey commissioned by the National Safety Council found that Americans strongly support safety measures including lowering local speed limits, mandating alcohol ignition locks and instituting motorcycle helmet laws.
Get out of your car: The hearing also focused heavily on bicycle and pedestrian safety. Highways and Transit Subcommittee Chairwoman Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.) said bicycle and pedestrian safety was a personal priority that she wants to see reflected in the next surface transportation bill. “All of these modes of transportation must be treated equally, not cars over scooters, not bicycles over walking,"" she said.
Lobby Watch A couple of hires to keep your eye on: Hyperloop America hired First Rule, a firm started by former Monsanto executive Travis Brown, to “educate policy makers on Hyperloop technology, advocate for innovative transportation financing models, and advocate for clear regulatory guidance on Hyperloop technology,” according to a disclosure form. And the Association of American Railroads brought on Susan Andres of The Cactus Group to lobby on freight railroad issues.

— Democrat Dan McCready raised $1.6 million for the redo election in NC-09 while Republicans are still split in a crowded primary.
— Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) raised $1.4 million in the first quarter while the major pro-Senate Democratic super PAC went up with an early radio buy in the state.

THE TOPLINES BATTLEGROUND TEXAS — Look no further than Texas for the next frontier of the House battleground map. The DCCC announced Tuesday it would open a headquarters in Austin to focus on six battleground seats it hopes to flip, with the effort led by Southern Regional Political Director Michael Beckendorf and state senior adviser Roger Garza.
Texas was more competitive than many expected in 2018. Three races saw over $32 million combined in outside spending: TX-07 , TX-23 and TX-32 (Democrats won in TX-07 and TX-32, while GOP Rep. Will Hurd hung on by the narrowest of margins in TX-23). But there were five districts the GOP won by a margin of five points or less that saw practically no investment from outside groups: TX-10 , TX-21 , TX-22 , TX-24 and TX-31 . They saw a combined outside spend of just over $2.7 million — with the lion’s share coming in TX-21, helping to muscle now-GOP Rep. Chip Roy out of a competitive, open-seat primary and through the general election. With its new headquarters, the DCCC is signaling that the six close districts it didn’t flip will be central to its offensive strategy to hold the House in 2020. Additionally, three other Republican-held districts — TX-02, TX-06 and TX-25 — were decided by a single-digit margin.
Of course, Republicans aren’t going to roll over in the Lone Star State. Freshmen Reps. Colin Allred and Lizzie Fletcher are both on the NRCC’s target list, and Hurd remains a top Democratic target. Plus, the other races won’t be as under the radar this cycle. “We’ll make sure their candidates don’t get by unscathed” in the districts that saw close races, a NRCC official told Score, who was granted anonymity to speak about internal planning. The official said the committee will spend to “define” Democratic challengers in districts that were largely ignored by both party committees last cycle.
 After a rough 2016, union leaders are holding back . “Even as Democratic contenders are well into the process of courting high-ranking and local labor officials, union leaders plan to delay their endorsements as they take the temperature of members on the ground in an attempt to avoid the top-down approach that caused so much heartburn” in 2016, POLITICO’s Ian Kullgren and Natasha Korecki reported .
— Many of the Democratic presidential hopefuls in the Senate are signing on to a bill to tackle a problem that’s plagued some of their own operations: workplace harassment, POLITICO’s Alice Miranda Ollstein reported.
— Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) pledged to release his tax returns by Monday (which is Tax Day), per The New York Times’ Sheryl Gay Stolberg .
— Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) got her time in the CNN town hall spotlight.
NC-09, FOREVER — McCready is raking in the dough ahead of the redo election. His campaign said he raised $1.6 million in the first quarter and has $1.46 million in cash on hand, per Campaign Pro’s Laura Barrón-López .
— Meanwhile, Republican state Sen. Dan Bishop released a TV ad featuring McCready next to a bunch of prominent Democrats (Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is in the foreground, with Speaker Nancy Pelosi blurry in the background) as Bishop calls them “clowns.” The campaign said it is a six-figure buy. The Charlotte Observer’s Jim Morrill notes this is the first TV ad from a Republican ahead of the May 14 primary, while several other candidates told him they're focusing on mailers.
THE GRANITE STATE — Shaheen raised $1.4 million in the first quarter and has $1.5 million cash on hand, WMUR’s John DiStaso reported. Her campaign told WMUR that it was the best off-year Q1 haul for any New Hampshire candidate, ever.
— Senate Majority PAC is running a new radio ad in New Hampshire boosting Shaheen. In the ad , the narrator blasts “out of state billionaires” for running attacks against Shaheen and praises her record on health care, prescription drugs and the opioid crisis, Campaign Pro’s James Arkin reported. SMP is spending $200,000 on the radio spot, a surprisingly large number to spend on a radio ad this early in a state that’s not expected to be a battleground. Advertising Analytics tracked the buy as starting on Tuesday and running through early June.
— New Hampshire Republicans are waiting for Gov. Chris Sununu to decide what he’s going to run for. “A half-dozen GOP operatives familiar with Sununu’s political quandary … cautioned against reading too much into the governor keeping his options open,” National Journal’s Madelaine Pisani reported.
HOUSE RECRUITMENT WATCH — Republican Chele Farley, who unsuccessfully challenged Gillibrand in 2018, launched a bid to run against Democratic Rep. Sean Maloney in NY-18, per POLITICO New York’s Laura Nahmias .
— Lancaster City Council Member Angela Underwood-Jacobs, a Republican, said she’ll run to challenge Democratic Rep. Katie Hill in CA-25, per Roll Call’s Bridget Bowman .
ECHO CHAMBER — Twitter is not real life, and that’s especially true for those talking about the Democratic primary. “The outspoken group of Democratic-leaning voters on social media is outnumbered, roughly 2 to 1, by the more moderate, more diverse and less educated group of Democrats who typically don’t post political content online, according to data from the Hidden Tribes Project ,” The New York Times’ Nate Cohn and Kevin Quealy wrote.
POLLS POLLS POLLS — The top two Democratic statewide officials in Virginia have low approval ratings in a new poll from The Wason Center at Christopher Newport University. Just 40 percent approve of Gov. Ralph Northam, with 49 percent disapproving. Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax has 31 percent approving of his job, while 35 percent disapprove. Of note: The poll was taken before CBS aired interviews with the women who accused Fairfax of sexual assault. (1,067 registered voters, March 11-31). In a generic ballot for the upcoming General Assembly elections, 43 percent say they’d vote for a Democrat, and 39 percent say they’d vote for a Republican (854 likely voters).
— Ocasio-Cortez may be the foil for Republicans nationally, but she’s popular at home. A new Siena poll found that voters in her district approve of her, 52 percent to 33 percent, POLITICO New York’s Laura Nahmias reported.
PRIMARY PROBLEMS — Democratic Rep. Kurt Schrader in OR-05 is getting a primary challenger from Milwaukie Mayor Mark Gamba. Gamba “was elected to the Milwaukie City Council in 2012 and has been mayor of the 21,000-population city on the southern border of Portland since 2015,” per OPB’s Jeff Mapes .
THE CASH DASH — Louisiana Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards announced he raised $2.55 million in the first quarter of 2019. He has $10.19 million cash on hand. Republican Eddie Rispone’s campaign told LaPolitics he has $10.4 million in his war chest and put in “seven figures” of his own money.
— Freshman Democratic Rep. Sharice Davids (KS-03) raised $450,000 in the first quarter, per her campaign.
VOTING SECURITY — The launch of the California Department of Motor Vehicles’ automated voter registration program was marred by an apparent hacking attempt, rushed deadlines and more, the Los Angeles Times’ John Myers reported.
— Aki Peritz, a former CIA counterterrorism analyst, was able to obtain personal information about 40 states’ governors through online voter registration systems (and detailed his findings in The Washington Post ).

Disaster aid talks break down as new storm nears,www.politico.com,politico.com,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-agriculture/2019/04/10/disaster-aid-talks-break-down-as-new-storm-nears-577842,"With help from Catherine Boudreau, Liz Crampton and Oma Seddiq Disaster aid negotiations have collapsed in Congress, as another potential “bomb cyclone” storm is bearing down on the Midwest and the Plains. Producers affected by wildfires, hurricanes and flooding dating back to last year are likely to be left waiting for extra aid until after lawmakers return from a two-week recess.
— Environmental groups and individual farms today are asking Congress to focus on specific food and ag policies as lawmakers debate climate change legislation. Major food manufacturers also laid out their own climate policy priorities.
— Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue told House lawmakers he wants to work with Congress on disaster aid to develop a fix for Midwestern growers whose stored grain was swamped by floodwaters last month but wasn’t insured. Perdue also defended the use of Roundup and said the definition of “able-bodied” as applied to food stamp recipients could benefit from “fine-tuning.”
HAPPY WEDNESDAY, APRIL 10! we can’t believe more dockless scooters are coming to D.C. DISASTER AID TALKS BREAK DOWN AS NEW STORM NEARS: With both chambers of Congress racing toward recess at the end of this week, Senate negotiations over a disaster relief package have collapsed, POLITICO’s Caitlin Emma and Marianne LeVine report . That means storm-struck communities from the Midwest to Puerto Rico will continue waiting for additional federal aid until at least the end of April.
The latest delay comes as another major storm threatens to cause further damage to farms, businesses and infrastructure in the Plains and Midwest, just a few weeks after the region was pummeled by a “bomb cyclone” that triggered massive flooding.
Forecast: The storm is projected to “rapidly strengthen across the nation’s heartland around Wednesday and Thursday,” bringing heavy winds, rain and snow, per AccuWeather. The National Weather Service is warning of a “potentially historic storm.”
On the Hill: Perdue said Tuesday that USDA can provide technical assistance to Congress on appropriations language that would enable farmers to access federal aid for crops that were in storage but weren’t covered against flood damage by current safety net programs, our Liz Crampton reports .
“We would love to be involved in helping the language as the disaster bill moves along, to be sure they get the flexibility,” Perdue said during a House Appropriations subcommittee hearing.
Democrats and Republicans are both proposing to assist Midwestern states affected by the recent catastrophic flooding, but broader talks have been bogged down over financial relief for Puerto Rico. House Democrats on Tuesday unveiled a new $17.2 billion measure, HR 2157 (116) , that includes $3 billion for farm-belt flood relief, Caitlin reports .
The Midwest doesn’t need billions in disaster aid like farmers in Southern states do, House Agriculture Chairman Collin Peterson (D-Minn.) told reporters on Tuesday. The majority of crops or livestock damaged by flooding in Nebraska and Iowa were covered by crop insurance or are eligible for farm bill disaster programs, which isn’t the case for many Southern crops like pecan trees and peaches hit by last year’s hurricanes, Peterson said.
“People are saying we have to get billions of dollars to the Midwest. Well, that’s a bunch of baloney,” he said. “The only thing that is not covered [in the Midwest] is this stored grain that was damaged. I think this is something we should look at, and do a one-time thing to help.”
FOOD, AG IN THE CLIMATE DEBATE SPOTLIGHT: More than 300 environmental groups, farms and other organizations today will send a letter to lawmakers asking them to “advance a Green New Deal that reflects the central role of food and agriculture in our climate crisis and its solutions,” referring to the non-binding progressive proposal to shift the U.S. economy away from fossil fuels within a decade.
MA got an early look at the letter , which represents the latest call to focus on changing food and farm policies through a federal effort to curb climate change.
The coalition calls for legislation to restrict methane emissions from concentrated animal feeding operations; reduce consumption of “industrially produced animal products” and promote plant-based foods; combat ag consolidation; and other policies likely to draw pushback from the industry.
FOUR TOP FOOD COMPANIES DEBUT CLIMATE PRINCIPLES: Mars, Danone, Nestlé and Unilever — which together formed the Sustainable Food Policy Alliance — unveiled climate policy principles today that will inform their advocacy on Capitol Hill.
The two-page document endorsed a carbon pricing system that would set prices transparently. There also should be incentives for the agriculture and forestry sectors to reduce and sequester greenhouse gas emissions that are combined with technical assistance for adopting certain practices, the alliance said.
Several other principles touch on accelerating innovation in renewable energy, investing in infrastructure that’s more resilient to the impacts of global warming, and ensuring vulnerable communities have the resources to take on the costs of any regulatory changes.
PERDUE: ‘ABLE-BODIED’ DEFINITION MAY NEED REFINING: During the same appropriations hearing, the secretary defended USDA’s proposed rule tightening work requirement waivers for some food stamp recipients, and suggested the definition of able-bodied adults without dependents — the population the rule would apply to — might need to be further refined.
“The definition describing able bodied may need some fine-tuning,” Perdue told the panel amid a back-and-forth with Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.) about whether people deemed disabled or physically unfit for work considered able-bodied under Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program rules (they are not).
“Certainly we’re talking about people who are able to work,” Perdue added. “I think when you hear the term able-bodied, it’s people who are able to work from ages 18 to 49, not senior citizens, not parents with dependents, not pregnant women. Able-bodied adults without dependents.”
House Agriculture Democrats, including nutrition panel leader Marcia Fudge (D-Ohio), have requested USDA provide lawmakers with demographic information on the population of able-bodied adults without dependents who would be affected by the rule.
“There’s probably a legal definition I’m just not aware of, of able-bodied,” Perdue told reporters after the hearing. “But that was a fine point that probably needs to be discussed further and communicated and convinced in that way.”
ROUNDUP’S DEMISE WOULD BE ‘DEVASTATING,’ PERDUE SAYS: The USDA chief told House appropriators that Roundup has “exponentially” increased agricultural productivity in the last 25 years, along with other crop protection chemicals, and he thinks it would damage the ag industry if the herbicide was pulled from the market, Liz writes .
The glyphosate-based weedkiller developed by Monsanto (now owned by Bayer) was the subject of two recent court cases resulting in multimillion-dollar verdicts against the agribusiness, and thousands more federal and state cases are lined up.

Lighthizer’s USMCA grind continues,www.politico.com,politico.com,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-trade/2019/04/10/lighthizers-usmca-grind-continues-423294,"With help from Sabrina Rodriguez, Megan Cassella, Doug Palmer, Alex Panetta and Jesse Chase-Lubitz
QUICK FIX Story Continued Below
— U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer dined with Blue Dog Democrats this week in a bid to get support for USMCA. Meanwhile, House Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal sends the first of a series of letters on Democrats’ demands for the pact.
— The U.S. scored a win with Peru, using provisions in a trade deal to get Lima to back off a move that would have arguably reduced the effectiveness of a forestry watchdog agency. The win could bolster efforts to placate Democrats’ concerns over USMCA enforcement.
— Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will target China’s close ties to South America during a trip to the region, where he will urge countries to embrace fair trade and market access with transparency and strong legal frameworks.
IT'S WEDNESDAY, APRIL 10! took a look in the mirror before marking his birthday today and can report that the past two years of trade coverage hasn’t caused too many gray hairs. Got any tips to gift me today? Let me know: abehsudi@politico.com or @abehsudi
Driving the Day LIGHTHIZER’S USMCA GRIND CONTINUES: Lighthizer dined with the Blue Dog Coalition on Monday evening as part of his drive to court moderate Democrats for the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement. Neal also attended, according to multiple congressional aides.
The meeting, which focused partly on USMCA, comes after Lighthizer met with House Democratic freshmen last week and with members of the New Democrat Coalition, another group of centrist Democrats that’s considered a source of votes for the new deal. Lighthizer also discussed the deal with the entire Democratic caucus last month at the invitation of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi .
Neal puts it in writing: The Ways and Means chairman sent a letter to Lighthizer on Tuesday outlining Democrats’ concerns over whether the new deal’s labor and environmental standards are strong and enforceable. Neal said he and other panel Democrats will detail other concerns in letters “in the next days.” Sabrina has more here .
Trumka talks USMCA: Pelosi’s next guest on USMCA at her regular “speaker’s meeting” this morning will be AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka. The labor group has said it would reject the deal in its current form but is actively working with the administration to try to address its concerns. Trumka has been skeptical that the White House can get an acceptable deal passed in Congress by the summer. Labor groups and Democrats are also waiting for Mexico to pass laws that would fully implement its labor commitments under the deal.
The view up north: Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland reiterated on Tuesday that Ottawa sympathized with Democrats’ concerns but said Canada is staying out of a domestic ratification debate. She also told reporters she’s met regularly with Democratic lawmakers but said Canada was not interested in reopening the deal. “Canada has done its part,” she said.
Freeland also said Canada is in no hurry to ratify USMCA, indicating that Ottawa is no longer fazed by President Donald Trump’s threat to withdraw from NAFTA. She said the country was more pressed to ratify the deal with the European Union and Asia-Pacific countries to enjoy new benefits.
USTR PROVES ITSELF WITH PERU: Peru backtracked on plans to move an independent forestry agency under the purview of the environment ministry — an action the U.S. said would have violated the terms of their free trade agreement. The administration had threatened to move toward potential tariff retaliation if Lima didn’t change course. The trade pact required Peru to establish the forestry watchdog agency as an “independent and separate agency” to better combat illegal logging.
Congressional Democrats believe the forestry annex in the Peru trade deal is a model for improving USMCA to better enforce labor rights in Mexico. A proposal from Senate Democrats would emulate inspection and verification provisions in the Peru deal. Read the story here .
REFRESHING THE RETALIATION: Freeland confirmed that Canada is looking at reconfiguring its retaliatory tariffs in response to U.S. steel and aluminum penalties in order “to have the greatest possible impact in the United States.” Freeland also repeated Canada’s demand for the tariffs to be removed entirely.
Perdue continues advocacy effort: Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue, who has had a front-row seat to the impact of the retaliation on farmers, told reporters Tuesday that he continues to be an “advocate” of resolving the steel and aluminum tariffs with Canada and Mexico. The U.S. wants Canada and Mexico to accept quotas, although talks on that issue haven’t made much progress. Perdue said he “would hope to persuade President Trump that quotas may work in lieu of tariffs.”
TRUMP’S NEW TARIFF THREAT: The U.S. could be entitled to retaliate against the EU with tariffs that could hit $11 billion worth of European imports in its dispute over Airbus. Pro’s DataPoint team breaks it down here . Want to add DataPoint to your Pro account? Learn more.
TRUMP’S ‘$4.5 BILLION GIFT’ TO THE U.S. STEEL INDUSTRY: Trump’s decision to impose Section 232 tariffs on steel imports last year helped boost the domestic industry’s net income by 116 percent, a steel market analyst said Tuesday at the Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries Inc.’s annual meeting in Los Angeles. “So what the gave to the steel industry was a gift of $4.5 billion,” said Markus Moll, managing director of the analytical firm SMR GmbH.
The windfall allowed the companies to spend about $1 billion on new equipment. “There are steel mills being built,” Moll noted. “This means the plan worked. What the government intended to do, it actually delivered, at least to some extent.” But surprisingly, the market value of the companies’ shares dropped by 30 percent, which indicates the financial community has doubts about the long-term sustainability of the industry, Moll added.
ROSS HEADING TO MEXICO: Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross will be in Mexico later this week to meet with Mexican Economy Secretary Graciela Márquez and other officials as well as attend the U.S.-Mexico CEO Dialogue. Ross and Márquez will also speak on a panel at the two-day event, which begins Thursday.
FROM ZERO TO HERO AT THE WTO: The U.S. practice of “zeroing” when calculating anti-dumping duties finally got a win at the World Trade Organization in a panel report Tuesday. Canada challenged the use of the controversial methodology in a case against U.S. tariffs against imports of softwood lumber. The WTO panel faulted the U.S. for how it determined instances of so-called targeted dumping by Canadian lumber producers but upheld the U.S. use of zeroing despite the method being struck down by the WTO’s Appellate Body. Canada said it is considering an appeal of the ruling. Read the full story here .
POMPEO TARGETS CHINA IN SOUTH AMERICA: Pompeo will take aim at China’s close trading ties with South American countries during a trip to Chile, Paraguay, Peru and Colombia from April 11 to 14, a senior State Department official said Tuesday.
The secretary of State will continue to emphasize the ’s economic vision for the region that centers around fair trading and market access with transparency and strong legal frameworks, the official said in a call with reporters. “We well know that China doesn’t always follow these principles,” the official added.
“On this, we make the same arguments in the Americas that we make all around the world: Economic engagement in China should meet the same high standards — in terms of transparency, adherence to anti-corruption standards, … debt sustainability, labor rights and environmental best practices — that we’d expect of any other fair competitor in the world’s markets,” the official said.
Looking to APEC: Pompeo will also meet with Chilean President Sebastián Piñera to discuss the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit Chile is hosting this year, the official added. APEC leaders are scheduled to meet in November, and APEC trade ministers will meet in May.
CUTLER URGES NEW U.S. APPROACH TO CONFRONTING CHINA: Raising tariffs on Chinese goods has brought Beijing to the negotiating table, former U.S. trade official Wendy Cutler acknowledged in a new paper in her role as vice president of the Asia Society Policy Institute. But now it’s time for the United States to shift from its “go it alone” approach to working with other countries that share its concerns because that’s more likely to achieve more meaningful and longer lasting reforms, Cutler argued.
The should use upcoming meetings of the G-20, APEC and other international forums to retool its strategy and regain the trust of key trading partners, Cutler said. The White House should remove steel and aluminum tariffs and refrain from imposing new 232 tariffs on autos to gain support for its China trade and investment agenda, Cutler said.

Budget TWO-YEAR DEAL: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi have agreed to begin negotiating a two-year budget deal that would raise caps on defense and non-defense spending, POLITICO’s Jennifer Scholtes reports .
The agreement came as House Democrats pulled a bill that would have raised defense spending caps to $733 billion in fiscal 2020 and $749 billion the following year, writes POLITICO’s Sarah Ferris, Heather Caygle and John Bresnahan.
Democrats had planned to let the House vote on the measure this week, but it was facing too much opposition from progressives and moderates.
ACQUISITION CHANGES: Rep. Mac Thornberry (R-Texas) says he plans to unveil two acquisition reform bills before the House Armed Services Committee begins hashing out the defense policy bill, our own Connor O’Brien reports .
The first would carry out previous changes and the second would focus on spurring innovation in small and medium-sized companies.
Thornberry also said he hopes the Defense Department won’t lose its ability to move money among different accounts, a possible consequence of Trump’s decision to shift $1 billion in funding toward wall construction on the southern border, O’Brien reports.
GET READY FOR NDAA: Senate Armed Services, meanwhile, released its schedule for marking up its version of the defense policy bill. Action begins the week of May 20, per O’Brien.
The subcommittee markup schedule is here and the full committee markup schedule is here . Aside from the Personnel Subcommittee, all other sessions will be closed.
HOMELAND SECURITY WALL CONTRACTS: The Pentagon announced Tuesday night it had awarded two contracts totaling $976 million for border wall construction, making good on Trump’s pledge to divert funds without asking Congress. SLSCO of Galveston, Texas, received $789 million for “border replacement wall construction” in New Mexico. Barnard Construction of Bozeman, Mont., received $187 million for “primary pedestrian wall replacement” in Yuma, Ariz.
Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) said Trump “just robbed” military personnel to pay for his “vanity wall.”
“This move lays bare the fallacies of [this] administration’s unbelievable argument that the wall is about protecting American communities by securing the border. It isn’t. It’s about the President’s ego and his nationalistic agenda,” Blumenthal said in a statement. “His reckless, self-centered demagoguery is endangering our security and creating a true national emergency.”
NELLER’S VIEW: Marine Commandant Gen. Robert Neller told senators on Tuesday that a memo he wrote that was later leaked to the press had been taken out of context, and that border deployments were not harming readiness, O’Brien writes .
And predicts that U.S. troops’ role on the border will expand as the situation there deteriorates, per Defense News.

— Fraught free speech: A Senate Judiciary panel led by Ted Cruz will devote a hearing to allegations that online platforms repress conservative content.
— Broadband mapping latest: Senate Commerce puts a spotlight on broadband data gathering, particularly in rural communities that lack decent internet connectivity.
— Welcome, Vera Jourová: During her visit to Washington, the EU Commissioner for Justice will focus on tech regulation (or a lack thereof).
GREETINGS AND WELCOME TO MORNING TECH . It’s me again, your new host and neighbor, Alexandra Levine. Since I last landed in your inbox, I’ve decided that D.C. is the most acronym-packed city I’ve ever lived in, but I’m proud to report I’m learning my letters reasonably well. . And
Have an event for MT’s tech calendar? Email us the details at SENATE PANEL DELVES INTO TECH BIAS ALLEGATIONS — Today Cruz’s Judiciary subcommittee on the constitution will dive deep into allegations that online platforms “censor” conservative content — a charge tech companies flatly deny. Both Cruz (R-Texas) and Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), a new addition to the panel after shifting from the House, have long accused online platforms of bias and are expected to lead the charge on the topic today. It’s a sign the Senate is taking up the tech “censorship” mantle embraced last year by the then-Republican House.
— Not all conservatives are happy with the theme. Billy Easley, a senior tech policy analyst for the Koch-backed Americans for Prosperity, is warning the committee against infringing on free speech. “Senator Cruz is right: tech companies ought to provide an open platform for speech across the political and ideological spectrum,” he said in a statement. “But asking the government to police online speech — either through direct action or by cajoling private firms — sets a dangerous precedent.” Carl Szabo, vice president for right-leaning trade group Net Choice, called it “inconsistent for conservatives to support the free speech rights of businesses” while opposing it for “private platforms when moderating content they host.”
— What to watch for: While we’ll be monitoring for exchanges between lawmakers and the two tech representatives slated to testify — Twitter’s Carlos Monje and Facebook’s Neil Potts — other key witnesses include film director Chuck Konzelman and Robbie Parker, the father of a Sandy Hook school shooting victim. Konzelman’s anti-abortion movie “Unplanned” has become a flashpoint for allegations of an anti-GOP tech bias ( more on that here ), and Parker is one of a number of family members who filed a defamation suit against Infowars founder Alex Jones for spreading hoaxes about Sandy Hook.
— Who you won't see: Google, which planned to send manager of external outreach Max Pappas, a former Cruz aide, is not slated to participate, the committee said. A source familiar with talks said the committee spurned Google's offer to send Pappas, as first reported by Axios. A Cruz spokesperson did not offer comment. The incident is reminiscent of a similar flap from last year, where the Senate Intelligence Committee declined Google's offer to send an executive below the CEO level to testify on foreign meddling on social media.
THE STATE OF OUR MAPS — Senate Commerce holds a hearing this morning on the steps needed to improve the accuracy of broadband mapping data, particularly in rural communities where the lack of reliable information has become a source of frustration for lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. Panel Chairman Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) has criticized the FCC’s handling of the issue and, six months ago , contemplated the use of a congressional spending bill to force the commission to revisit the problem. “Flawed and inaccurate maps ultimately waste resources and stifle opportunities for economic development in our rural and underserved communities,” Wicker said in an opening statement shared with MT.
— Witnesses include USTelecom President Jonathan Spalter, who is leading his own mapping initiative . ( Charter Communications and Microsoft both outlined their own concerns with the mapping process and suggestions for improvement in blog posts this past week.)
JOUROVÁ'S IN WASHINGTON TO TALK TECH — EU Commissioner for Justice Vera Jourová is on this side of the pond this week for meetings and other events centered on how regulators can confront the downsides of tech, from privacy risks to the spread of misinformation online to election interference. On Thursday, Jourová will give a speech at Brookings on how well Europe and the U.S. are cooperating on that front. Remember: She's been critical of her American counterparts on that score in the past — once telling MT, for example, that the FTC here needed to ""hurry up"" its Cambridge Analytica-sparked investigation into Facebook. And that was eight months ago.
— No doubt the status of that Facebook inquiry will come up during Jourová’s planned sit-down with FTC Chairman Joe Simons, per a trip agenda shared by the EU delegation to the U.S. She's also slated to meet with Attorney General William Barr, as well as a trio of lawmakers with prime roles in the debate over federal privacy regulation in the States: Wicker, Commerce Consumer Protection Subcommittee ranking member Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), and Banking Committee Chairman Mike Crapo (R-Idaho).
ALL ABOARD THE NET NEUTRALITY TRAIN? — House lawmakers on Tuesday moved to successfully hitch a bevy of amendments to the Save the Internet Act, H.R. 1644 (116) , ahead of its expected passage today. They agreed by voice votes to attach the two GOP amendments: one requiring a Government Accountability Office study on all companies’ role in the internet ecosystem and another requiring the FCC to provide a list of what common-carrier regulations the commission would not apply to broadband (the Obama-era FCC declined to specify that last part).
— Republicans didn’t fight initial Democratic amendments to add language compelling a GAO study on net neutrality’s effects on minorities and underserved groups and provisions mandating FCC reporting on broadband mapping. Lawmakers will continue debating amendments and vote on the bill’s final passage today.
— Reality check: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) deemed the bill, which lacks much GOP support, “dead on arrival” in the Senate, as John reported Tuesday .
BLACKBURN’S BACK WITH BROWSER — Blackburn is today planning to introduce a Senate version of her privacy legislation known as the BROWSER Act, which she originally offered in 2017 as a House member, a Republican aide confirmed to John. The measure embodies many of the data privacy issues now on the table, such as putting the FTC in charge of privacy, the need for opt-in consent for collecting sensitive information and federal pre-emption of state law.
AND FINALLY, A ROUND OF APPLAUSE — Congratulations to this year’s Congressional Innovation Fellows, selected by TechCongress to serve as policy advisors to lawmakers across the Hill on tech issues including national security, cybersecurity, election security, AI and facial recognition.

—Sen. Bernie Sanders is releasing a new version of “Medicare for All” legislation this morning.
—The top three insulin makers and pharmacy benefit managers step into the hot seat today at a congressional oversight hearing on the rising costs of the diabetes treatment.
—Medicare's innovation center is planning a primary care announcement later this month.
Welcome to Wednesday PULSE , where your author is reminding everyone that congressional spring break (err, recess) is just around the corner. Dan Diamond will be back at the helm tomorrow. Greet him with tips at ddiamond@politico.com .
Driving the Day SANDERS TO UNVEIL ‘MEDICARE FOR ALL’ BILL – Sen. Bernie Sanders will unveil a revamped version of his Medicare for All legislation this morning, switching the Washington health care conversation back to the progressive plan dividing Democrats – and away from President Donald Trump's efforts to tear down Obamacare.
The Sanders bill will largely be similar to the version he introduced in September 2017. And it again comes with the support of several high-profile colleagues, who are now also running for president.
What's changed: The bill will now include coverage for long-term care services, bringing it in line with the House version, H.R. 1384 (116) , introduced in February. The bill has lost one co-sponsor since 2017 who's still in the Senate: Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, who said she's backing more incremental plans to expand coverage.
What hasn’t changed: Four candidates for the Democratic nomination are again expected to co-sponsor the bill – Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand , Elizabeth Warren , Cory Booker and Kamala Harris .
IN CONGRESS TODAY: THE INSULIN PRICE SHOWDOWN – The three top insulin makers and the three largest pharmacy benefit managers testify about the diabetes medicine’s soaring cost in front of the House Energy and Commerce’s oversight subcommittee this morning. While there have been a slew of drug pricing hearings this year, this will be the first to jointly call up pharmaceutical companies (Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk and Sanofi) and the middlemen (CVS, Express Scripts and OptumRx). That sets up a brawl about insulin’s steadily climbing list prices (700 percent over 20 years) and the heavy rebates that drugmakers argue are driving the trend.
The three major PBMs on Tuesday were at the Senate Finance Committee, where senators grilled them — along with relatively smaller PBMs, Humana and Prime Therapeutics — on rebates and whether the middlemen benefit from higher prices. PBMs denied that they discouraged slashing prices, and some pledged to get on board with legislation to provide their rebate data to congressional advisers. More for Pros .
Meanwhile both sides scale up insulin access efforts. Sanofi announced it would expand a savings program allowing patients with high out-of-pocket costs to pay $99 per month for 10 boxes of insulin pens, or 10mL vials, dropping down from $149 for a box of pens in the same program last year. Sanofi’s plan comes one week after Cigna announced a deal with all three drugmakers to cap monthly insulin costs for its commercially insured consumers at $25.
Inside the Agencies BRAIN DRAIN IN CMS’ MEDICAID DIVISION – Two career staffers are leaving the CMS office overseeing Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program, the latest in a string of departures at the agency, POLITICO’s Rachana Pradhan scoops. Including the latest exits, at least five people have decided to leave the Center for Medicaid and CHIP Services since the start of the year.
Who’s out this time: Michael Nardone, who joined CMS in early 2016 and ran the Medicaid division's Disabled and Elderly Health Programs Group, is retiring from the agency this month. Jim Golden, who reports to Nardone and is responsible for policy implementation and oversight of Medicaid managed care companies, is also leaving. More for Pros.
PRIMARY CARE ANNOUNCEMENT COMING APRIL 22 – The CMS Innovation Center director, along with HHS Secretary Alex Azar and CMS Administrator Seema Verma, invited stakeholders to an “exciting discussion on primary care delivery, including care for the complex, chronically ill” at the American Medical Association’s office, according to an invite CMMI Director Adam Boehler sent stakeholders and obtained by your author. A CMS spokesperson confirmed that an event is scheduled for April 22 , and it will be open to the press, though the spokesperson didn't confirm the event's contents.
Provider groups have been anticipating a primary care announcement for months . It's been known that CMMI has been working on a new track to an existing primary care model, as well as developing a project to test direct contracting. POLITICO recently asked Boehler if the two concepts would be merged into one model or separated. He responded that they're different, but, “the way we thought about them together is when we do talk about these, I want to make sure we announce a broad spectrum. If you just look at one thing, then someone may not know the other options.”
IN THE COURTS COURT GRANTS WISCONSIN’S REQUEST TO DROP OUT OF TEXAS V. AZAR – Wisconsin’s request to be dropped from the federal lawsuit seeking to strike down all of Obamacare has been granted by a federal appellate court. Wisconsin was a co-leader on the lawsuit when the state's previous Republican attorney general filed it with 19 other GOP-led states last year. The state's withdrawal won't have a practical impact on the lawsuit going forward .
FEDS CHARGE 24 IN TELEMEDICINE FRAUD SCHEME – A series of payments were allegedly made to physicians and telemedicine companies to get them to prescribe medically unnecessary back, shoulder, wrist and knee braces, according to a DOJ announcement. Medicare was reportedly billed $1.7 billion, of which $900 million was paid out in one of the largest fraud schemes HHS and the FBI have investigated together. More for Pros.

EYE ON PHARMA FDA announces new opioid label requirements. The changes are intended to help health care providers safely decrease the dose in patients who are physically dependent on pain medications. They were spurred by reports of serious harm, including withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, psychological distress and suicide in opioid-dependent patients who abruptly had their medicines discontinued or the doses rapidly decreased, the agency said. More for Pros.
Indivior indicted over opioid treatment – A federal grand jury indicted the drugmaker Tuesday in a nationwide scheme to allegedly boost prescriptions for Suboxone Film used to treat opioid addiction. The company is accused of increasing prescriptions by deceiving health care providers and benefit programs into believing the medication is “safer” and “less susceptible to diversion and abuse” than other similar medications, according to the indictment.
The company said the indictment was ""wholly unsupported by either the facts or the law.""
AROUND THE NATION IDAHO LIMITS VOTER-BACKED EXPANSION – Idaho Gov. Brad Little signed legislation to add work requirements to the Medicaid expansion voters approved in November. The state follows Nebraska and Utah, which also placed limits on an expansion approved by a ballot initiative.
But Little, a Republican, noted his concerns about the idea, citing “costly lawsuits” over similar work requirements that were recently struck down in Arkansas and Kentucky. More for Pros .
TEXAS SENATE PASSES BILL TO MOVE SMOKING AGE TO 21 – A bill ( TX SB21 (19R) ) prohibiting sales of tobacco products and e-cigarettes to people under the age of 21 got preliminary approval from the Republican-led chamber on Tuesday after a short debate. Senators attached an amendment that would exempt active duty military personnel from the ban. Similar legislation ( TX HB749 (19R) ) unanimously passed a House committee last month. If it passes, Texas would join a handful of states – mostly blue ones – raising the tobacco age to 21.

HITAC meeting today,www.politico.com,politico.com,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-ehealth/2019/04/10/hitac-meeting-today-423363," Mohana Ravindranath ( @ravindranize
We’ve got a buzzy meeting today and more important business developments. Here’s what you need to know:
— HITAC meeting today: The Health Information Technology Advisory Committee will be chewing on the big interoperability rules today. We’ve got a preview and will be updating you about new developments.
— Cerner gets new pressure: The Kansas City EHR developer will be getting new business pressure as the company has a deal with a group of activist shareholders to increase profitability.
— Feds bust fraudulent telemedicine scheme: : DOJ announced a huge bust against 24 individuals – including many executives at a telemedicine company – who the feds say were involved in a huge Medicare fraud scheme.
But first, the jump.
eHealth tweet of the day: David Bates @DBatesSafety “Absurd Epic moment of the day: a refill to approve for diabetes test strips. ‘Route’ was required. 235 options not including ‘none!’ Shouldn’t the system know what routes are ok for test strips (surely intra-articular not a good idea)?!?”
WEDNESDAY: Your correspondent’s softball season is starting up again this year — let’s all hope for winning and no injuries! Talk batting tips at dtahir@politico.com . Discuss no injuries @Morning_eHealth .
Driving the Day HITAC MEETING TODAY — The big interoperability rules are at the top of the agenda in today’s Health Information Technology Advisory Committee meeting. Here are some of the interesting points from the preview materials posted Tuesday night:
— Info blocking committee report: The information blocking task force will be making some draft recommendations today on the info-blocking portions of the rule — maybe the most contentious part of the Trump administration's proposal. A lot of the recommendations dwell on technical and logistical points — for example, that the timelines to update contracts might be too tight — but some points are more philosophical. In the latter category, for instance, the task force argues that more and more developers will choose not to certify as health IT — which might make information blocking rules somewhat weak going forward. The full presentation here .
— Also on the agenda: Pediatric certification recommendations: The “Health IT for the Care Continuum” task force is issuing recommendations on pediatric certifications, a requirement of the 21st Century Cures Act. The recommendations are envisioned as ways to certify products as being particularly useful for pediatrics providers; they include a requirement for transitioning control and access for data for pediatric patients, as a given child will grow up and may eventually want to block parental access. Full presentation here .
HEALTH IT BUSINESS WATCH CERNER GETS NEW PRESSURE — The Kansas City-based EHR vendor got some new business pressure Tuesday as it agreed with activist investors Starboard Value to install four new members on its board of directors and hit certain operating margin targets.
Wall Street was broadly happy with the announcement, as the company's stock price jumped just more than 10 percent. The good vibes weren't universal, though. Investment bank Evercore's analysts said the company's 2020 target “looks aggressive.”
Such investments can be a prelude to a broader shakeup. The health IT sector’s most famous example is athenahealth, when activist investors Elliott Management took a 10 percent stake in May 2017 and later precipitated a chain of events resulting in the sale of the firm. Starboard owns a much smaller stake than Elliott did: only 1.2 percent.
Inside the Agencies FEDS BUST MASSIVE TELEMEDICINE SCHEME — Twenty-four people — including executives at telemedicine companies, doctors and the owners of durable medical equipment — have been charged for their participation in a massive Medicare fraud scheme, the Justice Department announced Tuesday. It’s one of the largest fraud schemes HHS’ Inspector General’s Office and the FBI have investigated, according to news release.
Some defendants allegedly ran an international call center that advertised to Medicare beneficiaries. The center bribed telemedicine companies, who in turn bribed their doctors to prescribe medically unnecessary back, shoulder, wrist and knee braces. They made those prescriptions often without any patient interaction at all. The defendants billed CMS for $1.7 billion, about $900 million of which was paid out. Pros can read the rest of the story here .
— In other telemedicine news: Researchers found virtual consultations lead to increased antibiotic prescription for children, according to a study published in Pediatrics this week. The study found that pediatric patients with respiratory infections were prescribed antibiotics more frequently when consulting with a clinician through a direct-to-consumer-telemedicine platform, compared to in-person primary care or urgent care visits. The study is a first step toward understanding how pediatric patients are affected by telemedicine, lead researcher Kristin Ray said in an interview. Pros can read the rest of the story here .
CMS PROPOSES EXPANDING BLOOD PRESSURE TRACKING COVERAGE — CMS on Tuesday proposed expanding coverage for blood pressure monitors that track patients outside the doctors’ office. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring is currently only covered for patients whose anxiety about being in the doctor’s office might drive up their blood pressure, but that leaves out potential hypertension patients whose blood pressure might be lower in the doctor’s office as compared to other settings, according to CMS. The proposal would expand coverage to that group. CMS is currently seeking public comment on the proposal.
— Shakeup at CMS Medicaid office: Two top career staffers at CMS’s Medicaid and Children’s Health Insurance Program office are departing, the latest chapter in a string of exits there, our colleague Rachana Pradhan reports.
Michael Nardone, who joined CMS in early 2016 and ran the Medicaid division's Disabled and Elderly Health Programs Group, is retiring from the agency this month, three sources said. He's among five people who announced their departures from the office since the year began, Rachana reports.
TURMOIL IN WHITE HOUSE IT OFFICE — The White House office responsible for coordinating IT initiatives across the government — from cybersecurity to the cloud – is suffering from turmoil, including burnout, departures, and dismal morale, our Cybersecurity colleague Eric Geller reports .
The Office of the Federal Chief Information Officer is tasked with coordinating the government’s $105 billion in IT and cybersecurity spending, but only 19 percent of the office’s 30 employees expressed satisfaction with their workplace in February, down from a hardly sterling 50 percent in October. That’s despite a November reorganization and new leadership. Pros can get the rest here .

The message to the White House: Don’t send him up because we may not confirm him.
The message MM gets from the White House: The vetting process on Cain is only getting started. And it could take a couple of months. One official suggested the idea that Trump may get Steve Moore but not Cain is certainly possible. But added that “people say a lot of things.” Right now there is pretty much a constituency of one for Cain: Trump. The most likely outcome is he never gets nominated. But nothing is certain.
Bankers in the dock — It will feel like 2009 all over again when CEOs of seven of the largest banks face off against fired up House Democrats on the Financial Services Committee at 9:00 a.m. this morning. Only this time, there are no bailouts to bash bankers about and no devastating financial crisis seizing the globe.
Still, CEOs from JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Bank of America, State Street, Citigroup and Bank of New York Mellon will face hot fire over the rise in leveraged lending, relaxed regulations by the Fed and the size of share buybacks and dividends in the wake of President Trump’s tax cuts. Hearing memo is here .
2020 DEMOCRATS EYE BANKS — Our Zachary Warmbrodt and Victoria Guida report here that big banks will be a top target of 2020 Democratic presidential contenders.
GOOD WEDNESDAY MORNING — Happy bash a banker day! Zachary Warmbrodt on federal regulators rebuke of Wells Fargo’s response to its record of customer abuses. House Financial Services bankers hearing begins at 9:00 a.m. … Senate Finance has a hearing at 10:15 a.m. on “The 2019 Tax Filing Season and the 21st Century IRS"" … Consumer Prices at 8:30 a.m. expected to rise 0.3 percent headline and 0.2 percent core … FOMC Minutes at 2:00 p.m. should give insight into the decision to drop both expected 2019 rate hikes …
MORE ON MOORE — NY Mag’s Jonathan Chait: “A little over two and a half years ago, Stephen Moore appeared at a conservative panel on the election and the economy, where one questioner asked about monetary policy. ‘Well, you know, I’m not an expert on monetary policy,’ admitted Moore, before proceeding to deliver an answer bearing out this very confession.” Read more .

Allied Progress has a new digital ad up today ahead of the hearing entitled “Not Just Wells Fargo. They are also launching a new sight called Big Bank Facts .
Greg Baer, President and CEO or the Bank Policy Institute to MM on the hearing: “Wednesday’s hearing will likely highlight the fact that the rhetoric about banks hasn’t caught up to the reality that today banks are stronger and safer and an essential driver of America’s economic success.” Read more .
HITTING BACK AT BETTER MARKETS — The Financial Services Forum has its own report out responding to the Better Markets report scooped in MM on Tuesday.
Per Forum President and CEO Kevin Fromer: “In an attempt to politicize a serious hearing and discussion about the United States’ robust financial system, this report offers nothing more than a gross mischaracterization of the response to the global financial crisis.”
RELY ON JAMIE — Bloomberg’s Robert Schmidt and Austin Weinstein: “There’s a joke going around Washington about the best strategy for the Wall Street CEOs when they face off with lawmakers this week: stay calm and let Jamie Dimon take over.” Read more.
O/H at a dinner MM attended last night : “Why won’t Jamie just run? He could be a unifier. He’s a leader, he’s kind of exactly what we need right now.” Which is a cue for emails to MM saying: “Are you kidding me?” Yes, I’m thinking of you, Dennis.
MARKETS STOCKS CLOSE LOWER — AP’s Alex Veiga: “Industrial companies led a broad slide in stocks on Wall Street Tuesday, ending the benchmark S&P 500′s eight-day winning streak. The sell-off came as traders weighed growing trade tensions between the U.S. and the European Union, and a report forecasting dimmer global economic growth this year”
IMF LOWERS GROWTH OUTLOOK — Bloomberg’s Andrew Mayeda: “The International Monetary Fund cut its outlook for global growth to the lowest since the financial crisis amid a bleaker outlook in most major advanced economies and signs that higher tariffs are weighing on trade. The world economy will grow 3.3 percent this year, down from the 3.5 percent the IMF had forecast for 2019 in January” Read more .
FLY AROUND CONGRESS EYES DEAL TO AVOID CUTS — Our Jennifer Scholtes and Caitlin Emma: “Congressional leaders are charging ahead with negotiations on a deal to skirt $126 billion in spending cuts, even as an internal divide among House Democrats killed their bill staking an opening offer.
“But the Trump administration is reluctant. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Tuesday afternoon that he and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had agreed to begin negotiating a new two-year deal to raise budget caps, starting with discussions among congressional staff.” Read more .
MNUCHIN: WHITE HOUSE, TREASURY DISCUSSED TRUMP TAX RETURN REQUEST — NYT’s Alan Rappeport: “Treasury told lawmakers on Tuesday that White House lawyers had been in touch with his department about a congressional request for President Trump’s tax returns but said he had not personally spoken to Mr. Trump or those lawyers about how the matter was being handled.
“Mr. Mnuchin’s disclosure is the first public acknowledgment of communication between the White House and the Treasury Department related to Mr. Trump’s tax returns. It comes as the president has made clear he has no intention of handing over his personal financial records without a fight.” Read more .
Mnuchin also commented on Brexit — WSJ’s Kate Davidson: “Mnuchin told lawmakers Tuesday that U.S. financial institutions were prepared for the prospect of a disorderly Brexit, but said it would likely cause significant market and trade disruptions. ‘We need to be prepared for a hard Brexit as a very realistic outcome,’ Mr. Mnuchin said at a House hearing on the international financial system.” Read more .
And he butted heads with Waters — AP’s Martin Crutsinger: “Things got a bit heated at the end of more than three hours of testimony by … Mnuchin before the House Financial Services Committee on Tuesday when he was peppered with questions about releasing President Donald Trump’s tax returns. Mnuchin, who had already faced similar questions before a different committee earlier Tuesday, told the committee chairwoman, Maxine Waters, that he needed to leave at 5:15 p.m. to make a 5:30 p.m. meeting in his office with a foreign leader.” Read more .
CFPB WEIGHS OPTIONS FOR ENFORCING WELLS FARGO ORDER — Reuters’ Michelle Price and Imani Moise: “The U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has told Congress that ‘all options are on the table’ for enforcing a 2018 order against Wells Fargo, raising the prospect of potential future penalties or other sanctions again the bank. In a letter to Democratic Senators Elizabeth Warren and Sherrod Brown published by the lawmakers on Tuesday, CFPB Director Kathy Kraninger said she was unhappy with Wells Fargo’s progress fixing its risk management issues.” Read more .
FED TO REVIEW INFLATION TARGETING, POLICY TOOLS — WSJ’s David Harrison: “Federal Reserve vice chairman Richard Clarida said Tuesday that the central bank’s review of its monetary policy will look at new ways to deal with low inflation as well as novel approaches to stimulate a weak economy and to communicate with the public. The Fed kicked off its review this year after officials realized interest rates are likely to remain lower than in the past, even in periods of economic growth. Since lower rates could limit the central bank’s ability to boost a slumping economy, officials are looking for new ways to respond to downturns.” Read more .

CRACKS IN THE SYSTEM — POLITICO’s Matei Rosca: “The financial system is stronger than it was during the global crisis, but some vulnerabilities are growing, warned Randal Quarles, boss of the Financial Stability Board, in a letter from the global regulatory group to the G20 group of countries.
“Loosening lending standards, elevated asset values, and high corporate and public debt call for particular vigilance,” he said. He pointing to collateralized loan obligations and leveraged loans, an asset class dependent on the solvency of companies typically rated below investment grade.”"

QUICK FIX The House easily passed an IRS revamp on Tuesday, but the vote also cause a backlash about the measure’s treatment of the agency’s free file program.
— The Senate has the interest in tax extenders, and until this week hadn’t received a revenue bill from the House. But don’t expect leading Senate tax writers to use the IRS bill as an extenders vehicle.

Driving the Day INTERESTING ALL OF A SUDDEN: It’s not every day you can say a measure that passes the House by voice vote sparked some drama. But that was certainly the case with the Taxpayer First Act, H.R. 1957 (116) , the latest in a series of bipartisan efforts to restructure the IRS.
How it happened: The proposal to codify the IRS’s free file program, a partnership in which tax prep companies like Intuit and H&R Block offer filing services to lower-income taxpayers, was also included in previous versions of IRS bills. But it certainly seems that a ProPublica article outlining that provision , which noted that only around 3 percent of eligible taxpayers currently use the free file program, caught a mostly freshman group of progressives off-guard. And as your Morning Tax author noted , it took Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.), a senior Ways and Means member and sponsor of the measure, talking up the importance of other provisions aimed at helping low-income taxpayers to ease the concerns of those like Reps. Katie Hill (D-Calif.) and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and smooth the bill’s passage.
What’s next? Hill said that progressives are going to try to use the attention caused by Tuesday’s vote to upend the free file program and move toward allowing the IRS to implement its own tax filing system. “We have to use this moment. This is something people are very worked up about,” Hill told Morning Tax. “We have some clout to get movement on this.”
Hill added that progressive lawmakers are hoping to have their own proposal ready by the time Congress returns from its upcoming two-week recess, and that Lewis supports their efforts. But she acknowledged that one potential avenue for rolling back the free file program — making changes to the IRS overhaul in the Senate — would be an uphill battle, given that the other chamber is controlled by Republicans.
Should also be noted: It’s fair to question whether the rebellion against the IRS measure would have been quelled without Lewis, the civil rights hero viewed as a moral authority on both sides of the aisle. “The fact that Lewis got Katie Hill and AOC to come around is unbelievable,” one Democratic aide said. “The man is a legend.”
More on free file: Senate Finance Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), a sponsor of that chamber's Taxpayers First Act, S. 928 (116) , took issue with reports that said the bill would ban the IRS from offering free online tax filing of its own. (A memorandum between the IRS and the tax prep companies says that the agency won’t offer its own filing system, but the IRS can also terminate the program at any time with a year’s notice.) At the same time, Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on Finance and another sponsor of the measure, also took issue with the bill’s “prohibition on the agency competing with private tax preparation services.”
The extenders angle: Grassley has been pushing to revive dozens of expired temporary tax breaks, while House Democrats have been slow to focus on the incentives. That led to some speculation on K Street and elsewhere that Grassley might try to attach the extenders to the IRS bill — the first revenue measure moved by the House this year. But not so fast: Michael Zona, Grassley’s spokesman, told Morning Tax that the chairman still has extenders atop his priority list, but that “it wouldn’t make sense to jeopardize a bicameral, bipartisan agreement that’s the product of many years of work when House Democrats still haven’t shown any interest in moving forward on extenders.” (Another potential revenue bill that could be coming down the pike: The retirement security bill that cleared House Ways and Means last week.)
FIRST LOOK: Rettig returns to Senate Finance today for the first time since his confirmation hearing, and a day after his first testimony as commissioner in front of a House Appropriations subcommittee.
Grassley will say in his opening remarks in today’s hearing that it’s somewhat understandable that “the current tax filing season has been the most scrutinized that I can remember,” given that it’s the first under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, H.R. 1 (115) . The chairman will also note that IRS systems have worked as they’re supposed to so far, and that average refunds are basically in line with previous years.
Tax return update: Today marks the deadline that Neal set for Rettig when requesting Trump’s tax returns, and the commissioner would only say on Tuesday that he’d have some sort of answer today.
Probably the bigger news on tax returns from Tuesday: Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told lawmakers that Treasury lawyers had discussed the Democrats' effort with the White House, albeit before Neal made his formal request, as Pro Tax’s Aaron Lorenzo reported.
INTERNATIONAL UPDATE SURE THAT’S A GOOD IDEA? Japan is looking to hike its sales tax, but The Wall Street Journal’s Mike Bird argues Tokyo should reverse field to save the country’s recent economic progress. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has said the increase is needed because of Japan’s aging population, but has already delayed implementing it once. Bird noted that Japan taxes consumption less than other areas, but also argued that policies that could impede growth could play into China’s hands.

The question is whether it was adequately predicated. And I’m not suggesting that it wasn’t adequately predicated. But I need to explore that.’ …
“While Barr said he would not be launching an investigation into the FBI over the alleged spying, he said it was likely that there was a ‘failure among a group of leaders there at the upper echelon.’ …
“Barr told Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) that he had a conversation with Mueller about why he did not reach a conclusion on the obstruction question. When asked if Mueller sought to leave it to Congress to decide whether Trump obstructed justice, Barr said: ‘He didn’t say that to me.’ When asked if Mueller believed the decision should be up to the attorney general, Barr said: ‘He didn’t say that either. But that’s generally how the Department of Justice works.’” POLITICO
-- REP. JERRY NADLER (D-N.Y.) tweets, regarding Barr’s “spying” statements: “These comments directly contradict what DOJ previously told us. I’ve asked DOJ to brief us immediately. In the meantime, the AG still owes us the full Mueller report.”
-- @desiderioDC: “Big: Barr suggests that his redactions to protect privacy & reputation of ‘peripheral third parties’ would NOT apply to President Trump.”
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP, riffing to reporters this morning: “As far as I’m concerned, I don’t care about the Mueller report.” A guess at why he’s not worried: The president got the headline he wanted from Barr’s letter -- no collusion! -- and, in the White House’s view, that’s good enough even if the report itself contains damaging information. He called the investigation an “attempted coup.” More from Rebecca Morin
-- ON BIBI’S APPARENT WIN: “He’s a great ally and he’s a friend,” Trump said, adding: “Everybody said you can’t have peace in the Middle East with Israel and the Palestinians. I think we have a chance. I think we have now a better chance with Bibi having won.” More from Caitlin Oprysko
-- ON STEPHEN MILLER: A “brilliant man.” Asked whether he’s considered picking the 33-year-old White House aide to replace Kirstjen Nielsen as DHS secretary, given Miller’s expansive role in immigration policy, Trump said: “Frankly, there is only one person that is running it. You know who that is? It’s me.” More from Rebecca Morin
-- ON RELEASING HIS TAX RETURNS: “I would love to give them but I’m not going to do it while I’m under audit. … I have no obligation to do that while under audit and no lawyer would tell you to release your tax returns while you’re under audit.” Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee have set a deadline of today for the Treasury Department to fork them over -- no way that’s happening.
Trump added: “Frankly, the people don’t care.” A recent POLITICO/Morning Consult poll found that 49% of registered voters do care that Trump has not released his tax returns, while 42% do not (8% were undecided). The poll … More from Caitlin Oprysko

She had also been considered for the deputy director role in recent weeks.

JARED VS. EVERYBODY …
-- Anita Kumar: “GOP senators try to undermine Kushner’s immigration plan”: “Sens. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, David Perdue of Georgia and Josh Hawley of Missouri, key allies of President Donald Trump on Capitol Hill, will introduce a bill Wednesday that would favor admitting skilled workers and their immediate family members but cut by half the number of legal immigrants, according to officials close to the process.
“The bill will serve to both challenge [Jared] Kushner’s unexpected effort to increase the number of low- and high-skilled workers, and to remind Trump to make good on his promise to cut both legal and illegal immigration. …
“Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law, who has been working on a plan for months, presented his proposal to the president last week, according to one person familiar with the situation. The president told him he should expand the proposal to include both changes to legal and illegal immigration so as to address what he calls a crisis on the southern border, the person said.” POLITICO
JARED VS. STEPHEN … WaPo’s Ashley Parker, Josh Dawsey and Bob Costa: “Miller and Kushner on a potential collision course in Trump’s border crisis”: “The two political survivors from Trump’s 2016 campaign have emerged as all but untouchable because of their close relationship — and, in [Jared] Kushner’s case, familial ties — with the president. But if [Stephen] Miller represents Trump’s id — reaffirming his hard-line immigration impulses — Kushner attempts to channel the president’s desire to be seen as a consummate dealmaker.” WaPo

THE INVESTIGATIONS … “Hush-Money Probe Gathered Evidence From Trump’s Inner Circle,” by WSJ’s Nicole Hong, Rebecca Ballhaus and Rebecca Davis O’Brien: “The Manhattan U.S. attorney’s office has gathered more evidence than previously known in its criminal investigation of hush payments to two women who alleged affairs with Donald Trump, including from members of the president’s inner circle.
“Prosecutors interviewed Hope Hicks, a former close aide to Mr. Trump and White House communications director, last spring as part of their campaign-finance probe, which ultimately implicated the president in federal crimes. They also spoke to Keith Schiller, Mr. Trump’s former security chief. …
“New details of the investigation — gleaned from interviews with 20 people familiar with the probe and from nearly 1,000 pages of court documents — show prosecutors had gathered information about Mr. Trump’s alleged involvement in the payments weeks before Mr. Cohen asserted it in open court.” WSJ
MORE TROUBLE FOR HERMAN CAIN … WaPo’s Tracy Jan and Heather Long: “She was vilified for accusing Herman Cain of sexual harassment. Eight years later, she has no regrets”: “[Sharon] Bialek’s experience, after she accused Cain of groping beneath her skirt and pushing her head toward his crotch when she came to him in 1997 seeking employment advice, offers a rare glimpse of an often overlooked aspect of sexual misconduct allegations. What happens to the women who come forward with accusations against men in positions of power, once the story has moved on?
“Now back in the spotlight — this time in the Me Too era when a number of prominent men have been accused of sexual harassment — Bialek said she expects her allegations to be part of Cain’s vetting process. She is willing to testify before the Senate Banking Committee if called upon. And she said Cain’s past behavior with women, including three others who have accused him of sexual harassment, should disqualify him from the Fed post.” WaPo
-- TRUMP was asked by reporters this morning whether his pick of Cain to serve on the Fed board is safe, and said “I like Herman Cain and Herman will make that determination. … As to how he’s doing in the process, that I don’t know. … Herman’s a great guy and I hope he does well.”

RIP OPM? -- “If Trump has his way, this major federal agency is on the way out,” by WaPo’s Lisa Rein and Damian Paletta: “If the Trump administration succeeds at dismantling the Office of Personnel Management, the closure could be a blueprint for shuttering other departments as it tries to shrink government.
“The agency would be pulled apart and its functions divided among three other departments. An executive order directing parts of the transition by the fall is in the final stages of review, administration officials said, with an announcement by President Trump likely by summer. OPM employees were briefed at a meeting in March. For Trump, the breakup of the 5,565-employee federal personnel agency would offer a jolt of bureaucratic defibrillation to a slow-to-change workforce that the president and his top aides have targeted as a symptom of a sluggish, inefficient government.” WaPo
-- The key question: But who would tell us about D.C. snow days?
HEALTH CARE LATEST … “Republicans Revive Efforts to Preserve Health-Law Provisions,” by WSJ’s Andrew Duehren: “The legislation is an opportunity for Republicans to show that they also support protecting pre-existing conditions, as the party gears up for another election cycle, according to a Senate GOP aide. Republicans may push for it to become law if the ACA is invalidated in court, the aide said.” WSJ
-- “Sanders unveils revamped ‘Medicare for All’ plan,” by Adam Cancryn: “Sen. Bernie Sanders tried to stake his position as the leading progressive in a crowded presidential field on Wednesday by rolling out a ‘Medicare for All’ plan, in the process reopening divisions among Democrats after President Donald Trump united them with his renewed assault on Obamacare.” POLITICO

2020 WATCH -- “Burned in 2016, unions hold back endorsements,” by Ian Kullgren and Natasha Korecki: “Even as Democratic contenders are well into the process of courting high-ranking and local labor officials, union leaders plan to delay their endorsements as they take the temperature of members on the ground in an attempt to avoid the top-down approach that caused so much heartburn. …
“The candidates will face one of their first hurdles Wednesday when nine of them speak at a conference of the North America’s Building Trades Unions. The federation of construction unions will serve as an early litmus test for winning over blue-collar workers in swing states that went for Donald Trump over Clinton.” POLITICO
BEYOND THE BELTWAY -- “Eying Supreme Court, abortion foes promote tough state bans,” by AP’s David Crary: “Emboldened by the new conservative majority on the Supreme Court, anti-abortion lawmakers and activists in numerous states are pushing near-total bans on the procedure in a deliberate frontal attack on Roe v. Wade.
“Mississippi and Kentucky have passed laws that would ban most abortions after a fetal heartbeat is detected — which means as early as six weeks, when many women don’t even know they’re pregnant. Georgia could join them if Republican Gov. Brian Kemp signs a measure that has been sent to him, and similar bills are pending in at least eight other states with anti-abortion GOP majorities in their legislatures.” AP
WHAT NIKKI HALEY’S UP TO -- “Former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley has book coming in the fall,” by AP’s Hillel Italie: “St. Martin’s Press announced Wednesday that Haley’s book, currently untitled, will come out this fall. According to the publisher, the 47-year-old Haley will write about her experiences as ambassador in 2017-18 and her six years before that as governor, sharing ‘the consequential actions, decisions, confrontations, and behind-the-scenes negotiations that shaped national and world events.’ Haley also will offer ‘deeply personal’ insights and the ‘challenges’ she faced as a woman during her time in government.” AP

Bockorny lobbyist heads to Invariant - POLITICO,www.politico.com,politico.com,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/newsletters/politico-influence/2019/04/10/bockorny-lobbyist-heads-to-invariant-423379,"With David Beavers and Daniel Lippman BOCKORNY LOBBYIST HEADS TO INVARIANT: Nicole Venable is leaving the Bockorny Group , where she was the lead Democratic lobbyist, to join Invariant . She lobbied for clients including CVS Health , FedEx and Target at the Bockorny Group and expects to bring some clients with her, according to Invariant. She’s also a former lobbyist for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and a former chief of staff to former Rep. William Jefferson (D-La.). She’s the second Democrat who’s joined Invariant in recent weeks, along with Quincy Enoch , a former lobbyist for the National Association of Mutual Insurance Companies .
LONGTIME RAILROAD LOBBYIST STARTS HER OWN FIRM: Susan Andres , a longtime lobbyist for the Union Pacific railroad, has started her own lobbying firm, the Cactus Group . (The name is a nod to Arizona, where she grew up.) She’s signed two clients so far — the Association of American Railroads and Merck — and plans to add two more in the coming weeks, she told PI in an interview. She’ll focus on trade, health care and appropriations work, among other issues.
— Andres has particularly strong relationships with many of the eight Republican women in the Senate and the 13 in the House, she said. She’s involved in the Value in Electing Women PAC and E-PAC , the leadership PAC of Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.), both of which support female Republican candidates. She wrote personal checks last year to the campaigns of Sen. Deb Fischer (R-Neb.) and Reps. Martha Roby (R-Ala.) and Susan Brooks (R-Ind.), according to campaign finance records. “It’s time for the party to look more like America than it has” in the past, Andres said.

HOW MUCH THE BANKS ON THE HILL TODAY SPENT ON LOBBYING: The chief executives of seven major bank and investment firms — Bank of America , Bank of New York Mellon , Citigroup , Goldman Sachs , JPMorgan Chase , Morgan Stanley and State Street Corporation — arrived on the Hill this morning to testify before the House Financial Services Committee. As you might expect, all of them have a presence in Washington. The seven companies together spent $14.8 million on Washington lobbying last year, filings. Citigroup spent the most, at $4.5 million; State Street spent the least, at $1.5 million. All of them also have active corporate PACs that give to members of Congress — including, of course, members of the committee.
FLYING IN: Hundreds of members of the U.S Travel Association will hit the Hill on Thursday to push for infrastructure spending and greater investment in national parks, among other issues.

LINCOLN JOINS FARMERS CAMPAIGN: Farmers for Free Trade , a nonprofit pushing for ratification of President Donald Trump ’s trade deal with Canada and Mexico, has brought on former Sen. Blanche Lincoln (D-Ark.) as senior adviser and spokesperson. Lincoln’s lobbying firm, Lincoln Policy Group , has been retained by the campaign in a primarily public relations capacity, Hannah Lambiotte Smith , Lincoln Policy Group vice president and managing director, told PI. The firm has no immediate plans to lobby for the campaign. During the April congressional recess, the group will tour the country in a 25-foot RV emblazoned with messages about agricultural trade with Canada and Mexico. The group has also been a vocal opponent of President Donald Trump ’s tariffs.
— Lincoln, of course, isn’t the only former Democratic lawmaker on K Street pushing for the deal. Former Rep. Joe Crowley (D-N.Y.), who’s now at Squire Patton Boggs , is serving as the honorary co-chairman of the Pass USMCA Coalition, whose members include the National Association of Manufacturers , Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America and Domino’s Pizza , among others.

Mnuchin: China to establish ‘enforcement office’ as part of any U.S. deal,www.politico.com,ADAM BEHSUDI,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/10/mnuchin-us-china-trade-1342091,"The United States and China are working on the establishment of an “enforcement office“ to help Beijing live up to commitments it makes in a trade deal with the Trump administration, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin reiterated on Wednesday.
“We will have a process on both sides with significant resources,” Mnuchin said during the annual Bretton Woods Committee conference in Washington.
The two countries have “pretty much agreed on an enforcement mechanism,” Mnuchin said in an interview on CNBC earlier the same day. “We’ve agreed that both sides will establish enforcement offices that will deal with the ongoing matters. This is something both sides are taking very seriously.”
Those comments echoed what Mnuchin told a House Financial Services Committee hearing earlier this week. The enforcement office will be under Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, he said Tuesday.
At the Bretton Woods event, Mnuchin declined to go into more detail about the enforcement setup, but said he mentioned the concept to “emphasize the commitment both sides have” in terms of enforcing a deal.
Mnuchin said he was “cautiously hopeful” the two sides could reach an overarching agreement to address China’s industrial policies that the U.S. has criticized.
President Donald Trump met with Liu last week when China’s chief negotiator was visiting Washington for a round of talks with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer. Trump said he was hopeful a deal could be reached within the next month but a White House statement after the meeting said “significant work remains.”
The two sides have yet to reach a compromise on the conditions under which the U.S. will agree to withdraw tariffs on more than $250 billion worth of Chinese imports, according to a source briefed on the talks.
Reaction to the news that the U.S. and China reached a deal on enforcement was cautious on Capitol Hill.
“I feel very good, if that information is accurate,” Senate Finance Chairman Chuck Grassley said Wednesday. “There’s only one caveat I’d put on this statement: Mnuchin is making the statement instead of Lighthizer. Mnuchin is a little softer on trade issues with China than Lighthizer is, but they’re a team so maybe they’re on the same page.“
Mnuchin said he and Lighthizer spoke by phone with Liu last night for “a very long time” and another call was scheduled for Thursday morning.
He said a deal with China will be comprised of seven chapters and said a chapter to address currency manipulation is “basically complete.”
“I would say this is one of the strongest currency agreements we have reached,” he said.

DeVos 'not familiar' with affirmative action guidance her agency scrapped,www.politico.com,BENJAMIN WERMUND,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/10/betsy-devos-affirmative-action-1342089," DeVos told a House panel Wednesday that she is ""not familiar"" with affirmative action guidance for schools that the Trump administration rescinded last summer or with a major Supreme Court ruling on which portions of the guidance were based.
The administration in July rescinded several guidance documents issued by the Education and Justice departments under the Obama administration that called on school superintendents and colleges to consider race when diversifying their campuses.
They included 2011 guidelines for public schools that detailed a number of ways that school districts could consider diversity without making decisions based on the race of individual students. The Obama guidance stressed that school districts must “use race-neutral approaches only if they are workable.” But when they’re not, “school districts may employ generalized race-based approaches.”
Under questioning on Wednesday from Rep. David Trone (D-Md.) about the move to scrap the guidance, DeVos said she is ""not familiar with that particular document."" The exchange came during DeVos' first appearance before the House Education Committee since Democrats took control of the chamber.
When asked about a 2007 Supreme Court ruling, Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District No. 1 , which portions of the guidance were based on, DeVos said, ""I'm not familiar with that particular case.""
A majority of the justices in the ruling recognized that seeking diversity and avoiding racial isolation are compelling interests for school districts but ruled the Seattle school district’s use of race as the second most important tiebreaker in high school admissions was unconstitutional.
Trone told DeVos that the ""rescission of that guidance has caused confusion and fear about the intent of the Trump administration.""
""So I’d like to give you an opportunity to clarify,"" he said. ""I want to be clear that no matter what your action is, federal law and Supreme Court precedent still stands.""
DeVos responded: ""It’s valuable for every student to be in a school setting that has great diversity. I think it’s valuable for every student.
""The goal should be to have diversity of every sort,"" DeVos said. ""The Supreme Court has opined in this and has given very clear guidance.""
Earlier in the exchange, Trone asked DeVos whether she believes racial segregation ""poses a threat to the educational opportunities for children of color,"" to which DeVos responded: ""I’m concerned about every student, no matter where they are and where they go to school.""
Trone pressed her again, saying, ""That’s an easy one, give me a yes on that one.""
""I am concerned with every student,"" DeVos responded.
The questions came a day after revelations that Texas Tech University’s medical school would stop considering race in admissions under an agreement with the Trump administration, which has targeted affirmative action in college admissions.
The Texas Tech agreement marked the first time the administration has reached a resolution in a probe of the use of race in admissions — and it could foretell how the administration will proceed with ongoing investigations into whether Harvard and Yale universities are discriminating against Asian-American applicants in their use of race in admissions.
The Justice Department, separately, has also backed a lawsuit targeting Harvard's use of race in admissions.
Rep. Bobby Scott (D-Va.), the chairman of the committee, told DeVos at the end of the hearing that Democrats will follow up on questions about the diversity guidance, as “you seem to be a little unclear on that.""
