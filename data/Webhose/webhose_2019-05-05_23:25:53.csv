Kind-hearted Grand National offers to fly injured horses to Dignitas rather than shooting them in the head on the track,newsthump.com,Pete Redfern,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://newsthump.com/2019/04/06/kind-hearted-grand-national-offers-to-fly-injured-horses-to-dignitas-rather-than-shooting-them-in-the-head-on-the-track/,"Radio Saturday 6 April 2019 by Pete Redfern Kind-hearted Grand National offers to fly injured horses to Dignitas rather than shooting them in the head on the track
The organisers of the Grand National have responded to accusations of animal cruelty by offering to fly injured horses to Switzerland to be put out of their misery.
After facing accusations every year that whipping horses and riding them to within an inch of their life before killing any that are injured in the process is unnecessary and cruel, the Grand National organisers have extended an offer of kindness in an attempt to appease pesky animal lovers.
“We will naturally continue to race horses, because there is a lot of money in it, and my Range Rover Sport and third divorce won’t pay for themselves,” explained Grand National spokesman Simon Williams.
“And yes, some of those horses may fall and be injured during the races and require putting down, and this is a perfectly natural way for horses to die.
“But we appreciate that shooting a horse in the back of the head from close range is a bit undignified. So for those fillies that become slightly injured and need to be put down as a side effect of our entertainment, the best we can do is fly them to Switzerland and slip them a pill as they soak up the glorious views in relative privacy.”
He added, “Just send me the medal for compassion and a cheque to cover the costs of the flights, and I’ll get things in place.” "

"Saturday Ethics Warm-Up, 4/6/2019: Who’s The Worst? [CORRECTED]",ethicsalarms.com,Jack Marshall,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://ethicsalarms.com/2019/04/06/saturday-ethics-warm-up-4-6-2019-whos-the-worst/,"/ Jack Marshall Good morning!
The day got off to a grand start when the first thing that came up on TV was the ending of John Wayne’s “True Grit.” When the Coen Brothers did their (dark) remake starring Jeff Bridges as Rooster Cogburn, I wondered which version would survive as the definitive one. Sometimes remakes of classic films obliterate the originals, like “The Thing,” or “Invasion of the Body-Snatchers.” Sometimes the original films are so obviously superior that the remake just vanishes. Sometimes it should vanish, but doesn’t, like the ugly “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory” created by Tim Burton. Both “True Grit’s ” are excellent, but so far, at least, the Duke’s Oscar-willing performance has prevailed. Good.
1. From the “You can’t fool all of the people all the time, especially if you’re a callow, arrogant fool” files: Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez offended an audience made up predominantly of African Americans when she slipped into assumed regional slang to lecture them about the dignity of menial jobs for life
“I’m proud to be a bartender, ain’t nothing wrong with that! ” Ocasio-Cortez proclaimed. [CORRECTION NOTE: Originally, the version of this statement I had was an Ebonics-fest that I got off of a tweet from an attendee. This was incorrect: thanks to Chris Marschner for the fact check. ]
Actually, the real offense was her content, not her delivery. This is communist cant for the proles: don’t aspire to more than your hum-drum jobs, for you are serving the greater good (and your superior overlords). That’s not the American values system, or American culture, which encourages productive dissatisfaction, personal initiative, and determination to be better and do better.
2. I knew Harvard wouldn’t be able to duck the college admission scandal! Harvard has launched an “independent investigation” into a series of suspicious events that occurred in 2016. Wealthy businessman Jie “Jack” Zhaopaid inexplicably paid $989,500 for a home in the Boston suburbs that was valued at only $549,300. Seventeen months later he sold that home for $665,000, for a loss of $324,000.
The home he purchased was being sold by famed Harvard fencing coach Peter Brand, who was already coaching Zhoapaid’s older Harvard undergrad son, Eric. Brand and his wife purchased a $1.3 million condominium in Cambridge a week after their house was sold to Zhao that just coincidentally had been listed at $989,000, nearly the exact the amount ($989,500) Brand had been paid by Zhao. Shortly thereafter, Zhao’s younger son, Edward, was admitted into Harvard as a student-athlete and member of the fencing team.
Coincidences! It’s all coincidences and circumstantial evidence! Zhao insists that his real estate transactions were completely unrelated to Harvard’s admissions process.
Sure. At very least, Brand should be fired for this multiple conflict of interest scenario and creating an appearance of impropriety damaging to the university.
3. This is what George Will calls “condign justice”. .. A Nashville woman had dated Gregory Cole for four years until he accidentally butt-dialed her in the midst of a sexual encounter with a man, though Cole had always represented himself as strictly heterosexual. She listened to the whole call, which included explicit sexual conversation and vivid narration of various, uh, actions. The call lasted 1 hour and 28 minutes. Cole’s now ex-girl friend got tested, and learned she was infected with HSV-2, genital herpes, which is incurable. She has now filed a lawsuit against Cole seeking $1 million, alleging battery, infliction of emotional distress, negligence, and fraud.
Good. THAT’s betrayal, and no, she shouldn’t forgive him.
I must add, however, that butt-call ethics require that the one who receives such a call immediately hang up . In this case, however, it’s a good thing she didn’t.
4. More from our moral superiors Down Under: Knee-jerking to the March 15 attacks in Christchurch in which a white supremacist used a helmet-mounted camera to stream on Facebook his massacre of worshippers in two New Zealand mosques, Australia’s Parliament passed legislation this week holding social media executives criminally liable if their platforms stream real violence.
“Together we must act to ensure that perpetrators and their accomplices cannot leverage online platforms for the purpose of spreading their violent and extreme propaganda — these platforms should not be weaponized for evil,” Attorney General Christian Porter told Parliament while introducing the bill, which was passed without the usual procedure of a committee scrutinizing its content first.
The law makes it a crime for social media platforms not to remove “abhorrent violent material” quickly, and such negligence will be punishable by three years in prison and a fine of 10.5 million Australian dollars ($7.5 million), or 10% of the platform’s annual turnover, whichever is larger. The law defines as “abhorrent violent material” acts of terrorism, murder, attempted murder, torture, rape and kidnapping. The material must be recorded by the perpetrator or an accomplice for the law to apply. Platforms anywhere in the world would face fines of up to AU$840,000 ($597,500) if they fail to notify Australian Federal Police if they are aware their service was streaming “abhorrent violent conduct” occurring in Australia.
Objecting to the measure, Arthur Moses, president of the Australian Law Council, the Australian ABA, said the law could lead to media censorship—gee, ya think? — and prevent whistleblowers from using social media to expose atrocities
Executives of Facebook, Google, Twitter, internet service providers and Australian phone companies had met with Prime Minister Scott Morrison and three ministers last week to discuss proposed social media regulation. Facebook apparently “did not present any immediate solutions to the issues arising out of the horror that occurred in Christchurch.”
The solution is to focus on the criminals and the crime, not on hiding it. I see no block on the slippery slope from making real-life transmissions of violence illegal to making social media portrayals of fictional violence equally punishable, and then the portrayals themselves.
The frightening aspect of this story is how many Americans, ignorant of their own Constitution and the essential role the First Amendment plays in keeping us free, will applaud this law. We know Christiane Amanpour will approve of.
I would guess that most of the totalitarian-trending, anti-Second Amendment Democratic Presidential wannabes will cheer it on as well. And at Fark, the snarky news aggregator with 21st Century sensibilities, the story is tagged, “Cool.”"
The Forgiveness Of Victoria Ruvolo,ethicsalarms.com,Jack Marshall,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://ethicsalarms.com/2019/04/06/the-forgiveness-of-victoria-ruvolo/,"/ Jack Marshall
I’m not great on forgiveness; it’s not one of my virtues. I especially don’t forgive betrayal, but there are other kinds of behavior that I don’t forgive. There are three local theater companies in the D.C. area that I will go out of my way to undermine and if possible, destroy, for the disgusting culture they revealed to me when I had the misfortune to work with them. When my son was four, a local T.G.I.F. that we often frequented treated our family like bugs, then using the excuse that they were short-staffed (their problem, not mine) and offering me a coupon to entice me to come to their crappy restaurant again when it had just given us a humiliating experience. I told the manager to keep his sop, and that we would never set foot in his restaurant again, and we never have. My son is now 24. My problem with unearned forgiveness is that it diminishes the appreciation of accountability. The fact that when you behave unethically people resent it and no longer trust you is a powerful motivation to be better.
Victoria Ruvolo, who died last week at the age of 59 , disagreed. Here is her own description of what happened to her. Her journey began when on November 12, 2004, when six teenagers in Ronkonkoma, New York bought a 20 pound turkey with a stolen credit card. 18 year-old Ryan Cushing threw the frozen-solid bird out of a back seat window, and it crashed through the windshield of the car driven by Victoria Ruvolo’s and crushed her face. Her passenger managed to steer the car to the side of the road. Ruvolo awoke in a hospital several weeks later with no knowledge of what had happened. The missile had broken the bones in her cheeks and jaw, fractured her left eye socket, collapsed her esophagus and left her with a closed-head brain injury.
Later, she wrote,
I had no idea I’d had ten hours of surgery and I was shocked when the doctors told me that from now on, for the rest of my life, I would always have three titanium plates in my left cheek, one in my right cheek, and I’d also have a wire mesh holding my left eye in place because my left eye socket was so badly shattered.
Once I got off the medication, I remember lying in the bedroom at my sister’s house and just crying myself to sleep and asking: Why me God? What did I ever do so wrong and so terrible in my life that I deserved all this to happen to me? And I’d cry myself to sleep. But then, gradually, it began to dawn on me that perhaps God had allowed me to live through this ordeal because I was in such great physical condition. The idea that it had happened for a reason – and that I had saved someone else who might not have been able to survive – helped me get through rehabilitation.
Then the District Attorney informed me that the other teenagers who had been with Ryan had entered a plea bargain to testify against him. This, coupled with overwhelming evidence, was enough to put Ryan in jail for 25 years. It was at this point that I started asking questions about Ryan. Had he always been a bully? Was he always hurting other people? What could possibly have built up inside him so bad that he had to throw something so hard? Because I’d experienced the death of two brothers when I was much younger, I felt strongly that I didn’t want be responsible for taking this other young person’s life. I didn’t want Ryan to rot in jail.
That’s when I asked to meet with Ryan’s lawyer to be able to tell him that I wanted an amnesty for Ryan or at least a lesser sentence. On the day we went to court, I saw this young man walk in wearing a suit which looked like it was three times too big for him; it made him seem so frail. He walked in with his head hung down and looked so upset with himself. When I saw him there, my heart went out to him. To me he looked like a lost soul.
Once the case was over and it was time for him to walk out, he started veering over towards where I was sitting and every court officer was ready to jump on him. They had no idea why he was coming towards me but as he walked over to where I was sitting and stood in front of me, I saw that all he was doing was crying, crying profusely. He looked at me and said, ‘I never meant this to happen to you, I prayed for you every day. I’m so glad you’re doing well.’ Then this motherly instinct just came over me and all I could do was take him and cuddle him like a child and tell him ‘just do something good with your life, take this experience and do something good with your life.’ Cushing was sentenced to only six months in jail and five years probation. Apparently he has a job and has stayed out of trouble. After Ruvolo’s recovery, she lectured about empathy and forgiveness at schools and for various programs. One of her frequent sponsors was Taste (Thinking Errors, Anger Management, Social Skills and Talking Empathy). Robert Goldman, its founder, said of Victoria that Cushing’s life symbolizes her legacy: “She’s an example of forgiveness in a vengeful world.”
Honestly, I’m not convinced that Victoria’s compassion wasn’t misplaced. The fact that Ruvolo and her passenger weren’t killed by Cushing’s stupid act was pure moral luck. If they had been killed, he would have paid for the consequences with much of his life. Why should luck determine society’s response to conduct this cruel and irresponsible? For that matter, why should the victim? It is society’s laws that are violated, and society that has been damaged and challenged. What happened to Cushing as a result of his own decisions would not be Victoria’s fault or responsibility, and prosecutors are supposed to understand that their client is the state, not the victim. It is also moral luck that Cushing turned out not to be a stone-cold sociopath or psychopath, and was given a chance to hurt others.
No doubt, Victoria’s forgiveness was healthy for her as well as a boon for her attacker. Whether it was in the best interest of society, civilization and the rule of law, however, is an open question for me."
