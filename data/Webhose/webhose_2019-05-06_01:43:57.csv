'The Old Drift' Takes The Long View Of Human (And Mosquito) History,www.gpb.org,Annalisa Quinn,04-07-2019,2019,4,http://www.gpb.org/post/old-drift-takes-long-view-human-and-mosquito-history,"By Annalisa Quinn • 1 hour ago
""We're your oldest friend, your ancient enemy ..."" warn the chorus of Namwali Serpell's lush speculative novel The Old Drift .
Can you guess who they are? ""We're perfectly matched ..."" they say. ""We're both useless, ubiquitous species. But while you all rule the earth and destroy it for kicks, we linger and loaf, unsung heroes. We've been around here as long as you have — for eons before, say the fossils.""
A mosquito chorus drifts through this ambitious multigenerational epic set in Zambia, providing the long view of human history from a species that knows us down to our skin and blood. ""To err is human, that's your doom and delight,"" they tell us, and prove it, showing Zambia as a confected nation, an error of colonialism and history.
Serpell begins with the colonial explorer Dr. Livingstone, felled by malaria while looking for the source of the Nile in the wrong place: ""This is the story of a nation — not a kingdom or people — so it begins, of course, with a white man."" Through the stories of three overlapping families, European, African, and Indian, she then presents the history (and future) of Zambia, through colonialism, Zambian independence, the AIDS epidemic, the ill-fated Zambian Space Program , the Kariba dam, revolution, and forward into the age of mass surveillance and drone warfare.
The later chapters of The Old Drift depict a near future in which devices called Beads — a bit like smartphones — are embedded in human hands. Predictably, they quickly become a tool for government surveillance and control. Meanwhile, a vaccine developed with foreign money is being tested on unwitting Zambians: ""[B]lack people have always made great guinea pigs,"" one character remarks bitterly.
To err also means to wander, and The Old Drift does, shamelessly: It does not acknowledge restraints of species or time or perspective or taste or page length (568). Like a mosquito swarm, the narrative hovers, drifts, and returns elliptically to the same places again and again. Serpell will use, for instance, three different metaphors in a row to describe the night sky: ""The scroll of the night unrolled, flat as it ever was, its uneven Braille twinkling down. The black sack scattered its loot of light back across the universe again. And the vast night tree under which we all stand bloomed with pale blossoms once more.""
Serpell's style is florid, but the excess often comes with a point. These are indeed three ways humans think about space: As something legible and predictive, as a resource to exploit, and as a source of beauty and awe. You also get the sense that the descriptive excess is a conscious choice; as one character says, ""[W]hat ruined this country was efficiency — the British worship of efficiency."" And while she is sweeping in scope and gesture, she can also be precise, especially about smells and sounds: ""[h]is pulse ticked faintly, erratically, like cooling metal,"" a woman ""let out a languorous ululation like a glugging drain,"" stones of a gravel drive ""gurgled affably"" under the wheels of a car. Serpell's style is florid, but the excess often comes with a point. -
Serpell also performs exquisite acts of literary ventriloquism (in addition to scattered allusions from Shakespeare to Milton to Lucretius to Virgil). The final chapter is a close reworking of the opening of Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness , and the first chapter is written in the pitch-perfect voice of a jolly, cruel British colonist: ""The worst difficulty of exploration, I learned, is that it is a tormenting isolation. There was no chumming it up with the blacks, naturally.""
In the final chapters, three young people, descendants of the three family lines traced in The Old Drift , mount a revolution by hacking the Beads and using the mosquitoes' robotic twins, tiny solar-powered drones, to mount an attack on a system of oppression in place since the founding of Zambia. ""Power's just an accident that depends on the weakness of others,"" says one of the revolutionaries. ""They grabbed what they could get for the sake of what they could get."" These chapters have a wonderful, apocalyptic finality, with floods and flames, speeches and sacrifice.
The Old Drift offers a view of human history characterized by generative mistakes, from Dr Livingstone's fatal calculation about the source of the Nile to evolution itself: ""Don't forget evolution forged the entirety of life using only one tool: the mistake ..."" To err is human, we hear again and again. But the second half of that maxim, the part about forgiveness, isn't mentioned. You get the sense it might be beside the point to Serpell's youngest generation of characters, with their scalding assessments of injustice and cruelty by those in power. They're not here to forgive. They're here for the revolution. Copyright 2019 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org. © 2019 Georgia Public Broadcasting"
"Chef's Memoir Tackles What It's Like To Be Young, Gifted And Black In Fine Dining",www.gpb.org,,04-07-2019,2019,4,http://www.gpb.org/post/chefs-memoir-tackles-what-its-be-young-gifted-and-black-fine-dining,"By Lourdes Garcia-Navarro & Maria Godoy • 2 hours ago Chef Kwame Onwuachi in the dining room of his celebrated Washington, D.C. restaurant, Kith and Kin. Noah Fortson/NPR
It was the morning after the election of America's first black president, and Kwame Onwuachi was hungover. He'd been partying all night. He was dealing drugs to survive after he dropped out of college. He was, he says, lost.
But when he saw President Obama, something clicked. ""I thought, I can do anything. And I immediately flushed everything that I had down the toilet and was like, I need to find myself,"" Onwuachi recalls.
He went to the grocery store and bought ingredients to cook a chicken curry. ""I didn't know that I wanted to cook, but it was like, here's something that I'm familiar with,"" he says. ""Here's something that brings back these fond memories. And here's something that grounds me. And I want to explore this a little bit more.""
These days, Onwuachi is a rising star in the food world — the executive chef at Kith and Kin , a celebrated Afro-Caribbean restaurant in Washington, D.C., and a nominee this year for a prestigious James Beard award.
His road to the rarefied world of fine cuisine has had many fits and starts, which he details in a new memoir, Notes From A Young Black Chef. Eventually, there would be a stint on Top Chef, work in the best restaurants in America, the opening of his first place in D.C. — and its rapid and painful closure. But that road began in a one-bedroom apartment in the Bronx, where he grew up with his mother and sister.
""My mother was an accountant and she wanted to figure out a way to spend time with us while still taking care of the bills,"" Onwuachi says. ""So she started a catering company from the house, and me and my sister became her first two employees.""
Times were hard. ""There were a lot of times where we didn't have lights,"" he says, ""and my mother made up a game called Lights Out, where we all slept in the living room together and put candles everywhere. She shielded me with love, instead of revealing to me the harsh realities that were going on.""
Onwuachi's life story is written in his recipes. His mother's family hails from Louisiana and Trinidad. Creole and Caribbean flavors infuse his cooking. On his father's side, there are roots in Jamaica and Nigeria, where Onwuachi spent two years as a tween. Onwuachi's life story is written in his recipes. Here, a plate of charred brassicas, served with Nigerian red sauce. Noah Fortson/NPR
""I was definitely veering off on the wrong path as a kid growing up in the South Bronx,"" he says. So his mother sent him to live with his father's relatives in Nigeria. ""I spent a couple of years there, learning about my culture, my ancestors' traditions that I wasn't familiar with. And then inherently, I also learned a lot about cooking.""
In Nigeria, he says, ""if you wanted 20 wings, you had to raise 10 chickens. You saw where the food came from.""
He took all that experience into the high temples of American cuisine – first, Per Se, and then Eleven Madison Park , both in New York City. He says he wanted to learn from the best.
""It was and still is an amazing restaurant,"" he says of the highly acclaimed Per Se. ""The food that they produce, the level of attention to detail that goes into every single aspect — whether it's the receiving of produce to putting that said produce through a process of fabrication, the cookery and then onto the plate. It's a symphony.""
But Onwuachi's memoir is not a simple story about triumph in the face of poverty and struggle. It's also a meditation on what goes on behind that perfect façade --- what it is like to be a black man in this rarefied world. He tells the story of alerting the head chef to a word that has a double meaning as a racist slur that was being used on the menu. He was told not to worry about it because ""black people don't eat here."" Onwuachi cooks in the kitchen of his D.C. restaurant, Kith and Kin. His food encompasses a range of African, Caribbean, African-American and other influences. Noah Fortson/NPR
""These jokes happen more than you think,"" Onwuachi says. ""We get looked over [for advancement] more than you think. And it's not the direct racism. ... it's the unspoken racism that's hurtful.""
So Onwauchi left to open his own restaurant. He was only 26, and people kept telling him he had not paid his dues. When his first D.C. venture, Shaw Bijou, closed in under three months in a highly publicized failure , people seemed almost gleeful.
""It infuriated me at the time,"" Onwuachi says. ""People telling you that you haven't paid your dues — what are you talking? I've been afforded an opportunity. Who in their right mind is going to say, 'Thank you for this million-dollar offer, but I need to go and pay my dues a little bit more and then I'll call you back if you're still interested'?""
These days, Onwuachi is earning rave reviews for his new restaurant, Kith and Kin. And he wants people to think about why critics and customers deem only certain cuisines – Italian, French, Japanese — worthy of the name fine dining.
""You don't have Southeast Asian there. You don't have Caribbean [food], or all of the [African] diaspora, which is like 54 different countries. You know, one of them's got to have a food that you can respect at a high level, right?""
To change minds, he says, ""I think it's going to take a lot more chefs of color to introduce these this type of cuisine to people at a high level.""
Onwuachi sees his own culinary repertoire as a counter to these food world stereotypes. While his food encompasses a range of African, Caribbean, African-American and other influences, one cuisine he doesn't do is what some diners might expect of a young black chef: soul food.
""My roots are not fried chicken and mac and cheese and collard greens,"" he says. ""I mean, that's part of it. But when I have family reunions, we don't cook that food. We cook gumbo and shrimp. So those are the things that resonate with me. But also, I'm a black chef. So the food that I cook is black.""
""I don't need to be pigeonholed into soul food or even Creole food or even just Caribbean food or West African food. I'm a culmination of many different cultures, and the ideas that I have are because of that."" Copyright 2019 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org. © 2019 Georgia Public Broadcasting"
Shelters And City Governments Scramble To Help Migrants In The Rio Grande Valley,www.gpb.org,editor,04-07-2019,2019,4,http://www.gpb.org/post/shelters-and-city-governments-scramble-help-migrants-rio-grande-valley,"Shelters And City Governments Scramble To Help Migrants In The Rio Grande Valley By Reynaldo Leanos Jr. • 3 hours ago Good Neighbor Settlement House in Brownsville, Texas, is helping recently released migrants by offering them a meal, shower and some new clothes before journeying up north to await their day in immigration court. Eric Gay / AP Listening... /
More than 76,000 people were apprehended or surrendered on the Southern border in February and administration officials project that number would surpass 100,000 for March.
The highest number of crossings are taking place in Texas' Rio Grande Valley.
The Good Neighbor Settlement House, a homeless shelter in Brownsville, Texas, is now also being used to house migrants released from U.S. Customs and Border Protection custody. They normally help a couple dozen migrants a day, but recently the numbers shot up to more than 400 a day. We don't intend to back off of the mission we embrace. They can keep sending them, we're going to serve them. - Jack White, director, Good Neighbor Settlement House
The migrants are brought here for a short period of time and can shower, eat and get some clean clothes. Volunteers help migrants work out travel arrangements so they can meet up with relatives or sponsors in other parts of the country while they await their day in immigration court.

The shelter started their Refugee Respite Program in August at the request of Catholic Charities of the Rio Grande Valley. Jack White, the director of Good Neighbor, says he's recently seen a spike in numbers and they are no longer receiving advance notice from CBP when migrants are being released.
Still, White says, they're dealing with it.
""Will it be hard?"" asked White. ""Yes, but we don't intend to back off of the mission we embrace. They can keep sending them, we're going to serve them.""
Migrants usually arrive at the shelter with some documentation about relatives or sponsors to contact to arrange shelter while they await their immigration court proceedings — that wait can take months, even years, because of the huge backlog of cases.
But Marianela Ramirez-Watson, the director for the Refugee Respite Program, says last weekend they ran into a new problem.
""A group of people showed up without their paperwork and so the minute we caught it we called CBP and they said, 'Oh my gosh, they weren't supposed to send that bus yet,' "" said Ramirez-Watson. ""Some confusion when you're dealing with as many people as they are.""
While local organizations, like Good Neighbor, handle the releases, the Trump administration continues to call on Congress to change immigration laws to stave off what they consider a national emergency at the border.
But César Cuauhtémoc García Hernández says the real crisis isn't with people asking for asylum, it's with the immigration system itself.
García Hernández is an associate professor of law at the University of Denver and a Rio Grande Valley native. He said it's important to point out that this administration has already made some changes in an effort to limit the number of asylum-seekers.
""[In the past] a person could make a claim, a successful claim for asylum based on abuse by a violent spouse. Or because of violence being inflicted by the gangs that are destabilizing much of Central America,"" said García Hernández. ""The Trump administration has made it almost impossible to make those claims.""
Still, the asylum-seekers keep coming.
As Good Neighbor braces for more, Brownsville's mayor, Tony Martinez, said his city has adapted to the challenge pretty well. Martinez said CBP said to expect nearly 6,000 migrants across the Rio Grande Valley this week.
""I've been in situations where there is no way to control something, whether it's a health problem, or otherwise, and you really feel helpless and overwhelmed and you're at your wits' ends,"" said Martinez. ""Here, because of the community coming together, we lift each other's heart to meet the occasion.""
Meanwhile, CBP announced Thursday that construction of 13 miles of new border wall in the Rio Grande Valley will begin this month. Copyright 2019 Texas Public Radio. To see more, visit Texas Public Radio . © 2019 Georgia Public Broadcasting"

Big Wild Bottles His Challenges And Curiosities Into Debut Album,www.gpb.org,Monika Evstatieva,04-07-2019,2019,4,http://www.gpb.org/post/big-wild-bottles-his-challenges-and-curiosities-debut-album,"By Monika Evstatieva • 2 hours ago Big Wild's debut album Superdream is out now. Little Green Eyes / Courtesy of the artist Listen Listening... /
Jackson Stell began his music career making hip-hop beats. As a producer, he had gone by J Beatz. Then some years ago, he felt stuck and had a change of heart. He decided to make a different type of music and he decided he would try his hand at singing on his tracks. Now, this beatsmith-turned-vocalist is known as Big Wild and says singing and writing lyrics enabled him to make music that feels true to himself.
Superdream, the debut album of Big Wild, is a collection of funky, electronic dance jams that features his own voice for the first time. Stell says his singing still comes as a surprise to his own his family members.
""They are still trying to wrap their heads around the fact that I am singing, because growing up I never sang,"" Stell explains. ""I, for the most part, have been a really quiet person, but especially with music, I was all about production.""
Stell was inspired to change his musical course and stage moniker to Big Wild about five years ago when the artist visited California. ""It was kind of at a moment in my life where I was making a big change and I just wanted to embody that spirit of adventurousness of being curious,"" he says. YouTube
This switch paid off. His collaboration with Tove Styrke, "" Aftergold "" became a hit. In 2017, Stell released his first EP, Invincible, gaining millions of plays. The musician carried that adventurous spirit into Superdream, a collection of songs deeply rooted in his life. Stell wrote the song ""Maker"" after receiving a thyroid cancer diagnosis five years ago, going through multiple surgeries and gaining a whole new perspective on what music he wanted to make.
""It was important for me to write about struggles and challenges I've had, but offer or put a positive focus on it,"" Stell says.

Olivia Sun/NPR Listening... /
During a recent break in the action, a dance squad stormed the court for the Washington Wizards. Donning bright red, white and sparkly blue outfits, they spun, they shimmied, they even did some light twerking. They looked like any dance team a fan might expect to see at an NBA game, except for one difference: They were all over the age of 50. Wizdom dancer Christopher Johnson, 53, rehearses while the rest of the team gets ready in locker rooms before their second-to-last performance of the season. Johnson is a special needs educator when he's not dancing, and says that music and dance has played an integral role in his life. Olivia Sun/NPR
The ""Wizdom"" dance team, as the squad is called, first took the court for the Wizards in November and has performed at several home gamesever since. The 19 women and one man who make up the squad range in age from 50 to 76, and they include former NFL cheerleaders, a dentist, several grandmothers and a breast cancer survivor.
""We are part of what I like to call the 'Fame,' 'Flashdance' and 'Let's Get Physical' generation,"" says Wizdom dancer Cindy Hardeman, 60. ""We're just taking it into our elder years,"" she says, later adding ""If we were to top it in order of why we do it, I'd say fun, fun and fun."" Wizdom dancers rehearse backstage before a performance at the Capitol One Arena. Olivia Sun/NPR
With contagious enthusiasm, team members are almost always dancing: in the locker room, walking to practice, lining up to perform.
""They're very well-rehearsed, perform with a lot of energy, charisma, style, and are just entertaining to watch,"" says the team's choreographer, Derric Whitfield.

More than 50 people tried out for the Wizdom — a rigorous audition process that was documented by the team's sponsor, the AARP. With their debut in November, they became one of at least a dozen other squads for dancers who are 50 or older in the NBA. By the time the season is over, Whitfield says, the team will have learned and performed seven routines in total. More than 50 people tried out for the Wizdom.

Some were looking for a way to get more exercise or were talked into it by their grandchildren. Wizdom members enter the floor of the Capitol One Arena. Olivia Sun/NPR
For others, the team has helped them to overcome hardships.

The team is extremely dedicated, Whitfield says. One member, for example, performed right after a prolonged nose bleed. Some have chronic health conditions, but train together outside of the team's official weekly practices.
""To our surprise we are able to do things we didn't think we could do,"" says Christopher Johnson, 53, the one male member of the team.

Salvador Dalí Meets The Marx Brothers In 'Giraffes On Horseback Salad',www.gpb.org,Peter Breslow,04-07-2019,2019,4,http://www.gpb.org/post/salvador-dal-meets-marx-brothers-giraffes-horseback-salad,"By Peter Breslow • 3 hours ago Salvador Dalí­'s idea for a Marx Brothers movie was never made — but it's been resurrected as a graphic novel. Quirk Books Listening... /
This is a story about something that didn't happen. A movie that was never made. It was supposed to be a collaboration between the Surrealist artist Salvador Dalí and the Marx Brothers. YouTube
Dalí was the toast of the town in 1970 when he appeared on the Dick Cavett TV show. Elegantly dressed in a burgundy velvet sport coat and sparkly vest, this titan of the surrealist movement strode on stage with a gold handled cane in his right hand — and on his left, a live anteater on a leash, which he promptly dumped in the lap of another guest, the actress Lillian Gish. When Gish asked him if his work had a message for people, he shot back ""No message."" ""Could you invent one?"" pleaded Cavett.
Back in 1937, Dalí was much less famous when he showed up at MGM studios with his buddy Harpo Marx to pitch a movie treatment. The Marx Brothers, on the other hand, were at the height of their popularity, thanks to their hijinks in films like Duck Soup , A Night at the Opera and Animal Crackers .
But studio head Louis B. Mayer didn't particularly like the Marx Brothers or know what to make of Salvador Dalí, and so he killed the project the artist had titled Giraffes on Horseback Salad . Now, writer Josh Frank has turned that somewhat incomprehensible screenplay into a graphic novel. ""It was crazy surreal,"" he says, ""and totally not digestible, and Groucho said quote-unquote 'it wouldn't play.'""
And so that screenplay slipped into the realm of legendary lost treasures — that is, until Frank got wind of it, tracked it down at a museum in France, and recruited a team to help him put it together. The team included Spanish illustrator Manuela Pertega and comedian Tim Heidecker, who helped come up with gags because Dalí's production notes just said, ""insert Marx Brothers routine here."" Frank says the collaboration worked. ""Next thing you know, I'm creating a new piece of Marx Brothers art for the world, and it's a dream come true.""
But we've put the cart before the giraffe here. Let's back up. First, what's with that name? Frank hasn't a clue. ""Asking me what Giraffes on Horseback Salad means is asking me, 'lobsterphone,' you know?"" he laughs. ""However, what I've always thought, ever since I first heard that name, is that to me it's the perfect name for a Marx Brothers movie written by Salvador Dalí. Because it has that — A Night at the Opera , A Day at the Races , Giraffes on Horseback Salad . It works somehow.""
Next, the plot — such as it is. A businessman named Jimmy finds his well ordered upper-crust life turned inside out when he meets the Surrealist Woman. She's a stunning shape-shifter who discombobulates the world around her. Eventually she's arrested for her surrealist crimes and winds up in court where the mayhem of the Marx Brothers ultimately liberates her. These moments are depicted in the book as the trippiest of swirling LSD experiences. The adventures of the Surrealist Woman. Quirk Books
And finally, just how did Salvador Dalí end up teaming up with the Marx Brothers in the first place? ""When he first saw a Marx Brothers movie, it put him in a trance, because he felt he was watching the human embodiment of surrealism in its purest form,"" Frank says. ""All of the Marx Brothers, but specifically Harpo, because Harpo was unbridled, almost animalistic, so he loved Harpo.""
Harpo, who never spoke on screen, was probably the zaniest member of the family, known for playing the harp and pulling items from under his trench coat — like 300 knives or a hot cup of coffee or a blowtorch — and of course, honking his horn. He was in Paris in 1936 on a publicity tour for A Night at the Opera when he met Dalí. Even though they didn't have a language in common, the pair clicked, and Dalí decided to incorporate the Marx Brothers into the movie treatment he was working on. Harpo Marx with the surrealist harp sent to him by Salvador Dalí. Marx Family
Harpo's son Bill Marx remembers being maybe 7 or 8 when he came across a Xerox copy of Giraffes . ""And I started reading it, and I really couldn't make heads or tails of it,"" he says. Bill, a musician and composer, was too young to remember when Dalí came to the States to paint his dad and pitch his film. But there were telltale signs of the friendship — like the Dalí pen and ink sketches hanging in his bedroom growing up. There were also stories about the full-sized surrealist harp Dalí had sent to Harpo. It came wrapped in cellophane, with the harp frame dripping forks and spoons and barbed wire replacing the strings. But Bill Marx says they didn't have the instrument very long. ""My mother, who was very practical, she said I'm sorry, I can't look at this anymore, and she threw it in the garbage."" Just imagine if there was some lucky dumpster diver that day.
Harpo was also an accomplished painter, producing some 300 works, and Dalí sat for him during his California trip. Bill Marx say his dad's time with the artist may have been brief, but it's effect on both of men was long lasting. Author Josh Frank agrees. ""So this whole meeting of these two strange and wonderful minds, I really felt even though it was a short amount of time they were together that they profoundly affected each other because Harpo went on to continue painting and take it even more seriously.""
And, says Frank, Dalí was also left inspired — but ultimately unfulfilled too. ""This short time he had with Harpo was, I feel like, a really great lost moment that created a work of art that until now has not really been able to be seen.""
Dalí envisioned a huge Hollywood production for Giraffes on Horseback Salad , complete with music by Cole Porter. While the project never did get the green light, there is a now a soundtrack to go along with the graphic novel — including music, complete with a faux Groucho. And so just maybe, up in some dreamy surrealist heaven, the real Groucho — along with Harpo, Chico and Salvador Dalí — is smiling down. Copyright 2019 NPR.

A Math Teacher's Life Summed Up By The Gifted Students He Mentored,www.gpb.org,Joe Palca,04-07-2019,2019,4,http://www.gpb.org/post/math-teachers-life-summed-gifted-students-he-mentored,"By Joe Palca • 2 hours ago George Berzsenyi mentored thousands of high school students in mathematics. Sara Stathas for NPR
George Berzsenyi is a retired math professor living in Milwaukee County. Most people have never heard of him.
But Berzsenyi has had a remarkable impact on American science and mathematics. He has mentored thousands of high school students, including some who became among the best mathematicians and scientists in the country.
I learned about Berzsenyi from a chance conversation with a scientist named Vamsi Mootha .
In the late 1980s, when Mootha was in high school in Beaumont, Texas, he won a science fair. A few days later, a letter arrived in the mail.
""It said, 'Dear Vamsi, Congratulations on winning the Houston Science Fair , this is quite the accomplishment,' "" Mootha recalls.
""But then when I started reading the next paragraph, I felt a sinking feeling in my stomach,"" Mootha says.
The letter went on to say that the math problem young Vamsi solved to win the fair had been solved hundreds of years earlier.
""Of course, the letter went on, 'You can't be expected to know this because you're only a sophomore in high school, and perhaps you haven't had the appropriate mentorship ... If you're interested in solving original problems, why don't you write back to me.' ""
The letter was signed ""George Berzsenyi."" At the time, Berzsenyi was a math professor at Lamar University in Beaumont.
Mootha says the letter upset him because he thought he had discovered something new.
But then he became intrigued. ""I said, 'You know what, I'm going to take him up on his offer and write back to him.' ""
They got together and the older mathematician and the young prodigy hit it off. Berzsenyi would give Mootha those original problems to solve ... and an appreciation for mathematics.
""He also sort of instilled in me a love for mathematics and a love for sort of elegant mathematics that makes sense,"" Mootha says
Eventually Mootha headed off to Stanford University, then Harvard medical school where he works today.
A half-dozen or so years ago, Mootha found out he had a lot of company in being mentored by George Berzsenyi.
""I share an office with somebody named Joel Hirschhorn ,"" Mootha tells me. Hirschhorn is a geneticist at Harvard and the Broad Institute. Mootha and Hirschhorn were trying to solve a math problem related to their work.
""Joel is up at the board, he's drawing out some equations,"" Mootha recalls. ""After we worked on the problem, we're just reminiscing about our high school days in mathematics.
""So I start to tell Joel about how I got this letter after winning a science fair,"" Mootha says, ""and before I could actually finish that sentence, he actually asked me, 'Wait. Did that letter come from somebody named George Berzsenyi?' And I said, 'Yes, how do you know?' And he said, 'I used to communicate with George Berzsenyi also.' ""
Hirschhorn would send in solutions to problems in a math newsletter Berzsenyi edited.
The coincidence was astonishing, and then it happened again.
Two weeks later, Mootha is telling Sebastian Seung this story. Seung is a neuroscientist who at the time was at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Before he can finish the story, Mootha says, ""Sebastian interrupts me and says, 'Wait, was that George Berzsenyi?' and I said, 'Yes, how do you know?' ""
Mootha soon found that Berzsenyi has affected the lives of many top scientists and mathematicians.
At this point, I knew I had to meet Berzsenyi. So I went to meet him at his house in Milwaukee County where he lives with his wife, Kay.
Berzsenyi is 80 now. He was born in Hungary. In high school, he fell in love with mathematics. Hungary punches above its weight in the subject. The country has produced many famous mathematicians.
Berzsenyi came to America and got a doctorate in mathematics.
He joined the math faculty at Lamar in Beaumont, where he started mentoring talented high school math students.
He created a math magazine patterned on KöMaL , which he had read in Hungary while in high school. The magazine only existed for a few years. He's hoping someday someone will revive it.
There were tricky math problems in the magazine. When students sent in solutions, he would send back comments.
He was surprised how willing the students were to work with him. He realized he was filling an unmet need. Berzsenyi said most high schools don't have the expertise to help these bright math students, and professional mathematicians by and large can't be bothered.
Berzsenyi loved watching young people's math talents grow. Berzsenyi took a busload of students, including Jimmy Wilson and Ferrell Wheeler, to the American Regions Mathematics League in Texas in 1981 and 1982. Courtesy of George Berzsenyi
""In spite of their youth, I considered them mathematically supremely mature and treated them in such fashion ... I really admired them,"" he says.
Over the years, Berzsenyi worked with thousands of kids. He didn't expect all of them to become mathematicians. In addition to math, Berzsenyi's protégés have gone on to biology, business and even law.

""I first met Dr. Berzsenyi through the young scholars programs in 1995,"" says Yvonne Lai , an assistant math professor the University of Nebraska, Lincoln. She says Berzsenyi created the program as kind of a summer math camp for high school students.
As the camp was coming to an end, Lai recalls, ""He assigned us a group of 10 math competition-style problems that we could hand in as a final assignment in 10 years.""
The group stayed in touch using a mailing list. And about a decade later, ""somebody wrote the mailing list and said, 'It's been 10 years, we have a problem set due,' "" Lai says with a laugh.
An assignment due 10 years later is just the kind of clever idea George Berzsenyi used to keep students engaged in math.
Berzsenyi is proud of what his math protégés have accomplished. Ferrell Wheeler does cryptography work for the National Security Agency. Kiran Kedlaya works on number theory at the University of California, San Diego. Noam Elkies became a tenured math faculty member at Harvard when he was just 26 years old.
The protégés are uniformly grateful for Berzsenyi's attention.
It is ""through programs that George Berzsenyi developed that I think I got the courage to become a math major,"" says Lai.
""His influence on me is hard to describe,"" says Wheeler. ""He was like a second father to me. And he helped me immensely.""
""It's hard to find somebody who is that passionate about discovering the future generation of talent in any field, but particularly in mathematics,"" says Kedlaya.
Of all the students Berzsenyi told me about in the hours we spoke, one stood out: Jimmy Wilson. ""In the long run, Jimmy was probably my major discovery,"" Berzsenyi says.
Wilson almost fell through the cracks. When he was a high school freshman, Wilson took part in a math competition. Berzsenyi happened to look over the shoulder of the judge scoring Wilson's solution to one of the tough problems in the competition.
""The solution he gave to the problem was a perfect solution,"" Berzsenyi says. ""Somehow, the person who was grading the solution didn't recognize that it actually solved the problem, and very elegantly.""
So Berzsenyi overruled the first judge and gave Wilson a top score. Jimmy Wilson chats with mathematician Nura Turner at the United States of American Mathematical Olympiad in 1978. Courtesy of George Berzsenyi
Later in high school, Berzseny took Wilson and a bunch of other students to a math competition on the East Coast.
The concluding event at the competition was a game called Buzz.
""The kid never heard of this before. I never heard of it before,"" Berzsenyi says.
It's a counting game. Students stand in a circle and take turns counting, but there are complex rules where you replace numbers with words like ""buzz,"" ""bang"" or ""whack."" Say the wrong word and you're out. It's fiendishly hard to keep all the rules straight, especially as the count reaches into the hundreds.
Eventually, there were just two students left: the previous year's champion and Wilson.
""It was just unbelievable to watch,"" Berzsenyi recalls. ""Very methodically, Jimmy just succeeded where the other kid didn't.""
For all his natural aptitude for math, at first Wilson didn't do well in college. He dropped out of Texas A&M. Berzsenyi says it was because Wilson hadn't really learned how to study.
""At that time, I didn't recognize some of the things I should have been doing,"" he says. ""I still feel bad about it.""
""I don't think he needs to feel that way at all,"" says Jimmy Wilson. Today he goes by Jim Wilson. He now has his college degree. He still lives in Beaumont, Texas. He has worked as an educator in the local school system for most of his adult life.
He's proud of what he did at that East Coast math competition, proud of his math skills. He's especially proud of the day George Berzsenyi gave him a Rubik's Cube.
""If you can solve it, you can keep it,"" Wilson recalls Berzsenyi saying.
It took him a couple days, but solve it he did.
Wilson recalled Berzsenyi telling him how impressed he was, and then. "" 'Oh by the way, I think you're the first person in the country to solve it,' "" Wilson says. The cube Berzsenyi gave Wilson was one he had brought back from Hungary where the Rubik's Cube was invented. The U.S. version had yet to go on the market — it did so in 1980.
It's true Wilson didn't achieve the kind of academic fame or financial success that some of Berzsenyi's other students did.
""I could look back with some regrets,"" Wilson says. But he's also found great fulfillment in helping the students he has taught over the years to find the joy in math.
""To this day, as I reach out to help students to improve their skills, it's because of that relationship that started when I was in high school with Dr. Berzsenyi,"" Wilson says. Copyright 2019 NPR.

Artisanal Food Shop Helps Kosovo War-Rape Survivors Earn Income — And Heal,www.gpb.org,Valerie Plesch,04-07-2019,2019,4,http://www.gpb.org/post/artisanal-food-shop-helps-kosovo-war-rape-survivors-earn-income-and-heal,"Artisanal Food Shop Helps Kosovo War-Rape Survivors Earn Income — And Heal By Valerie Plesch • 2 hours ago Left: M., a survivor of sexual violence during the Kosovo war, holds a jar of red pepper spread that she prepared at her home to sell at a new artisanal food shop in Gjakova, in western Kosovo. Working with food is a form of therapy for M. Right: B., also a survivor, prepares fresh clotted cream from her home in a village in western Kosovo. Valerie Plesch / for NPR
Every morning, B. wakes up at dawn to begin her day in a rural farming village in western Kosovo. She starts the fire, bakes fresh bread for the home, feeds her cow, then tends to her homemade dairy products that she prepares from a small room.
""I'm restless, I have to do something,"" B., 51, says. ""I feel like my brain is more quiet when I do this in my own house.""
Later in the day, she packages her different types of fresh cheese and yogurt and gets them ready to be picked up and sold at a new shop in Gjakova — a bustling city around 30 minutes away from her home.
B. is one of the estimated 20,000 women and men who were raped and tortured by Serbian police and the Yugoslav army during the 1998-1999 Kosovo war against Serbia. The exact number is difficult to determine, given the sensitivities surrounding the topic of wartime rape in this nation of 1.8 million people. In Kosovo's conservative and traditional society, wartime rape victims continue to be stigmatized, shamed and isolated not only by society, but also by their families, from whom many survivors have kept the rape a secret. That's why survivors are not using their names in this story.
""In general, in cases of sexual violence, the shame and guilt is unfortunately usually put on the victim and not on the perpetrator. In Kosovo, the case is the same,"" says Rozafa Kelmendi, project manager with the Women, Peace and Security sector at U.N. Women in Kosovo. She notes that it was only in 2008 that the U.N. Security Council passed a resolution condemning sexual violence as a tool of war.
""So if it took this long for the [United Nations] to recognize this as a crime, then it takes much longer for the society to see conflicted-related sexual violence as a weapon of war and a crime committed on the victims — and not something that should be considered as a [source of] shame,"" Kelmendi says.
What's more, many survivors have had a hard time earning an income because of the trauma they suffered after the war and the lack of job opportunities in Kosovo. But now, 20 years after the end of the conflict, a new store in Kosovo aims to change that.
Medica Gjakova, one of four NGOs in Kosovo working with survivors of sexual violence, opened an artisanal food shop last December, with the help of theGerman Society for International Cooperation (GIZ) and the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ), some of the main international donors involved in supporting NGOs in Kosovo. A new artisanal food shop in Gjakova, in western Kosovo, sells organic products sourced from the homes of survivors of sexual violence during the war. Valerie Plesch / for NPR
The shop sells a variety of organic products sourced from around two dozen survivors' farms and homes in surrounding villages. Items include different types of fresh cheese, creamy yogurt, three varieties of honey, apple, apricot, raspberry and blackberry jams, bright red pepper spreads, shelled walnuts and eggs. The shop is part of Medica Gjakova's economic empowerment project, which helps survivors become entrepreneurs and earn an income – in some cases, for the first time in their lives.
It is the first shop of its kind in Kosovo and is a big step towards helpingthese women to lead more independent lives from the comfort and safety of their homes, which makes it more convenient for them to work. Medica Gjakova is in the process of registering the shop as a social enterprise and is training other survivors on entrepreneurship and developing their catering and culinary skills.
""We saw that economic empowerment is very important for the women because they are much more self-confident. And when it comes to the family, they are able to bring some money to the family and [thus] they are much stronger within the family,"" says Mirlinda Sada, executive director of NGO Medica Gjakova. ""We are trying to prepare the women to be the leaders of these enterprises,"" Sada says.
The ancient city of Gjakova was nearly destroyed during the war. Many war crimes took place in this city and surrounding villages, especially during the 78-day NATO bombing campaign in 1999. That campaign eventually ended the war and drove the forces of former Serbian president Slobodan Milosevic out of Kosovo.
The artisanal shop is located on a busy street in the city center. The window display shows an assortment of neatly arranged fresh farm eggs, walnuts, pumpkins and apples. Since its opening, the store has had to constantly restock its supply of spicy pickled vegetables, nuts and dairy products, thanks to demand from customers who come here looking for fresh, homemade traditional food.
""People are writing [messages] to Medica, asking where they can buy these products and [saying] that they are really good,"" Sada says.
Medica Gjakova — the NGO — has provided counseling to approximately 400 survivors of sexual violence since the end of the war. Though many survivors continue to receive treatment and aren't working, others feel ready to move forward with their lives.
""This is very important because after they were empowered [through counseling and other services], they needed something more,"" Sada says. ""Having a job and working is a kind of therapy."" This is the only cow belonging to B., a survivor of sexual violence during the Kosovo war. She uses its milk to produce a variety of dairy products sold at a new a shop opened by Medica Gjakova, an NGO working with survivors. Valerie Plesch / for NPR
This is especially true for survivors like M.
""[Working with food] helps me with my peace and with my health,"" says M. from her home in a rural village near Gjakova, where heavy fighting took place during the war. ""Time goes by and I forget the past.""
M. now spends her days listening to music from a small radio in her work space outside her home, still on her family compound. There, she makesjars of homemade ajvar , a traditional Balkan red pepper spread, and tangy pickled vegetables known as torshi , which are popular accompaniments to Persian, Middle Eastern and Balkan dishes. ""This is where I feel the best,"" M., 57, says about her work space.
""I receive a lot of compliments from my clients, which is satisfying,"" M. says about her products. ""I gain pleasure from that — when I feel like I can do good for others, too. At the same time, my finances are better. I've helped my children a lot with their education. And I help my husband and the family.""
She earns around $275 per month – nearly equivalent to the average salary earned by women in Kosovo, according to Amnesty International .
Medica Gjakova is planning on opening one more shop in Pristina, Kosovo's capital, at the end of April, as well as an online shop.
""So this is really the cherry on the cake, because we now know the women really are able to ... have a profit, earn money, and to be stronger and to have the voice in the family,"" Sada says. Copyright 2019 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org. © 2019 Georgia Public Broadcasting"
Economic Ripples: Hospital Closure Hurts A Town's Ability To Attract Retirees,www.gpb.org,Blake Farmer,04-07-2019,2019,4,http://www.gpb.org/post/economic-ripples-hospital-closure-hurts-towns-ability-attract-retirees,"/ Originally published on April 7, 2019 8:05 am
When a rural community loses its hospital, health care becomes harder to come by in an instant. But a hospital closure also shocks a small town's economy. It shuts down one of its largest employers. It scares off heavy industry that needs an emergency room nearby. And in one Tennessee town, a lost hospital means lost hope of attracting more retirees.
Seniors, and their retirement accounts, have been viewed as potential saviors for many rural economies trying to make up for lost jobs. But the epidemic of rural hospital closures is threatening those dreams in places like Celina, Tenn.. The town of 1,500, whose 25-bed hospital closed March 1, has been trying to position itself as a retiree destination.
""I'd say, look elsewhere,"" says Susan Scovel, a Seattle transplant who came with her husband in 2015.
Scovel's despondence is especially noteworthy given that she leads the local chamber of commerce effort to attract retirees like herself. She considers the wooded hills and secluded lake to hold comparable scenic beauty to the Washington coast — with dramatically lower costs of living; she and a small committee plan getaway weekends for prospects to visit.
When she first toured the region before moving in 2015, Scovel and her husband, who had Parkinson's, made sure to scope out the hospital, on a hill overlooking the sleepy town square. And she's rushed to the hospital four times since he died in 2017.
""I have very high blood pressure, and they're able to do the IVs to get it down,"" Scovel says. ""This is an anxiety thing since my husband died. So now — I don't know.""
She says she can't in good conscience advise a senior with health problems to come join her in Celina. Susan Bailey has lived most of her life in Celina and started her nursing career at Cumberland River Hospital. She now worries that its closure will drive away the town's remaining physicians. Blake Farmer/WPLN
The closure adds delays when seconds count
Celina's Cumberland River Hospital had been on life support for years, operated by the city-owned medical center an hour away in Cookeville, which decided in late January to cut its losses after trying to find a buyer. Cookeville Regional Medical Center explains that the facility faced the grim reality for many rural providers.
""Unfortunately, many rural hospitals across the country are having a difficult time and facing the same challenges, like declining reimbursements and lower patient volumes, that Cumberland River Hospital has experienced,"" CEO Paul Korth said in a written statement.
Celina became the 11th rural hospital in Tennessee to close in recent years — more than in any state but Texas. Both states have refused to expand Medicaid in a way that covers more of the working poor. Even some Republicans now say the decision to not expand Medicaid has added to the struggles of rural health care providers.
The closest hospital is now 18 miles away. That adds another 30 minutes through mountain roads for those who need an X-ray or blood work. For those in the back of an ambulance, that bit of time could make the difference between life or death. Staff members posted photos and other memorabilia in the halls — reminders of happier times — in the weeks before its closure. Blake Farmer/WPLN
""We have the capability of doing a lot of advanced life support, but we're not a hospital,"" says emergency management director Natalie Boone.
The area is already limited in its ambulance service, withtwo of its four trucks out of service.
Once a crew is dispatched, Boone says, it's committed to that call. Adding an hour to the turnaround time means someone else could likely call with an emergency and be told — essentially — to wait in line.
""What happens when you have that patient that doesn't have that extra time?"" Boone asks. ""I can think of at least a minimum of two patients [in the last month] that did not have that time.""
Residents are bracing for cascading effects. Susan Bailey hasn't retired yet, but she's close. She's spent nearly 40 years as a registered nurse, including her early career at Cumberland River.
""People say, 'You probably just need to move or find another place to go,' "" she says. Closure of the hospital meant 147 nurses, aides and clerical staff had to find new jobs. The hospital was the town's second-largest employer, after the local school system. Blake Farmer/WPLN
Bailey and others are concerned that losing the hospital will soon mean losing the only three physicians in town. The doctors say they plan to keep their practices going, but for how long? And what about when they retire?
""That's a big problem,"" Bailey says. ""The doctors aren't going to want to come in and open an office and have to drive 20 or 30 minutes to see their patients every single day.""
Closure of the hospital means 147 nurses, aides and clerical staff have to find new jobs. Some employees come to tears at the prospect of having to find work outside the county and are deeply sad that their hometown is losing one of its largest employers — second only to the local school system.
Dr. John McMichen is an emergency physician who would travel to Celina to work weekends at the ER and give the local doctors a break.
""I thought of Celina as maybe the Andy Griffith Show of health care,"" he says.
McMichen, who also worked at the now shuttered Copper Basin Medical Center , on the other side of the state, says people at Cumberland River knew just about anyone who would walk through the door. That's why it was attractive to retirees.
""It reminded me of a time long ago that has seemingly passed. I can't say that it will ever come back,"" he says. ""I have hopes that there's still some hope for small hospitals in that type of community. But I think the chances are becoming less of those community hospitals surviving."" Copyright 2019 WPLN.

Monsters Imaginary And Real Haunt The Caves Of 'The Luminous Dead',www.gpb.org,Jason Sheehan,04-07-2019,2019,4,http://www.gpb.org/post/monsters-imaginary-and-real-haunt-caves-luminous-dead,"By Jason Sheehan • 4 hours ago
The astronaut alone in their capsule. The explorer stranded far from home. The one who wakes to the flickering light and failing systems of their underground bunker. The lonely survivor in a ruined world — Last Man Alive.
Science fiction loves its stripped-down character list like high fantasy does the crowded dramatis personae. It has a streak of rugged individualism that's been around since the good old days, a vestige of its roots in the westerns, Golden Age sci-fi libertarianism and after-the-bomb freak-outs. To really squirm into someone's head, sci-fi says, you gotta get 'em alone against the world. Anything else is just opera.
Caitlin Starling gets that. She understands the classical strength of the single narrator, the vicious focus of third person, non-omniscient objectivity, the claustrophobic potential of never, ever (almost ever) being able to escape the confines of one person's head.
Of Gyre Price's head, inside her helmet, miles below the surface of a planet, stalked by monsters.
That's The Luminous Dead in brief. It is a haunted cave story. A psychological nightmare yarn spun between just two characters. There's Gyre, the young caver who desperately lied her way into a risky, high-paying job exploring an underground system, and there's Em, her handler, the voice in her ear, her only connection to the outside world. Thus, it is a universe contained completely within the heads Gyre and Em.
Trouble is, Em is crazy.
Trouble is, so is Gyre.
Trouble is, the monsters — some of them, anyway — are very real.
It's tough to know here how much more I should tell you, because the entire architecture of the story hangs on the slow-burn paranoia and the fraying personal connection between Gyre and Em. I can say that the job isn't what Gyre expects it to be. And I can say that she was ridiculously, admittedly naïve to begin with — not really asking any questions, not even requesting a briefing before the book drops her into the initial descent — because she was so worried about her lie being found out. And I can certainly say that even with just two characters tangled up at the core of this book, Gyre isn't the only liar here. Em has secrets, too. She's her own special kind of monster — manipulative, damaged, terrible, but also deeply, deeply human. They both are. The Luminous Dead is too meticulously twisted to let anyone simply be evil without cause, without depth.
And that, actually, is the best thing about these kind of one-man (or, in this case, two-woman) shows. Like Ripley in Alien , like Mark Watney in The Martian , it's the lack of distractions — like multiple viewpoints, a large cast, a pushy narrator — that allows you to slip completely into one skin and wear it around for a while. It allows you to inhabit Gyre's world completely, without interruption and without ... relief.
Because the world we're offered isn't nice. Or comfortable. Or pleasant in almost any way. It's the kind of story that can make a single breath of cool air seem like a banquet and a massage; a sip of recycled urine the most luxurious thing imaginable. It is a claustrophobic story (because cave), a dark and blank and drippy one (because cave). Worse, it is a story about madness and loneliness and claustrophobia and isolation made even colder by the smart, awful, perfect application of technology.
See, Gyre spends her entire time locked in a special protective suit and helmet. Her meals are all nutritive paste delivered through a shunt directly into her stomach. Her air is filtered and recycled. She can't touch her face or scrub her fingers through her hair. She can't feel anything but aching muscles and exhaustion, but her suit can deliver drugs directly into her bloodstream to help. It can be operated remotely by Em if necessary. And everything Gyre sees is filtered through her heads-up display, overlaid with radar and sonar and image amplification, all of which is controlled by Em. It is a torturous book. Horrifying in small, cutting, personal ways, and in the more classic scare-in-a-dark-room way. But there's an iron rod of panicked strength that runs through the middle of it. -
Em, who may not have Gyre's best interests at heart. Who may not want her to see certain things. Who has profited by the poverty and desperation of this planet's population as the mines fail and jobs become more and more scarce. Who has sent other cavers down this hole before, not all of whom came back.
Em, who is crazy. A monster. A liar.
But also the only thing keeping Gyre alive.
So yes, The Luminous Dead is a book about spelunking and ghosts and the ways we are haunted by the dead and the missing. There are sequences about diving through flooded, silt-blind sumps that will raise every hair on your neck, and a long stretch (arguably too long) in the middle where even the mercy of having two characters for company becomes winnowed down to just one as Gyre, in a fit, cuts her communications with the surface.
It is a torturous book. Horrifying in small, cutting, personal ways, and in the more classic scare-in-a-dark-room way. But there's an iron rod of panicked strength that runs through the middle of it. A will to survive that is palpable. And by the time it is winding toward its conclusion, all the lies, the nightmares and the psychological games fall away and The Luminous Dead simply becomes a bloody race to the surface.
There's no forgiveness waiting there. No absolution. Only escape from the monsters down in the cave and — maybe — the ones that Gyre and Em brought down with them, too.

But Canada didn't have to defend Canadian Arctic territories when those territories were still frozen, did it? Global warming has opened up new areas for oil and gas exploration and shipping that once were covered by ice. Sure we did. Starting in WWII and continuing throughout the Cold War we and our senior American partners militarised the arctic and constructed concentric belts of early warning, detection and surveillance bases in the arctic and the near-north of Canada. We even deployed for a time nuclear-tipped interceptor missiles bought from the USA and renamed them the Beaumark missile system. We built airforce bases and oddly post offices to defend Canadian sovereignty in the arctic and we militarised First Nations and Inuit peoples by arming them using the Canadian Ranger programme. Ice would not stop Soviet missiles and aircraft attacking North America. Cheers."

Results 1 to 5 of 5 Government soldiers near Marynka, eastern Ukraine prepare to count election votes. 4/4/19 OTTAWA  After serving as an official election monitor in Ukraine for the first round of that countrys presidential election, former Liberal foreign minister Lloyd Axworthy is warning Canadians will be vulnerable to Russian disinformation during the federal contest scheduled for this October. Theres some lessons to learn for Canadians. I think Ukraines on the front line, and theres a wake-up call that anybodys election, including ours in six months, could be altered, disrupted or problems could be created in terms of disinformation if youre not very watchful about it, he said in an interview with the National Post on Thursday. I cant predict what would happen here. I just know that were vulnerable. Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland and Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan recently announced they were extending a training mission in Ukraine through 2022. About 200 Canadian troops are stationed in the countrys west assisting its military as conflict with Russia-backed separatists continues in eastern Ukraine. Axworthy, who served in the cabinets of Jean Chrétien and Pierre Trudeau and currently chairs the World Refugee Council, led a group of more than a hundred Canadian election observers funded by Global Affairs Canada to meet with Ukrainian officials and report on the integrity of its proceedings this week. Even against the odds of Russian interference and the conflicts on the east side and so on, they did a very effective job and there werent a lot of disruptions, he said. There were small glitches but nothing affected the outcome. Axworthy said Canada could ramp up its participation not only in election observation but in diplomatic efforts writ large. He acknowledged that after cutbacks under the previous Conservative government, the current Liberals havent fleshed their foreign department back out, despite their famous claim that Canada is back. I think the government needs to put more investment in these sorts of things. I dont mean massive sums like they did on infrastructure. But we really have to maintain a very active and effective diplomatic network around the world, he said. Most of the international election monitors (2,500+) will remain in Ukraine for the April 21, runoff election. Russia is meddling/interfering in elections in virtually every nation with a free democratic system.  My father was born in a very wonderful place in Germany.

Amnesty International 4/1/19 Two years after the violent gay purge in Chechnya, Russian authorities have failed to provide justice for the victims, Amnesty International said today. In a crackdown revealed in 2017, dozens of men were abducted, tortured and killed for their real or perceived sexual orientation. To date, not one person has yet been held accountable for these crimes. The Russian authorities have shown themselves to be complicit in heinous crimes committed in Chechnya against people believed to be gay or lesbian, said Marie Struthers, Amnesty Internationals Director for Eastern Europe and Central Asia. Two years after reports of a gay purge sent shockwaves worldwide, its clear that the perpetrators have gone unpunished because of state-sponsored homophobia and impunity for human rights violations in Chechnya. Meanwhile, authorities have also failed to provide effective protection to LGBTI rights defender Igor Kochetkov, the leading figure in the public investigation of the violent crackdown, who has recently received death threats. On 29 January this year, a video containing insults and a death threat directed at Igor Kochetkov was widely distributed across social networks. After Igor Kochetkov presented a formal complaint against the author of this video, the police merely suggested that next time the human rights defender should call an emergency number. The shocking disregard to human lives and dignity has reached a new low as the authorities have neglected to carry out a thorough investigation into death threats sent to Russian LGBTI Networks Executive Director Igor Kochetkov. In April 2017, the newspaper Novaya Gazeta exposed a horrifying crackdown in Chechnya in which dozens of men were abducted, tortured and killed. The failure of the Russian state to provide justice for these victims unleashed another wave of homophobic crimes in Chechnya in 2018. By January 2019, at least two people were believed to have been tortured to death in this crackdown. Chechnya is a federal republic of the Russian Federation and is ultimately under Kremlin control.

That's bad news for automakers According to that measure, the two most ""American"" cars are both Hondas  the Odyssey minivan and Ridgeline pickup. Three-quarters of each vehicle's components are made in the United States or Canada. The Honda Civic, Acura MDX, Acura TLX and the Mercedes C-class source 70% from the United States and Canada. The highest-ranked car made by a Detroit automaker is the Chevrolet Corvette, which placed seventh. About two-thirds of its parts and manufacturing are from the United States or Canada.

In 2015, a white supremacist shot and killed nine people at a Bible study at an African-American church in Charleston, S.C. In 2006, a string of arsons at Alabama churches, some predominantly white, some predominantly black, proved to be the work of three college students that officials characterized as a “joke” that had spun out of control. Last month, a black member of a predominantly black congregation, Hopewell Missionary Baptist Church in Greenville, Miss., pleaded guilty to burning his church. The church was spray-painted with the words “Vote Trump” in an effort to make the attack seem politically motivated, a Mississippi official said.

Federal prosecutors announced on Friday that Patrick Carlineo Jr was arrested after placing a threatening call to Omar’s office in Washington DC last month. The FBI said in a criminal complaint Carlineo called Omar a “terrorist” and threatened to shoot her. The bureau also said Carlineo sounded angry during the call but “spelled his name correctly and provided contact information” to a staffer. Carlineo told the FBI he is a patriot, “loves the president and that he hates radical Muslims in our government”, the complaint says. Authorities did not say when Carlineo was arrested.

Ilhan Omar: man arrested after he made death threat – then left contact details | US news | The Guardian Jeff Flake reveals he has received threats from Trump supporters Jeff Flake, the former Republican senator for Arizona and a vocal critic of the Trump administration, has revealed he received a number of threats from supporters of the president before he left office this year. In an interview with the Guardian, Flake described several examples of threatening messages and behaviour made against him and his family that he said were currently being investigated by law enforcement agencies in Arizona and Washington DC.“I would have liked to have done one more term in the Senate, that’s probably all,” Flake said. “But its been at a heavy cost to my family. The sacrifices they’ve been [made to make], what they had to endure …” Donald Trump’s inflammatory rhetoric, both as a candidate for office and as president, has often targeted Flake. The former senator had called for Trump to abandon his bid for the White House in 2016 after the release of a tape showing the reality star bragging about groping women’s genitals. Last week, a man in Chicago pleaded guilty to a federal retaliation charge after leaving a threatening voicemail for an unidentified US senator after the hearings for Trump’s supreme court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. Flake confirmed to the Guardian the message had been left for him after he delayed Kavanaugh’s hearing by pressing for a short FBI investigation into allegations the judge had sexually assaulted a number of women as a teenager. The defendant, 58-year-old James Dean Blevins Jr, said on the voicemail: “I am tired of him interrupting our president, and I am coming down there to take him and his family out,” according to prosecutors.

Venezuelans, already suffering from hyperinflation and widespread shortages of food and medicine, say the crisis has worsened over the past month. That is when crippling nationwide power outages began to leave vast swaths of territory in the dark for days at a time, cutting off water supplies and cell phone service. Guaido, head of the opposition-controlled National Assembly and recognized as Venezuelas legitimate head of state by most Western nations, had called for rallies on Saturday to mark the start of what he has billed as a new wave of definitive protests to oust Maduro. In Caracas, thousands of opposition supporters assembled at a main rally point in the eastern El Marques district. Protesters said their homes had been without water for days and many had taken to drawing it from unsanitary pipes or streams running off the Avila mountain overlooking Caracas. We have to get rid of this usurper, and we cant think about anything else, said Claudia Rueda, a 53-year-old homemaker at the protest. At one point, the crowd chanted, The water has gone, power has gone, and now Maduro whats missing is that you go too. Two massive power outages in recent weeks led Maduros government to cancel school classes and left many businesses shuttered. The resumption of services has been uneven, with cities such as San Cristobal, Valencia and Maracay still reporting intermittent blackouts. While no immediate protest-related violence was reported in Caracas, witnesses reported clashes between protesters and police in the steamy oil hub of Maracaibo. Demonstrators in the city, in the western state of Zulia, told Reuters police had fired rubber bullet rounds and tear gas to disperse them. Im fed up. They hurt me, and though I was frightened, what it makes me most is angry, said Denis Fernandez, a 25-year-old who said he had been injured by a rubber bullet. Fernandez said his daughter had almost died from hepatitis a month ago, as hospitals had no supplies to treat her. Reports say that graves are being opened and looted for jewelry and gold teeth.

Giuliani also hit back at Nadler's claim earlier Sunday that Barr was biased in favor of Trump, saying Nadler “prejudged this case a year ago.”
Nadler, Giuliani said, “was overheard on Amtrak talking about impeachment well before the report came out.”
Giuliani also dismissed claims by members of Mueller’s team that Barr’s four-page summary of Mueller’s findings misrepresented the results of the probe, saying that if the report contained damaging information, Mueller’s team would have provided specific details.
He also suggested sources within Mueller’s office had tipped off CNN about the FBI’s raid on Trump adviser Roger Stone"

Tucker Carlson’s Racist Comments Emerge, Day After Misogynistic Remarks In comments from 2006 to 2011, Carlson said that immigrants should be “hot” or “really smart,” asking if “people [who] come over and pick lettuce” are “going to build, you know, a stronger country 20 years from now?” He tried out the “primitive” insult again, saying that Iraq is populated by “semi-literate primitive monkeys.” The Fox News host also said that he had no respect for Iraqi culture, “where people just don’t use toilet paper or forks.” During the 2008 presidential campaign, he claimed that, “Everybody knows that Barack Obama would still be in the state Senate in Illinois if he were white.” Carlson denied the existence of racism in 2008, in an exchange in which Bubba described white women with “jungle fever” as “mud sharks.” You can listen to the audio here. Carlson also relayed white nationalist rhetoric, including the claim that white men are responsible for “creating civilization.” In 2006, a decade before the election of Donald Trump, Tucker imagined a president who would blame “lunatic Muslims who are behaving like animals” and who would say, “I’m going to kill as many of them as I can if you elect me.” The stupidity on the Right is legion, surpassed only by the ignorance. - Calamity 2019"

Sekulow said, “The Supreme Court has said on multiple occasions that Congressional oversight cannot become law enforcement. The idea that the real reason that the Congress and Chairman Neal has asked for the documents is because they want to know if the IRS is doing its job auditing the president. Well, they could ask the IRS what job are they doing? What are the audit procedures? The idea that you can use the IRS as a political weapon is incorrect as a matter of statutory law and constitutionally. We should not be in a situation where an individual’s private tax returns are used for political purpose. What stop another party from doing the same thing. by the way.”

Dan Kildee (D-MI) warned of President Donald Trump’s potential for “abuse of authority” while discussing Democratic lawmakers attempt to get six years of President Donald Trump’s tax returns.
Kildee said, “It is not up to President Trump or some lawyer that President Trump hires, to determine whether or not this co-equal branch of government has the tools available to it to make the deliberations necessary in order to make policy. This is not an autocracy. The president does not get to decide for himself and for Congress what a legitimate subject of inquiry might be. That’s left to the Congress.”
He continued, “Previous presidents in the last half-century have released their tax returns. And it would be easy for not just Congress but any member of the public to take a look at that and make determinations as to whether or not the tax laws of the United States are being properly administered and applied to the president. In this case, and particularly in this case, where you have a president that not only has very significant wealth, but made the unusual decision to continue to control that wealth, and not to have a blind trust but pass on to his family with his full involvement, the ability to control his wealth. There’s a real question as to whether the president’s personal financial interests impact his public decision making. The public has a right to know whether the president’s interests are impacting the decisions he makes using the authority that we have granted him by electing him as president.”
He added, “We have a very legitimate public policy question that we’re looking at. We’re not asking for the returns to be made public. It’s not clear that other members of the committee, myself included, will ever see this information. This is specific to Chairman Neal. He needs this to frame the questions we’re trying to answer and the policies we’re trying to potentially enact. Anybody who knows Donald Trump should be concerned about his abuse of authority.”

(photo credit: Courtesy)
Oman’s Foreign Ministry re-affirmed the country’s commitment to the Palestinians a day after the minister responsible for foreign affairs said it was important to reassure Israel that it was not threatened. Oman’s Yusuf bin Alawi bin Abdullah made the initial comments on Saturday in Jordan at a World Economic Forum event. Oman is now trying to re-assure the Palestinians too with tweets and meetings on Sunday.Last year Oman hosted Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for a historic visit. At the Jordan conference Alawi said that Israel had fears due to being a non-Arab country in the region. “I believe that we Arabs must be able to look into this issue and try to east those fears.” He said this would help the future relations between countries. He also met Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas on the sidelines of the event. At the meeting he discussed developments in the region and Jerusalem. “The Sultanate’s consistent position in support of the Palestinian brethren in their aspirations for the establishment of a Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital, as well as efforts made by the Sultanate in supporting the causes,” were emphasized, the foreign ministry said.Prime Minister Netanyahu met Alawi in Warsaw in February. Israel’s foreign ministry released a statement saying that “we discussed additional steps we can take together with the countries of the region in order to advance common interests.” Alawi said the meeting was important. “This is a new era for the future and prosperity for every nation.” But Oman has said that a two state solution must take place for normalization to happen.Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi responded to Alawi’s comments in Jordan by noting that the Arab world has recognized Israel’s right to exist. “The issue is that there is an occupation.” He responded to the Omanis that the problem is not the Arab assurances, “the problem is with Israel doing what is right for peace.”The World Economic Foreign event in Jordan comes at an important time for Jordan and also for the region. There is concern about the US administration putting forward a peace plan and what it might entail. Despite having a peace agreement with Jordan Israel was not present at the event, a symbol that even though there is peace, Israel rarely is able to participate in regional events.

Tactile Mobility adds missing sense of touch to autonomous vehicles,www.jpost.com,EYTAN HALON,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.jpost.com/Jpost-Tech/Business-and-Innovation/Tactile-Mobility-adds-missing-sense-of-touch-to-autonomous-vehicles-586034,"Business And Innovation Tactile Mobility adds missing sense of touch to autonomous vehicles ""Where other companies enable smart and autonomous vehicles to see the road, we enable those vehicles to feel the road,"" Tactile Mobility CEO Amit Nisenbaum said. Tactile Mobility CEO Amit Nisenbaum. (photo credit: ASAF HABER) UPGRADE YOUR JPOST EXPERIENCE FOR 5$ PER MONTH Show me later
If the world’s automotive giants have their way, autonomous vehicles will gradually roll out onto the world’s streets by the beginning of next decade.A combination of sophisticated cameras, radar and lidar (light detection and ranging) sensors will enable smart and self-driving vehicles of varying autonomy to “watch” the road ahead and deliver their passengers safely to their destinations. Of course, soon-to-be-outdated human drivers do not only look for hazards ahead, but feel the dynamics of every bump of the road with their bodies and incorporate that, often subconsciously, into their decision-making process.Founded in 2012 by serial entrepreneur Boaz Mizrachi, Haifa-based start-up Tactile Mobility aims to add that missing human-like sense of touch to smart and autonomous vehicles, and provide data to make vehicles smarter and safer.“Where other companies enable smart and autonomous vehicles to see the road, we enable those vehicles to feel the road,” Tactile Mobility CEO Amit Nisenbaum told The Jerusalem Post .“We do it with software only and based on data generated by multiple, non-visual existing sensors,” said Nisenbaum, who splits his time between Haifa and the company’s Silicon Valley office.The company’s mapping cloud module applies big data and machine-learning technologies to data gathered from multiple vehicles, which can then be downloaded back to the vehicle’s computers for improved performance and used for analysis by third-party entities, including road authorities and insurers.Using the signals, the software module runs algorithms and artificial intelligence to generate real-time insights regarding physical factors that impact any ride and augment existing sensory data.The company’s mapping cloud module applies big data and machine-learning technologies to data gathered from multiple vehicles, which can then be downloaded back to the vehicle’s computers for improved performance and analysis by third-party entities, including road authorities and insurers.“There is always a compromise between safety and user experience in autonomous vehicles. They rely on cameras and lidar sensors, know the vehicle speed, the speed of the vehicle in front, its distance from your vehicle, and calculate the safe distance of the vehicle given relative velocities, but they don’t know the road grip level,” said Nisenbaum.“They need to assume that there is a low grip level in order to be safe. But that’s sub-par from the user experience, because a user is used to driving in a certain way and at a certain speed.”Tactile Mobility is currently working to implement its technology with six leading car manufacturers in Europe and North America, including American automobile giant Ford. While the company’s software can be embedded in existing vehicles, it hopes to see its technology included in mass-market production as soon as the 2020 and 2021 model years.“The more computerized that vehicles are becoming, and not just fully-autonomous vehicles, the computers need to have an additional sense of tactility as well,” said Nisenbaum.

Samsung Galaxy S10 5G open at Verizon on April 18,ednews.net,,04-07-2019,2019,4,http://ednews.net/en/news/sience/361480-samsung-galaxy-s10-5g-open-at-verizon-on-april-18,"1 2 3 4 5 Samsung Galaxy S10 5G open at Verizon on April 18 A- A A+
When it comes to 5G devices, carriers in the United States don't have too many alternatives, even though many smartphone makers promised to bring their products on the shelves this year. Currently, there's only one phone that US carrier can offer to its customers if they want to sell their 5G services, the Moto Z3, but you'll have to buy an additional Moto Mod for that to work.
A second option would be the Samsung Galaxy S10 5G, the smartphone the South Korean company unveiled along with the other Galaxy S10 series phones two months ago. However, while the non-5G flagships got release dates and prices, details about the Galaxy S10 5G availability and price were skipped from the initial announcement.
Until yesterday, when well-known leaker Evan Blass revealed that the Samsung Galaxy S10 5G will be available from Verizon on May 16. No information about pricing options emerged though, so we're still in the dark on that one.
A more recent report from Bloomberg points out that Verizon customers will actually be able to pre-order the Samsung Galaxy S10 5G starting April 18. We still don't get a price for the 5G-enabled flagship, but we know for sure that will cost more than $1,000 outright.
If we combine both pieces of information, then we get the picture, but not the whole puzzle. Verizon will open Samsung Galaxy S10 5G pre-orders on April 18, but the smartphone will hit shelves one month later, on May 16.
The only thing that remains to learn is how much Verizon will charge customers for the 5G-powered flagship and whether or not there will be any promotions that will make the device more appealing.
The Galaxy S10 5G has the same hardware configuration as the regular Galaxy S10 flagship but adds 5G support into the mix. The most expensive Galaxy S10 model is available in the US for $1,150, but you can get it for much cheaper since Samsung and other retailers and carriers in the country run multiple promotions on a regular basis.
It makes perfect sense for the Galaxy S10 5G to be priced well over $1,000, especially that it will be one of the few 5G smartphones available for purchase in the United States. On the downside, there's only one US carrier that offers 5G services at the moment, and even Verizon only has the service available in two cities, Chicago and Minneapolis.

First Punic War: 256 BC: Roman Army Fights 120 Foot Long Snake,lunaticoutpost.com,,04-07-2019,2019,4,http://lunaticoutpost.com/thread-120718.html,"First Punic War: 256 BC: Roman Army Fights 120 Foot Long Snake Advertisement Quote: A New Threat In the later sources there is a strange incident that appears during this time. Regulus and the army made camp at some point near a river. Unfortunately for the Romans they were not the only ones there. Some unsuspecting soldiers were slaughtered at the riverside until the rest of the army realized what was going on. A giant snake had apparently been killing men who came too near to its liking. At least the consul reacted swiftly. According to Zonaras, “Regulus overcame it with a crowd of soldiers and with catapults.” (Zonaras 8.13)5 That’s right. The Roman army literally used catapults to slay a giant snake. However, in their defense the snake was one hundred and twenty feet long and was proportionally wide around. Yes, I wrote one hundred and twenty feet. This story is also recorded by John of Damascus, a major church theologian of the seventh and eighth centuries. He directly states that he is using Cassius Dio as a source here and gives the same figures for the snake’s size. After the serpent was defeated, it was skinned and the snake’s hide was sent back to Rome. Here, the Senate measured the snake so we can be sure that the length of the snake isn’t being exaggerated or anything like that. Regulus and the Bagradas Dragon When the Romans decided to invade Africa in 256 BC to bring an end to their war with Carthage, they supposedly encountered more than just Punic elephants and a cunning Spartan condottiero. Quote: ... It also forced them to march across the river Bagradas (the modern Medjerda River). It was here that they met with their enigmatic enemy. Our oldest source for this event comes to us second hand, as a fragment, from Aulus Gellius, who copied the version of Quintus Aelius Tubero (NA 7.3). Tubero was writing in the late first century BC, while Gellius’ Attic Nights was assembled in the second century AD. According to Tubero (source): The consul Atilius Regulus, when encamped at the Bagradas river in Africa, fought a stubborn and fierce battle with a single serpent of extraordinary size, which had its lair in that region; that in a might struggle with the entire army the reptile was attacked for a long time with hurling engines and catapults; and that when it was finally killed, its skin, a hundred and twenty feet long, was sent to Rome. The next earliest version of the story we have is brief in the extreme, and comes from the Periochae of Livy, summaries of the books of his Ab Urbe Condita written between the second and fourth centuries AD. Livy’s flourish, however, was the end of the first century BC through to about AD 17, placing the original source material earlier than other mentions of the incident. In this work, we hear for Book 18 that “in Africa, Atilius Regulus killed an unnaturally enormous serpent with significant losses to his forces” (transl. Jane D. Chaplin). A more detailed version of Livy’s account can be found in Valerius Maximus’ Facta et Dicta Memorabilia, written during the reign of the emperor Tiberius. He explicitly cites Livy for the story, giving us an idea of what we’ve lost in his Book 18:Show The serpent of the Bagradas River in Africa was of such a size that it denied the army of Regulus access to the river. Many soldiers it seized in its enormous mouth and crushed to death not a few of them with its whirling tail. It could not be penetrated by the missiles thrown at it. Finally, they attacked it with many stones launched from ballistae from every side, it was brought down by the weighty blows. After his men finally delivered unto the beast the killing blow, they were forced to move their camp from the area, now polluted by the gasses and goo emanating from the corpse. They waited around long enough, though, to skin it, and send that off to Rome, as in Tubero’s account, above. Even longer than that preserved by Valerius Maximus, is the version of Orosius, which may well derive from Livy (source): Regulus, chosen by lot for the Carthaginian War, marched with his army to a point not far from the Bagrada River and there pitched his camp. In that place a reptile of astonishing size devoured many of the soldiers as they went down to the river to get water. Regulus set out with his army to attack the reptile. Neither the javelins they hurled nor the darts they rained upon its back had any effect. These glided off its horrible scaly fins as if from a slanting testudo of shields and were in some miraculous fashion turned away from its body so that the creature suffered no injury. Finally, when Regulus saw that it was killing a great number of his soldiers with its bites, was trampling them down by its charge, and driving them mad by its poisonous breath, he ordered ballistae brought up. A stone taken from a wall was hurled by a ballista; this struck the spine of the serpent and caused its entire body to become numb. The formation of the reptile was such that, though it seemed to lack feet, yet it had ribs and scales graded evenly, extending from the top of its throat to the lowest part of its belly and so arranged that the creature rested upon its scales as if on claws and upon its ribs as if on legs. But it did not move like the worm which has a flexible spine and moves by first stretching its contracted parts in the direction of its tiny body and then drawing together the stretched parts. This reptile made its way by a sinuous movement, extending its sides first right and then left, so that it might keep the line of ribs rigid along the exterior arch of the spine; nature fastened the claws of its scales to its ribs, which extend straight to their highest point; making these moves alternately and quickly, it not only glided over levels, but also mounted inclines, taking as many footsteps, so to speak, as it had ribs. This is why the stone rendered the creature powerless. If struck by a blow in any part of the body from its bowels to its head, it is crippled and unable to move, because wherever the blow falls, it numbs the spine, which stimulates the feet of the ribs and the motion of the body. Hence this serpent, which had for a long time withstood so many javelins unharmed, moved about disabled from the blow of a single stone and, quickly overcome by spears, was easily destroyed. Its skin was brought to Rome—it is said to have been one hundred and twenty feet in length— and for some time was an object of wonder to all. The longest, and most elaborate version of the story we possess, though, comes from Silius Italicus’ Punica, the second century AD epic poem about the Second Punic War (Sil. Pun. 6.140-293). It is narrated by a man named Marus, supposedly one of Regulus’ soldiers who had made it back to Rome after the disastrous campaign. This retelling is much more colorful, and was certainly elaborated by Silius to fit into his poem as a dramatic and scintillating digression. Although the outcome was the same as in the “historical” accounts, the details associated with the beast are more literary. As Daniel Ogden has pointed out, Silius was “eager to inscribe his Bagrada Dragon” within “an implicit canon of great dragons”, such as that of the Giants and the Lernaean Hydra.Show It is worth pointing out at this point that the language I have used is rather loose in describing the beast. In the Latin accounts, the term used is serpens, meaning both “serpent” and often “dragon.”Show However, our one Greek source makes it fairly clear that, at least by the time Cassius Dio was writing in the early third century AD, the creature was identified with the Greek term drakon (Zonar. 13.1 = Cass. Dio frg. 42.23). That said, the descriptions we have make it out to be a large snake-like animal, as it lacked legs."

The move could hinder peace talks with the Palestinians. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Saturday that if he secured another term in office, he would move to annex Jewish settlements in the West Bank. The remark came ahead of nationwide elections in Israel that will take place next week. ""I won't clear a single settlement. And I will naturally ensure that we control the area west of the Jordan River,"" Netanyahu said during an interview with Israeli television. Netanyahu has promoted Jewish settlement expansion into the territory during his four terms as prime minister, but he had stopped short of saying he would annex settlements, until now.

The Weight of the World,www.commonwealmagazine.org,Renée Darline Roden,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.commonwealmagazine.org/weight-world,"The Weight of the World With God in New York City Print John Singer Sargent, Atlas and the Hesperides, ca 1922-25 (Museum of Fine Arts, Boston)
Standing by the altar of St. Patrick’s, I look up and onto Fifth Avenue. The Cathedral’s titanic bronze doors are flung open in an extravagant gesture of welcome, inviting the avenue’s commercial hubbub into the sanctuary. Tourists circulate through the bright narthex, standing off with vigilant ushers over verboten coffee cups, reflexively snapping photos. A co-mingling of the profane and divine.
Across the avenue is the colossal bronze Atlas that guards Rockefeller Center. His muscular form fills the width of St. Patrick’s doorway. Frozen in his ascent to a podium, he hefts the sphere of the heavens, dotted with astrological symbols. I find him an aspirational image—a form to be grasped at. Atlas’s cosmic burden may be a punishment, but his sentence also seems to offer benefits. I idolize his ability to stand outside the universe, to contain its chaos on his back: to be singular, unattached.
Directly behind me hangs a small Christ on the cross. The baldachin of the cathedral’s main altar soars in front of the crucifix, cross and corpus upstaged by splendor. This god is not a titan but a helpless creature, thrown into the world. And the world has left him in pretty rough shape.
*
I am afraid of disappointment, both the receiving and causing of it. In a city that ignores human limitation, this helpless Christ is an unwelcome reminder of the inevitability of letdown. Christ dives into our history, his arms open in fearless embracing. share
I imagine an ideal mother; the image may be an illusion, but it exerts real force. My real mother tests the limits of the clock to teach coding, sew ballet costumes, and care for her husband and six children—four adult, two still in high school. She works overtime to keep from failing the many to whom she promises herself. But the ideal escapes her—her limitation inevitably leads to my disappointment. There’s a too-long list of phone calls that I have aborted in bruised frustration. Sounds like you’re busy, I’ll call back later .
Disappointment is infectious. I know my mother feels its sting: both for upsetting me, and for modeling how to renege on a promise to be present. Do as I say not as I do is the desperate prayer of parent, teacher, friend. Please be as I would be, not as I am. But in a birthday phone call to my sister, I cut her short in a rush. Hey, sorry, I’m underground, getting on the train now, can I call you later ? Unlimited availability eludes me, too. The gap between who I need you to be for me and who you are is a mutual pain.
In For the Time Being , Auden’s Mary wrestles with the fear of disappointing her divine infant:
What can you discover / From my tender look but how to be afraid? What have you learned from the womb that bore you / But an anxiety your Father cannot feel?
Disappointment is the inevitable side effect of loving human beings with wounded histories, fragile psyches.
Rather, he emptied himself and took the form of a slave being born in the likeness of men.
“The likeness of men” means “disarray.” What can I be to the people I love but the vehicle of inherited limitations and imperfections?
“The likeness of men” means slogging through Manhattan February slush and riding the 1 train from Wall Street to 145th, clutching what little dignity I have to resist shoving the commuters in front of me, and carrying bags overloaded with books I optimistically thought I would read that day, up five blocks and several flights of stairs to my apartment—and I am met by no one. The world is already dark at 5 pm, and I call my mother; she does not pick up the phone. It’s a ripe hour for self-pity in a small apartment whose Ikea mirrors are still not mounted on the walls.
“The likeness of men” means me, who now wanders from the apartment to the Hudson, to the circular terrace on Riverside and 152nd, which is perpetually littered with cigarette butts and smashed beer bottles. Aristocratic in design, this terrace is a weed-incensed hangout where one twenty-something opens up her breviary to David’s angstiest psalm. In the likeness of this terrace, I find the shape of my life—dictated not by myself, but by the humans who populate it.
*
Salvation, for our god, did not mean recusing himself from human love. Jesus, too, had a mother and the entangled inheritance of family. Jesus also chose a happy inner ring of confidantes—the people to whom he entrusted his life and mission.
They betrayed his trust. The abandoned God hangs on the cross, disappointed. His limp, defeated body is the portrait of someone I do not want to be: someone whose life was dangerously tangled up in others’.
Atlas’s punishment does not risk this disappointment—he carries his globe without breaking the hermetic seal between your life and mine . The world is a monstrous weight he shoulders alone.
But Christ’s body, made of fallible flesh, abandoned by fearful friends, bears the weight of a shared world not as punishment, but salvation. He dives into our history, his arms open in fearless embracing, an eternal emptying for you, for me. Tags Lent

In response to the growing knife crime crisis, Home Secretary Sajid Javid has announced new “stop-and-search” powers for police across London and 6 other metropolitan areas around the country, together accounting for 60 percent of reported knife crime.

Trump EPA weighs reviving Mississippi Flooding project that is massive,www.dailypolitical.com,Stacy Sanders,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailypolitical.com/2019/04/07/trump-epa-weighs-reviving-mississippi-flooding-project-that-is-massive.html,"Two Sigma Advisers LP Has $2.63 Million Holdings in Venator Materials PLC (VNTR) Trump EPA weighs reviving Mississippi Flooding project that is massive April 7th, 2019 - Comments Off on Trump EPA weighs reviving Mississippi Flooding project that is massive - Filed Under - by Stacy Sanders Tweet
Since Mississippi’s governor lacked massive flooding from the nation, the Trump government said Wednesday that it is giving another appearance to a long-dead flood control and drainage project in the Mississippi Delta who was murdered by the George W. Bush administration due to its potential effect on wetlands and wildlife.
The project, that the late Sen. John McCain formerly called”one of the worst projects ever conceived by Congress,” had called for huge pumps to be constructed at the confluence of the Yazoo and Mississippi Rivers in Mississippi. The Bush government rejected it in 2008. Get alerts:
“Had that not happened, we believe that the flooding, particularly in the Yazoo backwater, would have been much less harmful,” said Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant, after touring the area . Opponents say the pumps may worsen flooding downstream.
After touring the area, Bryant told journalists that he had spent Tuesday and Monday from Washington, lobbying the government to reevaluate the 2008 EPAs decision to kill the project. On Wednesday, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Andrew Wheeler confirmed that his bureau is now reconsidering that 2008 decision.
Communities along the Mississippi River are dealing with flood for almost two months. Farmers say flooding is harming them .
Bryant, who has aligned himself closely with President Donald Trump, said that more than 1,100 homes are changed, even though some of those are not bombarded, but in regions. Water is indeed common in the area that a number of folks build levees .
Environmentalists say the pumps are capable of draining more than 200,000 acres (80,000 hectares) of wetlands — an area bigger than most five boroughs of new york.
Often and the soggy flooded lowlands have houses but are vital to wildlife groups say. The National Wildlife Federation reported the pumps would function primarily”so large landowners will increase agricultural production on marginal lands which have always bombarded.”
Bob Irvin, president of the American Rivers conservation group, stated in an email Wednesday the EPA was moving to revive a”zombie” project.
“Nothing has changed because the first Bush administration realized that the Yazoo Pumps project had been an ecological disaster and also an economic collapse,” Irvin said.
The Bush government had resisted the sterile Water Act, saying it could cause”unacceptable damage” to valuable resources. It had been one of only about a dozen times the water law had been invoked to reject a project.
The pump job has been pushed from the Delta Council, business group and a farming that includes many big farmers in the fertile Mississippi Delta. Before retiring from the Senate, long a proponent of the project, Thad Cochran, made a last effort annually to place language in a spending bill ordering pump construction to begin regardless of the EPA veto .
Sharkey County Supervisor Bill Newsom, that also oversees a cotton gin, is one of many proponents of those pumps. He says farming is the only business in the area, also says he doesn’t want to empty the wetlands, simply control flooding of the region.
“We are just simply trying to have a flood level we could dwell at,” Newsom said last month.

Rachel del Guidice: We’re joined on The Daily Signal podcast today by Tom and Linda Balek and their son, Jeff Balek, who traveled to Washington, D.C., from South Carolina to ask lawmakers to sign a discharge petition to force a vote on legislation to protect babies born alive after an abortion. Thank you all so very much for joining us today. Linda Balek: You’re welcome. Tom Balek: You’re welcome. Happy to be here. del Guidice: Tom and Linda, you have a very moving personal story about your son, Jeff, and why he has made you so passionate about this issue. Could you share that story with us? Tom Balek: Our family is very pro-life, and it’s largely because of the experience we had with our son, Jeff. Jeff was born in 1980. He was a 26-week term baby. He was a twin, premature twin. And Jeff is living, walking, breathing, drumming proof that second-trimester babies are people. We’re not only opposed to abortion, we’re very opposed to late-term abortion for that reason. And very, very, very opposed to infanticide, which is the direction things seem to be going in the pro-abortion movement. del Guidice: Jeff, what has it been like to advocate and to speak to lawmakers about this issue that you’re so passionate about as well? Jeff Balek: I’m just glad that I’m living and walking and loved talking to the lawmakers yesterday. It was a good discussion. del Guidice: Well, thank you for talking to us. Tom, when we were talking yesterday, you said that not only was Jeff a viable baby and human being, he’s also an asset to the community and your family and this is your walking defense against abortion. Can you tell us more about … the so many things he’s accomplished? Tom Balek: Sure. Jeff is a community treasure. He has received a lot of awards nationally and locally for his volunteer service. He has been working as a tutor of at-risk elementary students for many years. Jeff Balek: And I volunteer for the hospice patients, too, in Charlotte. Loving doing that. I read the Bible to them. Tom Balek: Jeff has done all kinds of volunteer work and is a real advocate for at-risk kids. He uses twin-vision Braille books that have Braille overlays along with the text and images in the regular kids books. That’s really interesting to them. And as much as anything, they’re fascinated meeting a blind guy who can read and function. Linda Balek: The great thing about talking to local kids is they will ask the craziest questions that will just make you roll on the floor, and then Jeff will just answer them and it’s just all good. del Guidice: Wow, that is beautiful. You spent your time here, in our nation’s capital, joining 50-plus Heritage Action sentinels from across the country who came here to D.C. to encourage lawmakers to sign the discharge petition in support of the born-alive bill. What has this experience been like and what kind of response have you been receiving from lawmakers? Tom Balek: Every trip to Heritage in Washington is an absolute blast, we get to see all of our friends. We’ve been active with the Heritage sentinels program for many years and I’ve been on a number of trips to The Heritage Foundation and Heritage Action. When we’re here, we get to see our friends and get some important work done. It was great to be on the Hill yesterday. We didn’t get to meet any congressmen, other than our own, our wonderful Ralph Norman from our district in South Carolina. But we talked with staffers and got some good responses about our promotion of the [Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act], and we’re encouraging them to sign the discharge petition so that that bill can be moved from committee to the floor for a vote. My understanding is we need 18 more, isn’t that right, Linda? Linda Balek: I think so. They seem to be a lot more receptive on this issue than other issues we’ve gone up and discussed. It’s hard for them to say something like, “It’s a partisan issue,” because it’s not, it’s a life. And I think that makes a little bit less pressure on them. However, I think it’s going to take some encouragement and follow-up to make sure they stay on task. Tom Balek: We can share some of the interesting responses we got yesterday on the Hill if you’re interested in that. del Guidice: Yeah, I’d love to hear what you guys were talking about. Tom Balek: We were speaking to staffers in one of the congressmen’s offices and they said they had been receiving phone calls all day about the discharge petition and they said, we don’t know if this is true or not, but they said, “About half of our callers are in favor of the Born-Alive Act and about half are opposed.” I asked the question of the legislative director, “So, why are half of them opposed to it? Do you ever ask the question, ‘Why are you opposed?'” I just got a blank stare. I don’t think anybody would admit that they are in favor of leaving a living, breathing baby on a shelf to die. Who’s going to admit to that? This is such a slam dunk. It’s mind-boggling that there’s any opposition to this at all and I don’t understand why every congressman hasn’t signed that discharge petition. Linda Balek: My whole question is, when does life start then for these people? Does somebody have a 3-year-old and they’re tired of being a mother to a 3-year-old, that can be a little trying at times, and think, “Gee, I just don’t want a baby, just put it in the dumpster.” It’s about that crude. It’s just as crazy as what they’re doing with this born-alive baby. Tom Balek: We’re from York County, South Carolina, and a recent item in the news there referred to a woman who had 22 horses and 15 dogs and cats that all died on her property because she was ill and in the hospital and hadn’t arranged to get them fed. And she was being charged and likely will have jail time or a significant sentence for not feeding horses and dogs and cats. That’s clearly illegal in everybody’s mind, and I’ll bet you all of the Democrats on the Hill would think that’s horrific, and yet they can’t support providing medical care to a newborn baby who’s alive in front of the doctor. Mind-boggling. del Guidice: It is so mind-boggling. What would your message be, Tom and Linda, to parents who might have received news that there’s complications with their pregnancy and are being encouraged to have an abortion? Given your own personal experience, what would your message to them be? Linda Balek: Doctors are practicing. They aren’t God and they don’t really know what’s going to happen. I believe that every child has a value. I have seen kids that are so un-normal, for lack of a better word, that have blessed their families so much. Tom Balek: Our sons were born at 26 weeks. Jeff was the tough one, he survived. And he has had some residual problems, and really not exactly as a result of his premature birth. But that was 39 years ago. That was in 1980. So, for people to second-guess the viability of an in utero baby … I don’t think is appropriate at all. Like Linda said, that’s a human life. Our Christian belief is that that is a soul since conception. del Guidice: Besides the advocacy work you all do, your family also has its own band. Can you tell us a little bit about that? Tom Balek: Jeff, tell us about the band. Jeff Balek: The band is named “Caution! Blind Driver,” and of course the drummer is the driver of the band and we have a lot of funny photos on our website. We were at my sister’s house and all of us were in the car, my sister, her husband, my mom and dad, and me. I had my cane outside the windowrolled downmy hands on the steering wheel, my knees on the seat of the truck, and everybody all terrified. “Caution! Blind Driver,” you know? And there was a sign there that said, “Sorry, officer, just going to our next gig.” Tom Balek: Yeah, it’s keen traveling with our truck. Jeff Balek: Yeah. Tom Balek: I have to tell you, I’ve been a musician all my life and I’m really, really, really, really old, and there is no drummer in the world I’d rather play with than this blind guy right here next to me. He’s an incredible musician. So, in addition to being a good volunteer and a pretty good guy, I don’t know what I’d do without him in our band. My daughter plays bass with us, so it’s a family band. This weekend we’re playing a festival in the Charlotte area. It’s a big dog festival. Thousands of families come with their dogs. And we’ll be playing for several hours there on the big stage. Of course we had to learn a whole bunch of dog songs, didn’t we Jeff? Jeff Balek: Yes, we did. del Guidice: That’s incredible. So, you’ve spent your time here in D.C. petitioning to support the born-alive legislation. And I know you talked to some lawmakers, but you weren’t able to obviously speak to each one. If you had the opportunity to talk to each one of them, what would be the one thing that you would want to say to them? Tom Balek: … I would ask them, “How or why are you opposed to protecting a newborn baby, offering it the medical care that you would make available to any other human being? What’s the difference between a baby that’s 6 minutes old, 6 days old, or 6 years old?” A person’s a person and entitled to medical care. That would be my question for every single one of them. “What is it that you oppose?” Linda Balek: Some of them tend to be getting lost in the weeds and furthering their side by saying, “Well, who’s going to pay for this and what are we going to do with the baby?” And things like that. There are plenty of people out there that I know personally that have had to go to foreign countries to adopt children and would take a baby in a heartbeat in any condition. I think the thing to remember, too, is a lot of our homegrown adoption agencies have been sued to oblivion, that are faith-based, and therefore are no longer being able to adopt out these babies. We have a lot of different organizations just wanting them to adopt them to just anybody, and they oftentimes believe that they’re supposed to be a man and a woman and a family and they’re supposed to stay at home, somebody is, to raise the child and be parents. Tom Balek: And when there’s a human life at stake, you deal with what’s in front of you. You don’t take the time to question who’s paying, who’s responsible, what about custody, what about this and that detail. You save that human life because a human life is precious. Linda Balek: As someone said yesterday, she goes by in D.C. here, [she sees] homeless people all the time and occasionally there’s somebody that’s OD’d. The services come and help them. And they don’t go through his pockets to see how he’s going to pay for it or if he’s going to pay for it, they just take care of the person. Tom Balek: To save that human life, yeah. del Guidice: Well, Tom, Linda, and Jeff, thank you so very much for being with us today. Tom Balek: Thank you guys for all you do. Jeff Balek: Thank you so much. Tom Balek: We are just tremendous fans and advocates of The Heritage Foundation and Heritage Action, and as a conservative activist there’s no place else I’d rather be than right here in the Heritage building. del Guidice: Well, thank you all."
Senate Republicans Have Triggered the ‘Nuclear Option.’ They Are Completely Justified,www.szone.us,@Heritage,04-07-2019,2019,4,http://www.szone.us/showthread.php?p=248269,"Senate Republicans Have Triggered the Nuclear Option. They Are Completely Justified On 04.05.19 05:25 AM posted by Thomas Jipping Most people agree that our system of government depends on an informed, participating citizenry. It can be hard enough to understand what Congress is doing, but its even harder to grasp how Congress operates. And yet, rules that govern how things get done often determine what those things end up being. As such, its very important that Americans understand how the Senate majority just changedand hopefully, improvedthe process for debating the presidents nominations. Senate Republicans on Wednesday, in a pair of 51-48 votes almost entirely along party lines, revised one part of that process. The move will expedite the confirmation process for President Donald Trumps district court nominees and sub-Cabinet posts at federal departments and agencies. The Constitution doesnt say much about this process, only that the president needs the Senates advice and consent before he can appoint someone he has nominated. Then the Constitution gives the Senate authority to establish the rules of its proceedings. In other words, the Constitution assigns this role to the Senate, but without telling the Senate how to do it. The process of the Senate evaluating nominees and deciding whether to give its consent is often called the confirmation process, and it operated pretty smoothly for nearly two centuries. But as the federal government grew in size and power, the appointment of those who lead it has become more important and, therefore, more contentious. Though designed to be the weakest branch, the judiciary has in recent decades become the strongest. Its power to determine what our laws mean is magnified because judges do not have limited terms. Once they are appointed, they serve until they decide to leave, an average of nearly 25 years. As a result, the judicial confirmation process has become particularly difficult. Until the past couple of decades, 96% of federal judges were confirmed without even a roll call, or recorded, vote, and 97% had no opposition at all. Those days are gone. Trump is making significantly more judicial nominationsand the Senate Judiciary Committee is holding hearings for far more of themthan under the previous five presidents. Final confirmations by the full Senate, however, are off the pace. The cause is an organized campaign, utilizing several specific tactics, by Democrats and their liberal allies to make the rest of the process as slow and cumbersome as possible. Senate Republicans have now neutralized one of those tactics. Senate Rule 22 provides for a process to invoke cloture, or end debate, which is necessary before the Senate can vote on confirmation. Even when the Senate votes to bring debate to a close, however, Rule 22 allows up to 30 more hours of debate. Democrats had abused that part of the Rule 22 process. First, they refused to shorten that 30-hour period of debate even for nominations they didnt intend to oppose. Second, they almost never actually went to the Senate floor and debated the nomination being considered. That was just empty time, with the clock ticking for no purpose other than delaying the inevitable. Nominations that would have been confirmed in a few hours took several days. On Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell gave Democrats a final opportunity to dial back such obstruction. The Kentucky Republican brought up a resolution to shorten post-cloture debate for most nominations with limits very similar to those the Senate voted 78-16 to adopt for the 113th Congress (2013-14). Democrats supported those limits when they ran the Senate under President Barack Obama, but filibustered them now that they are the minority under Trump. On Wednesday, McConnell achieved the same reform in a different way. He proposed lower limits on post-cloture debate, not in the form of a written resolution, but as a point of order, or a question of procedure that required an answer from the Senates presiding officer. The full Senate then voted on whether to endorse the presiding officers decision. McConnell used this approach because it could not be stopped by a filibuster the way the resolution had been the day before. Remember, that is the very last step before a final confirmation vote. The Senate has already voted, often overwhelmingly, that it wants to end debate. Making that final period of available debate a little shorter is not, in the big scheme of things, a significant step. It can, however, have a significant impact. When similar debate limits were in place in 2014, the Senate confirmed 89 judicial nominations, the second-highest annual total in American history. Even if Democrats continue forcing the Senate to use the formal Rule 22 process to end debate, the Senate will be able to do so for more nominees in a shorter period of time. Today, 142 positions across the federal judiciary are vacant, the highest number since June 1991. Of those vacancies, 90% are on the U.S. District Court, the lowest level of the judiciary, where every case must begin. No business or organization could function properly if 17% of its workforce was absent, yet that is the condition of the federal judiciary today. The bottom line is that the Senates process for considering nominations has become too divisive and subject to abuse. The judiciary, and the American people who depend on it, suffer as a result. While controversies can arise about an individual nominee here or there, the process must be less cumbersome for the large majority, who should be easily confirmed. Republicans have, in effect, opened one of the gates that have kept the process backed up. They need to seize this opportunity so that the government that Americans elected in 2016 can function as it should."
Why All the Blame for Venezuela’s Woes Falls on Chavez and Maduro,www.szone.us,@Heritage,04-07-2019,2019,4,http://www.szone.us/showthread.php?p=248268,"Why All the Blame for Venezuelas Woes Falls on Chavez and Maduro On 04.05.19 05:46 AM posted by Daniel Garza After my recent Spanish-language column at Univision.com looked at the economic collapse in Venezuela, I heard from proponents of socialism who tried to blame the disaster not on the socialist policies of Hugo Chavez and Nicolas Maduro, but on American economic sanctions. The past week saw even more terrible news from Venezuela, with a weeklong power outage and images of people in a once-wealthy country now reduced to getting drinking water from tainted rivers. Its essential that we draw the right lessonsso that no one else makes the mistake of going down this same road. The track record shows that long after Chavez was electedand long after he imposed destructive policies that put Venezuela on the road to economic ruinVenezuela continued to benefit from strong economic ties with the U.S. The Maduro regime and its supporters abroad like to blame sanctions, but*according to the Congressional Research Service , the first U.S. economic sanctions on the Caracas government did not begin until 2008, and even those were limited to only a few individuals and institutions. More serious U.S. sanctions came years later. The numbers show that Americans and American companies continued boosting the Venezuelan economy with trade and investment well into the reign of Chavez. American investment in Venezuela, investment that supported job creation, actually grew in the years after 2000reaching $13.5 billion in 2008. After a brief two-year dip, it began climbing again and exceeded $13 billion in 2013. So, American investors were committing resources to Venezuela in ways that helped increase economic opportunity. It’s a similar story with imports and exports . In the year 2000, total annual trade between the United States and Venezuela was under $24 billion. By 2008, two-way trade had climbed to nearly $64 billionwith more than $50 billion going from the United States to Venezuela in just one year to pay for imports from that country. By 2012, trade between the two countries had slowed somewhat, but even then it totaled nearly $60 billionstill a large increase during the Chavez years. We know that Chavez made major destabilizing changes in Venezuela long before. Chavez was first elected in Venezuela in 1998, vowing to fight corruption and make sure that national wealth was shared more broadly and fairly. In 2001, he pushed through a land confiscation and redistribution scheme*that failed , leading*to reduced food production and increased need for imports. The land reform, combined with the currency controls imposed in 2003, badly hurt Venezuela’s agricultural sector . Those failures werent the result of any outside interference; they were homegrown. Chavez imposed numerous other changes as well, many intended to shut down criticism and concentrate power in his hands and those of his cronies. In 2002, he purged PDVSA, the national oil company, of dissidents and critics of his socialist policies and leadership, then continued purges the next year. Not surprisingly, oil output in Venezuela began a multiyear decline during and after these purges. In 2003, Chavez began imposing price controls. In 2005 came the breakup of large estates and regulations to punish critics in the media. In 2006, the outright nationalization of private companies began. That same year saw a military deal with Russia. Yet through all of this, American investment in Venezuela continued and grew, and trade between the two nations actually expanded. American sanctions didnt contribute to the growing economic problems during this era, because there were none. In 2009, the government imposed production quotas for staples, leading to shortages. In 2010, Chavez devalued the currency, the bolivar, to try to boost oil revenues. Moves like that may produce short-term results, but they destabilize the economy and frighten investors, hurting growth in the longer term. In 2012 came more price controls, and then Chavezs victory in a fourth consecutive presidential electionbut only after he pushed through the abolition of term limits, grabbing more power for himself. And while Chavez and his successor, Maduro, imposed new and damaging policies on Venezuelas economy, they enriched themselves at the expense of their people. Chavezs net worth was estimated to be more than $1 billion when he died in 2013, and his family had partnered with criminals to skim $100 billion from the national economy. Nowadays, Chavez’s family members and those of Maduro flaunt wealth estimated to be in the billions , wealth thats been sucked out of the Venezuelan economy over the years. Chavezs former bodyguard-turned-treasurer has admitted to receiving more than $1 billion in bribes. These private fortunes are the corrupt legacy of populists who promised to spread the nations wealth more widely. When you look at Venezuela over the past 20 years, you see the result of leaders who were sure that they knew better how to manage an economy than millions of consumers and producers. These government experts tried to dictate prices and currency values, as well as what is produced and by whom. They thought they could manage an incredibly complex economy, down to the last detail. They failedas all government management is prone to when it becomes more complex. And what is worse, when the failures became clear, Chavez and Maduro didnt change coursenor did they learn a lesson. Instead, at every step, they doubled down. The result was a complete collapse of the economy and the nation in a disaster that is impoverishing millions. We should all be able to see this collapse for what it isand commit to not repeat these terrible mistakes. A version of this column originally appeared in Spanish at Univision.com."
Economic Freedom Is the Way Out of Extreme Poverty,www.szone.us,@Heritage,04-07-2019,2019,4,http://www.szone.us/showthread.php?p=248267,"Economic Freedom Is the Way Out of Extreme Poverty On 04.05.19 08:17 AM posted by Patrick Tyrrell A recent report by McKinsey Global Institute contains a startling fact. From 1990 through 2013, an estimated 1,122,000,000 people escaped extreme povertydefined as subsisting on less than $1.90 per dayin the 71 developing countries covered by the report. Of those individuals, an estimated 1,057,000,000about 95 percentlived in just 18 countries. Interestingly, these are the 18 countries that the report labels outperforming emerging economies, based on their rapid and sustained economic growth. Two of the outperformers, China and India, account for most of those escaping poverty. Thats not surprising given their vast populations. But the other 16 outperforming nations account for the vast majority (158 million people) of the rest, who now enjoy greater prosperity and hope for the future. Besides sharing a history of rapid and sustained economic growth, the 18 outperforming countries tend to have one other thing in common: They have expanded their degree of economic freedom far more, on average, than the 53 countries defined by the report as middlers and underperformers. We measured this using data from the very first year that a country was scored in The Heritage Foundations Index of Economic Freedom, *which,*depending on the country, was between 1994 and 2001. We also took index data from 2013, the year that McKinsey provided numbers on individuals escaping poverty since 1990. The 18 countries that accounted for 95 percent of the more than 1 billion people escaping from extreme poverty from 1990 to 2013 increased their Index of Economic Freedom scores by an average of 7.14 points through 2013, outpacing the average of 53 countries that fit the criteria of middlers or underperformers for having sluggish economic growth. The middler/underperformer countries did only half as well in promoting economic freedom. It just goes to show that the people who are empowered by policies that expand their economic freedom have the best chance of escaping extreme poverty."
"The US Economy Beat the Experts by Nearly 20,000 Jobs in March",www.szone.us,@Heritage,04-07-2019,2019,4,http://www.szone.us/showthread.php?p=248266,"The US Economy Beat the Experts by Nearly 20,000 Jobs in March On 04.05.19 09:34 AM posted by Timothy Doescher The U.S. economy is strong and growing, according to the latest jobs report. The Bureau of Labor Statistics on Friday released a positive jobs report on March, showing gains of 196,000 jobs, after only 20,000 jobs were created in February. All the while, the U.S. continues to boast an almost record low unemployment rate and rising wages for workers. Notable details of the March jobs report showed the unemployment rate held steady at 3.8 percent in March, and the labor force participation rate was essentially unchanged. In addition, the U-6 unemployment number, which measured both discouraged workers who arent currently looking for work as well as those holding jobs part time for economic reasons, also held at 7.3%. In addition, the African-American unemployment rate fell from 7% in February to 6.7% in March, teenage unemployment fell from 13.4% to 12.8%, and adult female unemployment fell from 3.4% to 3.3%. Job numbers from January were revised up from +311,000 to +312,000, and the low 20,000 jobs created in February were revised up to +33,000. With these revisions, employment gains in January and February combined were 14,000 more than previously reported. After factoring in these revisions, gains have averaged 180,000 jobs per month over the last three months. Wages also continued rising. In March, average hourly earnings for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls rose by 4 cents to $27.70, following a 10-cent gain in February. Over the past 12 months, average hourly earnings have increased by 3.2%. Continuing with the momentum, in a separate report released earlier this week, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that initial jobless claims not only beat expert predictions, but they havent been this low in nearly 50 years. So where were the jobs gained and lost? Health care: +49,000 jobs. Professional and Technical Services: +34,000 jobs. Food Services and Drinking Places: +27,000 jobs. Construction: +16,000 jobs. Mining: +2,000 jobs. Manufacturing: -6,000 jobs. While there has been a net gain of 466,000 manufacturing jobs since President Donald Trump took office, last months manufacturing numbers present a bit of concern, given the primary losses occurred in the motor vehicle and parts sector. Trump says he is imposing tariffs in order to save manufacturing jobs, and many of his supporters believe he is right to do this. Some believe it is a brilliant negotiation tactic. But history shows that tariffs do nothing but kill jobs . While this is certainly not a trend in the jobs numbers, it would be a shame if this continued, and the great progress we have made over the last few years dissipates because of needless trade tariffs.
