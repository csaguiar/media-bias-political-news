Dear Amy,
My marriage is not a particularly happy one. My wife and I were both older when we met and running out of time to have children, so we probably settled.
My wife presented herself to me for years as someone with a strong moral character. She demonstrated that she had class, but when we married, she turned into a whining, nagging, disrespectful (in public, to me), and selfish person almost overnight.
Recently, she threw a tantrum hours after a close family member of mine had tragically passed away. (It ruined her plans for the day!)
I realized she will never change back to the old her. This is it.
My oldest child senses something is amiss and has become super clingy toward me. We spend wonderful precious time together every evening. I feel as though taking this away from her is selfish on my part and that I should just suck it up. My girl just needs her father. Every day.
Counseling has been a waste of time. She is constantly on the verge of a meltdown based on everyday little things, and has no resilience. This is a learned behavior and not a physical condition (i.e. postpartum depression). She won't go to therapy or a doctor, anyway.
I am sorta done. I don't want to be with her anymore.
What is the conventional wisdom on staying together for the kids?
— Stuck
The conventional wisdom is that you should try mightily to repair your marriage — for the sake of the entire family (and that includes you) before you declare yourself ""done.""
I can't say whether staying together for the ""sake of the kids"" works, or whether it would work for your children. Every family has a different dynamic. But children never benefit from living in a combative household. Your daughter may be clinging to you because she senses that you are on your way out. Or she is clinging to you because you offer her a safe haven from your wife's volatility.
When you accuse your wife of not having ""class,"" it is a bit of a hot button, because this ""class"" concept is a tricky one. It is appropriate (and ""classy"") to review your own behavior to see what you might do differently to increase the harmony in your household, and to take ownership for your own failings.
You also need to get a handle on your own emotions. You obviously have lost respect for your wife. You are very angry and resentful. You feel she has deceived you. You say that she is refusing counseling or that counseling doesn't ""work"" for her — but what about you? Counseling could help you to clarify your options and intentions.
Yes, your kids benefit greatly from their daily Daddy time. But divorce does not mean that you will disappear from your kids' lives. If you and your wife split, they might do best with you as the primary parent.
Dear Amy,
Can you comment on this sort of rudeness?
On a 2½ hour plane ride, the nicely dressed, middle-aged woman next to me continually snorted her ""mucus"" back up her nose.
She needed to blow her nose badly, but chose this ""solution"" instead. Most grade-school children have better manners. Unbelievable!
I thought of sweetly telling her, ""Honey, if you go into the bathroom, there is tissue in there so you can blow your nose and you won't have to keep doing that,"" but I chickened out.
What should I have done?
— Flabbergasted
Many people experience allergy attacks or other sinus problems during a flight. Dismissively addressing a stranger as ""Honey,"" is not cool (although it's totally cool to do it in your head). Good for you that you restrained yourself.
One polite response would have been for you to say, ""Can I help you to get a tissue?"" This could prompt her to take care of it.
Then it's time to reach for those handy earbuds.
Dear Amy,
""Reluctant Wedding Guest"" was upset to be invited to an out-of-town wedding, but not invited to ancillary events (outside of the wedding).
I don't get it. People hosting a wedding are not obligated to provide additional entertainment for their guests. The rehearsal dinner, for instance, is for the wedding party — not all of the guests.
— Upset
As weddings become ever-more elaborate, guests' expectations seem to have expanded, too. Mature and polite guests find ways to entertain themselves, without burdening the wedding hosts.

Should I forgive them? By Carolyn HaxWashington Post Writers Group Saturday Apr 6, 2019 at 12:01 AM
Adapted from a recent online discussion.
Dear Carolyn,
My former best friends treated me horribly in the year after my divorce and stopped speaking to me completely several months ago. I have heard through the grapevine that they would like to apologize, and I would like to hear them out, but I'm not sure what I want out of it. I miss them terribly, but I am still really hurt and I'm not sure it's possible to go back to ""the way things were."" I am scared that they will hurt me again.
They are still very close with my ex, who was emotionally abusive to me, and it stings quite a bit to hear about vacations they take together. How do I decide what I want out of the relationship and how to move forward?
— Rebuilding
There is nothing to get out of anything here, at least not yet. Grapevine developments are not developments.
And who discusses this publicly, anyway? Doesn't a person who wants to apologize simply contact you and issue said apology?
That alone makes them sound like weak approximations of friends at best, without even factoring in the ""treated me horribly when my life went to crap"" stuff.
And the ""friends with my emotionally abusive ex"" stuff. The only reason I'm not telling you to celebrate being well rid of all of these people is that emotional abuse that's unmistakable within a couple can be invisible to those outside it. And if their loyalties were to you both, then they can legitimately have been suckered by the stronger side in a he-said-she-said campaign.
Sigh.
If they do approach you, OK, then listen to what they say. Maybe the proper response to them will be so obvious in the moment that any time spent preparing one in advance will have been wasted. This could go both ways, too — that their words are so enlightened and healing that forgiveness and acceptance are automatic, or their words are so self-serving that you look at your watch and ask if that's it.
If it's in between and you're not sure, then thank them and say you need time to think.
Really, though — this is all an answer that's still waiting for its question to happen.
You can't go wrong with living your life as if it won't happen, and then being pleasantly surprised when it does.
Or, I suppose mildly annoyed or amused when it does. Again: Stepping back a bit, doesn't this all seem a little more high-schooley than befits people old enough to be married and divorced? ""They"" would like to apologize? You ""heard""? What, after they all go to the bathroom together at the dance?
The hard work of starting over might not sound appealing to you now, but I suspect in time you'll find the results to have been worth whatever it took.

INDIANAPOLIS — Jason Tatum scored 22 points and Gordon Hayward added 21 in his return to Indianapolis on Friday night, leading the Boston Celtics to a crucial 117-97 victory over the Pacers.
The Celtics broke a tie with Indiana for the No. 4 seed in the East and essentially took a two-game lead in the chase for homecourt advantage because they won the season series, 3-1 — giving them the tiebreaker, too. Boston also is building postseason momentum with three straight wins and five in their last six games.
Indiana's two-game winning streak ended. Myles Turner led the Pacers with 15 points and seven rebounds, while Domantas Sabonis and Tyreke Evans each scored 12.
But the Celtics exposed some problems that could become major concerns for the Pacers when the teams likely meet in a first-round, best-of-seven series, starting next weekend.
They repeatedly broke down Indiana's defense — and it showed right from the start.
They jumped to a 10-3 lead out of the gate and opened the second quarter with seven straight points to turn a 27-24 deficit into a 31-27 lead.
It was only the start. An 8-0 run made it 52-40 and when the Celtics scored the final four points of the half, they led, 58-47.
Indiana didn't counterpunch much in the second half, either. Wesley Matthews opened the third quarter with a 3-pointer to cut the deficit to eight. When Tyreke Evans made one of two free throws with 4:50 left, the Pacers were within 74-65.
Boston answered with a 12-3 run to make it 86-68 and the Pacers never recovered.
Tip-ins
Celtics: Hayward went 9 of 9 from the field and 3 of 3 at the free-throw line. He also had four rebounds in his homecoming. ... Kyrie Irving had 17 points and six assists, while Al Horford, Aron Baynes and Marcus Morris each scored 11 points. ... Baynes also had 11 rebounds. Tatum and Horford each had seven rebounds. ... The Celtics won despite playing without Jaylen Brown (back spasms). ... The Celtics shot 52.2% from the field.
Pacers: Wesley Matthews scored 10 points after missing the previous two games with a strained right hamstring. ... Doug McDermott and Aaron Holiday each scored 11 points and Thaddeus Young had 10. ... Indiana was 10 of 23 on 3s and shot 41.3% from the field. ... The Pacers suffered their worst road loss of the season at Boston and their third-worst home loss this season to the Celtics. ... Point guard Darren Collison missed his third straight game with an injured groin.
Up next
Celtics: Head home to play Orlando on Sunday.
Pacers: Host Brooklyn on Sunday, chasing a second straight season sweep.

Gone in 6 minutes: A passenger jet's final journey,www.providencejournal.com,The Associated Press,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.providencejournal.com/zz/news/20190405/gone-in-6-minutes-passenger-jets-final-journey?rssfeed=true,"Gone in 6 minutes: A passenger jet's final journey Friday Apr 5, 2019 at 10:27 PM Ethiopian authorities issued a preliminary report Thursday of the final minutes before the March 10 crash that killed 157 people.
From nearly the moment they roared down the runway and took off in their new Boeing jetliner, the pilots of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 encountered problems with the plane.
Almost immediately, a device called a stick shaker began vibrating the captain's control column, warning him that the plane might be about to stall and fall from the sky.
For six minutes, the pilots were bombarded by alarms as they fought to fly the plane, at times pulling back in unison on their control columns in a desperate attempt to keep the huge jet aloft.
Ethiopian authorities issued a preliminary report Thursday on the March 10 crash that killed 157 people. They found that a malfunctioning sensor sent faulty data to the Boeing 737 Max 8's anti-stall system and triggered a chain of events that ended in a crash so violent it reduced the plane to shards and pieces. The pilots' struggle, and the tragic ending, mirrored an Oct. 29 crash of a Lion Air Max 8 off the coast of Indonesia, which killed 189 people.
The anti-stall system, called MCAS, automatically lowers the plane's nose under some circumstances to prevent an aerodynamic stall. Boeing acknowledged that a sensor in the Ethiopian Airlines jet malfunctioned, triggering MCAS when it was not needed. The company repeated that it is working on a software upgrade to fix the problem in its best-selling plane.
""It's our responsibility to eliminate this risk,"" CEO Dennis Muilenburg said in a video. ""We own it, and we know how to do it.""
Jim Hall, a former chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, said the preliminary findings add urgency to re-examine the way that the Federal Aviation Administration uses employees of aircraft manufacturers to conduct safety-related tasks, including tests and inspections — a decades-old policy that raises questions about the agency's independence and is now under review by the U.S. Justice Department, the Transportation Department's inspector general and congressional committees.
""It is clear now that the process itself failed to produce a safe aircraft,"" Hall said. ""The focus now is to see if there were steps that were skipped or tests that were not properly done.""
The 33-page preliminary report, which is subject to change in the coming months, is based on information from the plane's flight data and cockpit voice recorders, the so-called black boxes. It includes a minute-by-minute narrative of a gripping and confusing scene in the cockpit.
Just one minute into Flight 302 from Addis Ababa to Nairobi in neighboring Kenya, the captain, Yared Getachew, reported that they were having flight-control problems.
Then the anti-stall system kicked in and pushed the nose of the plane down for nine seconds. Instead of climbing, the plane descended slightly. Audible warnings — ""Don't Sink"" — sounded in the cockpit. The pilots fought to turn the nose of the plane up, and briefly they were able to resume climbing.
But the automatic anti-stall system pushed the nose down again, triggering more squawks of ""Don't Sink"" from the plane's ground-proximity warning system.
Following a procedure that Boeing reiterated after the Lion Air crash, the Ethiopian pilots flipped two switches and disconnected the anti-stall system, then tried to regain control. They asked to return to the Addis Ababa airport, but were continuing to struggle getting the plane to gain altitude.
Then they broke with Boeing procedure and returned power to controls including the anti-stall system, perhaps hoping to use power to adjust a tail surface that controls the pitch up or down of a plane, or maybe out of sheer desperation.
One final time, the automated system kicked in, pushing the plane into a nose dive, according to the report.
A half-minute later, the cockpit voice recording ended, the plane crashed, and all 157 people on board were killed. The plane's impact left a crater 10 meters deep.
The Max is Boeing's newest version of its workhorse single-aisle jetliner, the 737, which dates to the 1960s. Fewer than 400 Max jets have been sent to airlines around the world, but Boeing has taken orders for 4,600 more.
Boeing delivered this particular plane, tail number ET-AVJ, to Ethiopian Airlines in November. By the day of Flight 302, it had made nearly 400 flights and been in the air for 1,330 hours — still very new by airline standards.
The pilots were young, too, and between them they had a scant 159 hours of flying time on the Max.
The captain, Getachew, was just 29 but had accumulated more than 8,000 hours of flying since completing work at the airline's training academy in 2010. He had flown more than 1,400 hours on Boeing 737s but just 103 hours on the Max. That may not be surprising, given that Ethiopian Airlines had just five of the planes, including ET-AVJ.
The co-pilot, Ahmed Nur Mohammod Nur, was only 25 and was granted a license to fly the 737 and the Max on Dec. 12 of last year. He had logged just 361 flight hours — not enough to be hired as a pilot at a U.S. airline. Of those hours, 207 were on 737s, including 56 hours on Max jets.
Thursday's preliminary report found that both pilots performed all the procedures recommended by Boeing on the March 10 flight but still could not control the jet.
While Boeing continues to work on its software update, Max jets remain grounded worldwide. The CEO said the company is taking ""a comprehensive, disciplined approach"" to fixing the flight-control software.
But some critics, including Hall, the former NTSB chairman, question why the work has taken so long.
""Don't you think if Boeing knew what the fix was, we would have the fix by now?"" he said. ""They said after the Lion Air accident there was going to be a fix, yet there was a second accident with no fix. Now, in response to the worldwide reaction, the plane is grounded and there is still not a fix."" Never miss a story

Could the Keto diet lead to a bad heart rhythm? - News,www.providencejournal.com,Nicole Villalpando nvillalpando@statesman.com,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.providencejournal.com/news/20190405/could-keto-diet-lead-to-bad-heart-rhythm,"By Nicole Villalpando nvillalpando@statesman.com 1:47 PM Apr 5, 2019 at 1:50 PM
Last month the American College of Cardiology published a study that tied eating a diet low in carbohydrates with a heart problem called atrial fibrillation, or AFib.
Low-carb diets such as the Keto diet or the Paleo, Atkins or South Beach diets before are known for fast weight loss as people decrease the carbs — and often increase the fats.
This study looked at 14,000 people from 1995 to 2016. The participants were asked to report their daily intake of food on a questionnaire and the researchers then estimated what proportion of their daily calories were made up of carbs.
Of those who did not have AFib when they enrolled, 1,900 people later were diagnosed with it. The researchers then divided participants into people who fit in what is considered the healthy range of 44.8 percent to 52.4 percent daily intake of carbs and people who were above that or below that.
The participants who were below the healthy range for carbs were 18 percent more likely to develop AFib than those with moderate carb intake and 16 percent more likely to develop AFib than those with high carb intake.
Why do we care about AFib?
AFib is an an abnormal heart rhythm that happens when the upper chamber of the heart no longer beats in a regular way, says Dr. Amin Al-Ahmad, a cardiac electrophysiologist at the Texas Cardiac Arrhythmia Institute at St. David’s Medical Center in Austin, Texas. Normally, the upper chamber beats and then the lower chamber beats. In AFib, the upper chamber no longer is organized electrically and it bombards the lower chamber with signals that results in the lower chamber beating irregularly and rapidly, Al-Ahmad explains.
It’s important because AFib can cause a fast heart rate, irregular heart rate and symptoms like shortness of breath, palpitations and tiredness. It puts people at risk for a blood clot in the upper chamber and stroke.
The causes are unclear, but it’s associated with increase of age, high blood pressure and other types of heart problems, he says.
Sometimes people don’t feel it or sometimes it sneaks up on them and they don’t notice that they are increasingly tired, he says.
To treat AFib, you might use a blood thinner to reduce stroke risk or medicine to slow down the heart rate. Doctors also might do an ablation to put catheters in the heart to cauterize the areas causing the AFib.
“It’s very treatable,” Al-Ahmad says.
“It’s not something you want to ignore for a long time,” he adds. See your doctor within a day or two, but if you are feeling poorly, seek attention right away.
The researchers in this study were very careful to say that they did not find a direct cause between low-carb diets and AFib, but instead found an association.
The problem with a study like this one, Al-Ahmad says, is that it relies on participants to remember what they ate and accurately record it.
It also assumes that what you are eating is the reason, when there might be other factors. “People who may be on that specific diet may also have a weight problem specifically associated with AFib,” he says.
“I would consider it to be interesting and perhaps useful to generate a hypothesis but not necessarily in any way indicting to that type of diet causative or even associated with AFib,” he says.
Al-Ahmad recommends thinking about reduction rather than elimination of bad actors such as sugar. Keto, though, is effective in losing weight and that weight loss might outweigh the harm you get from eliminating a food. If you can achieve weight loss with a more moderate approach, it will be better, he says.
“Anything on the extreme level is concerning,” he says. “Trying to achieve balance is more important.”"
Looking Up:Star clusters across the April sky - Opinion,www.providencejournal.com,Peter BeckerMore Content Now,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.providencejournal.com/opinion/20190405/looking-upstar-clusters-across-april-sky,"By Peter BeckerMore Content Now 1:44 PM Apr 5, 2019 at 1:46 PM
Mid-evening in early April is a fine time to catch four open star clusters with the naked eye, among the largest and closest star clusters to our solar system. At around 9 p.m., Coma Berenices is about half way up in the east; the Beehive Cluster is high in the south and about half way up in the west and are the Hyades and the Pleiades.
As noted in the last column, the red planet Mars is currently positioned smack dab between the Hyades and the Pleiades.
While all of these star clusters are visible with eyes alone if the sky is dark, binoculars offer a much more spectacular view.
Star clusters are groups of stars that are gravitationally bound, traveling the galaxy together. Their stars are believed to have formed in the same cosmic cloud (nebula). There are two sorts of star clusters. Open star clusters generally have less than a hundred members and are often relatively young as stars go. They are very numerous throughout the billions of stars making up the spiral arms of the Milky Way Galaxy.
Globular clusters may contain hundreds if thousands of stars, packaged much closer together than an open cluster. The globulars are much older and are scattered like a halo around the Milky Way’s central hub.
Coma Berenices is the name of a small constellation between Bootes and Leo; the star cluster makes up the major part of the constellation and is referred to as the Coma Star Cluster or Melotte 111. If you have a fairly dark sky, you may be able to make out cluster’s crude, triangular outline. The cluster spans about five degrees (in comparison, the Moon appears about a half degree wide). The stars are quite dim (only as bright as + 5th magnitude).
Interestingly, in the distant background is a vast cluster of galaxies, some them visible with a small to medium-sized telescope. The star cluster is about 288 lights years from the Sun; these galaxies begin at around 230 MILLION light years away.
The Beehive Star Cluster, also listed as M44, is within the constellation Cancer the Crab. Under dark skies it appears to unaided eyes as a dim, hazy patch, a degree and a half across. See it burst into stars when you train binoculars on it. The Beehive is estimated to be between 520 and 610 light years from us.
The stars of the Hyades trace a rough capital ""V"" and stands upright when seen in the western sky. The bright reddish star Aldebaran, at one end, is much nearer and not part of the cluster.
The Hyades are easy to see, a mere 151 light years away.
Most famous of these, however, is the Pleiades, to the right of the Hyades. The main stars of the Pleiades are fairly bright and the cluster is compact. It appears like a very small dipper. Also known as the Seven Sisters, about five or six are all most people can detect with eyes alone. The Pleiades are 444 light years away.
Both the Hyades and Pleiades are part of the constellation Taurus the Bull.
Many more star clusters are in easy reach of a small telescope. Your local library may have a constellation guide book with information on where and how to look.
Look for the crescent Moon this week leading up to First Quarter on Friday, April 12.
Keep looking up!

Online retail likely is responsible for much of this counterfeit reselling otherwise authorized channels would be more utilized. Then there are those who purchase counterfeits and resell them on decent online retail shops. It seems regardless of certifications, the important aspect about reliability for a manufacturer is floor space, online site depicting support info along with other specific things pertinent to their products and perhaps some documentation providing results for their parts under substantial load not pertinent to derating values."

Chambers Williams IIIFort Worth Star-Telegram 30 PM The Nissan Armada full-size sport utility, now in its second generation, returns for 2019 with new standard safety technology.
The Nissan Armada full-size sport utility, now in its second generation, returns for 2019 with a few updates, including new standard safety technology.
Now included on all trim levels are Rear Door Alert, Intelligent Cruise Control, Automatic Emergency Braking and Intelligent Forward Collision Warning.
There are four trim levels for 2019: SV (base price $46,790 plus $1,395 freight), SL ($51,590), Platinum ($59,690) and Platinum Reserve ($62,690), a new top-of-the-line model added last year. All of these come with rear-wheel drive, but four-wheel drive can be added to any trim level for an additional $3,000.
Also for 2019, the Armada comes with NissanConnect Services powered by SiriusXM, including an 8-inch multi-touch display, HD Radio, SiriusXM Travel Link with three years of service (SiriusXM subscription sold separately), Enhanced Voice Recognition, Hands-Free Text Messaging Assistant, and additional USB ports for all models.
Extras on the Platinum Reserve include Dark Chrome on the grille, door handles and outside mirrors; special 20-inch Dark Chrome wheels; two-tone leather seats with unique stitching; Black Quartz and premium wood-tone interior trim; and an embossed ""Platinum Reserve"" emblem on the lid of the center console.
The Platinum and Platinum Reserve models come with the Intelligent Rear-View Mirror, which uses a high-resolution camera at the rear exterior to transmit a rear-facing image onto a monitor built into the center rearview mirror. But there is a switch at the bottom of the mirror that lets the driver change between camera and standard mirror views.
This camera system eliminates blind spots in the rearview mirror image caused by such interior elements as headrests, body panels and large cargo items.
Armada's second generation is based on the architecture of the similar Infiniti QX80 luxury SUV.
The original Armada was introduced in 2004 as the Pathfinder Armada, and was built on the same chassis as the Nissan Titan pickup. It was assembled at the Nissan plant in Canton, Mississippi. Now, the Armada comes from the same plant in Kyushu, Japan, that has been assembling the QX80 since it moved into its second generation for 2011.
Ever since the midsize, seven-passenger Nissan Pathfinder was shifted to a car-based crossover format five years ago, the Armada is the only three-row, truck-based SUV left in the Nissan lineup.
Inside, there is seating for up to eight people, and it still has a conventional body-on-frame design rather than the unibody construction of a crossover. It's 1.2 inches longer overall than the first-generation Armada, but has a 2.1-inch shorter wheelbase. It's 0.6 inches wider and 2.2 inches lower.
The Armada can be configured for seven passengers by replacing the standard three-person second-row bench seat with two captain's chairs ($450 extra). That lowers the capacity to two in front, two in the middle and three in the rear.
We tested the 2019 Armada SV with all-wheel drive and the standard eight-passenger arrangement (base price $49,790). We didn't need the third row during our week with the Armada, but it can easily accommodate big kids or average-size adults.
For some trips, we did have two adult passengers in the middle row, and they found their seats to be quite roomy and comfortable.
The Armada is high enough off the ground (9.1-inch ground clearance for the SV, 9.2-inch for the other trims) that it can be a bit difficult to get into from outside, especially for short people. To help, there are steel side step rails with rubber pads on each side.
Armada competes in the full-size SUV class along with the Chevrolet Tahoe/Suburban and its siblings, the GMC Yukon/Yukon XL, as well as the Ford Expedition and Toyota Sequoia. Also in the mix is the Lincoln Navigator, which also is a direct competitor to the QX80.
All trim levels of the Armada come with a 5.6-liter Endurance V-8 engine, rated at 390 horsepower and 394 foot-pounds of torque. It's connected to a seven-speed automatic transmission. This powerful engine moves the Armada quite easily, and offers plenty of passing and towing power. Trailers up to 8,500 pounds can be accommodated.
EPA ratings are 14 city/19 highway/16 combined for rear-drive models, and 13/18/15 for four-wheel-drives. During our test week, with about 70 percent interstate highway driving, we averaged 16.7 mpg.
The now standard Intelligent Cruise Control on our Armada was very precise, holding the vehicle to the preset speed with little or no variation going uphill or down. Unlike some high-end vehicles, the Armada's cruise control can be adjusted up or down in 1 mph increments, and the driver can see the set speed on a digital readout in the center of the instrument panel.
For the second generation, the Armada got a completely new exterior similar to that of the QX80. Nissan says there was an increase of 20 percent in body stiffness, helping to enhance handling and ride comfort.
Corners and edges are more rounded than those of the previous Armada, and this vehicle sits up above most other vehicles, giving driver and passengers great outward visibility.
Among other standard features on our vehicle were heated front seats; a 13-speaker Bose audio system with navigation and an 8-inch color touch screen, satellite and HD radio, four USB ports (two are charge-only), Bluetooth connectivity, and Nissan Connect services; 10-way power driver's seat and eight-way power front passenger seat, both with two-way power lumbar adjust; cloth seats in charcoal color; leather-wrapped steering wheel and shifter knob; and keyless entry with pushbutton start.
We also had dual-zone front automatic climate control and rear climate control with rear controls; rearview monitor; side and rear privacy glass; and power outside mirrors with turn signals.
Other exterior elements include a black V-motion grille and standard LED low-beam headlights with halogen high beams and LED daytime running lights. Headlights are automatic on/off, and there are fog lights on the SL, Platinum and Platinum Reserve models (optional on SV).
At the rear, there are LED taillights. There are functional air intake vents on the front fenders. Chrome-plated electro-chromatic mirrors with memory, heat and puddle lamps are standard on SL and Platinum models.
The Armada has 16.5 cubic feet of cargo space behind the third-row seat, or 49.9 cubic feet with the third-row seatbacks folded down. We hauled some Home Depot purchases in the rear with the third row folded, and had lots of room for everything we bought. A power tailgate with an auto-closing feature is standard on SL and Platinum/Platinum Reserve models, but optional on the SV in the Driver Package ($600), included on our tester. It also brought front fog lights, auto-dimming rearview mirror, power-folding third-row seat, power tailgate, and trailer wiring harness.
There are also body-color front and rear bumpers; chrome trim on the grille, side-window moldings and door handles; privacy glass; dark-painted over-fenders; dark-painted roof rails; and front and rear parking sensors.
SV models have premium cloth seats, while leather is standard on SL and Platinum/Platinum Reserve. Three interior colors are offered — Charcoal and Almond (cloth and leather) and Tan (leather only).
Because this is a truly off-road-capable SUV, the all-mode four-wheel drive features low-range gearing with a two-speed transfer case for extreme trail driving. We didn't take our Armada on any serious off-road trails, but did explore some unpaved park roads, though.
Also standard are four-wheel antilock disc brakes with electronic brake-force distribution and brake assist.
Three wheel and tire combinations are offered, depending on model, either 18 or 20 inches. Our SV model came with 18-inch alloy wheels.
Besides the Driver Package, the only other extra on our SV four-wheel-drive Armada was the carpeted floor mat/cargo mat package ($315).
The exterior of our tester was a very nice Gun Metallic color (dark gray).
Total sticker price was $52,100, including freight and options.
Specifications
The package: Full-size, seven- or eight-passenger, five-door, rear- or four-wheel-drive, V-8 powered, body-on-frame sport utility vehicle.
Highlights: The Armada was redesigned for 2017 to mirror the premium Infiniti QX80 model on which it is based. A Platinum Reserve model was new for 2018, and more high-tech safety features were added for 2019. This is a big, premium family hauler with lots of power, a smooth ride, and a long list of available comfort, convenience and safety features.
Negatives: Can get pricey with all the extras.
Engine: 5.6-liter V-8"
"Tesla struggles to get its Model 3 to China, Europe",www.providencejournal.com,Faiz SiddiquiThe Washington Post,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.providencejournal.com/entertainmentlife/20190405/tesla-struggles-to-get-its-model-3-to-china-europe,"Tesla struggles to get its Model 3 to China, Europe By Faiz SiddiquiThe Washington Post 30 PM
Tesla deliveries fell sharply in the first quarter of the year, a troubling sign for investors as the electric vehicle maker was set to appear in federal court Thursday in a contempt case against its chairman.
The company's quarter-over-quarter deliveries fell to 63,000 vehicles, Tesla reported late Wednesday, 31% fewer than in the final three months of 2018.
Tesla cited a ""massive increase in deliveries in Europe and China"" and chalked the delivery troubles up to ""many challenges encountered for the first time"" in a statement detailing its first-quarter production and deliveries. The automaker declined, however, to specify the nature of the challenges or how it plans to catch up — on the heels of its long-promised $35,000 Model 3 and the announcement of the new Model Y crossover.
It was the first quarter Tesla delivered its Model 3 to China and Europe, both of which are expected to be major markets for the sedan billed as the company's first mass-market offering.
Tesla's stock plummeted more than 10% in premarket trading following the production and delivery numbers' release. Its stock price was down 9% around 10 a.m. Thursday.
The vast majority of the cars Tesla built from January through March were Model 3, making up 62,950 of the 77,100 vehicles produced, Tesla said. The remaining 14,150 vehicles were the Model S sport sedan and the Model X SUV.
But the quarter's 50,900 Model 3 deliveries fell far short of the 63,150 of the models customers received in the final three months of 2018, and in the third quarter, when the company delivered 56,065, according to Tesla's figures. Analysts had predicted Tesla would come closer to replicating third-quarter results, but the quarterly delivery figure fell short of even their tempered expectations.
Tesla warned not to view vehicle deliveries as a reflection of its broader financial picture; its quarterly earnings remained unreported.
But the company warned its finances would take a hit amid the delivery challenges and price changes. Still, Tesla said, it had ""sufficient cash on hand,"" indicating it would not need to raise money.
Tesla chairman Elon Musk, whose attorneys were set to appear in federal court Thursday as the Securities and Exchange Commission tries to persuade a judge to hold him in contempt over unauthorized tweets, alluded to the delivery problems in the company's last quarterly earnings call, Tesla noted.
Tesla's ""issue actually with Europe and China is 'how do we get the cars made and on a boat as such that it reaches customers before end of quarter and we don't have a massive number of cars on the water?'"" Musk said. ""That's our biggest challenge.""
While Tesla has plans to begin building vehicles in China for its burgeoning market there, the company says the fact that it has only a single Bay Area factory has led to logistical challenges.
More than 10,000 vehicles were en route to customers at quarter's end, Tesla said. Never miss a story

Car Doctor: Corrosion on rims may cause tires to leak,www.providencejournal.com,John PaulSpecial to The Journal,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.providencejournal.com/entertainmentlife/20190405/car-doctor-corrosion-on-rims-may-cause-tires-to-leak,"Car Doctor: Corrosion on rims may cause tires to leak By John PaulSpecial to The Journal Friday Apr 5, 2019 at 9:30 PM
Q: I have a Ford Flex with relatively new Firestone tires. Ever since I purchased them, I need to add air about once a week. The old tires were on the car for 49,000 miles. Other than during oil changes and tire rotations, I never added air to the tires.
I have had the tires checked by the store that put them on and they said everything is fine with the tires and it must be the rims. They gave me two suggestions: buy four new, very expensive wheels or put air in the tires each month. If it is the wheels, why didn’t they leak before the new tires were installed?
A: It is possible that there is some corrosion around the rim. The old tires, over time, seal themselves to the rims. When the tires were broken down and removed from the wheels, that natural seal was broken. At this point, I would have the tires “broken-down” and the rims cleaned, inspected and sealed with a commercial tire/wheel sealer.
Years ago, when cars had steel wheels and hubcaps, we rarely saw this issue. But with alloy wheels, it is fairly common.
Q: I have a 2014 Outback with only 25,000 miles on it. Several times in the last few months, the engine got noisy, almost like my grandmother’s sewing machine. It doesn’t do it every time or even every day. My local repair shop looked at it but, at the time, it wasn’t making the noise. Any ideas?
A: If the noise only happens when the engine is hot and only on one side of the engine, Subaru has come up with some updated valvetrain parts. The repair is quite extensive and requires replacement of the valves, rocker arms and camshaft.
If this were my car, I would return to the dealer and see if the engine is still under warranty.
Q: My very old rusty Ford Ranger pickup truck is burning oil. I get a little oil smoke on start-up, but the engine is only using one quart of oil every 700 miles. The truck has 243,000 miles on it and I’m reluctant to put any money into it.
Is there anything I can do to eliminate the smoking?
A: The problem could be worn piston rings (very expensive) and worn valve guides and valve seals (not as expensive).
Considering the rust and high mileage, I don’t think I would make any costly repairs. Even though I’m not a big believer in engine oil additives, at this mileage and condition of the truck, I would try an oil additive. Rislone, Bardahl and Lucas all make additives that promise to help with oil smoke.
Q: I have a 10-year-old Toyota. When I come to a stop, I hear and feel a clunk. It almost feels like someone taps the truck from behind.
I have crawled under the truck and found nothing lose or broken.
Any thoughts on what could be wrong?
A: I would first start with making sure that the transmission mounts and cross-member is tightened properly. If everything looks good, I would then look at the driveshaft. In most trucks, the issue is that the slip yoke, which slides into the transmission, sticks. Lubrication will usually fix the problem. In some cases, the driveshaft will need replacing.
Q: I have a 2014 Chevrolet Sonic, which is a terrible car, but it is paid for and gets good enough gas mileage, so I plan on keeping it. The problem is that three times in the last six months the engine has cranked over and started with the key in the ignition but in the off position. Any ideas other than ghosts?
A: The problem is that the ignition switch lock is worn and needs to be replaced. In some cases, some of these vehicles had a recall. If your vehicle falls under this recall, it will be repaired at no charge.

Could Tesla's shift to online sales mean the end of your friendly local car dealer?,www.providencejournal.com,Robert ChannickChicago Tribune,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.providencejournal.com/entertainmentlife/20190405/could-teslas-shift-to-online-sales-mean-end-of-your-friendly-local-car-dealer,"Could Tesla's shift to online sales mean the end of your friendly local car dealer? 30 PM
DOWNERS GROVE, Illinois — Packey Webb Ford, a 57-year-old car dealer with an old-school jingle has bet more than $20 million on what it hopes will be the dealership of the future.
With car shopping migrating online and dealerships looking like the next bricks-and-mortar retailer poised to fall, Packey Webb built a gleaming 54,000-square-foot facility on the 10-acre site of a former junkyard in the southwest suburb of Chicago.
Opened in late 2017, the dealership features the usual floor-to-ceiling windows with panoramic views — and a surprisingly small showroom.
The service area, however, is a different story.
""You could land an airplane in here,"" said Webb Ford sales manager Kevin Schmieder, gesturing to the 32 bays lined up to accommodate what has become the dealership's undisputed profit center.
""If there are no dealers, you're still going to have to have these cars serviced somewhere,"" said John Webb, 52, a partner in the dealership started by his father, Patrick ""Packey"" Webb. ""That's where the future is going to be.""
Webb Ford has already outlasted many of Chicago's plaid-jacketed pitchmen from a bygone era, legends such as Harry Schmerler, ""Your Singing Ford Dealer,"" and Celozzi-Ettleson, ""Where You Always Save More Money.""
But surviving in the digital age will take more than a good slogan.
When Tesla recently announced it was shifting all sales online and winding down its stores, the electric vehicle manufacturer sent shock waves through the auto industry, signaling perhaps the beginning of the end for your friendly local car dealer.
No more low-budget TV commercials, no more kicking the tires, no more giant inflatable tube men beckoning from lots with unbeatable deals.
Touting cost savings and consumer preference, Tesla closed 10 percent of its 100-plus stores before putting the brakes on additional downsizing.
Last year, four out of five buyers who ordered the Model 3 — Tesla's lowest priced car — bought it online, without taking a test drive, the company said.
""Customers are becoming increasingly comfortable making purchases online, and that is especially true for Tesla,"" CEO Elon Musk said in a Feb. 28 email to employees.
While Tesla may be ahead of the curve, the bold move online has fueled broader industry speculation that auto dealers could soon join the growing list of traditional retailers — from booksellers to mattress stores — vanquished by a mouse click.
""Don't count on it,"" said Michelle Krebs, a Detroit-based analyst for Autotrader. ""I don't see everybody going to online car sales tomorrow.""
The entrenched interests of the nearly 17,000 new car dealers across the U.S., whose $1 trillion in annual sales are protected by state laws and franchise agreements with manufacturers, will no doubt be hard to bypass.
In Illinois, 713 new car dealers generated $38.3 billion in sales in 2017, according to the National Automobile Dealers Association.
Dealerships, whose ranks have been declining in recent years, are defending their turf against Tesla's move online, with the Illinois Automobile Dealers Association among several state trade groups considering legal action to challenge whether manufacturers can sell direct to consumers, according to its president, Pete Sander.
Even before Tesla's recent announcement, car dealers have waged a pitched battle in statehouses across the nation — with some success — to prevent Tesla from bypassing franchise laws and selling directly to consumers.
But with much of the car buying process already merging onto the information superhighway, Sander acknowledged dealerships will need to adapt to survive.
""I don't think we'll ever be able to stop online sales,"" Sander said.
Armed with smartphone apps, a growing number of buyers research, select, price and even locate their cars online before setting foot in a showroom, reducing both sales margins on new cars and time spent at the dealership.
In 2017, franchised dealers sold a near-record 17.1 million new vehicles, but the shrinking margins accounted for only about a fourth of gross profit, according to the National Automobile Dealers Association. Meanwhile, the smaller service and parts business brought in nearly half of dealership profits.
""The economics of the dealerships are becoming more and more difficult,"" Krebs said. ""One of the reasons dealers are beefing up service is because there's not a lot of money in new car sales.""
Started in 1962, Packey Webb Ford has survived wrenching changes in the auto industry, with its earworm jingle — a take on ""The Jones Boy,"" a jazzy 1954 hit by The Mills Brothers — still in heavy commercial rotation long after other high-profile Chicago dealers have been silenced.
Car buyers of a certain age probably can't shed the memory of Celozzi-Ettleson Chevrolet in Elmhurst, whose odd couple owners ended every TV commercial staring stiffly into the camera, holding a fistful of dollars and chanting their slogan, ""Where you always save more money.""
Then there was Harry Schmerler, ""Your Singing Ford Dealer,"" crooning ""Rock-a-bye your baby"" to entice customers to his showroom in Elk Grove Village; ubiquitous pitchman Linn Burton hawking cars during the late movie for Chicago dealer Bert Weinman, ""Your TV Ford Man,"" and faux newsboy Timmy endlessly screaming ""Extra! Extra!"" on behalf of Long Chevrolet in Elmhurst.
For a new generation of online car buyers, though, that hard sell often falls on deaf ears.
T. Wayne Maples, 53, a medical software consultant who lives on the North Side of Chicago with his longtime partner, Blake Young, 55, never heard of Webb Ford, or its iconic jingle, before buying a new 2019 Explorer SUV there earlier this month.
The couple, who moved to Chicago about a year ago from Fort Smith, Ark., located and priced the vehicle they wanted on the CarGurus app — an advertising vehicle used by Webb Ford — prearranged financing, took an Uber to Downers Grove and closed the deal without haggling.
""It took longer to get here than it has to do the paperwork,"" Maples said.
Both said they would have happily completed the deal entirely online.
""The test drive was really a formality,"" Young said. ""We pretty much wanted to buy it from what we knew online.""
The shift to online is taking place in the used car market as well. Carvana, a publicly traded Phoenix-based company founded in 2012, allows customers to browse, finance and buy used vehicles using a mobile app, with next-day delivery in more than 100 markets, including Chicago.
In lieu of a test drive, buyers have seven days to return the cars, a policy adopted by Tesla when it announced its online sales transformation last month.
Appearing on CNBC recently, Carvana CEO Ernie Garcia said returns happen less than 10 percent of the time, costing the company a couple of hundred dollars — far less than the fixed costs of a running a dealership to give customers a test drive.
""We think it's a pretty good trade,"" Garcia said.
Other automakers have toyed with online sales of new cars, including Ford, which launched a program last year allowing consumers to do everything but close the deal before picking up their car at a dealership.
A Ford spokesman did not respond to a request for comment on the progress of the program, but Webb said his dealership has not received a single order to date.
No matter how much of the car shopping experience eventually moves online, Webb remains skeptical customers could ever become comfortable with a web-only purchase.
""I still think they want to drive it, smell it, kick the tires at least once before they take delivery,"" Webb said.
And in any case, with his eight-figure bet on the future, Webb is already adapting.
""I don't see the dealerships going away,"" he said. ""You might not need as many showrooms, but you're still going to need service centers."" Never miss a story

US safety agency opens probes into Hyundai and Kia fires,www.providencejournal.com,Tom KrisherThe Associated Press,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.providencejournal.com/entertainmentlife/20190405/us-safety-agency-opens-probes-into-hyundai-and-kia-fires,"US safety agency opens probes into Hyundai and Kia fires By Tom KrisherThe Associated Press 30 PM
DETROIT — The U.S. government's highway safety agency has decided to open two new investigations into fires involving Hyundai and Kia vehicles after getting complaints of more than 3,100 fires and 103 injuries.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said Monday that it granted a petition filed last June seeking the investigations by the nonprofit Center for Auto Safety, a consumer advocacy group.
The investigations, one for Hyundai and the other for Kia, cover non-crash fires in almost 3 million vehicles from the affiliated Korean automakers. The probes cover the 2011 through 2014 Hyundai Sonata and Santa Fe, the 2011 through 2014 Kia Optima and Sorento, and the 2010 through 2015 Kia Soul. The complaints came from consumers and from data provided by both automakers.
One death was reported involving a Kia vehicle, according to the documents.
NHTSA had previously said it would incorporate the noncrash fires into a 2017 investigation that examined recalls of Hyundai and Kia vehicles for engine failures. It opened the new probes ""based on the agency's analysis of information received from multiple manufacturers, consumer complaints and other sources.""
Jason Levine, executive director of the center, said in a statement that it is long past time for the agency to investigate why so many Kia and Hyundai vehicles have caught fire when not involved in crashes.
""While it may be six months post-due, we are gratified to see NHTSA's Office of Defect Investigations open formal investigations based on our petition,"" Levine said.
The center contended that there are more noncrash fires in the Hyundai and Kia cars and SUVs than in similar vehicles made by other automakers.
Messages were left Monday seeking comment from Hyundai, Kia and the safety agency.
In documents detailing the investigations, NHTSA reported that it had received complaints of engine compartment fires, as well as fires involving other components including tail light housings, wiring harnesses, and light bulbs. Agency investigators sent information requests to both automakers in September and October of last year, according to the documents.
The investigation will look into how often fires happen, how many vehicles are affected and the safety-related consequences, the documents said.
Engine failure and fire problems with Hyundais and Kias have affected more than 6 million vehicles since 2015, according to NHTSA documents. So far, Hyundai and Kia have recalled about 2.4 million vehicles to fix problems that can cause fires and engine failures.
In addition, the automakers are doing a ""product improvement campaign"" covering another 3.7 million vehicles to install software that will alert drivers of possible engine failures and send the cars into a reduced-speed ""limp"" mode if problems are detected.
Just last Friday, NHTSA announced a recall of about 20,000 Veloster cars with 1.6-liter engines in the U.S. and Canada because fuel can prematurely ignite in the cylinders around the pistons. That can cause excessive pressure and damage the engine, causing vehicles to stall and in some cases catch fire.
But that's a different problem from what has caused the rest of the recalls since 2015.
In February, Kia announced that it would recall the Soul small SUV with the same-size engine due to fire and engine failure problems, but for reasons unrelated to the Veloster's issues.
Most of the engine failure recalls are for problems with Hyundai's 2.4-liter and 2-liter ""Theta II"" four-cylinder engines. Debris left from manufacturing can clog a port and cut off the flow of oil, causing the connecting rod bearings to fail. That can damage the engine block and cause oil to leak and catch fire.
Levine has said fire complaints to NHTSA have come from across the country, including a death in Ohio involving a Kia Soul in April of 2017. Kia says the driver in that incident damaged the transmission by pushing on the brake and gas pedal at the same time, causing transmission fluid to leak and catch fire. It's not clear whether this death is the one cited in NHTSA's figures.

Ford reboots European strategy with revamped SUVs,www.providencejournal.com,Ellen Proper and Elisabeth BehrmannBloomberg,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.providencejournal.com/entertainmentlife/20190405/ford-reboots-european-strategy-with-revamped-suvs,"Ford reboots European strategy with revamped SUVs By Ellen Proper and Elisabeth BehrmannBloomberg 30 PM
Ford Motor Co. will roll out four plug-in hybrids and two battery-powered models in its latest effort to boost its loss-making business in Europe, where manufacturers face slowing sales and tightening emissions rules.
The U.S. carmaker said Wednesday it will offer a new compact Puma, part of a revamped SUV lineup that includes the Explorer and an overhauled version of the Kuga. The Puma, to be built at Ford's Craiova plant in Romania, will be available with a mild-hybrid variant.
The electrification effort, which lags more ambitious plans at rivals Volkswagen AG and Renault SA, comes amid speculation about the U.S. carmaker's future in the region. Ford, which employs some 54,000 in Europe, last month said it will pull out of the Russian car market and close three plants there. Detroit peer General Motors Co. sold its European Opel and Vauxhall brands to Peugeot-maker PSA Group in 2017 after two decades of losses.
""Ford in Europe isn't going anywhere but forward,"" Ford of Europe Chairman Steven Armstrong told reporters Tuesday in Amsterdam. ""This is Ford re-engineering itself for an exciting connected future and making electrification relevant to millions.""
At the event, Armstrong showed off a revamped version of Ford's best-selling Kuga, the European twin of the U.S. Escape.
Declining markets since last year are magnifying spending pressures on carmakers to force costs cuts, increase collaboration with rivals and consider mergers. Ford, which has committed to spending $11 billion by 2022 on electric cars globally, plans to return to profitability with a 6 percent margin goal for Europe, short of an 8 percent global target.
The U.S. manufacturer last month said it will cut more than 5,000 staff in Germany, after outlining plans in January that may include closing factories as well as weeding out slower-selling models. Uncertainty over Brexit is especially hurting ford in its biggest European market.
A U.K. departure from the European Union without an agreement would be a ""disaster"" for the company and the auto industry, Armstrong said in an interview with Bloomberg Television. Ford is prepared to reconsider its U.K. presence, which includes an engine and a transmission plant, in the event of a no-deal Brexit, he said.
Ford's presence in Europe has shrunk in the past decade-and-a-half. The carmaker sold Jaguar and Land Rover to Tata Motors Ltd. in 2008, and also sold off its British Aston Martin brand. Sweden's Volvo Cars went to China's Geely Automobile Holdings in 2010.
The company is shuttering a transmission plant in France, as part of its review that includes ""rescaling the footprint of the business."" Production of the C-Max people mover at Saarlouis in Germany will cease. Ford's passenger-vehicle business, with city cars like the Fiesta and an array of compact vans, has struggled with a lack of popular SUVs. Sales last year declined 3.5 percent to 970,000 cars.
To help generate savings, the Dearborn, Michigan-based company will cooperate with Volkswagen on vans, a profitable business where Ford is the market leader in Europe.
The collaboration could extend to autonomous cars or even sharing production platforms. VW, the world's biggest carmaker, has also said its electric vehicle technology was open to competitors in a bid to gain scale and save costs.
Talks to advance the project are ""progressing well,"" Armstrong said. Never miss a story

Roadshow: S. Korea takes steps to protect 'smartphone zombies',www.providencejournal.com,Kyle HyattRoadshow,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.providencejournal.com/entertainmentlife/20190405/roadshow-s-korea-takes-steps-to-protect-smartphone-zombies,"Roadshow: S. Korea takes steps to protect 'smartphone zombies' 30 PM
I don't know about you guys, but I'm terrified of looking at my phone for more than a second while I'm walking. It seems that in South Korea, many people have no such fear, and so some of them — smartphone zombies, as they're called there, or ""smombies"" — are blundering into traffic while they stare at their phones.
This is a massive problem for both drivers and pedestrians, and to help curb it, developers from the Korea Institute of Civil Engineering and Building Technology are getting creative, according to a report by Reuters.
To start, officials have installed a series of flashing lights in the pavement at a crosswalk in the city of Ilsan, South Korea. These lights are triggered by radar sensors and thermal cameras installed at the crosswalk.
If the flashing lights fail to get the attention of distracted pedestrians, there are also laser projectors mounted on power line poles, and even a GPS-linked app that sends an alert to the pedestrian's phone.
Even if all this doesn't work on the ""smombie,"" it should have some effect on the drivers approaching an intersection that looks like a Daft Punk concert, prompting them to slow down.
These may seem like extreme measures, but South Korea has seen a steady increase in the number of automotive-related pedestrian deaths in recent years. In 2017, more than 1,600 pedestrians died as a result of incidents with cars. So, when you look at that, the approximately $14,000 cost to outfit a crosswalk with this equipment isn't so crazy.

Test Drive: 2020 Soul delivers an enticing performance,www.providencejournal.com,Frank A.

AukoferSpecial to The Journal 30 PM
Not that anyone could have predicted it a decade ago, but the Kia Soul has not only survived, it has thrived — even as competitors fell by the wayside. Now, as a new 2020 model, it is poised for a growth spurt.
There is nothing quite like the Soul. It is basically a box with streamlining and styling cues, something like a small cargo van with comfort, performance and handling — not to mention a funky personality.
When it was introduced as a 2009 model, competitors included the Scion xB and the Nissan Cube. The Cube, with a sideways-opening rear hatch, never caught on and faded away. The xB, from Toyota’s youth-oriented brand, grew into a larger station wagon, then disappeared as well. Later, even the Scion name was axed. But the Soul soldiered on; in 2018, U.S. sales totaled 104,707.
Now in its third generation, the Soul presents a new face — actually, three new faces — to a broad range of customers from across the age and income spectrum. There are seven gasoline-engine trim levels, from the base LX, at $18,485, to the top-of-the-line GT-Line, which starts at $28,485. An all-electric model was to be introduced separately.
The GT-Line is unique in the lineup. Compared to the other trim levels, it presents a different front-end treatment and headlight positioning, a more powerful turbocharged engine and a seven-speed twin-clutch automatic transmission. The electric model has a unique fascia as well.
At the national introduction, Kia showed the GT-Line and the $22,485 X-line. The latter, along with all the other gasoline Soul versions except the GT-Line, is powered by a naturally-aspirated 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that delivers 147 horsepower and 132 pound-feet of torque through a continuously-variable automatic transmission (CVT). City/highway/combined fuel economy is rated at 27/33/30 miles to the gallon.
However, Kia calls its transmission an IVT, for intelligent-variable automatic. CVTs use a system of belts and pulleys to seamlessly multiply engine torque on its way to the wheels. They typically have no shift points, and some are criticized for sounding and feeling as if they are slipping, though some manufacturers use computer software to mimic shift points.
The Kia IVT has different innards, including a chain drive that results in what might be called a more natural feel — that is, one that is more familiar to motorists used to traditional torque-converter automatics with smooth or sometimes jerky shift points.
Whatever. The X-Line’s IVT shifts unobtrusively and presents no annoyance to customers used to their previous 1959 Oldsmobile Rocket 88. On the GT-Line, however, the transmission is a dual-clutch automatic, which essentially works like a manual gearbox except with two clutches that are poised to anticipate the driver’s next up or down shift.
That happens when the manual mode is selected and the driver uses the shift lever or the paddles on the steering wheel. The transmission uncannily knows what the driver plans, so the twin clutches engage and disengage in milliseconds for rapid shifts.
Unfortunately, for true enthusiasts — who probably would opt for a Mazda MX-5 Miata or a Volkswagen GTI anyway — the only manual gearbox available on the new Soul is on the base LX model. (Kia makes an excellent six-speed manual gearbox available on models like the exciting Forte5, which would be welcome on the GT-Line Soul as well.)
Whatever. In its position in the marketplace, with all prices well below the $36,000 average price of a new car these days, the 2020 Soul delivers a range of enticing performance models.
Kia thinks that practical-minded customers, who are usually older, will opt for the X-Line for everyday driving, and even for bumming around in moderately challenging boondocks, even though no Soul has all-wheel drive.
The GT-Line exists for those who want the torque of a turbo for stoplight sprints and a bit of excitement on those twisting mountain roads, although, as mentioned, the six-speed manual would be the choice if it were available.
Just an inch shy of 14 feet long, the Soul has midsize sedan passenger space, full-size car luggage space, a rewarding throttle response, and supportive and comfortable front bucket seats.
Bottom line: The 2020 Kia Soul GT-Line, with its $28,485 price tag, delivers a good-handling, nice-riding vehicle.
If only a $200,000-plus vehicle gets your juices flowing, the Soul is not for your soul. But if your orientation is toward a not-as-attractive complete package for not a lot of bucks, take a look.

"Auto Bits: General Motors, Ford, and Jeep trumpet their American EV factory plans",www.providencejournal.com,More Content Now,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.providencejournal.com/entertainmentlife/20190405/auto-bits-general-motors-ford-and-jeep-trumpet-their-american-ev-factory-plans,"Auto Bits: General Motors, Ford, and Jeep trumpet their American EV factory plans 31 PM
Three of America’s largest auto producers announce significant electric vehicle factory plans in the United States.
Jeep beat General Motors and Ford to the punch. In March, Jeep announced plans to prepare its U.S. factories for electric vehicle manufacturing. Jeep did so at the Geneva (Switzerland) auto show. What better place to announce your American factory plans? Having been caught a little behind the curve, Both Ford and General Motors announced their electric vehicle production plans at the end of the month — on the same day.
Electric vehicles in America have been rolling along at a very slow pace since the dawn of the new EV era in America in 2010. Sure, the EV-advocacy media can write stories every week about huge leaps in production &#8211; by percent. After all, if you build two EVs in a month instead of one, your sales just increased by 100%. The fact is that there has never been an affordable EV capable of maintaining a pace of 2,000 units per month. Even Tesla’s Model 3 luxury EV still has not had a calendar year in which it sold more than 2,000 units each month. By contrast, vehicles like the Nissan Rogue and Toyota RAV4 crossovers sell above 30,000 units regularly. Ford builds as many as 80,000 F-series trucks in a good month.
EVs have thus far been mainly small cars, which the buying public has been moving away from for years. That will change soon. Automakers are finally getting around to building affordable crossover EVs, and in the near future, one automaker will decide to go big and produce an affordable EV crossover we actually want in high volumes. The only way that can happen is if the automakers have factories capable of building the vehicles. Up until now, none have.
Jeep’s announcement was part of an overall investment of many billions in U.S. manufacturing. Jeep included in that announcement that not just one, but three of its facilities would, ”... produce plug-in hybrid versions of their respective Jeep models with the flexibility to build fully battery-electric models in the future.” Jeep’s announcement was tied to the display of two of those vehicles in the flesh. Unlike most EV companies, Jeep didn’t announce its vehicles years before they would be ready. Instead, it drove them out and plugged them in.
GM’s announcement is also very meaningful. GM has led the affordable EV market with its Volt and Bolt pairing. GM has also had EV versions of its subcompact Spark and the company’s luxury division has had a couple of low-volume vehicles that were clearly testing the waters. GM says that it will invest $300 million in its Orion Township (Michigan) plant to build the next of its EV models. In a move that left some scratching their heads, GM idled its Volt factory in February. The Orion plant is where GM makes its battery-electric vehicle (BEV) Bolt. Clearly, GM is serious about moving toward battery-electric vehicles (BEVs) rather than plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) and EVs with gas range extenders (EREVs). Cutting its best-selling green car, the Volt EREV, shows that commitment. GM says it will build a new model based on the Bolt’s architecture. We would expect that vehicle to be the size and shape of Subaru’s Crosstrek and Jeep’s Compass.
Ford’s moves are more forward-looking. Although Ford’s C-Max Energi and Fusion Energi EVs did well initially, their sales have dropped to the also-ran pack. “We’ve taken a fresh look at the growth rates of electrified vehicles and know we need to protect additional production capacity given our accelerated plans for fully electric vehicles,” said Joe Hinrichs, Ford’s president, Global Operations. Ford is preparing a new platform from which it will build multiple new EV models in its Flat Rock Assembly plant in southeast Michigan. Ford also has a new electric performance crossover model it will import from Mexico.
By all indications, GM, Ford, and Jeep are positioning themselves to be producing a higher-volume of affordable electric vehicles in the coming two to five years. Coupled with Tesla’s already significant production capabilities, the U.S. looks to have a noticeably higher volume of EVs in its mix in the near term. That most are being produced inside America’s borders may help automakers when they begin to lobby Congress for extended taxpayer-funded EV price supports.

According to AAA’s latest survey, if gas prices remain low, 1 in 3 Americans (33%) would likely plan another summer road trip while 27% would increase the distance of one they already have planned.
Did you know
Every state has a law requiring you to slow down and, when possible, move over if you see flashing lights on the side of the road, says the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The federal agency recently revealed that several states are reporting an increase in drivers failing to move over and crashing into emergency responders, and traffic-related incidents continue to be one of the leading causes of death among on-duty law enforcement officers.
If you see an emergency vehicle stopped along a roadway with flashing lights, first, you should immediately slow down. Then move over if you can safely do so; and lastly switch to a lane that’s not immediately next to the emergency vehicle, if possible. Never miss a story

Don't expect car ownership to become obsolete,www.providencejournal.com,Leonid BershidskyBloomberg,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.providencejournal.com/entertainmentlife/20190405/dont-expect-car-ownership-to-become-obsolete,"Don't expect car ownership to become obsolete 30 PM
It's quite likely that carmakers and officials who regulate them are laboring under an important misconception. Car ownership isn't really receding into the past, and the available evidence that today's young people aren't interested in owning cars has more to do with bygone economic troubles than with changing preferences.
The evidence began emerging a few years ago; in 2013, The New York Times trumpeted ""The End of Car Culture"" based on downward trends in car ownership rates and miles driven in the U.S. The number of young drivers appeared to be sliding, and this was blamed, in one news story after another, on millennials' supposed preference for renting and sharing over owning.
Big castles in the air were built on this, whole worlds of shared transportation in which car manufacturers don't sell their products anymore except to operators of huge fleets of autonomous vehicles. In 2016, John Zimmer, a Lyft co-founder, predicted that car ownership would all but die out in major U.S. cities by 2025. In its 2018 survey of car industry executives, KPMG wrote of a fundamental change in the car retail landscape driven by demand for ""more intelligent mobility solutions instead of owning a private car.""
But since at least 2015, academics have been warning that the data on millennials and cars have been contaminated by an important economic factor: the global financial crisis, which slowed down many young people's slog toward financial independence.
In a paper written that year and published in 2017, Nicholas Klein from Columbia University and Michael Smart from Rutgers wrote that only millennials in dire financial straits owned fewer cars than members of previous generations; those who achieved financial independence owned more cars than expected based on their incomes and wealth. ""We caution planners to temper their enthusiasm about 'peak car,' as this may largely be a manifestation of economic factors that could reverse in coming years,"" Klein and Smart wrote.
Some more recent work appears to bear out this prediction. And a new working paper from Christopher Knittel from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Elizabeth Murphy from the power generation company Genser Energy provides convincing proof that not only are millennials as inclined to own cars as previous generations were, but also they drive their cars more than baby boomers did at the same stage of life.
Knittel and Murphy found, using U.S. government data, that millennials own 0.4 percent fewer vehicles per household than baby boomers did. But controlling for socio-demographic variables including income and the family life cycle explains away this entire difference. Doing the same for vehicle miles travel data reveals that millennials are more active travelers than older Americans.
Millennials, Knittel and Murphy wrote, ""operate under many of the same constraints as prior generations, and they still have strong preferences for personal vehicles."" Most of the U.S. isn't really built for any transportation solution other than private cars. In Europe, where public transportation and car-sharing networks are better developed, various studies show that millennials are less likely to own cars than previous generations, but robust studies such as Knittel and Murphy's are lacking, so it's unclear whether, as in the U.S., most of the difference is explained by socioeconomic factors rather than preferences.
I've heard many young people say they choose not to own cars because of environmental awareness or the convenience of sharing options. But do they actually mean what they say - or is it simply that they can't afford to buy a car and would rather frame that reality as a choice? In one recent survey in Britain more than half of young car owners reported buying the vehicle for prestige. (This is a recipe for excessive borrowing, to allow young people to drive a car they can't really afford.)
Prestige, of course, is also a factor feeding the rising car ownership in countries such as India and China. Between 2005 and 2015, ownership has increased by an average of 13.2 percent a year in emerging Asia, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
There's nothing wrong with carmakers' exploration of new transportation modes such as ride-hailing and car sharing, and working toward self-driving vehicles more likely to be owned by taxi operators than households means staying on top of cutting-edge technology. It's likely that the younger generations' growing environmental concerns will eventually drive regulation changes that will force a shift toward electric vehicles.
It would, however, be a mistake to reconsider business plans as if consumer preferences were undergoing a radical change. Having a car of one's own provides, and will continue to provide, a degree of freedom that cannot be matched by any other transportation offering. Data do not bear out the expectation that people will give up that freedom for any reason except being unable to afford it.

"Roadshow: Genesis launches all-inclusive lease program for G70, G80, G90",www.providencejournal.com,Jake HolmesRoadshow,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.providencejournal.com/entertainmentlife/20190405/roadshow-genesis-launches-all-inclusive-lease-program-for-g70-g80-g90,"Roadshow: Genesis launches all-inclusive lease program for G70, G80, G90 30 PM
Genesis is the latest automaker to experiment with a subscription-style program for its cars. Genesis Spectrum will now allow shoppers to combine their lease and insurance payments together into one monthly sum.
Genesis Spectrum will be offered for the G70, G80 and G90 sedans. So far, it's available only at the brand's 45 dealer locations in Florida. Insurance to lessees will be provided by Metlife Home & Auto. Again, specifics haven't been announced, though Genesis says the insurance will provide ""competitive coverage"" with a $500 deductible.
The 36-month leases start at $489 per month with $2,699 down for the G70, $569 per month with $3,999 down for the G80, and $909 per month with $5,499 down for the G90. Although insurance is covered, Genesis also notes that taxes and registration fees are not included in the Spectrum payment.
The basic premise of Genesis Spectrum is similar to subscription products like Care by Volvo or Lexus Complete Lease, which intend to make leasing a car a simpler, one-stop proposition. Most competing programs combine lease and insurance payments, generally with shorter-than-normal leases. Some, like Care by Volvo, even allow for picking out and ordering your car online.
For Genesis, the Spectrum program is intended to make car shopping easier for customers by eliminating the need to secure insurance separately. ""More than anything, the Genesis Spectrum premise respects our customers' time, which is their most valuable luxury,"" Genesis Motor America chief operating officer Erwin Raphael said in a statement.
As with every Genesis model, cars leased through the Spectrum program also come with Service Valet, where dealers will pick up and drop off the owners' car for servicing, as well as standard luxury-carmaker perks like roadside assistance, three years of map updates and a Genesis Connected Services telematics subscription.

Taylor Lewis / 03/18/19 / American Thinker
In March of 2016, during the heat of the Republican primary contest, Josh Marshall, the tetchy founder of Talking Points Memo, offered an ominous augury about the raucous Trump campaign. “Someone will die,” he thundered, giving, at the time, the umpteenth warning about the violent effects of the real estate magnate’s aggressive rhetoric. “It may sound like hyperbole. But this is the kind of climate of agitation and violence where someone will end up getting severely injured or killed. I do not say that lightly,” Marshall warned his loyal audience.
I’ve thought about the piece a lot since Trump’s unlikely election and the Democrats’ slow descent into madness. Every new instance of liberal-concocted violence brings it back to mind, like a nagging reminder. Whether it’s James Hodgkinson’s attempted killing spree, Trump supporters accosted in public, or even hoaxed hate crimes, Marshall’s prediction might appear prescient, albeit in a backwards way.
But is it true that we’re living in a “climate of agitation”? A recent New York Times piece also seems to confirm what gringo expat Fred Reed observed not long after Marshall’s disquieted conjecture: that America “seems angry — quietly so, not sure what to do about it, but looking for someone to hit.”
In “No Hate Left Behind,” Thomas Edsall cites a study from political scientists Nathan Kalmoe and Lilliana Mason on the growing ease at which Americans are willing to employ violence against their partisan opponents. “Just over 42 percent of the people in each party view the opposition as ‘downright evil,’” Edsall despairs, unaware that one of his byline colleagues once suggested “good people can’t be Republicans.” The data only gets worse from there. When asked if their favored party loses the 2020 presidential election, “18.3 percent of Democrats and 13.8 percent of Republicans said violence would be justified on a scale ranging from ‘a little’ to ‘a lot.’”
One wonders the difference between a “little” violence and “a lot.” Perhaps a walloping with a bar of soap stuffed in a sock is seen as a small-beer beating compared to the guillotine or firing squad? Sure, there’s the difference in degree, but as any victim of domestic abuse can tell you, soft beatings inevitably turn hard.
Then there’s the question of ontological moral status. The researchers found that “nearly one out of five Republicans and Democrats agree with the statement that their political adversaries ‘lack the traits to be considered fully human — they behave like animals.’”
It’s a neat little coincidence that three years to the day of Marshall’s warning, Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota suggested President Trump is not human. (Her opinion on Jewish Americans is, we can assume, not altogether different.) And who says white papers never represent the real world?
The statistics are troubling, to be sure. And while our times may seem uniquely unhinged, they should be put in the context of history in order to be fully understood. The phrase “political polarization” is invoked, by my count, at least 400 times a day in major publications to describe our anxious political climate. Social media enflames our imaginations by presenting the very worst of human nature: risk-less musings about the existential threats posed by our political opposites. Politics has become less about bargaining over our collective life than a passion similar to the fiery devotion of European football clubs. National Review’s David French, in commenting on the Edsall report, worries that “partisan hate is becoming a national crisis.”
Saying there’s too much hatred in America’s air is like saying there’s too much salt in the ocean. The country was founded on partisan bickering, which occasionally turned violent. It’s narrow-minded to suggest we’re at a more perilous time in our history than, say, the Civil War or even the frequent riots of the ‘60s and ‘70s or the Galleanist bombings of 1919. The last guy who tried to wage a national bombing campaign only sent duds from his bumper-sticker-laden creeper van.
Aside from hyperventilating Hollywood types, who get an outsized amount of media coverage, and the discursive rantings on Facebook, we’re not quite at the point where neighbors turn on neighbors, kids turn on parents, brothers turn on brothers, all in a bloody free-for-all. Go to a supermarket on any given day and you’ll see all types of Americans quietly going about their business. Few people let the fear of mass shootings or terrorist attacks disrupt their plans. We have yet to see roving gangs of marauders targeting MAGA-hat wearers or Beto devotees.
America doesn’t have an anger problem so much as it has an anger-management problem. We’re a naturally het-up people. Sometimes that leaks out into scrums of fisticuffs. But, a lot of frustration that drives these physical altercations comes from a double standard. Those who go unpunished for aggression aren’t going to see the light and make peace with their ideological adversaries. One side gets a clear pass when it comes to acting on its frustrations, and it’s not the side Jussie Smollett tried to blame for his botched publicity stunt. When leftists haul off and slug conservatives, the media-driven outcry is not nearly the same as when the inverse occurs."

France is the home to great food, entertainment, culture and history. Sadly, it has also become a home to vandalism and the desecration of religious institutions and artifacts.
In particular, there have been a significant number of recent attacks on Catholic churches in France. A March 21 Newsweek piece by Brandon Coles lists several recent examples.
The Church of St. Sulpice in Paris, a Baroque masterpiece that broke ground in 1646 and was completed in 1830, and contains three paintings by the great French Renaissance artist Eugene de la Croix, was set on fire. Fortunately, no one was injured and no artworks were ruined.
In another incident, a statue of the Virgin Mary was destroyed in Houilles’s St. Nicholas Catholic Church, and an altar cross was apparently tossed onto the ground.
Lauvar’s Saint-Alain Cathedral was the site of broken statues of Catholic saints and a burned altar cloth.
The Church of Notre-Dame in Dijon was the casualty of vandals.
Nimes’s Notre-Dame des Enfants was vandalized, and consecrated hosts made from unleavened bread were torn apart. A cross was also desecrated with human feces.
The Vienna-based Observatory of Intolerance and Discrimination Against Christians in Europe reported that there has been a 25% increase in attacks on Catholic churches in 2019.
What is causing this wave of vandalism, arson and desecration of Catholic churches in France?
No one knows for sure. The Observatory’s executive director, Ellen Fantini, told Mr. Cole that while “there is a rising hostility in France against the church and its symbols, it seems to be more against Christianity and the symbols of Christianity.” There’s some suggestion it could be linked to extremist groups such as anarchists.
“These attacks are on symbols that are really sacred to parishioners, to Catholics,” Ms. Fantini said, adding, it’s “more than spray-painting a slogan on the outside wall of a church.”
Places sacred to Catholics and Christians have not been the only targets.
A memorial stone in Strasbourg, which symbolized a synagogue burned down by the Nazis in 1940 during World War II, was vandalized and knocked off its plinth last month. This followed the desecration of dozens of tombstones at a nearby Jewish cemetery in Quatzenheim, which were spray-painted with swastikas. (We have seen such desecration locally, too, sadly. At a Hebrew cemetery in Fall River last month, police found 59 gravestones defaced with anti-Semitic language and swastikas.)
On March 2, BBC.com reported that the number of anti-Semitic attacks in France had risen from 311 in 2017 to 541 in 2018, an increase of 74%.
France’s Muslims have also been targeted.
At a Muslim cemetery in Strasbourg in 2010, tombstones were vandalized (and also spray-painted with swastikas, as it happens). Meanwhile, a Muslim prayer hall in Ajaccio was burned down in 2015.
It is sad to see this in a country that championed the Age of Enlightenment, promoting free and unfettered intellectual inquiry that has immeasurably improved life across the globe. Those values include support for the free exercise of religion, and an acceptance of the idea that we need not agree with each other about matters of faith.
Western nations should keep striving to defend their admirable ideals by protecting people of faith, and their sacred places, from violence and vandalism.

NEW YORK (AP) — A representative for Mick Jagger says he has successfully undergone treatment, though no details were provided.
In a statement released Friday, Jagger's rep says he ""is doing very well and is expected to make a full recovery.""
Jagger thanked his supporters and the hospital that treated him in a tweet Friday.
""Thank you everyone for all your messages of support, I'm feeling much better now and on the mend — and also a huge thank you to all the hospital staff for doing a superb job,"" he wrote.
Last week the Rolling Stones announced they were postponing their latest tour so Jagger can receive medical treatment.
Jagger was told by doctors ""he cannot go on tour at this time"" and the 75-year-old Jagger tweeted, ""I'm devastated for having to postpone the tour but I will be working very hard to be back on stage as soon as I can.""

Trump has not spoken out against the new red flag laws so far as I know, yet Ted Cruize has jumped on the gun control bandwagon, and has worked to get nothing in return, only accepting further decimation of our rights, and bowing to the left over a law that targets innocent individuals whilst ignoring the need for due process.

But then you are what the NRA loves most, a shill who continues to funnel money into the NRA while they sit back and do NOTHING when new gun laws are passed and states CONTINUE to restrict Constitutional rights just like all the other RINOs in the GOP. The NRA is being run by the same people who went along with the Assault Weapon Ban and CALLED FOR BANNING the Bump Stocks.
But then I am sure you are nothing but a FUDD who has the same elitist attitude the Left has against anyone who doesn't go along without question. THAT is what you need to come to terms with Elmer."

It's a blight on his presidency and it's a horrible decision because it proves that the idea of banning guns after mass shootings isn't just a left/right argument, it's a matter of modulation. Instead of a shooting with two deaths banning gun X, now I get the impression that Republicans would do the exact same thing if it was 100 deaths."
