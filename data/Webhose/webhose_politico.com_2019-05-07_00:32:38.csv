Just because Trump is so bad, does not mean Biden is the key to change. He strikes me as someone who will embrace the old school status quo so if you are going to say HE would be as bad as Trump is far reaching delusion! He is lukewarm to tepid compared to red hot evil Trump.. no comparison but doesn’t means he really is the best candidate.. even IF he could oust Trump and though I agree with #votebluenomatterwho it is not to say we have much choice in the matter, Trump is forcing us to vote Biden for very good reason RED HOT RUSSIAN/WHITE SUPREMACY AND TYRANNY!! So I do say #VOTEJOETOGETRUMPANDREDSOUT2020 And the midterms in 2022 will rate him or whomever, in the confidence midterm - where the tide can finally move from 80 year old candidates going forward - a change in the guard so to speak for the younger to cut their teeth for a more progressive party candidate with new gen members, who can pick up the torch for Democracy, and the let the stark difference in social and political and economic platforms emerge from the old tired patriarchy, that will leapfrog us into the slow starting new Century, sorely needing oxygen ! Time is of the essence right now to get the REDS OUT FOR THEY ARE TRAITORS ALL BY CHOICE , COMPLICITY OR COVERUP.. that has been proven SO first things first!2020 is a war on Democracy we must fight to save from the very party attacking it!! PERIOD FULL STOP!!! Just like the 2016 RESULT SHOULD NEVER HAVE HAPPENED SO IS IT TRUE WE ARE UP AGAINST IT HAPPENING AGAIN IF WE DO NOT AT LEAST RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF BACKING THE BEST CHANCE TO GET RID OF RETHUG RIGGING OVER THE LAST DECADE FOR GOOD!! THAT IS JOB ONE FOR ALL CITIZENS TO CONSIDER BECAUSE A SPLIT VOTE IS THE BIGGEST ISSUE IN 2020 - NOTHING ELSE MATTERS IF WE CANNOT ACCOMPLISH A ONE PARTY STAND IN SOLIDARITY IN THE GENERAL WITH THE NOMINEE WE KNOW HOLDS THE CARDS SO YES JOE MAY STEP UP AND REPRESENTS THE BEST OF THE BEST OVERALL IN EXPERIENCE AND COMPETENCE (though wish it were Joe Kennedy, we do not have time for a NEW GEN, UP AND COMING THIS ROUND, KNOWING FULL WELL WE ARE LOOKING AT THE SAME RIGGING NEXT YEAR SINCE NO RED SEES THE NECESSITY OF PROTECTING THE DEMOCRATIC RIGHT TO A FREE AND CLEAR DEMOCRATIC ELECTORAL PROCESS! Democracy is inder attack! We are still wading in the weeds of the real swamp, turned cesspool for another year and a half longer - and we all need to think very hard about what 2020 represents - a baby with bathwater for change right now/then - or the only chance to fight to save Democracy by BIDEN as ONE! AT LEAST WE SEE THE NUMBERS SPEAKING! Reality check says MODERATE AND FIERCE EXPERIENCE COUNTS! The country calls for action to save the WH from the TYRANNY - i say that is numero UNO FOR BLUE RIGHT NOW! It may find us in a VOTE FOR NEW - OR VOTE BLUE NO MATTER WHO.. but one thing is clear for next year... WHO! DOES MATTER TOO! In the fight of our lives before swtching to more up and coming progressive policy from the left from whats left in damage control to deal with first! Gotta steer the ship in a Tsunami too remember... all in good tome and timing is everything! Do not miss the STEPS! The question is WHO BLUE, CAN SAVE US FROM THE WHITE NATIONALIST PARTY OF DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN TERRORISTS WORKING HARD TO BRING DOWN DEMOCRACY FOR TYRANNY!!! And the latter is our only chance in this constitutional crisis - RED are quickly ramping up the attack we watch day by day (so pray there IS a Democracy to vote with and FOR!!! No one can imagine a “NO VOTING ALLOWED ANYMORE” order by DIM Trump but it’s exactly what HE (AND REDS) want.. and. Will . Do. To. Stay. In. Power! BARR NONE!! Grrr We know that by now cause we have essentially been told a dictatorship is the ultimate goal of the BIGGEST Dying. OUT Patriarchy. Of. OLD WHITE Male. Dominance BY MISOGYNY AND RACISM/BIGOTRY/HOMOPHOBIA/Xenophobia ! WHO ARE NOW SQUATTING ILLEGITIMATELY IN THE TRUMP ADMIN AND RED PARTY GOP GAGGLE OF GOONS - IS A DICTATORSHIP HOLDING THE WH HOSTAGE AND WAGING WAR ON THE PPL EVERY F’G DAY!! SO WHOMEVER WINS THE PRIMARY IS OUR GUY OR GAL... FIRST THINGS FIRST!! AND JOE HAS THE KEY I’D SAY! GET RUSSIA OUT OF OUR OVAL OFFICE FIRST AND FOREMOST IS THE MISSION HERE!! MUST FORCE REDS AND THEIR RUSSIAN CROOK PUPPET - OUT OF POWER FOR LIFE MUCH TO THINK ABOUT HOW AND WHEN THE STEPS TO TAKE AND WITH WHOM IS NEEDED TO STEP UP FIRST, THEN NEXT GEN GETS AHOLD OF MUCH NEEDED EDUCATION STILL, LEARNING FROM THE BEST OF THE BEST BLUE PARTY CANDIDATES THAT JOE WILL HAND OVER THE TORCH OF DEMOCRACY WILLINGLY OR BY VOTE FOR THE SAKE OF A MOST IMPRESSIVE PARTY OF PROGRESSIVES TO FLY BY 2024! JUST LIKE ROME WAS NOT BUILT IN A DAY, EVERY MOVE STILL COUNTS 1 before 2 and 2 before 3 STEPS ARE PARAMOUNT AS WE NOW HAVE DAMAGE CONTROL NATIONWIDE AND INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS TO CONSIDER AND REINSTATE BACK TO SOME FORM OF DEMOCRACY IN TACT, AND. THAT. LADIES. AND. GENTLEMEN, boys and girls IS YOUR MISSION TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IS NEEDED NOW BEFORE PRETENDING THAT DEMOCRACY HAS NO DAMAGE TO ADDRESS BY THE ELDER STATESMEN WE NEED MORE THAN EVER FROM THE LEFT, IN CHARGE TO STEER THE AHIP BACK HOME, AND SHOW THE NEW GEN WHAT DEMOCRACY LOOKS LIKE IN FULL WORKING MODE, TO HAND OVER “IN ONE PIECE!” IMHO. 👍💪"

After the unprecedented blood letting of World War I there was a worldwide revulsion against militarism which most people in the USA agreed with and which Coolidge was politically astute enough to promote. As to the wave of prosperity which this article centers upon, perhaps in historical persepctive that was a bit exaggerated. Only about 10% of the American public it is estimated was involved in the stock market in the 20's, and while jobs were abundant they also for the most part didn't pay particularly well. With most economic historians agreeing that it was the discrepancy between the ability to produce goods of all types and the ability of most consumers to purchase them which ended in the debacle of The Great Depression."

It ended up costing Former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor his job via a PRIMARY. And House Speaker John Boehner was pushed out. Nevermind the 16 Republicans who wanted ""Comprehensive immigration reform"" with Marco Rubio being used as a token totem. I did not vote for McCain or Romney because they were no different than Bush 43, who I voted for twice. Bush had a real problem of leaving his base behind while he wilted under the Progressive rhetoric. Trump was a different beast. YES, BEAST.
