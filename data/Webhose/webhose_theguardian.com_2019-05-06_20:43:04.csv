The whale with legs shows how little we know about Earth’s fantastical past | Riley Black | Opinion,www.theguardian.com,charliefin79,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/05/whale-legs-earths-past-fossil-peregocetus-pacificus#127802171,Yeah yeah yeah ... observer effect.

The whale with legs shows how little we know about Earth’s fantastical past | Riley Black | Opinion,www.theguardian.com,Grumblebum McWombat,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/05/whale-legs-earths-past-fossil-peregocetus-pacificus#127803159,"I checked out the paper. It points out that they have similar fossils from the west African coast, which is another factor which leads them to favour an equatorial route across the Atlantic. As you say there are no equivalent northern fossils, so in the absence of those then yes, the evidence is leaning towards an equatorial route.
But then we only have a few fossils from Pakistan, Morocco and Nigeria on the eastern side of the Atlantic. Those were only found a few years ago, and it's clear that's not a complete record. If these critters were swimming (and walking) everywhere from Pakistan to Nigeria, I'm fairly sure some of them would have been swimming around present day France and possibly further north. I don't think it can be definitely called one way or the other at the moment. It's even plausible that they went both over on both routes. We'll probably have a clearer picture in another decade or two.
Re the saltwater crocs, that seems like a good analogy in terms of body plan and function. Figure 2 in the paper shows the size as roughly 4 metres from snout to tip of tail, which is in the same range as a medium-sized saltie. Not sure how they'd compare for mass. Being partly terrestrial would limit the amount of blubber they could carry, but hippos do quite well in that respect.
Anyway, they weren't big in the sense that modern whales are big. More like a bottlenose in size. Wouldn't swim as fast as a bottlenose, but probably had similar metabolic requirements."

Execution is muddled, the colour scheme and narrow mm’s a mere gimmick to camouflage shortcomings. On top of that, it is a derivative story, a nostalgic throwback that doesn’t so much pay homage to the old Italian masters of neorealism, but steals from them instead and then mixes in the magic realism of Fellini on top.
There was an equally flawed effort earlier last year with A Ciambra to relive the old glory days of Italian realism as well. It’s a good thing Sorrentino, Guadagnino and Garrone are around to keep Italian cinema alive."

"China hails 'progress' in trade talks, but US warns of 'significant' work ahead | Business | The Guardian",www.theguardian.com,msn.com,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/apr/07/china-hails-progress-in-trade-talks-but-us-warns-of-significant-work-ahead,"Negotiators meet again on Monday to resolve dispute that has cast a shadow over global financial markets. China said “new progress” had been made in trade talks with the United States as the two sides prepare to resume discussions next week to try to secure a pact that would end a tit-for-tat tariff battle that has cast a shadow over global markets.
In a short statement on Sunday, Chinese news agency Xinhua said the remaining issues would be handled through “various effective means”.
IMF chief warns of slower growth for most countries worldwide Read more
The office of the US trade representative said the latest round of negotiations that ended on Friday included intellectual property, or IP, forced technology transfer, non-tariff barriers, agriculture, services, purchases and enforcement.
The announcements were a rare glimpse into the talks about which the two sides have offered few details.
Chinese vice premier Liu He concluded three days of meetings with US trade representative Robert Lighthizer and treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin in Washington last week. President Donald Trump on Thursday said a deal could be announced in the next four weeks.
Last year Washington and Beijing slapped import duties on each other’s products that cost the world’s two largest economies billions of dollars and disrupted manufacturing and supply chains.
The United States is seeking reforms to Chinese practices that it says result in the theft of US intellectual property and the forced transfer of technology from U.S. companies to Chinese firms.
“Significant work remains, and the principals, deputy ministers, and delegation members will be in continuous contact to resolve outstanding issues,” the office of the US trade representative’s (USTR) added in its statement.
White house adviser Larry Kudlow, speaking on Bloomberg Television earlier in the day, said Liu was due back in Beijing after Friday’s talks, but the two sides would press ahead to resolve remaining differences by video link.
“There’s no let-up here, this is an ongoing process,” Kudlow said.
Washington also has demanded that Beijing curb industrial subsidies, open its economy wider to US companies, and increase purchases of US goods including farm and energy commodities to shrink the gaping trade deficit with China.
“We are making headway in a lot of areas. That includes enforcement, that includes IP theft, that includes forced technology transfers, ownership, cyberspace, commodities and all the rest of it,” Kudlow said. “Those are of course in the middle of the negotiations that are ongoing, but we’ve come further and farther than ever before.”
While some reform pledges by Beijing are largely set, including an agreement to avoid currency manipulation, an enforcement mechanism to ensure that China keeps its pledges and the status of US tariffs on $250bn worth of Chinese goods must be resolved.
The plan to continue the discussions was taken as a positive sign.
“The fact that they’re still talking - and talking positively about the discussions - suggests they both think they’re on the path to a resolution,” said Erin Ennis, senior vice president of the US-China Business Council, which represents firms doing business in China.

It does not take long to ruin a country.
One business cycle can do it.
And the Coalition has succeeded in doing just that.
No matter where one looks today, no matter the sector, the regulator, the governance or policy, the conclusion is the same.
Australia has quietly slipped from a liberal democracy run for the people to a ravening kleptocracy run for the white collar criminal.
The most obvious examples speak for themselves:
the energy sector is run by a government shielded gas cartel that is stealing many multiple billions every year from households and business;
the financial sector has lurched from appalling behaviour to castigation by royal commission to two months later being emboldened to attack regulators with impunity;
the mining sector long ago bedded down its rentier profits after rolling a prime minister and composing its own tax code;
small business is engaged in a gigantic wage theft enterprise run entirely around the margins of the mass immigration program;
the franchise sector is engaged in a gigantic wage theft enterprise run entirely around the margins of the mass immigration program;
the gig economy is engaged in a gigantic wage theft enterprise run entirely around the margins of the mass immigration program;
the tertiary sector is owned by international students that have destroyed pedagogical standards;
every sector has a lobby with media teeth that can bite pollies instantly;
housing markets have been horribly distorted by illegal foreign capital laundered with the blessing of governments;
regulators in every segment of the economy are overrun, underfunded, corrupt and captured;
a property obsessed reserve bank has destroyed its own mandate and has not gotten a single decision right since 2011;
governments themselves has completely lost due process, spewing pork and crazed ideas like village idiots;
the media is a realty-addicted parasite pre-occupied with culture wars and “businomics” that simply hides all of the above instead of holding it to account."

Newstart is not enough money to live on when it is the sum total of your income. It is meant as a supplementary income as you seek employment and are supported by your family.
If you are older (aging), single and have mobility issues, health and support needs, it is patently inadequate. It is ludicrous to think that we who rely on Newstart must swallow the system perception that it is enough for those of us unable to work.
It is time to acknowledge that there is a group of us who should be on the equivalent of the DSP until we are old enough to go onto the aged pension.

No matter how they choose to disguise it or manipulate the figures over a day, a year or decades to try to portray otherwise. Before an election they are a battler's friend. After an election they move to penalise those who they deem 'leaners'.
They stick to a philosophy that taxation is primarily bad for it reduces personal wealth, that services to community should only be minimally supported because the rich don't need them, that 'user pays' is always preferable to any burden or social responsibility to public services and that anyone who suggests the opposite to that philosophy is engaging in 'class warfare'.
So be it. It's time for them to be disarmed from that attack. A lot of us support increased taxation for social and essential services. We do not approve of individuals creating wealth from the disadvantage of others or the sense of entitlement that many of the Liberal supporters might have. If the right of politics can take aim at who they determine to be living in the age of entitlement, then it's fair to turn that around to argue that the entitled are actually those who benefit most from LNP philosophy.
How can it be so difficult to argue for an effort to claw back a lot of the inequality that has emerged and has continued to widen in recent years? The vast majority of voters are not in the top 10% of those who have benefited. How can arguing for better services and infrastructure by increasing taxation on those who are most able to provide it, be so derogatory? How do we allow the Liberals to win the argument about 'class warfare' when it is they that in reality enact it?"

“Flattening income tax reduces the tax take from high-income earners, which ultimately means either fewer government services or high taxes on middle and low-income earners if the government wants to maintain a surplus.
“Flattening tax rates will see an executive on $195,000 pay the same marginal tax rate as someone on $45,000 which is little more than the minimum wage.
“Instead of addressing stagnant wage growth and rising inequality, this tax cut for the top end of town will only make inequality worse.
“At a time when Australia is suffering record low wages growth and historically high inequality the government has proposed a radical plan to increase inequality.”

Melbourne (depending on north today) is the only team with any designs on finals going into the season who have given nothing to give fans hope todate. Despite this I still think they'll make the finals.
All six of last year's bottom 6 have all somewhat or substantially exceeded expectations. 5 of them could be in the 8 by the end of the round and if they're not (more likely) two of them will be in the top 3 undefeated. Even Carlton are as up and about as you could be whilst winless.
As it is, I'd have west coast in the box seat and clearly with Collingwood's measure as it stands. Behind them are the cats and giants who play next week in Geelong.
Right now you look at the following weeks fixture and every game has high anticipation. The only two teams who I would think definitely can't make the eight from here are playing each other next week"

From what I saw of Danger Mouse it wasn't much better.
Avoid, I think.
The recent adaption of the Hilda books also fell off the cliff into the standard, unthinking kids tv tropes of boring, lesson delivering stories with one dimensional characters.
Treat kids with a little respect and give them something meaty and interesting. They deserve it - and it's what made the orginals well loved."
