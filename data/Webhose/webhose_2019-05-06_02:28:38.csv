On
Sat. April 6 White House attorney Rudy Giuliani filed a formal charge
of Treason against Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and called for her
impeachment.
The court papers have not yet been made public, though Pelosi
was suspected to be involved in Child Trafficking at the Arizona Cemex
site; was believed to have received millions in drug money from
convicted Mexican Drug Lord El Chapo (as Chapo confessed and named her
among others, at his sentencing hearing), both of which could have been
her apparent incentive to keep the Mexican Border open for Drugs and
Child Trafficking; she was a suspected conspirator in Russia Gate (a
coup to overturn the 2016 election and start a war with Russia); her
daughters were supposedly caught bringing drugs back from Mexico in her
diplomatic pouch and she has been accused of doing privileged Day
Trading in the basement of Congressional offices before the Markets
opened.
https://beforeitsnews.com/v...
Rudy Giuliani walked into the 1st
Circuit Court of Writs today and filed Articles of Impeachment for Nancy
Pelosi. Giuliani, considered one of the most talented legal minds of
his generation, said the time had come for action:
“The President is tired of the
shenanigans and fake news Congress turning everything he does into
something he shouldn’t have done. We have the best economy of all time
and the country is getting all of its manufacturing and coal jobs back.
Prices on candy bars in New York City are down more than 20 percent this
year. Gas is dropping.
The Democrats are trying everything in
their cheater playbook, including trying to try to convict a sitting
president for his crimes, which can’t be done even if there were crimes.
The 9th Amendment is clear on that.”
Giuliani says the Articles of
Impeachment were filed in Rehnquist Hall “on behalf of the White House
and the Great People of the United States of America.” The articles seek
to have Pelosi impeached, removed, and tried for treason for her role
in the Mueller witch hunts.
In order for an Executive Branch
Impeachment of a sitting Congresswoman to be successful, the Senate has
to approve the measure by a simple majority, which Trump has. Because
she’s the Speaker of the House, under Article 7 Section 15, the House
will get no vote on her impeachment because of the conflict of interest.
It’s always fun to point and laugh when the other side clearly doesn’t understand how things work."
