But things have changed
Tokyo, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - APP - 5th Apr, 2019 ) :"" Money dripping off trees"": that was the sentiment in Tokyo the last time a new emperor took the throne, at the height of Japan 's economic boom. But things have changed.
As Emperor Akihito prepares to step aside and make way for his son Crown Prince Naruhito, the boom time excesses have long gone, replaced by lingering worry about stagnation in the world 's third-largest economy.
From the ashes of World War II, Japan witnessed what was dubbed an economic ""miracle"", fuelled by innovative electronic goods, that reached its pinnacle in the late 1980s.
Flush with cash, Japanese investors snapped up paintings like Van Gogh's ""Sunflowers"" and US landmarks including the Rockefeller Centre in Manhattan .
The Tokyo Stock Exchange 's benchmark Nikkei index rallied to near 39,000 at the end of 1989, the first year of the Heisei era that will end with Akihito's abdication on April 30.
Three decades ago, soaring land prices sparked wild cost comparisons: the Imperial Palace grounds were worth more than all of Canada , and Tokyo and its three surrounding prefectures worth more than the entire United States of America.
""It was an enormous asset bubble. It was a surreal world ,"" said former banker Tag Murphy.
""It felt as if money was dripping off trees,"" he told AFP.
But as Naruhito prepares to ascend the Chrysanthemum Throne on May 1, the Nikkei has lost nearly half its peak value to hover around 21,000 and the central bank is waging a years-long losing battle against deflation. Facebook Twitter Google + Related Topics"

Karachi (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News – 5th April, 2019) Indian Air Force Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman can no more be called a hero as a US publication rejected Indian claim of shooting down Pakistan’s F-16 on February 27.
Wing Commander Abhinandan was arrested by Pakistani forces on February 27 when his aircraft was shot down by Pakistan Air Force after violation of Pakistan air-space.
Pakistan released Indian fighter pilot Wing Commander Abhinandan and handed him over to Indian authorities at Wagah Border on March 1.
His release was announced by Prime Minister Imran Khan as a peace gesture during a speech in Joint Session of the Parliament .
After he returned to India , he was seen as a hero as Indian government claimed to have shot down Pakistan’s F-16 in the February 27 strike by Abhinandan .
However, US publication Foreign Policy has rejected Indian claims of shooting down Pakistan’s F-16 as US officials did not find any Pakistani F-16 missing.
""It is possible that in the heat of combat, Varthaman, flying a vintage MiG-21 Bison, got a lock on the Pakistani F-16, fired, and genuinely believed he scored a hit. But the count, conducted by US authorities on the ground in Pakistan , sheds doubt on New Delhi 's version of events, suggesting that Indian authorities may have misled the international community about what happened that day,"" Foreign Policy noted.
According to the Foreign Policy magazine, Pakistan invited the US to physically count its F-16 planes after the incident as part of an end-user agreement signed when the foreign military sale was finalized.
""Two senior US defense officials with direct knowledge of the situation told Foreign Policy that US. personnel recently counted Islamabad 's F-16s and found none missing,"" the publication says in a report published on Thursday.
""A US count of Pakistan 's F-16 fleet has found that all the jets are present and accounted for, a direct contradiction to India 's claim that it shot down one of the fighter jets during a February clash,"" the report added. Facebook Twitter Google + Related Topics"

Sydney, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 5th Apr, 2019 ) : Facebook will block election advertising from outside Australia ahead of polls next month, in the wake of growing criticism of the social media giant's role in the spread of disinformation.
The restrictions -- already rolled out for polls in other countries such as Thailand and Indonesia -- will come into force when the government announces the election date in the coming days.
""We're temporarily not allowing electoral ads purchased from outside Australia ahead of the election in May ,"" Facebook 's Australia and New Zealand policy director Mia Garlick said in a statement.
""The restriction... will apply to ads we determine to be coming from foreign entities that are of an electoral nature, meaning they contain references to politicians, parties or election suppression.
""We also won't allow foreign ads that include political slogans and party logos. "" Facebook said it has introduced restrictions on foreign electoral ads in countries including Nigeria , Ukraine , Thailand , Indonesia , and Ireland around its May 2018 referendum on abortion.
For the European Parliamentary elections, it requires advertisers to be authorised in their country to run ads related to the vote .
The world 's biggest social network first began looking into its influence on elections after revelations of Russian influence campaigns during the 2016 US election .

WARSAW (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 05th April, 2019) The Polish Orthodox Church has confirmed it does nor recognize the autocephaly of the new Orthodox Church of Ukraine , the Polish Orthodox Church 's Council of Bishops said in a statement.
The council said that it had studied multiple letters on the matter, including from Russia , Ukraine , Serbia , Cyprus , Bulgaria , the Czech Republic , Constantinople, Alexandria and the UN Human Rights Council. Upon studying related correspondence, the council decided to reaffirm its position on autocephaly, stipulated in the resolutions issued in May and November last year and also in messages by Metropolitan Sawa, the primate of the Polish Orthodox Church .
""Apostates, deprived of priesthood, cannot represent a healthy church system. This [granting autocephaly to the new Ukrainian church] is a non-canonical move that breaches eucharistic ... unity ,"" the council said.
The council reaffirmed that the Polish Orthodox Church believed that the Ukrainian church should receive autocephaly, but ""on the basis of dogmatic and canonical regulations of the entire Orthodox Church , not by a group of dissenters. ""
In mid-December 2018 , the unification council was held in Kiev at Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko's initiative, during which the head of the new church � uniting the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Kiev Patriarchate and the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church , two previously non-canonical structures � was elected. Meanwhile, the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate � the only canonical Orthodox jurisdiction in Ukraine back then � has officially refused to take part in the council. It has defrocked its two bishops who attended the council.
On January 6, Constantinople Patriarch Bartholomew handed over the tomos of autocephaly to the head of the new church .
The Russian Orthodox Church has refused to recognize the results of the council and Constantinople's decision to grant autocephaly to the new Ukrainian church institution. Facebook Twitter Google + Related Topics"

""We're making progress on the software update that will prevent future accidents ... As part of this process we have identified an aspect of the software, unrelated to MCAS, that will also be addressed as part of the software update,"" the company said in a statement as quoted by the Financial Times newspaper late on Thursday.
At the same time, the company stressed that it was a ""relatively minor issue"" and Boeing already knew how to fix it, the newspaper reported.
An official close to the matter told the outlet that Boeing had informed the Federal Aviation Administration about the newly emerged issue and decided to postpone the software update � which was initially supposed to have been submitted last week.

Islamabad (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News – 5th April, 2019) US publication Foreign Policy has rejected Indian claims of shooting down Pakistan’s F-16 on February 27.
According to the Foreign Policy magazine, Pakistan invited the US to physically count its F-16 planes after the incident as part of an end-user agreement signed when the foreign military sale was finalized.

""It is possible that in the heat of combat, Varthaman, flying a vintage MiG-21 Bison, got a lock on the Pakistani F-16, fired, and genuinely believed he scored a hit.

Earlier, the Inter Services Public Relations ( ISPR ) on Monday rejected repeated Indian claims about use of F-16 aircraft by the PAF in the air battle on February 27 and shooting down one of them.
The ISPR in a press release said the February 27 event was part of history now.
""No Pakistani F-16 was hit by Indian Air Force,"" the ISPR stated.
As regards the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) action for strikes across the Line of Control (LOC), the ISPR said it was done by JF-17 aircraft from within the Pakistani airspace. Later, when two Indian jets crossed the LOC they were shot down by the PAF.
Whether it was F-16 or JF-17, which shot down two Indian aircraft is immaterial. Even if F-16 have been used as at that point in time complete PAF was airborne, including F-16s, the fact remains that Pakistan Air Force shot down two Indian jets in self-defence. the ISPR said.
"" India can assume any type of their choice even F-16. Pakistan retains the right to use anything and everything in its legitimate self defence,"" it added."

WASHINGTON (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 05th April, 2019) NATO wrapped up its two-day ministerial in Washington where foreign ministers approved new measures to counter Russia in the Black Sea and discussed strategies for boosting collective security.
The ministerial marked the transatlantic treaty organization's 70th anniversary. Originally established by 12 states in 1949, NATO over the past seven decades has expanded into a 29-member alliance .
Moscow has repeatedly condemned NATO 's military buildup near Russia 's borders, warning that the alliance 's aggressive moves could provoke an escalation into a full-fledged confrontation. NATO has several times throughout its history intervened in other countries without the consent of the UN Security Council.
The NATO foreign ministers during two plenary sessions at the State Department on Thursday discussed the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty and new spending on weapons.
Russia and the United States have long accused each other of violating the INF treaty, and both sides have denied the accusations. On February 1, the United States announced it was suspending its obligations under the 1987 INF Treaty and launched the withdrawal process. Washington said the withdrawal process will be completed within six months unless Russia remedies its alleged treaty violations.
The foreign ministers of the NATO member states discussed potential steps they can take against Russia after the treaty's termination, Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said at a press conference on Thursday.
""We all believe that Russia continues to be in violation if the [INF] Treaty,"" Stoltenberg said. ""Today, we discussed the way forward, and what potential measures we can take should Russia not return into compliance.""
However, the NATO chief claimed that the alliance has no plans to deploy ground-based nuclear weapons throughout Europe if the INF Treaty falls apart.
Stoltenberg in an address to Congress on Wednesday said NATO must be prepared for a world without the INF Treaty and all its member states must boost defense spending.
"" NATO allies must spend more on defense,"" Stoltenberg said. ""Those funds will allow us to invest in new capabilities our armed forces need, including advanced fighter aircraft, attack helicopters, missile defense and surveillance drones.""
In the last two years, Stoltenberg observed, European allies and Canada have spent an additional $41 billion on defense and by the end of next year that number will hit $100 billion .
On Wednesday, throughout most of Stoltenberg's speech to Congress , he outlined a series of military measures to counter Russia 's alleged assertiveness, but he also claimed he did not want to isolate Moscow .
Stoltenberg said he underscored it is necessary to have dialogue with Russia regarding arms control issues.
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko said the NATO states increasingly use nuclear components in their military drills in the region.
Ministers of the NATO alliance agreed on Thursday to a package of measures aimed at enhancing their support for Georgia and Ukraine especially in the area of maritime defense, Stoltenberg said.
""We agreed on a package of measures to improve our situation awareness and to step up our support for both Georgia and Ukraine in areas such as training of maritime forces and coast guards, port visits and exercises and sharing information,"" Stoltenberg told reporters.
Polish Foreign Minister Jacek Czaputowicz told Sputnik later in the day that the decision to boost NATO activity in the Black Sea is still at the stage of a political decision and the details have yet to be worked out.
Regarding NATO 's support for Ukraine and Georgia , Stoltenberg said the alliance invitations for both countries to become members should not been see as provocations against Russia .
US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said during remarks on Thursday that NATO must adapt to face new global security threats including Russian aggression and Chinese strategic competition.
However, ministers at the ministerial did not bring up any discussions on the issue of expanding NATO activity in the Baltic region, Pompeo added.
Russia has repeatedly accused the US-led bloc of illegally expanding eastward in Europe in violation of its promises. NATO has been building up its military on Russia 's eastern flank, deploying troops to Estonia , Latvia , Lithuania and Poland while US warships have been routinely calling on Black Sea ports.
One ""sideshow"" issue that seemed to get more attention than other core NATO topics during the two days was the US-Turkish dispute over the Russia S-400 missile defense system.
The Pentagon announced on Monday that the United States halted its deliveries and activities with Turkey on F-35 operational capabilities over Ankara 's decision to buy the S-400s.
The NATO Secretary-General said during a press conference on Thursday that he is hopeful the United States and Turkey will resolve their intensifying dispute over Ankara 's purchase of Russia 's S-400 defense systems.
Other critical security issues the NATO foreign ministers discussed on Thursday included Afghanistan and counterterrorism operations in the middle East.
Stoltenberg also said the ministers in the NATO ministerial discussed the Afghan peace talks, maintaining pressure on the Islamic State terrorist group (banned in Russia ) to ensure its defeat and enhancing training with Iraqi security forces to stabilize the country.
He also noted that NATO is working with Jordan on countering improvised explosive devices.
Pompeo in his remarks on Thursday said NATO ministers addressed concerns over Russia sending military personnel to Venezuela amid its ongoing political crises.
Russian President Vladimir Putin said NATO 's actions near Russia 's borders were aimed at ""undermining a military parity that has formed over decades."" The Russian Foreign Ministry believes that strengthening NATO 's military potential near Russia 's borders threatens stability and security in Europe . Facebook Twitter Google + Related Topics"
World's first 5G phone released in South Korea,www.urdupoint.com,,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.urdupoint.com/en/miscellaneous/worlds-first-5g-phone-released-in-south-kore-586450.html,"World's First 5G Phone Released In South Korea Zeeshan Aziz (@imziishan) 1 day ago Fri 05th April 2019 | 10:05 AM
Seoul, April 5 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 5th Apr, 2019 ) : Samsung Electronics on Friday released the Galaxy S10 5G , the world 's first available smartphone with built-in fifth-generation communications technology , as South Korea seeks to build a lead in the transformative system.
On Wednesday the South became the first country to commercially launch nationwide 5G services, with three superfast networks going live offering data speeds that allow users to download entire movies in less than a second.
Hours later US giant Verizon began commercial services in Chicago and Minneapolis , after rival AT&T made a 5G-based system available to selected users in parts of 12 cities in December .
South Korea's three mobile carriers -- SK Telecom, KT and LG Uplus -- held launch events across Seoul for the Galaxy S10, whose base version costs 1.39 million won ($1,200).
Interactive virtual-reality displays and robot demonstrations were on show to tout the capabilities of the latest iteration of mobile internet speed, and new users were excited about the possibilities, especially live streaming of sports games and university lectures.
""I watch a lot of videos often, movies and lectures,"" said buyer Shim Ji-hye, 38. ""I hope faster speeds will help me manage my time better."" Another user said he was most excited about virtual reality content -- which includes games and even ""celebrity VR dating"" apps according to the country's mobile carriers.
With 5G , said researcher Lee Sang-yoon, VR content ""can be enjoyed in real time with no delay... I'll be able to enjoy it in better resolution and speed"".
Before Friday's roll-out of the samsung phone, the 5G service had been restricted to a handful of specially selected users in South Korea .
Rival manufacturer LG is due to launch its V50 ThinQ, another 5G phone, in the South later this month, while in the US, Verizon's network works with lenovo 's Moto Z3 smartphone fitted with a special accessory.
Commercialising 5G gives South Korea the chance to build around the technology , which is crucial for the future development of devices such as autonomous vehicles and the Internet of Things.
It is expected to bring about $565 billion in global economic benefits by 2034, according to the London-based Global System for Mobile Communications, an industry alliance .
The implications of the new technology have pitted Washington against Beijing -- whose firms dominate 5G technology -- in an increasingly bitter standoff.
The US has pressed its allies and major economies to avoid 5G solutions from Chinese-owned telecom giant Huawei , citing security risks that technological backdoors could give Beijing access to 5G-connected utilities and other components.
Chinese entities own a total of 3,400 5G patents -- more than a third of the total, according to data analysis firm IPlytics -- with 1,529 of those registered by Huawei .
South Korea comes next, with its companies holding 2,051 patents, while US firms have 1,368 together.
Neither KT nor SK Telecom use Huawei technology in their 5G networks, but it is a supplier to LG UPlus, the companies told AFP. Facebook Twitter Google + Related Topics"

London, April 5 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 5th Apr, 2019 ) :The prospect of Britain holding European elections would have been unthinkable just weeks ago but with the Brexit timetable now uncertain, the country is reluctantly planning for a possible campaign.
Village halls and schools across the country are being booked as polling centres, and orders placed with specialist stationers for tens of millions of ballots in case the May 23 vote goes ahead.
The government has yet to give formal notice of the poll, with the deadline next Friday, but this week agreed to pay for initial preparations.
And after Prime Minister Theresa May admitted she would seek to again delay Brexit , amid continuing deadlock over her plan to leave, officials believe such notice is inevitable.
""If we were to still be a member of the EU, which is not our government 's intention, but if we were, we would need to have European Parliament elections,"" Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay told MPs on Thursday.
Yet both the ruling Conservatives and the main opposition Labour Party are keeping quiet about any campaign plans, wary of how voters might respond."

Los Angeles, April 5 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - APP - 5th Apr, 2019 ) :The annual drive down Magnolia Lane to the stately confines of Augusta National Golf Club comes none too soon in what's so far been a contentious, quarrelsome season.
Perhaps among the towering pines and azaleas at Augusta , where the genteel traditions of the game continue to hold sway, controversy surrounding new rules, clashes of personality and mere flashes of pettiness will be put aside in pursuit of the Green Jacket at the first men's major championship of 2019 -- The Masters.
Spain's 2017 Masters champion Sergio Garcia has been front and center as incivility flared this season.
Garcia was disqualified from the inaugural Saudi International in February for taking his frustrations out on two of the greens at Royal Greens Golf Club, damaging the putting surfaces during the tournament.
He became the first player on the European Tour to be disqualified under Rule 1.2a, which deals with conduct expected from players and declares golfer are ""expected to play in the spirit of the game by acting with integrity, showing consideration to others and taking good care of the course. "" A chastened Garcia offered an apology, blaming his tantrum on ""emotional, personal news "" he'd received earlier in the week.
American Matt Kuchar also found himself offering an apology -- albeit a belated one -- after he was excoriated on social media over paying his local caddie just $5,000 for his $1.3 million victory at last year's Mayakoba Golf Classic in Mexico .
Kuchar's insistence that the payment was fair -- calling it a ""good week"" for a caddie who normally makes $100-$200 a day -- only brought more criticism and the US veteran eventually backtracked, agreeing in February to pay caddie David Giral Ortiz the $50,000 he had requested -- still well below the 10 percent bonus from Kuchar's purse that a regular US PGA Tour caddie would have expected.
Testy twosome Garcia and Kuchar were embroiled in drama again at the WGC Match Play -- over Kuchar's failure to concede a tap-in putt to the Spaniard in the quarter-final clash."

Los Angeles, April 5 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 5th Apr, 2019 ) :Giannis Antetokounmpo scored 45 points and had 13 rebounds as the Milwaukee Bucks clinched the best record in the Eastern Conference with a 128-122 victory over the Philadelphia 76ers on Thursday.
It is the first time in franchise history that the Bucks head into the playoffs as the top seed in the East.
""I was just trying to make plays and trying to find the opportunity to attack ,"" Antetokounmpo said.
Khris Middleton finished with 22 points for Milwaukee , who locked up home court advantage in the playoffs and won the season series over the 76ers after the teams split their first two games.
""It's been a really special year,"" Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. ""I'm very proud of the team."" Philadelphia 's Joel Embiid recorded his second career triple-double with 34 points, 13 rebounds and 13 assists in his return from a three-game absence due to a sore left knee.
JJ Reddick added 29 points and Mike Scott scored 22 for Philadelphia , who failed to solidify their hold on the number three seed in the East by losing their third straight game. Philadelphia dropped to 49-30 on the season.
The game got heated in the early stages as less than three minutes in Milwaukee 's Eric Bledsoe was ejected after receiving two technical fouls. Bledsoe got tangled up with Philadelphia 's Embiid and was thrown out by the officials after he fired the ball at Embiid, hitting him in the stomach.
Embiid and Philadelphia 's Mike Scott also received technicals.
Antetokounmpo scored 12 points in the first quarter as the Bucks took a 30-26 lead into the second. Milwaukee looked like they would take the lead into halftime but Philadelphia erased a six-point deficit over the final four minutes of the second quarter to jump ahead 58-56.
In the fourth quarter, Antetokounmpo made a free throw to cap a 6-0 run with 6:27 left to tie it 104-104.
It is the 42nd time this season, Antetokounmpo has scored 25 or more points and 10 or more rebounds in a game.
""He's been doing it all for us this whole season,"" Middleton said.
George Hill finished with 20 points while Sterling Brown scored 12 and D.J. Wilson had 11 for Milwaukee , while Ben Simmons dished out 13 assists for Philadelphia .
""We struggled guarding them,"" 76ers coach Brett Brown said. ""We gotta do better.""Now that they have clinched the top spot, the Bucks will likely rest Antetokounmpo for a game. The league MVP candidate missed Milwaukee 's Sunday game at Atlanta because of a sore right ankle."
Japan court likely to extend Ghosn detention,www.urdupoint.com,,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.urdupoint.com/en/miscellaneous/japan-court-likely-to-extend-ghosn-detention-586444.html,"Japan Court Likely To Extend Ghosn Detention Umer Jamshaid 1 day ago Fri 05th April 2019 | 09:50 AM
Tokyo, April 5 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 5th Apr, 2019 ) :Japanese prosecutors are expected Friday to request a 10-day extension to Carlos Ghosn's detention, as the former Nissan boss questioned whether he would receive a fair trial for alleged financial misconduct.
Courts in Japan very rarely refuse to grant such an extension, meaning the 65-year-old auto tycoon can expect to remain in his Tokyo detention centre under intense questioning until mid-April.
Authorities are looking into new allegations that Ghosn transferred some $15 million in Nissan funds between late 2015 and mid-2018 to a dealership in Oman .
They suspect around $5 million of these funds were siphoned off for Ghosn's use, including for the purchase of a luxury yacht and financing personal investments.
Prosecutors say Ghosn ""betrayed"" his duty not to cause losses to Nissan ""in order to benefit himself."" Ghosn denies the allegations and says he is also innocent of the three formal charges he faces: two charges of deferring his salary and concealing that in official shareholders' document, and a further charge of seeking to shift investment losses to the firm.
Stephen Givens, an American attorney practising law in Japan since 1987, told AFP the latest allegations were the most serious yet.
""If the facts are true... that is stealing from the company , that is embezzlement, that is terrible,"" said Givens, who is not connected with the Ghosn case.
""If that's true, it is a serious charge. It differs very significantly from the previous charges that seem minor and technical. These are hurting Nissan or Nissan shareholders and benefiting Ghosn,"" Givens added.
Justice Minister Takashi Yamashita, a former Tokyo prosecutor himself, hit back at growing criticism of the Japanese system, sometimes described as ""hostage justice"" due to long detention periods for suspects aimed at forcing a confession.
""I understand that it is being handled appropriately in accordance with the stipulation of the code of criminal procedure. So the criticism is not warranted,"" Yamashita told journalists."

But the four-time major winner from Northern Ireland figures to be tested at Augusta National by resurgent Tiger Woods , top-ranked Dustin Johnson and second-ranked Justin Rose among others.
Third-ranked McIlroy, who turns 30 next month, has been a consistent contender all season and finally won at the Players after five top-six showings.
""If I concentrate on me, control what I can do, good golf and good attitude takes care of the rest,"" McIlroy said.
""And if I go to Augusta with a similar golf game and the attitude I've shown over the first few weeks of the year, I think I'll have a great chance. "" Oddsmakers like his chances too. Las Vegas Westgate superbook makes him an 8-1 favorite with Johnson next at 10-1 and Woods and Rose at 12-1.
""I feel like I'm doing the little things right,"" McIlroy said. ""And step by step they will add up to all that stuff that other people find important."" Topping that list would be a Masters Green Jacket to put McIlroy among those who have won all four majors, joining Woods, Jack Nicklaus, Ben Hogan, Gary Player and Gene Sarazen.
""I am motivated to make the most of what I have and to put my name among some of the greats of our game,"" McIlroy said.
McIlroy had an epic Masters near-miss in 2011 when he led by four strokes entering the final round only to fire an 80 and settle for a share of 15th.
Since it became the only major he lacked, McIlroy has had to change his mental Masters approach."

Christchurch, New Zealand, April 5 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 5th Apr, 2019 ) :The man accused of shooting dead 50 Muslim worshippers in a Christchurch mosque sat impassively Friday as a New Zealand judge ordered him to undergo tests to determine if he is mentally fit to stand trial for murder .
Survivors and relatives of those killed in the March 15 attacks packed into a Christchurch courtroom as alleged gunman Brenton Tarrant appeared via audio-visual link from a maximum-security prison in Auckland .
The 28-year-old Australian faces 50 murder and 39 attempted murder charges over the shootings at two mosques, which shocked the world and rattled normally peaceful New Zealand .
High Court judge Cameron Mander ruled during the brief hearing that Tarrant would be examined by two health assessors to determine ""whether he is fit to stand trial or insane"".
He was not required to enter a plea and was remanded in custody until his next court appearance on June 14.
He live-streamed himself as he opened fire in the packed Al Noor mosque during Friday prayers and then travelled across town to continue the carnage in the suburban Linwood mosque .
Tarrant was initially charged with one murder count as a holding measure when he made his first court appearance a day after the killings.
However, the charges were updated Friday to include the Names of all 50 who were killed in the attack and 39 others who were wounded.
Judge Mander barred media from filming or photographing proceedings and reiterated an existing ruling that Tarrant's face must be pixillated in images taken during his previous court appearance.
He also ordered the names of the 39 attempted murder victims to be suppressed, saying identifying them could hinder their recovery, and ruled a summary of the prosecution's allegations would not be made public as it contained sensitive information.
New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has called the mosque killings a well-planned "" terrorist attack "" and taken immediate steps to tighten the country's gun laws.
The government has also said it will review laws dealing with hate speech and called for social media giants to do more to combat online extremism.
The latest update from health authorities earlier this week said 24 people remained in hospital after the attacks, four of them critical, including a four-year-old girl. Facebook Twitter Google + Related Topics"

An internal UN report seen by AFP last week said seven million people about 24 percent of Venezuela 's population are in need of humanitarian aid, lacking access to food and medical care.
President Nicolas Maduro has blamed US sanctions for Venezuela 's economic problems but opposition leader Juan Guaido, who has declared himself interim president, says government corruption and mismanagement are at fault.
Guaido is recognized by the United States and around 50 other governments.
The UN Security Council is expected to meet next week at the request of the United States to discuss Venezuela 's humanitarian crisis."

Kigali, April 5 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 5th Apr, 2019 ) : Rwanda on Sunday commemorates the 25th anniversary of the genocide in which at least 800,000 mainly Tutsi people were beaten, hacked and shot to death in a hundred days of slaughter.
A quarter of a century on, the east African nation has recovered economically but the trauma casts a long and dark shadow over the country.
On Sunday , as has become the tradition every April 7, the day the genocide began, President Paul Kagame will light a remembrance flame in the capital at the Kigali Genocide Memorial, where more than 250,000 victims are reputed to be buried.
It marks the beginning of a week of commemoration activities, and the start of a hundred days of national mourning.
In the afternoon on Sunday , Kagame, who led the rebels that chased the genocidal killers out of Rwanda and has been in power ever since, leads memorial commemorations at a ceremony at Kigali 's main football stadium.
The Amahoro National Stadium -- ""peace"" in Rwanda 's Kinyarwanda language -- was used during the genocide by the UN to protect thousands of Tutsis from the massacres on the streets outside.
The Hutu forces, members of the old army and militia forces called the ""Interahamwe"", had been cheered on by blood-curdling anti-Tutsi propaganda that began on April 7 1994, the day after the assassination of President Juvenal Habyarimana, a Hutu.
Kagame, then 36, was a rebel general when he led the mainly Tutsi Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) into Kigali on July 4, and drove Hutu extremists out of the country."

The man fell on Wednesday at a viewing point on the South Rim in Grand Canyon Village and was apparently by himself, Grand Canyon National Park officials said.
Another visitor sounded the alarm and the man 's body was recovered about 400 feet below the rim by a helicopter and rescue team.
Officials did not release the man 's identity but news reports said he was from California and his death was being ruled as accidental.
He was the third person to die at the Grand Canyon in the past two weeks.
On March 26, a body was discovered in a wooded area away from the rim. The identity of the victim has not been released and the cause of death is being investigated.
Two days later on March 28, a 50-year-old tourist from Hong Kong stumbled and fell to his death while trying to take pictures at an overlook.
Park officials urged visitors on Thursday to stay on designated trails and walkways and to keep a safe distance from the edge of the rim.
The Grand Canyon is one of the top tourist destinations in the United States , attracting more than six million visitors a year."

Rio de Janeiro, April 5 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 5th Apr, 2019 ) :The fire that devastated Brazil 's National Museum in September was caused by the air conditioning system and spread quickly because the building lacked the equipment to contain it, Federal police said Thursday.
Ricardo Saadi, chief of the federal police , made the announcement at a news conference at which he ruled out arson.
""The fire broke out in the auditorium and main cause was the installation of air conditioning,"" he said, explaining the system did not meet the manufacturer's recommendations on the use of individual circuit breakers and grounding devices.
The auditorium, which is located on the ground floor of the four-story former imperial palace, was the first room destroyed by the fire , which took six hours to contain.
With the exception of fire extinguishers, the museum didn't have the equipment to help contain the blaze, including alarms, fire houses or fire doors, according to the investigation.
The National Museum fire on September 2, 2018 wiped out much of the collection, dealing a hard blow to the main showcase of Brazil 's anthropological heritage and history.
Since then, dozens of anthropologists, archeologists and paleontologists have spent nine hours a day, six days a week combing through the ashes and charred structure. The facade still stands, though all that was inside and most of its roof were destroyed.
Among the recovered relics are fragments of ""Luzia"" -- the fossilized, 12,000-year-old remains of a human considered the centerpiece of the museum's collection.
There is also a five-ton meteorite called Bendego that survived the blaze, as well as some fragments of a dinosaur, Maxakalisaurus topai."

Seoul, April 5 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 5th Apr, 2019 ) :The world 's biggest smartphone and memory chip maker samsung Electronics warned of a 60 percent-plus plunge in first-quarter operating profits Friday, in the face of a weakening chip market .
Operating profits for January to March would be ""approximately 6.2 trillion won"", the firm said in a statement, down 60.4 percent on the same period last year.
Sales were about 52 trillion won, it said -- 14 percent lower.
The firm is the flagship subsidiary of the giant Samsung Group, by far the biggest of the family-controlled conglomerates that dominate business in the world 's 11th-largest economy, and it is crucial to South Korea 's economic health.
It has enjoyed record profits in recent years despite a series of setbacks, including a humiliating recall and the jailing of its de facto chief.
But now the picture has changed, with chip prices falling as global supply increases and demand weakens.
Samsung Electronics warned investors last week to expect weak operating profits, citing ""unfavourable market conditions"" for displays and memory chips.
""Amid weak demand for memory business , a drop in price for signature products is expected,"" it said then.
""The company will seek to improve cost competitiveness through effective resource management,"" it added, ""while enhancing product quality in the short term"".
Samsung was also launching its top-end S10 5G smartphone Friday, after South Korea this week won the global race to commercially launch the world 's first nationwide 5G networks.
But the company has to contend with increasingly tough competition in the smartphone market from Chinese rivals like Huawei -- which in 2017 surpassed Apple to take second place -- offering quality devices at lower prices."

Hong Kong, April 5 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 5th Apr, 2019 ) :Across much of Britain's former Asian colonies, many are greeting the UK 's impending departure from the European Union with a mixture of bafflement, apathy, amusement and a touch of schadenfreude.
Britain long justified imperial subjugation by arguing Rule Britannia brought order, stability and shared prosperity even after its retreat from colonialism birthed a host of troubled new nations still saddled with historical grievances and legacies to this day.
Now Brits face a chaos and internal division of their own making, alongside potential isolation and years of economic hardship particularly if the UK crashes out with no deal on April 12.
""I was born and brought up in this British colony called Hong Kong and used to think that the Brits were a very sensible people,"" remarked Claudia Mo, a pro-democracy lawmaker in the financial hub .
""I've been watching Brexit process as a former colonial person and it's almost like a farce, it's sadly funny, sadly amusing. I'm baffled as to why and how things got to where they are now. To outsiders it's almost unthinkable,"" she told AFP.
Mo, 62, came of age politically during a turbulent period for her birthplace sparked by Britain's colonial legacy -- the 1997 handover of Hong Kong to China .
Unlike Brexit , Hong Kongers had no say in their future and many were desperate to obtain British passports in case the handover unleashed chaos.
Many youngsters, Mo said, are still looking for opportunities overseas given Beijing 's increasingly authoritarian grip, but they may be less inclined to opt for Britain.
""I think their first choices here are more likely Australia and Canada ,"" she remarked. Facebook Twitter Google + Related Topics"

Washington, April 5 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 5th Apr, 2019 ) :Embattled US aviation giant Boeing on Thursday insisted on the ""fundamental safety"" of its 737 MAX aircraft but pledged to take all necessary steps to ensure the jets' airworthiness.
The statements came hours after Ethiopian officials said pilots of a doomed plane had crashed last month after following the company 's recommendations, leaving 157 people dead .
The preliminary findings released Thursday by transportation authorities in Addis Ababa put the American aircraft giant under even greater pressure to restore public trust, with nearly 350 people dead in crashes involving its formerly top-selling 737 MAX aircraft in less than five months amid mounting signs the company 's onboard anti-stall systems were fault.
""We remain confident in the fundamental safety of the 737 MAX,"" CEO Dennis Muilenburg said in a statement, adding that impending software fixes would make the aircraft ""among the safest airplanes ever to fly."" Muilenburg also acknowledged, however, that an ""erroneous activation"" of Boeing's so-called Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System had occurred. The system is designed to prevent stalls but may have forced the Ethiopian and Indonesian jets into the ground.
In an earlier statement, the head of the company 's commercial aircraft division had said Boeing was ready to perform ""any and all additional steps"" to enhance the safety of the 737 MAX.
A report by Ethiopian investigators on Thursday said the crew of the Ethiopian Airlines plane that crashed last month, killing 157 people, repeatedly followed procedures recommended by Boeing, but were unable to regain control of the jet.
The initial probe appears to confirm concerns about MCAS, with data echoing that from the crash of the Indonesian Lion Air 737 MAX 8 flight in October last year which killed 189 people.
Ethiopian authorities' full report has not been publicly released, but according to a draft copy seen by AFP, shortly after take-off a sensor recording the level of the plane began transmitting faulty data, prompting the autopilot system to point the nose downwards.
""The crew performed all the procedures repeatedly provided by the manufacturer, but was not able to control the aircraft,"" said Ethiopian Transport Minister Dagmawit Moges, unveiling results of the preliminary probe into the crash."

MEXICO CITY/CARACAS (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 05th April, 2019) Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro said a ""nontraditional war"" without weapons was being waged against the South American country, which had faced a number of large power outages over the recent weeks.
""It is a nontraditional war against public services in order to make the country uncontrollable and come to power through chaos and violence,"" Maduro said in an address broadcast by his Periscope channel on Thursday.
Maduro suggested that Venezuela was facing an attempted "" electricity coup and a nontraditional war"" conducted by the United States and the Venezuelan opposition .
The president added that the authorities have been resisting these overthrow attempts and were moving the country toward peace, stability and national unity .
Speaking live on national television on Thursday, Maduro called on Venezuelans to set up water storage hubs across the country to ensure there is enough water in case of new electricity outages.
""I am insisting that at this stage of fighting against imperialistic attacks on critical systems, all Venezuelans should save water and organize reserves on the level of communes,"" Maduro claimed.
The president also instructed a water tank factory to increase its output.
Moreover, Maduro suggested that Venezuela 's ministries should create special groups in WhatsApp messaging platform to communicate information to the public amid the attacks on the Venezuelan infrastructure.
Meanwhile, Venezuelan Minister of Water Administration Evelyn Vasquez said the operation of water pumping stations had been restored in the majority of Venezuela 's regions, adding that some of the areas still lacked water supply.
In March , Venezuela suffered from several large blackouts caused by what the authorities called US attacks on the Venezuelan power grid. Washington has denied any involvement in the power failures.
The crisis in the energy industry erupted amid a political crisis in Venezuela .

UNITED NATIONS, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 5th Apr, 2019 ) :Average life-expectancy globally has increased by five-and-a-half years since the turn of the century , and women outlive men ""everywhere"", according to the World Health Organization (WHO).
""Whether it's homicide, road accidents, suicide , cardiovascular disease - time and time again, men are doing worse than women "", Dr. Richard Cibulskis, main author of WHO's World Health Statistics Overview 2019 , said.
Apart from the average increase from 66.5 years, to 72 years overall, its findings also show that ""healthy"" life expectancy - the number of years individuals live in full health - increased from 58.5 years in 2000, to 63.3 years in 2016 .
Differing attitudes to healthcare between men and women , help to account for the discrepancy in life expectancy between the sexes, the report suggests.
In countries with generalized HIV epidemics, for example, men ""are less likely than women to take an HIV test, less likely to access antiretroviral therapy and more likely to die of AIDS-related illnesses than women "", the study finds.
The same principle applies for tuberculosis sufferers, with male patients less likely to seek care than women . The report also finds that of the 40 leading causes of death, 33 of them contribute more significantly to reduced life expectancy in men than in women .
In 2016 , this corresponded with data indicating that the probability of a 30-year-old man dying from a non-communicable disease - such as heart conditions - before the age of 70, is 44 per cent higher, than for a woman of the same age.
Other findings demonstrated that global suicide rates were 75 per cent higher in men than in women , deaths from road injuries were more than twice as high in men than in women over the age of 15, and male mortality rates linked to homicide were four times higher.
The study also indicates that the life expectancy gap is narrowest where women lack access to health services, with maternal deaths contributing ""more than any other cause"" to reducing female life expectancy, according to Dr. Samira Asma, WHO Assistant Director General for Data, Analytics and Delivery.
""There are shocking differences in the risk of maternal death between high-income and low-income countries,"" she told journalists in Geneva , based on data indicating that one in 41 women dies from a maternal cause in a low-income country, compared with one in 3,300 in a high-income setting.
This finding also tallies with the report's insistence that in almost all developing countries, there are fewer than four nurses and midwives per 1,000 people, and that life expectancy is strongly affected by income.
This is clearest in low-income countries, where people live on average 18.1 years less than in high-income countries, and where one child in every 14 will die before their fifth birthday.
""These statistics underscore the need to prioritize Primary health care urgently to effectively manage noncommunicable diseases, and to curb risk factors."" Dr Asma insisted. ""For example, something as simple as controlling blood pressure is just not happening on the scale needed and tobacco use remains a leading cause of premature death."" While WHO's Global Health Statistics have been disaggregated by sex for the first time, the UN agency cautions that many countries are still struggling to provide gender disaggregated information which could help to better assess individual needs.
One of the trends confirmed in the report is an increase in non-communicable diseases in low and middle- income countries, linked to a rise in risk factors such as smoking, alcohol consumption and unhealthy diets.
The trend is particularly marked on the African continent where it is exacerbated by a lack of access to primary health care and medicine, WHO says."

With top negotiators from the world 's top two economies huddled down in Washington for three days of talks, there has been a growing sense they are close to an agreement to end a stand-off that battered global equities last year.

"" Ecuador does not respond to rumors, speculations and assumptions which are not supported by any documents,"" the ministry said, as quoted by the Comercio news outlet.
Earlier in the day, WikiLeaks said, citing a high-ranked Ecuadorian source that Assange might be ousted from the embassy within ""hours to days,"" adding that the authorities of the Latin American country had already reached an agreement with the United Kingdom on his arrest.
The whistleblowing platform suggested that the Ecuadorian authorities might use a leak in the so-called INA Paper offshore scandal , involving President Lenin Moreno, as a pretext to expel Assange from the embassy.
WikiLeaks' statement followed the claims by Moreno that Assange has been violating the conditions of his asylum in the embassy, explaining that the activist was prohibited from meddling with other states' politics . Moreover, the president said the activist's fate would be soon decided.
The INA papers scandal erupted in February as the documents have been published revealing the alleged links between Moreno and his family and a Panamanian tax haven allegedly used by them for money laundering, something Moreno has denied.
Earlier in April , the government of Ecuador requested the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the right to privacy to take action in relation to the publication of the INA Papers materials, implicating WikiLeaks in the release of the documents. The platform, however, denied claims it was behind the leak."

An overwhelming majority of parents in Oregon who secure vaccine exemptions for their children do so using the state's do-it-yourself option, according to state data.
Data from the Oregon Health Authority shows that of the 31,500 non-medical vaccine exemptions sent in last year, 30,000 were from parents who watched an online education video and printed a do-it-yourself form, according to The Oregonian .
The state has the highest rate of kindergarten vaccine exemptions, with 7.6 percent of students having at least one exemption in the 2017-18 school year. ADVERTISEMENT
Fewer than 2,000 parents chose to talk to a health care provider and acquire a signature for their children's vaccine exemptions, the paper reported.
State Rep. Mitch Greenlick (D) who proposed a bill to eliminate non-medical vaccine exemptions , told the paper he disapproved of the do-it-yourself option.
“It’s obviously letting too many people off the hook,” he said.
The data comes amid a series of measles outbreaks across the country.
The Center for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed 387 measles cases from Jan. 1 to March 28 , more than were reported for the entire year of 2018. Such cases have been confirmed in 15 states.
Some lawmakers across the U.S. have proposed bans on non-medical vaccine exemptions.
New York lawmakers on Thursday called to end non-medical exemptions vaccinations for school-aged children amid an ongoing measles outbreak in multiple parts of the state."

WASHINGTON (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 05th April, 2019) More than 1 million children will require access to basic services this year because of the ongoing crisis in Venezuela , the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF) said in a press release on Friday.
""As a result of the Venezuela migrant crisis, an estimated 1.1 million children -� including children uprooted from Venezuela , as well as returnees and those living in host and transit communities - will need protection and access to basic services across Latin America and the Caribbean in 2019 ,"" the release said.
UNICEF noted that the projection marks an increase from some 500,000 children in need today.
It added that its humanitarian partners predict that some 4.9 million people in the region - including Brazil , Colombia , Ecuador , Guyana , Panama , Peru and Trinidad and Tobago - will need assistance in 2019 because of the crisis in the Latin American country.
""The UN children's agency also called on Governments in the region to uphold the rights of all children, including migrants and refugees , and to ensure their access to essential services,"" UNICEF said, stressing that as the Venezuelan crisis continues, the number of migrants is increasing and vital services in host and transit countries ""are coming under additional strain.""
Uprooted children and their families face difficulties regularizing their immigration status, a factor that can limit their access to social protection, health care and education , UNICEF said.
""Meanwhile, the lack of comprehensive public policies on migratory issues in host countries is putting children at higher risk of discrimination, violence, family separation, xenophobia, exploitation and abuse,"" it added.
UNICEF is also worried about reports of xenophobia, discrimination and violence against Venezuelan children and families in host communities, the release continued.
""Some migrants - including unaccompanied and separated children, pregnant women , nursing mothers as well as indigenous people - are at increased risk,"" it said. ""Registering children on the move is the first step in guaranteeing their rights. Information resulting from the registration process also provides States with valuable information to better plan and budget their response.""
Venezuela has been suffering from a severe political crisis for around two months, after Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido illegally proclaimed himself interim president, contesting the re-election of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro last year.
Guaido immediately received support from the United States , which has also denounced Maduro's re-election, along with a number of other countries. China , Cuba , Russia and a number of other countries have endorsed Maduro as Venezuela 's only legitimate president. Facebook Twitter Google + Related Topics"

WASHINGTON (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 05th April, 2019) Boeing is close to completing its software update for the 737 Max series aircraft and expects the fix to be certified and implemented in the weeks ahead, CEO Dennis Muilenburg said in a press release.
Two Boeing 737 MAX aircraft have crashed over the past six months, one in Ethiopia and the other in Indonesia , killing a combined 346 people on board both airplanes.
""We're taking a comprehensive, disciplined approach, and taking the time, to get the software update right,"" Muilenburg said on Thursday. ""We're nearing completion and anticipate its certification and implementation on the 737 MAX fleet worldwide in the weeks ahead. We regret the impact the grounding has had on our airline customers and their passengers.""
Muilenburg said the software update will eliminate the possibility of the unintended Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) action and prevent an MCAS-related accident from happening again by allowing flight crews to have the ability to override MCAS and manually control the airplane.
Once the software changes are made to the MCAS function, the 737 Max series ""will be among the safest airplanes ever to fly,"" Muilenburg said.
The Ethiopian Airlines-operated crash happened in March and the Lion Air Boeing 737 MAX 8 crash in Indonesia took place in late October . Both crashes occurred within minutes of takeoff and data recovered by investigators indicates that pilots wrestled with the flight control system. The 737 MAX model, Boeing's newest, was grounded in March by US regulators and aviation authorities across the world ."

MOSCOW (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 05th April, 2019) The WikiLeaks whistleblowing platform suggested, citing a source in the Ecuadorian state, that its founder Julian Assange, who is currently residing in the Ecuadorian embassy in London , might be expelled from the facility in a matter of ""hours to days,"" adding the authorities might use a leak about the INAPapers corruption scandal , involving Ecuadorian President Lenin Moreno, as a pretext for the move.
""A high level source within the Ecuadorian state has told @WikiLeaks that Julian Assange will be expelled within ""hours to days"" using the #INAPapers offshore scandal as a pretext--and that it already has an agreement with the UK for his arrest,"" WikiLeaks wrote on Twitter .
Earlier this week, in an interview with a local broadcaster, Moreno accused Assange of violating the conditions of his stay in the embassy. Specifically, the president argued that Assange could not meddle in politics of other states, particularly, Ecuador 's partners.
Moreover, Moreno said he would take action on Assange's stay in the embassy in the near future.
The corruption scandal erupted in February , when Ecuadorian lawmaker Ronny Aleaga said he had received an anonymous dossier including accusations of corruption and money laundering against Moreno and his family over their alleged ties with a Panamanian offshore company INA Investments Corp.
The leak triggered various media publications on the issue and an inquiry by the National Assembly into the steps allegedly taken by its president Elizabeth Cabezas and Interior Minister Maria Paula Romo in order to avoid a probe into Moreno over the scandal .
Despite the fact that WikiLeaks has never published the leaked documents, Moreno has accused the platform of waging a smear campaign against him.
Assange's defense, in its turn, said that the row was used as an excuse to hand Assange over to the United States , adding that the activist had not been involved with WikiLeaks because he quit as an editor last September .
Assange has been living in the Ecuadorian embassy in the United Kingdom , since 2012. The activist has repeatedly said he feared extradition to the United States due to the fact that he had published thousands of leaked classified US authorities' documents. His defense team has cited media reports suggesting that Moreno had sought to reach an agreement with the United States on handing Assange over to Washington in exchange for ""debt relief.""

Trump Admin Says It Wants Two Years To Find Immigrant Kids Separated From Parents – Talking Points Memo,talkingpointsmemo.com,,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/trump-admin-wants-two-years-find-immigrant-kids-separated-parents,"Trump Admin Says It Wants Two Years To Find Immigrant Kids Separated From Parents Mario Tama/Getty Images South America By Associated Press; ELLIOT SPAGAT April 6, 2019 2:09 pm
SAN DIEGO (AP) — The Trump administration wants up to two years to find potentially thousands of children who were separated from their families at the border before a judge halted the practice last year, a task that it says is more laborious than previous efforts because the children are no longer in government custody.
The Justice Department said in a court filing late Friday that it will take at least a year to review about 47,000 cases of unaccompanied children taken into government custody between July 1, 2017 and June 25, 2018 — the day before U.S. District Judge Dana Sabraw halted the general practice of splitting families. The administration would begin by sifting through names for traits most likely to signal separation — for example, children under 5.
The administration would provide information on separated families on a rolling basis to the American Civil Liberties Union, which sued to reunite families and criticized the proposed timeline on Saturday.
“We strongly oppose a plan that could take up to two years to locate these families,” said Lee Gelernt, the ACLU’s lead attorney. “The government needs to make this a priority.”
Sabraw ordered last year that more than 2,700 children in government care on June 26, 2018 be reunited with their families, which has largely been accomplished. Then, in January, the U.S. Health and Human Services Department’s internal watchdog reported that thousands more children may have been separated since the summer of 2017. The department’s inspector general said the precise number was unknown.
The judge ruled last month that he could hold the government accountable for families that were separated before his June order and asked the government submit a proposal for the next steps. A hearing is scheduled April 16.
Sheer volume makes the job different than identifying children who were in custody at the time of the judge’s June order, Jonathan White, a commander of the U.S. Public Health Service and Health and Human Services’ point person on family reunification, said in an affidavit.
White, whose work has drawn strong praise from the judge, would lead the effort to identify additional families on behalf of Health and Health and Human Services with counterparts at Customs and Border Protection and U.S. Immigration and Customs and Enforcement. Dr. Barry Graubard, a statistics expert at the National Cancer Institute, developed a system to flag for early attention those most likely to have been separated.
The vast majority of separated children are released to relatives, but many are not parents. Of children released in the 2017 fiscal year, 49 percent went to parents, 41 percent to close relatives such as an aunt, uncle, grandparent or adult sibling and 10 percent to distant relatives, family friends and others.
The government’s proposed model to flag still-separated children puts a higher priority on the roughly half who were not released to a parent. Other signs of likely separation include children under 5, younger children traveling without a sibling and those who were detained in the Border Patrol’s El Paso, Texas, sector, where the administration ran a trial program that involved separating nearly 300 family members from July to November 2017.
Saturday marks the anniversary of the administration’s “zero tolerance” policy to criminally prosecute every adult who enters the country illegally from Mexico. The administration retreated in June amid an international uproar by generally exempting adults who come with their children. The policy now applies only to single adults. More News"

WASHINGTON (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 05th April, 2019) NATO wrapped up its two-day ministerial in Washington where foreign ministers approved new measures to counter Russia in the Black Sea and discussed strategies for boosting collective security.
The ministerial marked the transatlantic treaty organization's 70th anniversary. Originally established by 12 states in 1949, NATO over the past seven decades has expanded into a 29-member alliance .
Moscow has repeatedly condemned NATO 's military buildup near Russia 's borders, warning that the alliance 's aggressive moves could provoke an escalation into a full-fledged confrontation. NATO has several times throughout its history intervened in other countries without the consent of the UN Security Council.
The NATO foreign ministers during two plenary sessions at the State Department on Thursday discussed the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty and new spending on weapons.
Russia and the United States have long accused each other of violating the INF treaty, and both sides have denied the accusations. On February 1, the United States announced it was suspending its obligations under the 1987 INF Treaty and launched the withdrawal process. Washington said the withdrawal process will be completed within six months unless Russia remedies its alleged treaty violations.
The foreign ministers of the NATO member states discussed potential steps they can take against Russia after the treaty's termination, Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said at a press conference on Thursday.
""We all believe that Russia continues to be in violation if the [INF] Treaty,"" Stoltenberg said. ""Today, we discussed the way forward, and what potential measures we can take should Russia not return into compliance.""
However, the NATO chief claimed that the alliance has no plans to deploy ground-based nuclear weapons throughout Europe if the INF Treaty falls apart.
Stoltenberg in an address to Congress on Wednesday said NATO must be prepared for a world without the INF Treaty and all its member states must boost defense spending.
"" NATO allies must spend more on defense,"" Stoltenberg said. ""Those funds will allow us to invest in new capabilities our armed forces need, including advanced fighter aircraft, attack helicopters, missile defense and surveillance drones.""
In the last two years, Stoltenberg observed, European allies and Canada have spent an additional $41 billion on defense and by the end of next year that number will hit $100 billion .
On Wednesday, throughout most of Stoltenberg's speech to Congress , he outlined a series of military measures to counter Russia 's alleged assertiveness, but he also claimed he did not want to isolate Moscow .
Stoltenberg said he underscored it is necessary to have dialogue with Russia regarding arms control issues.
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko said the NATO states increasingly use nuclear components in their military drills in the region.
Ministers of the NATO alliance agreed on Thursday to a package of measures aimed at enhancing their support for Georgia and Ukraine especially in the area of maritime defense, Stoltenberg said.
""We agreed on a package of measures to improve our situation awareness and to step up our support for both Georgia and Ukraine in areas such as training of maritime forces and coast guards, port visits and exercises and sharing information,"" Stoltenberg told reporters.
Polish Foreign Minister Jacek Czaputowicz told Sputnik later in the day that the decision to boost NATO activity in the Black Sea is still at the stage of a political decision and the details have yet to be worked out.
Regarding NATO 's support for Ukraine and Georgia , Stoltenberg said the alliance invitations for both countries to become members should not been see as provocations against Russia .
US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said during remarks on Thursday that NATO must adapt to face new global security threats including Russian aggression and Chinese strategic competition.
However, ministers at the ministerial did not bring up any discussions on the issue of expanding NATO activity in the Baltic region, Pompeo added.
Russia has repeatedly accused the US-led bloc of illegally expanding eastward in Europe in violation of its promises. NATO has been building up its military on Russia 's eastern flank, deploying troops to Estonia , Latvia , Lithuania and Poland while US warships have been routinely calling on Black Sea ports.
One ""sideshow"" issue that seemed to get more attention than other core NATO topics during the two days was the US-Turkish dispute over the Russia S-400 missile defense system.
The Pentagon announced on Monday that the United States halted its deliveries and activities with Turkey on F-35 operational capabilities over Ankara 's decision to buy the S-400s.
The NATO Secretary-General said during a press conference on Thursday that he is hopeful the United States and Turkey will resolve their intensifying dispute over Ankara 's purchase of Russia 's S-400 defense systems.
Other critical security issues the NATO foreign ministers discussed on Thursday included Afghanistan and counterterrorism operations in the middle East.
Stoltenberg also said the ministers in the NATO ministerial discussed the Afghan peace talks, maintaining pressure on the Islamic State terrorist group (banned in Russia ) to ensure its defeat and enhancing training with Iraqi security forces to stabilize the country.
He also noted that NATO is working with Jordan on countering improvised explosive devices.
Pompeo in his remarks on Thursday said NATO ministers addressed concerns over Russia sending military personnel to Venezuela amid its ongoing political crises.
Russian President Vladimir Putin said NATO 's actions near Russia 's borders were aimed at ""undermining a military parity that has formed over decades."" The Russian Foreign Ministry believes that strengthening NATO 's military potential near Russia 's borders threatens stability and security in Europe . Facebook Twitter Google + Related Topics"

WASHINGTON (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 05th April, 2019) Mexico is facing a potential 25 percent tariff on its car imports to the United States if it does not do enough to stop illegal migration and drug trafficking, US President Donald Trump told reporters at the White House .
""Before we close the border we'll put the tariffs on the cars,"" Trump said on Thursday. ""I don't think we'll ever have to close the border because the penalty of tariffs on cars coming into the United States from Mexico at 25 percent will be massive.""
Earlier on Thursday, Trump said he would give Mexico a one year warning to stop drug trafficking and illegal migration before the United States imposes tariffs.
Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard said on Wednesday that Mexico had chosen to follow the strategy of not responding to US statements related to the influx of migrants passing through Mexican territory. Ebrard suggested that Trump 's recent statements were related to the US 2020 presidential election .
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has said that neither Washington nor Mexico City would benefit from a closure of the border .
According to Mexico 's Ministry of Internal Affairs, more than 76,000 migrants were detained after trying to get into the United States in February , while in March the figure was expected to increase to 100,000 people."

Earlier this week, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro announced the creation of a headquarters on electrical power supplies to be headed by Vice President Delcy Rodriguez.
In early March , Venezuela suffered its worst power outage in its history with the electricity failure happening in 21 out of 23 states. The authorities said the incident had been caused by ""sabotage"" at the country's largest Guri hydroelectric power plant, which generates electricity for nearly the whole country.
Major power outages continued across Venezuela later in March . Caracas has said that the country's power system had suffered several attacks and blamed them on Washington which denied the claims."

UNITED NATIONS (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 05th April, 2019) The United Kingdom 's mission to the United Nations has requested holding an urgent UN Security Council meeting on Friday regarding the escalation of tensions in Libya , a diplomatic source told Sputnik.
Earlier on Thursday, the Al-Arabiya broadcaster reported that the Libyan National Army (LNA) Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar ordered his troops to launch an offensive on Tripoli to liberate the city from terrorists.
Haftar issued the order after the LNA took control over cities of Surman and Garyan, which previously were under the authority the UN-supported interim Government of National Accord. Haftar reportedly called on the LNA forces to ensure the safety of foreigners in Tripoli and not to shoot at civilians.
The UN Security Council is expected to convene for closed session consultations on Friday, the diplomatic source said.
On Wednesday, the Government of National Accord declared a general military alert after Haftar-led eastern forces announced they were moving to western parts of the country.
Libya has been embroiled in political crisis since National Transitional Council forces, supported by NATO , murdered the country's former head, Muammar Gaddafi.
The country has been divided between the LNA-backed parliament , elected in 2014 and based in Tobruk in the east and the Government of National Accord, established on an initiative of the United Nations , that previously controlled Tripoli ."

Emissions up as car buyers switch from diesel to gasoline – POLITICO,www.politico.eu,msn.com,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.eu/article/co2-emissions-up-as-car-buyers-switch-from-diesel-to-gasoline-air-pollution-emissions-diesel-transport-fossil-fuels/,"Joshua Posaner and Charlie Cooper
However, that strategy has collapsed in the wake of Volkswagen's 2015 admission that it cheated on emissions tests. There is also growing concern about urban pollution — diesel emissions are a key driver of smog — and cities across the Continent are moving to ban older and more polluting diesel cars from their streets.
Diesel’s sudden unpopularity has sent buyers back to gasoline, as carmakers still aren't producing enough attractive (and affordable) no- and low-emission vehicles to make up the slack.
The data tells the story.
Some carmakers are already failing to meet their annual targets.
For the first time since 2009, gasoline overtook diesel — accounting for 53 percent of registrations. The two conventional technologies together accounted for 97.1 percent of new registrations.
The share of plug-in hybrid and battery-powered electric cars rose from 1 percent to 1.5 percent in 2017. Hydrogen cars made an appearance for the first time with fewer than 200 units, with other alternatives such as liquefied petroleum gas and compressed natural gas cars accounting for the remaining registrations.
The trend is continuing, according to the European Automotive Manufacturers' Association.
The lobby group said only 2 percent of all new cars registered last year were electrically chargeable. At the same time, petrol further expanded its market share by almost 6.5 percentage points in 2018, accounting for 56.7 percent of all cars sold in the EU.
Some carmakers are already failing to meet their annual targets.
In 2017, Lamborghini, Mazda and Alpine missed their goals; the three carmakers represented 1.4 percent of all new car sales. But there’s trouble ahead for other manufacturers. The EEA said that “certain other manufacturers, if considered individually, would have exceeded their specific emission target,” only meeting their obligations as members of pools or thanks to derogations. In contrast, all van manufacturers met their 2017 targets.
Analysts are closely watching the emissions data.
Moody’s, the credit rating agency, said in an emailed comment Thursday that with the 2021 deadline fast approaching, half of large manufacturers need “to take drastic action over the next two years of production.”
Carmakers missing their targets face hefty fines. Moody's estimates that “half the manufacturers could share €2.4 billion of potential penalties for failing to comply,” pointing to Volkswagen, Fiat Chrysler, Ford and Hyundai-Kia as “most exposed.” Authors:"

Share on Facebook Share on Twitter
As we told you earlier today, a video of President Trump from last May is circulating under the guise that he referred to all asylum seekers as “animals” and has been fact-checked as false (Trump was referring to MS-13 gang members), but Dan Rather isn’t about to let that deter him from spreading the fake news: The President likening human beings to animals is despicable. I've seen this playbook before, words weaponized into bloodshed. His sneering rhetoric must be denounced. All who remain silent stand on the side of an insidious and dangerous scapegoating of our fellow human beings.
