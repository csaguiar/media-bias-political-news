Phil Mickelson Threw $100 Bill at Country Music Star Jake Owen After Being Confronted Over Tiger Woods Match: 'Go F*** Yourself',www.newsweek.com,,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsweek.com/jake-owen-phil-mickelson-interview-match-jordan-spieth-wedding-1384509,"Phil Mickelson has never been shy about expressing his opinions, and he lived up to his reputation when he was confronted by country music star Jake Owen. The latter was incensed at the lack of quality on display at a showdown between Mickelson and Tiger Woods last November.
The former won $9 million after claiming the winner-takes-all “The Match” at Shadow Creek Golf Course in Las Vegas, but fans felt the unusual head-to-head between the two golfing heavyweights didn’t live up to the months-long hype.
Owen told Barstool Sports' Fore Play podcast he was among the disgruntled viewers who paid $29.99 to watch the pay-per-view event.
Luckily for him, he had the chance to demand a refund almost immediately, as he and Mickelson both attended Jordan Spieth’s wedding the day after the event.
""I'd had a few cocktails, and I saw him across the room, and I was like, 'I gotta go and tell this guy what I think,'"" said Owen, who is an amateur golfer and has partnered with Spieth in past editions of the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am.
“So I walked over to him, and I was like, ‘Hey Phil, you owe me f***ing $29.99 for wasting four hours of my life with the s est golf I’ve ever seen.'""
The 37-year-old singer, who was named breakthrough artist of the year at the 2012 American Country Awards, then told Mickelson he felt the hype surrounding the match had turned out to be completely unjustified.
“You guys couldn’t even make three birdies between the two of you,” he told the five-time major championship winner. “I want my $29.99 back and apologize to me for some s***ty golf.”
Clearly unimpressed by Owen’s tirade, Mickelson then pulled out a stack of $100 bills, before flicking one toward the singer and telling him, “I won 90,000 of these yesterday. Take a $100 and go f**k yourself.”
Anyone who thought Mickelson might attempt to contest Owen’s version of events, or at least dial down his response, was left disappointed.
""True story"" was Mickelson's reply to the tweet promoting Owen's interview with Fore Play .
After bringing a five-year winless streak to an end in March 2018, Mickelson has started the year on the front foot, winning the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am in February.
The American finished 19 under par after carding a bogey-free 65 in his final round, beating England’s Paul Casey by three strokes.

"Donald Trump's 'Cruelty Has Failed,' Julian Castro Says: More Families Are Coming Now After Child Separation Policy",www.newsweek.com,,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trumps-cruelty-has-failed-julian-castro-says-more-families-are-coming-1384462,"As presidential candidate Julian Castro unveiled a sweeping immigration plan that would unravel a number of measures instituted under Presidents Donald Trump and George W. Bush on Tuesday, the Democrat took aim at Trump, saying the U.S. leader's immigration ""cruelty has failed"" in its goal to curb illegal immigration.
Castro, who previously served as mayor of San Antonio and as secretary of Housing and Urban Development under President Barack Obama, made the comments in an interview with NPR, lashing out at Trump over his administration's widely condemned ""zero tolerance"" policy that resulted in family separations.
""This president's cruelty has failed,"" Castro said of the zero tolerance policy, which saw 2,500 children separated from their parents at the U.S.-Mexico border. Trump rescinded the rule on June 20 in response to widespread backlash.
""A year ago this administration asked us to believe that if we could be cruel enough to separate little children from their mothers that would deter more families from coming,"" Castro said.
But, he said, ""actually the opposite is true. More families are coming now.""
Last week, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) sounded the alarm that it had reached its ""breaking point"" in managing a surge in arrivals at the U.S.-Mexico border, including many families from across Central America with young children.
As CBP Commissioner Kevin McAleenan warned that the agency could not keep up with the situation at the southern border, Trump threatened to shut down U.S. ports of entry entirely.
The U.S. leader also set in motion plans to cut aid to Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador, where the majority of asylum seekers come from. He accused the three countries, collectively known as the Northern Triangle, of not doing enough to deter irregular migration to the U.S.
While Trump has overseen a hardline campaign to crack down on immigration to the U.S., Castro's immigration plan seeks to undo the U.S. leader's efforts. The centerpiece of Castro's plan is to provide a pathway to citizenship for undocumented residents of the U.S. who do not currently have a pathway to legal status but live work and have families across the country.
In a Medium post on his plan, Castro said that the next U.S. president ""must start by reversing the cruel policies of the Trump administration—including the Muslim ban, wasteful spending on a pointless wall, and cuts to the refugee program—and ending the vile rhetoric that has scapegoated and vilified immigrants.
""I'm proud to unveil an immigration policy that reintegrates those collective values in our immigration system,"" Castro said. ""A policy that is sensible and fair and treats those who cross our borders in search of refuge with empathy and understanding.
""It's time our nation's immigration system reflect the collective values that we all share—equality, fairness, justice and compassion,"" Castro said. ""It's time that we recognize that protecting our borders and treating immigrants with compassion are not mutually exclusive.""

At this point Farage is nothing more than a spoiler dead set on undermining the effort to free the nation not only from the EU but also the massive demographic change that the globalists are bringing about through mass immigration from third world hell holes.
The motivation for bringing in people from third world hell holes should be self evident. They are people who come from such an awful place they are willing to settle for less. The hell holes they come from are hell holes because extreme government corruption and abuse of power is a way of life there.
This is why in Farage's world view immigrants from Poland are less desirable than immigrants from the Maghreb, The Poles have in their living memory experience with Nazi totalitarianism, Stalinist totalitarianism, have had enough of it and want something better."

Then Jacinda Ardern, the Prime Minister of New Zealand, denigrating women everywhere by kowtowing to Islamic misogyny by wearing a hijab.
Theresa May actually tops both of above fools by ignoring the wishes of her own party and getting into bed with a mentally questionable out-and-out communist.
Notice a pattern here? I did too.
Females have not evolved for leadership. They’ve evolved to rear kids. Notice the three above, they decide to do something and, without a second thought or asking advice, just went and did it. This is what dictators do. Or a mother in a kitchen with four to eight kids bawling at her.
In the home with five or six children the mother is a dictator and sometimes a despot. And on a lot of occasions she needs to be. She shouts at one kid, “You smashed that, now, go to your room and you’re getting no supper”.
She might realise soon afterwards that she punished the wrong child, that it was another one that did the smashing. But she can’t show weakness by admitting she was wrong, and besides, she hasn’t the time. So she’ll leave the innocent lad in his room and make up an excuse and punish the real transgressor for something else.
As any child will tell you, these are the actions of a tyrant, a despot.
Put the typical woman in political leadership and she brings these qualities with her. She can’t help it; it’s encoded in her DNA. Millions of years of evolution where the female reared the children and washed out the cave ensured that women are dictatorish and despotic with a mental range that’s incapable of handling any more than about 25 children on any one day.
They are a completely incapable species in the leading of governments."

‘Star Wars Battlefront 2’ Update 1.29 Fixes Capital Supremacy - Patch Notes,www.newsweek.com,,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsweek.com/star-wars-battlefront-2-update-129-capital-supremacy-patch-notes-1384486,"On 4/3/19 at 6:22 AM EDT Share Gaming Star Wars Battlefront II Star Wars Battlefront Patch Notes Gaming
Star Wars Battlefront 2 got a hotfix Wednesday morning that’s largely designed to fix bugs in the new Capital Supremacy game mode. Anakin Skywalker also got a pretty sizable nerf as well. Read the full patch notes below courtesy of a DICE forum post.
Star Wars Battlefront 2 Update 1.29 Patch Notes
'Star Wars Battlefront 2' update 1.29 fixes glitches in Capital Supremacy. DICE/EA Added fail-safe scripts to reduce the chances of unreactive spawning when transitioning between Ground and Capital Ship phases in Capital Supremacy. Additional server logging has been implemented to further diagnose spawning issues. Added tentative fixes for online AI causing server crashes on Capital Supremacy. Fixed a rendering issue that would occasionally cause the client to crash. Balanced damage and cooldown values for Anakin’s abilities: Reduced Retribution choke damage (86->75 points per second) Reduced Retribution push damage (80->75 points per second) Reduced Passionate Strike first damage (50->40) Reduced Passionate Strike last damage (150->130) Increased Passionate Strike cooldown (12->13) Reduced Heroic Might base damage (100->70) Balanced damage values for Infiltrator weapons: Lowered Power Blast damage (150->140) to prevent One-Hit Kills against Assault, Officer & Specialist Raised E-5 end damage (21->30) to increase the weapon's effective range Fixed an issue where players who join an ongoing match would occasionally get no audio during the boarding cinematic in Capital Supremacy. Fixed an issue that would prevent the ARC Trooper from gaining progress when playing on Phase 1 maps (Kamino and Geonosis - Trippa Hive). Fixed an issue where Darth Maul’s Choke Hold ability would occasionally be inaccurately activated from a distance when being used at the same time as another Hero's ability. Fixed an issue that prevented players from completing the Scoped achievement when playing as a Specialist, when fulfilling the criteria against AI on Capital Supremacy. Fixed an issue where Rey and Finn’s ability UI for the Insight and Undercover abilities would not always be fully visible. Revised the ping color of the ARC Trooper’s Helmet Scanner ability for consistency. Fixed an issue where Geonosians would occasionally be seen flying through the ground on Geonosis - Pipeline Junction West.
The Capital Supremacy mode for Star Wars Battlefront 2 didn’t end up being quite as exciting as some fans had hoped, but it also didn’t help that its release was marred by a few very frustrating bugs. The deployment issues listed at the top of the notes were one of the most troublesome glitches of all, so it’s good to know those problems have finally been fixed. As for Anakin, he was buffed during last month’s major update alongside several other saber wielders. These changes are a slight course correction to ensure the Chosen One doesn’t become too overpowered.
Today’s hotfix for Star Wars Battlefront 2 is the latest pitstop in DICE’s evolving roadmap for this controversial game. In an official roadmap update Tuesday morning, developers confirmed that several new locations will be added to the Capital Supremacy rotation alongside a mechanical rework in May. Other major features are also expected but not yet announced.
Star Wars Battlefront 2 is available on PS4, Xbox One and PC. The latest update is rolling out on all platforms.
What are your thoughts on the 1.29 update for Star Wars Battlefront 2 ? Are you enjoying Capital Supremacy more after these fixes? Tell us in the comments section!"

"Judge Says It’s a ‘Fundamental Human Right’ for a Man to Have Sex With His Wife, and State Should ‘Monitor’ That",www.newsweek.com,,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsweek.com/husband-wife-sex-right-consent-rape-judge-uk-england-high-court-anthony-paul-1384429,"A British judge has come under fire for claiming there exists a “fundamental human right” for a man to have sex with his wife.
England and Wales High Court judge Sir Anthony Paul Hayden made the comments while considering a case at the Court of Protection. He was asked to impose a court order prohibiting a man from having sex with his wife, who lawyers had argued may no longer be able to give her consent because of her worsening learning difficulties.
The woman’s condition had deteriorated to the point she could no longer consent to sex with her husband of 20 years, local social service officials had argued. Lawyers for the social services argued that a court order may thus be needed to ensure the woman was not raped, The Guardian explained. The husband had offered to pledge not to have sex with his wife.
Before making a ruling—which is expected in the coming months—Hayden said he wished to examine all the evidence in detail and hear arguments from lawyers representing the woman, her husband, and the local council involved. The judge also said the couple may not be identified in the media reports of the case, The Independent explained.
In the preliminary hearing, Hayden suggested that by accepting the man's undertaking not to have sex with his wife or by imposing a court order preventing him from doing so, the court could put the man in a situation where he faced a prison term for having sex with his wife. Hayden also noted that such a situation would be extremely difficult to monitor and police.
“I cannot think of any more obviously fundamental human right than the right of a man to have sex with his wife—and the right of the state to monitor that,” he told the court. “I think he is entitled to have it properly argued.”
Hayden’s comments were quickly seized upon by Labour Party politician Thangam Debbonaire, who on Twitter warned the judge was encouraging misogyny and trvializing rape. “This legitimises misogyny and woman-hatred,” Debbonaire wrote. “No man in the U.K. has such a legal right to insist on sex. No consent = rape.
“This judge is giving out a dangerous set of messages in his pronouncements. The individual case sounds complex and needs careful thought. But no judge should give out this sort of misogynist and inaccurate message. What it says about his values is awful—more important human right than right to bodily integrity? Really?” said Debbonaire.
