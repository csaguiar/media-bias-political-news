Advertisement Dem Aide Pleads Guilty In Kavanaugh Smear Job, Goes Straight To Jail
The fallout from the Brett Kavanaugh smear job continues and at least one person, a former top Dem aide, is going to jail.
He will not be the last, you can be sure of that, for at least we know Avenatti will be going away to the big house soon.
And with all the criminal referrals Chuck Grassley made, we can expect more charges and more jail time.

The polls show that the Right will not have a majority that will allow Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to form the next government, the Likud leader warned Sunday, two days before the polls open for Knesset elections.“I was here in 1999 and I currently see a similar problem,” Netanyahu said in a meeting of mayors who support the Likud. “If we don’t change the trend, we will lose.” Netanyahu said 61 Knesset seats’ worth of recommendations to President Reuven Rivlin are not guaranteed, because Zehut leader Moshe Feiglin refuses to commit to one side.“President Rivlin said something simple. If there aren’t 61 recommendations, then the largest party wins and forms the government. We don’t have 61…If there is no [majority right-wing] bloc, then [Blue and White Leaders Yair] Lapid and [Benny] Gantz are the biggest party, according to the polls in the media and according to our polls,” the prime minister warned.Netanyahu warned that the gap between Blue and White and Likud is even larger among voters who say they are certain about their vote.According to Netanyahu, in 2015, “the media did not hide its happiness that the Left was going to win,” which motivated people to vote for the Right, but this time, “Lapid and Gantz are going to win, but the media learned its lesson and is trying to put our people to sleep and are saying the Likud will win.“Since when does the media encourage the Likud? When they want us to lose,” he argued.Netanyahu repeated his promise that he will form a government with the smaller right-wing parties, including Zehut, and that Gantz will try to form a left-wing coalition with Labor and Meretz and support from Arab parties.The meeting between mayors and Netanyahu was called an “emergency,” and he strongly encouraged the mayors to try to “wake people up,” convince them to vote, make sure the Likud is the biggest party and “save the right-wing government.”Netanyahu held a subsequent meeting with West Bank mayors and local council heads, and made similar remarks.

The United States is aware of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s plans to annex West Bank settlements and his rejection of full Palestinian statehood, Netanyahu told Israeli media on Sunday as he continued to expand on his historic announcement regarding Israeli sovereignty.In an interview with Arutz 7, Netanyahu spoke of a three-stage plan with regard to the West Bank, the third stage of which “is to apply Israeli law to the communities in Judea and Samaria, which we will do in the next term. I want to do it gradually. I want to do it if possible with American support.” When pressed whether the White House knew of his plans, Netanyahu said, “Sure.” Asked about the Trump administration’s response to the plan, he answered, “They will react as they will react. We will see. These are my principles.”Netanyahu reiterated his pledge not to uproot settlements or settlers. “If we do not tear out the settlers, then who are they going to live under? They are going to be under Palestinian sovereignty? That is dead.”Those who live in the settlements, “will be under Israeli sovereignty,” he said.In an interview with Army Radio, the prime minister clarified that he does not intend to annex all of the West Bank, just the places in Area C where the settlements are located.The Palestinians will govern themselves, but they will not have security control, he added.“A Palestinian state will not be created, not like the one people are talking about. It won’t happen.”When Netanyahu first took office in 2009, he gave a foreign policy speech at Bar-Ilan University in which he spoke of his support for an Israeli and Palestinian state living side by side. He did not define the borders of that entity, and was careful to explain that his vision was of a demilitarized Palestinian state.Prior to the last election, Netanyahu said he did not believe a Palestinian state would be created during his next government.On Sunday, he told Arutz 7: “The Palestinians can have all the powers to govern themselves, but none to threaten us, which means we maintain security control. We don’t uproot anyone. We don’t divide Jerusalem.“My friend [former US vice president] Joe Biden, who may be running for the presidency of the US [in 2020], said, ‘Bibi, that is not a state. That is not sovereignty.’ I said, ‘Joe, you call it what you will. This is what it is. These are my positions. I am not changing these positions.”PLO Secretary-General Saeb Erekat and other Palestinian officials on Sunday strongly condemned Netanyahu’s talk about annexation and the dangers of a Palestinian state.Erekat said he was not surprised by Netanyahu’s remarks. Israel, he said, “will continue to brazenly violate international law for as long as the international community will continue to reward Israel with impunity, particularly with the Trump administration’s support and endorsement of Israel’s violation of the national and human rights of the people of Palestine.”Ahmed Majdalani, a PLO Central Council member and former Palestinian Authority minister, said Netanyahu’s statement requires more than expressions of concern and condemnation from the international community. He claimed that Trump’s recent decision to recognize Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights and other measures taken by the US administration, as well as Netanyahu’s remarks, are in the context of the upcoming peace plan, dubbed the “deal of the century.”“After all these steps that are imposed on the ground, where will the Palestinian state be established?” Majdalani asked. “Which two-state solution will they be talking about?”Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan’s spokesman, Ibrahim Kalin, said on Sunday that Western democracies must take a stand against Netanyahu’s words.“Will Western democracies react or will they keep appeasing? Shame on them all,” Kalin said.“[This is] yet another example of how Netanyahu uses electoral politics to justify occupation and undermine the two-state solution. If he is reelected, will this be a triumph of democracy or occupation?”Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu tweeted, “West Bank is Palestinian territory occupied by Israel in violation of [international] law. Prime Minister Netanyahu’s irresponsible statement to seek votes just before the Israeli general elections cannot and will not change this fact.”

Liberman files High Court petition demanding end to rabbinate's DNA tests,www.jpost.com,,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Liberman-files-High-Court-petition-demanding-end-to-rabbinates-DNA-tests-586016,"2 minute read. b Former Defense Minister Avigdor Liberman launches Yisrael Beitenu on January 20, 2019.

Yisrael Beytenu chairman Avigdor Liberman personally filed a petition to the High Court of Justice on Sunday which demands that the Chief Rabbinate and the rabbinical courts cease using DNA testing as a way of helping to prove Jewish status.Last month, Chief Rabbi David Lau acknowledged that DNA tests are sometimes used in a small number of cases to help determine the Jewish status of individuals for whom the rabbinical court is not convinced are in fact Jewish. The tests are controversial however since they cannot definitively prove Jewish status, only act as an aide, although some rabbinical courts have refused to register marriage for individuals refusing to them.ITIM, a religious services NGO, says it has seen approximately 20 cases in recent months where the rabbinical courts have requested DNA testing for individuals seeking to prove they are Jewish, mostly for the purposes of registering for marriage.Yisrael Beytenu said Liberman had filed the petition after he had requested the Chief Rabbinate halt their use but was rebuffed.Three women were party to the petitions along with Yisrael Beytenu, all of whom are immigrants from the former Soviet Union who had been requested by the rabbinical courts to do the DNA tests, despite according to the party the fact that “their Jewishness had been proved in the past through various means.”The petition was filed against the chief rabbis, the Council of the Chief Rabbinate, the Rabbinical Courts Administration, the Religious Services Ministry, and the Interior Ministry.“It is outrageous to hear that only immigrants from the former Soviet Union are suspected time after time by the rabbinical courts that they are ‘non-Jews,’” said Liberman.“They are even forced to go through these discriminatory, humiliating, and disgraceful DNA tests in order to prove their Jewishness. Forcing people who immigrated from a certain region to do these tests cannot be allowed to become something normal.”The Chief Rabbinate argues that no one is forced to undergo these tests, but Liberman and others have pointed out that the only way to marry in Israel is through the Chief Rabbinate. By refusing to register such people for marriage unless they do a genetic test the institution is essentially forcing them to take the tests.“We would never force someone to do this though,” Chief Rabbi David Lau said in March.“And it should be emphasized that a DNA test is not used to determine Jewish status in accordance with Jewish law and only to assist in the clarification [process].”

Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) has blamed former New York state judge Jeanine Pirro for why Rep. (D-MI) Ilhan Omar received death threats.On Friday, New York resident, 55-year-old Patrick Carlineo, was arrested for allegedly making threats against Omar's life, according to a press release from the US Attorney’s office. On Sunday morning, Ocasio-Cortez tweeted in response to the arrest that when Pirro rallies people against hijabs and makes them think they ""are threatening.""""Understand when Jeanine Pirro goes on Fox + rallies people to think hijabs are threatening, it leads to this,"" she wrote. ""Folks who imply we’re 'bad' for politics, the party, the country, etc. have no idea the threats we deal w/ because of that kind of language. ""Talk policy, not personal,"" Ocasio-Cortez added.

On March 9, Pirro blasted Omar for questioning the loyalty of American Jews to the United States by rhetorically asking if her Muslim faith means she is more loyal to Sharia law than the US constitution.""Omar wears a hijab which according to the Quran 33:59 tells women to cover so they won't get molested. Is her adherence to this Islamic doctrine indicative of her adherence to Sharia law which in itself is antithetical to the United States constitution?""Following the comments, Fox strongly condemned her remarks saying that ""they do not reflect those of the network and we have addressed the matter with her directly.""On March 21, Carlineo allegedly called Omar's office, asking a staff member who answered the call, “Do you work for the Muslim Brotherhood?” the man threatened. “Why are you working for her? She’s a (expletive). I’ll put a bullet in her (expletive) skull.”Carlineo faces up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine if convicted, the U.S. Department of Justice said. He made an initial court appearance on Friday and is being held pending a detention hearing on April 10.Meanwhile, also on Sunday morning, Omar shared a tweet from journalist Aaron Rupar who posted a video from US President Donald Trump's address to Republican Jews this weekend in which he critiqued her dislike for Israel. رَبِّ اغْفِرْ لِقَوْمِي فَإِنَّهُمْ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَMy Lord, forgive my people for they do not know. https://t.co/mtEzMrCLKF — Ilhan Omar (@IlhanMN) April 7, 2019 Rupar captioned the tweet: ""On the same day that one of his fans was charged with plotting to murder her, President Trump gratuitously attacks Ilhan Omar,"" to which Omar responded with a quote from the Quran, ""My Lord, forgive my people for they do not know.""

 held a meeting with activists from Israel’s gay and transgender community for the first time in 10 years on Sunday, promising to take action to help them – to a point.“I hear you,” Netanyahu said at the meeting in his residence in Jerusalem. “I will act for you. I think it’s a humane step to take.” However, the activists said the prime minister stopped short of committing to setting equal rights for LGBT Israelis as a condition for any coalition agreement, expressing concern that religious parties will not agree to it.Netanyahu called the problems of LGBT youth “the most acute, the most heartbreaking,” and repeated his commitment to keep the education portfolio for a Likud minister, as opposed to more conservative parties.Likud MK Amir Ohana, who is gay, said the meeting set an important precedent.“Likud plans to act to continue to promote LGBT issues. The bigger Likud is, the less it will have to depend on small parties that hold different views,” he said.Likud Pride chairman Evan Cohen said “the prime minister and his wife emphasized the most central issue – the community’s youth and the difficulties they face. The prime minister’s goal to keep the education portfolio with the Likud can allow a great battle against homophobia in general and specifically protect our youth.”LGBT rights organizations formed a joint elections task force after this week’s election was called, and have met with the leaders of all non-religious parties that have passed the threshold in polls, except for Yisrael Beytenu chairman Avigdor Liberman.Ohad Hizki, Director-General of The Aguda – Israel’s LGBT Task Force, said “there is political and public importance to the existence of a direct dialogue with the prime minister, and we hope the nice and positive statements we heard today will be translated into legislation in the coming term and into standing for our right to equality, and will not turn into empty promises like we have heard so far.”Elisha Alexander, director-general of the transgender rights organization Ma’avarim, said Netanyahu was unfamiliar with the issues facing transgender and gender-queer people and expressed hope for a change after he learned of discrimination against them in the workplace and their high suicide rate.Last year, the gay community protested against a law that expanded the right to hire a surrogate to carry a fetus to single women, as opposed to only married women, effectively allowing gay women to use surrogacy services, but not men. Netanyahu promised to change the law to include men, as well, but then voted against it.Blue and White’s spokesman said that Netanyahu is continuing to lie to LGBT Israelis, citing the surrogacy issue.“As [Blue and White leader] Benny Gantz promised in his meeting with gay community representatives, a government under his leadership will not allow any party in the coalition the veto power against promoting gay rights,” the party stated. “Therefore, the choice is clear: Bibi’s dark government…or a Blue and White government that will put an end to discrimination.”Labor’s gay members’ group said “Netanyahu embraces the darkest and most inciting factors in Israeli society with one hand and reaches out his other hand to the leaders of the gay community’s struggle. This meeting is political spin…and only a fig leaf by a man who voted against gay rights for 10 years. The community is sick of the Likud disrespecting its rights.”

Blue and White leader Benny Gantz mocked Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s announcement that he intends to annex West Bank settlements after Tuesday’s election as “political spin.”Netanyahu made the announcement on Saturday night in what seen as part of an effort to woo voters from the Likud’s satellite parties on the Right. “I am not in favor of making strategic announcements as a trial balloon a few days before the election,” Gantz told Army Radio. “It is not real. He had 13 years to do it, and he didn’t do it. It is interesting that he decided to do it now out of all times.”Gantz said Netanyahu made the announcement because he is worried about being replaced as prime minister. He said he expected Netanyahu to make more announcements ahead of the election.Asked about his own plans for the West Bank, Gantz said: “I support attempting to reach a peace agreement with security and diplomatic principles in which the Jordan Valley is our eastern security border, Jerusalem is our capital and the settlement blocs are in our hands. Nothing would happen unilaterally.” Gantz said that if Netanyahu knows what is in the diplomatic plan that US President Donald Trump has been working on, he should reveal it to the public.

According to a release by the project, a third of the removed Temple Mount soil remained unsifted and is in danger of being lost by erosion. “Due to this urgent situation, the project's directors made the decision to resume the sifting,” it said in a statement. The sifting project began in 2004, five years after the Israeli Northern Branch of the Islamic movement and the Islamic Waqf conducted illegal and destructive excavation work at the south-east corner of the Temple Mount, removing some 9,000 tons of antiquities-rich earth from the area and dumping it in the nearby Kidron Valley. The project was spearheaded by Dr. Gabriel Barkay and Zachi Dvira, who transferred the soil to the Tzurim Valley National Park and established a sifting facility in order to recover the ancient artifacts hidden in the soil and conduct in-depth research aimed at shedding new light on the history of the Temple Mount. So far, the project has unearthed more than half-a-million artifacts. According to the release, from 2005 to 2017, the project operated in cooperation with the City of David Foundation. Today, the Temple Mount Sifting Project is under the auspices of Bar-Ilan University’s Institute of Archaeology, and funded by private donors and philanthropic foundations via the Israel Archaeology Foundation and its crowdfunding website. In 2017, the sifting part of the project took a break in order to focus on research. The plan, according to Dvira, was to have a break of several years. However, “We noticed that the remaining unsifted soil is in danger of erosion by the elements and mixing with other illegal dumps of garbage at its current location.” Dvira said that The Muslim Waqf continues to perform unauthorized movement of earth. For example, in June, Palestinians did some renovations in the eastern area of the Temple Mount near the contested Golden Gate. The renovations were done manually and did not draw the attention of the Israeli police. Although, since then, police are aware and guarding the area, damage had been already done. “We realized that the soil there is also in immediate danger and should be sifted after determining the controlled archaeological method by which it will be removed from the Temple Mount,” Dvira explained. The sifting will now take place at a new compound at Mitzpeh Hamasuot.

Last week the remains of Sgt. Zachary Baumel, an Israeli soldier who went missing during the First Lebanon War, were repatriated to Israel after 37 years. The extraordinary story culminated in an emotional burial after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attended an official Russian Defense Ministry ceremony on April 4 in Moscow.The Russian statement on the handover provides an insight into Moscow’s view of the importance of this ceremony. A statement published by the Russian Embassy in Tel Aviv notes that Russia is searching for remains of fallen Red Army soldiers who fought against the Nazis in the Second World War. The remains of 120,000 Soviet soldiers have been found. “I believe the same fate befell Israeli serviceman Zachary Baumel,” Russian President Vladimir Putin said. “Our military personnel and their Syrian partners helped find Zachary’s remains.” It was a difficult mission, he added.It is highly unusual for a third country to find the remains of an Israeli soldier, and for Russia to help repatriate them. It was also a complex operation that goes back at least two years. According to a report on Ynet, the families of the missing, including those of two other missing IDF soldiers, approached then chief of staff Gadi Eisenkot to “push for new information on their loved ones in light of strong ties with Russia.”But what’s important here is the dignity Russia sought to accord this mission and the handover. It is part of a wider Russian interest in positioning itself as the key player in the Middle East, and presenting itself as a responsible country that one can go to in order to achieve things. This is in contrast to the way Russia is perceived in some Western political and media circles, which portray Moscow as being behind troll farms, bot networks, hacking, election collusion and even poisoning dissidents.The two faces of Moscow may not be mutually exclusive. Moscow has presented a consistent and clear line regarding its policies in the Middle East. It wants stability and territorial integrity of states, and it has argued that the chaos unleashed by the Arab Spring and the rise of various extremist or jihadist groups are a threat to the region and the world. Of course this is not because Moscow is just a benevolent country looking out for the region’s best interests. It has its allies and its clear interests. Its allies are often a legacy of Cold War alliances. So Bashar Assad’s regime in Syria is a Moscow ally because it always has been. Countries that are critical of the West, or authoritarian regimes tend toward connections with Russia, whether that is Maduro’s Venezuela, or Iran, or increasingly, Turkey.Russia also wants to carve out closer relations with countries that are US allies, including Egypt, Israel and Saudi Arabia. All of these relationships may have different interests for Russia. And there is no reason to doubt that Putin’s relationship with Netanyahu is not one of genuine respect and warmth as it appears to have been over the last years. And the relationships are mutually beneficial for different reasons. Egypt and Saudi Arabia both felt put out in the cold by the Obama administration, and Israel was nonplussed by the Iran deal. Russia’s role in Syria made it a go-to for Jerusalem on Syria issues when the US was increasingly incapable of setting an agenda regarding the Syrian regime.Russia’s role is also complex. For instance, Russia’s stance on Libya is particularly interesting. In recent days, Libyan National Army leader Khalifa Haftar launched an offensive against the Syrian capital of Tripoli. Haftar’s forces have expanded their control from eastern Libya and now are poised to unify the country after eight years of civil war. Russia paid lip service to supporting a UN settlement. The UN backs the Tripoli government and opposes Haftar’s advance. But Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on Saturday that Moscow would not apportion blame in Libya. “We keep a close eye on the armed forces’ advance, including the Libyan National Army and other groups, including those which are illegal armed groups and control a considerable part of the country’s capital and some other areas,” Lavrov said. Haftar has also said that he will take Tripoli from “terrorists and armed groups.” It’s not a surprise that Haftar’s language appears to be similar to Moscow’s. In the end, the Tripoli government is supported by the West, and Moscow likely sees Tripoli as a hot-bed of instability and extremism, whereas Haftar represents stability and centralized leadership.One could see the Baumel repatriation as a unique incident with no larger context. But there are good reasons to see it as part of a general trend of Russia portraying itself as the reliable and consistent actor in the Middle East. It has played the same role in the Astana talks and in Sochi, in hosting Turkey and Iran to discuss Syria. At each step the US is not involved, as Russia positions itself as a “go-to” power for the region.Russia also wants to set down some red lines eventually. Lavrov told Egypt’s Al-Ahram that Russia wants to prevent an upsurge in tensions” in Syria, in reference to a question about Israeli shelling Syrian territory. Lavrov didn’t mention Israel, but the headline at the Tass Russian News Agency noted that Russia’s stance on “inadmissibility of Israeli shelling” remained unchanged.Another message of Moscow’s role in the Baumel repatriation is that Russia has unprecedented access to Syria and might mollify the Syrian regime on some issues. That might have ramifications for Israel’s desire to see Iranian influence reduced in Syria. Baumel’s remains could have been returned in a quiet, seemingly clandestine, manner. Instead, the public ceremony shows that Russia wants to be perceived as an honest broker able to help in these sensitive manners.

The stars of the popular Turkish soap opera The Bride of Istanbul arrived in Israel on Friday, and were greeted as heroes by thousands of local fans.The TV show, officially titled Instanbullu Gellin , has become nothing short of a sensation in Israel. And Israeli companies are capitalizing on that fact. Earlier this year, the fashion brand Castro brought one of the show’s stars, Berkay Hardal, to film an ad campaign in Israel. Last month, both HOT and Yes launched channels dedicated to airing just episodes of the soap opera. And on Friday, the show’s two leads, Ozcan Deniz and Asli Enver, touched down in Tel Aviv for two concerts at the Menora Mivtahim Arena. Deniz attended a fan meet-and-greet in Herzliya before his first show, where he was mobbed by fans. שוב טורקי מנצח ביד אליהו. קבלו את אוז׳גן דניז, פארוק מהכלה באיסטנבול pic.twitter.com/EM7NtfH4qx — Raz Shechnik (@RazShechnik) April 6, 2019 And at the arena on Saturday evening, he discovered more than 10,000 adoring people in the crowd. Concert organizers added a second show on Sunday evening after the first one sold out.“You discovered here a show that we film in Turkey, and again, art has won out,” Deniz said on stage, alongside a Hebrew interpreter. “What the politicians haven’t succeeded in doing, this time we succeeded. I thank you so much, and hopefully, many other things in the realm of art that we do can help bring us together.”Deniz performed his wide repertoire of Turkish songs as the mostly-female crowd shouted “Faruk, Faruk”– the name of his character in the show. Enver, his co-star and on-screen wife, Sureyya, joined him for just one song on stage. Toward the end of the show, Deniz, who appeared to never utter the word “Israel,” issued another call for peace.“Tel Aviv is a very beautiful city,” he said. “And I am waiting for all of you to come visit us in Turkey.”

"IfNotNow activists interrupt Trump speech, denounce 'plague of occupation'",www.jpost.com,,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.jpost.com/Diaspora/IfNotNow-activists-interrupt-Trump-speech-denounce-plague-of-occupation-586009,"1 minute read. b People organized by IfNotNow protest outside of Trump International Hotel against the new U.S. Embassy opening in Jerusalem in Washington, US, May 14, 2018.

Ten members of the hard-left IfNotNow organization interrupted US President Donald Trump’s speech at a Republican Jewish Coalition (RJC) event in Las Vegas on Saturday, chanting slogans against Israel’s control of the West Bank and white supremacism as the president began his speech.The small group chanted “Jews are here to say Occupation is a plague,” and “Jews are here to say white nationalism is a plague,” riffing off the upcoming Jewish holiday of Passover, which recalls the Biblical account of the ten plagues brought upon the ancient Egyptians as well as the Israelite exodus from Egypt. One of the IfNotNow activists was wearing a T-shirt bearing a swastika crossed out and the word “Destroy” above it, evidently an implicit accusation against Trump and/or Israel of Nazism or fascism.The activists’ chants soon drew boos and counter chants of “USA, USA.” They were swiftly escorted out by security officials.The group issued a statement following the incident saying that RJC’s support for Trump and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu runs counter to “Jewish moral tradition” because of the two leaders’“racist, violent agendas” which they said pose a threat to “people around the world” and the American Jewish community.“We took action today two weeks before the Jewish holiday of Passover, when Jews are commanded to remember the bitterness of slavery and our own oppression,” the activists said.“Trump is a modern-day Pharaoh, and IfNotNow calls on our community to reject the plagues of occupation and white nationalism.”The activists accused Trump and the Republican Party of having “incited and emboldened racist and white nationalist violence in this country,” culminating with the shooting at the Pittsburgh Tree of Life synagogue, which left 11 Jews dead.IfNotNow describes itself as an anti-occupation organization, but activists have refused to say whether or not they support the existence in any form of a Jewish state.

Zacks Investment Research Lowers Infosys (INFY) to Sell,www.dailypolitical.com,Patrick Bannon,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailypolitical.com/2019/04/07/zacks-investment-research-lowers-infosys-infy-to-sell.html,"Janney Montgomery Scott Lowers Mid-America Apartment Communities (MAA) to Neutral Zacks Investment Research Lowers Infosys (INFY) to Sell April 7th, 2019 - Comments Off on Zacks Investment Research Lowers Infosys (INFY) to Sell - Filed Under - by Patrick Bannon Tweet
Zacks Investment Research downgraded shares of Infosys (NYSE:INFY) from a hold rating to a sell rating in a research note released on Wednesday, Zacks.com reports.
According to Zacks, “Infosys is suffering an unfavorable political climate in the United States and the increasing anti-outsourcing sentiment in certain countries. Notably, higher subcontractor costs and the company’s compensation revision with a higher variable pay and incentives, are an overhang on the margins. Further, the company’s business is highly prone to the currency volatility between the Indian rupee and the U.S. dollar as majority of its revenues are derived from the U.S. markets. However, Infosys is benefiting from solid deal wins, geographical expansions and business segmental growth. The company’s focus on Agile Digital and AI-driven Core services is a tailwind. Higher spending on the digital, analytics, cloud, cybersecurity and other new technology domains is a key driver for the company. Shares have outperformed the industry in the past year. Estimates have been stable ahead of the company's Q4 earnings release.” Get Infosys alerts:

Zacks Investment Research upgraded shares of Nokia Oyj (NYSE:NOK) from a sell rating to a hold rating in a research report sent to investors on Thursday morning, Zacks.com reports.
According to Zacks, “Nokia’s significant international presence exposes it to political and economic disruptions, all of which can directly impact its top line and profitability. Presently, when Europe’s economy is highly unpredictable post the Brexit referendum, it becomes difficult for the company to increase revenues and minimize expenses. Moreover, Nokia is likely to be stifled by the renegotiated deals and restrictions imposed on trade with other European Union members, lowering its productivity. However, Nokia intends to accelerate strategy execution, sharpen customer focus and reduce long-term costs to improve its performance. The company is continuously expanding its business into targeted, high-growth and high-margin vertical markets to address growth opportunities beyond its traditional primary markets. The stock has also outperformed the industry in the past year on average.” Get Nokia Oyj alerts:

Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said Sunday that Democrats will ""never"" see President Trump Donald John Trump Trump to stage tax-day event in Minnesota Dem senator presses Pompeo: 'Do you believe our country is full?' Bipartisan senators offer bill to expand electric vehicle tax credit MORE 's tax returns. ""Nor should they. That’s an issue that was already litigated during the election. Voters knew the president could have given his tax returns, they knew that he didn’t, and they elected him anyway,"" Mulvaney said during an appearance on ""Fox News Sunday."" ADVERTISEMENT He added that Democrats ""know they're not going to"" get the tax returns. ""They just want attention on the issue because they don’t want to talk to us about policy,"" he said. Last week, House Democrats formally requested Trump's tax returns , with Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal (D-Mass.) asking IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig to turn over six years of Trump's personal and business tax returns. One of Trump's personal lawyers later urged the IRS not to release the tax returns, arguing that Democrats can't legally request them. Neal made the request under a provision of the federal tax code that states the Treasury secretary ""shall furnish"" tax returns upon request from the chairmen of Congress’s tax committees, provided that the documents associated with a particular taxpayer are viewed in a closed session. Trump has said repeatedly that he won't release his returns because he is under audit. The IRS says it does not prevent individuals from releasing their personal returns. Mulvaney added Sunday that Democrats ""know what the law is."" ""They know one of the fundamental principles of the IRS is to protect the confidentiality of you and me and everybody else who files taxes. They know that. They know the terms under law by which the IRS can give them the documents, but political hit job is not one of those reasons,"" he said."

In addition, there is a development boom of self-storage units in many markets. This high supply will likely fuel competition for the company, curb its power to raise rents and turn on more discounting. Moreover, the trend in estimate revisions for 2019 funds from operations (FFO) per share does not indicate a favorable outlook for the company. Nevertheless, it enjoys presence in key cities and opts for strategic joint ventures to drive long-term profitability.

In the current news media climate it’s easy to lose touch with the core economic issues that actually define Americans’ daily lives. When you type in “poll top ten issues for 2020” what Google produces is the latest on the candidates and ranking them on how much money they have raised.
They really fixate on the horserace because that’s their money maker and as huge corporations that thrive on the current status quo they prefer a personality contest that’s cheaper to produce and further inflates their profits. Even a cataclysm like climate change is lucky to break into the top five. Advertisement:
Questions They Don’t Ask
You rarely see pollsters include questions about how Americans feel about the enduring pay disparity between white men, white women, men of color and women of color for doing the same work.
If you are not a white guy and live every day of your working life with this disparity that you inherited from your parents your “legacy” is a pervasive economic injustice that you can trace back to America’s imperfect revolution.
When it comes to male pay the Pew Center found white men average $21 an hour while Black men get $15 and Hispanics $14.
When You Can’t Afford to Leave
When it comes to the home life, the vast gender-pay disparity casts a shadow over the choices millions of mothers have to make just to keep their kids fed and sheltered. It can mean enduring abusive and sometimes dangerous situations where they are putting up with an alcoholic or drug abusing spouse because he’s bringing home a paycheck they could never match. Advertisement:
In a capitalist society that values money above anything else, where the money goes defines who is in charge and who calls the shots. Women make-up nearly half of the workforce, outperform men in terms of academic achievement, yet according to the Institute for Women’s Policy Research make 80.5 cents for every dollar made by a man.
For women of color and women with children the gap opens up to a canyon that seems almost impossible to traverse.
According to IWPR, at the current glacial pace of progress, it will not be until 2059 for women to reach the promised land of pay parity. For Black women, it won’t be until 2119, while for their Hispanic sisters they won’t get there until 2224.
Now or Never Advertisement:
But looking around I sense a radical change in the air that indicates there’s a wave of female empowerment that’s more electric than a hashtag. It has the power to redeem the soul of this lost, alienated nation. Women are ascendant and they are just not going to be denied any longer.
All you have to do is look at the record shattering number of women elected in 2018 to the House of Representatives, a third of them for the first time. And even in the environs of New York State, where the state has been run for years by “three men in a room”— the Assembly Speaker, Senate Majority Leader and the Governor, after two of them were indicted and convicted for corruption there’s major change brewing.
Last week on the steps of New York City Hall hundreds of mostly female members of the Communications Workers of America Local 1180 rallied to celebrate a settlement they had reached with the City of New York for a generation of gender and race-based pay discrimination. Advertisement:
The $15 million settlement covers 1,600 active and retired Local 1180 members who were on the job from December of 2013 and 2017. The union’s big breakthrough came in April of 2015 the Federal EEOC found reasonable cause to believe that for years the city had engaged in wide spread discrimination against the women and people of color who held the civil service Administrative Manager title.
The finding covered every city agency. The EEOC found that there had been “structural and historic problems” in how the city treated the female and civil servants of color with the Administrative Manager title that resulted in their being paid “much less than their white male counterparts.’”
As part of the Local’s successful brief, it documented that in 1978, when the Administrative Manager title was mostly held by white males the job paid the equivalent of $92,000 a year, but in the years that followed when the women of Local 1180 started holding the same title the salary dropped to $53,000. The EECO estimated the disparity cost the women close to a $250 million in over a decade. Advertisement:
“Local 1180’s path to the finish line started more than two decades ago,” CWA Local 1180 President Gloria Middleton told a cheering crowd of union members and their supporters on the steps of City Hall on April 2. “It’s been a long path —a complicated path—a frustrating path. But today we can finally say it’s been a successful path.”
Upwardly Mobile
Standing next to Middleton was the newly elected New York State Attorney General Letitia James, who had been New York City Public Advocate.
“What a difference a year makes,” City Council Majority Leader Laurie Cumbo told the crowd. “When I look around all of the dynamic changes with our then Public Advocate become the New York State Attorney General [Letitia James] — when I see Crystal Peoples-Stokes, the Majority Leader of the Assembly — when I see Andrea Stewart Cousins [Senate Majority Leader] who has broken the barriers there — we now have three African-American women who are now majority leaders at the city and state level — positions that were previously held by white men.” Advertisement:
She continued, “We have broken the barrier of three men in a room . . . . I am so proud to be part of this herstory that we remake every single day. We knew, and always new these wage disparities were present.”
Rose Reeves is an Administrative Manager for Housing Preservation and Development with 36 years on the job. After the City Hall rally Ms. Reeves was somewhat philosophical about the settlement. Ms. Reeves calculates that over the arc of her long tenure she had lost out hundreds of thousands of dollars in potential lifetime earnings.
“I want to retire in three to four years,” she said. “So, before I retire we will hopefully see a change.” She said she was consoled by the knowledge that because of the union’s multi-year legal battle for pay equity “we are paying it forward” for all the women that come after the women gathered at City Hall and the thousands more they represent.
Pay Equity is Family Friendly Advertisement:
What’s really disconcerting is that the Federal Equal Pay Act has been on the books since 1963. A half-century later, where are we? Consider the research done by the University of Illinois that documents that single mothers make two-thirds of what single fathers make.
For too many American families headed by women, every day is like trying to run up the down escalator.
“There’s a societal assumption that mothers will be less reliable” because their first priority will be their children, according to Dr. Harriet Fraad , a family therapist who helps families cope with the impact of economic dislocation.
And Fraad observes that this rigid economic caste system, that helps keep millions of women and their children in poverty , comes in a country without any external societal support for families in general. Advertisement:
“Every other western democracy except for the U.S. supports families with family leave, childcare, after school programs and summer programs,” she says. “As a consequence, 75 percent of our school age children come home to an empty house and that happens to be the time of day that we see the highest percentage of crimes against children and of children committing crimes.”
For “moderates” like former Vice-President Joe Biden they just don’t get the fierce urgency of now on issues like pay disparity that the radical left embodies in firebrands like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.
They speak the same language but with a dialect of passion and urgency because they understand the grievance. They know in their bones the wasting of a generation that comes when these injustices are carried forward decade after decade and America is robbed of what it might yet be. Bob Hennelly

Fox wants President Trump to pardon Robert Mueller’s “victims”,www.salon.com,,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.salon.com/2019/04/07/fox-wants-president-trump-to-pardon-robert-muellers-victims_partner/,"Sean Hannity; Donald Trump (Getty/Saul Loeb/AP/Andrew Harnik) Fox wants President Trump to pardon Robert Mueller’s “victims” The Trump propaganda network’s clemency list includes Stone, Flynn, and Papadopoulos -- Your message has been sent successfully Send email to: //www.salon.com/2019/04/07/fox-wants-president-trump-to-pardon-robert-muellers-victims_partner/ Send April 7, 2019 12:29PM (UTC) This article originally appeared on Media Matters .
In President Donald Trump's first interview since the conclusion of special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation, Fox News host Sean Hannity asked the president whether he would consider pardoning campaign aides who pleaded guilty or were found guilty of crimes as part of the probe. The president demurred, saying that “many, many people were hurt, incredibly hurt by this whole scam,” but he doesn’t “want to talk about pardons now.”
After spending years undermining Mueller’s probe even as the special counsel obtained guilty pleas and verdicts against several top Trump campaign advisers, Fox personalities like Hannity have responded to the conclusion of the investigation last week by calling for pardons for Mueller’s so-called “victims.” Advertisement:
The network’s hosts have been particularly interested in obtaining pardons for former national security adviser Michael Flynn and former Trump campaign foreign policy aide George Papadopoulos, who both pleaded guilty to making false statements to the FBI, and for Trump confidant Roger Stone, who has been indicted on seven counts including lying to Congress and witness tampering.
These calls may end up having an impact — Trump regularly watches Fox and has previously issued pardons in response to the network’s programming.
Tucker Carlson has led the way, pushing for pardons on three different broadcasts of his show in the last week, particularly for Stone. Trump reportedly loves Carlson’s show and watches it regularly, and he often tweets about Carlson segments that catch his attention.
During Wednesday night’s show, just minutes before the president’s live interview on Hannity , former Trump campaign aide Michael Caputo concluded an interview by saying, “I just want to say one thing, Tucker: Pardon General Flynn, pardon George Papadopoulos, and pardon Roger Stone right now, Mr. President.”
“Immediately,” Carlson replied. “That's exactly right. I couldn’t agree with — don't wait until after the election, do it now. They deserve it now. Thank you.”
“Do it right now on Twitter,” Caputo responded. Advertisement:
“I agree! I agree!” Carlson said.
“Where are the pardons here? Carlson asked retired CIA officer John Kiriakou after mentioning Stone on Tuesday’s broadcast. “I mean, is it time for the executive branch to send a really clear message we're going to stop the destruction of innocent people by completely out of control bureaucrats?”
“I think it is the time for pardons,” Kiriakou replied.
Carlson later added that “it doesn't make sense not to pardon people” and said Trump has an “obligation” to do so since the Mueller probe was “a scam and a hoax.”
And on Friday, Carlson argued that “there was no collusion,” but “Stone is still looking at life in prison.” Carlson asked, “Where is Roger Stone's pardon? His pardon from the president? Let's hope it comes very soon.” Advertisement:
Later in the program, Carlson asked Ed Henry, who is both Fox News’ chief national correspondent and a co-host of ""Fox & Friends’"" weekend editions, whether Henry had heard that the president was considering a pardon for Stone. Henry replied that he had not, but that “based on the conversations I have had,” he thinks “it is entirely possible that you could see [former Trump campaign chair Paul] Manafort, Stone, and others pardoned.”
While Carlson has been the loudest Fox voice urging Trump to issue pardons, he is not the only one. On Tuesday, Papadopoulos announced that his lawyers had formally requested a pardon from the president, triggering debate on several of the network’s programs.
Fox’s Steve Hilton told ""Special Report"" guest host John Roberts that he would recommend Trump issue the pardon to ensure “fairness and equal justice.” Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) told Fox’s Neil Cavuto that the president should instead pardon Flynn, whose investigation Paul claimed had been “unfair.” And Fox Business’ Stuart Varney said that he expected pardons for both to be granted. Advertisement:
On Tuesday night, Papadopoulos was able to make his pitch to the president directly through a friendly interview with Fox’s Martha MacCallum.
“Do you think you’re going to get a pardon from President Trump?” MacCallum asked, after credulously allowing Papadopoulos to tell his story of purportedly being “set up.”
“I have no idea. I have no expectation for it,” he replied. “I know my lawyers have formally applied for one and if I'm granted one it would be a tremendous honor, and of course I would accept.” Advertisement:
“You already spent 12 days in federal prison, which I'm sure was not a picnic,” MacCallum responded. “But you'd like to have that off your record.”
If Trump is heeding the messages he’s been getting from Fox, Papadopoulos may get his wish. Matt Gertz"
