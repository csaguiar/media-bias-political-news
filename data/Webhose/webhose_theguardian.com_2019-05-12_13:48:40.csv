US natural history museum gala to honor Brazil's far-right president sparks outrage | World news | The Guardian,www.theguardian.com,Oliver Milman,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/12/american-museum-of-natural-history-gala-jair-bolsonaro,"Institution is ‘deeply concerned’ after being attacked for hosting event to honor Jair Bolsonaro who has rolled back environmental protections. The American Museum of Natural History has said it is “deeply concerned” after it was sharply criticized for hosting an event that will honour Jair Bolsonaro , the president of Brazil who has backed aggressive cuts in environmental protections .

Bolsonaro is set to be honoured at the annual Brazilian-American Chamber of Commerce black-tie gala, scheduled to take place at the Museum of Natural History in New York on 14 May.
The decision has caused outrage among activists dismayed at Bolsonaro’s rolling back of protections for the Amazon rainforest to usher in mining and logging companies despite protests from native groups. The rightwing president has also been condemned for views seen as misogynist and racist, as well as his praise for Brazil’s former military dictatorship.
“The fact that American Museum of Natural History would accept an event for something so counter to their own values, they should be ashamed themselves,” Priscila Neri, a Brazilian activist with the human rights group Witness, told Gothamist .
“In a moment when there’s been a rise of authoritarianism around the world, they’re giving a positive nod to a man who is rolling back human rights protections and scientific knowledge.”
Several museum employees and members have also attacked the institution for hosting Bolsonaro. In response, the museum said it was concerned and was reviewing the situation.
In a statement on Friday, the museum said: “The external, private event at which the current President of Brazil is to be honored, was booked at the Museum before the honoree was secured. We are deeply concerned, and the event does not in any way reflect the Museum’s position that there is an urgent need to conserve the Amazon Rainforest, which has such profound implications for biological diversity, indigenous communities, climate change, and the future health of our planet. We are exploring our options.”
The controversy is just the latest political storm to hit the museum. Last year, more than 200 scientists and academics urged the museum to cut its ties to board member Rebekah Mercer, a prominent donor to Donald Trump who has funded groups that deny the science of climate change.
A dinosaur wing of the museum is named after David Koch, a billionaire who has also attempted to undermine climate science and scupper regulations on greenhouse gas emissions.

Donald Trump has confirmed that he considered naming his daughter Ivanka Trump to head the World Bank, and also thinks she would have been a great UN ambassador.
In an interview with the Atlantic published on Friday, Trump was apparently quite eager to sing his daughter’s praises: the author writes that she requested an interview with Ivanka herself and was turned down, but instead got a call that the president wanted to talk to her.
'Ridiculous': report Ivanka Trump could lead World Bank meets scorn Read more
“I even thought of Ivanka for the World Bank … She would’ve been great at that because she’s very good with numbers,” Trump said.
“She’s a natural diplomat,” Trump said. “She would’ve been great at the United Nations, as an example.”
Asked why he didn’t nominate her, he said: “If I did, they’d say nepotism, when it would’ve had nothing to do with nepotism. But she would’ve been incredible.”
Trump sometimes calls Ivanka “baby” during official meetings, the magazine reports.
“If she ever wanted to run for president,” he said, “I think she’d be very, very hard to beat.”
In March last year, Ivanka Trump effectively acted, if briefly, as de facto interim secretary of state , after Rex Tillerson was fired. She also sat in for her father at a G20 summit in Hamburg in July 2017, to widespread consternation .
In his bombshell White House-insider bestseller Fire and Fury, the author Michael Wolff wrote that Ivanka Trump aspires to a higher achievement than an appointment from her father: to be the first female US president .
The US president does not have the final say on the World Bank appointment, which must be voted on by the bank’s board of directors. But presidential nominations have traditionally led to appointments.
The bank has historically been led by figures with multiple decades of governmental, macroeconomic or academic experience. All 12 presidents to date have been men.

The Guardian view on the Amritsar massacre centenary: time to see ourselves as others see us | Editorial | Opinion,www.theguardian.com,Editorial,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/12/the-guardian-view-on-the-amritsar-massacre-centenary-time-to-see-ourselves-as-others-see-us,"Editorial: Britain is too cautious about facing its complex past. The result is that Britain fails to understand its future. T heresa May did two significant things this week. The first, her decision to postpone Brexit, is the dominant story of the times. The second has received less attention. At prime minister’s questions, Mrs May prefaced her answers by talking about the “shameful scar on British Indian history” of the killings at Jallianwala Bagh in 1919 . “We deeply regret what happened and the suffering caused,” said Mrs May. When Jeremy Corbyn replied, he went further, calling for a “full, clear and unequivocal apology for what took place”.
These brief exchanges were a reminder of the long shadow cast by what is better known in Britain as the Amritsar massacre, whose centenary falls on Saturday. It is rare for a Conservative prime minister to express regrets for any aspect of British imperial history. So the fact that Mrs May said anything at all was noteworthy: first, as a sign of continuing official unease at the highest level about the events of 1919 and, second, as a recognition of the effect the massacre still exerts on the British-Indian relationship to this day.
Mr Corbyn’s response was significant too. By using the word “apology” he went further than any British leader has yet been willing to go. When the Queen laid a wreath at Amritsar in 1997, she called the massacre “distressing”. When David Cameron visited Jallianwala Bagh in 2013, he wrote in the visitors’ book that the events were “deeply shameful”. The difference between Mrs May’s and Mr Corbyn’s words was important, for this is a long and an unquiet argument that is not yet resolved.
The events of 13 April 1919 were terrible and, to this day, are insufficiently known in Britain. Imperial troops (made up of Gurkhas, Baluchis and probably some Sikhs) fired without prior warning into a peaceful crowd of more than 15,000 for 10 minutes. An official commission put the total of dead at 379, with more than a thousand injured, but the true figures may be higher. The shootings caused outrage and anti-British radicalisation in India. The effects on Gandhi were decisive. What took place at Jallianwala Bagh was never forgotten. The lieutenant-governor of Punjab at the time of the killings was assassinated in London in belated revenge as late as 1940. The 1919 killings do not stand alone . Others preceded and followed them. But Amritsar remains to this day the most potent embodiment of the violence on which British rule partly rested for nearly two centuries.
Liberal Britain was scandalised by Amritsar too. Winston Churchill (then a Liberal) said it was “a monstrous event” and “a slaughter”. The India secretary Edwin Montagu called it simply “terrorism”. But there were widespread and lasting efforts to whitewash and ignore what happened. Many in the Raj and in Britain, not least within the most reactionary wing of the Conservative party, approved of it wholeheartedly. When General Reginald Dyer, who ordered the shootings, died in 1927 he was given a military funeral in Somerset, followed by a second, ceremonial funeral in which his coffin, draped in the union jack, was wheeled through central London on a gun carriage as if he was a national hero. Dyer still has his defenders today.
The reluctance to apologise has many strands. They include concerns about precedent, legal consequences and claims for reparations. But the reluctance to look back dispassionately, understandable in some respects, is a national burden. It means Britain can fail to face historical facts, question ourselves as a modern nation and think about complexity. It can mean we fail to see ourselves as others see us. These are enduring issues, which cannot be brushed aside just because they are sometimes exploited opportunistically.
Some other countries are better at this self-examination. Germany is one. Belgium, which is trying to rethink its own imperial past , is another. Britain can learn from them. Britain lacks a shared or a sufficiently capacious version of its own history. Too many are not taught enough of it to make this possible. Outside the academy walls, and sometimes within them, the treatment of history can be too politicised, nationalistic and manichean. The result is that we don’t think properly or even know about events like Amritsar. But the result is also Brexit .

The Guardian view on the first picture of a black hole: seeing is believing | Editorial | Opinion,www.theguardian.com,Editorial,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/12/the-guardian-view-on-the-first-picture-of-a-black-hole-seeing-is-believing,"Editorial: Scientists have shown us one of the mysteries of the universe, and the extraordinary power of human cooperation. “I f you work on something like theoretical physics, you feel like you’re trapped inside a room, and outside people don’t know,” the physicist Carlo Rovelli said recently. While the stereotype of a space scientist is of a loner out of step with the humdrum of everyday life, Mr Rovelli is not alone in believing that his life’s work is not just to find things out, but to communicate.
This week’s first pictures of a black hole were a special moment for all those who believe that scientists’ role is not only to expand the sum of human knowledge, but to share it. Seeing is not always believing. But the fact that millions of us have seen the picture of the supermassive black hole at the heart of the Messier 87 galaxy, 55m light years away, is an undoubted step forward for humankind. Created using data gathered from eight telescopes in four continents, the fiery doughnut of red and gold with blackness at its centre has now been given a Hawaiian name: Powehi .
We have known about black holes since Einstein, but it was not until the 1960s that they were given that name (borrowed from British colonial history’s tale of an Indian prison, “the Black Hole of Calcutta”). Remarkable discoveries continue to be made in other fields: last month’s revelation of an enormous haul of fossils from the dawn of life on Earth 518m years ago is one example. But space has long held special status as the realm of science most awe-inspiring to humans. The distances are so immense; the physical laws so difficult to grasp (if you stood at the event horizon, as the black hole’s edge is known, the bending of light would mean that you could see the back of your own head). Beyond this, where light and matter disappear never to return, what happens? We have no means of finding out; these cosmic sinkholes are doors not just to the unknown – but to the unknowable, now and possibly forever.
It is too soon to say what the picture’s impact will be. “ Earthrise ”, probably the most influential space photograph, is credited with having taught us to see our planet as an oasis in a barren universe. The new image offers fresh proof of the infinite darkness that surrounds us; and of Einstein’s general theory of relativity. But perhaps the week’s most important lesson is in the extraordinary, globe-spanning effort that brought us the image. So distant is the Messier 87 galaxy that capturing it is said to have been equivalent to photographing a bagel on the moon. Teams from Spain to Antarctica worked together “to see what we thought was unseeable”, in the words of Event Horizon Telescope director, Sheperd Doeleman.
Humans are a destructive species. Such achievements remind us that we are also a creative one. Curiosity, cooperation, ingenuity and tenacity among our finest attributes. Cultivating and celebrating these, while recognising our smallness in the scheme of things, has never been more necessary.

Oy, shopkeep! This is too much gristle in me pasty, understand? What do you think this is? It'd take 10 jaws to chew a single bite. You call this a pasty, eh? This miserable excuse for a filling? Blimey, in Italy this pasty wouldn't be fed to the dogs!"

May not be there next season, but then neither may Hazard, Hudson-Odoi, Luiz, Abramovich etc."

I dont know what he's persona is like in the dressing room but you'd need a big presence in that dressing room I'd imagine. Ancelotti's pragmatism and ability to adapt served him well there for example, and he had the advantage of a fantastic reputation when he arrived. Chelsea's a weird club from the outside looking in theres probably too much player power and their seasons fluctuate wildly. But yeah the stick he was getting was over the top and recent form suggests the players are buying into what he's trying to do. Took a while for his Napoli team to click. As a total neutral in English football, I'd be really interested to see Chelsea actually trying to develop some more of these young players they've got - a transfer ban could be a blessing in disguise in the long term. Post Lampard/Terry/Drogba etc they dont seem to have as much of an identity as a team."

You were lucky to make it to your 30’s before you met this revelation, but rather than letting it rock your world and cast cynicism on your views of marriage, use it as a chance to appreciate that everyone is flawed, but it doesn’t make them any less worthy of your understanding and love."
