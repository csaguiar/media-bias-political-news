Prosecutors Dropping Child Porn Charges After Software Tools Are Questioned —,www.propublica.org,Jack Gillum,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.propublica.org/article/prosecutors-dropping-child-porn-charges-after-software-tools-are-questioned,"ProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom based in New York.

Using specialized software, investigators traced explicit child pornography to Todd Hartman’s internet address. A dozen police officers raided his Los Angeles-area apartment, seized his computer and arrested him for files including a video of a man ejaculating on a 7-year-old girl. But after his lawyer contended that the software tool inappropriately accessed Hartman’s private files, and asked to examine how it worked, prosecutors dismissed the case.
Near Phoenix, police with a similar detection program tracked underage porn photos, including a 4-year-old with her legs spread, to Tom Tolworthy’s home computer. He was indicted in state court on 10 counts of committing a “dangerous crime against children,” each of which carried a decade in prison if convicted. Yet when investigators checked Tolworthy’s hard drive, the images weren’t there. Even though investigators said different offensive files surfaced on another computer that he owned, the case was tossed.
At a time when at least half a million laptops, tablets, phones and other devices are viewing or sharing child pornography on the internet every month, software that tracks images to specific internet connections has become a vital tool for prosecutors. Increasingly, though, it’s backfiring.
Drawing upon thousands of pages of court filings as well as interviews with lawyers and experts, ProPublica found more than a dozen cases since 2011 that were dismissed either because of challenges to the software’s findings, or the refusal by the government or the maker to share the computer programs with defense attorneys, or both. Tami Loehrs, a forensics expert who often testifies in child pornography cases, said she is aware of more than 60 cases in which the defense strategy has focused on the software.
Defense attorneys have long complained that the government’s secrecy claims may hamstring suspects seeking to prove that the software wrongly identified them. But the growing success of their counterattack is also raising concerns that, by questioning the software used by investigators, some who trade in child pornography can avoid punishment.

“When protecting the defendant’s right to a fair trial requires the government to disclose its confidential techniques, prosecutors face a choice: Give up the prosecution or give up the secret. Each option has a cost,” said Orin Kerr , an expert in computer crime law and former Justice Department lawyer. “If prosecutors give up the prosecution, it may very well mean that a guilty person goes free. If prosecutors give up the secret, it may hurt their ability to catch other criminals. Prosecutors have to choose which of those outcomes is less bad in each particular case.”
In several cases, like Tolworthy’s, court documents say that the software traced offensive images to an Internet Protocol address. But, for reasons that remain unclear, those images weren’t found on the defendant’s computer. In others, like Hartman’s, defense lawyers said the software discovered porn in areas of the computer it wasn’t supposed to enter, and they suggested the police conducted an overly broad search.
These problems are compounded by the insistence of both the government and the software manufacturers on protecting the secrecy of their computer code, so as not to imperil other prosecutions or make trade secrets public. Unwilling to take the risk that the sensitive programs could leak publicly, they have rejected revealing the software even under strict court secrecy.
Nevertheless, the software is facing renewed scrutiny: In another case where child pornography identified by the software wasn’t found on the suspect’s computer, a federal judge in February allowed a defense expert to examine it. And recently, the nonprofit Human Rights Watch asked the Justice Department to review, in part, whether one suite of software tools, the Child Protection System, had been independently tested.
“The sharing of child-sex-abuse images is a serious crime, and law enforcement should be investigating it. But the government needs to understand how the tools work, if they could violate the law and if they are accurate,” said Sarah St.Vincent, a Human Rights Watch researcher who examined the practice.
“These defendants are not very popular, but a dangerous precedent is a dangerous precedent that affects everyone. And if the government drops cases or some charges to avoid scrutiny of the software, that could prevent victims from getting justice consistently,” she said. “The government is effectively asserting sweeping surveillance powers but is then hiding from the courts what the software did and how it worked.”
The dismissals represent a small fraction of the hundreds of federal and state child pornography prosecutions since 2011. More often, defendants plead guilty in exchange for a reduced sentence. (Of 17 closed cases brought since 2017 by the U.S. attorney’s office in Los Angeles, all but two resulted in plea deals, ProPublica found.) Even after their charges were dropped, Tolworthy and Hartman are both facing new trials. Still, the dismissals are noteworthy because challenges to the software are spreading among the defense bar and gaining credence with judges.
Software developers and law enforcement officials say the detection software is an essential part of combating the proliferation of child pornography and exploitation on the internet.
“This is a horrendous crime, and as a society we’re obligated to protect victims this young,” said Brian Levine, a computer science professor at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst who helped develop one such tool, called Torrential Downpour. “There are a number of victims who are too young to speak, or can’t speak out of fear. This tool is available to law enforcement to rescue those children who are abused.”
In cases where previously flagged porn isn’t turning up on a suspect’s computer, investigators have suggested the files have merely been erased before arrest, or that they’re stored in encrypted areas of a hard drive that the police can’t access. Defense attorneys counter that some software logs don’t show the files were ever downloaded in the first place, or that they may have been downloaded by mistake and immediately purged.
Defense lawyers are given a bevy of reasons why porn-detection software can’t be handed over for review, even under a protective order that limits disclosure to attorneys and their experts. Law enforcement authorities often say that they’re prohibited from disclosing software by their contracts with the manufacturer, which considers it proprietary technology.
Prosecutors are also reluctant to disclose a coveted law enforcement tool just to convict one defendant. A Justice Department spokeswoman referred ProPublica to a government journal article, which argued peer-to-peer detection tools “are increasingly targeted by defendants through overbroad discovery requests.”
“While the Department of Justice supports full compliance with all discovery obligations imposed by law,” wrote lawyers for the Justice Department and the FBI, “those obligations generally do not require disclosure of sensitive information regarding law enforcement techniques which, if exposed, would threaten the viability of future investigations.”
One former Justice Department prosecutor said the government has shielded software in criminal cases for fear that disclosure could expose investigators’ capabilities or classified technology to criminals.
“They don’t want to reveal that in a case because it can be the last time they use it,” said the lawyer, who requested anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the topic. “It sounds like they may, in some circumstances, be using programs that are never intended to see the light of day in the criminal justice system.”
The government’s reluctance to share technology with defense attorneys isn’t limited to child pornography cases. Prosecutors have let defendants monitored with cellphone trackers known as Stingrays go free rather than fully reveal the technology. The secrecy surrounding cell tracking was once so pervasive in Baltimore that Maryland’s highest court rebuked the practice as “detrimental.” As was first reported by Reuters in 2013, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration relied in investigations on information gathered through domestic wiretaps, a phone-records database and National Security Agency intercepts, while training agents to hide those sources from the public record.
“Courts and police are increasingly using software to make decisions in the criminal justice system about bail, sentencing, and probability-matching for DNA and other forensic tests,” said Jennifer Granick, a surveillance and cybersecurity lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union’s Speech, Privacy and Technology Project who has studied the issue.
“If the defense isn’t able to examine these techniques, then we have to just take the government’s word for it — on these complicated, sensitive and non-black-and-white decisions. And that’s just too dangerous.”
The software programs used by investigators scan for child porn on peer-to-peer networks, a decentralized connection of computers on the internet where users share files directly with one another. Those networks behave similarly to software like Napster, the popular file-sharing program used to download music in the early days of the commercial internet.
Although Napster may have faded, the trading of child pornography on peer-to-peer networks hasn’t. To keep up, police rely on modified versions of popular peer-to-peer programs to flag IP addresses of suspected child pornography, enabling investigators to subpoena the internet provider and unearth the internet subscriber. They then obtain a search warrant for computers at the physical location they say is involved in sharing porn.
One common suite of software tools, the Child Protection System, is maintained by the Florida-based Child Rescue Coalition . Although the coalition says it’s a nonprofit, it has ties to for-profit data brokers and the data company TLO. (TransUnion, the major credit-reporting agency, has acquired TLO.) CRC has hosted some of its computer servers at TransUnion since 2016, according to a review of internet records collected by the firm Farsight Security.
A redacted user manual filed in a federal case, portions of which were un-redacted by Human Rights Watch and confirmed by ProPublica, indicates that the Child Protection System draws on unverified data gathered by these firms. It says TLO “has allowed law enforcement access to data collected on internet users from a variety of sources,” with enhanced information that includes “marketing data that has been linked to IP addresses and email accounts from corporate sources.”
“No logs are kept of any law enforcement query of corporate data,” the manual continued . It cautioned that subscriber data was unconfirmed, and that it should “be confirmed through other investigative means that are acceptable with your agency and prosecuting attorney.”
Software that relies on unconfirmed information from big data brokers, civil liberties advocates say, may not only point police to the wrong internet address owner, but it also enables them to gather a mountain of personal details about a suspect without a court order, sidestepping constitutional protections.
Read More Machine Bias Investigating Algorithmic Injustice The software’s makers have resisted disclosure of its coding. In May 2013, TLO asked a federal court in El Paso, Texas, to quash a subpoena to reveal the software known as the Child Protection System in a child-porn case. The materials sought, they said, “are protected under the law enforcement privilege and trade secrets laws.” After the judge ordered the software produced, prosecutors instead agreed to a plea deal that favored the defendant; he was sentenced to three years he had already served for “transportation of obscene material.”
CRC says on its website that its software is used in every state and more than 90 countries, and has tracked more than 54 million offenders. CRC President William Wiltse, a former Oregon police officer, has testified for the prosecution in cases in which investigators relied on the Child Protection System.
CRC did not respond to phone and email inquiries from ProPublica this month about its software. It told Human Rights Watch this year, “As a policy, we do not publicly share details of how we identify sex offenders online, as we do not want predators to learn better ways to hide their illegal activity.” A spokesman for TransUnion, which now owns TLO, said the company “supports Child Rescue Coalition in its work with law enforcement to protect children from sexual exploitation online.”
Another widely used detection tool, Torrential Downpour, was developed by the University of Massachusetts a decade ago with U.S. government funding, court records show . Levine told ProPublica in an interview that the program is accurate enough to find probable cause for a search warrant, but that it can only be effective if police and the courts do their jobs.
“The software is one part of an entire process,” Levine said, “followed by investigators and courts to produce reliable evidence and to follow a fair judicial process.”"

Traditional Precedent Rules Do Not Restrain Judicial Activism,www.lawliberty.org,John O. McGinnis,04-02-2019,2019,4,https://www.lawliberty.org/2019/04/02/traditional-precedent-rules-do-not-restrain-judicial-activism/,"by John O. McGinnis | 2 Comments shutterstock.com
Is a strong form of precedent a good way to prevent judicial activism? Many reasonable people seem to think so. I am more skeptical, not least because the relatively strong form of precedent that the Court professes has coexisted with judicial activism for many decades.
But for a deeper analysis, we need to define judicial activism. The most straightforward definition is that the judiciary is activist when it invalidates a provision of the federal or state legislature. We might label this judicial activism type I activism, its opposite being judicial restraint. But another possible definition is that the Court is activist when it acts on its own discretion rather than on the basis of a clear dictate of law. We might label this judicial activism type II activism, its opposite being judicial constraint.
I think a strong form of precedent has a more plausible, if not ultimately persuasive, claim to prevent judicial activism of the second type. The argument would be that the Supreme Court’s thousands of decisions narrow the opportunity for current discretion, because these many decisions of the past provide on point guidance to the controversies of today. But even this claim runs into immediate problems. As Judge Frank Easterbrook has noted, even when the Supreme Court has the same justices precedents will not always be consistent because of paradoxes of voting. And more obviously, given that the Supreme Court changes in composition, precedents over time are even more likely to be inconsistent in their principles, even if not their results. Inconsistent principles then generate the problem of discretion, because justices will need to choose on principle over the other. One might well think that following the original Constitution rather than precedent could well be better on this score, because the relevant provisions were at least formulated at a single time with the greater claim to some principled coherence.
But the problem with precedent as constraint under traditional rules is even more intractable, because some past decisions empower the Court to act in discretionary ways. That is true, of course, of the doctrine of substantive due process at the heart of the line of the Court’s cases on personal autonomy. The Court has in fact resisted calls to overrule the most notorious of these cases, Roe v. Wade , on the grounds of stare decisis. Nor has it reined in the wild chariot that is the substantive due process doctrine generally. It is now a deeply embedded series of precedents.
The difficulty that precedents have in curbing judicial activism of the first type is more straightforward. The Supreme Court has created a lot of precedent that invalidates legislative action as well as upholding it. Roe v. Wade is, of course, again a notorious example of this type of case, and the Supreme Court has repeatedly reaffirmed it on the basis of stare decisis. And most pragmatic rules of stare decisis give weight to the reliance interest of individuals. As a result stare decisis will tend to protect past decisions that protect individual rights rather than those that empower democratic legislatures. Precedent rules are not neutral between judicial activism and judicial restraint.
Now, of course, it could be argued that judicial activism of type I should be defined to include only cases that strike down legislation wrongly . But many, if not most scholars, have argued that such a definition drains judicial activism of any independent meaning, equating the concept instead with judicial correctness. But however that dispute is resolved as a general matter, this narrower definition of judicial activism does not seem a useful concept in the context of precedent. The whole point of treating a decision as precedent is not to revisit the correctness of the decision.
In a subsequent post, I will consider whether it is possible to revise the rules of precedent so that they would be more effective against judicial activism, even if my own view is that judicial constraint or restraint per se should not be the primary goal for precedent rules. John O. McGinnis

Meretz leader Tamar Zandberg rejected accusations that she has not succeeded in maintaining the party's past support among young voters and has lost them to former Likud MK Moshe Feiglin's Zehut Party, on Wednesday at a Hebrew language conference in Tel Aviv that was sponsored by The Jerusalem Post Group, parent company of the Maariv newspaper and the Post .In her answers to questions from Maariv columnists, Zandberg cited polls indicating that Feiglin's votes come from right-wing parties and not Meretz.

""The only issue we have in common is legalization of cannabis, in which as usual, Meretz was the pioneering party.""Zandberg said the April 9 election is fateful and will be decided by small parties. ""The fate of the Center-Left bloc will be decided by the fate of Meretz,"" she said. ""Without Meretz, [Blue and White leader Benny] Gantz won’t have a government. Zandberg said Meretz would not have trouble crossing the 3.25% electoral threshold, which is expected to be about 140,000 votes.

By JERUSALEM POST STAFF A sign on a Jerusalem bus proclaims, ‘The Likud is strength.’. (photo credit: ERICA SCHACHNE)
The chairman of the Elections Committee, Supreme Court Justice Hanan Melcer, announced a criminal investigation against the Likud party to determine if its Move to the Right campaign broke any election laws. The ruling party of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu faces fines for the campaign that seeks to drum up support for not just their own party but other right-wing parties.According to a report published by Maariv , the decision came after a petition by the left-wing Labor Party and Attorney Shahar Ben-Meir, who alleged that the Likud headquarters is being used to finance and run Move to the Right, which has published online videos and other material urging voters to vote for any of the parties considered right-wing, including Likud, the New Right, the Union of Right-Wing Parties and others. Move to the Right, called ""Zazim Yemina"" in Hebrew is led by senior Likud activist Mordechai Benita, who argued Tuesday that all the activities and funding taking place at Likud headquarters were part of the Likud election campaign and broke no laws, Maariv explained.The findings of the investigation will be presented within three months to the Attorney General and the State Comptroller, well after the April 9th elections in which Likud is neck-and-neck in the polls with the Blue and White party headed by Benny Gantz and Yair Lapid. Overnight, the Likud said intends to appeal to Melcer and request that he reconsider his decision and allow the party to present him with new data that was not presented to him prior to the formulation of his decision to investigate.Earlier on Tuesday, Attorney-General Avichai Mandelblit demanded Likud identify itself as being behind any campaigns, social media or otherwise, that it is connected to or funding. He was responding to a Blue and White Party request to block a campaign and penalize the Likud. The party later revealed its connection. Move to the Right published a Facebook post blasting the investigation stating, ""Attorney Shachar Ben-Meir, tell us what are you afraid of?"" It claimed Move to the Right is different from the V15 group that promoted left-wing parties in the 2015 elections and led to the creation of a special law reforming election campaigns. תיראו מופתעים: השמאל עתר נגדנו אבל אל דאגה: זה לא ישבור אותנו עו""ד שחר בן מאיר, ספר לנו ממה אתה פוחד? כמי שעתר נגד מתן...

[EUobserved] 'Non-partisan' Timmermans campaigns for EU in Leiden,euobserver.com,,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://euobserver.com/eu-election/144576,"Dutch students Wieke Reekers and Gina van Wingerde were not even sure what political party Frans Timmermans belonged to.
""We just looked it up: Labour,"" Van Wingerde told EUobserver on Tuesday (2 April) in the Dutch city of Leiden, where the European Commission's second-in-command had just finished a 90-minute Q&A session.
Timmermans appeared as first vice-president of the European Commission, and managed to steer clear of party politics (Photo: Peter Teffer) The centre-left Timmermans was here as part of the commission's 'citizen dialogues' , aimed at bridging the often-cited gap between ordinary Europeans and the EU.
It was the 1,500th such event in Europe, according to the moderator.
Timmermans was there as the first vice-president of the commission. However, Timmermans is also the Party of European Socialist's (PES) lead candidate to become commission president, succeeding his boss Jean-Claude Juncker.
He is also on Labour's list to become an MEP at the May elections.
New rules Under Juncker's leadership, the rules were changed to allow campaigning for an EU post while in office as a commissioner - as opposed to commissioners campaigning for a national domestic post, who have to take a leave of absence.
The new rules raise questions about the blurring of lines of a commissioner acting in the common interest of the EU and the commission, and a commissioner campaigning on behalf of his or her political party.
At the event in Leiden, the Dutch politician succeeded in remaining non-partisan.
Not once did he mention his centre-left Labour party, the word 'Spitzenkandidat' or his European political family.
A feat of restraint, considering the event took place less than eight weeks before the European Parliament elections .
But at the same time, Timmermans, a former minister of foreign affairs , did offer a distinctive view of European integration.
""I would have been surprised to find out if he had been a member of a right-wing party,"" admitted Van Wingerde.
Another student, Thom van Leuveren, also said he heard a ""left-wing vision"" on Europe, but saw Timmermans more as a ""European politician"" than as a member of centre-left Labour.
""I thought that he was not explicitly campaigning, but he was there as a vice-president,"" he said.
While he operated in a non-partisan way, in line with the commission code of conduct, he was definitely not neutral.
Timmermans spoke as a representative of the pro-EU mainstream, which wants to deepen EU integration, rather than as a candidate of a specific party.
That may backfire, as anti-EU parties can argue that the centrist mainstream parties are all the same.
Of course, Timmermans was asked to give his opinion of the most recent local election vote in the Netherlands, which saw success for one of those anti-EU parties.
The Timmermans event took place less than two weeks after provincial elections were won by a three-year-old right-wing anti-EU party called Forum for Democracy.
The provincial vote will shape the distribution of seats in the parliament's upper house, the senate, next month.
The Forum victory happened in an increasingly fragmented political landscape, in which becoming the largest party is less impressive than when only two or three mainstream parties divided more than half of the votes, a few decades ago.
Many of his voters switched from that other anti-EU party, Geert Wilders' Party for Freedom.
But it was still a shock to many that the party came out as the largest with 13 of 75 seats - ahead of prime minister Mark Rutte's liberals' 12 seats.
In Timmermans' analysis, there is an increasingly realisation among Europeans that they are interdependent, and that this leads to two different reactions, depending on people's general attitude to life.
""People with an optimistic nature say: hey, we depend on each other, so let's get to work together. People who are pessimistic see that dependency as a threat, and want to get rid of that dependency,"" he said.
He warned that you can't turn pessimists into optimists within a few weeks, but also stressed that the appeal to a Dutch exit from the EU, or 'Nexit', seemed to have weakened after the UK referendum vote to leave.
Brexit 'tears' The chaos which followed in British politics ""brought tears to my eyes"", said Timmermans.
He noted that the official line of both Forum for Democracy and Wilders' party is still to pursue Nexit.
""But Brexit has had a deterring effect on many people,"" said Timmermans.
""Otherwise Wilders would still be shouting for a Nexit, and he hasn't done that for a long time. That is purely because of Brexit,"" he added.
Timmermans ended his Q&A session, which allowed for a dozen or so questions from the audience, with an appeal to go out and vote.
""Make a choice,"" he said.
""Make a choice for the left, make a choice for the right, make a choice for the centre. Never become indifferent,"" he noted.
Implicit was the warning that those that want to break up the EU are not indifferent, and will do so if given the chance.
The event was opened with a speech by Leiden mayor Henri Lenferink, a fellow Labour member.
Lenferink noted how ""Europe-minded"" Leiden is, and referred to the 2016 referendum on the EU-Ukraine association treaty, which was rejected .
Leiden was one of two municipalities in the province where a majority voted in favour of the Ukraine treaty.
Thus, it was not only because the event took place in a 17th century protestant church, that Timmermans was preaching to the converted.

Progressives in Springfield Co-sponsor Misguided Resolution,illinoisfamily.org,David E Smith,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://illinoisfamily.org/politics/junior-commies-in-springfield-co-sponsor-misguided-resolution/,"PRINT
Last week ten lawmakers from the Jewish Caucus in Springfield sponsored a resolution condemning Illinois Family Action (IFA) and Illinois Family Institute (IFI) for engaging in what they call “hate speech,” because IFA compared the abortion holocaust to the Jewish Holocaust. Titled “ Illinois Family Action-Hate Speech ” (HJR 55), the resolution uses subjective hyperbole, disreputable sources and unreasonable inferences that make the alleged offense seem overtly sinister.
If you want an exhaustive, well-argued refutation of the resolution, read “ Left-Wing Partisans File Stunning Resolution Against Illinois Family .” HJR 55 is stunning for all the reasons that author Laurie Higgins identifies but also because of its glaring omission: any mention of abortion, the topic of the article that started it all.
There are always hazards when invoking the Holocaust, not least of which is overstating the parallel to a current situation. But that’s not the case here. It is indisputable that the Nazis dehumanized an entire class of human beings defined solely by their ethnoreligious heritage, then rounded them up and shipped them off to be exterminated with lethal efficiency in death camps across Europe.
It’s also indisputable that abortion providers—most notably Planned Parenthood—are also in the extermination business. They and their enablers—most notably regressive Democrats, who increasingly champion infanticide—have dehumanized an entire class of human beings defined solely by their stage of development in situ .
One significant difference between the Jewish Holocaust and our modern holocaust is that abortion clinics don’t have to round up babies and send them to a centralized abortion mill. Instead, Planned Parenthood has conveniently dotted the country with more than 600 of their own little death camps for easy access. It’s the children’s own mothers who—whether they gleefully “shout their abortion” or enter a clinic in desperation—play the role of Hitler’s Schutzstaffel .
The parallels between the two holocausts, made so often as to be in danger of becoming cliché, are strong and obvious—except to the willfully blind.
So why the extraordinary step of a resolution in the Illinois House condemning the comparison? Just this: by making the comparison, Illinois Family conferred personhood on the pro-choicers’ blob of tissue. IFI re -humanized them. The resolution’s assertion that IFI is “recklessly comparing those who disagree with their extreme agenda to Nazis” can only be true if babies aren’t human.
The resolution is a naked halogen bulb blinding observers to their real objective, which is to intimidate and shame IFI into submission. Accusations of unspecified threats, anti-Semitism, “hate speech,” “bigotry,” “homophobia” and “extreme rhetoric” are followed by a call for “a formal investigation” into such speech and asking the Secretary of State to suspend IFI’s lobbying credentials.
One of the resolution’s co-sponsors, State Representative Jonathan Carroll (D-Northbrook), took to Twitter to express his outrage . “This is hate speech and I demand a retraction. Comparing Democrats to Nazis to to [ sic ] promote your agenda is disgraceful.” He was later quoted as saying, “We call on the Illinois State Police to do a full investigation of these incidents.”
To summarize: the all-Democrat Jewish Caucus of the Illinois House of Representatives has circled the wagons and called for reinforcements because they don’t like a commonly-used analogy comparing the killing of 61,000,000 babies (and counting) to the killing of 6,000,000 Jews—and allegedly fear that they will now be the victims of violence. To address the threat, they are summoning the power of the state to crush IFI.
How very Hitler-esque.
Meanwhile, the State of Illinois is circling the drain. We are the least fiscally solvent state, but pay the highest state and local taxes in the country ; we are the third most corrupt state in the nation and boast the worst-in-nation pension crisis ; we’re unlikely to successfully weather a recession , we have one of the worst home foreclosure rates in the nation, and we lead the country in number of residents fleeing the state .
If regressives get their way, they’ll also bestow on Illinois the distinction of having the most radical abortion laws in the land. (We’re number one! We’re number one!)
Instead of wasting their time and taxpayer money weaponizing the state to kick around a tiny pro-family organization that enjoys First Amendment protections, how about getting busy fixing the national embarrassment that the land of Lincoln has become?
Instead of indoctrinating five freshman legislators on the finer points of virtue signaling (“ Hate has no home here ,” right, Rep. Sara Feigenholtz ?), how about challenging Jonathan Carroll, Daniel Didech , Jennifer Gong-Gershowitz , Yehiel Kalish , Karina Villa , Anna Moeller and Bob Morgan to balance a budget by reining in spending? Instead of demonstrating knee jerk outrage, how about demanding an investigation into how the most corrupt big city in the nation let Jussie “O.J.” Smollett skate after slandering half the country’s citizens and lying about it?
Regressives and their junior commies in the Illinois House have more pressing issues to deal with than some petty disagreement about whether legal abortion is like the Jewish Holocaust or not. Judging by the March 20 turnout to protest the proposed abortion legislation that “overtaxed Capitol security,” there are a lot of people who agree that it is.
The Hebrew prophet Isaiah wrote, “Woe to those who call good evil and evil good, who put darkness for light and light for darkness, who put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter” (Isaiah 5:20). Jewish legislators should understand better than anyone the evil of taking innocent life. Rescind the resolution and do what you were elected to do: rescue Illinois.
Take ACTION: Click HERE to contact your state senator and representative to ask them to reject this dangerous resolution. Ask them to vote down HJR 55 and the unprecedented and tyrannical action being taken by extreme partisans in the Illinois General Assembly.

We must stop the next great Latin American crisis before it's too late,thehill.com,,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://thehill.com/opinion/international/436705-we-must-stop-the-next-latin-american-crisis-before-its-too-late,"We must stop the next great Latin American crisis before it's too late By Jason Marczak, opinion contributor — 04/01/19 01:00 PM EDT The views expressed by contributors are their own and not the view of The Hill View Latest Opinions >> For a brief moment last year, the world’s eyes were fixated on an unlikely target: Nicaragua. After unleashing a brutal crackdown on anti-government protests, Daniel Ortega’s regime received sharp-tongued condemnation from all corners. But it wasn’t long before the international community’s focus shifted to the next crisis du jour. The latest developments in the country, however, are making it clear: It’s time to start paying attention to Nicaragua again. And Venezuela shows us exactly why. ADVERTISEMENT Over the last year, hundreds of activists, protesters and opposition members have been arrested in the Central American nation. The U.N.’s Human Rights office has denounced the use of arbitrary arrests and long pretrial detentions as a way for the government to muffle dissent en masse through unrestrained imprisonment. While hundreds are detained without trial, those who actually have faced trial have met an even worse fate. Community activists and organizers have been handed draconian prison sentences under charges of terrorism. Throughout it all, Ortega, a former freedom-fighter-turned-authoritarian, has clamped down to consolidate his authority — slowly over the past years and rapidly over the past months. Now effectively controlling all levers of power, Ortega is able to use non-government institutions as tools for his crackdown on dissent. Universities in the country have expelled over 100 students to date for participating in protests and in some cases for simply posting critical comments on social media. Under state coercion, universities have even turned students over to the police to face charges. Meanwhile, press freedoms have been eroded with little attention from the world at a time when our collective focus is rightly on attacks on the press. Independent media outlets have been ransacked and shut down, reporters have been imprisoned, and over 50 journalists have gone into self-exile just in the past three months. This, of course, is all painfully reminiscent of the past few years in Venezuela. Ortega has been following the authoritarian playbook step by step. What we’re witnessing is the transition period to dictatorship. And now, the crisis is entering a new phase — one that may seem promising to anyone just tuning in but will give pause to those who have been watching Latin America for years. Last year, Ortega agreed to enter into “national dialogue” with the opposition. The talks quickly broke down, however, as the government’s intransigence became clear and Ortega’s security forces oversaw a concurrent violent crackdown on demonstrations in which over 300 people were killed. Now, Ortega and the Alianza Civica opposition coalition have agreed to a restart of negotiations with a dubious promise by the Nicaraguan leader to release all 700-plus political prisoners within 90 days. For Venezuela-watchers, it’s enough to spark an acute case of déjà vu. Venezuela’s current crisis is not new, and neither are the attempts to end it. The country saw negotiations between government and opposition begin in 2016. Those talks, similarly, broke down over a lack of concessions by the government and restarted several times at Maduro’s disingenuous behest. Throughout it all, Maduro was able to use the guise of “dialogue” as a mechanism for remaining in office, all the while consolidating his power and ramping up repression. It’s a sad, years-long tragedy that has played out before our eyes and has culminated in the crisis we see today. Accordingly, many in Nicaragua are worried that Ortega is now using the same strategy as a way to buy time and further strengthen his rule. But it doesn’t have to go that way. These negotiations could truly present a way out of Nicaragua’s crisis. But for that to happen, the international community needs to pay attention and exert concerted pressure. Especially now, as our eyes are belatedly turned toward Venezuela, Ortega is counting on our attention being diverted from him. We can’t give him that gift. We have a chance here to stop another Venezuela before it happens. To do that, the international community must make clear that it is a dedicated stakeholder in this process, in the same way it is now doing in Venezuela. The U.S., along with the Lima Group of Latin American democracies and the EU, should take an active role in supporting the Nicaraguan people’s demands: early, internationally-monitored elections, the release of all political prisoners and a credible process to bring justice to those whose loved ones have been killed or disappeared for the crime of voicing dissent. As negotiations recommence, it must be made clear to Ortega that this time the world is watching and that Maduro’s old strategy won’t be replicable. If that doesn’t happen, we already have a blueprint for what will come next in Nicaragua. The country has already seen massive uptick in emigration in the last year. The U.N. reports that nearly 23,000 Nicaraguans sought asylum in Costa Rica from April to November alone. But what seems today like a massive uptick may seem tomorrow like the slow trickle before the dams burst. Venezuela’s spiraling refugee crisis provides a stark warning. In its own restive neighborhood, Nicaragua has long stood apart from the Northern Triangle countries of Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala. ADVERTISEMENT A Northern Triangle task force convened by the Atlantic Council found that over 10 percent of these three countries’ populations have fled, citing a breakdown of the rule of law leading to pervasive violence and destitution. If Ortega is allowed to succeed in following Maduro’s playbook, Nicaragua is all but certain to proceed down a similar path. It might not be long, in that case, before Latin America sees another full-fledged migrant crisis. In Nicaragua, we have an opportunity to peacefully prevent another Venezuela before it becomes too late. And to be sure, if it were not for the calamity in Caracas, all eyes right now would be squarely on Managua. But we can’t afford tunnel vision at a time like this. If the international community takes decisive steps to let Ortega know its eyes are on him, too, Nicaragua may well see a negotiated, diplomatic path out of this crisis. If not, it will be just a matter of time before déjà vu strikes again. Jason Marczak is the director of the Atlantic Council’s Adrienne Arsht Latin America Center . He is on Twitter at @JMarczak ."

With Chile on track to have more than 21 percent of its territory under some type of protection, the next decade offers a crucial opportunity to develop effective conservation measures that guarantee the appropriate and long-term stewardship of these areas. Yet new threats keep emerging, and several key challenges remain. Management of national parks must be strengthened, additional funding must be allocated, and more personnel are needed.
Today, Chilean Patagonia in particular has only 113 full-time staff members dedicated to its parks. Each ranger in the Aysén and Magallanes regions, for example, looks after an average of 63,800 hectares (246 square miles)—an area the size of Singapore.
Notable for its glaciers, forests, and archipelagos that span more than 46 million hectares (177,600 square miles)—comparable to the size of New Zealand—Chilean Patagonia is a special place that needs protection. Its endemic species, its pristine environment, and the interconnectivity of land and sea, with 40 percent of the area composed of islands, make it a region of exceptional ecological value.
Unlike the drier Argentine Pampas on the east side of Patagonia, the humid and wet climate on the Chilean side in the west creates one of the few cold sub-Antarctic jungles in the world—a lush forest of ñirres, coigües, lengas, and other native trees that extends to the edge of South America, where a rugged coastline gives way to more than 40,000 islands.
But mining, hydroelectric dams, salmon farming, and other extractive activities pose potential threats to the region and its rich biodiversity. Important progress
Chile has made great strides in land and sea protections in recent years. In March 2017, then-President Michelle Bachelet and conservation philanthropist Kristine McDivitt Tompkins signed an agreement to expand Chile’s national system of protected areas by 1.35 million hectares (5,200 square miles).
Under the accord, 407,000 hectares (1,570 square miles) of Patagonia, acquired by the Tompkins family and managed until then as a private park that was open to the public, were donated to the Chilean government. In exchange, the government earmarked almost 1 million hectares (3,860 square miles) of public land for conservation, all for the creation of new national parks or the expansion of existing parks.
And in January 2018, Chile established the Parks Network, bringing the total amount of protected areas in Chilean Patagonia to 13,515,608 hectares (52,184 square miles). Pew in Chile
In the next decade, long-term maintenance of the world-renowned Patagonia regional ecosystem, and the communities within it, is a conservation and economic development priority. This is a major focus for The Pew Charitable Trusts, which is working with other nonprofit organizations, universities, local officials, and community residents to bolster the protection of this area for the good of Chileans and the environment.
Pew and its partners in Patagonia work to: Strengthen the management of existing parks to help them meet international conservation standards. Establish a robust system for protecting marine-coastal ecosystems. Create new protected areas and/or agree to conservation measures on public lands and with private landowners. Increase funding for protected areas and encourage sustainable development in gateway communities.
To achieve these goals, Pew focuses its efforts on three key areas: science, partnerships, and public policy.
Science: To have a scientific basis to support its conservation work in Patagonia, Pew partnered with the Universidad Austral de Chile to develop scientific proposals for the creation and management of protected areas and to map currently protected public lands and other areas of high conservation value.
Partnerships: Pew values strong alliances with organizations that share the goal of improving the protection of natural areas in southern Chile. For the Chilean Patagonia conservation project, diverse entities came together to create the Patagonia Mary Tierra working group, a consortium of nine nonprofit organizations, including Pew, that aims to conserve Chilean Patagonia’s land and marine ecosystems for the public good.
Public policy: As a nonpartisan, nongovernmental global research and public policy organization, Pew is dedicated to serving the public. Our mission is to: Improve public policy by conducting rigorous analysis, linking diverse interests to pursue common cause, and insisting on tangible results; Inform the public by providing useful data that illuminate the issues and trends shaping our world; and Invigorate civic life by encouraging democratic participation and strong communities.
In Chile, Pew partners with other organizations to provide research and the recommendations of experts in land and marine conservation.
The coming years are a crucial time for Pew, its partners, and the community to work together to ensure that Chilean Patagonia’s national parks get the resources they need, while continuing to support the creation and effective management of additional protected areas in Chile."

Tory Brexiteers have forgotten something very important about the 2017 election,leftfootforward.org,Josiah Mortimer,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://leftfootforward.org/2019/04/brexiteers-have-forgotten-something-very-important-about-the-2017-election/,"Brexit & Foreign Policy Left Foot Forward The PM is working with Labour because she has to.
Despite projecting the image of being devout defenders of the British constitution, hard Brexiteers seem to have forgotten a few crucial facts.
The European Research Group responded with rage to the PM’s offer to meet with Jeremy Corbyn on Tuesday.
“People did not vote for a Corbyn-May coalition government – they voted for a Conservative government, which became a confidence and supply with the DUP,” said Jacob Rees-Mogg.
Tory MP Conor Burns was devastated that the PM was working with Labour:
“The UK no longer has a functioning government of executive control. The PM has handed the future decisions over Brexit to the Labour party. It will now be for Corbyn, Diane Abbott and John McDonnell to decide if the Conservative party implements its manifesto. It is a very bleak day.”
Both statements betray some fairly brazen inconsistencies.
Firstly, people didn’t ‘vote for a Conservative government’. Under Parliamentary democracy, people vote for 650 MPs, who then give ‘confidence’ to the formation of a government. The Tories rely on the DUP to prop them up. And if you can no longer count on your confidence-and-supply partner, you have to look elsewhere.
Taking a step back: the Conservatives got 42% of the vote in 2017. Labour weren’t far behind with 40% of the vote.
The DUP – which has dominated the debate and is greatly over-represented under First Past the Post – secured 0.9% of the vote. On less than 300,000 votes, they have dominated the Brexit debate – while the SNP with around 900,000 votes have been ignored and sidelined.
Nor did voters elect a Tory majority. Famously, the party lost seats and failed to get over the line.
You can argue the Tories have the largest mandate – but the public did not give the party a monopoly to ride over their concerns about jobs, workers’ rights and the environment.
As one person pointed out , it’s funny how quick the Tory right are to switch their focus when peddling their “80% of voters supported for Brexit-backing parties in 2017” line – but refuse to countenance talking to a party that makes up half of that vote share. (Brexiteer David Davis is among those who’ve trumpeted such claims.)
Burns’ statement that “It will now be for Corbyn, Diane Abbott and John McDonnell to decide if the Conservative party implements its manifesto” also misses the point.
You don’t get a right to unilaterally impose your manifesto if you didn’t win a majority. By definition, May is working with Corbyn because she has to. The two parties did secure over 80% of the vote in 2017, after all.
But then again, perhaps none of the ERG’s constitutional confusion is surprising when you consider that Jacob Rees-Mogg recently called for Parliament to be shut down to force through Brexit. Or that Tory MPs apparently obsessed with ‘Parliamentary sovereignty’ appear to have discarded Burke in viewing the 2016 referendum as an ‘Order’ to MPs. That view – expressed by the ERG’s Mark Francois this week – effectively turns MPs into drones rather than representatives with their own minds.
Looks like hard Brexiteers only really support Parliamentary democracy when it suits .

 One Response to “Tory Brexiteers have forgotten something very important about the 2017 election” Patrick Newman Yesterday
The two statements from Brexiteer M.P.’s are just juvenile hyperbole! May’s pathological instinct is to simply re-cycle her deal with Corbyn being fed a few concessionary ‘bones’ – amending the PD to include worthy statements about workers rights, environmental and consumer standards. The purpose to validate a fourth attempt at putting her deal to Parliament getting around the Speakers rule on repeating motions that are unchanged in substance. The Tory Party is not structured to deliver any deal on Brexit and the majority view in the sticks appears to be a no deal Brexit. Brexit will split the Tory Party and this may be complemented by Labour desertions. Corbyn needs to be aware of the dangers in what may become a blame game. If he has any sense he will insist on a cross-party role in the post Brexit negotiations, better still a summer general election. It’s a Tory monumental Brexit cock-up but they still ‘support’ a lame duck Prime Minister to front the negotiations – you could not make it up! Leave a Reply"

"After Mosque Shootings, A Rebranding Debate Over Christchurch's Rugby Crusaders",wcqs.org,Francesca Paris,04-03-2019,2019,4,http://wcqs.org/post/after-mosque-shootings-rebranding-debate-over-christchurchs-rugby-crusaders,"After Mosque Shootings, A Rebranding Debate Over Christchurch's Rugby Crusaders By Francesca Paris • 7 hours ago Pictured here in 2018, the Crusader horseman ride around the arena prior to the start of a Super Rugby semifinal match. The Crusaders announced Wednesday that they will be considering a change to their name and branding following the Christchurch attacks on March 15. Mark Baker / AP
The Crusaders rugby team will consider dropping its imagery of sword-bearing knights on horseback and changing its name, following last month's shootings at two mosques in Christchurch that killed 50 people.
The current branding of the Christchurch-based team is ""no longer tenable"" because of associations with religious war, New Zealand Rugby's chief executive, Steve Tew, said in a statement released on Wednesday . He said ""maintaining the status quo"" of the name and imagery was not under consideration.
Tew said it was clear that the Super Rugby franchise's symbolism was ""offensive to some in the community due to its association with the religious Crusades between Christians and Muslims."" The team says it will decide the extent of the rebranding — whether to overturn its brand completely or retire its imaging but keep the name — in consultation with an independent research company.
The team will also halt its traditional pre-match entertainment of knights riding horses, The Associated Press reports .
Calls for Super Rugby's top franchise to consider changing its symbols have come from fans, community members, commentators and lawmakers in the weeks following the March 15 terroristattacks that left dozens wounded and shocked the country.
The team, along with others, opted to cancel a highly-anticipated match that was scheduled for the following day out of respect for the victims. On the heels of the cancellation, Crusaders CEO Colin Mansbridge said the franchise would delay considering any branding changes until ""an appropriate time.""
Several days after the shooting, the team was already undertaking discussions with the Muslim community in Christchurch, according to Grant Robertson, New Zealand's minister for sport and recreation.
""I think that's appropriate, clearly this is a big issue in Canterbury,"" he was quoted as saying by New Zealand newspaper Stuff on March 19. ""The Crusaders is a well-established name and brand, but I think it's a responsible action to undertake those conversations now.""
Some New Zealanders have expressed resistance to the change, in part because of how established the franchise is.
On Wednesday, Mansbridge reiterated the defense of the brand that he had originally put forward just days after the shooting. ""Our challenge is that the name Crusader has come to mean something quite different to many of the team's supporters,"" he said. ""This team is proud of the positive contribution it makes to the community.""
Mansbridge said ""tragic and trying events"" had molded the team into a galvanizing force for the region, making the name ""more reflective of a positive Crusade."" Those sentiments were echoed online and in New Zealand media, with one radio DJ arguing the team played an important role for the Christchurch community following the 2011 earthquake that killed 185 people.
Other people took issue with Tew's statement that an association with the religious Crusades ""has now been drawn.""
""The link has not been 'drawn'...it has been actively promoted for years,"" tweeted Liam Dann, New Zealand Herald Business Editor-at-Large.
The Crusades were a series of religious wars between Christians and Muslims over territorial control of holy sites in the medieval period.
According to the team, the Crusaders brand was modeled off ""a stylised version of medieval England, in a nod to the English heritage of Christchurch,"" when the Super Rugby competition began in 1996. The team's website describes the horsemen logo, recognizable ""Conquest of Paradise"" theme song and center-piece sword as ""pieces of the Crusaders jigsaw have made the Crusaders concept widely recognised and so intimidating for visiting teams.""
The franchise's name and wardrobe will remain the same through the end of the 2019 season. The team has invited the public to offer feedback about the branding. Copyright 2019 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org. © 2019 BPR"

To see more, visit https://www.npr.org.
ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:
A Chinese woman carrying a thumb drive full of malware was arrested this weekend for lying her way into Mar-a-Lago, the president's private club in Palm Beach, Fla. The president was golfing at a nearby property at the time, though he and his family were staying at Mar-a-Lago last weekend. The Miami Herald has the story. Reporter Nicholas Nehamas joins us now. Welcome.
NICHOLAS NEHAMAS: Glad to be here.
SHAPIRO: We don't know much about this woman. What can you tell us about her?
NEHAMAS: Well, we know her name was Yujing Zhang. She came to Mar-a-Lago for an event with a group called the United Nations Friendship Association. And she was carrying Taiwanese passports. Beyond that, we don't really know who she is.
SHAPIRO: She was also carrying a lot of electronics. What did they find on her?
NEHAMAS: Yeah. She had four cellphones, one laptop, one external hard drive and one thumb drive that contained malware according to the U.S. Secret Service. But beyond that, we don't know much about what kind of malware it was, whether her device had been unintentionally infected with it or whether she had loaded that malware onto the thumb drive herself.
SHAPIRO: So the charges that she faces include making false statements to a federal officer and entering restricted property. Can you give us the play-by-play as best we understand it?
NEHAMAS: Yeah, so she came to Mar-a-Lago, the president's private club, and said she wanted to use the pool and kind of implied that she was the relative of a member of Mar-a-Lago with a similar or the same surname and kind of got into the reception area that way. But then it turned out she wasn't on any list, and then her story changed, that she was here for this U.N. event, something which had been advertised by Cindy Yang. And that's when the Secret Service detained her.
SHAPIRO: OK, I want to dig a little deeper into this woman Cindy Yang - her real name is Li Yang - who has been in the news before in connection with a massage parlor that was at the center of a prostitution bust. She's also accused of selling access to the Trump family. How does this woman factor into the story?
NEHAMAS: So Ms. Yang, who, you know, as you said, owned the massage parlor where Robert Kraft was arrested, charged with soliciting prostitution, had a side business where she sold access to the president and his family, to events at Mar-a-Lago to Chinese business executives. And she had advertised an event set to take place at Mar-a-Lago on that day. It had been canceled after a lot of news reporting on her activities. So the woman who showed up to the club on Saturday said she was there for an event that had been canceled.
SHAPIRO: And Democrats have called for a counterintelligence investigation into Yang. That was before this latest story broke about the woman being busted with malware on a thumb drive. So how does that relate to this?
NEHAMAS: Yes, that's right. There are concerns by national security experts that Ms. Yang has ties to groups in the U.S. that are projections of the Chinese Communist Party's goals abroad. And so the Democrats are asking for an examination of how closely tied is she, if at all, to China's government and its efforts abroad.
SHAPIRO: I've heard people say ever since President Trump was elected that Mar-a-Lago presents a security threat. On the other hand, this woman was caught and arrested. So do you think this shows the weakness of Mar-a-Lago or the strength of the security perimeter that's there?
NEHAMAS: Well, you know, I don't think we quite know enough about what the situation was. You know, was it a harmless, confused tourist? Was it something more sinister? But certainly it is true that she was stopped well before she got into the club. And the president was golfing not at Mar-a-Lago but at his nearby golf course. So he was not present when this happened.
SHAPIRO: I know a lot of the details that you're sharing with us come from public court documents. Is there a court appearance scheduled for the woman at the center of this?
NEHAMAS: Yes, she has a detention hearing April 8 and an arraignment April 15. So I hope we will know more.
SHAPIRO: Nicholas Nehamas of the Miami Herald, thanks a lot.
NEHAMAS: Thanks for having me. Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR. © 2019 BPR"
