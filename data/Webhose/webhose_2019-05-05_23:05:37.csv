No, you want a brand new 2019 natural gas pipeline with real time monitoring. They can build you one in a few months and it's good for around 50 years or so, then you replace it with another brand new one.
No spilled fuel oil. No dirty particulate matter in your air. No greasy slime on your windows and furniture from the air.
Going to save you poor east coast socialists a pile of cash, and it's better for the environment too if you're worried about your CO2 footprint. That's why our emissions are going down, at a time when the economy is growing. We're using natural gas -- it's a waste product from fracking too."
