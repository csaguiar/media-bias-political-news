AG BARR “DISGUSTED” BY WHAT HE’S DISCOVERED (SO-FAR). “IN ALL MY YEARS, IN ALL MY LIFE, I NEVER WOULD HAVE THOUGHT [ ] BE POSSIBLE WITHIN THE HALLS OF THESE PRESTIGIOUS FEDERAL AGENCIES.” PRESS CONF COMING? THEY WILL CLAIM POLITICAL ATTACK. Q Rep. Louie Gohmert LIT UP Judiciary Chairman Nadler on Wednesday over the Democrat attempt to release the full Mueller Report. Democrats are still searching for the elusive Holy Grail of Trump collusion with Russia. They are looking in the wrong direction. More American voters today believe Crooked Hillary colluded with foreign operatives than Trump did. Louie Gohmert popped their collusion balloon on Wednesday Take a listen to what he said
[embedded content] More Voters Think Hillary Clinton “Illegally Colluded With Foreign Operatives” Than Trump: Poll Now that the Mueller report is out, a new nationwide poll of voters reveals that more people believe Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign “illegally colluded with foreign operatives” than Trump’s, according Rasmussen .
47% of Likely U.S. Voters think Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign is more likely than President Trump’s to have illegally colluded with foreign operatives. Nearly as many (45%) still suspect the Trump campaign more. – Rasmussen Let’s review the Clinton campaign’s ties to Russia (and imagine if this were Trump’s team): Individuals connected to the Uranium One deal, in which Russia purchased the rights to mine 20% of American uranium, reportedly donated $145 million to the Clinton foundation before the deal was approved while Clinton was Secretary of State. Bill Clinton picked up a cool $500,000 for one Moscow speech. During the same trip he hung out with Russian President Vladimir Putin at his house . Hillary Clinton’s Chief of Staff, John Podesta (who would have likely become her Secretary of State), sat on the board of Massachusetts energy company Joule Unlimited, along with senior Russian official Anatoly Chubais and Russian oligarch Ruben Vardanyan – who was appointed by Vladimir Putin to the Russian economic council. Two months after Podesta joined the board, Joule managed to raise $35 million from Putin’s Kremlin-backed investment fund Rusnano. Not only did John Podesta fail to properly disclose this relationship before joining the Clinton Campaign, he transferred 75,000 shares of Joule to his daughter through a shell company using her address . John Podesta’s brother, Tony, received $180,000 to lobby for Uranium One during the same period that the Clinton Foundation was receiving millions from U1 interests, and after Russia took majority ownership in the “20 percent” deal ( source – you have to add up the years). Tony Last but not least, the infamous “Steele Dossier” that Clinton’s campaign paid for relied on Kremlin officials . Hillary Clinton – through Steele and other intermediaries – was working with Russians against Donald Trump .

Donald Trump Dismisses Democrat Demand for Six Years of Tax Returns President Donald Trump dismissed the news that House Democrats asked the Internal Revenue Service for six years of tax returns on Wednesday. “Is that all? Oh. Usually, it’s ten so I guess they’re giving up,” Trump replied when asked about the news by reporters at the White House. Trump said “We are under audit, despite what people said, and we’re working that out, I’m always under audit, it seems, but I’ve been under audit for many years because the numbers are big, and I guess when you have a name, you’re audited,” he said.

Another database, from an app called At the Pool, listed names, passwords and email addresses of 22,000 people, UpGuard said. Cultura Colectiva said in a statement that all of its Facebook records came from user interactions with its three pages on Facebook and is the same information publicly accessible to anyone browsing those pages. “ Neither sensitive nor private data, like emails or passwords, were amongst those because we do not have access to that kind of data, so we did not put our users’ privacy and security at risk,” Cultura Colectiva said. “We are aware of the potential uses of data in current times, so we have reinforced our security measures to protect the data and privacy of our Facebook fanpages’ users.”
Source : reuters.com Will Justin Trudeau’s Carbon Taxes Unleash a Yellow Vest Ascendancy in Canada? Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is following in French President Emmanuel Macron’s footsteps by instituting Draconian carbon taxes on his people to supposedly combat climate change. Trudeau is punishing four provinces that refused his push for higher taxation. He is imposing a tax of C$20 ($15) per ton, increasing by C$10 a year until it ultimately reaches C$50 in 2022. The tax will apply in the provinces of Manitoba, Ontario, Saskatchewan and New Brunswick. “As of today, it’s no longer free to pollute anywhere in Canada,” wrote Trudeau’s environment minister, Catherine McKenna, in a tweet. “Climate change is real … some politicians may not care much, but our kids and our grandkids do,” she adde d. Trudeau’s Conservative Party opposition is vowing to fight the imposition of this carbon tax in the courts. “We’re going to keep fighting this carbon tax with every single tool at our disposal,” Ontario premier Doug Ford said. “We now have four provinces representing half the population in this nation that say this is a flawed policy,” said Scott Moe, the premier of Saskatchewan, to the CBC. the Yellow Vests have already spread to Canada. An off-shoot of the French cause has been organizing for months, and the carbon tax push might be the fuel they need to take their efforts to the next level. The Yellow Vests of Canada have a Facebook group with over 108,000 members whose stated goal is “to protest the CARBON TAX and the Treason of our country’s politicians who have the audacity to sell out OUR country’s sovereignty over to the Globalist UN and their Tyrannical policies.” During their rallies, members of the movement echo familiar populist concerns.

Venezuela keeps oil exports stable despite US sanctions & blackouts – report Venezuela’s state-run oil major, PDVSA, managed to maintain crude exports at around 1 million barrels per day (bpd) in March despite mounting pressure from US sanctions, according to Reuters. The South American country stabilized shipments after exports fell by about 40 percent in February when Washington slapped Caracas with restrictions targeting its vital energy sector and pledged support for self-proclaimed Venezuelan leader Juan Guaido.

Washington getting concerned over Maduro’s ability to stay in power Maduro’s stay in power has the neocons and the DS as well as various regional neighbor countries worried about the situation. It seems that Venezuela’s neighbors followed a false promise to get rid off the Venezuelan President rather quickly. According to the report, allies of the U.S. are disappointed with the result and are now questioning their decision to recognize Juan Guaido as interim president. Self-proclaimed President Juan Guaido has also upped his rhetoric on a foreign military intervention as people start to question his own intentions. During a rally in Los Teques, near Caracas, Guaido spoke to a crowd of people expressing his will to have a foreign power bomb his own country. “Of course, we will refer to 187. We did not speak here between the lines, here we spoke very clearly. “ Referring to article 187.11 of the Venezuelan constitution, which regulates the authorization of a foreign military mission in the country.

The Amazon Seeks Alternatives that Could Revolutionise Energy Production,www.globalissues.org,,04-06-2019,2019,4,http://www.globalissues.org/news/2019/04/06/25177,"The Amazon Seeks Alternatives that Could Revolutionise Energy Production The Amazon Seeks Alternatives that Could Revolutionise Energy Production by Mario Osava ( manaus, brazil ) Saturday, April 06, 2019 Inter Press Service
MANAUS, Brazil, Apr 06 (IPS) - A large steel wheel, 14 meters in diameter and 1.3 meters wide, could be the energy solution of the near future, generating 3.5 megawatts - enough to supply a city of 30,000 people, according to a company in the capital city of the state of Amazonas in northwest Brazil. Milton Callera (holding the microphone) and Nantu Canelos, members of the indigenous Achuar community, explain how the two solar boats built to transport their people on the Amazon rivers of Ecuador work. The project is from the Kara Solar Foundation, which is promoting an alliance to ""solarise"" river transport in the Amazon rainforest. Credit: Mario Osava/IPS
An internal fluid, which expands through a chemical reaction in contact with an ink, drives the rotation that produces electricity without interruption for at least five years, say executives at Eletro Roda , a company in the city of Manaus that is marketing the invention and is building its first demonstration unit.
""Installation of the unit costs less than half that of an equivalent solar power plant and occupies an area of just 200 square meters, compared to 50,000 square meters for solar and 5,000 square meters for wind power,"" Fernando Lindoso, the director of the company in which he is a partner, told IPS.
In other words, in the space occupied by a wind power plant that generates 3.5 megawatts (MW), 25 electro-wheels could be installed, multiplying the generating capacity by a factor of 25.
In addition, it has the advantage of stable generation, ""free of the intermittency of other sources,"" said Lindoso, who estimated the cost of each 3.5 MW unit at around five million dollars, a price that is reduced for social projects.
There are interested parties in Japan, India and other countries in Asia, as well as in European and Middle Eastern countries, based on earlier prototypes that never made it to market, he said.
There will be a smaller version, generating one MW, ""30 percent cheaper"", of identical dimensions, but with three tons of the fluid that is biodegradable, instead of the four used in the other model.
This was one of the alternatives presented at the Fair and Symposium on Energy Solutions for Communities in the Amazon , which brought together more than 500 participants and 39 companies and institutions in Manaus Mar. 25-28.
""My favorite is the solar boat, a good example of how to find solutions,"" said Sam Passmore, director of the Environmental Programme at the U.S.-based Charles Stewart Mott Foundation , one of the meeting's eight international sponsors.
A large metal wheel that can be taken apart in order to facilitate transport produces electricity by rotating driven by an internal fluid, which is expanded by a chemical reaction. Producing 3.5 megawatts, the generator to be sold by Eletro Roda could produce a steady supply of electricity on just 200 square meters of space. Credit: Courtesy of Eletro Roda
An alliance for solar-powered transportation in the Amazon is propose by the Kara Solar Foundation , of the indigenous Achuar people of Ecuador, who since 2017 have built two 18-passenger boats powered by electricity from a rooftop made of photovoltaic panels.
Kara means dream in the Achuar language and it is about maintaining the sustainable culture of river transport, as opposed to ""the roads that threaten our territory, presented as if they represented development,"" project coordinator Nantu Canelos told IPS during the fair.
""We want to build 300, 400 solar boats,"" said Milton Callera, technical director of the Coordinating Committee of Indigenous Organisations of the Amazon Basin (Coica).
Riverside dwellers and indigenous people in Brazil are also seeking to ""solarise"" their boats, especially the small ones, dedicated to fishing and the transportation of a few people. The problem is where to put the solar panels on the so-called ""flying boats"", without slowing them down.
The discussions at the symposium, however, focused on the need to universalise energy. ""There are still 500,000 people, or 100,000 families, without access to electricity in Brazil's Amazon region,"" according to Paulo Cerqueira, coordinator of Social Policies at the Ministry of Mines and Energy.

The Light for All Programme, launched in 2003, benefited more than 16 million people, according to the ministry, in this country of 208 million people. But so far, isolated and remote communities, not reached by the power grid, have been excluded.
There are also millions of families who do have electricity, but are outside the National Integrated System, including the entire state of Roraima, in the northeast, with 580,000 inhabitants, on the border with Venezuela, from where it received most of its electricity until the supply crisis that erupted in March in the neighboring country.
Isolated communities in the state receive electricity mainly from diesel- or other petroleum-fueled generators.
The slogan for such cases is to replace costly, slow and unreliable transportation fueled by fossil fuels on the Amazon rainforest rivers, and to prioritise clean sources of energy. Solar power is presented as the most feasible solution, since the Amazon rainforest is not windy.
The exception is Roraima, where the state´s numerous indigenous people are studying the adoption of wind farms to help defend themselves from the impacts of the Venezuelan crisis.
Autonomous solar generation projects are mushrooming in the Amazon, in indigenous villages and riverbank settlements, sometimes funded by non-governmental institutions and international assistance, such as the German Agency for International Cooperation (GIZ) and the Rainforest Foundation of Norway .
Willi Seilert, from the I9SOL Institute, explains how his solar panels are manufactured, during the Fair and Symposium on Energy Solutions for Amazonia, held in Manaus. He has a project to disseminate a thousand small solar panel factories in Brazil, in order to make photovoltaic generation cheaper in poor communities. Credit: Mario Osava/IPS
As a result, companies such as Fabortec Solar, which installs photovoltaic systems and sells equipment, focused on designing and offering off-grid projects, incorporating batteries and equipment that ensure operation and maintenance by the users themselves.
""The Amazon is a great market for those who don't mind long trips and can work in places that are difficult to access,"" a company technician told IPS.
The expansion of solar energy in many parts of Brazil, not only in the Amazon, prompted Willi Seilert to design a plan to promote 1,000 solar panel micro-factories throughout the country.
This could make the product cheaper and facilitate access by poor families and communities to solar energy, in addition to training, employing and generating income for nearly 20,000 people in the country, he estimated.
That's why he founded the I9SOL Institute, where the ""9"" stands for innovation.
A 50-square-meter office, at least 10 people trained by two instructors, a glass-top table, an oven and a few tools are enough to produce small solar panels, he told IPS.
""The main obstacle is the import of photovoltaic cells, which Brazil does not produce and which has to pay too high a tariff, because of a strange legal measure adopted in 2012,"" he lamented.
In addition to this, there are two industrial processes for processing silicon, and ""the rest is packaging work that trained people can do without difficulty,"" he said, before pointing out that this continues to be the case in China and India, which provides employment for millions of workers, especially women.
The project is to be launched in Teófilo Otoni, a city of 140,000 people in the southeastern state of Minas Gerais, whose mayor plans to employ prisoners nearing release in the solar industry, Seilert said.
There are more energy alternatives in the Amazonian region. Experiments with the use of oil from the babassu (Attalea speciosa) palm tree abundant in the Amazon and neighboring areas, and from andiroba (Carapa guianensis), a tree with oilseeds, for electricity generation were presented at the symposium.
Railton de Lima , the inventor of the Eletro Roda, which he called a ""voluntary engine for mechanical energy generation,"" also developed a system for converting urban waste into charcoal briquettes to generate electricity, making it easier to recycle metals.
This technology is already used in several Brazilian cities, including Manaus. Of Lima's 28 inventions, more than half are already being used in the market, and others are being developed for energy purposes.
Creativity, which helps to seek more suitable alternatives, is also found in poor communities.
""The idea of the right to energy is powerful"" and stimulates solutions, said Passmore of the Mott Foundation. In the same sense, the diversity of peoples and communities represented at the Manaus meeting was ""a very positive factor,"" he concluded.

NERMEEN SHAIKH : We begin in Turkey, where President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s AK Party suffered major setbacks in local elections this weekend, after dominating the country’s political system since 2003. The AK Party lost control in both of Turkey’s largest cities, Istanbul and Ankara, and is now disputing the results. Voters expressed frustration with Erdogan’s autocratic rule and are also facing soaring inflation and rising unemployment. This is Erdogan speaking after the election.
PRESIDENT RECEP TAYYIP ERDOGAN : [translated] Every victory and every loss is the will of our nation. And we have to accept this fact as a necessity of democracy. We will admit that we won people’s hearts in cities we won, but we were not successful enough in cities we lost, and we will act accordingly.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : Erdogan’s AK Party has filed appeals to contest the results from all of Istanbul’s 39 districts, saying there were irregularities that need to be corrected, and demanding a vote recount. There have also been allegations of voter suppression in Kurdish-majority regions in the east of the country.
AMY GOODMAN : A party chairman called the election “one of the most stained in our democratic history,” he said. But other government officials have insisted the election was fair. A state-run news agency has said recounts are underway in 18 districts in Istanbul and 11 districts in Ankara. Stay in the loop
Never miss the news and analysis you care about.
For more, we’re joined by Koray Çaliskan. He is faculty fellow at Heilbroner Center for Capitalism Studies at The New School here in New York. He’s previously joined us from Istanbul, where he was an associate professor of political science at Bogaziçi University in Istanbul.
Welcome to Democracy Now! and to New York City.
KORAY ÇALISKAN: Thank you very much, Amy. Thank you.
AMY GOODMAN : So, talk about the significance of what has taken place in Turkey. Is this a real earthquake, political earthquake, for Erdogan?
KORAY ÇALISKAN: It’s a small earthquake in Richter scale, but it’s the beginning of the fall of Erdogan’s authoritarianism. It has a great potential, for two reasons. Firstly, 75% of Turkish GDP is produced by five cities that Erdogan lost—the top three plus Adana and—
SIRI : I found something on Adana: 5% of—
KORAY ÇALISKAN: Adana and Antalya. And that was Siri interrupting us. It’s unbelievable. Did you see what happened? Confirmed me that these are the top five cities in Turkey. This is unbelievable. Sorry about that. I thought that I turned it off. Digitalization is dangerous, as you see.
So, I think it’s a great moment for democracy now—not the program, but the world—because people have been seeing now that authoritarian leaders, who swing their competitive authoritarian regimes to full authoritarianism, who work on that, can actually lose when three things happen, which are the reasons of his loss. The first is, if the democratic forces do not buy into the polarization of the authoritarian leader, they win. If they have spent addressing Erdogan on the ground, they would be losing right now. Instead, they focused on their own agenda. They forgot Erdogan and just said, “This is what we are going to do. This is why we have to come to power.” Polarization off. Second, they didn’t take social media very seriously. Social media works to polarize. You’re a social democrat? Social media wants you to be a Stalinist. You’re right-wing? Social media wants you to be a fascist. All right? So they stayed away from social media polarization. They build coalitions with other sectors of the society, including right-wing democrats. Plus, the economic recession, that was the product of Erdogan’s mismanagement of the economy, helped them, too.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : Well, I want to go to the economic conditions in Turkey, which are really striking. In August 2018, the value of the lira, the Turkish lira, plummeted, losing 28% of its value against the dollar. Inflation is at 20%. The federal minimum wage has fallen by about 10%, etc. So, first, can you talk about what led to these conditions, because he was in power for 16 years, but the economy began collapsing only recently, and how his—obviously, he’s known, you refer to him also, as authoritarian—what were the principal features of his rule, 16 years?
KORAY ÇALISKAN: Fantastic. The first question, what really triggered this economic recession, it’s very difficult for people to invest in Turkey right now, because they don’t know what’s going to happen. The rule of law collapsed. I was indicted for trying to change the government of Turkey.
AMY GOODMAN : When were you indicted?
KORAY ÇALISKAN: I have been indicted 25 times. I got two jail times, total of three years, and then I have another court case. But I’m not alone. This is—whoever you are, whoever is criticizing Erdogan right now is held accountable for either terrorism charges or libel against the president charges. I have three years now, and probably I’m going to get two more. But they’re all deferred. This is how he’s silencing dissent.
This is what happens. When rule of law collapses, when judges begin to ask people, “Do you really want to change the government?” and when they say, “Yeah, this is democracy. My job, as an opposition, is to change government, right? I mean, when did this crime?”—they became so relaxed that they began to indict people for trying to change the government. Like Osman Kavala, who was right now indicted to change the government by terroristic means in organizing Gezi movement, which was ridiculous, because it’s a social movement of 71 cities in 73 cities of the Turkey, which is like more than 95% of the cities. Even Erdogan doesn’t have such a coordination power, right?
So, the economic crisis happened when people begin to pull back from investments as a result of collapse of rule of law. What would be the consequence of it? Imagine, when I was on your show, many times, from Istanbul, my salary was around $2,000 as a university associate professor in the public sector. Now it is around $1,000. So this means recession for, you know, middle-class people like us. Think about the working class, all right? Who are not even dreaming of making—
AMY GOODMAN : This is $1,000 a?
KORAY ÇALISKAN: A month. A month, not week. Yes, you might have thought about it, but this is what happens. And people begin to buy potatoes one by one instead of kilogram, which is two times more than pound, as you know. So, one potato, one onion. So, what did Erdogan do? He said, “Look, people are trying to play with our economy, all right, and this is terrorism, related to the United States of America and other foreign forces.” It’s always the foreign forces. And he put the blame on the eggplant terrorism, which kind of made it a little bit very difficult to understand the general people. When he says that, you know, “People who criticize me are terrorists,” people may—
NERMEEN SHAIKH : What does that mean, “eggplant terrorism”?
KORAY ÇALISKAN: That eggplant is so expensive now—
NERMEEN SHAIKH : Ah, I see.
KORAY ÇALISKAN: —that they are trying to address Turkish polity with eggplants and increasing its price. But his son-in-law is running the economy, right?
AMY GOODMAN : Explain, though—he recently extended his term, so what does it mean in these regional elections to have him lose in his kind of hometown of Istanbul and Ankara? The significance of this? And will this mean that his term could decrease?
KORAY ÇALISKAN: It may happen, and it may not happen. He still won more people’s votes. All right? But in this election, the grassroots activity made it possible for people to look at ballot boxes. Because elections are determined not by voters, but vote counters. You don’t have a problem during vote count, you may believe in democracy.
So, the other, second, very significant consequence of this election, Amy, is the following. It was an unlevel playing field. All right? Imagine the Super Bowl, and one team doesn’t have helmets and paddings. And then they’re trying to stop the other team. The team without the helmets and the paddings were social democrats. And they stopped AK Party’s Islamist team, with huge helmets, and referees were helping them, and they had paddings.
So, this is a great message to the world. Stay away from polarization of the autocratic leader. Believe in democracy. Believe in grassroots activity, not Twitter. All right? Work together, carry your message, and then keep an eye on the ballot box. Things may change in the next general election. This is the local election. But this is how authoritarian parties feed their electorate. All right? They use local city sources to send cash support to their electorate. And losing Istanbul and Ankara is a big blow.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : Erdogan said it himself, that whoever wins Istanbul wins Turkey.
KORAY ÇALISKAN: Exactly.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : And he was, of course, previously the mayor of Istanbul himself.
KORAY ÇALISKAN: Exactly.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : Now, could you talk about what has been happening in terms of the economic crisis in Turkey, also the relationship with the U.S., Turkey’s relationship with the U.S., which has now taken a turn for the worse after Turkey has bought or is negotiating an arms deal with Russia?
KORAY ÇALISKAN: Yes, S-40s [S-400], right? The arms deal is done, and the missiles seem to be coming to Turkey. And they didn’t back down from it, which is a big blow to its NATO alliances. You don’t want to buy guns from a dictator. All right? You want to strengthen your army, being loyal to your coalitions. All right? But it becomes very difficult for Turkey to be loyal to its coalitions, because President Trump created a context where world leaders and citizens around the world do not understand what the United States is trying to do. So, people do not trust in the United States and its leadership right now. On top of this, we had a bloody coup attempt, organized in part by Fethullah Gülen, who lives in America right now. And a lot of people in Turkey know that he was behind it.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : If you could just explain who he is?
KORAY ÇALISKAN: He is a cleric. He’s an imam, who used to, you know, help people pray. And then he built an empire, thanks to Erdogan’s political power. And Erdogan’s political power got authority, thanks to the empire that Gülen made. This is like—think about this as an inter-problem between Trotskyites and Stalinists in previous left.
AMY GOODMAN : But they were once close, Erdogan and Fethullah Gülen?
KORAY ÇALISKAN: Yes. So, they were very close. They were working together. And Gülen left Turkey for America and has been living here in a self-imposed exile.
AMY GOODMAN : In the Poconos.
KORAY ÇALISKAN: In the Poconos, yes, and in a huge campus. And what really happened was that his followers in the army organized a factionalist coup and failed, in Turkey, because everyone was against them—democrats, liberals, seculars, Islamists—and then they remained alone. So, Erdogan wants him to be sent to Turkey, for reasons that are legitimate. And the United States government says no. So this also creates a problem. Everyone in Turkey wants him back—Islamist or secular, anti-Erdogan and Erdogan—because Erdogan is a part of the legitimate political world in Turkey. Secular people are not afraid of Erdogan, but they would be afraid of Gülen, who has never been a part of the political society, stayed away, tried to affect it with other sources, like the military bureaucracy and the state ban.
AMY GOODMAN : But when we last interviewed you, I mean, tens of thousands of Turkish people had been arrested by Erdogan—
KORAY ÇALISKAN: Yes.
AMY GOODMAN : —dissidents, teachers, professors, all sorts of people.
KORAY ÇALISKAN: Yes, of course. Of course.
AMY GOODMAN : Now, this issue of global geopolitics, with Pence just this week—Vice President Pence—warning Turkey against going ahead with its planned purchase of the Russian-made S-400 missile system, hours after the Turkish foreign minister said the acquisition was a done deal, Pence saying this would be a threat to NATO—just as we wrap up, where Turkey stands now? You’re saying it’s—like many countries, they don’t know how to deal with an extremely unpredictable U.S. president. But where it stands now in alliances in the world?
KORAY ÇALISKAN: Amy, United States leadership is doing worst in trying to convince governments to work with itself. If Pence says, everyone, that Turkey has to learn a lesson, or we’re going to teach them a lesson, no one is going to take for it. And diplomacy is different than policies. S-40s [S-400] is not even a part of American politics radar right now. Why do you use this in order to alienate Erdogan? Just tell him what you could be done, and then move on. Instead, American leadership recognized Jerusalem as the capital and tries to, you know, say that, “OK, Syrians’ Golan Heights now can be Israeli property.” And then everyone is looking at it. This is coffee house talk. This is not diplomacy and politics. So, Pence made it very difficult for Erdogan to step back.
But Erdogan is known to change his positions very rapidly, if he thinks that—he’s a radical pragmatist, I mean, more than being an Islamist, and usually Islamists are very radical pragmatists anyway. And he can change his position, because, last time, when he tried to blackmail American government with a pastor, sending a pastor to jail and then home arrest, he lost it, and he had to send it back, because American sanctions led to a deepening of the recession and crumbling of the dollar, U.S., lira against dollar.

Americans want war on Yemen to end: Analyst,www.therussophile.org,Michael Sullivan,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/americans-want-war-on-yemen-to-end-analyst.html/,"This post was originally published on this site
A recent vote in the US House of Representatives to end the US-backed Saudi war on Yemen is sending a clear signal that the people of the United States and their representatives are not in favor of this war, an American scholar and political analyst says.
The House voted to end US support for the Saudi-led aggression against the Yemeni nation, approving a resolution that directs President Donald Trump “to remove United States Armed Forces from hostilities in or affecting the Republic of Yemen.”
“Today we took a clear stand against war and famine and for Congress’s war powers by voting to end our complicity in the war in Yemen,” Senator Bernie Sanders, a lead author of the resolution and a 2020 US presidential candidate, said after the House vote.
Kevin Barrett, an author, journalist and radio host with a Ph.D. in Islamic and Arabic Studies, told Press TV in a phone interview on Thursday that the fact of the matter is that American people were never really in favor of the aggression against the poor Yemeni nation, “but the representatives don’t usually represent the people.”
Barrett said the US representatives pursue a different agenda from that of American people. “That is the reason why so many of these wars for Empire get started and drag on despite the general lack of popular support … This is not what the American people had in mind when they sent Donald Trump to the White House on a mission to end imperial wars, interventions, regime changes and nations-building exercises, and concentrate the attention on securing our own borders here in the United States.”
Trump was made president by the Israeli lobby, according to Barrett. He named billionaire Sheldon Anderson, in particular, as the kingmaker behind Trumps rise to power.
Barrett said ever since Trump’s rise to power, he has been serving the Zionist lobby, which in turn supported the Saudis’ vicious and genocidal assault on the people of Yemen, “so that means Trump has to be in favor of it [the Saudi-led war on Yemen].”
‘Time to stage protests’
Barrett said it is high time for the American nation to stand up and let the voices of those opposed to the war on Yemen be heard.
Americans “never wanted this genocidal assault on Yemen,” Barrett noted. “We need to end this horrific policy and end the war in Yemen.”
The Saudi-led war has claimed the lives of about 56,000 Yemenis. The UN has warned that a record 22.2 million Yemenis were in dire need of food, including 8.4 million threatened by severe hunger. The UN says the famine in Yemen is the worst in more than 100 years.

The Ecuadorean embassy in London is set to expel Julian Assange within “hours to days”, using the corruption scandal leaks as a pretext, WikiLeaks claimed, citing a high-level source in the South American country.
The government of Lenín Moreno, which has long been annoyed by Assange’s prolonged stay at its embassy in the UK, will use the so-called INA Papers leak as the pretext to oust the whistleblower from the safety of the diplomatic mission, WikiLeaks said. It added that the Ecuadorean government has already worked out Assange’s expulsion with UK authorities, which will result in the journalist’s arrest. WikiLeaks to @AP : “If President Moreno wants to illegally terminate a refugee publisher’s asylum to cover up an offshore corruption scandal, history will not be kind,” https://t.co/XDKTvpRW3l
— WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) April 4, 2019
The corruption scandal which WikiLeaks referred to, it’s alleged that Moreno benefitted from an offshore account in Panama – allegations which the president strongly denies. On Tuesday the Ecuadorean leader once again attacked Assange and WikiLeaks, accusing them of hacking his phone and of intercepting “photos of my bedroom, what I eat, and how my wife and daughters and friends dance.”
Also on rt.com Bashing of Assange is linked to reportage on Ecuador president’s corruption scandal – WikiLeaks
Moreno also accused the WikiLeaks founder of “repeatedly violating” the terms of his asylum ever since he took refuge in Ecuador’s London embassy in 2012 to avoid being extradited to Sweden for questioning as part of a sexual assault investigation. While the case has since been closed, London still wants to arrest the 47-year-old for skipping his bail years ago. Assange fears he will immediately be extradited to the United States to face charges over WikiLeaks’ activities.
“US whistleblower Chelsea Manning, who the US government re-jailed a month ago to coerce her into a secret interrogation, as part of government efforts to prosecute @WikiLeaks, was moved out of solitary after filing appeals case,” WikiLeaks reminded followers in a Tweet.

May’s Deal Not Yet Back From The Dead,www.therussophile.org,Michael Shrimpton,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/mays-deal-not-yet-back-from-the-dead.html/,"This post was originally published on this site
VeteransToday Yvette Cooper, MP for the Cabinet Office.
Firstly, my commiserations to the Marine Corps and the families of Major Matthew Wiegand and Captain Travis Bannon over the tragic helo accident near Yuma, Arizona on Saturday. The Corps has clearly lost two fine men. May’s deal is like a zombie – it keeps trying to come back from the dead, with bits dropping off each time it does. Like a zombie, however, it’s still dead! The majority on Friday was smaller than the last time, but the shameful deal was still rejected. There is mad talk in London of bringing it back for a fourth time, in defiance of the Speaker, but it may not happen. Britain is still on course to leave the Evil Empire without a deal, although the thoroughly offensive and seriously defective bill sponsored by Cabinet Office stooge (no offense intended) Yvette Cooper may delay it for months, causing huge resentment and frustration in the process.
Leaving without a deal is still the default position in law. The EU has granted an extension of UK membership until May 22 nd if the Withdrawal Agreement is ratified by the House of Commons, April 12 th if not. After the deal was thrown out for a third time the UK was scheduled to finally break free from the stranglehold of the Evil Empire on April 12 th at 2300 hours British Summer Time. Subject to existing legal challenges the EU (Withdrawal)(No 5) Bill, which is likely to become law next week, will almost certainly mean Britain participating, absurdly, in the next European Parliament elections. Cooper’s mad bill is causing chaos, as she no doubt intended.
Not leaving on March 29 th was an utter humiliation for Theresa May. For over two years she has spouted the “Brexit Means Brexit” mantra, very obviously without meaning a word of it. She’s totally opposed to leaving the EU. Part of the idea of the Withdrawal Agreement was to track EU rules with a view to re-entering when political conditions allow, destroying sterling in the process, since new applicants to the EU have to sign up to the euro. The Cabinet Office of course are desperate to wreck the currency and make Britain a German vassal state.
Since it was set up in 1916 by the Imperial German Secret Service, with their man Maurice Hankey, a loathsome pedophile, in charge, the Cabinet Office has been run by a series of political criminals. The last Cabinet Secretary, murderous Euronutter Jeremy ‘von’ Heywood, signed off on GO2’s shameful plan to assassinate Labour MP Jo Cox, in a desperate effort to shore up the Remain vote ahead of the 2016 referendum.
Although widely seen as part of the British government, the Cabinet Office in practice is part of the German government, even if the food on offer in the canteen isn’t exactly German. This explains the tensions in Westminster. Theresa May is a house-trained idiot, no offense intended, and reports to the Cabinet Secretary, not the Queen or Parliament. The arrangement is as unworkable as it’s unconstitutional. America had a similar problem when the German spies George Bush Senior and Barack Hussein Obama were in the White House.
The Withdrawal Agreement is permanent
The majority against ‘May’s deal’ (in practice it’s Merkel’s deal, of course, dictated to Britain by Germany) was lower last time around because May promised to resign if it was approved. Since she’s going anyway it wasn’t much of a sacrifice – it’s a bit like a suicide bomber catching an earlier train. It was also strongly hinted that the hated ‘Oily’ Robbins, the Cabinet Office’s chief negotiator, would get the chop, albeit not literally (not yet, anyway).
The problem with that of course is that ‘Oily’s’ work is already done. The Withdrawal Agreement isn’t temporary, it’s permanent. The key German demand is that Britain couldn’t withdraw from it unless a panel of arbitrators agreed. Since the arbitrators would be reporting to Berlin (sadly, there is no longer such a thing as international justice in good faith) the only way out would be war. Had the deal gone through we would probably have seen another major Anglo-European war before the decade was out.
Like naïve young Vietnamese and Indonesian women accepting VX nerve agent from North Koreans thinking it was only intended to irritate, some Tory Brexiteers bought into the idea that there is going to be a ‘second phase’ of negotiations. Apart from a fake series of meetings there won’t be. It therefore doesn’t matter who conducts from them from the British side. It would be a bit like changing Leyton Orient’s coach in the hope that they could get into and then win the Premier League. The person in charge would be bound to fail, indeed Leyton Orient have a better chance of winning the League next year the new Tory PM would have of negotiating a decent free trade deal.
With the May/Merkel deal looking as doomed as the Munich Agreement (which if anything was a better deal) the PM, in desperation, turned to Labour’s Marxist leader Jeremy Corbyn. May’s cunning plan was to do an end run around Tory backbench Brexiteers. She might have been better off asking Nicholas Maduro for help. (She and Maduro would probably get on well together, since they share a similar contempt for democracy – each regards the people of their respective countries as peons, to whom things are done, not people with rights for whom things are done.)
If anyone in America has a spare copy of the Gettysburg Address could they please send it to Number 10? Mrs May would benefit from reading it, although it might take a few reads before President Lincoln’s points sink in. (I should explain that unlike President Trump, with respect, our Prime Minister is a bit slow on the uptake.)
The Legal Challenges
The European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 specified March 29 th at 2300 hours GMT as Exit Day. Possibly without having consulted the Attorney-General, who is a remarkably good lawyer with respect, for an Attorney-General, the government, strangely, failed to get Parliamentary authorisation for the proposed Article 50 extension. They also used a Henry VIII power in the 2018 Act to purportedly extend the operation of the European Communities Act 1972 beyond Exit Day.
I’m limited in what I can say, as I have been consulted over one of the two legal challenges currently under way. However both the extension to the Article 50 period and the extension of the hated European Communities Act without an Act of Parliament raise significant legal issues.
The English Democrats have commenced judicial review proceedings against the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union. A group of requested persons under European Arrest Warrants have separately applied for the warrants to be quashed, on the ground that they expired on Friday, i.e. Exit Day.
I should explain that under the rule in Attorney-General v. De Keyser’s Royal Hotel Ltd [1920] AC 508 the Royal Prerogative has no application in an area regulated by statute. As a result of Gina Miller’s legal challenge to Brexit, backed by George Soros, ( R (on the application of Miller and Dos Santos) v. Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union [2017] UKSC 5) service of the Article 50 notice required statutory authority. It follows that Article 50 is now an area governed by statute and Prerogative powers cease to apply. Whoops, as we constitutional lawyers say.
Our community partner the Kaiser
The background to the De Keyser case is well-known. In 1914 our community partner the Kaiser decided to start World War 1. It became necessary to greatly expand the Royal Flying Corps and the Secretary of State for War, purportedly using the Royal Prerogative, requisitioned the Royal Hotel at Blackfriars, London, in 1916. No one disputed the vital need of the RFC for more headquarters facilities. Without them the urgent work of killing Huns might have been held up.
After our community partners the German Air Force ( Deutsche Luftstreitfräfte ) had been defeated the issue arose of how to compensate the owners of the hotel. In a landmark constitutional test case, the House of Lords decided that the Prerogative had no application. That is because the power to requisition land had been placed on a statutory footing in 1914. The Royal Prerogative had therefore gone into abeyance.
The EU’s population
In an astonishing interview on the BBC Radio Four’s flagship current affairs program, Today , on Monday morning, the Europhile MP and Bilderberger, Kenneth ‘von’ Clarke, asserted that the EU’s internal market contained “500 million people”. As usual he wasn’t challenged – the BBC campaigned to Remain in 2016 and has long seen itself as a pro-EU propaganda organ.
The population of the EU 27 is in fact only 446 million. In order to get past 500 million you have to include the population of the UK! This is absurd, but is typical of the way in which the alleged attractions of the EU as a market are overstated by Euronutters. Not once since 2016 have I heard a Remain politician acknowledge that the official export figures to the EU are rigged by counting all exports via Antwerp and Rotterdam as exports to Belgium and Holland, even if they’re headed to South Korea. Mind you, if Ken Clarke thinks that Britain is in Europe he probably thinks that South Korea is as well! If they are any Democrats reading this, by the way, South Korea is in East Asia and Britain is off the coast of Europe.
John Major, an eponymous failure as Prime Minister
John Major’s interview
John Major, the nasty, pro-European beneficiary of the internal party coup against my old friend Margaret Thatcher, who infamously described Eurosceptic Tory MPs as “bastards”, called for a government of national unity on the Andrew Marr Show on Sunday morning. Very frankly the idea is absurd. Grand coalitions in peacetime are a German thing, designed to disenfranchise voters.
Major, like Lord Heseltine, continues to labor under the delusional belief that the EU was set up to bring peace to Europe. Peace in Europe was nothing to do with the EU. It came about because the Allies defeated our community partners the Nazis. The EU came later. Peace was maintained because of NATO and the Anglo-American alliance.
The brainchild of Reichsminister Funk, the idea of the EEC was to allow Germany to dominate Europe without having to conquer it, conquest having been tried and failed. Only in that sense is the EU an alternative to war. Since the DVD’s Helmut Kohl granted the UK an opt-out from the single currency in exchange for Foreign Office support for the breakup of Yugoslavia, and since Kohl’s policy led to the Balkan wars of the 1990s, it is historically illiterate to say that Europe has been at peace since the formation of the EEC in 1958. Again for the benefit of any Democrats reading this, the Balkans are in Europe. (Ken Clarke probably thinks they’re in Africa!)
Major also wants to ‘bring the country together’. This sounds very odd coming from the man who rammed through the Maastricht Treaty. The pro-EU lobby have never shown the slightest interest in national unity. From the very beginning the EU has been forced down our throats. When we rejected membership in the 1975 referendum our votes weren’t counted – the Cabinet Office simply rigged the result.
The petition
The media were much exercised by a silly petition organised by the Bad Guys, calling for Article 50 to be revoked. This allegedly attracted six million ‘signatures’. What the media conveniently overlooked is the fact that no one checked the signatures. It could have been three million people voting twice, or two million people voting three times. Moreover many of the signatories might have been European, indeed they might not even have been resident in Britain. Even if they were on the electoral roll for European Parliament elections they had no business signing a petition calling on Parliament to dishonor the promises made to the British electorate during the 2016 referendum.
Similar game playing was in evidence over last Saturday’s march. This seemed to have attracted only about 300,000 marchers. The media said a million, but you should always divide a media figure for pro-EU demos by at least a third. Again, many of the marchers were Europeans living in Britain. If anything the lower turnout compared to the last demo, and the numbers of Europeans taking part, suggested that support for EU membership amongst the British continues to wane.
State Trials
There was some confusion amongst readers over my comments about prosecuting key supporters of the May/Merkel deal. I was not suggesting that they be tried for treason. High treason is a statutory offense and in order to be guilty you have to be caught by one of the statutory categories. Signing a treaty, however much against the British interest it might be, is not treason, not in the criminal sense at any rate. Neville Chamberlain wasn’t guilty of treason at Munich, although he went on to commit high treason the following year, when he agreed Britain’s war strategy with Admiral Canaris, via intermediaries in Dublin.
If Parliament wishes to execute say Theresa May, the Cabinet Secretary and ‘Oily’ Robbins the way to do it would be to try them as Enemies of the State via an Act of Attainder. Since it’s primary legislation you simply define the offense in the bill – supporting the Withdrawal Agreement would be quite sufficient.
The mode of execution is decapitation by axe, the usual venue being the Tower of London. It would be done nicely, of course – a padre would be laid on, they would get a slap-up breakfast on the final morning and there would be fresh straw in the dungeons. It is entirely a matter for the Queen in Parliament, of course, as to who if anyone is going to be executed as a result of the Withdrawal Agreement. Obviously there are other potential candidates for an appointment with the State Executioner (who would probably be a retired NCO from the SAS with valuable experience of killing people), including Labour’s Yvette Cooper and Sir Keir Starmer, which would make it a cross-party affair.
Of course I am not calling for the execution of the Prime Minister, the Cabinet Secretary and ‘Oily’ Robbins. I am merely saying, as a constitutional lawyer, that their execution after a State Trial would be within the range of reasonable responses open to Parliament. When we constitutional lawyers say that ‘heads must roll’, like the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia we mean actual heads into actual baskets.
If there were to be State Executions they would be a great spectacle and huge fun, except for those being executed of course, but then they’re not meant to enjoy it. There would be no end of crimes against the State if executions were enjoyable. The cost of the scaffold, the executioners’ fees (an executioner and two assistants) and the new axes (you want them nice and shiny) would be more than recouped through selling the television rights. (No doubt the TV coverage would have to be marked ‘Parental Guidance’.)
If the Prime Minister, Cabinet Secretary and ‘Oily’ Robbins are arraigned at the Bar of Parliament on capital charges, not a matter for me, I would respectfully advise a stronger defense than saying that they did not feel like being executed, or that they did not approve of capital punishment. That’s just what Anne Boleyn said. Incidentally, if Theresa May were to be executed as an Enemy of the State she would be the first woman to be beheaded in England since Mary Queen of Scots. It would be her final contribution to gender equality.
‘Von’ Mueller’s report
The Democrats are reeling from the conclusions in Robert ‘von’ Mueller’s report. Since the whole thing was a conspiracy theory from beginning to end they shouldn’t be upset.
To repeat, there was no Russian interference in the 2016 election, no emails were hacked and nobody met with any ‘Kremlin’ lawyers. Mueller’s ‘investigation’ was conducted in bad faith, with party political fervor, and the President with respect should pardon those who were convicted, in each case of auxiliary or tangential allegations only. The prosecutions were political and a shameful abuse of process.
The power of presidential pardon is a vital constitutional safeguard against corrupt or overzealous prosecutors. It is an important corrective to a malfunctioning legal system, which like Britain’s, sadly, is broke, for the same reason – judges playing politics.
My Case
Talking about dodgy political prosecutions, Mrs Justice Jefford DBE is handing down judgment in the High Court in Cardiff on Monday in my appeal against disbarment by a Bar Disciplinary Tribunal. It is entirely a matter for the learned judge, with respect, but I was given a very fair hearing in January, and shown great courtesy, which I hope I reciprocated.
Shane Rimmer
Shane Rimmer (1929 – 2019) and Tania Mallett (1941 – 2019)
This week has sadly seen the passing of two fine Bond actors, Canadian Shane Rimmer ( You Only Live Twice, Diamonds Are Forever, Live and Let Die , all uncredited, and The Spy Who Loved Me ) and Brit Tania Mallet, who memorably played Tilly Masterton in Goldfinger . Shane Rimmer, famously, was also the voice of Scott Tracy in Thunderbirds.
Each was underrated in their lifetime. Shane Rimmer, unfairly, was seen as a minor actor, which rather ignored his considerable talents. He had a wonderful, distinctive voice. Tania Mallet never acted again after Goldfinger , which was a great loss to the movies.
Neither will be forgotten. The Bond films in which they starred will still be played centuries from now. More than mere stories, they are classics which will surely stand the test of time, partly because they teach eternal truths about the danger of power-mad maniacs. May Shane and Tania Rest in Peace.

VeteransToday The famous fake crematorium at auschwitz
By Sajjad Shaukat for Veterans Today Massacre of the Jews through various tactics of torture in the concentration camps, erected by Hitler before and during the World War 11 is still shocking and condemnable. It was a big tragedy, popularly known as the Holocaust, conducted by the forces of state terrorism. But, before and in the aftermath of the 9/11 tragedy, the Zionist-Israeli-led America has been taking unjustified revenge of the Holocaust from the Muslims. Although other religious communities have also been facing terrorism related attacks, yet Muslims are especially paying for the Holocaust. Zionist-controlled American leading think-tanks and media have propagated that “genocide of 5 million Jews was carried out at the extermination camps, using tools of mass murder, such as gas chambers of Germany, Poland, Austria and Alsace”, while some Jewish-influenced Western scholars have estimated the genocide of the 7.8 million Jews. But, impartial writers, researchers and authors have opined, “Following the rise of Hitler there were no more than 4 million Jews, living in areas occupied by the Third Reich at the height of its power. Yet on June 30, 1965, the West German government announced that some 3,375,000 Jewish holocaust “survivors” had applied for reparations money. The International Red Cross had already reported in 1946 that of registered Jewish camp inmates no more than 300,000 could have died, and their audit to December 31, 1984 records a total 282,077 registered deaths of all internees in all German Concentration Camps from all causes.” Some Holocaust deniers claim: “The mass extermination of the Jews by the Nazis never happened…the Nazi command had a policy of deporting Jews, not exterminating them”, while some remark that the number of Jewish losses has been greatly exaggerated…that the Holocaust was not systematic nor a result of an official policy…only 600,000 Jews were killed rather than six million. All Jews were not killed through gas chambers, but also due to hunger, diseases and depression.” On the one hand, the Jews have made the Holocaust the greatest device of gaining sympathy, while, on the other, they have used it for wars, anti-Muslim policies, expansion and foreign-aid, and to fulfill the Zionist ambition of greater Israel. With the support of American-Zionist Jews who manipulate the Holocaust, Israel has also become the sixth strongest military power of the world owing to the US assistance. However, the holocaust of the Muslims had started in 1991, when the Islamic Salvation Front won nearly two thirds of the seats in the first phase of elections. Supported by the US and some Western powers, the army created panic and cancelled the second phase of the elections. That triggered a brutal civil war which lasted a decade and thus, killed tens thousands of the Muslims. American former President Bush (The Senior) remained silent over the illegitimate massacre of the Muslims. Besides, America’s child-killing sanctions against Iraq and Iran; late action to curb ethnic cleansing in Kosovo and genocide of the Bosnian Muslims were part of the Muslim holocaust. Everyone knows that Al-Qaeda and Afghan Taliban were created by the American CIA to fight against the former Soviet Union in Afghanistan. In this respect, former British Foreign secretary, Robin Cook stated: “Throughout the 1980s, he [Bin Laden] was armed by the CIA and funded by the Saudis to wage jihad against the Russian occupation of Afghanistan.” The then US National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski met Al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden and said about the militants (Mujahideen): “We know of their deep belief in God, and we are confident their struggle will succeed…because, you are fighting against the infidel Russians.” Afterwards, Washington had left Afghanistan in particular and Pakistan in general to face the fallout of a prolonged conflict—terrorism and instability. According to a report, more than 3 Mujahideen lost their lives in pulling the Russians out of Afghanistan. These Mujahideen who were trained by CIA, later become the Taliban, Al-Qaeda (New version) and the Muslim Brotherhood, Islamic State group (Also known as Daesh, ISIS, ISIL). They got the label of terrorists. Once Henry Kissinger stated “legitimacy is not natural or automatic, but created.” Under the cover of the 9/11 tragedy, the US President George W. Bush who was in collaboration with the neo-conservatives and the Zionist Jews, orchestrated the drama of global war on terror to obtain the illegitimate interests of Israel by targeting the Islamic countries and the Muslims. Bush who used the words, “crusade against the evil-doers” adding to the perception that the ongoing ‘different war’ against terrorism is actually a war against the Muslims and the Islamic countries also warned the world to choose sides by saying, “either you are with us or with terrorists.” It was due to employment of pressure-diplomacy on the weak states—Muslim countries like Pakistan, Indonesia, Libya etc., including almost all the Arab states which joined Bush’s anti-terrorism war. By exploiting the 9/11 carnage, Bush also got the sympathies of almost all the major Western countries, including NATO states which also joined the fake global war on terror. By justifying the unjustified war on terror, a number of Muslim countries were deliberately destabilized and converted into concentration camps to attain the political, economic and religious interests of the Jews and those of Israel. For the purpose, double game and false flag operations which still continue became the part of the American CIA, Israeli Mossad and Indian RAW. Their main target is Muslims and the Islamic countries, though false flag terror attacks also keep ongoing in the US and Western countries. The unjustified revenge of the Holocaust started when in 2001; the US-coalition forces attacked Afghanistan. Then, Anglo-American forces invaded Iraq in 2003, which was also changed in the concentration camp. During the invasion of Afghanistan and Iraq and after occupation, the brutal tactics of the US-led NATO like heavy air bombardment and ground shelling by the sophisticated war machinery, including special military operations and extra-judicial assassinations killed many innocent persons. Particularly, the US military strategic warlords who preferred to create a paralyzing effect of ‘shock and awe’ displayed the terrible inferno of destruction in Afghanistan and Iraq. In this regard, the forces of the Northern Alliance, supported by America had killed hundreds of the Taliban through air strike, who had taken shelter in the Jangi Fort, besieged by the former. Even if, the Muslim fighters, hiding in the fort, did not want to surrender as the Americans claimed, the former could come out within fifteen or twenty days due to hunger and thirst. In another event, the US-backed Northern Alliance fighters had massacred about seven thousand Taliban who were prisoners and were being moved from Kandhar to Kabul in containers. In case of Iraq, many of the Iraqis, including some members of the former Interim Governing Council were shocked at the violence in Fallujah. Even the US weekly, ‘Newsweek’ admitted in its publication of April 19/April 26, 2004 that the US forces “used very heavy hand in Fallujah where more than 400 people were killed. Four members of the [former] Governing Council resigned in a protest against America’s crackdown in Fallujah…according to doctors figure of the deaths was impossible to check and it is more than 400…an airstrike dropped a 500 pound bomb. Arab language TV claimed that the bomb killed more than a score of civilians at prayer.” Like Afghanistan, American soldiers also massacred many wounded people and civilians in Iraq. In November, 2004, a number of world’s televised channels, including those of America showed footage of a US marine who was shooting and killing an already captive and wounded Iraqi prisoner at close range in a mosque in Fallujah where civilians had taken shelter. It is mentionable that the US-led troops, assisted by CIA have carried out indiscriminate mass round-ups in catching up suspected Muslim men and women in Afghanistan and Iraq, including some Arab countries without evidence. Mossad has helped the CIA officials in arresting the Muslim men, having beard and ladies, wearing scarves. Besides Guantanamo Bay and Iraq’s Abu Ghraib prison, CIA torture cells were present in several Muslim countries and were also set up in ships where US secret agencies, including FBI and military personnel employed various methods of torture on the militants and suspected persons like physical violence and even murder. American notorious private military firm Blackwater also eliminated countless Muslims in Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan. When America implemented the plan of Rand Corporation and sparked a civil war between the Sunnis and Shias in wake of phony war on terror to promote the objectives of Tel Aviv in the Muslim World, the horrible scenes of deaths were witnessed in Pakistan and especially Iraq. In March, 2013, an investigative report by the British Guardian/BBC disclosed that acting under the direction of the top US officials; the CIA utilized a global network of secret prisons, foreign intelligence agents and torture centers in various Islamic countries, including Belgium, Thailand etc. where torture was conducted directly by American intelligence operatives. The report also mentioned atrocities of the US-backed entities, carried out in Bagram Airbase (Afghanistan), Guantanamo and Iraq—unleashed a deadly sectarian militia in Iraq which terrorized the Sunni community and germinated a civil war between Sunnis and Shias, and claimed tens of thousands of lives. It revealed: “At the height of that sectarian conflict, 3,000 bodies a month were strewn on the streets of Iraq. Rounding up Sunnis in American pickup trucks, the captives were thrown into secret prisons established in libraries, airports, and ministries. Anti-occupation politicians, human rights activists, and journalists were murdered. The purpose was also to terrorize ordinary Iraqis who opposed the US occupation.” In this context, the report focuses on the role of retired Colonel James Steele who worked with the Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and Gen. David Petraeus who also served as President Barrack Obama’s CIA director. Steele sent regular memos to Donald Rumsfeld who forwarded them to Vice-President Dick Cheney and President George Bush, while, thousands of Iraqis died and millions were displaced as a result of the chaos and brutal practices. As exact details of the death toll in Afghanistan and Iraq are not available due to the Jewish controlled media and their dominated concerned strategic institutes, some independent organizations have published their reports on the basis of randomly selected interviews of the household persons and the military officials. Some latest reports suggest that more than 3 million people, including civilians died in Afghanistan and Iraq. Following his predecessor, President Obama also continued the ruthless killings of the Muslims to complete the unfinished agenda of the Zionist Jews and Israel. Apart from air strikes on funerals, marriage-ceremonies and mosques in Afghanistan, he converted Egypt, Libya, Syria, Yemen etc. into concentration camps. As part of the US double game, CIA which created Al-Qaeda and ISIS, including Al-Qaeda’s Al-Nusra Front and Syrian rebel groups in fighting against the Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and Iraqi regime is responsible for the mass murder of more than 2 million Muslims who were killed in civil wars—ground and aerial strikes of the US-led Western countries, including suicide attacks and bomb blasts, conducted by Al-Qaeda and ISIS. Besides, during the fake global war on terror in these countries and Afghanistan and Iraq, especially in Syria, millions of Muslims became homeless. The plight of refugees—countless deaths, particularly of children due to lack of medical treatment and starvation has displayed the holocaust on larger scale. President Obama had also broken all the record of human rights by extrajudicial killings of the innocent people through illegal CIA-operated drone attacks in Afghanistan, Somalia, Yemen etc. in general and Pakistan in particular. It is noteworthy that through the war against terrorism, President Bush and Obama provided a golden chance to Israel and India to accelerate the systematic genocide of the Palestinians and Kashmiris by equating the wars of liberation in the controlled territories of Palestine and Kashmir with terrorism. Their forces have been employing military terrorism such as curfews, crackdowns, sieges, massacre and targeted killings to maintain alien rule on these territories. It is worth-mentioning that a number of investigative reports after lab-verification verified that since 1948, Tel Aviv used the banned chemical and radiological materials against the Palestinians, Egyptians and Syrians, and during various phases of the Palestinian Intifada, which resulted in to severe convulsions, the burning sensation, the difficulty to breathe, the vomiting and pain found in relation to the victims—mostly women and children, a majority of whom died in the long run. In 2006, during the war against Lebanon, Israel used banned chemical weapons like phosphorous bombs in Lebanon and Gaza, which killed 286 Palestinians and injured 4,200. After the destruction of more than 7,500 Palestinian homes and displacement of some 3,500 families by a brutal military operation, Israel started the barbaric blockade of Gaza in 2007 by preventing humanitarian aid to the Palestinians. This new phase of atrocities reminded the world of a concentration camp, set up by the Israeli Jews for the Palestinians in the modern era. Israel’s main aim was to collectively punish the Palestinian innocent civilians, condemning them to vast devastation, leaving them to imminent death, without bothering even for patients who were suffering from kidney and heart problems. Besides fuel, the occupying power deprived the Gazas of clean water and electricity to ensure that homes, hospitals, factories and shopping markets are not able to function, resulting into a miserable life for the Palestinians—and even to the eventual deaths of the most vulnerable. Nevertheless, Israeli brutalities in Gaza amounts to the brutal treatment of human beings which Jews themselves faced in the concentration camps, established by the ‘Hitlerite Germany’, but, they learnt no lesson. On January 23, 2008, after suffering from acute starvation including everything, Palestinians were forced to pour into Egypt from Gaza Strip through a border wall, blown up by the Hamas militants. This scene reminds the escape of Jews from Sobibar, a concentration camp, established in Poland during World War 11. In that camp, German Nazis had made the life of Jews so troublesome, even culminating to deaths that a number of Jews prepared a plan and succeeded in saving their lives through the ‘escape’. In July and August 2014, during Israeli war in the Gaza Strip, Israeli military bombed apartment houses, hospitals and the UN schools which were used as shelters and thus, killed 15,000 Palestinian civilians, including women and children. Earlier, in 1982, during the Israeli invasion of Lebanon, the then Defense Minister Ariel Sharon ordered to target the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps and martyred hundreds of Palestinian civilians. It is notable that India which has also secret ties with Israel left no stone unturned in crushing the war of independence in the Indian Occupied Kashmir (IOK). Encouraged by the double standards of America and the US-led Western powers regarding the solution of Kashmir issue, both open and clandestine techniques of state terrorism have been employed by the Indian security forces to suppress the struggle of Kashmiris who are fighting for their genuine right of self-determination, as recognized by the UN resolutions. Various forms of state terrorism have been part of a deliberate campaign by the Indian army and paramilitary forces against the Muslim Kashmiris, particularly since 1989. It has been manifested in brutal tactics like crackdowns, curfews, illegal detentions, massacre, targeted killings, sieges, burning the houses, torture, disappearances, rape, breaking the legs, molestation of Muslim women and killing of persons through fake encounters. Besides Human Rights Watch, in its report on July 2, 2015, the Amnesty International has highlighted extrajudicial killings of the innocent persons at the hands of Indian security forces in the Indian Held Kashmir. The report said, “Tens of thousands of security forces are deployed in Indian-administered Kashmir…the Armed Forces Special Powers Act allows troops to shoot to kill suspected militants or arrest them without a warrant…not a single member of the armed forces has been tried in a civilian court for violating human rights in Kashmir…this lack of accountability has in turn facilitated other serious abuses…India has martyred one 100,000 people. More than 8,000 disappeared (while) in the custody of army and state police.” It is of particular attention that in 2008, a rights group reported unmarked graves in 55 villages across the northern regions of the Indian Occupied Kashmir (IOK). Then researchers and other groups reported finding thousands of mass graves without markers. In this respect, in August, 2011, Indian Jammu and Kashmir State Human Rights Commission officially acknowledged in its report that innocent civilians killed in the two-decade conflict have been buried in unmarked graves. Foreign sources and human rights organisations have revealed that unnamed graves include those innocent persons, killed by the Indian military and paramilitary troops in the fake encounters including those who were tortured to death by the RAW. In the recent past, more unmarked graves have been discovered. In this connection, in its report, China’s leading News Agency Xinhua has unearthed more unnamed graves in Poonch of the Indian Controlled Kashmir. The report quoted the statement of Sofi Aziz Joo, caretaker of a graveyard as saying, “Police and Army used to bring those bodies and direct me to bury them. The bodies were usually bullet-ridden, mutilated, faces disfigured and sometimes without limbs and heads.” Some online authentic sources suggest that the latest wave of Kashmiri Intifada has witnessed cruel repression by the Indian armed forces; large numbers of the dead and injured have been youngsters. The pellet guns used by security forces have damaged the faces of 1600 people and more than 1100 people have partially or wholly lost their eyesight making 2016 as the year of dead eyes. In 2017, reports also disclosed that in the IOK, Indian security forces have also used chemical weapons against the Kashmiri civilians in violation of international law and Universal Declaration of Human Rights. In a development on July 4, 2017, the Indian Army had destroyed houses in Pulwama and killed 3 Kashmiri civilians. Upon recovery of the bodies, it was discovered that they were burnt beyond recognition. Sources report that Indian Army is emulating Israeli tactics by using white phosphorus bombs to destroy houses of Kashmiris suspected of harboring freedom fighters. So, New Delhi has converted the Kashmir into the concentration camp. In the recent years, the US-backed military regime in Burma (present Myanmar) has broken all the record of religious cleansing by encouraging Rakhine extremist Buddhists who butchered thousands of the Burmese Muslims belonging to the Rohingya Muslims through various brutal methods of torture. Eye witnesses disclosed that Buddhist extremists who are in majority in the country, torched several mosques, shops and houses of Muslims, while Burmese military and police have been found involved in genocide, targeted killings, disappearances and rape of Muslim women. According to reports, nearly one and half million Rohingya Muslims have been murdered since June 28, 2012, while more than 20,0000 are missing. On March 11, 2006, about the tragedy of Burma’s Rohingya Muslims, BBC reported: “They have been called one of the world’s most persecuted people….in addition to their almost total lack of legal rights, many have been regularly beaten by police, forced to do slave labour and jailed for little or no reason.” American-backed Dalai Lama, the spiritual leader of the Buddhists did not condemn the genocide of Burmese Muslims. In order to achieve their political and financial goals, the Washington, New Delhi and Tel Aviv had given a free hand to CIA, Mossad and RAW to support the previous military regime’s suppression of the Muslims of Myanmar. Tel Aviv also supplies arms and weapons to Myanmar covertly. By setting aside the demonstrations and protests in various Islamic countries and by leaders of human rights groups which raised pressure on Aung San suu Kyi, the de facto head of Myanmar’s government and a Nobel Peace Prize laureate had drawn international condemnation for failing to address the rights’ abuses of the Muslim minority. In fact, if the double game of George W. Bush franchised Al-Qaeda on global level, President Obama’s dual policy franchised both Al-Qaeda and ISIS as part of the anti-Muslim campaign to attain the unfinished agenda of the Zionists, Israeli lobbies and the neoconservatives in the pretext of global war on terror. The pro-Israeli American President Donald Trump has been openly acting upon the hidden agenda of Israel and that of the Zionist Jews. His decisions such as tough screening process for the Muslims and executive order regarding a ban on arrivals to the US from a number of mainly-Muslim countries, officially recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and the opening of the US Embassy in Jerusalem, recognition of the Syrian Golan Heights as part of Israel might be cited as instance. It is owing to the encouragement of the President Trump that the Israeli regime officially declared their status as “the Jewish State” where only Jewish people have rights to self-determination. The fanatic President Trump is inciting the Christians and Muslims to conduct terror attacks against each other in the Western and the non-Western countries. Especially, he is provoking the non-Muslims to target the Muslims and their places of warships, as false flag terror attacks at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand on March 15, 2019 by Australian man, namely Brenton Tarrant who opened indiscriminate fire at Muslim worshippers killed 50 Muslims are notable in this regard. Sources of the Veterans Today confirmed Israeli connections of Tarrant. Likewise, besides similar assaults of the past, which occurred in the Western countries, four mosques in the British city of Birmingham were damaged overnight on March 21, this year in the latest in a spate of Islamophobic attacks. Intelligence services of the New Zealand and the UK have been stepping up investigations into far-right extremists. Notably, emboldened by the President Trump, the fundamentalist party BJP led by the Indian Prime Minister Narindra Modi has been implementing anti-Muslim and anti-Pakistan agenda. Assaults on Muslims by the Hindu extremist parties have been accelerated. It is due to the double game of America and some Western countries that CIA, Mossad and RAW are conducting false flag terror-operations through Al-Qaeda and ISIL and their affiliated terror outfits such as the Afghanistan-based Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan. Particularly, dual strategy of America and some of its Western allies have made the ISIL, the most dangerous militant group, which has rapidly spread its tentacles in the US, Europe, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, the Middle East and Africa. Apart from previous terror assaults in America, Europe, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, Indonesia etc., ISIL is also behind the recent bombings in Iraq, Iran, Syria and Yemen. Nonetheless, according to an estimate, more than 8 million Muslims (Excluding the missing persons) have been killed during the so-called war on terror and in various terror related attacks by the militant groups. The figure of Muslim fatalities is more than 6 or 7 million, which has, exaggeratedly been claimed by the Jews in relation to the Holocaust. While, the phony war on terror shows no end. Continuing the fake global war on terror, the fanatic President Trump who is in connivance with the extremist rulers of Israel and India seems determined to kill more Muslims even at the cost of patriot American (non-Zionist Jews), Christians, including those ones who are also being targeted by Al-Qaeda and ISIS. In these terms, Turmp’s anti-Muslim rhetoric can change the entire world into the Muslim holocaust. While, in 14 European countries and America, there are laws to penalize the deniers of the Holocaust. But, who will punish the President Bush, President Obama, President Trump, Zionist Jews, Israel and CIA-Mossad-RAW agents who committed war crimes and also remained in collusion with the Al-Qaeda and ISIS in a perennial scheme of mass murder. Without any doubt, we can conclude that the Zionist-Israeli-led America has been taking unfair revenge of the Holocaust from the Muslims who were not accountable for the Holocaust. But, they are paying for that tragedy, as the unjustified revenge of the Holocaust continues unabated. Note: The article excludes the non-Zionist peace-loving Jews.

"Feds Are Creating 9,000 Surveillance Zones in America (to Spy on 35 Million People)",www.therussophile.org,Alexander Light,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/feds-are-creating-9000-surveillance-zones-in-america-to-spy-on-35-million-people.html/,"This post was originally published on this site
Is there no end to Big Brother’s desire to turn America into a mirror image of China ?
An article in Go Erie, revealed how the Feds are classifying parts of cities as “Opportunity Zones” or as I call them “ Opportunity Surveillance Zones ” (OPS ).
The U.S. Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service are using Opportunity Zones to help law enforcement turn sections of cities into federally funded surveillance zones.
Mayor Joe Schember’s administration is using federal grants to turn Erie, Pennsylvania into an OPS.
“ The downtown smart city pilot project was announced in April 2018 and focused on downtown and Perry Square. New LED lighting, video surveillance cameras, and free Wi-Fi were installed in an area encompassing State Street, between Sixth and 12th streets .”
In three years, the city of Erie, Pennsylvania will be transformed into a massive surveillance city equipped with facial recognition cameras , license plate readers and spying public Wi-Fi zones.
“ According to Schember, that would include security cameras that could read license plates and have facial-recognition capabilities; energy-efficient LED street lights; and free Wi-Fi in public spaces throughout the Opportunity Zone tracts. The intent is to make those areas safer and more attractive for investment .”
Using facial recognition to make areas of the city safer, where have I heard that before?
It sounds eerily similar to a story, I wrote about last year.
The story was about Riverhead, New York politicians, claiming that police drones would revitalize downtown and “create a community connection.”
While the script may be the same, OPS’s differ slightly because they allow law enforcement to use facial recognition to identify suspicious people.
Karl Sanchack, the Innovation District’s CEO, said cameras will help “provide a general sense of flow for traffic,” and they will contribute to safety and security. They can also help identify “specific license plates of interest” for Erie police in high-crime areas, he said.
Feds are creating 9,000 surveillance zones in U.S. cities
Over the next 12 months Schember plans to create eight OPS’s in the Erie region that have been certified by the U.S. Treasury Department.
Wouldn’t it be nice if this story ended in Erie, Pennsylvania? Sadly that is not the case.
The Feds have big plans for OPS’s; in fact they plan on turning thousands of cities into mini-surveillance zones.
According to a Treasury Department press release , the Feds plan on using Opportunity Zones to spy on 35 million Americans.
“Nearly 35 million Americans live in the communities designated as Opportunity Zones.This Administration will work diligently with states and the private sector to encourage investment and development in Opportunity Zones.”
The enormity of this Federal surveillance program is revealed in another press release that says, “the Treasury Department has certified 8,761 communities in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and five U.S. territories. Nearly 35 million Americans live in areas designated as Opportunity Zones.”
Because who doesn’t want to be spied on by facial recognition cameras and license plate readers?
The National League of Cities says, that what makes Opportunity Zones so exciting is, “ there are few rules as to where the money can go .” Which is a perfect excuse for letting law enforcement turn our cities into Chinese-style surveillance networks like San Diego and Detroit .
We must not allow politicians and law enforcement to use Opportunity Zones as a vehicle to increase government surveillance ."
Artificial Intelligence Can Now Emulate Human Behaviors – Soon It Will Be Dangerously Good | Portside,portside.org,,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://portside.org/2019-04-05/artificial-intelligence-can-now-emulate-human-behaviors-soon-it-will-be-dangerously-good,"Subscribe Artificial Intelligence Can Now Emulate Human Behaviors – Soon It Will Be Dangerously Good Giving researchers and companies freedom to explore, in order to seek positive achievements from AI systems, means opening up the risk of developing more advanced ways to create deception and other social problems April 5, 2019 Facebook ,
When artificial intelligence systems start getting creative, they can create great things – and scary ones. Take, for instance, an AI program that let web users compose music along with a virtual Johann Sebastian Bach by entering notes into a program that generates Bach-like harmonies to match them.
Run by Google , the app drew great praise for being groundbreaking and fun to play with. It also attracted criticism , and raised concerns about AI’s dangers.
My study of how emerging technologies affect people’s lives has taught me that the problems go beyond the admittedly large concern about whether algorithms can really create music or art in general. Some complaints seemed small, but really weren’t, like observations that Google’s AI was breaking basic rules of music composition.
In fact, efforts to have computers mimic the behavior of actual people can be confusing and potentially harmful. Impersonation technologies
Google’s program analyzed the notes in 306 of Bach’s musical works, finding relationships between the melody and the notes that provided the harmony. Because Bach followed strict rules of composition, the program was effectively learning those rules, so it could apply them when users provided their own notes.
The Google Doodle team explains the Bach program.
The Bach app itself is new, but the underlying technology is not. Algorithms trained to recognize patterns and make probabilistic decisions have existed for a long time. Some of these algorithms are so complex that people don’t always understand how they make decisions or produce a particular outcome.
AI systems are not perfect – many of them rely on data that aren’t representative of the whole population, or that are influenced by human biases . It’s not entirely clear who might be legally responsible when an AI system makes an error or causes a problem.
Now, though, artificial intelligence technologies are getting advanced enough to be able to approximate individuals’ writing or speaking style, and even facial expressions. This isn’t always bad: A fairly simple AI gave Stephen Hawking the ability to communicate more efficiently with others by predicting the words he would use the most.
More complex programs that mimic human voices assist people with disabilities – but can also be used to deceive listeners. For example, the makers of Lyrebird , a voice-mimicking program, have released a simulated conversation between Barack Obama, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. It may sound real, but that exchange never happened. From good to bad
In February 2019, nonprofit company OpenAI created a program that generates text that is virtually indistinguishable from text written by people. It can “write” a speech in the style of John F. Kennedy , J.R.R. Tolkien in “ The Lord of the Rings ” or a student writing a school assignment about the U.S. Civil War .
The text generated by OpenAI’s software is so believable that the company has chosen not to release the program itself.
Similar technologies can simulate photos and videos. In early 2018, for instance, actor and filmmaker Jordan Peele created a video that appeared to show former U.S. President Barack Obama saying things Obama never actually said to warn the public about the dangers posed by these technologies.
Be careful what videos you believe.
In early 2019, a fake nude photo of U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez circulated online. Fabricated videos , often called “ deepfakes ,” are expected to be increasingly used in election campaigns.
Members of Congress have started to look into this issue ahead of the 2020 election . The U.S. Defense Department is teaching the public how to spot doctored videos and audio. News organizations like Reuters are beginning to train journalists to spot deepfakes.
But, in my view, an even bigger concern remains: Users might not be able to learn fast enough to distinguish fake content as AI technology becomes more sophisticated. For instance, as the public is beginning to become aware of deepfakes, AI is already being used for even more advanced deceptions. There are now programs that can generate fake faces and fake digital fingerprints , effectively creating the information needed to fabricate an entire person – at least in corporate or government records. Machines keep learning
At the moment, there are enough potential errors in these technologies to give people a chance of detecting digital fabrications. Google’s Bach composer made some mistakes an expert could detect. For example, when I tried it, the program allowed me to enter parallel fifths , a music interval that Bach studiously avoided . The app also broke musical rules of counterpoint by harmonizing melodies in the wrong key. Similarly, OpenAI’s text-generating program occasionally wrote phrases like “ fires happening under water ” that made no sense in their contexts.
As developers work on their creations, these mistakes will become rarer. Effectively, AI technologies will evolve and learn. The improved performance has the potential to bring many social benefits – including better health care, as AI programs help democratize the practice of medicine .
Giving researchers and companies freedom to explore, in order to seek these positive achievements from AI systems, means opening up the risk of developing more advanced ways to create deception and other social problems. Severely limiting AI research could curb that progress . But giving beneficial technologies room to grow comes at no small cost – and the potential for misuse, whether to make inaccurate “Bach-like” music or to deceive millions, is likely to grow in ways people can’t yet anticipate."
Be Ready To Act: WikiLeaks Source Says They’re Coming For Assange,www.therussophile.org,Caitlin Johnstone,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/be-ready-to-act-wikileaks-source-says-theyre-coming-for-assange.html/,"This post was originally published on this site
The WikiLeaks Twitter account has announced that it has high level information that the organization’s founder Julian Assange could have his political asylum the Ecuadorian embassy revoked for him to be arrested by the British government within hours. We need to be ready to shake the earth should this happen. We need all hands on deck for this one.
“BREAKING: A high level source within the Ecuadorian state has told @WikiLeaks that Julian Assange will be expelled within ‘hours to days’ using the #INApapers offshore scandal as a pretext–and that it already has an agreement with the UK for his arrest,” the leak publishing outlet tweeted , with a link to a story about the INA Papers leak.
The pretext that is being used is almost irrelevant, because it has nothing to do with truth or reality. Assange has been a target of the US-centralized power establishment ever since WikiLeaks began publishing authentic documents exposing the malfeasance of its leaders a decade ago, and strings are being pulled around the world to funnel him into its jaws. That’s all that this is, but it should surprise no one that the pretext is bogus as well. Journalist Elizabeth Vos wrote an article for Consortium News the other day summarizing the false narrative being spun by the Ecuadorian government that the conditions of asylum have been violated by the WikiLeaks account (not Assange) tweeting about a scandal that has rocked Ecuador’s president Lenin Moreno. BREAKING: A high level source within the Ecuadorian state has told @WikiLeaks that Julian Assange will be expelled within “hours to days” using the #INAPapers offshore scandal as a pretext–and that it already has an agreement with the UK for his arrest. https://t.co/adnJph79wq
— WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) April 4, 2019
To be clear, it is a known fact that the US government is working to arrest and imprison Assange, not for the Russia stuff that has had establishment loyalists so excited over the last couple of years, but for the 2010 leaks exposing US war crimes. The US has an extradition treaty with the UK, and the British government has refused to comment on whether or not it has received an extradition request for the Assange arrest that we absolutely know for a fact is an existing US government agenda. This would be the same US government which tortured Chelsea Manning after refusing her a fair trial .
If Assange is arrested and prosecuted under the Patriot Act, it will be a devastating blow to press freedoms and constitute a greater leap in the direction of Orwellian dystopia than the Patriot Act did. The US government exercising the ability to imprison journalists for simply publishing facts about it, not just in America but anywhere in the world, will be a poisoned dagger in the heart of the world population’s ability to bring any transparency or accountability to that titanic power structure.
“WikiLeaks reports that Julian Assange is on the verge of being expelled from the Ecuadorean Embassy in London,” tweeted the legendary journalist John Pilger in response to today’s news. “Please fill the street outside the embassy and protect him, and show solidarity with a courageous man, whose struggle ought to touch us all.”
Yes please. WikiLeaks reports that Julian Assange is on the verge of being expelled from the Ecuadorean Embassy in London. Please fill the street outside the embassy and protect him, and show solidarity with a courageous man, whose struggle ought to touch us all. https://t.co/xzZKroYJL9
— John Pilger (@johnpilger) April 4, 2019 We are about to find out if this is the part of the movie where the empire rips off the mask of freedom and democracy and reveals its true tyranny . Assange is a soft target, a controversial figure who has been on the receiving end of wildly successful smear campaigns marketed to every major political faction across the western world. He is the logical place to begin a crackdown on press freedoms and make a public example of what happens to those who shine the light of truth upon Big Brother. If we allow them to imprison Julian Assange for practicing journalism, that’s it. It’s over. We might as well all stop caring what happens to the world and sit on our hands while the oligarchs drive us to ecological disaster, nuclear annihilation or Orwellian dystopia. If we, the many, don’t have the spine to stand up against the few and say “No, we get to find out facts about you bastards and use it to inform our worldview, you don’t get to criminalize that,” then we certainly don’t have the spine it will take to wrest control of this world away from the hands of sociopathic plutocrats and take our fate into our own hands. The arrest of Julian Assange would be the fork in the road. It would be where we collectively decide as a species whether we want to survive into the future, and if we deserve to. Heads Up: the friends and supporters of 2019 Nobel Peace Prize Nominee Julian Assange will NOT let him be taken into the arms of torturers quietly.
We are organising en masse as I write this.
Eyes on the hashtag #ProtectJulian and amplify!!
— Suzie Dawson (@Suzi3D) April 4, 2019 So be ready to shake the earth if they decide that this is a good time to sink their talons into him. If they touch one silver hair on that man’s head, we must unleash relentless worldwide outrage the likes of which they have never before seen. Because we’re not just fighting for Assange, we’re fighting for our very survival. Jeremy Corbyn has spoken out in defense of WikiLeaks and Assange in the past. His moral character combined with his continual rise toward the leadership of the British government may partly explain the rush to arrest Assange as quickly as possible. In what was in my opinion one of the most exciting occurrences in wester politics recently, Corbyn read an excerpt from Percy Bysshe Shelley’s “The Masque of Anarchy” before an audience of thousands at the 2017 Glastonbury festival. Corbyn roared: “Rise, like lions after slumber In unvanquishable number! Shake your chains to earth like dew Which in sleep had fallen on you: Ye are many — they are few!” If Assange is arrested, that will be our cue to rise like lions from our slumber, which has gone on far too long at far too great a cost. We cannot permit them to use, exploit and oppress us like this anymore. We are the many. They are the few. Be ready to rise."
The Anti-Semitic Con Must Be Terminated Before it Terminates US,www.therussophile.org,State of the Nation,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/the-anti-semitic-con-must-be-terminated-before-it-terminates-us.html/,"This post was originally published on this site
By Paul Edwards
April 03, 2019 “ Information Clearing House ” – With the Putin/Russia Collusion Fairytale debunked, the undeniable cancer of real foreign interference in our government demands an honest airing.
Since American politics is mortally corrupt, one might wonder why bother to expose one prime cause of its ethical degeneracy. If the beast is dead, what use is determining what killed it? Well, it isn’t quite dead and we have to live with it. If the public knew one country has done more to subvert our government than all others combined it might raise enough hell to stop it.
In terms of influence, there can be no serious denial that Israel exerts by far the most powerful suasion of any foreign power on America. Influence exerted by a foreign power’s registered lobby is legitimate per our toothless protocol. Israel’s is not so registered, but… details, details. So, when Republicans invite Bibi to smarmily insult a sitting President in a joint session of Congress, that’s influence, not interference. When, besides financing most Senators and Representatives elections, Israel takes them on cushy, free PR junkets to Tel Aviv, that’s influence, not interference.
Conversely, when Clintonista subversion of the Sanders campaign appears on Wikileaks and is instantly imputed to Russia and Putin–without proof and against expert technical evidence–that’s not influence, it’s Russki interference. More absurdly, when–again, without proof–the same Dem CFOs howl that Putin Trolls bought chump change worth of dingy ads on Facebook that swung the election to Trump that’s… but you get the picture.
What is obvious and has long been so–and has been emphasized by two years of fraud and insanity regarding imagined Russian collusion–is that influence is what your friends have; interference is what your enemies do.
Why, when it is so blatantly obvious as to be a source of outspoken pride for them, is the fact that Israel’s right-wing ruling clique brazenly and continually interferes in American government in the most aggressive and offensive way, universally denied? You want flagrant foreign collusion with high officials in U.S. government? Open your eyes. And your mind..
The reason it’s officially denied is that Israel’s Congressional whores know that not to do so violates their deal. Not to back Israel unquestioningly terminates it, and the loss of that money means loss of office… to say nothing of the beating they’d take in the press and on their reputations.
The great mass of Americans won’t admit what many can’t help but know because they, too, fear being attacked for such bold honesty. They are equally vulnerable to rough handling from the same source: the massively powerful Israel Lobby, a unified phalanx of militant American Zionists.
To be clear: Zionism has always insisted that Israel exists for Jews only.
The Israel Lobby–financed by vast American Zionist wealth–potent as it is, could not leverage our politics if its tactics were exposed, and it knows it. History gives it the key that makes rational assessment of Israel’s policies impossible: the Holocaust and the true anti-Semitism that was its cause.
Evocation of that horror allows any critique of Israeli government to be sleazily labelled Anti-Semitism, and so to effectively nullify argument. The dishonest and cynical Israel Lobby uses this tactic shamelessly to blunt and derail sound criticism or even plain examination of Israeli state behavior.
What then is Anti-Semitism? By definition it is antipathy or hatred of the Jewish people as a whole. An Anti-Semite espouses that categorical prejudice, and Anti-Semitism in word or deed pertains to Jews in toto. In contrast, behavior that is ugly, hateful, or injurious but not directed at Jews as a whole, though execrable, is not Anti-Semitic, just as it’s possible to hate a Catholic or Muslim without hating their religion or their people.
It follows then, that criticism, even vicious, hateful criticism of the Israeli State, is not inherently Anti-Semitic, and the claim is false on its face. To attack the Israeli State is not to attack Jews as a people since Israel is not home to most of Jewry and its polity by no means defines or represents Jews in all their broad, complex range of beliefs, practices, and principles.
To say that criticizing the brutal, repressive apartheid Israeli government’s actions is Anti-Semitic is no more legitimate than to say that condemnation of the American State’s vicious imperialist wars makes one anti-American.
This disingenuous con needs to named and refuted around the world.
Is there criticism of Israel that is clearly Anti-Semitic? Of course, there is! Plenty of it. Anti-Semitism is no less real and evil because it does not apply to all critiques of Israel or all insults to Jews or Jewish entities. Precisely because Anti-Semitism is so vile and toxic a disease, and because it will continue to live in its odious carriers, it is critically important not to vitiate the ubiquitous contempt it arouses by cynically muddling its meaning.
[Ron: Whereas criticism of Germans and the fraudulent HolocaustBlood Libel of the entire German nation is NOT?!?]
The dishonest and defensive crying of wolf that the government of Israel and the Israel Lobby deploy against any criticism of their history and policy is, in addition to being morally contemptible, deeply counterproductive in terms of Israel’s standing in world opinion. Mounting a transparently false,
blanket, all-purpose lament as a cover for their most obvious and glaring crimes and cruelties cannot prevent the world from seeing them for the corrupt and unjust power they are and fiercely, adamantly opposing them.
Beyond the damage Israel’s cowardly dishonesty does to itself, a more critical concern for Americans concerns what it has done and is doing to exacerbate the rolling debacle of our misruled and floundering country. The Israel Lobby, Zionism’s American voice, wielding the bogus trope of Anti-Semitism as a club, infects and pollutes through its agents and activists every niche of our government from the Presidency and Congress, to Federal Departments and Bureaus, to State and local offices.
Without Zionist acceptance Trump would not have been President, but neither would Obama.
Through the Lobby’s diligence we have made our country hated by carrying Israel’s dirty water in the Middle East, crippled and hamstrung enlightened policy at home, and been afflicted with such creatures of nightmare as the Harpy, Nikki Haley, bughouse pseudo-Christian loon, Mike Pompeo, and murderous psychopath, John Bolton.
Nothing suggests the death grip Israel and its Lobby have on our fate can be broken. So long as the Anti-Semitic Con is viable, even our security is in jeopardy with its blind, sick, demented chosen monsters in charge.
The fable of the eagle and scorpion comes painfully to mind. When the bird, stung and bearing them both down to death, asks how the scorpion could sting it after swearing not to do so, it replies, “You knew what I was when you let me ride.” It was all too clear what Israel was in 1947.

Wouldn’t you know that the stupidest lawyers in the country work for California Law Schools!,www.therussophile.org,State of the Nation,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/wouldnt-you-know-that-the-stupidest-lawyers-in-the-country-work-for-california-law-schools.html/,"This post was originally published on this site
Campus Reform Two University of California administrators wrote in a recent op-ed that Trump’s campus free speech executive order is “unconstitutional.” The comments came after UC System President Janet Napolitano called the EO “unnecessary.” University Campus UC Berkeley, California, with golden bear and campanile visible.
In light of President Donald Trump’s executive order on free speech, Erwin Chermerinsky, dean of Berkeley Law, and Howard Gillman, Chancellor of the University of California, Irvine, penned an op-ed in which they state that the executive order does not help protect free speech on college campuses and that it is even “unconstitutional.”
“[T]he order is so vague and ambiguous, it makes compliance by colleges and universities extremely difficult — and it is almost certainly unconstitutional,” Chermerinsky and Gillman wrote for the Los Angeles Times .
“[T]he order is so vague and ambiguous, it makes compliance by colleges and universities extremely difficult- and it is almost certainly unconstitutional.” Tweet This
“There is no crisis concerning free speech on campuses in the United States,” Chermerinsky and Gillman add. “Every day on virtually every campus, speeches are given without incident, including some by very controversial speakers. Walk across either of our campuses on just about any day of the week, and the cacophony of diverse speakers is readily apparent.”
The pair’s opinion of Trump’s executive order goes a step further than that of the University of California System President Janet Napolitano, who previously called the order “unnecessary,” but not “unconstitutional.” When asked to comment on the difference in language, a spokeswoman for Napolitano’s office referred Campus Reform to the UC president’s previous March 4 and March 21 statements.
“The executive order that President Trump signed today is unnecessary. Like many higher education institutions across the country, the University of California is ground zero for robust exchanges of ideas and differing viewpoints,” Napolitano, a former Obama administration official, wrote in her March 21 statement .
In a statement to Campus Reform , Chemerinsky said, “Berkeley’s policies are open to all ideas and views. The campus has no discriminatory policies. Whether students and faculty are open to all political parties is a different question.” He went on to point out that Trump is the first to issue such an order: “I do not think a presidential executive order is needed in this area. No prior president ever found the need to do this.”
Despite such claims, however, Hayden Williams , an employee of Campus Reform ‘s parent organization, the Leadership Institute, was punched in the face in February while helping conservative student groups recruit new members.
Fewer than two weeks after that incident, Napolitano released a March 4 statement responding to Trump’s executive order announcement.
“President Trump’s announcement of a possible executive order mandating that colleges allow free speech on their campuses or lose critical federal research funding is misguided and unnecessary,” the system president said. “UC already has clear policies and procedures in place that protect anyone’s right to peacefully protest or speak on our campus.”
Williams’ assault by a former employee of the college reminded many of the 2017 riots that broke out at Berkeley over conservative provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos’ scheduled appearance, a “March for Trump” rally , and subsequent altercations.
Despite all this, the university holds that the executive order is not needed.
“We do not need the federal government to mandate what already exists: our longstanding, unequivocal support for freedom of expression. That tradition is alive and thriving on all of our campuses. This executive order will only muddle policies surrounding free speech, while doing nothing to further the aim of the First Amendment,” Napolitano said.

Peter Schweizer: Joe Biden ‘Steered $1.8 Billion’ to Ukraine While His Son Bagged ‘Sweetheart Deal’ from Their Government,www.therussophile.org,admin,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/peter-schweizer-joe-biden-steered-1-8-billion-to-ukraine-while-his-son-bagged-sweetheart-deal-from-their-government.html/,"This post was originally published on this site Peter Schweizer, president of the Government Accountability Institute and senior editor-at-large at Breitbart News, recalled how Hunter Biden, Joe Biden’s second son, received millions of dollars from Ukrainian energy company Burisma Holdings while his father directed $1.8 billion in aid money to Ukraine as vice president during the Obama administration.
Schweizer joined Tuesday’s edition of SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Tonight with hosts Rebecca Mansour and Joel Pollak.
Schweizer said, “I think a deeper problem that faces is — as has been reported on Breitbart and reported at the Hill , today — which I think is far deeper is the fact that his family, particularly his son, cashed in while he was vice president of the United States.”
John Solomon reported on Hunter Biden’s receiving millions of dollars from Burisma Holdings after being installed on the company’s board during his father’s vice presidential tenure:
U.S. banking records show Hunter Biden’s American-based firm, Rosemont Seneca Partners LLC, received regular transfers into one of its accounts – usually more than $166,000 a month – from Burisma from spring 2014 through fall 2015, during a period when Vice President Biden was the main U.S. official dealing with Ukraine and its tense relations with Russia.”
The general prosecutor’s official file for the Burisma probe – shared with me by senior Ukrainian officials – shows prosecutors identified Hunter Biden, business partner Devon Archer and their firm, Rosemont Seneca, as potential recipients of money.
Shokin told me in written answers to questions that, before he was fired as general prosecutor, he had made “specific plans” for the investigation that “included interrogations and other crime-investigation procedures into all members of the executive board, including Hunter Biden.”
“We’ve talked before about the deals he procured with the government for China,” remembered Schweizer. “The other place son, Hunter Biden, procured a big deal was in Ukraine. In Ukraine, it involved an energy company called Burisma, which is a very corrupt organization headed by an oligarch named Mykola Zlochevsky who is very close to ViktorYanukovich, the pro-Russian leader.”
Schweizer asked, “There’s all kinds of questions and implications. Is there a Russian component to this, because Burisma is such a corrupt company?”
“The bottom line is Joe Biden was the Obama administration’s point-person on policy towards Ukraine,” noted Schweizer. “He steered $1.8 billion in aid to that government and while he was doing so, his son got a sweetheart deal with this energy company – that we’ve been able to trace over just a 14-month period – paid $3.1 million into an account where Hunter Biden was getting paid.”– READ MORE

And the neocon-ization of the Trump administration continues. While The Donald is packing away Big Macs and Diet Cokes, his neocon secretary of state is appointing likeminded warmongers. Pleased to welcome Morgan Ortagus as our new @statedeptspox . Her experience as an intelligence analyst & public affairs officer in foreign policy & national security will benefit America. She’ll lead our fight to communicate & defend US foreign policy. Welcome to our team Morgan. pic.twitter.com/kSqTdPFNzv
— Secretary Pompeo (@SecPompeo) April 3, 2019
Ortagus is a deep insider with connections to both sides of the war party and its “creative destruction” directors on Wall Street and within prominent neocon “think tanks.”
From Bezos’ propaganda mill, The Washington Post :
Ortagus has been a fixture of the GOP foreign policy establishment for more than a decade. She has served as a press officer at the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), a financial intelligence officer at the Treasury Department and an intelligence officer in the U.S. Naval Reserve. She has also worked with several political campaigns, as well as a political action committee, and has experience working on Wall Street and in foreign policy consulting.
In addition to working with spooks and a federal agency that undermines elections and foments coups in foreign lands, Ortagus “served on the boards” at the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a coven of warmongers run by Kimberly Kagan, wife of notorious neocon Frederick Kagan.
ISW is funded by the death merchants—Raytheon, General Dynamics, DynCorp, and others—and it pushes the concept of the indispensable nation engaged in forever war around the world, a conflict promoted in the name of “democracy,” which is code for mass murder campaigns waged by the financial elite in its quest for total domination and theft of everything valuable on planet Earth.
Naturally, some folks over on the so-called “New Right” support the appointment of an ardent neocon—a former pretty face from Fox News—at the State Department, thus demonstrating they are little different than establishment Republicans, or for that matter Democrats. Congratuations to Morgan Ortagus our new @statedeptspox ! pic.twitter.com/gJnbLPlEBq

Jack’s photo of Ortagus in the jump seat of a fighter jet is appropriate. She will be covering up war crimes and pushing neocon propaganda on Venezuela, Iran, Syria, Russia, China, and North Korea.
Trump’s now largely forgotten promise to bring home the troops and get out of the “nation-building” (creative destruction) business was swept into the dustbin of history soon after the election.

I’d like to welcome the Australian people to the equivalent of a public flogging of an elected member in the Senate. Regardless of how many personal votes Fraser Anning may have received at the 2016 election, let me put on record that he still drew a stronger vote than a number of you sitting in this chamber here today. Just ask Liberal senator for Tasmania Wendy Askew. Senator, you sit here today after receiving zero votes from your Tasmanian constituents. In fact, Senator Askew joins us today as a result of the nepotism that runs deep through the Liberal Party. I’ve got no doubt your brother will be enjoying his plum job as Australia’s consul-general in Chicago. Come to think of it, Fraser Anning polled a stronger number of votes than the Greens senator for New South Wales, Mehreen Faruqi, who received zero votes in the 2016 election from her New South Wales constituents. You, Senator Faruqi , are regarded as a token replacement for Senator Rhiannon. Neither of you received a single vote from the Australian public, but you line up in this chamber hungry for this public flogging of Senator Anning. Australians were horrified at the murder of 50 people in Christchurch on 15 March this year, and we were horrified to think that these murders were at the hands of an Australian. Many of us thought Australia had witnessed its last mass shooting after the Port Arthur massacre, which resulted in John Howard, rightfully, introducing a ban on semiautomatic weapons throughout this country in 1996. But here we are, 23 years later, having to witness 50 innocent lives being taken at the hands of a crazed lone gunman. Hate, extremism and violence have no place in our democratic, civilised nations. I use this opportunity to reinstate One Nation’s commitment to a peaceful rule of law for all, in accordance with our democratic Constitution and acts of parliament. But, while Senator Anning’s comments following the mass killings in New Zealand were untimely and, therefore, deemed highly insensitive, he still maintains a right to his opinion. If One Nation endorses your actions to censure Senator Anning today, our freedom of speech, as elected members of this chamber, will be removed. Who will be the next member of parliament stopped from speaking their thoughts or the thoughts of the people they represent? We refuse to be led like sheep in this chamber and, therefore, we will abstain from voting on this censure motion. Our vote will not contribute to the demise of freedom of speech and nor will it endorse the timing or tone of the comments made by Senator Anning. The exploitation of these murders in New Zealand is offensive and each one of you should be ashamed of the manipulation of the events that day to suit your own agenda. The people of Queensland, not us, will judge Senator Anning, at the ballot box. Since the tragic event in New Zealand on 15 March, 65 additional terrorist attacks have been recorded across the globe. That’s 418 people who have died as a result of terrorism over the last 18 days. Is this the future that politicians in this chamber want for the people of Australia? With more than 600,000 people coming into this country every year for work, permanent residency and education purposes, we have left ourselves vulnerable to the same carnage that is on display in other parts of the world. Only days ago, Prime Minister Scott Morrison made the announcement that this government would give an extra $570 million in funding to Australia’s counterterrorism and counterintelligence operations. This is an admission that Scott Morrison’s government has failed to keep terrorists out of Australia. Let’s not forget—who opened the floodgates to the influx of these people coming to the country in the first place? The Labor Party. How many radical Islamic hate preachers have been allowed into Australia over the past decade, while we hear complete silence from Labor and the Greens on the vile language that spews out of their mouths while they indoctrinate and radicalise vulnerable Australians? You create a political witch-hunt when anyone dares question the immigration policy of this nation. The slightest whiff of protectionism in this country by the elites in this chamber sends you into a psychological frenzy. Governments and elected members have three primary objectives: adhere to the Constitution, manage the economic stability and rule of law in our country and, lastly, stop telling people how to run their lives and businesses. Instead of getting on with the crafting of a robust economic narrative for Australia by drought-proofing our nation with visionary projects like the hybrid version of the Bradfield scheme or establishing ways to bring back manufacturing or cutting power prices with the construction of new coal-fired power plants, they’re all here beating their chests. We’ve treated the people of this country with the same disdain and unworthiness that is thrust upon me and others who dare speak up—the forgotten voices of the nation. The Australian people have been treated like mushrooms—fed complete BS and been kept in the dark. That is where One Nation steps in. We see the anguish, hurt and pain on the faces of ordinary Australians. We take the time to listen to their troubles and what they have to say. The people of Australia watch you sell your souls and this country out so you can hold your seats in this chamber. What do you say to the generational farmers who have been forced off the land due to the pittance they are being paid for their produce and lack of water which governments have failed to provide? Your actions speak louder than words because you continue flogging our prime agricultural land off to the highest bidder overseas. It’s not foreign investment; it’s called foreign takeover. What do you say to the homeless who once had no visible presence in our streets? Today more than 100,000 Australians are homeless, yet you bellow from the rafters when we dare to call to redivert the $4.2 billion in foreign aid into helping our own people. You’ve left the support of our returned defence personnel to the will of God, instead of assisting them to address the mental and physical scars that our wars have caused them. What do you say to the aged pensioners who are stumbling around in the dark, too afraid to use electricity because they’re struggling to make ends meet, not even turning on their air conditioners and heaters because they’re too scared? Today’s censure motion is nothing but a public flogging, and One Nation won’t be part of it. TAGS "

Minister Clarks announcement yesterday shows the Government is listening to rural New Zealand and follows on from the rural proofing policy we introduced last year.
Those living in rural communities can enjoy excellent lifestyles but they face unique challenges that must be reflected in Government policy.
This past year alone has seen drought, floods and biosecurity incursions, which cause stress across in rural communities. TheRural Proofing Policyensures that when policy-makers sit down to design the rules they take into account the unique factors that affect rural communities such as low populations, isolation, and reliance on the primary sector for employment.

Developing rural health training hubs in which a range of medical professionals are trained inside rural communities is a great way to build communities up and encourage connections.
Weve all heard stories about rural communities finding it hard to attract GPs and other health professionals. This is a real concern. It means rural Kiwis arent getting the same access to healthcare as urban Kiwis - and that has to be fixed.

As comic goes head-to-head with Ukraine’s president, is the election becoming a circus? Published April 5, 2019 Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko submits to a blood test after a challenge by his opponent, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. (Courtesy: Petro Poroshenko) The first round of Ukraine's presidential election was a free-for-all lacking in policy details. The runoff is shaping up for more of the same.
UNITED NATIONS – Days after Ukrainians voted in a first round of presidential elections, a wide field of candidates has narrowed to two men: incumbent President Petro Poroshenko and political novice Volodymyr Zelenskiy, a comedian best known for playing a president on TV.
Nina Jankowicz is a global fellow at the Wilson Center’s Kennan Institute. “This was the most healthy and free and fair votes that I think Ukraine has seen since its independence. It is extremely democratic just to not know who exactly will be in the second round. There was a big question about that.”
But experts worry the upcoming runoff election is becoming a farce. Challenger Volodymyr Zelenskiy (UkrinformTV/YouTube.com)
On Monday, Poroshenko challenged Zelenskiy to a televised debate, an offer the actor accepted via a flashy online video in which he said the debate should be held in Ukraine’s massive Olympic stadium. And Zelenskiy had another demand: that both men submit to blood tests to check for alcohol and drug use, a media spectacle that unfolded on Friday. “Before, the campaign was very light on policy. Now I would say that the policy element of the debate is almost entirely non-existent, and that is what’s worrisome to me.”
Matthew Kupfer, a staff writer at the Kyiv Post, agrees: “There’s always been showmanship in Ukrainian politics. The concern is that, at least as an American when I look at this, I see shadows of the 2016 U.S. presidential election, where the media has taken a lot of criticism for allowing the showmanship, scandal and entertainment aspects of a presidential race to eclipse the policy plans and real politics.”
Zelenskiy’s anti-establishment streak fuels his appeal, but steering Ukraine through economic challenges and conflict with Russia requires as-yet untested abilities to assemble skilled advisers and withstand corruption – the kinds of skills that can’t be measured with more televised blood tests or viral videos. “Should it turn out to be three weeks of a circus, then really the independent media should focus very much on pushing them on issues.”"
Trump will skip White House Correspondents’ Dinner (again),www.talkmedianews.com,Washington Desk,04-06-2019,2019,4,http://www.talkmedianews.com/white-house/2019/04/05/trump-will-skip-white-house-correspondents-dinner-again/,"Trump will skip White House Correspondents’ Dinner (again) Trump will skip White House Correspondents’ Dinner (again) Published April 5, 2019 President Donald Trump answers reporters’ questions before he departs for California from the South Lawn of the White House on Marine One, (Photo ©2019 Doug Christian/TMN)
THE WHITE HOUSE – Before President Donald Trump departed from the South Lawn of the White House on Marine One Friday afternoon for California, he said he will not attend this month’s White House Correspondents Association dinner and will instead hold a rally that day.
Trump said that the annual dinner is too negative and that he is going to instead attend something “big” and “great.”
When asked where the rally will be held, Trump said he doesn’t know yet.
Trump has skipped the two previous WHCA dinners that have been held since he took office in January 2017, becoming the first president in 36 years to do so. Trump often expresses his contempt for journalists, whom he calls “the enemy of the people” and “fake media.” He frequently bashes CNN, the Washington Post and The New York Times, saying none of those news outlets gives him a fair shake. He has done interviews mostly with Fox News, which has a more conservative slant.
Traditionally the correspondents’ dinner has offered an opportunity for the president, his senior staff members and the White House reporters who cover him to gather with other prominent journalists, to break bread and share a laugh or two. The black-tie fundraiser raises money for scholarships for journalism students and also presents awards to journalists. Usually a nationally known comic serves as the emcee and pokes fun of the president and his administration as well as journalists. The media roasts the president and he reciprocates.
But last year’s emcee, comedian Michelle Wolf, was criticized for jokes that many people considered distasteful and that mocked White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders. She attended to represent the president and sat on the dais just a few feet from Wolf, the headliner.
Perhaps in response to that fiasco, the WHCA opted to ditch the roast this year in favor of having a keynote address by historian Ron Chernow. The event will be held at the Washington Hilton Hotel.
After the speaker was announced last November, the president had offered a glimmer of hope that he might attend the dinner. On Twitter, he had said he might consider going. So-called comedian Michelle Wolf bombed so badly last year at the White House Correspondents’ Dinner that this year, for the first time in decades, they will have an author instead of a comedian. Good first step in comeback of a dying evening and tradition! Maybe I will go?
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 21, 2018
It is not clear if Sanders or another White House staffer will attend.
As it did in the past two years, the WHCA seems to be taking the president’s rebuff in stride. The association’s president, Olivier Knox, issued a succinct statement on Twitter in response to the president’s decision: “We’re looking forward to an enjoyable evening of celebrating the First Amendment and great journalists past, present, and future.”
Trump spent his afternoon in Calixeco, Calif. where he hosted a roundtable discussion on immigration and border security. He then went to inspect a part of a U.S.-Mexico border wall. He is scheduled to attend a fundraiser in Los Angeles Friday night. After the fundraiser he will head to Las Vegas, where he is set to address the Republican Jewish Coalition’s leadership meeting. Vice President Mike Pence also is scheduled to speak at the event later in the day."

WASHINGTON – The Swiss government will represent U.S. diplomatic and other interests in Venezuela for an undetermined amount of time, beginning today, similar to what that nation provides for Washington in Iran.
“The United States extends our deepest appreciation to the Swiss for offering to undertake this important function and assist U.S. citizens on our behalf,” the State Department said in a statement to reporters on Friday.
The agreement, known as a “protecting power,” was reached in the wake of the U.S. closing its embassy and consulates in Venezuela in the face of increasing confrontation with Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. The U.S. says Maduro’s reelection as president was improper and support opposition leader Juan Guido; on Friday U.S. officials expanded sanctions on Venezeula entities.
While the agreement with Switzerland begins today, the Swiss government will not immediately be able to provide consular and others services to U.S. citizens, the State Department said.
“Where possible, U.S. citizens in Venezuela who require emergency assistance should continue to visit the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate in another country,” the State Department release said. “We continue to warn U.S. citizens against travel to Venezuela and urge remaining U.S. citizens to leave Venezuela immediately.”
The State Department said U.S. citizens who remain in Venezuela should enroll their travel plans in the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP.state.gov) in order to receive timely security alerts and updates on Venezuela.
Between 1961 and 2015, Switzerland was the protecting power of the United States in Cuba. It has been the protecting power in Iran since May 21, 1980."

(Audio: Jerry Nadler calling for Mueller’s summaries)
CAPITOL HILL- House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) speaks at a rally outside the White House calling for the release of the full findings of the Russia investigation led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller. This rally was one of hundreds throughout the country led by a coalition of progressive organizations, promoted under the hashtag #releasethereport.
These protests come as a series of leaked reports say that former prosecutors working in the Special Counsel’s office are disappointed that the four-page summary issued by Attorney General William Barr doesn’t accurately reflect the findings of the special counsel.
The chairs of six House committees — Judiciary’s Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.), Ways and Means Rep. Richard Neal (D-Mass.), Finance’s Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), Intelligence’s Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), Oversight’s Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) and Foreign Affairs’ Rep. Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.) — write a letter to Barr demanding he testify “as soon as possible — not in a month, as you have offered, but now” to discuss his rationale for issuing such an abridged summary.
Looking forward, it is often said that candidates need to run against their opponents to get elected, and need to lead the entire electorate to be effective. In the field of Democratic presidential contenders, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) is the penultimate fundraising leader with a $12.1 million haul this quarter. While Sen. Harris may draw well from the liberal base, she appeared to this reporter to be noticeably standoffish to Republicans, turning her back to them as she wended her way down the aisle in the House chamber for a joint meeting of Congress celebrating NATO’s 70 th anniversary. Barbara Grassley, wife of Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), noticed the same behavior and remarked on what she saw as Sen. Harris’ overtly partisan call for postponement of a Judiciary committee hearing her husband chaired confirming Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.

(Marine Corps photo)
WASHINGTON — A new conformation between China and the Philippines in the South China Sea has put the Pentagon on a higher alert just as U.S. military exercises are getting underway in the region, officials said Friday.
The tension results from Chinese ships continuing on Friday to circle one of the Spratly Islands occupied by the Philippines. Pentagon officials confirmed the latest reports from Manila that more than 600 Chinese ships have encroached Thitu Island this year — with 200 in the area on Friday.
China has declared ownership of all the Spratly Islands, despite claims by the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia, Taiwan and Vietnam. In 2016, the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague rejected China’s claim to sovereignty over most of the South China Sea and its islands.
However, neither that ruling nor U.S. protests nor even its own promises have stopped Beijing from militarizing many of the islands.
The tension between the Philippines and China is unusual since the president of the Philippines, Rodrigo Duterte, has stressed better ties with Beijing at the expense of Washington.
On Thursday, Duterte told China its presence was illegal and warned then to “lay off” Thitu Island or he would send troops, according to news reports.
“I will not plead or beg, but I am just telling you that lay off the (island) because I have soldiers there. If you touch it, that’s a different story. I will tell the soldiers ‘prepare for suicide mission,’” Duterte said in a speech, according to multiple news reports.
China has used military force to seize islands in the South China Sea in the past. In January 1974, the Battle of the Paracel Islands took place between the naval forces of China and South Vietnam, in which the South Vietnamese navy failed to expel the Chinese navy from an island claimed by Saigon.
The new escalation comes as U.S., Philippines and Australian troops commence “Exercise Balikatan” annual maneuvers. This year the exercise has an emphasis on amphibious operations, maritime security, humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, and counterterrorism, Pentagon officials said Friday. Balikatan means “shoulder-to-shoulder” in Tagalog, a major language of the Philippines.
Pentagon officials said F-35 fighters will be part of the exercises for the first time. The exercise is to end next Friday."

WASHINGTON — The Pentagon has launched a rare out-of-chain of command review of the events leading up to a fatal ambush on U.S. forces in Niger in 2017 — the third attempt by officials to obtain the full story and decide on full punishments.
“The appointment of a senior investigator outside of this chain of command is standard practice to ensure that conflicts of interest – or the appearance of conflicts of interest – do not taint any investigation,” Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.) told TMN on Friday.
“We are now two years removed from a preventable disaster that got people killed, and the Acting Secretary is still figuring out who needs to look into it,” he said. “It raises serious questions about the leadership at the Department of Defense that senior officers who may have had a hand in this disaster or who may have obstructed the investigation into it remain anonymous and unpunished while junior officers receive reprimands and the dead remain dead.”
Patrick Shanahan, the acting defense secretary, revealed the new review in testimony before Congress last week when quesited by Gallego. However, he did not detail the metrics of that review.
On Thursday, Charles Summers, the acting Pentagon spokesperson, confirmed to Pentagon reporters that “this is a new review.”
Summers acknowledged that the families of the slain U.S. soldiers were not informed of the new review before it was disclosed.
The Shanahan review will be led by Gen. Robert Brown, commanding general of U.S. Army Pacific — an area of command not tied to either Europe or Africa, where the decision making surrounding the fatal mission evolved, Pentagon officials said in interviews.
“I fear that he would not have initiated this review if I had not brought it up,” Gallego told TMN.
Sgt. La David Johnson, Staff Sgt. Bryan Black, Staff Sgt. Jeremiah Johnson and Staff Sgt. Dustin Wright were killed in the October 2017 ambush. Four Niger soldiers also were killed and four other U.S. service personnel wounded.
Then-Defense Secretary James Mattis rejected the initial examinations into the ambush. He ordered new reviews that were to be completed by December but parts were still lingering when Mattisleft office on December 31, according to sources interviewed by TMN who are part of the process.
The initial review that left Mattis furious was led by Marine Gen. Thomas Waldhauser, commander, U.S. Africa Command. It enraged Mattis as it blamed only junior officers for events.
The ambush occurred in the village of Tongo Tongo after the U.S. force was diverted from what was supposed to be a routine patrol and sent instead on a capture-or-kill raid ton an ISIS-affiliated militant. They were in the village for hours when the ambush occurred.
At one point Waldhauser was among those being considered for reprimand, several Pentagon officials said in interviews, but it was unlikely to occur. He is retiring this spring.
Among those reprimanded have been the commander of special operations forces in Africa, who was already set to retire; the leader of the Green Beret team that was ambushed; and a battalion commander based in Chad.
The deadly October. 4, 2017, day resulted from “the compounding impact of tactical and operational decisions” for the fatal ambush and “no single failure or deficiency,” according to the eight-page unclassified report released in spring 2018.
The report also said false paperwork was filed to achieve approval of the mission.
More than a dozen logistical changes in mission operations in Africa have been implemented since the ambush, Pentagon officials previously said."

Triple H Explains Tommaso Ciampa’s Appearance at NXT Takeover: New York,www.newsweek.com,,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsweek.com/tommaso-ciampa-nxt-takeover-new-york-gargano-1388026,"On 4/6/19 at 2:40 AM EDT Share Sports NXT WWE
On a night full of amazing wrestling, many fans are talking about the final moments of NXT Takeover: New York where former Champion Tommaso Ciampa appeared to congratulate Johnny Gargano after his victory over Adam Cole in the main event.
NXT fans know how long and storied Ciampa and Gargano’s rivalry is, and considering the dastardly Tommaso looked to turn Johnny to the dark side or destroy him in the process, it was a bit confusing. However, Paul “Triple H” Levesque explained the surprise appearance in a post-show press conference.
Tommaso Ciampa congratulates Johnny Gargano for winning the NXT Championship WWE
“You go back and forth on it and where you want to land on it. From a real standpoint, if you competitively look at this you want to succeed as much as humanly possible and you want to be in that spot,” Levesque said. “And when it gets taken from you, you want the guy closest to you to take that spot. That’s just sort of how it works.”
Ciampa and Gargano real life friendship is well-know, but what about from a kayfabe perspective? Triple H has an explanation for that too.
“Even from a storyline standpoint, the evil Tommaso Ciampa would want [the title] himself but if he can’t he’d probably want Johnny to have it. Even when they are entrenched in this war, he might as well have it if he can’t,” Levesque said. “It’s an emotional ride, knowing where he’s at knowing what he’s going through...It was a real moment and sometimes those are the best moments. You can’t script it and it’s the most meaningful in my opinion.”
Ciampa had to drop the NXT Championship in March after a neck injury Tommaso sustained became unmanageable.
“It went from something that was manageable to something we weren’t willing to risk,” Levesque said in a pre-NXT conference call . “We knew the length of time it would take to come back. Certain things are manageable. That situation changed, it progressively got worse and it wasn’t manageable for Ciampa and us.”
If you missed NXT Takeover: New York, it can be watched anytime on the WWE Network.

Takeover: New York , arguably NXT’s biggest show of the year, will take place Friday, April 5 at the Barclays Center.
Each title from WWE's NXT brand will be on the line, as well as the United Kingdom Championship, so fans expect the landscape of NXT and NXT U.K. to change tonight. There are five matches confirmed on the card and at least one new champion being decided due to vacancy.
That would be the NXT Championship 2 out of 3 Falls match between Johnny Gargano and Adam Cole. In March, reigning NXT champion Tommaso Ciampa had to vacate the title due to injury. Now, Gargano’s rise to the top of NXT can culminate with a win in New York tonight, but Adam Cole and his Undisputed Era cohorts will try to remind the rest of the roster how strong they are as a unit.
The NXT Women’s division has been anchored by the current champ, Shayna Baszler but her mean streak rubbed many in the locker room the wrong way. Baszler and her MMA compatriots, Jessamyn Duke and Marina Shafir, have intimidated most of their division rivals, except Bianca Belair and Kairi Sane who look to humiliate the Queen of Spades tonight. Baszler can lose the title even if she isn’t pinned during the Fatal Fourway, but will she find a way to continue her reign?
The future of NXT will be written in Brooklyn tonight. Here’s everything that happened at NXT Takeover: New York:

By all appearances notes SHTFPlan.com's Mac Slavo , President Trump is doing his damnedest to turn around the economy , revitalize jobs and bring back prosperity. But the larger trends are already in place; the cycle is turning, and the bust cannot be put off forever.
Federal Reserve policy has literally set the country up for collapse, and though the central bank has been very creative in making the impossible work, and putting off disaster, nothing can hold back the flood forever.
Unfortunately, it looks like Trump may be blamed for a financial crisis that he didn’t cause. Analysts, including notably Brandon Smith, may be correct in pinpointing the attempt to use the new and highly controversial president as a scapegoat for the dirty work of the bankers.
The conditions are there, and the consequences were built in when the bubble was still being pumped up. Someday it will burst. When, how, and how bad remains to be seen. Ron Paul: Economic Collapse Imminent - Trump will Get the Blame Instead of the FED
Authored by Jack Burns via The Free Thought Project blog ,
If former Rep. Ron Paul (R-TX) is correct, an Economic Doomsday is here. The second financial bubble is going to soon burst, and there’s nothing anyone can do about it. That’s because, as Paul stated, the Federal Reserve has set up the American economy for financial collapse for printing trillions of dollars back in 2008 and 2009.
“The Federal Reserve’s policies of printing trillions of dollars back in ’08-09 have locked into place a serious financial crisis at some point in our future,” Paul stated. Going so far as to intimate the financial collapse will occur at least some time in the next two years Paul wrote, “It’s unavoidable, and even Donald Trump can’t stop it.”
Paul said Trump will be the patsy for the supposed impending financial ruin. Just like everyone blamed Obama for the financial collapse in 2009, this time, “Trump will unfairly get the blame,” the former Texas representative wrote. Paul bases his comments on reports he says he’s read which concludes that within the next 18-24 months, the collapse will happen.
The former congressman further explained he’s still holding out hope for Trump to make changes which can help to protect America’s future, but pointed out some of Trump’s staff has direct connections to Wall Street. He’s also concerned Trump’s war against radical Islam is a war Trump cannot win because it’s a war against an ideology, much like America’s failed attempt at defeating communism.
Paul believes Trump’s moving in the right direction to protect America’s interests by canceling America’s involvement in the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade agreement with Asia. Paul also hopes Trump will pull American troops out of the at least 7 countries in which it is currently deployed and engaged in military conflict. “I say just come home,” Paul said when addressing having our military presence overseas. “Just get out of there and let the local people sort (the conflict) this out,” Paul said in response to how America should deal with hot spots like the Ukraine and Syria.
Paul believes the former administration’s posturing and threatening of China was misguided and stated we’d be better of trading goods with China, and all of Asia, rather than trading threats. However, as the Free Thought Project pointed out, Trump is already carrying on this dangerous posture — and China is responding.
Paul warns there’s going to be an acceleration of black ops operations by the CIA and Special Forces missions such as the joint special operations command (JSOC) which, as The Free Thought Project has reported, answers directly to the President of the United States.
Paul, who has never supported Trump is concerned about Trump’s ego, wondering if he’s going to act on his impulses to go after the ideology of radical Islam. Paul reminded his viewers that the way to create more jihadists is to keep on provoking the moderate Muslims into becoming radicalized by reacting to U.S. military actions overseas — the exact same thing Trump is doing right now.
Paul praised President Obama’s actions to normalize relations with Cuba and he hopes that with all of the policy decisions the Trump administration is making, that Trump will maintain the policy Obama implemented with Cuba and continue to keep the negotiations open with our closest Southern Caribbean neighbor.
Paul noted that he thinks U.S. policy has created a “failed system” in the country. “All empires end and we’re the empire. It’s going to end and it’s going to be for economic reasons…we’re going to fail because we’re working within a failed system…this is a monetary problem…a spending problem…it’s going to be financial,” Paul emphatically claimed, once again stating the collapse of America is imminent. “We have something arriving worse than 2008, 2009, much worse…It was the fault of the Federal Reserve,” Paul said, adding, the Keynesian economic model contributed greatly to the first bubble burst. Paul said the left will blame Trump for it like the right did to Obama, but he says it’s bigger than the office of the president, and blames the federal reserve and the previous 17 years of governmental spending.
If you think Ron Paul’s comments hold no water, think again. As the Free Thought Project reported last year, even the former chairmen of the Federal Reserve is predicting this crisis.
We are in very early days of a crisis which has got a way to go,” asserted Alan Greenspan to Bloomberg last year. “This is the worst period, I recall since I’ve been in public service. There’s nothing like it, including the crisis — remember October 19th, 1987, when the Dow went down by a record amount 23 percent? That I thought was the bottom of all potential problems. This has a corrosive effect that will not go away. I’d love to find something positive to say….. I don’t know how it’s going to resolve, but there’s going to be a crisis.”
When the man who used to run the very central bank Ron Paul says is responsible for the collapse, also says there’s going to be a collapse - it’s time to pay attention.

"Most Americans Think Social Media Is Bad, Even Dangerous According to New Poll",www.newsweek.com,,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsweek.com/social-media-bad-dangerous-toxic-facebook-twitter-1387203,"On 4/5/19 at 10:54 AM EDT Share U.S.
A new poll from NBC News and The Wall Street Journal shows a majority of Americans think social media is bad, and a dangerous, divisive force. The poll asked respondents about their thoughts on the president, candidates for the 2020 presidential elections, social media, privacy issues and more.
Most of the respondents in the poll, regardless of age, gender, race and political affiliation agree on one thing - that social media is bad and “does more to waste our time.” A whopping 82% of respondents said sites like Facebook and Twitter do more to waste people’s time than it does to help people use their time well. And 52% of respondents see social media as a dangerous dividing force, saying it's toxic atmosphere does more to pit people against each other than it does to bring them together.
The poll was conducted over five days at the end of March and involved 1,000 people, 48% of those who responded were male and the other 52% were female, according to the poll. Of those who were interviewed for the poll, 81% were registered voters and 19% were not.

When asked about the “increasing use of technology like smartphones and social media to communicate and stay in touch with people,” 61% of respondents said they saw it as a step in the right direction. Four years ago nearly the same results were evident when 60% of respondents answered the same way.
While many of the respondents thought that access to smart devices and social media was positive, they also reported that they were not satisfied with the amount of regulation the federal government has put on companies like Facebook.
More than half, 54%, of the respondents, said they were some level of dissatisfied with the current regulation, and 60% of respondents said they trust Facebook, “not at all,” with their personal information.
Facebook has had a number of breaches and data leaks that made its users vulnerable, the latest of which was only revealed this week and impacts millions of users, CNN reported . That latest data exposure also involved Amazon because the third-party apps responsible used Amazon cloud services to store the Facebook-user data that was exposed.
The poll found that 28% of respondents also trusted Amazon, “not at all,” with their information. Nearly all of the respondents asked said that they agree, online companies should have to delete consumer data if requested, and they should also have to get permission before selling or using that data, 94 and 93% of respondents were in agreement with those statements respectively."
'The Best of Enemies' Fact vs. Fiction: How the Film Compares to Real-Life Events,www.newsweek.com,,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsweek.com/best-enemies-fact-vs-fiction-true-story-real-events-1386460,"On 4/5/19 at 9:40 AM EDT Share Culture Movies & TV
The Best of Enemies sees Taraji P. Henson and Sam Rockwell explore the true story of an unconventional friendship that formed between a civil rights activist and a Ku Klux Klan (KKK) president in 1971. While most movies based on true events alter moments to make them more Hollywood-friendly, director Robin Bissell was committed to depicting the story as-is.
Ann Atwater (Henson) initially goes head-to-head in The Best of Enemies with C.P. Ellis (Rockwell) over the integration of schools in Durham, North Carolina. The pair eventually come together to serve as co-chairs for the Save Our Schools summit, which aimed to address the desegregation of schools. While Atwater and Ellis initially despised each other, they wound up forming a friendship due to their involvement in the community summit.
""We didn't really have to Hollywoodize the story because just reading it seemed fake already ... But then when you do the research and, you know, this stuff really actually happened,"" Henson, 48, told Collider in an interview published Wednesday. ""Her flipping that man around and hitting him in the head with the phone. All [of] that is true. None of that we, you know, embellished on—that actually happened. I think [for] everyone involved, we were interested in telling the truth.""
""It wasn't about a Hollywood moment. It was about a moment in history that actually happened. We are actually seeing again happening now in 2019. So that was the importance of the film. It wasn't about making [a] Hollywood movie. We didn't care about a Hollywood film. We wanted a film that is going to impact lives, change thoughts and perceptions,"" she concluded.
Sam Rockwell (L-R), Babou Ceesay and Taraji P. Henson are pictured in a still for 'The Best of Enemies,' out April 5, 2019. Annette Brown
Rockwell also told Collider that while The Best of Enemies aspired to stay completely true to the story being told, some moments were left out. The 50-year-old actor said the film ""can't fit everything in there"" because it has a two-hour runtime.
The events that inspired The Best of Enemies have been explored before in a play, a book and a documentary. Bissell's feature follows author Osha Gray Davidson's book, ""The Best of Enemies: Race and Redemption in the New South."" The New Yorker also noted the film's indebtedness to the 2015 documentary of the same name and ""the real people in it, to lend an air of authenticity to a story that he has freely changed in ways that downplay the controversies that were.""
While the film depicts the story of desegregation of schools in 1971, the landmark Supreme Court decision in Brown v. Board of Education deemed segregated schools unconsitutional back in 1954. Durham began to integrate its first schools in 1959.
Carvie Oldham (Bruce McGill) portrayed the film's mayor. According to The News & Observer , Oldham is a real person who served as an executive director of the Durham Housing Authority. However, the mayor at the time of the events was James R. Hawkins.
The Best of Enemies has parallels to 2018's Oscar Best Picture winner Green Book ,as both movies tell the story of an unlikely friendship forming between a black person and a racist white man. The family of Dr. Don Shirley, played in Green Book by Mahershala Ali, denounced the film and claimed the pianist wasn't friends with his former chauffeur Tony Lip (played by Viggo Mortensen). Unlike Green Book , Atwater and Ellis were confirmed to be friends in real life. Atwater addressed her friendship with Ellis to NPR in November 2005. He died three days before this interview.
""He stayed in touch with me; I'd call him,"" Atwater said. ""If I told him I needed some money, he told me he needed something, we looked after each other. We saw that each other, you know, was making it.""

"'Pet Sematary's Biggest Villain Is 'Greed' and 'Human Weakness,' Star Jason Clarke Says",www.newsweek.com,,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsweek.com/pet-sematary-2019-jason-clarke-interview-1386286,"On 4/5/19 at 9:00 AM EDT Share Culture Movies & TV
Pet Sematary is the latest Stephen King adaptation to appear on the big screen on Friday. Audiences who venture to their local theater may walk away wondering who, in fact, is the horror film's ultimate villain. Star Jason Clarke suggests that the villain isn't a particular character, but ""greed"" and ""human weakness.""
Directed by Kevin Kölsch and Dennis Widmyer, Pet Sematary is based on King's 1983 novel of the same name and is the second film adaptation, after the 1989 version. It follows married couple Dr. Louis Creed (Clarke) and Rachel Creed (Amy Seimetz) as they move with their children—eldest child Ellie (Jeté Laurence) and son Gage (Lucas Lavoie)—to a home in rural Maine that boasts a strange burial site for pets in the backyard. Louis later turns to his neighbor, Jud Crandall (John Lithgow), after an unfortunate family tragedy that leads to a series of horrific events.
In Pet Sematary , Clarke's character Louis is a grieving father. After his daughter abruptly dies, he's driven to do everything in his power to be with her once more. He turns to the place beyond the Pet Sematary that Jud showed him, where he ultimately resurrects her, but what returns isn't quite the daughter he once knew. Louis is wracked with guillt after causing havoc to his family. Jud is also at fault for improperly informing Louis about the dangers within the woods beyond his home.
So what's the malevolent force behind it all? Clarke has a rather unexpected take on that.
""I guess our own greed as humans. If you want to say 'let's put a villain in here,' that's what it is—our own personal human weakness,"" Clarke, 49, told Newsweek . ""It's one thing to think, 'what if you could bring your daughter back, would you?' But the other question for Louis, I always thought, was he knows this place brings them back. So what kind of parent is he if he doesn't try?""
""You get that much more clearly in the book, that he's got a plan if it goes wrong. You know, 'I'll just have to kill her.' Take the morphine and inject her. That's what he tries to do with the cat. He hopes it works. We all have that itch and we don't want to lose a child, particularly,"" he added.

The horror genre has enjoyed a kind of rennaisance of late, with 2017's Get Out unsettling expectations and offering a resonant, timely take on topics plaguing society. A Quiet Place , Hereditary and Bird Box followed thereafter and also resonated with audiences for their deeper explorations of human nature.
Pet Sematary has parallels to Hereditary , in particular, both family dramas about grief disguised as horror films touching on a demonic territory. When shooting Pet Sematary , Clarke thought he was ""making a drama.""
""It's a great meditation on being human, on what we are as people, on what we are as a family, what these things mean to us and the depths we would go to,"" he explained. ""There's even a bit of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein [in it]—you build the monster and the monster comes back and it's your daughter, but different.""
Clarke is ""glad"" to have been apart of Pet Sematary , but says he wouldn't want to relive the experience.
""It is a very disturbing part to play—thinking about what this man does, going up into the cemetery and getting a shovel out with a torchlight,"" said Clarke. ""King's got a wonderful way of just making it intimate and making it close to us [so] that we could understand it and believe it and imagine, well, what would you do?""

The Division 2 update 1.05 is live on PS4, bringing World Tier 5 progression, gear sets, new Exotics and a series of important bug fixes to the game. the full patch notes arrive courtesy of a post on the game’s official subreddit.
The Division 2 1.05 World Tier 5 Patch Notes
The World Tier 5 update also adds a couple new Gear Sets. Ubisoft
New Content Tidal Basin: A military base stronghold designed with high technology and intense difficulty in mind. After beating Tidal Basin, World Tier 5 progression is unlocked True Patriot, Ongoing Directive and Hardwired Gear Sets that drop from Black Tusk enemies or invaded missions. Weekly Invasions: Main missions with Black Tusk enemies that deliver high-tier loot. These can be replayed on multiple difficulties. Heroic difficulty for Main Missions and Strongholds. Fort McNair PvP map in the Conflict rotation. Exotics: Pestilence LMG and Nemesis Sniper. Apparel Event through May 2: Event caches contain unique cosmetics and are earned weekly. You can get more with a Year 1 Pass or by completing specific projects.
Weapons Mods and Gear Overhauled the Weapon mod system, see the table at the end of the patch notes for detailed information. Fixed a wrong long-range damage value for M4 (super 90) and P416. Previously, they could sometimes increase damage over longer ranges instead of the other way around. Rifles : Damage on the MK17 rifle reduced by 14%, also corrected this weapon not having a damage falloff over distance. LW M4 damage increased by 5%, RPM increased from 240 to 360. LVOA-C RPM increased from 240 to 380. Marksman Rifles Model 700 damage reduced by 13%. Shotguns AA12 damage increased by 16%. LMGs MG5 damage increased by 12% and fixed reversed falloff, causing the weapon to do more damage over a longer range. Updated initial accuracy on the Sig Sniper MCmillan T1. It should now be much more reliable to shoot as soon as it’s shouldered and the transition to scoped view is over. Reduced the amount of Critical Damage and Headshot Damage that can roll on Gear, including the amount on existing Gear. The actual values will differ depending on the level and quality of the gear it occurs on. This is partially in preparation for another world tier, where we felt these values were already at the limit of what was healthy in WT4. Complete overhaul of skill mods to give more achievable requirements and more reasonable bonuses. A closer equivalence between required skill power and the bonuses granted. Changed the amount of skill power on gear to not increase exponentially with level, but instead more linearly. This results in most skill power values on gear being lower, but in accordance with the lowered requirements. Tweaked the ranges of bonuses to be within acceptable bounds where they had extreme values before due to scaling errors. Most notably radius and ammo/charges values. Players will see both the bonuses and the requirements of almost all skill mods change as a result of this overhaul. In end game, both Superior and High-End skill mods exist to cover the different needs of different builds. They can overlap in power, but High-End mods have a higher maximum roll potential. We are looking at ways to provide lower value/quality mods in end game world tiers in the future to provide a solution to the fact that on very low skill power builds, there would be room for those mods, and currently we are aware that means you have to save mods from your leveling experience.
Player Skills ixed an issue which caused the Bombardier Drone to get destroyed while climbing up/down a ladder or rope. Improved feedback of Bombardier Drone crashing into obstacles during the bombing phase. Fixed an issue with Firefly payload sometimes failing to activate when reaching its target. Fixed an issue where Revive hive would not self-deploy if the agent was busy performing a different action such as using different skill when it triggered. Revamped the Sniper Turret version of the turret skill. It now will automatically target the hostile nearest to the players’ center-of-screen (the same method it uses to pick other turret targets) and will fire at that target when the button is pressed, without a lock-on order needed. If a player aims at a hostile, the sniper turret will attempt to match their aim, allowing precision shots using the sniper turret. An issue where the sniper turret wasn’t correctly getting bonus damage when hitting headshots has been fixed. Revamped the Chem launcher skill platform. Pressing the skill button will now equip the chem launcher similar to swapping to a weapon. The player can aim and shoot with normal weapon controls, as well as run with the skill and blindfire it. Quick deploy at the agents own position is still available for the repair version of the chem launcher, using the same controls as before. Unequipping the Chem launcher can be done using the skill button, the B (XBOX) / Circle (PS4) button or just using the weapon swap controls
Loot and Rewards Control Point reward containers are giving the correct number of items for the corresponding Control Point's defense level. Defense level 4 now awards 5 items instead of 3. Reduced DZ XP gain from Landmarks in Dark Zones. Reduced the quality and power for items dropped in Propaganda Broadcast and one drop of Settlement Blockade activities to be more in line with other open world enemies and activities. Updated XP rewards for low-level player playing in World Tiers to scale with player level. Supply Drop activity loot container items now scale with every consecutive container you open. This includes lowering the reward of the first crate, but results in similar rewards for the activity as a whole. Added 5 Specialized Apparel Cache Keys, awarded with levels 2 – 4. As a thank you for playing, all players that played before April 4 get 5 Specialized Apparel Keys, regardless of their level. Apparel Keys will be coming for those players later next week. Faction Key loot drops from Bounties are now guaranteed and are displayed in the loot preview. Adjusted bounty credit rewards to use scaling values in World Tiers instead of flat values so if a lower level player is playing with a higher-level player, they will receive an amount of credits more appropriate for their level. Changed Skill Unlock rewards to be non-invaded only so that players who co-op with a higher-level friend to play invaded before playing on story won't receive the rewards. Added Apparel cache key fragments to the PvP reward caches. Adjusted the rewards for the street execution activity to give slightly lower quality/source level gear so the rewards are more in line with the difficulty of the activity. Reduced the quality and source level charts used for item drops from the living world activities settlement blockade and Propaganda broadcast to be more in line with other open world drops and the difficulty of the activities. Updated Collectibles set XP reward to scale with player level. Fixed an issue which caused the Drone Helicopter to not use the correct loot table.
Crafting Increased Material cap for Standard and Specialized crafting materials to 400 (with all perks). Increased Material cap for High-End crafting materials to 50. Materials required for crafting weapon mods does not scale as aggressively and has much lower values in endgame. Removed a small increase on materials required for crafting weapon mods after upgrading the crafting bench quality. Changed the upgrade blueprints for exotic weapons Lullaby and Ruthless to not show up on the vendor until you are level 30. Increased the power for the wandering vendor so her inventory has a narrower Gear Score range closer to the top of the World Tier Gear Score Range. Set all exotic upgrade blueprints to award you the upgraded weapon on the max gear score of the current tier. Removed a tiny increase on materials required for crafting weapon mods after upgrading the crafting bench quality. Exotic weapons are now pre-equipped with lore text mods. These mods do not have stats and cannot be equipped elsewhere.
Talents Blind Justice – Modified the Buff that increases damage to your next shot now expires at end of combat and when out of combat First Blood - Updated Normalized MMR Talent First Blood Text to correctly explain that the first shot after reloading from empty is the enhanced bullet.
NPCs Decreased damage of all NPC Automatic Shotguns Decreased damage of all NPC SMGs Hey agent! Staff in the Base of Operation will now shout at the player less frequently than before.
Main Mission Difficulty World Bank – Invaded – Server Room ​ Increased the time which the Black Tusks needs to complete the download in the Server Room from 200 seconds to 250 seconds. Reduced the difficulty in the Server Room by setting the Enemy group composition to light, light, medium - Instead of medium, heavy, medium. DCD Headquarters Mission level has been changed from 17 to 18. Roosevelt Island – Invaded – Quarantine Docks Reduced the difficulty of the first wave of enemies encountered in the last beat of the mission by lowering the amount of Elite and Veteran enemies. Enemies in this part of the mission can only use mounted weapons if there are 2 players or more. This should make it less punishing for solo-players attempting this mission.
Open World: Removed death of civilian squad as a failure condition for Control Point takeover. The Officer will now remain in downed state until players complete the takeover or wipe. Black Tusk presence has been increased in invaded Open World zones. New Ambusher NPCs now roam the streets of DC.
Social Added a “Friends & Clan” option for Call for Backup that only shows calls from friends and clan members. Added a “Do Not Disturb” group privacy option that blocks all incoming invites.
PC Added a Field of View slider
PS4 xed an issue that could cause players to be stuck in the Specialization tutorial
Bug Fixes Fixed an issue where the Cluster Seeker Mine could split up more often than intended. Fixed an issue where the Defender Drone could have unlimited uptime. Fixed an issue which prevented players from finishing the Unite cypher riddle. We're confident this is not bugged anymore. Fixed an issue that would cause the Stronghold activation animation to always play when entering the Base of Operations. Fixed several instances of Audio logs not playing automatically when picked up. Fixed an issue that could cause players being unable to finish the Side Mission Worksite Community. Fixed an issue where players were unable to update their crafting bench after reaching a new World Tier. Fixed an issue with NPCs sometimes not reacting properly to cooked grenades Fixed an issue with Hunters not always appropriately despawning if a player flees a combat space Fixed rare issue where NPCs could get stuck when attempting to melee a player in cover Fixed issue with the Explosive Seeker Mine occasionally failing to path to its target Fixed bug where players could fast travel to non-friendly Control Points Fixed bug that made encounters with friendly NPCs requesting resources too rare Fixed bug where underground enemies would come to the surface during the day Fixed an issue where players were able to obtain gear with a higher gear score than intended Any owned High-End items will be lowered to Gear Score 500. Any owned Superior items will be lowered to Gear Score 490. Clan caches no longer award items higher than the maximum loot Gear Score. Recalibration still allows Gear Score to increase slightly past the maximum loot Gear Score. Fixed a bunch of weird stairs and invisible walls.
In short, The Division 2 update 1.05 seems to have lived up to its hype. Not only is there a ton of content for high-level players to experience, but those still climbing the ladder have a lot to look forward to in the form of Exotic quests, Gear Sets and opportunities to unlock top-tier items before heading into the Tidal Basin. Most Division 2 players are just hitting the level cap now, so this expansion arrives at the perfect time. These changes definitely skew to favor the game’s most dedicated players, but that’s generally how it goes in the looter shooter genre.
As far as bug fixes are concerned, there are quite a few big ones worth talking about. The MK700 and MK17 get a much-needed nerf, while the LVOA-C, Lightweight M4, the Shotgun AA12 and LMG MG5 receive a buff. The new Skill Mods system is also pretty interesting because it technically lowers the power of mods in the short term with a possible increase in power later on. It’s the kind of change that current players may hate, but those who properly spec their characters to fit certain skills will benefit greatly. It’s also no surprise to see that the controversial Weapon Mod system has essentially reverted to the positives-only model from the first Division . In general, these fixes make Agents feel more powerful in some areas without letting specific strategies dominate the meta. While players had to wait a while for it, there’s a lot to love about update 1.05
The Division 2 is available now on Xbox One, PS4 and PC.

The Unromantic Jordan Peterson,www.theamericanconservative.com,Rod Dreher,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.theamericanconservative.com/dreher/unromantic-jordan-peterson/,"Romance? Way more trouble than it’s worth.
It’s going to go the way of other Boomer fads like pensions, tambourines, and cheap education. Watched-a-lot-of-Peterson-on-Youtube April 5, 2019 at 10:14 pm
Completely disagree with the first section of what you quoted there. It is completely wrong on every point. For one thing, somebody who marries and divorces and marries and divorces, on and on, doesn’t value marriage at all. How can they? They don’t even know what it is. They created trainwreck after trainwreck for their children and grandchildren. That is not what Christ’s teaching on marriage does.
For another thing, I see Peterson’s comments on romance being more of a subset of his general observation about our ability to sustain happiness over long periods. He often argues that happiness isn’t the point of life, but meaning is. He thinks we should pursue meaning over pursuing happiness.
As far as sexual hierarchies, Peterson isn’t offering a prescription but rather a description. He’s not saying that it **should** be that way, but rather that human nature inclines it to that direction. The sexual revolution has made that worse. When practiced on a wide scale, Christ’s teaching on marriage flattens the distribution curve created by those hierarchies and worsened by the sexual revolution.
De Carlo’s argument implies that Peterson is advocating for those distribution curves to be more pronounced. I haven’t seen Peterson explain it the way I am doing so here, but I am very confident to say that Peterson would not agree with those distribution curves growing more and more pronounced. If anything, he would agree that marriage, real marriage, flattens those curves and that this is good for people and society. Anonymous April 5, 2019 at 11:23 pm
“Yet if these men and women truly desire to make sense of it all, to “straighten themselves out,” they would do best to disregard Peterson’s advice. They should instead embrace romance and throw themselves into love, of the truth and others, not out of some utility-maximizing scheme to climb the crustacean dominance hierarchy of neoliberalism, but for its own sake. Even if it costs them everything.
They should take their cues from Christ and Socrates, not Freud and Jung. Or, if they are less metaphysically inclined, they could simply take the advice of the Talking Heads: “Never for money, Always for Love. Cover up and say goodnight.””
That essay is a great example of all that is wrong with modern social conservatism. They know there is a problem, but in terms of coming up with a solution, it’s just “let’s sit around and see if we can use will to make the problem go away.” If the goal is to sound like a traditionalist while being minimally offensive to assure the corporate dollars keep flowing, it’s a good strategy. Peterson, since he at least flirts with action, (ultimately he is still somewhat imprisoned by the ideology of “classical liberalism”) threatens those who make a living by selling the do-nothing approach. James April 5, 2019 at 11:28 pm
> Reductionist and morally grotesque as Peterson’s “lobstertarian” vision of human interpersonal relationships is
Rod, please don’t fall for this misrepresentation of Peterson’s argument. When talking about lobsters and their neurological similarities with humans, he NEVER meant to advocate for a dog-eat-dog society.
His argument is much more subtle (and convincing), please have a read at the first page of 12 Rules for Live.
Usually Peterson’s critics come of with a misrepresentation of the lobster argument: is that because they just read the first ten pages of his last book? Anyway, let me repeat that the way the argument is misrepresented here is so gross that honestly I had doubts it’s been done in good faith. Pastor Brian April 5, 2019 at 11:38 pm
I haven’t had time to read all the comments, nor have I read the essay yet, but some of the comments are misinformed at best.
1) Peterson isn’t making the argument that since lobsters have hierarchies, people should too. Rather he’s making the argument that hierarchical social sorting is built into animal nature, including the human animal. This is clearly unavoidable and can be desirable. But he’s very clear that the desireable human hierarchies ought to be hierarchies of competence, not simply power. We ought to reward people who achieve competence and mastery of a desireable skill.
2. The folks who are screeching about this are egalitarians. But egalitarianism is little more than a useful political fiction. As CS Lewis points out in many places, people aren’t equal. They aren’t equal in strength or intelligence or moral character or initiative. By all means provide as much equality of opportunity as possible. Protects people’s God-given rights as though they were equal. But pretending that everyone is actually equal and demanding that we all bow to that nonsense is exactly the recipe for producing “men without chests,” as Lewis says.
3. The estranged young men who flock to Peterson haven’t abandoned Romanticism. They’ve been interlude defeated by heir inability to succeed at it. We see the impotent rage at not being able to participate in what Romanticism says is the key to human happiness every time some Aspergery, video-game obsessed incel takes a gun to a school or a theater and massacres people. They can’t get laid without paying for it, which society tells us is “love” so life is not worth living so they take their revenge on the world. If that’s not the legacy of romanticism, of the deification of impulse, then you can dip me in buttermilk and call me a biscuit.
3. Peterson is not encouraging everyone to become good little cogs in the capitalist machine. He’s telling people who feel paralyzed and powerless that they aren’t, and they can take some kind of action that they can build upon that will lead to some kind of real self actualization. Another hallmark of romanticism is that it relocates all action to the domain of response to impulse. If you have no impulse, no desire, you don’t “feel like” doing anything, then you are paralyzed. And many people today are paralyzed in just that way. Peterson shows how this cycle can be broken… how people can discover that what they do matters. That simply doing is transformative. I recommend Dallas Willard’s “Renovation of the Heart” for a deceptively keen, concise analysis of this phenomenon. Reading the Stoics helps too. I cannot imagine anything further from “go on and turn yourself into the Man in the Grey Flannel Suit like a good boy.” It’s more like “here’s a path through ennui and suffering to make your life mean something.”
I don’t think Peterson is infallible by any means. He is certain sub-Christian. But it’s a rather admirable sub-Christianity on the whole. His critics, so far as I can tell, are generally about as competent and informed as most of the critics of the Benedict Option. And they seem to be playing exactly the same game.

The true part is that Peterson is not much of a romantic, or much of a poet. It was interesting that the article mentioned DB Hart, who I usually like, but consider a bit unfair to Jung. Hart is more of a poet, and mostly doesn’t care for psychology (and, indeed, likes Neitzsche quite a lot).
One of Peterson’s strengths is his ability to bring the myths and aspirations down to the very small and mundane things that even quite sick or bad people have some access to. Hence so much advice along the lines of “clean your room, learn a skill, try using a calendar, pet a cat when you see one.”
As a clinical psychologist, he starts with the assumption that the person he’s talking to might be deeply broken and suffering quite a lot, perhaps not functional enough to clean his room or ask a woman out; perhaps ugly and smelly and constantly rejected. Probably not a poet in love with someone who loves him back — if so, he probably would be doing things other than watching Youtube psychology videos.
This is, I think, a strength. Some people fall in love with people who are good for them, form a stable bond, and are very happy with that person — they aren’t in much need of psychological advice. Other people are hurt and confused and think that it might be a good idea to change their gender and join a polyamorous commune in San Francisco. They should probably be told to consider not doing that.
The story Peterson likes to tell about hierarchies and marriage is his experience counseling 30ish high achieving attractive female lawyers (an odd niche to have been in, I would think). They would be super focused on career, and then around 30 realize that actually having a family was also important, maybe more important, and notice that it was hard to find a spouse. If they hadn’t gotten swept up in a romance by that point, they probably weren’t romantics either, and romantic advice wouldn’t help much. A person can’t necessarily decide to fall in love.
As others mentioned, the article mischaracterizes his lobster comment; that was largely in response to the idea of equity crusaders that all hierarchies are oppressive and socially constructed, with the implication that they could be done away with. He considers that very dangerous, and not at all true; that the tendency to form hierarchies are extremely deeply embedded, even at the neurological level, and every time a revolution has tried to abolish them terrible things have happened.

"Social Justice Indoctrination, Van Gogh in London, and Defining the Soul",www.theamericanconservative.com,Micah Mattix,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.theamericanconservative.com/prufrock/social-justice-indoctrination-van-gogh-in-london-and-defining-the-soul/,"Tweet Vincent van Gogh, Starry Night Over the Rhône (1888), via Wikimedia Commons
Good morning, friends. Life—well, politics—in America is crazy these days. Who would have imagined ten years ago that a gay man saying “all lives matter” would be denounced as racist ? But there is a kind of comfort in remembering that people have always been crazy. Take the example of the daughter of Henry I, Matilda, empress of Germany and nearly queen of England . Her life, Peter Marshall writes in a review of her biography, “contains more dramatic plot twists than a season or three of Game of Thrones . In 1110, her father, King Henry I, last of the sons of William the Conqueror, dispatched her to Liège to become the bride (on reaching twelve) of Emperor Henry V. The marriage ended childlessly with Henry’s death in 1125, but not before Matilda had been politically tutored to serve as her husband’s regent in Italy. Meanwhile, Henry I suffered personal and political catastrophe in 1120 when the White Ship , a state-of-the-art vessel carrying his son and heir William across the Channel, went down after striking hidden rocks. There had never been a queen regnant as opposed to a queen consort in England – and, as Catherine Hanley points out in this lively and illuminating biography, in English, ‘queen’, unlike ‘king’, usually requires a qualifier to make its meaning plain. But Henry was determined that Matilda, rather than any of his illegitimate sons, would succeed him. He required his barons to swear fealty to her and sought to provide her with political ballast by arranging her marriage to Geoffrey of Anjou. He was twelve years Matilda’s junior and the couple seemingly detested each other, but the marriage served its dynastic purpose in producing a trio of sons. When Henry himself died in December 1135, Matilda should have ascended to the throne, but the news was slow to reach her, and the old king’s nephew Stephen of Blois raced across the Channel to have himself crowned in Westminster Abbey, to the acclaim of supporters who, in the words of a later chronicler, thought it ‘a shame for so many nobles to submit themselves to a woman’. The barons of England and Normandy divided, and for the best part of twenty years the realm was plunged into civil war. Ordinary people suffered predictably and horribly; it was a time when, according to another chronicler, ‘Christ and His saints slept’.”
What do future teachers learn at the University of Washington’s Secondary Teacher Education Program? A whole lot about “social justice activism” and not very much about teaching .
Algis Valiunas reviews the new Diderot biography : “One hates to restate the obvious, but some matters require to be repeated until their dire significance really sinks in. Intellectual freedom and diversity are in danger of being expunged. Formerly respectable universities have become the province of a mentally barren professoriate indoctrinating new generations of virtuecrats, who have no room in their minds for any thoughts that might defy the latest orthodoxy. The outlook is grim, rich possibilities are being foreclosed, and the past masters who formed our civilization have become objects of loathing, not to be spoken of without scorn. So one is grateful for small mercies, and this praiseful new intellectual biography of the French philosophe Denis Diderot (1713–1784) offers hope that serious engagement with the past is still possible in the academy.”
What can Aristotle teach us about the soul ? “The soul is the most difficult and paradoxical thing in the world. In classical thought the soul is our form, which activates and animates the matter of our bodies and makes us rational and free beings. It thus provides our access to metaphysical being itself—the understanding of everything that is. The soul is the space where the light of philosophy shines. In Christianity the soul came to be understood as the spark of the divine or the image of God, and also immortal. (This latter view is ascribed to Aristotle by the disciples of Saint Thomas Aquinas.) A bit later, with the birth of modern science, the soul vanishes altogether. We speak today of the soul largely metaphorically and call the hard sciences “soulless”—by which we mean that chemistry, physics, and information technology are cold, deterministic, and heartless…David Bolotin, retired after a distinguished career at St. John’s College in Santa Fe, believes Aristotle can provide useful instruction here.”
Van Gogh in London : “As Vincent van Gogh’s Starry Night Over the Rhône goes on show at Tate Britain, it is, in one sense, coming home. This might sound like wishful thinking. For the past half century the painting has hung in Paris, and its singing Mediterranean colours, which the artist himself described as ‘aquamarine’, ‘royal blue’ and ‘russet gold’, bear little resemblance to the murky half-tints of the Thames, which runs past Tate Britain’s Millbank site. Yet its spring exhibition, Van Gogh and Britain , is organised on the principle that the foundations of the Dutchman’s art, both his eye and his intellect, were laid not in the south of France, nor in the misty light of the Low Countries, but in London, where he spent three life-defining years (1873-76) as a young man.”
Essay of the Day:
David Brown visits the island where George Orwell wrote Nineteen Eighty-Four :
“It’s hard to know what would be a good place from which to imagine a future of bad smells and no privacy, deceit and propaganda, poverty and torture. Does a writer need to live in misery and ugliness to conjure up a dystopia?
“Apparently not.
“We’d been walking more than an hour. The road was two tracks of pebbled dirt separated by a strip of grass. The land was treeless as prairie, with wildflowers and the seedless tops of last year’s grass smudging the new growth.
“We rounded a curve and looked down a hillside to the sea. A half mile in the distance, far back from the water, was a white house with three dormer windows. Behind it, a stone wall cut a diagonal to the water like a seam stitching mismatched pieces of green velvet. Far to the right, a boat moved along the shore, its sail as bright as the house.
“This was where George Orwell wrote Nineteen Eighty-Four . The house, called Barnhill, sits near the northern end of Jura, an island off Scotland’s west coast in the Inner Hebrides. It was June 2, sunny, short-sleeve warm, with the midges barely out, and couldn’t have been more beautiful.”"
The Joy Of Schadenfreude,www.theamericanconservative.com,Rod Dreher,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.theamericanconservative.com/dreher/the-joy-of-schadenfreude/,"Tweet ‘They had it coming,’ says Caitlin Flanagan. They sure did. ( NBC Today Show screengrab )
Schadenfreude is a great German word referring to the joy ( Freude ) taken at the damage ( Schaden ) sustained by others. It’s normally a low sentiment, but Caitlin Flanagan’s wonderful essay celebrating the justice of the rich college-scam parents getting busted puts the Freude in Schadenfreude . She was once a high-school guidance counselor who had to deal with monsters like these entitled creeps in the fancy Los Angeles school where she worked. Read on:
Sweet Christ, vindication!
How long has it been? Years? No, decades. If hope is the thing with feathers, I was a plucked bird. Long ago, I surrendered myself to the fact that the horrible, horrible private-school parents of Los Angeles would get away with their nastiness forever. But even before the molting, never in my wildest imaginings had I dared to dream that the arc of the moral universe could describe a 90-degree angle and smite down mine enemies with such a hammer fist of fire and fury that even I have had a moment of thinking, Could this be a bit too much?
Let’s back up.
More:
Much of the discussion of this scandal has centered on the corruption in the college-admissions process. But think about the kinds of jobs that the indicted parents held. Four of them worked in private equity, a fifth in the field of “investments,” others in real-estate development and the most senior management of huge corporations. Together, they have handled billions of dollars’ worth of assets within heavily regulated fields—yet look how easily and how eagerly they allegedly embrace a crooked scheme, as quoted in the court documents.
Here is Bill McGlashan, then a senior executive at a global private-equity fund, reacting to Singer’s plan to get his son (who does not play football) admitted to USC via the football team: “That’s just totally hilarious.”
Here is Robert Zangrillo, the founder and CEO of a private investment firm, talking with one of Singer’s employees who is planning to bring up his daughter’s grades by taking online classes in her name: “Just makes [sic] sure it gets done as quickly as possible.”
Here is John B. Wilson, the founder and CEO of a private-equity and real-estate-development firm, on getting his son into USC using a fake record of playing water polo: “Thanks again for making this happen!” And, “What are the options for the payment? Can we make it for consulting or whatever … so that I can pay it from the corporate account?” He can. “Awesome!”
Here is Douglas Hodge, the former CEO of a large investment-management company, learning from Singer that his son will be admitted to USC via a bribery scheme, and that it’s time to send a check: “Fanstatic [sic]!! Will do.”
One last savory morsel:
These parents—many of them avowed Trump haters—are furious that what once belonged to them has been taken away, and they are driven mad with the need to reclaim it for their children. The changed admissions landscape at the elite colleges is the aspect of American life that doesn’t feel right to them; it’s the lost thing, the arcadia that disappeared so slowly they didn’t even realize it was happening until it was gone. They can’t believe it—they truly can’t believe it—when they realize that even the colleges they had assumed would be their child’s back-up, emergency plan probably won’t accept them. They pay thousands and thousands of dollars for untimed testing and private counselors; they scour lists of board members at colleges, looking for any possible connections; they pay for enhancing summer programs that only underscore their children’s privilege. And—as poor whites did in the years leading up to 2016—they complain about it endlessly. At every parent coffee, silent auction, dinner party, Clippers game, book club, and wine tasting, someone is bitching about admissions. And some of these parents, it turns out, haven’t just been bitching; some of them decided to go MAGA.
And so it was that at 5:59 on the morning of March 12 in the sacramentally beautiful section of the Hollywood Hills called Outpost Estates, all was quiet, save for the sounds of the natural world. In the mid-century modern house of a beloved actress—a champion of progressive values, as is her husband—and two lovely daughters, everyone slept. But at the strike of 6:00, there was the kind of unholy pounding at the door that must have sounded more like an earthquake than a visitor: FBI agents, guns drawn, there to apprehend … Felicity Huffman? Felicity “Congress is attempting to eviscerate women’s health care. Like many women across America, I am outraged” Huffman? For the crime of … paying to get her daughter an extra 400 points on the SAT?
Down, down, down she went in the FBI car, in her handcuffs and athleisure, down below Outpost, down below Lake Hollywood, down below the Dolby Theatre where she had been so many times—in a beautiful gown, with her famous husband, William H. Macy, beside her—to watch the Academy Awards, once as a nominee. All the way down to—my God!—the downest place of all: Spring Street. The federal courthouse! This was where Donald Trump was supposed to go, not Felicity Huffman. Cool your heels, defender of the downtrodden: There is no rushing through all this—the mug shot, the phone call, the hearing. And this can’t even be grist for the mill of a new devotion to the plight of American mass incarceration. You’re now Exhibit A of law enforcement finally treating rich, white Americans as unsparingly as it treats poor, black ones.
Please, please, please read the whole thing. You have to treat yourself. The friend who sent me the link said that he and his wife were taking turns reading parts of it aloud to each other. It’s that good. Advertisement"

The Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) led by Raila Odinga on Friday lost two by-elections in Ugenya and Embakasi South.
Taking to Twitter, Deputy President William Rutoelbrates congratulated the winners; MDG’s David Ochieng and Julius Mawathe of Wiper.
The self-proclaimed hustler was keen to note that the hustler nation had decided to overlook the so-called big fish and instead went with the little known individuals.
“CONGRATULATIONS Ochieng (Ugenya) & Mawathe (Embakasi) for your God given victory. Jameni wacheni MUNGU aitwe MUNGU. The hustler nation has spoken, the people have decided. GLORY TO THE ALMIGHTY GOD,” the DP wrote. CONGRATULATIONS Ochieng (Ugenya) & Mawathe (Embakasi) for your God given victory. Jameni wacheni MUNGU aitwe MUNGU. The hustler nation has spoken, the people have decided. GLORY TO THE ALMIGHTY GOD.
— William Samoei Ruto, PhD (@WilliamsRuto) April 6, 2019
Also mocking the Raila led party was Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria who is keen on taking on the DP for the top seat come 2022.
Kuria condoled with Odinga who is yet to declare his interest in running for the presidency for the fifth time.
“I send my condolences to Baba for losing both at home in Ugenya and away in Embakasi South. From the foregoing it is clear that 2022 is an outright two horse dead heat between William Ruto and myself. I seek your support Baba,” he wrote on Facebook.
The outspoken lawmaker also slammed National Assembly Majority Leader Aden Duale for allegedly lying to the African Union envoy.
“Donning a Jubilee shirt on the very day we know Baba ataoshwa. And now in 3 weeks we are taking Wajir West. Aden Duale Mungu anawaona. Lying is a crime. Lying to an old man is an abomination,” he added.
Odinga and Ruto have been tearing at each other for a while now with the latter accusing the former of trying to tear apart the ruling Jubilee party.
Odinga on the other hand has asked the DP and his allies to stop politicizing the fight against graft.

The 4 Economic Indicators: March Nonfarm Employment,www.advisorperspectives.com,Doug Short,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.advisorperspectives.com/dshort/updates/2019/04/05/the-big-four-economic-indicators-march-nonfarm-employment,"By Jill Mislinski
Some of the Big Four indicators have still not been updated, but we thought it best to publish the latest on each, regardless of timing.
Official recession calls are the responsibility of the NBER Business Cycle Dating Committee, which is understandably vague about the specific indicators on which it bases its decisions. This committee statement is about as close as it gets to identifying its method.
There is, however, a general belief that there are four big indicators that the committee weighs heavily in its cycle identification process. They are:
Nonfarm Employment Industrial Production Real Retail Sales Real Personal Income (excluding Transfer Receipts) The Latest Indicator Data
This commentary has been updated to include this morning's release of Nonfarm Employment. March's 196K increase in total nonfarm payrolls had revisions that resulted in 14K more jobs than previously reported. The Investing.com consensus was for 175K new jobs and the unemployment rate to remain at 3.8%.
The chart below shows the monthly percent change in this indicator since the turn of the century, a period that includes two recessions. We've included a 12-month moving average to help visualize the trend.
The Problem of Revisions At first glance, this indicator appears to have a strong correlation with the business cycle. However, there is a major problem with this assumption: The data in this survey of business establishments undergo multiple revisions. The initial monthly estimate is subject to a first and second revision, subsequent benchmark revisions and annual revisions that stretch back many years (the most recent includes revisions back as far as February 1990). The cumulative size of the revisions is quite stunning, much of which is owing to the ""hindsight"" of those annual revisions.
The chart below measures the size of the revisions from the initial estimate to the latest employment report.
The Problem of Population Growth Another problem with the Nonfarm Employment data is that it isn't adjusted for population growth, which reduces its usefulness in illustrating secular trends. The chart below incorporates a population adjustment by dividing the Nonfarm Employment (FRED series PAYEMS) by the Civilian Labor Force Age 16 and Over (FRED series CLF16OV). We've added a couple of trend lines and a callout - not to suggest a forecast but rather to highlight the potential impact of a near-term business-cycle downturn. Note also that the current level is about where we were during the 2001 recession.
The Generic Big Four The chart and table below illustrate the performance of the generic Big Four with an overlay of a simple average of the four since the end of the Great Recession. The data points show the cumulative percent change from a zero starting point for June 2009.
Assessment and Outlook The US economy has been slow in recovering from the Great Recession, and the overall picture has been a mixed bag. Employment and Income have been relatively strong. Real Retail Sales have been rising but below trend. Industrial Production has been slow to recover and has finally been showing signs of improvement.
Here is a percent-off-high chart based on an average of the Big Four. The average of the four set a new all-time high in November, previously set in October.
Background Analysis The charts above don't show us the individual behavior of the Big Four leading up to the 2007 recession. To achieve that goal, we've plotted the same data using a ""percent off high"" technique. In other words, we show successive new highs as zero and the cumulative percent declines of months that aren't new highs. The advantage of this approach is that it helps us visualize declines more clearly and to compare the depth of declines for each indicator and across time (e.g., the short 2001 recession versus the Great Recession). Here is our four-pack showing the indicators with this technique.
Now let's examine the behavior of these indicators across time. The first chart below graphs the period from 2000 to the present, thereby showing us the behavior of the four indicators before and after the two most recent recessions. Rather than having four separate charts, we've created an overlay to help us evaluate the relative behavior of the indicators at the cycle peaks and troughs. (See the note below on recession boundaries).
The chart above is an excellent starting point for evaluating the relevance of the four indicators in the context of two very different recessions. In both cases, the bounce in Industrial Production matches the NBER trough while Employment and Personal Incomes lagged in their respective reversals.
As for the start of these two 21st century recessions, the indicator declines are less uniform in their behavior. We can see, however, that Employment and Personal Income were laggards in the declines.
Now let's look at the 1972-1985 period, which included three recessions - the savage 16-month Oil Embargo recession of 1973-1975 and the double dip of 1980 and 1981-1982 (6 months and 16 months, respectively).
And finally, for sharp-eyed readers who don't mind squinting at a lot of data, here's a cluttered chart from 1959 to the present. That is the earliest date for which all four indicators are available. The main lesson of this chart is the diverse patterns and volatility across time for these indicators. For example, retail sales and industrial production are far more volatile than employment and income.
The charts above focus on the Big Four individually, either separately or overlaid. Now let's take a quick look at an aggregate of the four. The next chart is an index created by equally weighting the four and indexing them to 100 for the January 1959 start date. We've used a log scale to give an accurate indication of growth and also added an exponential regression to assist us in seeing the secular patterns of faster and slower growth. As we can readily see, growth of this aggregate indicator has slowed dramatically since the end of the last recession.
Now let's plot the percent off high for this aggregate index. As we immediately recognize, it is completely worthless as a leading indicator of recessions. The aggregate index set a new high the month before the recession began for five of the eight recessions since the early 1960s.
We can construct a better leading indicator by plotting the average of the percent off highs for each of the four, which is the technique we've used in the next chart. Here we've highlighted the months when all four indicators were at all-time highs. The dashed line shows the -0.93% average of the four at recession starts.
The chart clearly illustrates the savagery of the last recession. It was much deeper than the closest contender in this time frame, the 1973-1975 Oil Embargo recession.
Appendix: Chart Gallery with Notes The indicator discussed in this article is illustrated below in three different data manipulations:
A log scale plotting of the complete data series to ensure that distances on the vertical axis reflect true relative growth. This adjustment is particularly important for data series that have changed significantly over time. A year-over-year representation to help, among other things, identify broader trends over the years. A percent-off-high manipulation, which is particularly useful for better understanding of trend behavior and secular volatility. Total Nonfarm Employees There are many ways to plot employment. The one referenced by the Federal Reserve researchers as one of the NBER indicators is Total Nonfarm Employees ( PAYEMS ).
A Note on Recessions : Recessions are represented as the peak month through the month preceding the trough to highlight the recessions in the charts above. For example, the NBER dates the last cycle peak as December 2007, the trough as June 2009 and a duration of 18 months. The ""Peak through the Period preceding the Trough"" series is the one FRED uses in its monthly charts, as explained in the FRED FAQs illustrated in this Industrial Production chart .

Everett Piper: Will Christian Business Owners Be Barred From Doing Business?,blackcommunitynews.com,Dr. Everett Piper,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://blackcommunitynews.com/everett-piper-will-christian-business-owners-be-barred-from-doing-business/,"Google +
If there was any remaining doubt, this past week’s news puts it to rest. Christians are now being punished in America.
From San Francisco, California to San Antonio, Texas, the church is being persecuted. Faithful Christians — those who still believe in the Bible as their rule of faith and practice — are being harassed for simply holding to the millennia-old creeds of their faith. Devout Catholics are being blackballed from our nation’s courts. Evangelicals are being excluded from the public debate. Today, orthodox Christians are not only considered politically unpopular, but they are now dubbed morally unacceptable to even engage in local commerce.
If you’re a Christian business owner who dares give money to a charitable cause grounded in traditional morality, your company will be targeted, protested and shut down. Your restaurant will be shuttered. Your bakery will be shunned. Your flower shop will be attacked. Faithful and devout Christians are now officially considered a cultural embarrassment. They are a pariah that must be removed from the market square. They cannot be tolerated. They must be barred. Under the rainbow banner of “inclusion,” Christians are now excluded from speaking, buying or selling in the arena of public life.
Proof?
On March 22, the San Antonio City Council announced with great pride and fanfare it was officially banning Chick-fil-A from doing business in the San Antonio International Airport over what it called the fast-food chain’s “anti-LGBTQ behavior.”
What was this egregious “behavior” you ask? Was it the refusal to do business with homosexuals? No. There has never been any such claim against Chick-fil-A. In fact, this company has been complimented repeatedly by the LGBTQ community for its gracious, kind and exemplary customer service. Was it a refusal to hire homosexuals? No. Again, there has never been such an accusation against this company and in fact Chick-fil-A does not ask about nor discriminate against any employee’s private sexual choices.
So, what did Chick-fil-A do that warranted the blacklisting of the San Antonio City Council?
Well, this company which is owned by evangelical Christians has dared to designate some of its annual charitable giving to churches and church related organizations that still believe in — can you believe it? — orthodox Christianity.
It is this shameful act that led San Antonio City Councilman Roberto Trevino, to breathlessly run to the microphone this past Friday to announce: “With this decision [to exclude faithful Christians], the City Council reaffirmed the work our city has done to become a champion of inclusion.” One has to wonder if Mr. Trevino even hears the sounds of that branch upon which he is sitting creaking and cracking as he saws away so feverishly while chanting his self-refuting mantra of not tolerating those he finds intolerable? A course or two in elementary Socratic logic might be in order here.
So, there you have it. We have actually come to a point in our culture where the state presumes the authority to tell a baker in Colorado what art he must create and a florist in Washington what religious ceremonies she must celebrate. Moreover, we now live in a time where your local City Council proudly denies a fast-food chain the right to buy, sell or do any business in the general economy simply because a Christian owner had the audacity to make private donations to the church.
Christians are now considered verboten. Show any evidence of believing in a biblical God and biblical morality and you will be shut down. You will be forbidden to sell your product. Your “intolerance” will not be tolerated. To paraphrase Mr. Trevino, “Oh, you Christians may have your precious ‘freedom of religion.’ Yes, the Constitution may protect your right to believe in your silly God and spew your old-fashioned ideas about sin and salvation. But if you dare say anything about any of this in the public square, or if you have the actual temerity to try to practice the tenets of your faith in your business or your public life, we will sue you, we will silence you, we will fine you, we will malign you, we will blackball you, we will de-platform you, we will not buy from you or sell to you. We will crush you. Submit or be destroyed.”
With deference to Martin Niemoller: First, they came for the evangelical and I said nothing because I wasn’t evangelical. Then they came for Catholics and I said nothing because I wasn’t Catholic. Then they came for the bakers, the florists and the Christian restaurateurs, and I said nothing because I was not a florist, a baker or a restauranteur. When they came for me, there was no one left to speak.
“And no one could buy or sell unless he has the mark ” Revelation 13:17
