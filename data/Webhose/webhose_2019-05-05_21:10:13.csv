"Note to Team Mueller: If you don’t indict, you can’t incite",www.therussophile.org,admin,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/note-to-team-mueller-if-you-dont-indict-you-cant-incite.html/,"This post was originally published on this site
I’ve covered the Justice Department for three decades, and seldom have I seen a story like the one published in The New York Times this week under the headline, “ Some on Mueller’s Team Say Report Was More Damaging Than Barr Revealed .”
What concerned me most is that the story’s anonymous allegations reflect a fundamental misunderstanding of the role prosecutors play, including special counsels such as Robert Mueller .
The job of prosecutors is not, as the Times headline suggested, to pen “damaging” narratives about people they couldn’t indict. And it’s not their job to air those people’s dirty laundry, or that of suspects outside of a grand jury room or a courtroom.
Mueller concluded there wasn’t evidence President Trump colluded with Russia to hijack the 2016 election, and therefore no indictment was warranted. And he punted on the question of obstruction, leaving his bosses — Attorney General William Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein — to determine that there wasn’t enough evidence to indict the president on that charge.
And, most significantly, there were no other people charged. That means Trump legally could not be named as an unindicted co-conspirator in an obstruction plot.
At that point, no federal prosecutor has the right to impugn an uncharged investigative target’s reputation through anonymous leaks or literary reports. They are not allowed to anonymously inject into the court of public opinion any “damaging” information about what they couldn’t succeed at offering in a court of law as proof of criminality.
Prosecution isn’t a game of horseshoes or hand grenades where prosecutors get to score points or inflict damage without indicting the target. In fact, the Founding Fathers built a legal system specifically to avoid the tarring of citizens when there wasn’t enough proof to meet a criminal charge. – READ MORE

"Why Comey, Clapper, and Brennan Aggressively Pushed RussiaGate Conspiracy Theories",www.therussophile.org,admin,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/why-comey-clapper-and-brennan-aggressively-pushed-russiagate-conspiracy-theories.html/,"This post was originally published on this site
Why did anonymous members of the intelligence community and top Obama administration officials like James Comey, James Clapper, and John Brennan so aggressively push the Russia collusion narrative for over two years in the midst of ongoing investigations? Who does that? Why have these Obama alumni been so conspicuously loud in their protestations against the president?
“They doth protest too much,” Monica Crowley explained in her Washington Times piece this week, as she fleshed out what many of us have been thinking from the beginning.
The best defense, the saying goes, is a good offense.
The key orchestrators of the Big Trump-Russia Collusion Lie seem to have hewed tightly to that tactical advice.
Over the past two years, one of their biggest “tells” has been their hyper-aggressive and gratuitous attacks on the president. Given that special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation found no collusion or obstruction of justice, their constant broadsides now look, in retrospect, like calculated pre-emptive strikes to deflect attention and culpability away from themselves.
By accusing Mr. Trump of what they themselves were guilty of, they created a masterful distraction through projection.
We now know that former FBI Director James Comey and his deputy, Andrew McCabe, are hip-deep in the conspiracy. Both wrote supposed “tell-all” books and carpet-bombed the media with interviews in which they regularly flung criminal accusations against the president. Whenever asked about their own roles, they reverted to denouncing Mr. Trump.
With Mr. Mueller’s findings, Mr. Comey’s and Mr. McCabe’s media benders look increasingly suspicious.
As do those of their comrades in the Obama national security apparatus, including former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and his partner in possible crime, former CIA Director John Brennan, who, apart from former President Barack Obama himself, may be the biggest player of them all. – READ MORE

Grassley: Mueller Team Mischaracterized Trump Campaign Emails In Court Filing,www.therussophile.org,admin,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/grassley-mueller-team-mischaracterized-trump-campaign-emails-in-court-filing.html/,"This post was originally published on this site
The special counsel’s office fed “speculation and innuendo” about possible collusion with Russia by withholding key details from emails cited in a court filing in the case of former Trump adviser George Papadopoulos, a top Republican senator alleged in a newly released letter.
“The public deserves to have the full context for the information the Special Counsel chooses to release. The glaring lack of it feeds speculation and innuendo that distorts the facts,” Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley wrote to special counsel Robert Mueller on Oct. 16, 2017.
Grassley, who then chaired the Senate Judiciary Committee, was responding to a “ statement of offense ” released in the case against Papadopoulos, the Trump campaign adviser who entered a plea deal in the special counsel’s probe on Oct. 5, 2017.
Prosecutors quoted from several emails in a way that suggested top Trump campaign officials were eager to meet with Russians. But Grassley asserted that the full emails showed that campaign officials rebuffed the idea of meeting with Russians. The Iowa Republican took Mueller’s team to task for failing to correct news reports that cited the Papadopoulos court filings as evidence of possible collusion with Russia.
“It should be the goal of anyone interested in an accurate portrayal of the facts for the American people to correct the erroneous reporting,” he wrote in the letter, which was published Thursday by Fox News.
Grassley’s letter to Mueller took on new significance in early April after members of the special counsel’s team began airing their frustrations over a letter that Attorney General William Barr sent Congress regarding the findings of the Mueller probe.
Barr said in a letter to lawmakers on March 24 that prosecutors were unable to establish that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia. He also said that Mueller declined to make a decision on whether obstruction of justice charges could be brought against Trump.
The New York Times and Washington Post reported that anonymous Mueller prosecutors have expressed frustration that the Barr letter mischaracterized their findings on the obstruction component of the investigation.
The Times and Post articles did not identify which Mueller team members have raised concerns about the Barr letter.
Grassley sent a letter to Barr on March 8 asking the attorney general to look into the special counsel’s “selective use” of emails in the Papadopoulos “statement of offense.”
The full October 2017 letter to Mueller was not made public until Fox News published it on Thursday.
In the letter to Mueller, Grassley pointed to two sections of the Papadopoulos “statement of offense” that quoted from emails sent on May 4, 2016 and Aug. 15, 2016.
In the May 4 email, Papadopoulos wrote to others on the Trump campaign that Russia “has been eager to meet Mr. Trump for quite sometime and have been reaching out to me to discuss.”
Mueller’s team quoted from an email response from Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who wrote: “We need someone to communicate that DT is not doing these trips. It should be someone low level in the campaign so as not to send any signal.”
Numerous news outlets reported that the passage showed that Manafort wanted a low-level campaign adviser to meet with Russians. But Grassley said that other emails sent by Manafort’s deputy, Rick Gates, show that he was asserting that a low-level adviser should be the person to reject requests to meet with Russians.
“Agree. What if I get our correspondence coordinator to do it. This is the person responding to all mail of non-importance. It would be a general letter,” Gates wrote.
Manafort replied: “good.”
Grassley also faulted Mueller’s team for misrepresenting email exchanges involving Sam Clovis, another Trump campaign official.
The statement of offense quoted from an Aug. 15, 2016 email in which a campaign supervisor, later identified as Clovis, told Papadopoulos that “I would encourage you” to “make the trip, if it is feasible.”
But Grassley said the rest of the email makes clear that Papadopoulos asked Clovis to join him on conversations with representatives from several foreign governments, including “the UK, Greek, Italian and even Russian government.”
Clovis declined the invitation and wrote in other emails that any potential meetings with Russians would have to follow meetings first with Western allies.
“My thought is that we probably should not go forward with any meetings with the Russians until we have had occasion to sit with our NATO allies, especially France, Germany and Great Britain,” wrote Clovis. “We need to reassure our allies that we are not going to advance anything with Russia until we have everyone on the same page.”
Grassley also suggested that Mueller’s inaccurate statement led Clovis to withdraw his name from consideration to a top Department of Agriculture post."
Cambridge Academic Reflects On Interactions With ‘Spygate’ Figure,www.therussophile.org,admin,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/cambridge-academic-reflects-on-interactions-with-spygate-figure.html/,"This post was originally published on this site
Svetlana Lokhova did not get along with Stefan Halper, which is what she says made a dinner invitation to the Cambridge University professor’s home in January 2016 all the more peculiar.
“Halper was a lurking presence with a horrible aura — I avoided him,” said Lokhova, a Cambridge post-graduate student who studies Soviet-era espionage.
Lokhova dodged the invitation to Halper’s home, which she said was sent to her by Christopher Andrew, a Cambridge professor and official historian for MI5, the British domestic intelligence service. But the past three years have revealed new details about Halper and other activities that went on at Cambridge that have caused Lokhova to question why she was asked to that dinner at Halper’s.
For one, a series of stories that appeared in the press in early 2017 heavily implied Lokhova was a Russian agent who tried to suborn Michael Flynn at a dinner hosted at Cambridge on Feb. 28, 2014. Flynn served at the time as director of the Defense Intelligence Agency.
A year after those stories appeared, The Daily Caller News Foundation reported Halper cozied to three Trump campaign advisers , Carter Page, Sam Clovis and George Papadopoulos. In May 2018, Halper was revealed as a longtime CIA and FBI informant, a revelation that led President Donald Trump to accuse the FBI of planting a spy in his campaign. The Republican coined the term “Spygate” to describe the alleged scandal.
After Halper’s links to American intelligence were revealed, The New York Times and The Washington Post reported he and another Cambridge luminary, former MI6 chief Richard Dearlove, raised concerns about Lokhova’s contacts with Flynn that were subsequently passed to American and British intelligence.
Lokhova blames Halper for distorting her brief interaction with Flynn into “an international espionage scandal” in which she wound up as collateral damage.
“What Halper staged is a textbook ‘black-op’ to dirty up the reputation of a political opponent. He needed an innocuous social event to place Flynn in a room with a woman who was ethnically Russian. I was unlucky he picked me,” Lokhova told TheDCNF.
Lokhova, a dual Russian and British citizen, has spoken out before about Halper and the allegations about her in the media. She accused Halper of making “false” and “absurd” claims about her in 2018 interviews with TheDCNF . She has also taken to Twitter to criticize reporters who published allegations about her and Flynn.
The Guardian’s Luke Harding is one target of Lokhova’s ire. She has criticized the British reporter for a March 31, 2017, story that contained thinly veiled allegations she tried to compromise Flynn.
According to the report, which was based on anonymous sources, American and British intelligence developed concerns about Lokhova’s interactions with Flynn at the February 2014 dinner, which was hosted by the Cambridge Intelligence Seminar. Halper, Dearlove and Andrew are co-conveners of the seminar, which hosts events for current and former spies.
The Wall Street Journal also published an innuendo-laden story March 18, 2017, about Flynn and Lokhova. The hook for the story was that Flynn had failed to report his contact with Lokhova to the Defense Intelligence Agency.
Lokhova, who has lived in the U.K. since 1998, vehemently denies the insinuations in the articles that she is a Russian agent or that she tried to seduce Flynn. She has provided emails and photographs to TheDCNF to help back up her case. She also notes that all of the allegations about her have been made anonymously.
Dan O’Brien, a Defense Intelligence Agency official who accompanied Flynn to the Cambridge event, told TheWSJ he saw nothing untoward involving Lokhova. Lokhova’s partner, David North, has told TheDCNF he picked Lokhova up after the event.
Since learning more about Halper, Lokhova has reflected back on the few interactions she had with him over the years at Cambridge.
A veteran of three Republican administrations, Halper joined Cambridge in 2001. From his perch at the stories university, Halper wrote books about American politics and the geopolitical threat that China poses to the West. He also received over $1 million in contracts from the Pentagon’s Office of Net Assessment to write studies on Russia, China and Afghanistan.
Lokhova says she first remembers seeing Halper in November 2013, when she gave a talk about her research on Soviet-era spy archives. The pair had few direct interactions over the next several years, even though they attended the same academic seminars. Lokhova recalls one interaction in 2014 or 2015 when Halper sat down at a table with her and North.
“The guy looks at us like we’re completely horrible people, and then gets up and sits across the room.”
Lokhova also said she learned from a Cambridge faculty member that Halper was spreading rumors that she was linked to Russian intelligence.
On March 25, 2018, TheDCNF reported on Halper’s contacts with the Trump campaign.
Halper, whose late father-in-law was legendary CIA official Ray Cline, made contact with Page at a political forum hosted at Cambridge on July 11, 2016, nearly three weeks before the FBI opened its investigation of the Trump campaign. Page attended the event after receiving an invitation in June 2016 from a Ph.D. student who studied under Halper.
Halper reached out to Papdopoulos in September 2016, and offered the young Trump aide $3,000 and a trip to London to write a policy paper on energy issues.
Two months after TheDCNF report, the Times and Post identified Halper as a longtime FBI and CIA informant sent to gather intelligence on the Trump campaign. The newspapers also reported Halper was one of those at Cambridge who had expressed concerns about Lokhova’s interaction with Flynn.
The Times reported May 18, 2018, that Halper “was alarmed by the general’s apparent closeness with a Russian woman who was also in attendance.”
“The concern was strong enough that it prompted another person to pass on a warning to the American authorities that Mr. Flynn could be compromised by Russian intelligence, according to two people familiar with the matter.”
The Post reported June 5, 2018, that Halper and Dearlove were “disconcerted” by Flynn and Lokhova’s interactions in 2014. Those concerns were provided to American and British intelligence, though it is unclear if Halper and Dearlove were direct sources for the government agencies. Dearlove met prior to the 2016 U.S. election with Christopher Steele, the former MI6 officer who authored the infamous anti-Trump dossier alleging a “well-developed conspiracy” between the Trump campaign and Kremlin.
***
Christopher Andrew’s Jan. 12, 2016, dinner invitation sticks out in Lokhova’s mind not just because of its randomness —“it came out of the blue,” she says — but also because of all of the other events that unfolded at that time.
Lokhova says Christopher Andrew emailed her asking her to keep Feb. 13 and Feb. 20, 2016, open on her calendar to attend a dinner for Halper’s wife.
Lokhova, who wrote her dissertation under Andrew’s direction, says she was caught off guard by the invitation, both because she had barely spoken to Halper and because she did not know Halper’s wife.
Lokhova has no proof that she was being lured to meet with Halper in order to gather dirt on Flynn, but she is now suspicious because of the timing of the invite.
In December 2015, a month before the invitation, Flynn attended a gala hosted by RT, the Russia-owned news agency. The Moscow visit is often cited as evidence of Flynn’s too-close links to Moscow. Flynn joined the Trump campaign as an informal adviser in February 2016.
***
The allegations about Flynn and Lokhova came out of nowhere.
In an essay at the London Times on Feb. 19, 2017, Christopher Andrew wrote of the “impulsive” former national security adviser he had met for the first time three years earlier.
Andrew’s essay was a response to Flynn’s firing as national security adviser. Flynn, a retired lieutenant general, was forced to resign Feb. 14, 2017, after allegedly lying to the White House about his contacts in December 2016 with then-Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Flynn would later plead guilty to lying to the FBI about those contacts.
Lokhova says she was taken aback by Andrew’s article. For one, Andrew had not told her that he would be writing the article even though they were in frequent contact. At the time, Lokhova and Andrew were working together on a book based on Lokhova’s research of Soviet intelligence archives. Andrew’s piece also contained clear sexual undertones, including the suggestion that a Russian student (Lokhova) had “charmed” Flynn.
Reporters came out of the woodworks following Andrew’s story, says Lokhova.
Emails seen by TheDCNF show she was contacted by Washington Post columnist David Ignatius, who said he had been in contact with Andrew and wanted to speak to her during his planned visit to Cambridge. Ignatius would write a column May 22, 2018, defending Halper after he was outed as a government informant. A source familiar with Halper’s contacts with the Trump campaign has told TheDCNF he suggested the Trump campaign establish a relationship with Ignatius, who did not publish a story on Lokhova.
The Times also contacted Lokhova to inquire about Flynn, but the newspaper did not run a story about her or Flynn.
TheWSJ and Guardian , however, did publish articles.
Both reports, published in March 2017, suggested Flynn had failed to report his encounter with Lokhova to the Defense Intelligence Agency. But the real meat of the story was that U.S. intelligence officials had “serious concerns” about Flynn’s interaction with Lokhova.
The reports do not say whether those concerns were raised in 2014 or years later, but the timeline is important.
If Halper was concerned about Lokhova as early as 2014, why was she invited to his home two years later for dinner? Lokhova speculates that Halper intended to do what he did with Page and Papadopoulos. But if Halper waited until 2016 or later to raise concerns, was he truly worried about her contacts with Flynn?
As for the core allegations of the 2014 Cambridge event, Lokhova calls them “preposterous.”
She points to an email Andrew sent her April 19, 2017, to say he had told a Guardian reporter she was not a Russian asset.
“This material is quite sufficient to dispose of conspiracy theories about SL somehow serving some Russian interest,” Andrew wrote Lokhova in the email, which she provided to TheDCNF.
Lokhova notes the dinner Flynn attended was a small event and that all of the attendees had been vetted by DIA. Photos Lokhova provided to TheDCNF show she did not sit next to Flynn at the dinner, as the Journal’s sources claimed. Lokhova says she interacted with Flynn, but that others, including Dearlove and Andrew were close by. And though Lokhova was the only Russian at the dinner, most others Flynn met with were non-American. No stories were published suggesting that he had failed to report his contacts with a group made up largely of Brits.
Lokhova has also provided TheDCNF an email which showed she was invited by Cambridge officials to meet with Flynn’s predecessor, Gen. Vincent Stewart, on May 1, 2015. If Lokhova was a threat to Flynn, why would she not have been a threat to his successor, she wonders.
Andrew, Dearlove and Halper have avoided comment. Cambridge reportedly instructed faculty to avoid discussing the topic because of its sensitive nature."
German MP: Time for NATO to retire – 'security risk & lawbreaker',www.therussophile.org,Ashley Bailey,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/german-mp-time-for-nato-to-retire-security-risk.html/,"This post was originally published on this site

German lawmaker Alexander Neu lambasted NATO for conducting aggressive wars and raking up defense spending, suggesting Germany should quit its military command, and the bloc be dissolved altogether .
NATO’s 70th birthday is “not a reason to celebrate, but rather an occasion to finally rethink it, before it’s too late,” Neu wrote in Die Freiheitsliebe blog on Thursday.
The lawmaker from the opposition Left Party slammed the US-led military bloc as an organization that poses “significant security risk to the world” and “systematically violates international law.”
NATO revealed its true colors when it waged an “aggressive war” against Yugoslavia without the UN’s approval, and carried out numerous interventions, which claimed the lives of “countless victims,” Neu argued.
He pointed out that last year NATO’s member states spent more than $1 trillion on defense, which is far more than the defense budgets of its rivals, China and Russia, combined .
The imperialist competition and the fear of losing economic and ideological supremacy drive NATO towards more rearmament and confrontation.
In order to avoid global escalation, the lawmaker proposed that Germany should leave the alliance’s “military structures,” and then NATO itself should be dissolved and replaced by a new “collective security system,” which would include Russia.
Berlin’s contribution to NATO has caused a rift with Washington in recent years, as President Donald Trump repeatedly accused Germany, along with other EU nations, of not spending its “fair share” on the bloc’s collective security. German officials rebuked the criticism, but admitted the country won’t reach NATO’s spending target until 2024.
Founded in 1949, NATO was primarily seen as a bulwark against the Soviet Bloc during the Cold War. The alliance continued its existence after the Soviet Union collapsed, and expanded eastwards, despite vehement protests from Moscow.

Russia ‘not backing Haftar’s Tripoli offensive’,www.therussophile.org,Michael Sullivan,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/russia-not-backing-haftars-tripoli-offensive.html/,"This post was originally published on this site

Russia says it has not assisted forces loyal to Libyan strongman Khalifa Haftar in their latest push to take over Tripoli, calling for a political solution to the recent flare-up of tensions in Libya.
Asked if Russia was backing Haftar’s new offensive on the Libyan capital, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Friday that Russia was not involved.
Haftar on Thursday announced that his forces would begin an offensive against Tripoli, which is currently controlled by the county’s internationally-recognized government. The so-called Libyan National Army (LNA), under Haftar’s command, claimed that its advance on the country’s west was meant to root out what it called “terrorist groups” in the restive region.
Peskov said Moscow was monitoring the developments.
“We are closely following the situation in Libya,” the Kremlin spokesman said. “Of course we consider that the most important thing is that (military) operations there do not lead to bloodshed. The situation should be resolved peacefully.”
UN chief meets Haftar in Benghazi
Amid the escalation, United Nations (UN) Secretary-General Antonio Guterres met Haftar in the eastern city of Benghazi on Friday, witnesses said.
Guterres, who had been in the Libyan capital this week to help organize a national reconciliation conference slated for later this month, reportedly also met Aguila Saleh, the speaker of the eastern-based parliament, in the city of Tobruk earlier on Friday.
The UN chief left Libya after the meetings, with “a heavy heart and deeply concerned,” he said on Twitter, adding, “I still hope it is possible to avoid a bloody confrontation in and around Tripoli.” I leave Libya with a heavy heart and deeply concerned. I still hope it is possible to avoid a bloody confrontation in and around Tripoli.
The UN is committed to facilitating a political solution and, whatever happens, the UN is committed to supporting the Libyan people.
— António Guterres (@antonioguterres) April 5, 2019
Haftar’s forces, however, continued their advance on the capital on Friday, capturing the village of Suq al-Khamis, some 40 kilometers south of Tripoli, a resident and an eastern military source said. The capture came after clashes with forces allied to the UN-backed Tripoli government, the sources said.
On Thursday, LNA forces seized Gharyan, about 80 kilometers south of Tripoli after skirmishes with forces allied to the Tripoli-based government. But they were driven from a checkpoint less than 30 kilometers from Tripoli early on Friday.
Tripoli’s forces captured 145 LNA fighters in Zawiya, west of Tripoli, a western commander, Mohamed Alhudair, told Reuters on Friday, adding that 60 of their vehicles had also been confiscated.
An LNA source said 128 forces had been captured.
Libya has been the scene of increasing violence since 2011, when former dictator Muammar Gaddafi was toppled from power after an uprising and a NATO military intervention. His ouster created a huge power vacuum, leading to chaos and the emergence of numerous militant outfits, including the Takfiri Daesh terrorist group.
The oil-rich country is now divided between two rival governments — the House of Representatives, based in the eastern city of Tobruk, and the internationally-recognized government of Fayez al-Sarraj, or the Tripoli-based Government of National Accord (GNA).
Haftar and the LNA have been backed by certain Arab governments, including the United Arab Emirates and Libya’s neighbor Egypt, and governments in Europe that once contributed to the NATO military operation to oust Gaddafi have also offered Haftar some diplomatic support.

A number of other countries have established partnership agreements with NATO. Israel is a de facto member of NATO, based on an agreement reached in 2003. In turn, the US has established a host of military alliances on a regional basis.
Source: NATO
Under the semblance of a multi-national military alliance, the Pentagon dominates NATO decision-making. The US controls NATO command structures, which are embedded into those of the US. The Supreme Allied Commander Europ e (SACEUR) as well as the Supreme Allied Commander Atlantic (SACLANT) are Americans appointed by Washington. NATO current Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg is essentially a bureaucrat. He does not call the shots.
Two other key command structures Allied Command Transformation (ACT) and Allied Command Operations (ACO), “responsible for the planning and execution of all NATO military operations” were added in 2002.
Under the terms of the military alliance, NATO member states are harnessed into endorsing Washington’s imperial design of World conquest under the doctrine of collective security.
In 1949, NATO became a Cold War instrument which prevented and undermined the development of trade, political, social and cultural relations between Western Europe and the Soviet block including Eastern Europe.
For Washington, with the Pentagon pulling the strings, NATO has become a convenient military “multi-state proxy”.
The strategic objectives of the US with regard to NATO are: The de facto US Military Occupation of Western, Eastern Europe and Canada through the establishment of US military bases in most NATO member states The imposition of US Foreign Policy , requiring the acceptance (under the doctrine of collective security) of all US war plans by NATO member states (including military deployments on Russia’s doorstep) A mechanism whereby t he Pentagon finances its wars and military operations through contributions by each NATO member state, at tax-payers expense; The conduct of US-led wars under the emblem of the NATO military alliance, thereby obliging NATO member states to deploy their military capabilities as well as “do the dirty work for us”, i.e. killing and destruction on behalf of Washington. The extension of US influence in the post war period into the former colonies of Western European countries (France, Belgium, Italy, Britain)
Military Occupation is tagged as “Protection” and the governments of NATO member states are actually “Paying the U.S. to Occupy their countries”. It is all for a good cause. “Make the World Safer”:
“The biggest indignity yet was the ludicrous demand that NATO allies pay to host the American troops permanently garrisoned there – to essentially bankroll their own occupations. Last week, it was reported the US would begin asking some of its most hospitable allies – those nations home to hundreds of thousands of soldiers – to foot the bill for the cost of keeping them “safe.”(H. Busyinsi,
I should mention that in addition to recommending NATO for the Nobel Peace Prize, the media relentlessly presents NATO as an instrument of peace-making. US Military Bases and Global Military Alliances
The Pentagon’s grip extends well beyond the 29 NATO member states. It also includes partner countries as well as a broad system of military alliances in all major regions of the World including Latin America, North Africa and the Middle East, sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, South East Asia, East Asia (Japan, South Korea) and Oceania. Israel is a de facto NATO member state.
Military alliances and military occupation go hand in hand.
More generally the creation of military alliances has become a means to install US military bases in a large number of countries, including countries which were the victims of US led wars and military interventions. (eg Vietnam, Cambodia, Indonesia, Afghanistan, Iraq)
With the exception of NATO Strategic Command and its Logistics bases, there are no NATO military bases.
There are US bases located in host countries (including NATO member states) as well as national military bases under the jurisdiction of the NATO member states, often in a joint arrangement with the US.
Today there are approximately 39 US military bases in Germany (based on official sources), many of which are under a system of joint command with Germany and NATO.
In Italy, the major military bases are: Aviano Air Base, Pordenone San Vito Dei Normanni Air Station, near Brindisi Naval Air Station Sigonella, near Catania, Sicily Camp Darby, near Pisa and Livorno
According to an unconfirmed source, In Italy, there are about 100 US military bases and facilities
Cross-Cutting Coalitions: Sleeping with the Enemy
Of significance, beyond the scope of this article, are the broad structures of military alliances of Russia and China under the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO).
Turkey (a member of NATO) is now collaborating with Russia as well as Iran. America’s staunchest ally Pakistan is now a full member of the SCO and is actively collaborating with China. Geographic Combat Commands. US Military Bases Worldwide
America’s System of Geographic Combat Commands was established in the wake of World War II. It constitutes the foundations of global warfare, leading to the deployment of US Air, Navy and Land forces Worldwide, including the militarization of outer space and the deployment of nuclear weapons. In turn, all major theater wars are coordinated by US Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) at Offutt Air Force Base, Nebraska,
The United States currently has more than 800 formal military bases in 80 countries. In turn, US-led military and economic alliances have played a key role in extending America’s sphere of influence. Once these military bases are established in countries, they remain. The host country becomes a de facto ally of the US.
From a strategic point of view with modern day warfare, the geographic combat commands are in some regards obsolete. They are largely geared towards controlling countries which host US military bases. They do not constitute an effective structure for waging strategic military operations against Russia or China.
800+ US Military Bases. Where are they Located
Joint Forces command agreements are signed between the US and its allies. The host countries must not only endorse US military doctrine, they also contribute sizeable financial resources which are used to fund US military operations. In this regard, NATO member states contribute financially to sustaining the US-led military apparatus.
The map below is incomplete. It does not include US bases under Joint Command
America’s allies are also caught in the nexus of sustaining the US weapons industry (“defense contractors”) through multibillion dollar purchase. Nuclear War and Nuclear Weapons “The Privatization of Nuclear War”

US-NATO interventions are presented as peacemaking endeavors. A new generation of “more usable”“low yield” nuclear weapons are categorized as “harmless to civilians”. This initiative was first formulated during the George W. Bush administration. The concepts are contained in the 2001 Nuclear Posture Review, adopted by the Senate in 2002.
Hiroshima Day 2003: Secret Meeting at Strategic Command Headquarters
On August 6, 2003, on Hiroshima Day, commemorating when the first atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima (August 6 1945), a secret meeting was held behind closed doors at Strategic Command Headquarters at the Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska.
Senior executives from the nuclear industry and the military industrial complex were in attendance. This mingling of defense contractors, scientists and policy-makers was not intended to commemorate Hiroshima. The meeting was intended to set the stage for the development of a new generation of “smaller”, “safer” and “more usable” nuclear weapons, to be used in the “in-theater nuclear wars” of the 21st Century.
In a cruel irony, the participants to this secret meeting, which excluded members of Congress, arrived on the anniversary of the Hiroshima bombing and departed on the anniversary of the attack on Nagasaki. More than 150 military contractors, scientists from the weapons labs, and other government officials gathered at the headquarters of the US Strategic Command in Omaha, Nebraska to plot and plan for the possibility of “full-scale nuclear war”, calling for the production of a new generation of nuclear weapons – more “usable” so-called “mini-nukes” and earth penetrating “bunker busters” armed with atomic warheads.
According to a leaked draft of the agenda, the secret meeting included discussions on “mini-nukes” and “bunker-buster” bombs with nuclear war heads “for possible use against rogue states”:
Participants intimated:
“We need to change our nuclear strategy from the Cold War to one that can deal with emerging threats… The meeting will give some thought to how we guarantee the efficacy of the (nuclear) stockpile.”
The post 9/11 nuclear weapons doctrine was in the making, with America’s major defense contractors directly involved in the decision-making process.
The Hiroshima Day 2003 meetings had set the stage for the “privatization of nuclear war”. Corporations not only reap multibillion-dollar profits from the production of nuclear bombs, they also have a direct voice in setting the agenda regarding the use and deployment of nuclear weapons.
The nuclear weapons industry, which includes the production of nuclear devices as well as the missile delivery systems, etc., is controlled by a handful of defense contractors with Lockheed Martin, General Dynamics, Northrop Grunman, Raytheon and Boeing in the lead. It is worth noting that barely a week prior to the historic August 6, 2003 meeting, the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) disbanded its advisory committee which provided an “independent oversight” on the US nuclear arsenal, including the testing and/or use of new nuclear devices. (The above text is an excerpt from Michel Chossudovsky’s Towards a World War Three Scenario, The Dangers of Nuclear War. Global Research, Montreal, 2011)
Dangerous Crossroads: The Future of Humanity is Threatened
Needless to say, the World is at a dangerous crossroads. The future of humanity is threatened. Lies and fabrications permeate US-NATO military doctrine. Those who decide believe in their own propaganda. Not only do they believe that tactical nuclear weapons are peace-making bombs, they are now putting forth the concept of a “Winnable Third World War”. Taking out China and Russia is on the drawing board of the Pentagon.
We are at the juncture of the most serious crisis in World history. A Third World War using nuclear weapons is terminal. This is not an understatement.
Military interventions are not limited to conventional warfare. What is at stake is a process of global warfare using advanced weapons systems. The safeguards of the Cold War era have been scrapped. The concept of “Mutually Assured Destruction” pertaining to the use of nuclear weapons has been replaced by the doctrine of preemptive nuclear war.
The INF Treaty is defunct. Nuclear weapons are portrayed by the media as peace-making bombs. They are no longer tagged as Weapons of Mass Destruction. They are to be used in what the Pentagon calls “bloody nose” operations.
In the 2001 Nuclear Posture Review (NPR) under the Bush administration, the Pentagon introduced the notion of pre-emptive nuclear war, namely the use of nuclear weapons on a first strike basis as a means of “self defense”.
The new generation of so-called tactical nuclear weapons (mininukes) has been been categorized as “low yield” and “more usable. The US Senate in 2002 approved their use in the conventional war theater. They are contemplated for use against North Korea and Iran.
They are tagged as “safe to the surrounding civilian population because the explosion is underground.” These “low yield” tactical nuclear bombs have an explosive capacity between one third and twelve times a Hiroshima bomb.
“More Usable”“Low Yield Nuclear Weapons Deployed in Five Non-Nuclear Weapons States: Germany, Italy, Belgium,The Netherlands, Turkey
The “Official” Nuclear Weapons States
Five countries, the US, UK, France, China and Russia are considered to be “nuclear weapons states” (NWS), “an internationally recognized status conferred by the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT)”. Three other “Non NPT countries” (i.e. non-signatory states of the NPT) including India, Pakistan and North Korea, have recognized possessing nuclear weapons.
It is worth noting that North Korea was the only declared nuclear weapons state which voted YES at the UN General Assembly, in favor of the prohibition of nuclear weapons under Resolution L.41.
Nobody knows about this. WHY: Because the mainstream media has not mentioned it (“Fake News” through Omission) or as in the case of The Guardian and Bloomberg, the DPRK was casually lumped together with the other nuclear weapons states which voted NO (against the resolution).
“Oops News”. “We made a mistake”. We did not really check the UN General Assembly documents.
Israel: “Undeclared Nuclear State”
Israel is identified as an “undeclared nuclear state”. It produces and deploys nuclear warheads directed against military and civilian targets in the Middle East including Tehran.
Belgium, Germany, The Netherlands, Italy and Turkey: erroneously categorised as Non-Nuclear Weapons States”
The nuclear weapons capabilities of these five countries including delivery procedures are formally acknowledged. The US has supplied some 480 B61. thermonuclear bombs to five so-called “non-nuclear states”, including Belgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Turkey. In recent developments the B61.11 mini-nukes are to replaced by the recently developed B61.12. Based on 2014 data Italy possesses 50 B61 tactical nuclear weapons at its Aviano base. It is unclear whether these bombs are under US or National Command.
Casually disregarded by the Vienna based UN Nuclear Watchdog (IAEA), the US has actively contributed to the proliferation of nuclear weapons in Western Europe. As part of this European stockpiling, Turkey, which is a partner of the US-led coalition against Iran along with Israel, possesses some 90 thermonuclear B61 bunker buster bombs at the Incirlik nuclear air base. ( National Resources Defense Council, Nuclear Weapons in Europe , February 2005) By the recognised definition, these five countries are “undeclared nuclear weapons states”.
The stockpiling and deployment of tactical B61 in these five “non-nuclear states” are intended for targets in the Middle East. Moreover, in accordance with “NATO strike plans”, these thermonuclear B61 bunker buster bombs (stockpiled by the “non-nuclear States”) could be launched “against targets in Russia or countries in the Middle East such as Syria and Iran” ( quoted in National Resources Defense Council, Nuclear Weapons in Europe , February 2005)
C lick to See Details and Map of Nuclear Facilities located in 5 European “Non-Nuclear States”
The stockpiled weapons are B61 thermonuclear bombs. All the weapons are gravity bombs of the B61-3, -4, and -10 types.2 . Those estimates were based on private and public statements by a number of government sources and assumptions about the weapon storage capacity at each base .( National Resources Defense Council, Nuclear Weapons in Europe , February 2005)
Germany: Nuclear Weapons Producer
Among the five “undeclared nuclear states”, “Germany remains the most heavily nuclearized country with three nuclear bases (two of which are fully operational) and may store as many as 150 [B61 bunker buster ] bombs” (Ibid). In accordance with “NATO strike plans” (mentioned above) these tactical nuclear weapons are also targeted at the Middle East. While Germany is not categorized officially as a nuclear power, it produces nuclear warheads for the French Navy. It stockpiles nuclear warheads (made in America) and it has the capabilities of delivering nuclear weapons.
Moreover, The European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company – EADS , a Franco-German-Spanish joint venture, controlled by Deutsche Aerospace and the powerful Daimler Group is Europe’s second largest military producer, supplying .France’s M51 nuclear missile. Germany imports and deploys nuclear weapons from the US. It also produces nuclear warheads which are exported to France. Yet it is classified as a non-nuclear state. Fidel’s Message on the Dangers of Nuclear War
In 2010, October 12 to 15, 2010, I had extensive and detailed discussions with Fidel Castro in Havana, pertaining to the dangers of nuclear war, the global economic crisis and the nature of the New World Order.
Fidel Castor and Michel Chossudovsky, October 2010
These meetings resulted in a wide-ranging and fruitful interview which was subsequently published by Global Research.
Recorded on the last day of the Conversations, October 15, 2010, Fidel Castro made the following statement:
In a nuclear war the “collateral damage” would be the life of all humanity.
Let us have the courage to proclaim that all nuclear or conventional weapons, everything that is used to make war, must disappear!
[embedded content]
“The use of nuclear weapons in a new war would mean the end of humanity. This was candidly foreseen by scientist Albert Einstein who was able to measure their destructive capability to generate millions of degrees of heat, which would vaporize everything within a wide radius of action. This brilliant researcher had promoted the development of this weapon so that it would not become available to the genocidal Nazi regime.
Each and every government in the world has the obligation to respect the right to life of each and every nation and of the totality of all the peoples on the planet.
Today there is an imminent risk of war with the use of that kind of weapon and I don’t harbour the least doubt that an attack by the United States and Israel against the Islamic Republic of Iran would inevitably evolve towards a global nuclear conflict.
The World’s peoples have an obligation to demand of their political leaders their Right to Live. When the life of humankind, of your people and your most beloved human beings run such a risk, nobody can afford to be indifferent; not one minute can be lost in demanding respect for that right; tomorrow will be too late.
Albert Einstein himself stated unmistakably: “I do not know with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones”. We fully comprehend what he wanted to convey, and he was absolutely right, yet in the wake of a global nuclear war, there wouldn’t be anybody around to make use of those sticks and stones.
There would be “collateral damage”, as the American political and military leaders always affirm, to justify the deaths of innocent people.
In a nuclear war the “collateral damage” would be the life of all humanity.
Let us have the courage to proclaim that all nuclear or conventional weapons, everything that is used to make war, must disappear!”
Fidel Castro Ruz, October 15, 2010 Flashback: The Unspoken History of Nuclear War
The Manhattan Project established in 1939 together with Britain and Canada developed the first atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. What was the purpose of the Manhattan Project? The official explanation is that it was America’s response to Nazi Germany’s intent to develop the atomic bomb. Bear in mind, the Manhattan project was launched in 1939, two years prior to America’s participation in World War II.
What is never mentioned in the history of nuclear weapons is that the Manhattan Project had formulated a plan to use nuclear weapons against the Soviet Union as early as 1942. In other words, the Nuclear Arms Race was not the product of the Cold War. It took it roots during World War II when the US and the Soviet Union were allies. And present US military doctrine is largely a continuation of the nuclear weapons program initiated under the Manhattan Project:
According to a secret document dated September 15, 1945, “ the Pentagon had envisaged blowing up the Soviet Union with a coordinated nuclear attack directed against major urban areas.
All major cities of the Soviet Union were included in the list of 66 “strategic” targets. The tables below categorize each city in terms of area in square miles and the corresponding number of atomic bombs required to annihilate and kill the inhabitants of selected urban areas.
Six atomic bombs were to be used to destroy each of the larger cities including Moscow, Leningrad, Tashkent, Kiev, Kharkov, Odessa.
The Pentagon estimated that a total of 204 atomic bombs would be required to “Wipe the Soviet Union off the Map” . The targets for a nuclear attack consisted of sixty-six major cities.
To undertake this operation the “optimum” number of bombs required was of the order of 466 (see document below)
One single atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima resulted in the immediate death of 100,000 people in the first seven seconds. Imagine what would have happened if 204 atomic bombs had been dropped on major cities of the Soviet Union as outlined in a secret U.S. plan formulated during the Second World War. (Michel Chossudovsky, “Wipe the Soviet Union Off the Map”, 204 Atomic Bombs against 66 Major Cities, US Nuclear Attack against USSR Planned During World War II, Global Research, October 27,
The document outlining this diabolical military agenda had been released in September 1945, barely one month after the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki (6 and 9 August, 1945) and two years before the onset of the Cold War (1947).

The secret plan dated September 15, 1945 (two weeks after the surrender of Japan on September 2, 1945 aboard the USS Missouri, see image below) , however, had been formulated at an earlier period, namely at the height of World War II, at a time when America and the Soviet Union were close allies. War with Russia and China
Nuclear Weapons were contemplated to be used against Russia since 1942, and against China since October 1949
Currently, there are detailed plans by the US military (which are in the public domaine) to wage war against both Russia and China.
Four non-compliant countries including China, Russia, Iran and North Korea have been singled out.
World War III scenarios have been contemplated by the Pentagon for more than ten years. They are the object of military simulations (which are classified). Leaked to the Washington Post in 2006, see Vigilant Shield global war scenario using nuclear weapons against China, Russia, Iran, North Korea
At the outset of 2019, War against China and Russia is on the drawing board of the Pentagon. The use of nuclear weapons is contemplated on a preemptive first strike basis. Recent reports (2015-2018) commissioned by the Pentagon confirm the details of Washington’s military agenda against China and Russia (see reports by the Rand Corporation’s War against China project and the 2018 National Defense Strategy Commission, War against China and Russia. On March 1st, 2018 president Vladimir Putin unveiled an array of advanced military technologies in response to renewed US threats to wipe the Russian Federation off the Map, as contained in Trump’s 2018 Nuclear Posture Review .
Below is a review of detailed war plans against Russia and China. These plans are in the public domaine. They are based on the premise that the US can win a nuclear war.
In May 2014, the Russian Aggression Prevention Act (RAPA ) was introduced in the US Senate (S 2277), calling for the militarization of Eastern Europe and the Baltic States and the stationing of US and NATO troops on Russia’s doorstep:
S.2277 – Russian Aggression Prevention Act of 2014
Directs the President to: (1) implement a plan for increasing U.S. and NATO support for the armed forces of Poland, Estonia, Lithuania, and Latvia, and other NATO member-states ; and (2) direct the U.S. Permanent Representative to NATO to seek consideration for permanently basing NATO forces in such countries.
In 2018: the US National Defense Strategy Commission report entitled “Providing for the Common Defense” outlines the contours of a war with Russia
The thrust of the report is that “global peace and stability” and “America’s own security, prosperity, and global leadership” are threatened by Russia and China.
Across Eurasia, grayzone aggression is steadily undermining the security of U.S. allies and partners and eroding American influence. Regional military balances in Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and the Western Pacific have shifted in decidedly adverse ways.
What the report recommends is the conduct of “preemptive” action against both China and Russia, with a view to sustaining US military superiority.
The United States needs more than just new capabilities; it urgently requires new operational concepts that expand U.S. options and constrain those of China, Russia, and other actors.
While the report does describe a possible war scenario with Russia or China, it recommends a sizeable increase in the US military budget. A recommendation which is currently carried out by president Trump.
War with China Scenario
In 2015, a detailed report by the Rand Corporation commissioned by the US Army outlines a war scenario with China
Whereas a clear U.S. victory once seemed probable, it is increasingly likely that a conflict could involve inconclusive fighting with steep losses on both sides. The United States cannot expect to control a conflict it cannot dominate militarily.
http://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR1100/RR1140/RAND_RR1140.pdf
Attack China Preemptively (“In Self Defense”)
The report is notoriously ambiguous. It focusses on how a war can be avoided while analyzing the circumstances under which a preemptive war against China is a win for the US: The presumption of this report is that China is threatening us, which justifies pre-emptive warfare. There is no evidence of a Chinese military threat. The purpose of the RAND report is that Chinese policymakers will read it. What we are dealing with is a process of military intimidation including veiled threats:
While the primary audience for this study is the U.S. policy community, we hope that Chinese policymakers will also think through possible courses and consequences of war with the United States, includ ing potential damage to China’s economic development and threats to China’s equilibrium and cohesion. We find little in the public domain to indicate that the Chinese political leadership has given this matter the attention it deserves.
The Report outlines “Four Analytic Scenarios” on how a war with China could be carried out:
The path of war might be defined mainly by two variables: intensity (from mild to severe) and duration (from a few days to a year or more). Thus, we analyze four cases: brief and severe, long and severe, brief and mild, and long and mild . The main determinant of intensity is whether, at the outset, U.S. and Chinese political leaders grant or deny their respective militaries permission to execute their plans to attack opposing forces unhesitatingly. The concluding comments of the report underscore the potential weakness of China in relation to US-allied forces “…they do not point to Chinese dominance or victory.” The report creates an ideological war narrative. It is flawed in terms of its understanding of modern warfare and weapons systems. It is largely a propaganda ploy directed against the Chinese leadership. It totally ignores Chinese history and China’s military perceptions which are largely based on defending the Nation’s historical national borders. While the US, according to the report, does not contemplate the use nuclear weapons, the report examines the circumstances under which China might use nukes against the US to avoid defeat. The analysis is diabolical:
Thus, it cannot be entirely excluded that the Chinese leadership would decide that only the use of nuclear weapons would prevent total defeat and the state’s destruction. However, even under such desperate conditions, the resort to nuclear weapons would not be China’s only option: It could instead accept defeat. Indeed, because U.S. nuclear retaliation would make the destruction of the state and collapse of the country all the more certain, accepting defeat would be a better option (depending on the severity of U.S. terms) than nuclear escalation. This logic, along with China’s ingrained no-first-use policy, suggests that Chinese first use is most improbable. (p. 30) In other words, China has the option of being totally destroyed or surrendering to the US. The report concludes as follows:
In a nutshell, despite military trends that favor it, China could not win, and might lose, a severe war with the United States in 2025, especially if prolonged. Moreover, the economic costs and political dangers of such a war could imperil China’s stability, end its development, and undermine the legitimacy of the state. (p 68) Unconventional Warfare (UW)
Included in the Pentagon’s arsenal is the use of various instruments of subversion including the support of terrorist insurgencies as outlined the Army Special Operations Forces Unconventional Warfare manual (leaked by Wikileaks).
The emphasis is on using “surrogates”, namely irregular forces, non-state and paramilitary terrorist entities which will do the dirty work for us:
UW [Unconventional Warfare] must be conducted by, with, or through surrogates; and such surrogates must be irregular forces. Moreover, this definition is consistent with the historical reasons that the United States has conducted UW. UW has been conducted in support of both an insurgency, such as the Contras in 1980s Nicaragua, and resistance movements to defeat an occupying power, such as the Mujahideen in 1980s Afghanistan. UW has also been conducted in support of pending or ongoing conventional military operations (p. 1-2)
The stated purpose outlined in Army Field Manual is to use UW to support “insurgencies” and “resistance movements”. The “War on Terrorism” (WAT) is also defined as part of the UW arsenal:
“UW remains an enduring and effective means of warfighting and is recognized as a central effort in the WOT…
ARSOF namely Army Special Forces “support the WOT by providing forces trained and equipped”.
The report focusses on the use of special forces which are integrated into the fabric of the War on Terrorism (WOT). What this means in practice is the processing of embedding of US-NATO forces in Al Qaeda affiliated terrorist insurgencies in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Libya, etc.
Unconventional Warfare (UW) also extends into the realm of financial manipulation, acts of sabotage, cyberwarfare etc. The Army Field Manual on UW also details and condones the instruments of Irregular Warfare (IW) which may resort to illegal activities such as the Iran-Contra:
“Transnational criminal activities, including narco-trafficking, illicit arms dealing, and illegal financial transactions, that support or sustain IW.” The Anti-war Movement: How to Reverse the Tide
Pursuant to the Florence April 7, 2019 Stop NATO Conference, concrete actions would consist in: demanding the withdrawal from NATO by the 29 member states leading to the abolition of NATO. closing down of US bases and military facilities in all NATO member states the withdrawal of all US military personnel from NATO member countries the repeal of payments of NATO member countries for the financing of US military bases and facilities freezing of military budgets, reallocating resources to civilian social programs.
The mass movement would integrate anti-war protest with the campaign against the gamut of neoliberal economic reforms.
To achieve these objectives, what is required is t he development of a broad based grassroots network which seeks to disable patterns of authority and decision making pertaining to war and the economy. This is by no means an easy and straightforward undertaking. The NGOs funded by Wall Street control a variety of “protest movements”. Since the Iraq war(2003) the anti-war movement is virtually non existent.
This network would be established nationally and internationally at all levels of society, towns and villages, work places, parishes. Trade unions, farmers organizations, professional associations, business associations, student unions, veterans associations, church groups would be called upon to integrate the antiwar organizational structure. Of crucial importance, this movement should extend into the Armed Forces as a means to breaking the legitimacy of war both within the command structure as well as among service men and women.
A related task (as a priority) would be to disable war propaganda through an effective campaign against media disinformation. (including support of the online independent and alternative media). This is no easy task given the wave of censorship against freedom of speech as well as the online manipulation of search engines and social media referrals. What has to be achieved as a first priority is to dismantle the propaganda apparatus which sustains the legitimacy of war and neoliberalism. In that regard, the independent media has failed. The power structures behind the mainstream media, social media, etc, must be confronted.
Without this network of media disinformation, the war criminals in high office wouldn’t have a leg to stand on .
Beware however of the flow of ideas emanating from several alleged progressive NGOs and “Left intellectuals” who are often financed by the establishment foundations. These are the entities which organize the so-called protest movements, generously funded by corporate foundations.
Intellectuals should not be the driving force of a Worldwide anti-war movement. What is required is a democratization of research and analysis, which serves to support a mass grass roots movement. The complexity of the global system (its military,economic, political dimensions) must be understood by the grassroots of the movement.
Changes within the Armed Forces, Security, Intelligence Law Enforcement apparatus are required with a view to eventually democratizing the command structures. Democratizing the decision-making apparatus of police and law enforcement is also something to be contemplated.
It is worth mentioning that while millions of people across the World have gathered under the banner of “Global Warming” and Climate Change, todays wars including Syria, Yemen, Iraq, Afghanistan, Venezuela are not mentioned. Nor are the dangers of a Third World War.
The issue of poverty and Worldwide unemployment resulting from the imposition of neoliberal reforms is also sidetracked.
And the police apparatus is repressing the Yellow Vest movement.
There is also the unspoken issue pertaining to “Left intellectuals” who are often coopted into playing lip service in favor of US-NATO humanitarian wars including Yugoslavia (1999), Afghanistan (2001), not to mention Syria (2011) and Libya (2011).
While climate change is a legitimate concern, why are these protest movements limited to global warming. The answer is that many of the key organizations involved are generously funded by Wall Street foundations, including the Rockefellers, Tides, Soros., et al.
The Wall Street protagonists of war and neoliberalism are funding dissent against Wall Street. It’s what I would describe as “manufactured dissent”.
Challenging the Corporate Media
The corporate media would be directly challenged including major news outlets, which are responsible for channelling disinformation into the news chain. This endeavor would require a parallel process at the grass roots level, of sensitizing and educating fellow citizens on the nature of the war and the global crisis, as well as effectively “spreading the word” through advanced networking, through alternative media outlets on the internet, etc. It would also require a broad based campaign against the search engines involved in media censorship on behalf of the Pentagon.
The creation of such a movement, which forcefully challenges the legitimacy of the structures of political authority, requires a degree of solidarity, unity and commitment unparalleled in World history. It would require breaking down political and ideological barriers within society and acting with a single voice . It would also require eventually unseating the war criminals in high office, and indicting them for war crimes.
Abandon the Battlefield: Refuse to Fight
The military oath taken at the time of induction demands unbending support and allegiance to the US Constitution, while also demanding that US troops obey orders from their President and Commander in Chief:

From Caitlin Johnstone Website – Advertisement –
The WikiLeaks Twitter account has announced that it has high level information that the organization’s founder Julian Assange could have his political asylum the Ecuadorian embassy revoked for him to be arrested by the British government within hours. We need to be ready to shake the earth should this happen. We need all hands on deck for this one.
“BREAKING: A high level source within the Ecuadorian state has told @WikiLeaks that Julian Assange will be expelled within ‘hours to days’ using the #INApapers offshore scandal as a pretext — and that it already has an agreement with the UK for his arrest,” the leak publishing outlet tweeted , with a link to a story about the INA Papers leak.
The pretext that is being used is almost irrelevant. Assange has been a target of the US-centralized power establishment ever since WikiLeaks began publishing authentic documents exposing the malfeasance of its leaders a decade ago, and strings are being pulled around the world to funnel him into its jaws. That’s all that this is, but it should surprise no one that the pretext is bogus as well. Journalist Elizabeth Vos wrote an article for Consortium News the other day summarizing the false narrative being spun by the Ecuadorian government that the conditions of asylum have been violated by the WikiLeaks account (not Assange) tweeting about a scandal that has rocked Ecuador’s president Lenin Moreno. – Advertisement –
WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) April 4, 2019
To be clear, it is a known fact that the US government is working to arrest and imprison Assange, not for the Russia stuff that has had establishment loyalists so excited over the last couple of years, but for the 2010 leaks exposing US war crimes. The US has an extradition treaty with the UK, and the British government has refused to comment on whether or not it has received an extradition request for the Assange arrest that we absolutely know for a fact is an existing US government agenda. This would be the same US government which tortured Chelsea Manning after refusing her a fair trial . – Advertisement –
If Assange is arrested and prosecuted under the Patriot Act, it will be a devastating blow to press freedoms and constitute a greater leap in the direction of Orwellian dystopia than the Patriot Act did. The US government exercising the ability to imprison journalists for simply publishing facts about it, not just in America but anywhere in the world, will be a poisoned dagger in the heart of the world population’s ability to bring any transparency or accountability to that titanic power structure.
“WikiLeaks reports that Julian Assange is on the verge of being expelled from the Ecuadorean Embassy in London,” tweeted the legendary journalist John Pilger in response to today’s news. “Please fill the street outside the embassy and protect him, and show solidarity with a courageous man, whose struggle ought to touch us all.”
Yes please. WikiLeaks reports that Julian Assange is on the verge of being expelled from the Ecuadorean Embassy in London. Please fill the street outside the embassy and protect him, and show solidarity with a courageous man, whose struggle ought to touch us all. https://t.co/xzZKroYJL9
John Pilger (@johnpilger) April 4, 2019
We are about to find out if this is the part of the movie where the empire rips off the mask of freedom and democracy and reveals its true tyranny. Assange is a soft target, a controversial figure who has been on the receiving end of wildly successful smear campaigns marketed to every major political faction across the western world. He is the logical place to begin a crackdown on press freedoms and make a public example of what happens to those who shine the light of truth upon Big Brother. – Advertisement –
If we allow them to imprison Julian Assange for practicing journalism, that’s it. It’s over. We might as well all stop caring what happens to the world and sit on our hands while the oligarchs drive us to ecological disaster, nuclear annihilation or Orwellian dystopia. If we, the many, don’t have the spine to stand up against the few and say “No, we get to find out facts about you bastards and use it to inform our worldview, you don’t get to criminalize that,” then we certainly don’t have the spine it will take to wrest control of this world away from the hands of sociopathic plutocrats and take our fate into our own hands.
The arrest of Julian Assange would be the fork in the road. It would be where we collectively decide as a species whether we want to survive into the future, and if we deserve to."
Iran Army deploys heavy-duty dredger to flood-hit province,www.therussophile.org,Michael Sullivan,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/iran-army-deploys-heavy-duty-dredger-to-flood-hit-province.html/,"This post was originally published on this site

Iran’s Army has deployed a special, heavy-duty dredger to a northern province severely hit by recent flooding to speed up the redirecting of floodwaters to the sea.
Chief Commander of the Iranian Army Major General Abdolrahim Mousavi, who is on his second visit to the flooded areas of Iran’s Golestan Province, said on Friday that the dredger had been launched in order to allow larger amounts of water to be re-channeled downstream and toward the Caspian Sea through a major river in the area.
The operation will help redirect floodwaters from the badly-hit cities of Aq Qala and Gamishan through the Gorganroud River toward the sea further north.
The Caspian littoral — where Golestan Province is located — is one of Iran’s two low-lying regions.
The province was hit with heavy rainfall beginning on March 19. Rivers and smaller streams overflew their banks as a result. Some three dams in the region also burst. But the flooding was not confined to Golestan. At least 22 other provinces, out of the country’s 31, have seen heavy downpours and often flooding.

Major General Mousavi explained that the dredger could operate in rivers and shallow waters, cutting up hard sediment and rocks and churning them away to the sides of the waterbed.
“Given that the rivers of the region adjacent to the Caspian Sea basin require dredging, [the machine] will also be used in other regions [in Iran’s north] after finishing its operations in this channel,” Mousavi added.
That operation would in turn make it easier for loaders to work to widen the channel of water, according to the Iranian Army chief.
The dredger of the Iranian Army was earlier transported to the region from the southeastern city of Khorramshahr by three Iranian Air Force transport planes.
Meanwhile, relief efforts continue across the country, with professional and voluntary relief teams being sent to many flood-stricken areas. Helicopters have also been used to get aid to locations made inaccessible via land due to the floods.
Much effort is also being put in enforcing existing dikes and building new ones to withstand potentially more flooding in populous areas.
Unprotected areas at risk of flooding have been evacuated.
The unprecedented rainfall has caused major floods in the provinces of Golestan, Mazandaran, Gilan, Kordestan, Lorestan, Fars, Northern Khorasan, Kermanshah, Khuzestan, Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad, and Sistan-and-Baluchestan.
Estimates by government agencies suggest that the floods have taken the lives of at least 67 people, injured nearly 800, and destroyed over 25,000 houses around the country.
Lorestan is said to have suffered the second highest amount of casualties after Fars Province, based on official reports.

"France won’t take back Daesh terrorists, their families captured in Syria: Interior minister",www.therussophile.org,Michael Sullivan,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/france-wont-take-back-daesh-terrorists-their-families-captured-in-syria-interior-minister.html/,"This post was originally published on this site

French Interior Minister Christophe Castaner has dismissed reports that his country is mulling over repatriating Daesh militants and their families detained in Syria after the elimination of the self-proclaimed “caliphate” of the Takfiri terrorist group in the war-torn country.
“It’s logical that our services considered all hypotheses. This was one of the hypotheses they prepared,” Castaner said at a press conference on Friday following a meeting of G7 interior ministers in Paris.
“No communal repatriation was under consideration to be carried out,” he said, reiterating that France would nonetheless study bringing back children of the terrorists on a “case-by-case basis.”
The top French diplomat also rejected an allegation by daily newspaper Libération that France’s policy with regards to Daesh in Syria was being dictated by public opinion.
Libération reported on Friday that the government had voiced readiness in early March to repatriate around 250 men, women and children before it decided to shelve the plan over public outrage.
Last month, French authorities for the first time brought home five orphaned children of French Daesh terrorists from camps in northeastern Syria.
Up to 1,700 French nationals are thought to have traveled to Iraq and Syria to join the Takfiri terrorists between 2014 and 2018, according to government figures. About 300 are believed to have died in combat.
Prominent French militant Jean-Michel Clain was killed in Syria in mid-February as US-backed and Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) were fighting to retake the group’s last enclave in the eastern Syrian province of Dayr al-Zawr.
Clain’s wife Dorothee Maquere told AFP on March 5 that he had been killed in mortar shelling less than two weeks ago.
Maquere, fully veiled in black and surrounded by her five children, added that her husband had earlier been wounded when the US-led coalition purportedly fighting Daesh carried out a drone strike against the village of Baghouz near the Iraqi border on February 20.
“The drone killed my brother-in-law (Fabien) and then the mortar killed my husband,” she said as she was cradling her two-week-old baby under a red blanket at a screening area run by SDF militants.
Fabien Clain, 41, achieved notoriety after he claimed responsibility for a series of violent attacks targeting cafes and a concert hall in the French capital city of Paris on November 13, 2015, which took the lives of at least 129 people.

US Pressures International Criminal Court Prosecutor In Attempt To Sabotage Investigation Of War Crimes In Afghanistan,www.therussophile.org,uchfkaf32,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/us-pressures-international-criminal-court-prosecutor-in-attempt-to-sabotage-investigation-of-war-crimes-in-afghanistan.html/,"This post was originally published on this site

The US has revoked the visa for the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court Fatou Bensouda in attempt to sabotage a possible investigation of US war crimes in Afghanistan.
The data regarding the decision to revoke Bensouda’s visa was revealed by her office on April 5. The statement added that Bensouda would continue to pursue her duties for the Hague-based court “without fear or favour” despite the ban.
“What we can confirm is that the US authorities have revoked the prosecutor’s visa for entry into the US,” the Office of the Prosecutor of the ICC said in own statement. Fatou Bensouda is the chief prosecutor for the International Criminal Court in The Hague. (Peter Dejong/AP)
There was no immediate comment on Bensouda’s visa ban from Washington. However, the revealed move followed an earlier announcement of restrictions on ICC staff who probe US or allied personnel by US State Secretary Mike Pompeo.
The decision to pressure Bensouda is likely related to her request to ICC judges in November 2017 for authorisation to open an investigation into alleged war crimes in Afghanistan by the Taliban, Afghan government forces and international forces including US troops.
So far, the court has not decided whether to launch a full-blown probe. However, the recent developments show that the court may have been close to a postivie decision.
On March 15, Pompeo claimed that the ICC was “attacking America’s rule of law”. He was “announcing a policy of US visa restrictions on those individuals directly responsible for any ICC investigation of US personnel.”
“If you’re responsible for the proposed ICC investigation of US personnel in connection with the situation in Afghanistan you should not assume that you still have, or will get, a visa or that you will permitted to enter the United States,” Pompeo said.
Reports regarding civilian casualties caused by actions of the US and its allies appear on a regular basis. However, these casualties and other war crimes of US forces and their allies, both international and local, remain not undressed by the international community. MORE ON THE TOPIC:"
Book Review: Russia’s Futures,www.therussophile.org,PaulR,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/book-review-russias-futures.html/,"This post was originally published on this site
I’ve been accused of being an extreme centrist. Or was it a centrist extremist? I can’t exactly remember. But as far as I could make out, the point of the accusation was that this blog is just too balanced, that I bend over so far backwards in my attempts to be even that all I ever say is ‘on the one hand, on the other hand’, relentlessly occupying the middle ground, and refusing to take a firm stand on anything. Russia isn’t the evil dictatorship it’s made out to be, but it’s not all warm hugs and cuddles either. The war in Ukraine isn’t just Russian aggression, it’s a civil war, but the Russians are in it up to their necks regardless. That sort of thing.
The same accusation might plausibly also be laid against Richard Sakwa of the University of Kent in the UK. Sakwa is one of the most prominent Russia experts in the English-speaking world, being the author of numerous books on Russian politics, including astandard undergraduate textbook on the subject. I suspect that in general Sakwa’s politics are a little to the left of mine, but when it comes to things Russian I find that I agree with him 99% of the time. I was rather pleased, therefore, when his latest book Russia’s Futures arrived unprompted in my mailbox recently. I immediately buckled down to reading it, and I wasn’t disappointed.
Russia’s Futures provides readers with a broad survey of the Russian political and economic systems, Russia’s place in the world, the main ideological currents in Russian society, and the like. It’s clearly aimed at a general rather than a specialist audience. As such, it’s more a summary of what Sakwa has concluded from his 30 years of professional studies than a piece of original academic research. Footnotes citing serious academic articles are interspersed with occasional references to the likes of Paul Goble and Russia Insider (there’s balance for you!). Looking at the footnotes, I suspect the influence of Johnson’s Russia List. But Sakwa can be forgiven one or two eccentric references. He knows his stuff, and the result is an impressively even-handed discussion of Russia’s present situation and likely future development.
Sakwa starts out by telling us that Russia’s ‘reality is multi-planed, plural and diverse’. Readers should therefore ‘be aware of the undoubted negative features of contemporary Russia, while remaining alive to how the system has developed in recent years and delivered enormous public goods.’ This pretty much sets the tone for the extremist centrism (or is centrist extremism?) which follows.
Analyzing the Russian political system, Sakwa lays out the theory he has developed elsewhere that Russia has a ‘dual state’. On the one hand, there is the constitutional system; on the other hand, there is the ‘administrative regime’ which is ‘not effectively constrained’ by the former. The constitutional order matters and prevents the system from descending into a dictatorship. But constitutionalism is undermined by a lack of rule of law, corruption, nepotism, and so on. Consequently, Russia is ‘far more than a “kleptocracy” or a personalized autocracy, yet rather less than a functioning, accountable and competitive democracy.’
As for Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, he is a ‘conservative centrist’, as is his regime. Sakwa informs us that, ‘Putin’s statecraft is his ability to draw strength from all of the epistemic blocs but to become dependent on none … incompatible groups and ideas are kept in permanent balance.’ Putin, says Sakwa, ‘acts as the arbiter between elite groups and institutions … Each can participate in policy making and the political process in general, but none can capture the state.’ Sakwa doesn’t use the word ‘corporatist’, but it strikes me that this might be a good way of describing this system. The state has ways of involving all interested parties in the decision making process. Everybody gets a chance to influence government. But it’s done through the office of the presidency, and through extra-constitutional mechanisms, rather than through elected representatives. As Sakwa puts it, ‘Diverse non-constitutional bodies such as the Civic Chamber … act to aggregate policy communities and express societal concerns, but without the overt politicization which is characteristic of parliamentary politics. The presidency is thereby shielded from capture by any one group or faction in society, but works to ensure that none is entirely excluded.’
The result is not entirely undemocratic. As Sakwa says, ‘the Putin system is a fair reflection of the society at large.’ But Sakwa considers this system unsustainable and merely a ‘breathing space’ which ‘will sooner or later give way to something else.’ The system results in centrist policies which balance all the interests within society, but the problem with this centrism is that it ‘thwarts a clear plan for the future … the outcome is stasis’, preventing the kind of structural reforms which Sakwa considers necessary for Russia’s development, especially in the economic sphere.
The Russian economy, Sakwa claims, contains a ‘contradictory amalgam’ of elements of liberalization and state-led economic mobilization. He notes numerous economic achievements, and comments that ‘the Putin system of mutual responsibility has ensured that a good quotient of the rents are directed to socially useful purposes.’ But, as if once again to show his sense of balance, he points also to considerable deficiencies, such as poor protection of property rights and a lack of investment in education and health care. ‘Russia today has clear symptoms of economic dysfunction that can only be resolved through systemic reform.’ Sakwa concludes.
Sakwa’s even-handedness is somewhat less evident in his discussion of Russian foreign policy, though even here he avoids extremes. He is clearly sympathetic to the Russian claim that current East-West tensions are largely the fault of the West. He describes the prevailing Russian foreign policy ideology as ‘liberal statism’ – liberal in the sense of being committed to the basic principles and institutions of the ‘liberal international order’, such as the United Nations, the WTO, international law, and so on; but statist in the sense of emphasizing state sovereignty. According to Sakwa, ‘The cardinal postulate of Russia’s neo-revisionism is commitment to the norms of international society vertically, but resistance to the (hegemonic) practices of the US-led order horizontally.’ In this way, Russia challenges US leadership of the international order, but not the order itself.
Sakwa places all of this within the theoretical framework of ‘neo-modernization’. Classical modernization theory equated modernization with Westernization, and argued that being modern meant adopting Western models of liberalism and democracy. According to Sakwa, ‘The idea of “neo-modernization” challenges classical views while asserting that modernization does have certain universal features, but that these have to be combined with specific national cultural and economic traditions.. … countries can be modern in different ways.’ Russia’s problem, says Sakwa, is that it has been consistently ‘mismodernized’. By contrast, Japan is an example of a country which has managed to modernize while avoiding becoming Westernized. ‘It is this combination that continues to elude Russia’, says Sakwa.
This makes sense, but whereas I agree almost totally with everything Sakwa says, at this point I do find myself having some problems with his thesis. For what is the peculiarly Russian model of modernity which is on offer? Sakwa himself notes that, ‘the model of modernity in Russia today is closer to that of the West than ever before, and there are no fundamental ideological differences.’ Discussing the idea that Russia’s political system is unstable because it is neither one thing nor the other – neither democracy nor authoritarian – Sakwa strongly suggests that moving in the direction of the former is desirable. Likewise, his call for ‘structural economic reform’ strikes me also as a demand for Russia to become more Western. In short, Russia’s ‘neo-modernization’ ends up looking rather like Westernization after all.
At one point Sakwa mentions the Russian conservative philosopher Boris Mezhuev as an example of someone proposing the neo-modernization he has in mind. I recall a conference that Sakwa, Mezhuev and I attended in Moscow a couple of years ago. At this, I pointed out to Mezhuev that I couldn’t tell what it was he that he was proposing for Russia which was in any way different from the Western liberalism he was criticzing. How did his vision of democracy differ from that of Western democracy? As I recall, he failed to provide an answer. And here’s the problem – pushed to say what the unique Russian path to modernity consists of, many of its proponents can’t actually say. They don’t like Westernization, but when pressed they don’t have a concrete alternative to offer.
In the end, therefore, I don’t find the neo-modernization thesis particularly convincing. At heart, I guess, I really am a Francis Fukayama ‘End of History’ type of Western liberal after all. Despite this, however, I strongly recommend Russia’s Futures . There are so many books out there portraying Russia in an absurdly negative light, that it’s deeply refreshing to come across something which is extremist only in its sense of balance. Of course, that conclusion reflects my own bias – I like the book in large part because I agree with it. Extreme Russophobes and extreme Russophiles will no doubt hate it (especially the former, I suspect). But if you have an open mind and you’re looking for a readable introduction to Russian politics, Russia’s place in the world, and Russia’s possible futures, this is as good as you can currently find.

"Everything on Bellingcat and the official inquiry into the destruction of Flight MH17, by Jürgen Cain Külbel",www.therussophile.org,Michael Sullivan,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/everything-on-bellingcat-and-the-official-inquiry-into-the-destruction-of-flight-mh17-by-jurgen-cain-kulbel.html/,"This post was originally published on this site https://www.voltairenet.org/local/cache-vignettes/L113xH150/arton205934-980bd.jpg A bouquet of flowers on the wreckage of Flight MH17. This Boeing 777, travelling from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, was destroyed on 17 July 2014 over the zones of combat between the Kiev putchists and the Donbass independentists, killing the 298 persons on board. Since then, the two camps have been accusing one another of being responsible for this catastrophe. The Western powers finally adopted the hypothesis published on the British Internet site Bellingcat. Daniël Romein and the journalists of De Volkskrant
He calls himself Daniël Romein. That is not his real name. We made an appointment to meet in a cafe. He sits down, seeming a little embarrassed. He has a friendly face. From time to time, he glances to the right. Then he looks at the people outside who are walking in the rain. « I always try to have a head start on my adversary », he says. And for him, the enemy is Russia. He wants to take precautions. « As a specialist in computers, I know what counter-measures I need to apply ». And he adds –« This job is risky, because I know that the Russians are really unhappy about our research ».
In February 2016, Daniël Romein met with a group of journalists in this cafe [ 1 ] – secretly, of course. Huib Modderkolk and Bert Lanting from the Amsterdam daily De Volkskrant wrote later that Romein’s « discoveries » were the foundation of the Bellingcat reports in 2015 and 2016 on the catastrophe of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 (MH17). Jikke Zijlstra and Michael de Smit, of Nederlandse Omroep Stichting (NOS), a Dutch public service radio station, noted that –« Although [British subject Eliot] Higgins is the founder of Bellingcat, their Dutch employee, Daniël Romein, wrote the greater part of the report (in 2016) ». Modderkolk and Lanting even wrote that Romein had provided the basis for these reports, that he was the principal author of the studies, and that he works « in secret for the Bellingcat research collective. Almost no-one knows this. His family, his friends, his colleagues – most of them don’t know. He likes to maintain a small circle. He himself estimates their number at a maximum of ten. Last year (2015), he was engaged in research to discover which Russian soldiers were implicated in the destruction of Flight MH17 », and uses « his computer as a weapon. He watches his screen for hours, scrolling through Russian Web sites and the social media. He does this by choice, on top of his work as an IT professional. Sometimes he works very late – until two o’clock in the morning – and comes to work at the office the next morning with tired eyes … that’s when it becomes difficult, and he can’t talk to anyone. « Sometimes it feels as if I’m living a double life ». Romein declared to the journalist that media attention should be focused on the people involved rather than on himself – he wants remain anonymous. « Only his colleagues in Bellingcat know his real identity », affirms De Volkskrant. Daniël Romein, liaison agent between Bellingcat and the Joint Investigation Team
Around Christmas 2015, on the request of the founder of Bellingcat, Eliot Higgins, Romein sent his work of investigation and that of Bellingcat to the Dutch Openbaar Ministerie, in other words the Public Prosecutor’s Office, which takes precedence over the Joint Investigation Team (JIT) tasked with the international criminal investigation into the catastrophe of Flight MH17. The Public Minister declared that he would « pay serious attention to the information, including its usefulness for the criminal investigation ». « They are satisfied with our efforts and our work », declared Romein, who has regular contacts with the detectives from the JIT. For example, on an invitation from the JIT, he had on numerous occasions exchanged information on Bellingcat’s enquiries with the Public Prosecutor’s team. Eliot Higgins, the head alchemist of Bellingcat, was twice heard as a witness. Bellingcat’s « criminological investigators »
Eliot Higgins’ firm Bellingcat, the « research platform of citizen journalists » which brags that it carries out « criminalistic enquiries », enjoys an uninterrupted barrage of media hype in the dominant Western medias – due to their « investigations » into the catastrophe of Flight MH17 or in the case of the poisoning of the Skripals. However, the methodology of the group, its conclusions, and its impartiality raise some very serious doubts. The dominant Press unhesitatingly elevates the members of the team to the rank of « experts ». But the Bellingcats charged in 2015 and 2016 with the enquiry into the affair of Flight MH17 do not stand out either as recognised experts, nor as investigators who specialise in the legal sciences. They are
Pieter van Huis (Dutch), degree in History, Stijn Mitzer (Oryx), analyst and blogger, Daniel Romein, IT specialist Sean Case (British), specialist in environmental sciences and plants, Eliot Higgins, director of Bellingcat, without any significant qualification, the Americans Andrew Haggard, ex-member of the US army, Aric Toler, literary researcher and linguist, Nathan Patin, ex-intern in foreign politics and defence for the American Enterprise Institute think tank in Washington, Veli-Pekka Kivimäki (Finnish), an officer at the University of the Finnish Defence Forces in Helsinki, Olaf Neitsch alias Timmi Allen (German), ex-employee in a service of the Ministry of State Security of the RDA , ex-owner of a pub, today an insurance salesman, Igor Ostanin (Magnitski), (Russian) freelancer, as well as Anders Klement of StopFake, an anti-Russian propaganda initiative based in Kiev.
We should keep on mind – independent of the fact that Bellingcat is supported by sponsors such as George Soros’ Open Society – that among the « founding members » of the group in 2014 and 2015, we find the British ex-spy Cameron Colquhoun and Nour Bakr from the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Chris Bigger from the US National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) as well as Christoph Koettl from the New York Times , Leroy Aliaume from BBC World , and Aaron Stein from the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), a British research institute connected with the Intelligence Services – even a blind person could understand where Bellingcat’s « expertise of savoir-faire » is going. Their intention is to howl like a cat in heat, and make a lot of noise, all of it aimed at Russia.
Neutrality, objectivity, impartiality – the qualities which should distinguish a professional investigator and an expert – do not work this way. Normality in the daily life of the legal and security organisms of each country resides in the fact that the criminalistic investigations and associated reports are carried out by qualified experts, and that the resulting report, like any other proof, has in any case no conclusive value if it has been decided in advance. Only the tribunal can decide on its conclusive value. The reports must therefore contain a certain number of definite qualitative characteristics, such as the presentation of elements of proof, the method of investigation, etc. Journalists from the general public, in particular those of the trans-Atlantic persuasion, deliberately ignore the necessity of a precise scientific and legal approach, and fail to question the accuracy of Bellingcat’s reports on any point. They therefore practice the art of copy and paste so that later, they will be able to pocket the coward’s reward of thirty pieces of silver. Why is « Daniël Romein » investigating the catastrophe of Flight MH17?
Question of the enquiry : What motivates Daniël to analyse the catastrophe of MH17?
Result of the enquiry : Modderkolk and Lanting have written that « the images haunted him ». For him, the catastrophe is a mixture of terror and obsession… He has been interested in this region for some time. He learned Russian a long time ago … He visits all sorts of Web forums. « I wanted to know who did it ». The members of the Dutch forums seem ill-informed. He quickly seeks out Ukrainian and Russian forums. « Jikke Zijlstra and Michael de Smit from NOS, who qualified the search for the authors of these crimes as being almost obsessional », gave us this quote: « It’s on my mind a lot. The catastrophe really moved me. I thought it was so terrible, I was so angry, even though I knew none of the victims personally,.I wanted to know who were the idiots behind it all ». The genesis of the research into the « Daniël Romein » Character
According to Wikipedia: « Open-source intelligence (OSINT) is data collected from publicly available sources to be used in an Intelligence context.[1] In the Intelligence community, the term “open” refers to overt, publicly available sources (as opposed to covert or clandestine sources) ». The definition is rather pretentious, since it concerns no more than the minimal daily work of criminal investigations; going from house to house, knocking on doors, so to speak – but in this case, it means visiting the Internet on the World Wide Web, scrolling from blog to blog, from post to post.
Knocking on the doors of OSINT via Yandex and Google in order to find « Daniël Romein » led nowhere; most of the entries were linked to Bellingcat. However, the Dutch search engine Geneanet proposed the variant « Romein / Romijn ». The entry « Daniel Romijn » generated almost 2 million results. Using the combination « Romein Romijn », Commissioner Hasard found a broken link which it was possible to reconnect with the Wayback Machine: on the page Pink Floyd Fans Nederlands, the Floydian author Theo wrote about the musician « Danyo Romijn (keyboards, guitar, Hammond) », whom he named, a few lines further on in the same message, as « Danyo Romein ». Research into the meaning and origins of the name reveals that « Danyo » is the German variant of Daniel. Searching for « Daniël Romein »
From the rare publications in the Dutch media on « Daniël Romein », we note that he
has been working for Bellingcat since November 2014, is Dutch, works in an office during the day, speaks fluent Russian and has skills in photography.
Answer 1 : Daniël Romein, Danyo Romijn and computer science
The search using « Daniël Romein » and « IT » gave no results; « Danyo Romijn », associated with « IT » hit the spot on Linkedin. On that site, a certain « Danyo Romijn » from The Hague introduces himself as an « IT expert in the management of applications, and developer of software ». After having studied computer science at the Den Haag University of Applied Sciences (from 1988 to 1995), he worked from February to September 1996 as a developer of software at the Ministerie van Binnenlandse Zaken en Koninkrijksrelaties (Minister of the Interior and Relations of the Kingdom – BZK) before being transferred to the Immigratie – en Naturalisatiedienst (Immigration and Naturalisation Service – IND). As from May 1997, he pursued his activities in the IT sector as a developer of software and Web applications from April 2010 to November 2016 as a specialist in IT applications in the province of Zuid-Holland. In November 2016, he changed direction and joined the team of the POSG Den Haag project, provider of services for Work and Careers. Danyo Romijn’s profile on Contactout.com identifies him as a specialist in IT technologies, a regional coordinator in the province of Zuid-Holland, and a member of the Tibet Support Group; on contactout.com one can also find a fragment of his email address – d**** [email protected]
Answer 2 : « Danyo Romijn » and « Photography »
A search using a combination of « Danyo Romijn » and « Photografie » revealed another match.
Beeldbank Haags Gemeentearchief not only proposes photos by « Danyo Romijn », with all sorts of views of the street, but also his complete electronic address: d****@gmail.com (which we shall not reveal here). In Europeana’s online collection, you can also see 152 photos by « Danyo Romijn ».
Answer 3 : « Danyo Romijn » and « MH17 »
The search for « Danyo Romijn » combined with « MH17 » provided a break-through. From Monday 4 to Wednesday 6 August 2014, a user named « Danyo Romijn » published a total of 14 contributions concerning his own enquiries about the catastrophe of MH17 on the English-language discussion forum Niqnaq. He posted links to photos from the Russian and Ukrainian medias, and described his research on a multi-lingual Russian social network, Vkontakte.ru, on DNR Press, on the page of the Ukrainian Intelligence services, on the page of the Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs, concluding that the « rebels » of Donetsk, who had stolen the BUK-M1 missile system on 29 June 2014, could have used it to shoot down the plane. He also deduced that the shape of the « impact holes » in the cockpit could have been made by a BUK-M1, but at this moment formulated no direct incriminations. In short, he had looked into this affair extensively at that time; far more than an average consumer who wishes only to inform himself. This « Danyo Romijn », we may now affirm with a probability close to certainty, had researched the matter in full knowledge of the facts.
Question of the enquiry : Is Danyo Romijn, the user who had signed on to Niqnaq, really identical to the Dutch IT specialist« Danjo Romijn »?
Result of the enquiry : « An IP address is an address on the IT networks, which, like the Internet, is based on Internet protocol. It is given to the computers which are connected to the network, rendering them addressable and thus accessible », indicates Wikipedia. From the United Kingdom, the author received the information that user « Danyo Romijn » had connected to Niqnaq with the IP address 213.86.41.20 and the email address d**** [email protected] , which had already been attributed to Dutch user Danyo Romijn. This IP denomination belongs in turn to a « composite » IP – IP 213.86.41.16 à 213.86.41.23 – of du NET-NL-PROVINCIE-ZUID-HOLLAND.
Intermediate result : The Danyo Romijn who really exists had apparently used his name and his electronic address in August 2014 on the Niqnaq forum during a discussion on the catastrophe of Flight MH17.
Question of the enquiry : Is the Danyo Romijn who really exists the same Daniel Romein who works for Bellingcat?
Result of the enquiry : On the English-language discussion forum Websleuths, at 2.22 p.m. on 2 November 2014 (the post had been erased, but was able to be « resuscitated » by the author), a commentator named « danyoromijn » appeared and added a single post during the discussion on the affair of Flight MH17 : « Hi everyone, this is my first post on this subject on Websleuths, but I’ve been here since 17 July, and I’ve read everything about Bellingcat here and on numerous other sites, including sites in Ukrainian and Russian (I can read a little Russian – Google Translate is my friend). I went to Ukraine and to Russia (in Ukraine recently, I mean two years ago, and to Russia fourteen years ago), which helps me to understand things a little better. I’m surprised that there are only 16 pages on Websleuths when there is so much information we could share … Well, since it’s so complex, I haven’t yet published anything about MH17, but now I have some information which I’d like to share with Bellingcat…».
This user « danyoromijn » also reveals personal information. First of all, he speaks a little Russian. Secondly, the Danyo Romijn who really exists, as claimed by « danyoromijn » on Websleuths, went to Moscow, the capital of Russia, in 2000, and two years later, to Ukraine, where he visited Kiev, Cherkasy, Kirovohrad, Vinnytsia, Zhytomyr, Khmelnytskyi, Lviv, Chernivtsi, Ternopil, Volhynia, the Zakarpattia Oblast, and Rivne. To sum up – so far, Romijn has visited more than 50 countries, including Belarus in 2004, Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia in 2008 and also the United Kingdom in 2015, the home of the « chief expert » for Bellingcats, Eliot Higgins.
A reminder – on 2 November 2014, « danyoromijn » posted on Websleuths that he would like to share some information with Bellingcats. We remember the comments by Modderkolk and Lanting from De Volkskrant , who, in February 2016, described the « work » of Daniel Romein, a member of Bellingcat, in the following terms –« He examines the photos taken by the Russian military forces on Vkontakte, and thus gets to know the region and the Russian military presence. He gleans his topographical knowledge mainly from Google and its Russian equivalent Yandex. In order to collect more photos, he watches the amateur images taken from Dashcams, cameras which film the road as people drive. For hours, he walks back and forth in his room, as if he were journeying to the other side of the frontier between Russia and Ukraine ».
Then –« In November 2014, he sent the summary to the British founder of Bellingcat, Eliot Higgins, who thanked him warmly in return. Two weeks later, he received another email from Higgins. Romein said –« He was impressed when I wanted to do more ». Which he did. There was a flurry of exchanges by e-mail, and Higgins asked Romein if he wanted to join the group. Romein had difficulty in understanding the meaning of that. There was no selection committee, he was not asked to send a letter or even undergo a telephone interview. He met no-one. He had never even shaken Higgins’ hand. In fact, nothing changed. Well, he has access to Bellingcat’s « i-channels »– an information platform where members of Bellingcat send one another messages, which are coded. Roman therefore became the seventh member of Bellingcat » . Initial meeting and communication with Danyo Romijn
At the end of February and the beginning of March, the author contacted Danyo Romijn – the two electronic addresses d*** [email protected] and i** [email protected] turned out to be active – and invited him to answer the following questions:
Author: « Do you have a degree or any training in digital criminalistics and / or digital criminalistics for the study of images? Do you consider yourself an expert in criminal investigations? Do you know how to carry out legal and criminal investigations? »
Since Romijn threatened the author with prosecution, I am only able to quote his replies from memory. After three requests by email, Romijn replied –« I’m sorry, you’re confusing me with someone else. I have nothing to do with Flight MH17 ».
Author: « I am not confusing you with anyone. I followed your previous IP 213.86.41.20 (NET-NL-PROVINCIE-ZUID-HOLLAND). You used it for your communications concerning MH17. We should talk. »
Romijn’s repose, quoted from memory: « My previous job was indeed in the Provincie Zuid-Holland. But I am absolutely certain that we never had any contact by email, and certainly not about Flight MH17. I may have sent someone an email about it, but there’s nothing strange about that. Almost everyone in Holland was talking about it. »
Author : « You’re right, we have not yet had an exchange of emails. I don’t have any emails that you wrote to anyone. I’m talking about your own lP 213.86.41.20, connected to much detailed information concerning Flight MH17 which was researched, produced and written by you a few years ago. »
Romijn’s reply from memory: « That IP address is a general IP address from my previous job, and is one of the rare IP addresses listed on line: http://www.lookip.net/whois/213.86.41.20 . However, I can see no connection between that IP address and any activity by me. My ex-employer would probably not have accepted my writing long fragments of text which were not linked to my work. Whatever you want to write and publish, do not forget that the laws on the protection of personal data are very strict in Holland and Germany. and if you write anything totally stupid about me, you’ll only ridicule yourself – with the added risk that your article may be deleted. And if you break the law, if you commit a digital hack, you also risk an extra ten days in prison. Of course, you may write about my journeys, my work, and my music. I hope that a few people will order my latest CD because of your publication. Smiley. »
Author : « You were very active for a while with that IP address (also linked to one of your message accounts) in order to do your research work on Flight MH17.Please send me a sworn declaration stating that you, Danyo Romijn, have never used the general IP address 213.86.41.20 to research, write or send information about Flight MH17. » Background information about Danyo Romijn
That was the end of my contact with Danyo Romijn. The explanation I requested never arrived, but on the contrary, he deleted his Internet page from the network, and also deleted items on numerous data portals which gave information about himself. However, the author had saved all important data before contacting Romijn.
It is remarkable to note the abundance of information that Danyo Romijn posted on the Web. On his Web site, which was emptied out and is currently « in construction », it is stated that he was born in The Hague on 14 May 1970, where he still lives, that he has a daughter named Patricia, born on 20 October 2005 in The Hague, that he has been divorced since 2009, and has the partial charge of his daughter. « My work since 1996 has been developing software and Web applications, but I also have experience in the management of application changes. I recently followed courses in project management. As well as my job, I have also participated in the development of sites …». Apart from Web sites, his favourite hobbies are his journeys, his music, and his photography. « As far as my journeys are concerned, I have not only travelled in Europe, but also in India, Nepal, Cuba, Aruba and Curaçao. I mostly take photographs when I’m travelling, but I also photograph nature and my daughter. I’ve been working in music for years, as a listener, but also for many years in musical groups and musical projects. Now I play music at home with synthesisers ». Then comes a list of his favourite music, his favourite films, his favourite comedies, his favourite books, his favourite drink, his favourite pet, his favourite colours and his private email address i** [email protected] , Elsewhere, in the forum for Singles Wamba, he gives his height, 1.83m, and his weight, 90kg. He does not smoke, is a social drinker, has a regular income, and would like to meet a « girl » aged between 36 and 40, or else a woman aged between 37 and 45. The difference is not clear for the author. He also practices a Korean form of martial arts, the Taekwondo Koryo.
Danyo Romijns reveals not only all the details of his professional career on his old Web site, but also his leisures –« I also really like photography, which I usually practice on holiday, but also architecture (old buildings), nature, and of course family photos, for example of my daughter Patricia. I always think of myself as an amateur / leisure photographer, even though I have a good eye for composition ». Then he draws up a list of various types of camera which he claims are his.
We can’t confirm that this is a leisure activity, but the Single Romijn is also on the lookout for a woman. Even on this subject, the blood of an investigator courses through his veins. On the Dutch dating site Lexa.nl, he discovered « bad » things, and immediately complained: the names of the women who flirted with him are specifically « always constructed the same way: myszka_a_450, alinda_a_228, butterfly_a_723, karina_b_242, maymay_a_744 , sandra_a_179, monika_c_221, primavera_a_824 and jolanda_a_375 ». Romijn reached his conclusions in the Bellingcat style, « These names are generated by Lexa.nl itself. I don’t like that at all, Lexa.nl really doesn’t need them, there are enough real members, so why create false profiles?? ». Lexa.nl vehemently rejected the « investigations » by Danyo Romijn.
Music is his other passion. He began playing the piano at a young age. At 18, he was interested in hard rock and heavy metal. He played guitar in a metal group called Eclipse, then keyboards and guitar in Pink Project, a Dutch Pink Floyd tribute band. In 1995, he joined the group Nangyala, and in 1997, recorded an album of synthesiser music called Void. Danyo Romijn, alias Danyo Romein, as he was also called by the Floydian Theo, is thus a fan of the British singer, bassist, composer, wordsmith and music producer Roger Waters, the singer of Pink Floyd – the ferocious critic of the White Helmets in Syria – the best friends of Bellngcat? If that does not constitute a conflict of interests! Since the highly experienced experts from Australia, Belgium, Malaysia, Holland and Ukraine, who make up the Joint Investigation Team (JIT), were unable to find proof of Russian responsibility for the catastrophe, they rallied to the conclusions of Daniël Romein and the Bellingcat site: i.e. that the plane was brought down by a missile made in Russia – a strange conclusion which does not correspond to the débris of the aircraft. Conclusion
I shall leave the question of whether the Daniël Romein of Bellingcat is the Danyo Romijn investigated by the author to be answered by the reader. But if you should ask my opinion, I would estimate the probability as being close to 100%.
For me, as an ex-professional investigator, there is another question that needs to be asked: in what sort of pitiful state are the investigation teams led by the Dutch authorities and the Joint Investigation Team – to the point that they adopt the do-it-yourself enquiries of an amateur?
Concerning the catastrophe of Flight MH17, we have published the conclusions of the enquiry by Ivan A. Andrievskii, first Vice-President of the Russian Union of Engineers : “ Analysis of the reasons for the crash of flight MH17 ”, by Ivan A. Andrievskii, Оdnako (Russia) , Voltaire Network , 27 September 2014.

Has Donald Trump Committed Treason?,www.therussophile.org,Eric L. Wattree,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/has-donald-trump-committed-treason.html/,"This post was originally published on this site

By Eric Wattree, The Wattree Chronicles
When Donald Trump took sides with Putin over our own intelligence community in order to help the Russians avoid sanctions in the united states, he committed treason. He placed his own interests and the interest of the Russian government above those of the United States. And if anyone should know how easy it is to commit treason it would be Donald Trump, because he accused the Democrats of committing treason for failing to applaud him during a speech before congress.
But in spite of that, during the 2016 campaign Trump repeatedly lied to the American people about not having any business interests in Russia while he was actively pursuing a deal to build a Trump Tower in Moscow. Even after the Russians mounted a vicious attack against American democracy during the 2016 election, he fought our own congress over placing sanctions on Russian interests in the United States.
So why did he do that? The answer is very simple – The Trump Moscow Tower was being financed by VTB Bank, which, according to NYMag.com, “was then under U.S. sanctions, but switched sources on New Year’s Day to GenBank, also under U.S. sanctions.” So, in order for Trump to do business with the Russian bank – which, due to his 6 bankruptcies was one of the few banks in the world that was still willing to do business with him – U.S. sanctions had to be lifted from VTB Bank. And according to BuzzFeed News, the Trump organization also agreed to give Vladimir Putin a $50 million penthouse suite as part of the deal.
New York Magazine reported that “For at least three decades, Donald Trump has dreamed of a hotel stamped with his gilded name near Moscow’s Red Square. As early as 1987, in The Art of the Deal , Trump imagined “a large luxury hotel across the street from the Kremlin in partnership with the Soviet government.
“Twenty years — and a few failed Russian hotel bids — later, he made a promise in a 2007 court deposition: ‘We will be in Moscow at some point.’ Now, that dream of Russian hospitality is turning nightmarish, as Trump’s former lawyer Michael Cohen stated in federal court on Thursday that he had engaged in talks to license a tower in Moscow deep into the 2016 campaign, potentially exposing the president to charges of perjury .”
But treason is nothing new among conservative politicians, it goes all the way back to the very founding of this nation. In spite of the conservative tendency to wrap themselves in the flag, they’ve always been against true democracy. They brought an aristocratic mindset to America from Europe, and they’ve always believed that the average American’s role in society should be as servants of the rich and powerful. The Civil War, the most brutal war this nation has ever fought, was a direct result of that conservative mindset.
I’m purposely using the term “conservative” rather than political party affiliation to avoid confusion, because Republicans love to routinely point out that it was Democrats who were the Confederates and rebelled against the nation and founded the KKK. But they fail to point out that from the Civil War through the Civil Rights movement of the 1960s, the Democratic Party was made up of Dixiecrats, and Dixiecrats were rabid conservatives.
But beginning with the Franklin Roosevelt administration and his “New Deal” for the American people, through the Civil Rights movement of the sixties, the Democratic and Republican parties completely changed their political polarities. During that time conservatives flooded the Republican Party, and liberals became Democrats. So let there be no doubt about it, conservatives have ALWAYS been this nation’s bigots, regardless of what political party they were in. The very word “Conservative” means to “Conserve” past traditions, including bigotry – both racial, and economic.
Alexander Hamilton, was one of this nation’s conservative founding fathers. He believed that only those who owned property should even be allowed to vote. He also said:
“All communities divide themselves into the few and the many. The first are the rich and wellborn, the other the mass of the people…. The people are turbulent and changing; they seldom judge or determine right. Give therefore to the first class a distinct, permanent share in government. They will check the unsteadiness of the second, and as they cannot receive any advantage by a change, they therefore will ever maintain good government.” Debates of the Federalist Convention (May 14-September 17, 1787).
But the founding fathers who believed in true democracy voted Hamilton’s philosophy down. That didn’t cause conservatives to quietly walk away, however. Instead, they began to use their wealth, power, and influence to divide the people, and they’ve been using that tactic ever since. They had to, because their political philosophy is so hostile to democracy that they’re forced to use subterfuge just to survive – and two of their primary tactics involve the manipulation of the under-educated to stir fear, hatred and greed, and treason, which they never hesitate to use against the American people.
There are several examples of conservative treason in just recent history. In 1968 when President Lyndon Johnson was attempting to negotiate a peace agreement in Vietnam to save American lives, the New York Times reported the following:
Conservative, “ Richard M. Nixon told an aide that they should find a way to secretly “monkey wrench” peace talks in Vietnam in the waning days of the 1968 campaign for fear that progress toward ending the war would hurt his chances for the presidency, according to newly discovered notes.
“In a telephone conversation with H. R. Haldeman , who would go on to become White House chief of staff, Nixon gave instructions that a friendly intermediary should keep “working on” South Vietnamese leaders to persuade them not to agree to a deal before the election, according to the notes, taken by Mr. Haldeman.”
1968 Notes Show Nixon Tried to Spoil Johnsons’ Vietnam Peace Talks
In addition, an article in Wikipedia pointed out that “In 1979, One of the leading national issues during that year was the release of 52 Americans being held hostage in Iran since November 4, 1979. Reagan won the election. On the day of his inauguration—in fact, 20 minutes after he concluded his inaugural address—the Islamic Republic of Iran announced the release of the hostages.
The timing gave rise to an allegation that representatives of Reagan’s presidential campaign had conspired with Iran to delay the release until after the election to thwart President Carter from pulling off an “ October surprise “. So, let’s get this straight. Ronald Reagan colluded with Iran to continue to hold American citizens hostage until after an election.
The article goes on to say, “After twelve years of mixed media attention, both houses of the US Congress held separate inquiries and concluded that the allegations lacked supporting documentation. Nevertheless, several individuals—most notably former Iranian President Abulhassan Banisadr , former naval intelligence officer and U.S. National Security Council member Gary Sick , and former Reagan/Bush campaign staffer and White House analyst Barbara Honegger—have stood by the allegation.”
October Surprise Conspiracy Theory
For the sake of brevity, I’ll just mention in passing how Ronald Reagan flooded the inner cities with crack cocaine to fund his private war in Nicaragua, and how 47 GOP senators tried to sabotage President Obama’s efforts to negotiate a nuclear arms agreement with Iran. PBS reported:
“Monday’s open letter from 47 GOP senators marked an unusually public and aggressive attempt to undermine Obama and five world powers as negotiators try to strike an initial deal by the end of March to limit Iran’s nuclear programs.”
GOP Senators Send Open Letter to Iran Undermining White House Nuke Negotiations
So, while conservatives have a tendency to strut around with flag pins in their lapels, wrap themselves in the American flag, and claim to be such super-patriots, they are none of these things – in fact, for the most part they are irresponsible, self-serving, and cowardly traitors.
When this country called upon Donald Trump to serve during the Vietnam War, in spite of being an athlete in school, he went limping into the draft board with a note from a doctor claiming his feet hurt. The doctor in question was a tenant in one of his father’s buildings. Dick Cheney and Rush Limbaugh did a variation of the same – Limbaugh claiming to have had a boil on his fat ass.
So, you see, dying for your country is the job of the little people – “the losers.” But interesting enough, now that these rabid conservatives don’t have to placed their own lives on the line for the country, all of a sudden they’ve morphed into “Love-it-or-leave-it” super-patriots. It’s the kind of gross hypocrisy that’s a sickening thing to watch. But their conservative followers completely ignore their cowardly hypocrisy and false patriotism, because these men cater exclusively to their supporter’s fear, hatred, and greed.
And Donald Trump is the worst of them all. He’s not only a hypocrite and a coward, but he’s protecting, and passionately embracing some of our most aggressive adversaries, while calling the men and women who have dedicated their lives to protecting this country “the enemy of the people.”
Trump appeals to the very worst in this country’s nature – ignorance, selfishness, hypocrisy, and bigotry – so, anyone who supports him is un-American by definition, regardless to how they try to justify it.
18 U.S. Code § 2381.Treason
“Whoever, owing allegiance to the United States, levies war against them or adheres to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort within the United States or elsewhere, is guilty of treason and shall suffer death, or shall be imprisoned not less than five years and fined under this title but not less than $10,000; and shall be incapable of holding any office under the United States.”

Is Putin making another power grab in the Middle East? Moscow denies backing renegade Libyan general | Daily Mail Online,www.therussophile.org,Michael Sullivan,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/is-putin-making-another-power-grab-in-the-middle-east-moscow-denies-backing-renegade-libyan-general-daily-mail-online.html/,"This post was originally published on this site Is Putin making another power grab in the Middle East? Moscow denies backing renegade Libyan general who is marching on Tripoli – amid suspicions of a Russian hand in looming civil war Libyan strongman Khalifa Haftar announced this week that his forces are currently marching on Tripoli Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists Russia was not backing Haftar in his bid to take over Libya Fears are rising that the country could descend into civil war if Haftar’s army clashes with other rival factions Published: 06:27 EDT, 5 April 2019 | Updated: 10:57 EDT, 5 April 2019 Advertisement Russia has denied supporting a Libyan general who is currently marching on Tripoli in an apparent attempt to take control of the north African nation. Rebel strongman Khalifa Haftar, who controls the eastern-based Libyan National Army, is pushing west towards Tripoli, to challenge the internationally recognised government. Militias in the west have vowed to confront the army command’s attempt to seize the capital, sparking fears of a renewed civil war. This morning, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said he hoped the crisis would not lead to ‘renewed bloodshed’, adding that Moscow did not support Haftar. Asked if Russia considered supporting Libya militarily, Peskov said: ‘No, Moscow is not taking part in this in any way.’ The military thrust by Haftar’s LNA marks a dangerous escalation of a power struggle that has dragged on since the overthrow of Colonel Gaddafi in 2011. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres was due to meet Haftar in Benghazi today in a bid to avert war. A video published on the Libyan strongman Khalifa Haftar’s Facebook page on Wednesday allegedly shows military convoys heading towards western Libya and Tripoli Haftar’s trucks were filmed lining the road to Tripoli this week as the leader proclaimed on Facebook that his forces would be heading to the capital Militia faction leader Khalifa Haftar is moving towards Tripoli from the country’s east along with his army, sparking fears of a civil war Strongman Haftar, backed by Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, controls some parts of the country, while the capital is the seat of a UN-backed government. A showdown between Hafter’s army and the militias could plunge Libya into another spasm of violence, possibly the worst since the 2011 civil war. Yesterday, LNA forces took Gharyan, about 50 miles south of Tripoli after skirmishes with forces allied to Tripoli-based Prime Minister Fayez al-Serraj. Hafter then ordered his forces to march on the capital, saying in an audio recording posted online: ‘We are coming Tripoli, we are coming.’ He also urged his forces to enter the city peacefully and only raise their weapons ‘in the face of those who seek injustice and prefer confrontation and fighting.’ Trucks armed with heavy machine guns could be seen driving down the road in the remote region in the center of Libya as they made their way to Tripoli Forces loyal to Libyan strongman Khalifa Haftar patroling in downtown Sebha last month, the biggest city in southern Libya Hafter’s spokesman Ahmed al-Mesmari said later the army’s next stop would be the town of al-Aziziya, considered the gates of Tripoli. In response, the militias from the western cities of Zawiya and Misarata, which control Tripoli, posted on social media early Friday that they’re mobilising to confront Hafter. ‘We are the revolutionaries and the elders … we declare we are on full mobilization and war,’ they said. Militias allied to the Tripoli government moved more machinegun-mounted pickups from the coastal city of Misrata to Tripoli to defend it against Haftar’s forces. The escalation surprised the United Nations, whose Secretary-General Guterres had been in Tripoli this week to help organize a national reconciliation national conference planned for later this month. Soldiers from the self-styled army of Libyan Strongman Khalifa Haftar take part in a military parade in the eastern city of Benghazi in May last year A member of pro-internationally recognised government forces checks the confiscated military vehicles from Libyan commander Khalifa Haftar’s troops Guterres, who spent Thursday night in the heavily fortified U.N. compound in a Tripoli suburb, was flying to Benghazi on Friday to meet Haftar. He will also go to Tobruk, another eastern city, to meet lawmakers of the House of Representatives, which is also allied to Haftar. ‘My aim remains the same: avoid a military confrontation. I reiterate that there is no military solution for the Libyan crisis, only a political one,’ Guterres said on Twitter. Assembly President Aguila Saleh welcomed the offensive, a spokesman said. Haftar also enjoys the backing of Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, which see him as bulwark against Islamists and have supported him militarily, according to U.N. reports. Germany called an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council due to the military escalation. Russia said it was not helping Haftar’s forces and it supported a negotiated political settlement that ruled out any new bloodshed. ‘The situation should be resolved peacefully,’ Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. Former colonial power Italy, which lies across the Mediterranean from Libya, was very worried by the turn of events, Italian Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini said. ‘We need to throw water on the fire, not petrol on the fire. I hope that people, acting out of economic or business self-interest, is not looking for a military solution, which would be devastating,’ Salvini said. The United Nations and Western countries have been trying to mediate between Serraj and Haftar, who met in Abu Dhabi last month to discuss a power-sharing deal. The conference the United Nations is helping to organize is aimed at forging agreement on a road map for elections to resolve the prolonged instability in Libya, an oil producer and transit point for refugees and migrants trekking across the Sahara with the aim of reaching Europe. Libya since Gaddafi: How the country went from liberation to the brink of civil war Libya has been mired in chaos since the ouster and killing of dictator Colonel Gaddafi in 2011, with two rival authorities and a multitude of militias vying for control of the oil-rich country. Strongman Khalifa Haftar’s forces were pushed back Friday from a key checkpoint less than 30 kilometres (18 miles) from Tripoli, checking their lightning advance on the capital, seat of the country’s internationally recognised unity government. Haftar supports a parallel administration based in the east. Here is a timeline of the Mediterranean country’s descent into turmoil: Former dictator Colonel Gaddafi was the Libyan leader from 1969 until 2011. During the Libyan civil war the government was overthrown, and Gaddafi retreated to Sirte, only to be captured and killed Gaddafi killed Triggered by uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt, demonstrations erupt in Libya in February 2011. A coalition led by Washington, Paris and London lends its backing to an armed revolt. Gaddafi, in power for 42 years, flees the capital. He is captured and killed on October 20, 2011 during a battle for his hometown Sirte, east of Tripoli. Three days later, the rebel National Transitional Council (NTC) declares Libya’s ‘total liberation’. In August 2012 the NTC hands power to a transitional authority elected a month earlier – the General National Congress (GNC). Embassies targeted US ambassador Chris Stevens and three American staff are killed in a September 11, 2012 attack on their consulate in Libya’s second city Benghazi. An Al-Qaeda-linked jihadist group is blamed. A car bomb in April 2013 targets France’s embassy in Tripoli, wounding two French guards. Most foreign delegations withdraw from the country. Rival governments Dissident army general Haftar launches an offensive in May 2014 against jihadist groups in Benghazi. He is backed by Egypt and the United Arab Emirates. Several military officers from the east join his self-styled Libyan National Army. As nationalists and Islamists vie for power, legislative elections are held in June and the GNC is replaced by a parliament dominated by anti-Islamists. Islamist-led militias contest the results and group under the banner of ‘Fajr Libya’ (Libya Dawn). They storm Tripoli in August, installing their own ‘national salvation’ government and restoring the GNC. The elected house, which has international recognition, takes refuge in the eastern city of Tobruk near the border with Egypt. Thus the country finds itself with two governments and two parliaments. After months of negotiations and international pressure, lawmakers from the rival parliaments sign an accord in December 2015 in Morocco to set up a UN-backed Government of National Accord (GNA). In March 2016, GNA chief Fayez al-Sarraj arrives in Tripoli to set up the new government, but Haftar’s rival administration refuses to recognise its authority. Peace talks, armed groups In July 2017, Sarraj and Haftar meet for talks near Paris where they agree to a ceasefire and commit to elections the following year. In May 2018, weeks after suicide attackers from the Islamic State group kill 14 people at Libya’s electoral commission, the two men meet again in the French capital and commit to holding parliamentary and presidential polls at the end of the year. In June 2018, a militia attacks two northeastern oil sites under Haftar’s control through which oil is exported. After days of fighting, Haftar’s forces announce they are back in ‘full control’ and have also seized the city of Derna from radical Islamists. In January 2019 Haftar launches an offensive into oil-rich southern Libya, ostensibly aimed at wiping out ‘terrorists’ and criminal groups. His forces seize the region’s capital Sebha and one of the country’s main oil fields without a fight. Conferences On February 28 the UN says Libya’s rivals have met and agreed to hold polls. In March the UN says it will organise an all-party conference the next month to draw up a ‘road map’ for Libya, including setting dates for legislative and presidential elections. Later in March the African Union says it will host a ‘reconciliation’ conference in July aimed at uniting Libya’s political rivals. Advance on Tripoli On Wednesday, Haftar’s forces announce they are gearing up to move on the west of the country including Tripoli. A day later powerful armed groups from the western city of Misrata, loyal to the Tripoli government, vow to block the threatened advance. UN chief Antonio Guterres expresses deep concern over the risk of a major flare-up in Libya. Haftar orders his troops to advance on Tripoli, saying ‘the time has come’. The strongman’s forces seize a key security barrier within 27 kilometres of the capital later that day without any fighting, General Abdessalem al-Hassi says. But on Friday, a security source says militiamen from the nearby coastal town of Zawiya retake the base after ‘a short exchange of fire’. Advertisement"

April 5, 2019 Danger! Danger! With The Deep State On The Ropes, It’s ‘False Flag Season’ In America! Watch Out For Unprecedented Trickery And Diabolical Cover-Ups In The Days Ahead – The mainstream media see no evil, report no evil, and hear no evil…which is how they enable evil
By William B. Stoecker – All News Pipeline Save for Fox News and the internet (so far), America has no free press, only a mindless chorus of lying, slandering Demoncrap supporters. As Tucker Carlson and other truth-tellers have pointed out, the media have always had a leftist bias, but now they are all the way out of the closet and make no effort to hide it. Now, if someone helps to cover up murder and mass murder they are enabling more of the same, for the killers and others of their like will be emboldened to continue getting away with it. And the media, all along for decades, have covered up political assassinations, the murders of people too close to the truth, and false flag operations that have killed thousands.
And not only the media, but, infuriatingly, some police and other local government officials have destroyed evidence, allowed crimes to happen, and, in some cases, apparently participated in the murders. Consider this: if we peasants were able to see through the lies surrounding Dallas, OKC, and 9/11, major news outlets, with their connections and resources, certainly knew that we were all being lied to, as did the FBI and CIA leaders and major political leaders.
Yet, save for one good series, “ The Men Who Killed Kennedy ,” on the History Channel years ago, the media have been silent, and no sitting US President has told the American people the truth. The best Congress has been able to do was the half-hearted effort of the House Select Committee on Assassinations years ago, an effort that ended, not in a bang, but a whimper. And the slaughter and slow enslavement have continued. The people who could and should have stopped it are as guilty as if they had planted the bombs and pulled the triggers themselves.
(If you appreciate stories like this, please consider donating to ANP to help keep us in this battle for the future of America .)
Consider Dallas, the day when many of my generation “ lost our virginity ” so to speak, and began to see the horrible truth. Of course, our parents remembered the betrayal at Pearl Harbor, and their parents read of the sinking of the Lusitania…the lies didn’t begin with Dallas. I remember sitting in the university cafeteria with a group of my fellow USAF ROTC cadets, and the growing silence in the room as words came from the radio, words we could never forget. Initially I had no problem with the idea that a “ lone gunman ” might be able to kill JFK. But then came the word that the Dallas Police had captured Lee Harvey Oswald on the other side of the city and were charging him with the assassination…how so? Why were they so sure? And the hit was a near-impossible shot by a man never noted for marksmanship skill, despite having been a Marine.
Days later, the most important prisoner the Dallas Police had ever held was shot dead in their custody by a strip club owner they all knew, killed with one stomach wound he should have survived. And, later, we discovered that Jack Ruby was a low-level Mob associate, from San Giancana’s Chicago, Giancana, who had dated a JFK lady friend and who had almost certainly helped JFK win the needed votes in corrupt Cook County. Film footage of the JFK killing seems to show that the shot came from the front, the grassy knoll area, and not from Oswald’s alleged “ sniper’s nest ” in the School Book Depository.
And the SS had changed the planned motorcade route at the last minute so that JFK would pass under the one building in the entire metro area where his alleged assassin just happened to work. And many people associated with Oswald died mysteriously, including White Russian émigré George de Mohrenschildt, an alleged “ right winger ” who had befriended alleged communist Oswald. And Oswald had served with the USMC on a U-2 base, defected to the USSR, and was allowed to return after becoming disillusioned with the workers’ paradise, yet continued to be a communist…how so, if he was so disillusioned? And de Mohrenshildt, “ suicided” just before he was to be questioned about Dallas, had shadowy intelligence connections, and knew many major players in the US, including Jacqueline Bouvier and George (Bush) I. JFK was shot on 11/22, adding up to 33, and they shot him in Dallas, within a degree of the thirty third parallel…as in thirty third degree Freemason.
Investigative reporters like Danny Casolaro and Gary Webb die at an alarming rate here in the good old USA, and often under very odd circumstances. Casolaro began investigating the alleged theft of software by the US government, and ended investigating the Deep State in general and allegedly slashing his wrists multiple times. He had many documents but we will never know what, if anything, they might have proved…for they vanished when he “ suicided .” Gary Webb claimed that the US government was selling drugs in US cities and was killed by two allegedly self-inflicted head shots…who shoots himself in the head twice?
Local police and coroners had to have been involved at least in the cover-ups in both cases. Investigative reporter Andrew Breitbart walked out of an LA bar near his home on 3/1/12 and suddenly dropped dead, allegedly due to a heart attack. Another conservative reporter, Michael Hastings, was driving his car down an LA street 6/28/13 when it exploded in a huge fireball after allegedly striking a tree at nearly 100 miles per hour…but Hastings was not known for such recklessness as driving at high speed on city streets. And the mass media see no evil, speak no evil, and hear no evil…which is how they enable evil.
Yet we peasants have learned to take note of any strange occurrences, like the two teenage boys found dead and decapitated on the railroad tracks in 1987 near Mena, Arkansas. Only later did we learn that cocaine was being flown into Mena, while George I and, later, George II ruled in DC and Slick Willy in Arkansas. So maybe Gary Webb was right all along. And no one has left a trail of corpses to match the achievements of the Demonic Duo Slick and the Witch. Vince Foster, Mary Mahoney and her co-workers, Ron Brown and a planeload of people, all these and many, many more who were too close to the Clintons, all died under mysterious circumstances, noted by us commoners and ignored by our masters. Seth Rich of the DNC was one of the latest.
And the political assassinations didn’t stop with JFK, RFK, MLK, and the George Wallace shooting. Ask Supreme Court justice Scalia, found dead in a hunting lodge with a pillow placed over his face.
It was the Clintons who sent the intrepid heroes of the FBI and BATF to root the dreaded Branch Davidians from their “compound” near Waco, Texas. About eighty people, including some twenty children and infants, were massacred, at Waco, mostly by being burned alive. The federales kept changing their story as to why they had besieged the “compound” to begin with, trying child abuse, for which there was no evidence and which is not the business of the federal government. Some of us think that burning children alive might constitute child abuse, but what do we know? The feds also floated illicit drugs and illegal firearms, but never bothered to produce any evidence, not even fake evidence. The media were mildly critical and soon moved on.
The bombing of the Murrah Building in Oklahoma City, also on Slick’s watch, produced such charming details as a row of dead babies lying on broken glass, a woman who had to have her arm amputated without anesthetic to free her from the rubble, and a man who lost most of his close family members and was blinded for life. A USAF explosives expert has testified that the ammonium nitrate truck bomb, powerful though it was, could not have done that much damage…and a seismic center picked up the sound of two explosions.
The intrepid heroes of the BATF had an office in the building, yet, incredibly, no one was holding down the fort…they were all safely out of the building. Not only have they never explained this; BATF spokesmouths lied and claimed they were in the building saving lives, until they were caught in the lie…and they have never bothered to explain this. The government nearly lost their case against Timothy McVey because they refused to call all the witnesses who saw him in the company of a mysterious man of Middle Eastern appearance. And McVey had definite links to the Nazis of Elohim City, near the Arkansas border…and Mena. There’s more, much more, but the bombing provided an excuse for a further expansion of government police powers.
But, in fact, there are “ unanswered questions ” around every one of America’s bombings and mass shootings, all of which have served as excuses for increases of federal government power and attacks on the Second Amendment rights of us peasants, despite the fact that the shootings are usually in “ gun free zones ,” where the victims have been disarmed. At Columbine High School the police arrived on scene…and then just sat there, mighty warriors that they are, and let more students die. This pattern would be repeated at Parkland High School, where Sheriff Scott Israel was the chief law enforcement officer, and who is a friend of the ‘ Witch Hillary ‘. A mysterious man was taped running through the woods next to the Sandy Hook school where so many children were shot…or were they? This is but one of the odd facts that cluster around this event.
The Boston Marathon bombing photos depict at least one man with limbs blown off, but he is fully conscious, sitting upright, and has lost very little blood. This is no more believable than the rest of the scenario given us by the government and the media, but the bombing gave the police an excuse to kick people’s doors in without a search warrant and then drive whole families of innocent citizens from their homes and even to hold them at gunpoint. As for the Las Vegas mass shooting, there is no way one man with an inaccurate bump stock, given the distance to his targets, could have killed and wounded so many before the bulk of his intended victims escaped or found cover. And motive was lacking, and the police, as is their custom, took their own sweet time responding. There’s more, but google it and see for yourselves.
As for 9/11, in all the history of steel framed buildings, not a one ever completely collapsed due to fire…until 9/11, when both towers fell. And they fell straight down, a feat unattainable save though the controlled detonation of pre-placed charges. As for Building Seven, it had but a small fire, but the lease holder said they should “ pull ” the building, and pull it they did, with another controlled demolition, collapsing it straight down in its own footprint…three buildings in one day. The planes of NORAD did nothing while all these terrible events took place over a considerable period of time, and an airliner allegedly hit the Pentagon with mind-boggling precision, hitting the exact base of the first floor. The wings and engines would have hit the outside of the Pentagon, a building 60 years old to the day on 9/11, yet little damage was done, and the wings and engines vanished off the face of the Earth. But then, so did the rest of the disappearing airliner, its passengers, and its crew. No mention is made and no pictures were ever produced of wreckage and burned body parts.
I predict that the false flags and assassinations will continue, and the media lies and cover-ups, and the useful idiots will steadfastly continue to believe anything except the truth. If there is ever to be justice here in the ruins of our late, great Republic, it will have to be of the DIY variety.

"America’s missed climate targets cost global economy $1 trillion, Dublin-based think tank finds",www.therussophile.org,Sharon Kelly,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/americas-missed-climate-targets-cost-global-economy-1-trillion-dublin-based-think-tank-finds.html/,"This post was originally published on this site
Since 1992, the United States consistently has missed its targets for reducing globe-warming emissions, and a Dublin-based think tank estimates the resulting damage to the global economy has been $1 trillion.
The U.S. polluted far more – 20 billion tons of CO2 worth – than American negotiators said it would during repeated rounds of global climate deals, including Rio in 1992, Kyoto in 1997, Copenhagen in 2009, and Paris in 2015, a report published by the Institute of International and European Affairs (IIEA) today concludes.
“This is not because the agreed targets were too ambitious or costly to meet,” IIEA wrote. “On the contrary: U.S. negotiators were highly successful in incorporating U.S. preferences into agreements, and targets were eminently achievable; but the costs have been vastly exaggerated by industry-funded studies.”
The researchers pointed to history to illustrate the gap between projections produced by industry on the costs of environmental laws versus the costs that resulted once those laws were adopted. “For example,” they wrote, “before the Clean Air Act, industry claimed that the cost of sulphur reduction would be $1,500 per ton, whereas the final cost was $1.50 per ton.” U.S. climate progress “critically insufficient”
Building on data from the Climate Action Tracker , which analyzes countries’ progress toward international climate goals, the authors examined the difference between U.S. greenhouse gas pollution and the expectations American negotiators agreed to during global climate summits. With government #ParisAgreement commitments, global warming in 2100 will be 3.0˚C – twice the agreed 1.5˚C limit. With current policies, it’ll be higher, at 3.3˚C. We have just released our annual update at #COP24 https://t.co/zVAyGYi8Zo pic.twitter.com/qmoumOpnh0
— ClimateActionTracker (@climateactiontr) December 11, 2018
Climate Action Tracker ranks the U.S. alongside Russia, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Ukraine as “ critically insufficient ” and “not at all consistent with holding warming to well below 2° Celsius let alone with the Paris Agreement’s stronger 1.5°C limit.”
The new report predicts that between 2018 and 2025, the U.S. will pollute 5 billion more tons of greenhouse gases than it said it would under the Paris Agreement, which the U.S. remains a party to, even though the Trump administration has said it will initiate an exit at the first opportunity, which arrives at the end of 2019.
“By late 2016, President Obama believed his administration had ‘transformed the United States into a global leader in the fight against climate change,’ because the U.S. was then on track to meet its internationally-agreed targets,” the report said. “This moment has now passed.” The “Trump effect”

The IIEA highlighted the role that the Trump administration has played in accelerating climate change.
“Emissions growth resumed in 2018 amid the Trump administration’s single-minded determination to roll back Obama-era climate protections,” said IIEA author Joseph Curtin, “and the prospect of meeting this pledge has quietly receded.”
In December 2018, the IIEA made international headlines with a report , also authored by Curtin, that described a “Trump effect” that “applied a brake” to the world’s efforts to meet the Paris targets by making fossil fuel investments more attractive, providing “moral and political cover” for other countries that also fall short and damaging mutual goodwill at international negotiations.
Today’s report cites a 2016 U.S. federal study for estimates that “a tonne of emissions would cause $42 worth of economic damage in 2020,” which results in the IIEA’s $1 trillion conclusion. The report adds that “costs could be many orders of magnitude higher.”
The new report points to three factors in American politics that have created an impasse on climate: partisanship, Senate procedural rules that allow fossil fuel advocates to play an obstructionist role, and the role of “special interests” like the fossil fuel industry. Role of American politics

The Dublin-based think tank takes a rather reductionist view of American politics, crediting Democrats with supporting action “whereas Republicans do not.”
That doesn’t reflect the full historical track record of many prominent Democrats – for example, the Obama administration oversaw the spread of shale gas drilling and fracking nationwide and adopted what it called an “all of the above” energy strategy that included explicit support for coal, oil, gas, and renewables. And when it comes to the American public, both Republicans and Democrats supported more renewable energy and said the government wasn’t acting strongly enough on climate change, a Pew survey reported by Gizmodo found a year ago.
More recently, however, the Green New Deal proposed by Senator Ed Markey and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, both Democrats, represents a shift towards a much stronger U.S. response to climate change.

“We are facing a national crisis,” Rep. Ocasio-Cortez said on the House floor on March 26, remarks captured in a video that’s garnered over 15 million views. “And if we do not ascend to that crisis – if we do not ascend to the levels in which we were threatened at the Great Depression, when we were threatened in World War II – if we do not ascend to those levels, if we tell the American public that we are more willing to invest and bail out big banks than we are willing to invest in our farmers and our urban families, then I don’t know what we’re here doing.” On the legal hook?
Beyond internal American politics, the IIEA’s report hints at the possibility of an international response to American inaction. It describes three legal implications from the $1 trillion in damages they calculated, writing that possibilities included legal action in the International Court of Justice, domestic lawsuits in the U.S. against state or federal regulators, and lawsuits against major American polluters.
The report adds that prospects for successful litigation “remain low” at this time, but describes global trends that could raise odds of legal action in the future, including “promising legal precedents in Europe, and the number of lawsuits before U.S. courts.”
“Three decades of climate history suggests that a window of opportunity for legislation – be it delivering a green new deal, a carbon fee, or an alternative approach – will eventually open again,” said Curtin. “If this does not happen in 2021, the focus will again turn to litigation.”
“Someone, somewhere, at some time,” he added, “will eventually pay the price.” SHARE

‘Best president’ now really deserves Mt. Rushmore,www.therussophile.org,Robert S. Becker,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/best-president-now-really-deserves-mt-rushmore.html/,"This post was originally published on this site Executive Order #456: Spread the Gospel
The increasingly White House of Trump hereby declares April Presidential Liberation Month. The great Mueller via the even greater Barr have made history: free at last, we single-handedly fought against the sham coup attempt. The worst spent money in human history. The witch hunt is dead; long live the witch, whatever that means. This heroic, martyred president is now confirmed as more than not guilty but totally innocent, like a babe in the woods. And what red-blooded, real man wouldn’t love a babe way out in the woods.
Wonder at our unrivaled accomplishments, surpassing all other mortal presidents. We whipped ‘em at the ballot box, mainly the Electoral College score – and without California voting fraud would have won the popularity contest, too. We beat ‘em back on the Wall, already growing like Topsy, whoever that is. We beat ‘em on the Muslim Ban – so not one Islamic terrorist had dared attack true Americans on my watch. Desperadoes understand the full retribution an empowered warrior president will inflict on those who even think of bombing us.
So many say we’re having a great presidency, some say the greatest. Of course our staff helps, however much they need correction when undermining our stable genius, notable with our every triumphant tariff and foreign policy move. Has any president assembled more exemplary, “best” leaders, like Mike Pence, Wilbur Ross or Ryan Zinke? We hesitate to claim God put us in office but for sure He’s back on America’s side again. And He’s definitely a He, no gender nonsense please. God, not Russian interference, not fake collusion, is our source and inspiration. By the way, that’s why dumb critics and Democrat traitors say we move in mysterious ways, through a glass darkly, whatever that means. Alongside God, why shouldn’t we work in mysterious ways, as least when perceived by dullards?
Mueller redeemed himself, showing true patriotic stripes: only a fellow genius could affirm once and for all: no collusion, no obstruction, no wrongdoing. Instead of slander about being a “foreign asset,” whatever that means, we should instead be canonized as a champion of probity and fortitude. How can the best president ever, guardian of the people and just enforcer of law, be anything else? Mueller’s report commits all weak, envious purveyors of lies to the tortures of Hell – fair justice for routed losers.
The White House is thrilled to confirm how often we actually told the truth when forever denying collusion. Not only zero collusion with Russia but even less with Saudi Arabia or North Korea or Turkey either – or any pals who approve prime downtown Trump Towers locations. Or maybe an upscale golf course – whatever my dutiful sons propose while we public servants toil for the people, practically uninvolved. My kids’ religion is ti followmy orders, as so few children match their father’s genius.
Time to abolish all fake news, like incredible lies about my healthy male sex drive. Anybody who knows me knows this top gun would never have to pay for sex because fame and power draws beautiful women to alpha males like hair spray to my hair. Ditto, all that trash about alleged dicey business dealings, insurance dealings, bank dealings, even embarrassing bankruptcies. Count up our assets and bank accounts: who amasses ten billion dollars, give or take a million, without being fair, honest and smart? Trust me, if you ever read our tax returns, you’d see only truth, justice and the American way.
And never forgot my two favorite, loyal women, displaying regard for younger, attractive women we haven’t slept with. But not because they’re not as hot than Melania – nobody beats my exotic beauty queen. Anyway, there’s brilliant Kelly Ann Conjob, the only advisor I don’t scream at daily. She gets what this great leader needs: total, unblinking, unquestioned endorsement. It’s not like we’ve ever been wrong. Did you hear last week’s home run: “if President Trump isn’t already our Best President Ever, give him another year. Then all will be revealed: how his radical changes to American leadership put him in a class by himself.”
Hear our matching PR wizard, Sarah Huckster Huckster, speaking on FUX TV: “Look, politics is a dog-eat-dog world, and nobody messes with this head press honcho. Sometimes you have bang heads and fake news never ends. Trust me, I know. This president is a street-fighter, a man of the people who’s honed his nuanced skills when fixing beauty contests or writing up golf scores. He sets the tone: we only win when everyone else loses. Works for us.”
The true genius of our White House, believe me, is we make people think we’re losing when we’re really winning. When we ruff up frauds like McCain, we become the real, populist maverick. Ditto, we don’t have to be racist or bigoted to realize how many white supremacist/NRA/evangelical/government-hating voters there are. Likewise, bragging about not paying taxes: true Americans know you don’t feed the corrupt rascals out to get you. And what’s wrong with going bankrupt – it’s legal – and you can still sneak cash out the back door. You think our great fans judge us for picking up a few bucks at our hotels because we won an election? They’d all do it in a Washington minute if they had my smarts. Winners know when to cash in, exiting while losers whine about “the rules.” Winners make their own rules, caring little about the means. There are only ends.
Greatness will out – and it would be sadder than sad if Mt. Rushmore placement didn’t crown our legacy. Sure, make space for Reagan, the one other modern, paradigm-shifting president. But he only started the crusade, identifying government as the problem. We finished it, turning government into the flagrant enemy of freedom. Yes, we’re take on the Federal Reserve when they defy true economic genius. Count the agencies we crippled or wiped out, the anti-business regulations dead and buried, the right-thinking judges in key places. Plus, we’re totally responsible for no new wars, no oil embargoes, no recessions – with stocks up and up. We could still do 5% annual growth if we could crush the disloyal, obstructionist House.
Shouldn’t the greatest of the great reap the greatest rewards? First monument: a huge re-election triumph, with a big popular vote margin to correct ’16 fraud. Second, a national PR consensus to put our face and hair on Mt. Rushmore. Why shouldn’t the greatest builder of his generation, perhaps any generation – the only never elected guy to take the White House – warrant top billing among the pantheon of heroes?
Those who knew our great father, Fred, aren’t surprised his amazing son topped all charts. Though he passed on before seeing the family name entrenched at the glitziest real estate of all, he provided the essential seed money. So, not only do we individually deserve Mt. Rushmore, the Trump family merits this historic engraving set off below: “Trump now, Trump tomorrow, Trump forever.” That’s what winning is all about. That’s what makes America great – and the Trump clan is greater than ever. Hey, maybe Mt. Rushmore isn’t enough acclaim. SHARE

Same In Europe We are seeing the same in Europe. The unelected and unaccountable EU elite is using any means to control all EU countries by undemocratic means. They have interfered in Greece, Italy, Denmark, Ireland, etc, by deceit and coercion and now they are doing it in the UK. Brussels is using all means possible to frustrate the democratic decision of the British people to leave the EU. The weak UK Prime Minister is facilitating their task.
The BIS (Bank of International Settlements) in Basel is doing the same with the monetary system. They, together with the IMF, are planning to introduce digital currencies instead of conventional money in order to achieve total control of money by turning on or off a switch. They are also, with a new digital currency, trying to obfuscate the fact that the world is bankrupt.
In The End In the end, manipulation and false markets created by the elite will fail. There is no other way out due to the sheer weight of the debt. Thus, sadly it will all end as a final and total catastrophe of the financial system.

WREXIT: Premeditated Sabotage of Brexit Proceeds with Full Force,www.therussophile.org,The Millennium Report,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/wrexit-premeditated-sabotage-of-brexit-proceeds-with-full-force.html/,"This post was originally published on this site Brexit: “The People Have Spoken – The Bastards”
ZeroHedge.com
The whole brouhaha around Brexit has amply demonstrated the under-hand tactics used by the losing side post-2016 referendum. There seems no dirty trick that the PTB and their useful idiots will not employ in their ongoing campaign to keep the UK in the prison of the EU and keep the sinking ship of the EU afloat.
The counter-revolution campaign contained of 4 discrete but interconnected segments. Project fear : This was successfully used in the Scottish Independence Referendum and has been rolled out again in an attempt to reverse the Leave vote in UK’s EU referendum campaign. After the Leave vote result, media immediately went into (hysterical) overdrive with its tales of woe and chaos regarding the ‘inevitable’ collapse of the UK economy. Visions were conjured up of empty super-market shelves, mass unemployment, capital flight, food riots etcetera. The end of civilization as we know it. A notable example of conjecture and scare-mongering being presented as hard ‘facts.’ Disinformation : The ‘experts’ from the political and media class assured us that life in the EU was wonderful and full of promise and if we only gave it a little more time it would become a veritable Shangri la. Enter stage left : the great and the good from the pseudo-left, social-democratic establishment, overwhelmingly in the case of the Labour party, who have assured us that the EU could be transformed – when all the evidence pointed to the contrary – and become an instrument of progress, prosperity and enlightenment. This policy was given broader exposure with Diem2025 the brainchild of one Yanis Varoufakis. According to the theory, nation states no longer existed, and reforms should start at the supra-national level. But as a matter of fact, the nation-state is precisely the arena which meaningful politics can and does take place. According to the Remain and Reform school, we apparently need a Europe-wide supra-national strategy – based upon what policies exactly? We must assume, according to the party line, that the nation-state is either dead or dying, this being an article of faith of the globalist left and the Washington Consensus. Strange bedfellows? Confusion : When the population has been softened-up and generally addled by the non-stop propaganda offensive waged by the media – private and state – they will tend to opt for the status quo. Clinging on to the wet-nurse in fear of something new and untested. A second vote is to now been mooted by the PTB, spuriously designated the ‘peoples’ vote, as if the first Referendum somehow wasn’t – and this has been massively endorsed by the Labour party membership and pretty much universally by the PLP. Ergo, the policy the ‘left internationalists’ is one of inter alia ‘strengthening democracy’ – all very noble.
However, the crucially important issue of the neo-liberal policy tripod: the three freedoms of movement – capital, labour, commodities – remains in place, political change will not take place. And provided the institutional infrastructure of globalized capitalism – the IMF, WTO, World Bank, the EU – are overseeing and enabling the EU’s neoliberal project, economic and political change will not take place.
It is not the shackles of nationalism that give rise to the bureaucratic monstrosity which is the EU but precisely the opposite. The neo-liberal imperatives of open borders, liberalized commodity markets, liberalized capital accounts, abandonment of exchange rate controls, flexible labour markets and freedom of movement of labour, provide the theoretical and political under-pinning of the whole structure. Unless these political/ideological roadblocks are addressed the status quo will continue and continue to deteriorate.
In terms of alliance building, political convergence between states cannot be constructed at regional (for example the EU) or even less so at global levels even if it is not achieved firstly at the level of nations. Because whether we like it or not, nations define and manage concrete realities and challenges, and it is only at these levels that changes in the social and political balance of forces to the advantage of the popular classes will or will not occur. Changes at the regional and global level may reflect national advances and certainly facilitate them – but nothing more. In short the move is from local to national and finally to supra-national, not the other way around.
In order to stop the onward march of globalist neoliberalism governments and states must regain control of their economies and politics. There is no single way to achieve this critical goal, but without it hemispheric co-operation will remain little more than an empty rhetorical flourish. Moreover, everywhere electorates are looking to governments to be a counterweight to footloose corporations. It is this intuitive perception to rein-in markets that will increasingly occupy centre-stage between pro and anti the coming decade. For social-political movements the nation-state continues to be the chosen instrument for the organization of society. It cannot be any other way. However much social institutions will have to adapt to new global pressures, what is not in doubt is that the nation-state remains the crucible for equality seeking movements the world over. Efficiency, profitability and competitiveness have not won the hearts and minds of the peoples worldwide, nor are they likely to do so; precisely the opposite in fact.
Reform of the EU, which I understand to be the goal of the campaign of pro-EU aligned leftist faction fails to take into consideration the fact that the EU cannot be reformed since its whole ideological structure and constitution is built upon neo-liberal technocratic assumptions which can clearly be identified in the interior belief-systems of the bureaucracy, and consequently the daily practise and deliberations of internal institutions explicitly designed on a neoliberal model and cemented by legal statutes have made such changes impossible.
But such reasoned arguments were ignored by the Remainer berserkers, as they screeched: ‘’Smash the whole EU referendum farce with a second referendum.” The ‘farce’ meaning of course an outcome which the Remainers didn’t like. Well of course this is pretty much par for the course for EU electoral practise: If at first you don’t succeed, then simply repeat the playbook instructions until you get the right result, which is to say the result which suits the political/economic status quo.
Regardless of the pros and cons of EU membership I don’t think I have ever seen such a blatant attempt at the repudiation of universal suffrage as this. It seems to have now become fashionable and acceptable to question the whole basis of democratic electoral practise with the soi-disant elite – the elite which leads from the rear – actually openly questioning the validity of what it took a hundred years to establish, from 1832 until 1928.
I didn’t particularly like it when the Tories were elected in 1979, 1983,1987, 1992 and 2015 but I never and ceteris paribus, never would have questioned the legitimacy of their electoral triumph. Perhaps we should have staged a coup, Ukrainian style, and overthrown the democratically elected government and then had another election, come to think of it why bother with elections at all, after all you might lose.
There seems to be a real problem with left Remainers, including the soft-lefts which incidentally didn’t even allow a discussion on the issue. But democracy is not a la carte. Mess with the system and you open up a Pandora’s Box of baleful possibilities. Possibly and at some future date an election which returns a candidate/party to their liking may also be repudiated. In which case where do you go from there? Answer nowhere since it was always a possibility after the initial precedent had been established; and when election results become merely provisional or advisory, then genuine democracy is hollowed out and becomes a ritual, part of the political spectacle which in no way challenges the structures of power and privilege.
Universal suffrage and electoral practise are not conditional they are absolute. Democracy is table d’hôtel or it is nothing. The Remainer bloc seem to have undergone three identifiable ‘moments’ (see below) in their fury of not getting their own way.
Moment 1. Bertolt Brecht made the point after the East Germany rising in 1953, that the Communist government complained that they had done so much for the people and how ungrateful the people were. Brecht’s acerbic reply was that “the people should be dissolved and another elected.” That was the Remainers Brechtian moment. Bronze medal .
Moment 2 came the Augustian moment. St. Augustine who intoned: “Lord give me chastity and celibacy but not yet.” Translated into Remainerspeak it would read: Lord give me invocation of article 50, but not yet. Silver Medal .
Moment 3. Finally, there was the Richard Tuck moment: “The people have spoken, the bastards.” –Dick Tuck and American politician’s concession speech following his loss in the 1966 California State Senate election “The people have spoken, the bastards.” Gold Medal .
Gold medal therefore to be awarded to the Remainers for their characterisation of the Leave vote – some 17.4 million of the electorate – as ‘bastards’.

BOOM! Smollett Being Sued by Chicago Police Department,www.therussophile.org,State of the Nation,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/boom-smollett-being-sued-by-chicago-police-department.html/,"This post was originally published on this site

Chicago police were livid when the state’s attorney, Kim Foxx, dropped a 16-felony-count indictment against “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett for faking his own hate crime, and were further incensed when the actor, who forfeited his $10,000 bail, refused to reimburse the department for the $130,000 in overtime it paid out to officers investigating his case.
And we imagine Maxine Waters’ insistence that dropping the charges was “the correct thing to do” didn’t make them feel any better. So, in the interest of trying to maintain some semblance of the notion that justice was served, the PD has said it will sue Smollett for the overtime costs, according to Reuters .
Bill McCaffrey, a spokesman for the city’s Department of Law, said late Thursday that the lawsuit was being prepared.
“Mr. Smollett has refused to reimburse the City of Chicago for the cost of police overtime spent investigating his false police report on January 29, 2019,” McCaffrey said. “The Law Department is now drafting a civil complaint that will be filed in the Circuit Court of Cook Country.”
Smollett was charged in February with hiring two Nigerian-born brothers with whom he was friendly to stage a hate crime back in January. At the time, Smollett claimed that he was attacked by two white men who screamed “this is MAGA country!” before beating him, tying a noose around his neck and pouring bleach on him. After prosecutors dropped the charges, a Chicago judge sealed Smollett’s case file – which one police source later said was “eight inches thick” – something the states’ attorney’s office said it didn’t ask for.
The decision to drop the charges infuriated the police and outgoing mayor Rahm Emmanuel.
Earlier this week, a group of some 300 people, including off-duty officers, took to the streets to demand an explanation, and that Foxx resign, as the FBI continued to investigate the decision to drop the charges. Foxx had recused herself from the case before the charges were dropped after it was revealed that she had exchanged texts with one of Smollett’s relatives. Adding to the air of conspiracy, a former Obama administration official reportedly tried to have Smollett’s case transferred from the Chicago PD to the FBI, but was told to pound sand.

ON THE OUTS: What are US-Puppet Guaido’s Next Steps?,www.therussophile.org,Paul Antonopoulos,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/on-the-outs-what-are-us-puppet-guaidos-next-steps.html/,"This post was originally published on this site
CARACAS – Venezuela has announced the initiation of criminal proceedings against self-proclaimed President Juan Guaidó. Political scientist Leonid Krutakov explains the possible development variants of the situation.
According to the head of the Legislation Committee of the Constituent Assembly, Julio García Serpa, the judicial process will be conducted by the Supreme Court and the country’s attorney general.
On Wednesday, the president of the Constituent Assembly, Diosdado Cabello, explained that the continuation of the investigation process against Guaidó, which had been approved the day before, would mean withdrawing the parliamentary immunity of the opposition leader.
“When two centers of power are created, we have a pre-revolutionary situation. If the official center does not react to that and does not stop it in some way, it will win the alternative center. Everyone understands who is behind Guaidó – to undertake harsh measures against him means the worsening of relations with the United States,” said the political scientist. – Advertisement –
“As soon as he [Guaidó] is arrested, the US will react hard, Venezuela will be surrounded, and the troops and the Navy will be moved to the border. This problem should have been resolved immediately,” said the expert.
According to him, the oppositionist will not hide from the investigation in other countries.
“If Guaidó escapes, it will be his and the USA’s defeat. I think he will be forced to go to Venezuela and continue his activities. Otherwise it will be the end of the game – they will create a government in exile, drag it by a long time, give the gold reserves to him. And this will be a game of exhaustion,” he concluded.
Mass protests against current Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro began on January 21. After the riots, Guaidó declared himself acting president and several Western countries, led by the USA, announced their recognition.
Russia, China and some other countries support Maduro as the legitimate president of Venezuela.

The European Commission announced the provision of initial financial assistance to Iran to overcome the effects of the largest floods in the country in recent decades. Brussels allocates 1.2 million euros, according to the Iranian news agency Tasnim on April 5.
Emergency funding will be directed to the most vulnerable communities in Iran, the EU executive said.
The EU Commissioner for Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Management, Christ Stylianidis, said that “at present, the EU is fully in solidarity with the Iranian people and will help provide substantial support in the affected areas.”
Assistance will be distributed with the assistance of humanitarian organizations, including the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. – Advertisement –
While rescue teams are involved in flood-hit areas, US sanctions have blocked all Iran’s Red Crescent accounts and banned Tehran from receiving foreign assistance, including rescue helicopters, Tasnim notes.
As reported by EADaily , Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif on April 2 condemned the United States’ sanctions pressure on the Islamic Republic, which impedes Tehran’s efforts to overcome the consequences of large-scale flooding in the country. According to the Iranian Foreign Minister, the actions of the American side are an example of “economic terrorism.”
Recall that heavy rains began on March 20 in most regions of Iran, which led to sudden floods in the northern provinces of Golestan and Mazandaran, as well as the flooding of cities and villages in the south-west of the Islamic Republic, where there were no casualties. Flooding in twenty-five of the 31 provinces of Iran, according to the latest official data, claimed the lives of 67 people.
On March 26, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani called on civil defense services, including as part of the country’s armed forces and Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), to mobilize all resources to lower the water level in the settlements in the flood zone."

MOSCOW – During the meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Angolan counterpart João Lourenço, held yesterday, the two leaders have shown their commitment to expand bilateral cooperation in various fields.
Russia hopes to promote bilateral relations with Angola, including in the areas of diamond extraction, fisheries and space , said President Vladimir Putin during a meeting with Angolan counterpart João Lourenço.
“There are interesting areas such as diamond mining, fishing and space,” Putin said on Thursday. “ Angola is a reliable and long-standing partner, and we need to look at what needs to be done in the near future to intensify economic-trade cooperation .”
The Russian president stressed that the two countries also have perspectives on humanitarian cooperation, for example in the preparation of personnel. – Advertisement –
João Lourenço was also keen to expand bilateral cooperation with Russia.
“ This is why yesterday I spoke at the opening of the Angola-Russia business forum here in Moscow to raise interest in Russian entrepreneurs to invest in the Republic of Angola – to diversify our economy ,” said Lourenço.
Putin invited Lourenço to participate in the Russia-Africa forum, which will be held in the Russian city of Sochi on October 24. The Angolan president, for his part, thanked and accepted the invitation.
The meeting between the Russian and Angolan leaders was held as part of João Lourenço’s official visit to Russia. Earlier, the two leaders had met in July 2018 during the BRICS summit in the South African city of Johannesburg. The Russian president highlighted the political and air security cooperation between the two countries, as well as the prospects for joint projects that could increase trade between Angola and Russia.
Lourenço said that he counts on a deeper economic cooperation with Russia, emphasizing that Russian companies are already present in the extractive industry of his country and he is hopeful that other spheres of the Angolan economy gain Russian notoriety.

Protecting Julian Assange: A Must for People of Conscience,www.therussophile.org,Kim Petersen,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/protecting-julian-assange-a-must-for-people-of-conscience.html/,"This post was originally published on this site
A high level source within the Ecuadorian state has told Wikileaks that Julian Assange will be expelled within ‘hours to days.’ — WikiLeaks on Twitter.
The Mueller investigation of an alleged collusion between Donald Trump and Russia to influence the outcome of the 2016 presidential election has come to its drawn-out end — or not. US monopoly media reported incessantly on the affair, dubbed Russiagate, despite the paucity of evidence.
The monopoly media has apparently learned little from its misreporting of the possession of WMD by the Saddam Hussein government in Iraq. The wording “alleged” was absent from the reporting as were the WMD in Iraq. Nonetheless, such monopoly media reporting of alleged acts as though they were facts has continued over the use of poison gas by the Assad government in Syria and an assassination attempt on the Skripals in England, attributed to Russian agents. Having not learned, the New York Times and Washington Post seek to perpetuate the Mueller “ Witch Hunt ,” as Trump has ridiculed it.
In an age when educational institutions call for sharpening critical thinking skills, the corporate and state media scribes show a paucity of critical thinking. It should be apparent that when a journalist, anchor, reporter reports on a claim one has an immediate first duty to verify factuality by demanding evidence to back any claims. Do these media people purchase bridges in Brooklyn without checking the deed of ownership?
This media disinformation can have serious consequences, even criminal or genocidal consequences. The monopoly media was heavily complicit in bolstering the US government rush-to-war , basing its reporting on false stories and dubious sources. The war which claimed perhaps upwards of a million Iraqi lives [1] was argued to be a genocide by Abdul Haq al-Ani and Tarik al-Ani in their legal tour de force : Genocide in Iraq: The Case against the UN Security Council and Member States (Clarity Press). In their book, the authors make known the destruction of critical infrastructure (e.g., Iraqi power systems, roads, railroads, and domestic petroleum production) and the commission of war crimes (e.g., bombing civilian defense shelters) by the US and its collaborators. [2]
Wikileaks published evidence of the war crimes carried out in Iraq when it released the “ Collateral Murder ” video of US military in an US Apache helicopter shooting an unarmed group of adults and children.
Julian Assange is the founder of Wikileaks, and as such has been identified as an enemy of the governmental-media-military industrial complex. Sexual allegations were raised against Assange in Sweden, but he was never charged, and the case was closed by Sweden. Assange was on record as willing to go to Sweden and face the allegations, but he could not receive a guarantee that he would not be turned over to the United States. Britain keeps him confined to the Ecuadorian Embassy, what a United Nations panel calls “arbitrary detention,” with the threat of arrest and likely extradition.
I wrote an article last summer that cited reports that Ecuador’s president Lenín Moreno was about to renege on asylum that the government of previous Ecuadorian president Rafael Correa had granted Assange.
Now the specter of Assange being evicted from the Ecuadorian embassy is again at the forefront of news. The Associated Press wrote that Moreno complained that WikiLeaks was intercepting his communications and invading his privacy. Importantly, AP noted that Moreno provided no evidence for his claims.
Wikileaks issued a tweet :
“BREAKING: A high level source within the Ecuadorian state has told @WikiLeaks that Julian Assange will be expelled within “hours to days” using the #INAPapers offshore scandal as a pretext–and that it already has an agreement with the UK for his arrest.” BREAKING: A high level source within the Ecuadorian state has told @WikiLeaks that Julian Assange will be expelled within “hours to days” using the #INAPapers offshore scandal as a pretext–and that it already has an agreement with the UK for his arrest. https://t.co/adnJph79wq
— WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) April 4, 2019
Assange’s “great crime” is revealing the crimes of US empire. War is peace. And revealing the crimes of Empire is deemed criminal by Empire.
Others, not beholden to Empire, but followers-of-conscience are indebted to Assange who as a publisher, performed a massive service to humanity by informing people about acts their governments are involved in, support, or are silent about. WikiLeaks respects “our” right to know. It allows us to know of corruption and criminality in our governments so that society can organize to denounce and put an end to such corruption and criminality.
Nobel Peace Prize laureate Mairead Maguire recognized such service when she wrote the Nobel Peace Committee to nominate Assange:
Julian Assange and his colleagues in Wikileaks have shown on numerous occasions that they are one of the last outlets of true democracy and their work for our freedom and speech. Their work for true peace by making public our governments’ actions at home and abroad has enlightened us to their atrocities carried out in the name of so-called democracy around the world. This included footage of inhumanity carried out by NATO/Military, the release of email correspondence revealing the plotting of regime change in Eastern Middle countries, and the parts our elected officials paid in deceiving the public. This is a huge step in our work for disarmament and nonviolence worldwide.
After criticism for awarding the prize to dubious types such as Barack Obama, the Norwegian Nobel Committee is being pressured from Nobel Peace Prize Watch to adhere to Alfred Nobel’s testament and his anti-militarism. Such an award may be the Nobel committee’s greatest opening to celebrate Alfred Nobel’s legacy and garner new luster for the Nobel Peace Prize’s tarnished reputation.
A Nobel Peace Prize should confer some kind of protection and immunity from further political persecution should Assange leave or be forced to vacate the Ecuadorian embassy — should it not? What kind of embassy would kick out a Nobel Peace Prize winner? And would Britain arrest a current Nobel Peace Prize winner? And would the Trump administration seek to persecute a Nobel Peace Prize winner given that Trump has been pining for his own Nobel, risible as that sounds.
Despite Assange’s sacrifice to humanity, he has ruffled the feathers of the power structure. Again, it is clear that Assange must be protected. The Nobel committee must come through for humanity and for peace.
People power needs to mobilize. If people care deeply about their right to be informed, to be apprised of their government partaking in war crimes, then millions must take to the streets and squares, especially in Norway and Britain.

"Video: Israeli Air Strikes on Syria: Weapons, Effects, Consequences",www.therussophile.org,South Front,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/video-israeli-air-strikes-on-syria-weapons-effects-consequences.html/,"This post was originally published on this site
The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) continue their bombing campaign in Syria. In the framework of this campaign, IDF aircraft strike what the Israeli leadership describes as Iranian infrastructure and weapon shipments to Hezbollah and pro-Iranian armed groups. Nonetheless, positions and equipment of the Syrian Armed Forces often appear to be target of Israeli strikes allegedly aimed solely against Iran. In rare cases, when Israel publicly admits strikes in Syria, it claims that the SAF is being targeted because of its “hostile actions” towards Israeli missiles and aircraft entering Syrian airspace.
The unofficial and illegal pattern of Israeli strikes, the double-faced public attitude of the Israeli leadership as well as the unwillingness of Syrian and Iranian forces to admit any damage and casualties caused by Israeli actions hinder efforts to get a real assessment of the effectiveness of the IDF military campaign. Taking into account that the IDF provided little details even into officially declared strikes, this breeds grounds for wild media speculations and rumors.
On the one hand, Syrian and Iranian media demonstrate a classic example of “there were no casualties” coverage. On the other hand, US and Israeli media, and sometimes even official Tel Aviv, time and time again destroy almost entire Iranian military infrastructure and even Syrian air defense system, which then mysteriously resurface by a next Israeli strike.
Despite this, the jets and weapons list employed by the IDF against targets in Syria are an open secret.
The core of the Israeli Air Force striking force is the F-16I Sufa. This warplane is a modified variant of the F-16D block 50 and 52 fighter and ground attack aircraft. The F-16I, which has a crew of two, differs from the original F-16 by modified avionics and weapons systems.
The F-16I is fitted with a pair of removable conformal fuel tanks provided holding 450gal of extra fuel on both sides of the upper fuselage. They increase the aircraft’s mission range and combat endurance. The fitting of conformal tanks makes the two wing inner store stations normally used for external tanks available for weapon carriage expanding the warplane’s air-to-ground weapons capacity. The F16I is fitted with a dorsal avionics compartment, which extends from the rear of the cockpit to the fin and houses additional avionics systems, chaff and flare dispensers and the aircraft’s in-flight refuelling receptacle. Among other equipment, the F-16I got the Elbit Dash IV display and sight helmet system, mission and presentation computers, and digital map display. The jet navigation system includes a combined ring laser gyro inertial navigation system, global positioning system (RLGINS/GPS) and a digital terrain system. The F-16I has the Northrop Grumman AN/APG-68(V)9 multi-mode radar, which reportedly has 5 times the processing speed and 10 times the memory capacity of the previous APG-68 radars on the F-16.
There were 102 F-16I Sufra in service with the Israeli Air Force until February 2018, when the Syrian military shot down one of these jets. It was the first occasion on which Israel lost a jet to an enemy combatant, since 1982.
At the same time, there still has not been a comprehensive evidence to confirm that any of F-35I of the Israeli Air Force (IAF) has been employed in combat ever. Claims by Israeli officials that some F-35I was employed somewhere and somewhen cannot be considered as a reliable proof.
The prime striking weapon used by the IAF is the GBU-39 Small Diameter Bomb (SDB). Vestiges of these bombs are often being found on sites of the Israeli strikes. In particular, GBU-39 SDBs were employed on March 28 when the IAF targeted supposed Iranian targets in Aleppo city.
The GBU-39 SDB is precision-guided glide bomb developed to provide aircraft with the ability to carry a higher number of more accurate bombs. The GBU-39, which was first introduced by Boeing in 2006, has a standoff range of more than 110km due to its pop-out wings. The 250lb (113.6kg) bomb uses an inertial navigation system (INS) and GPS to hit static targets with high accuracy, although it has only 22.7kg of explosives.
Another GBU-39 advantage is its stealthy signature. The bomb has a length of 1.8m and a diameter of 0.19m, but its radar cross section of 0.015m2 only. This creates additional difficulties for enemy air defense systems in the event of a massive strike with the usage of GBU-39 bombs. In September 2008, Israel receives approval from the US Congress to purchase 1,000 bombs. Israel was the first country outside of the US to receive the weapon.
In the event of massive strikes on Syrian air defense systems and alleged Iranian targets, like ones in May and February 2018, and January 2019, the IDF employs a wider list of weapons. For example, the widely-covered destructions of Russia-supplied Pantsir systems of the Syrian military, airstrikes were supported by a massive usage of ground-launched IAI Harop loitering munitions.The IAI Harop is an anti-radiation drone that can autonomously home in on radio emissions. The munition can either operate fully autonomously, using its anti-radar homing system, or it can take a human-in-the-loop mode. If a target is not engaged, the drone will return and land itself back at base.
Thanks to a small radar cross-section, the IAI Harop is intended to target enemy air-defense systems in a first line of attack and can evade SAMs and radar detection systems, which are designed to target much larger aircraft or to intercept fixed-trajectory missiles. It has a flying time of 6 hours and a full range of 1000 km. The IAI Harop has a weight of 135kg, a length of 2.5m and a wingspan of 3m. Unlike other drones that carry explosive warheads, the Harop itself is the main munition with an onboard explosive of 23kg.
Taking into account a wide economic and military support from the US and its coalition, the Israeli military enjoys a relative freedom of operations and has almost an endless stock of offensive means to engage Syria and its Iranian allies in this kind of individual air attacks, which it is currently being employed. A military technical advantage over the Syrian Armed Forces allows Tel Aviv to employ its strike policy almost without suffering real consequence. However, incidents like one in February 2018 demonstrates that this advantage is not something fully irresistible. Over the past few years, Damascus has achieved a visible progress in training and strengthening of its air defense forces, first of all thanks to Russian support. A relatively low efficiently of Israeli strikes on Syria, especially in comparison with the picture provided by pro-Israeli sources, is a demonstration of this. At the same time, modern Syria has no means and resources to repel a wide-scale Israeli aerial operation, if Tel Aviv make a fundamental decision to fully suppress Syrian air defense forces. The issue is that military and diplomatic cost of this “success” that Israel will have to pay for this may appear to be too big. Therefore, the current status quo will remain unchanged in the near future and the IDF will continue to make separate strikes on alleged Iranian targets, which will face limited responses by the Syrian Air Defense.
This puts Russia, which is a key Syrian ally in the sphere of the military technical cooperation, in a complicated situation. So far, Moscow has limited its response to Israeli actions to diplomatic steps, a widely promoted S-300 delivery and a declared modernization of the Syrian air defense network. This “limited” response was predetermined by a role of “neutral force” ready to work with all sides to de-escalate the conflict, which Russia seeks to play in the region. This attitude has weak sides. Currently, most of Syrians see the Russians as heroes and allies that had helped to reverse the course of the war. Nonetheless, the Russian inaction in response to Israeli actions, especially amid the low intensity of military actions on key frontlines, undermines this image. If the situation develops in this direction, in 2-3 years, Russia may lost the hard-won support from the Syrians. In this event, and especially in the event of a lack of success in other fields, Moscow may find itself operating in a very different environment on the ground.

Map of Kosovo
Twenty-five years ago, on 24 March 1999, Operation Allied Force began – the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia that led to the country’s dismemberment – and the independent state of Kosovo was proclaimed. Yet these events were far from historically contingent, as some people claim. So who orchestrated the breakup of Yugoslavia and how?
These days, few remember that the Bulgarians were at the start of it all. Even the Bulgarians themselves don’t like to think about it.
In early March 1999, Bulgaria’s National Intelligence Service told Germany’s Federal Intelligence Service (BND) that it had information about a secret plan by the Yugoslav General Staff, codenamed Operation Horseshoe , to destroy/expel the entire Albanian population of Kosovo and Metohija by 1 April. The BND passed the information on to the German Federal Minister of Foreign Affairs, Joschka Fischer , who took it extremely seriously and immediately called for a military intervention in Yugoslavia , something that went against the pacifist position of the Green party from which he had been appointed foreign minister.
In reality, however, what the Bulgarians had was a map of Kosovo and Metohija that showed the positions of the 52nd Pristina Corps of the Third Army of the Yugoslav Military and police units. Visually, the position of these forces did actually resemble a horseshoe. No one stopped to think that the name of the document contained the word “ potkova “, however, which is specific to the Bulgarian and Croatian languages and would be “potkovica” in Serbian. Since the main advocate for aggression against Yugoslavia was Germany, the Germans cited this plan as the primary reason for a bombing campaign, and the name of the “document” thereafter used the German word Hufeisenplan .
It was only some ten years later that MEP Nadezhda Neynsky (Mihaylova), Bulgaria’s foreign minister in 1999, clarified that the Bulgarian intelligence services had warned the Germans that the information in the “plan” had not been fully confirmed.
But NATO had been present in Kosovo long before the spring of 1999. A NATO-facilitated ceasefire in the region had been signed on 15 October 1998, under which Yugoslav troops returned to their places of permanent deployment. Monitoring of the ceasefire was entrusted to NATO. As part of Operation Eagle Eye, NATO diplomats and military experts were present in Kosovo to observe the situation. Thus, NATO was well aware of all the Yugoslav army’s positions in Kosovo and Metohija and did not need the Bulgarian intelligence services’ “confirmed information”.
Towards the end of 1998, the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), a Kosovo Albanian terrorist group, was on the verge of defeat, but the Albanians felt protected by NATO and continued fighting. The ceasefire collapsed and Albanian militants attacked police patrols and Serbian villages. By the beginning of 1999, the KLA had increased its terrorist activities and the situation in the region had become extremely difficult. The Yugoslav army was forced to resume its anti-terrorist operations knowing full well that NATO was not going to be happy.
In January 1999, a battle took place for the village of Račak, which the KLA had turned into a stronghold with trenches, underground bunkers and machine-gun nests. The exact number of Albanians killed in Račak is still not clear. The KLA and its supporters in Washington maintain that there were casualties among the local population. Yet a forensic examination showed that all of those killed had gunpowder traces on their hands, and the state of the civilian clothes they were wearing was not consistent with the wounds and injuries received.
After talking with KLA field commanders, however, American diplomat William Walker and his military advisor, British General John Drewienkiewicz, insisted that Serbian soldiers had massacred women and children in Račak . Even the Hague Tribunal was subsequently forced to exclude the “incident in Račak” from the list of charges against Slobodan Milošević due to a lack of evidence. In 1999, however, Walker and Drewienkiewicz were adamant .
Veteran US diplomat William Walker, whose declaration of a massacre in Racak paved the way for the 1999 NATO bombing campaign in Kosovo, visits the village today on the 19th anniversary of the massacre. In Kosovo, he is revered as a hero.
In the end, William Walker played a key role in shaping public opinion in English-speaking countries. He maintained to the last that he had seen the headless corpses of women, children and “older men, with gray hair” with his own eyes, even when it had been completely refuted, including by Western experts. In fact, it was William Walker’s vocal position that ultimately made NATO and especially the US favour military action against Yugoslavia, and Bulgaria’s “Potkova” plan showed up at just the right time.
In February 1999, talks were held at the ancient Château de Rambouillet on the outskirts of Paris between the Serbian government and Kosovo Albanians under the auspices of the Contact Group (NATO+Russia). They were a complete failure.
NATO representatives recognised Kosovo as an autonomous province within Serbia, but called for the following: all Yugoslav army units to withdraw from Kosovo; a force of 30,000 NATO troops to be deployed in Kosovo; an unhindered right of passage for NATO troops on Yugoslav territory; and immunity for NATO and its agents to Yugoslav law.
These were controversial conditions for the occupation of Yugoslavia and the complete loss of state sovereignty. Yugoslavia and Russia refused to sign the “agreement”.
On 23 March 1999, Belgrade agreed to recognise the political part of NATO’s proposals (the autonomy of Kosovo), but once again refused categorically to allow NATO troops access to its territory, as well as withdraw its own troops from Kosovo.
On 24 March 1999, NATO Secretary General Javier Solana ordered the commander of NATO troops in Europe, US General Wesley Clark, to begin the assault against Yugoslavia. That evening, the whole of Yugoslavia, including its key cities (Belgrade, Pristina, Podgorica, Novi Sad, Kragujevac, and Pančevo), was subjected to air strikes. Overnight, the American warship USS Gonzalez fired 18 Tomahawk cruise missiles at the city of Niš.
From the very beginning of the NATO aggression against Yugoslavia, there was a clear discrepancy between the stated objectives and the operation being carried out. Initially, NATO had estimated that it would take two to three days to “end the genocide of the Albanian population of Kosovo” by attacking Yugoslav military facilities south of the 44th parallel. Should the country’s leaders continue to resist, then the attacks on targets south of the 44th parallel would be expanded and last up to a week. If Belgrade still refused to make concessions, then the whole country would be targeted, including the capital.
In reality, however, the whole of Yugoslavia, including Belgrade, Novi Sad and Podgorica, was attacked just hours after the operation began. Instead of the original two to three days, the air strikes continued for two and a half months.
The plan categorically ruled out a ground operation. A direct confrontation with the Yugoslav army on the ground was viewed as unacceptable given the predicted losses and the possible escalation of the conflict into a prolonged war due to the nature of the Serbian and Montenegrin mentalities and the resistance of these peoples to external aggression.
Throughout April and May 1999, the air strikes were relentless. Every bridge over the Danube River was demolished, up to 80 per cent of Yugoslavia’s industrial potential was wiped out, and every television and telecommunication tower was purposefully and totally destroyed . At the same time, the first strike on the General Staff building in Belgrade only took place on 30 April (three officers were killed and around 40 injured). The Americans bombed the Chinese Embassy building in Belgrade, believing that it contained radar equipment the Chinese were using to share information with the Serbian Air Defence. Chinese diplomats and embassy staff were killed in the attack.
A Serbian civil train, bombarded by NATO aviation at Grdelica bridge on Apr 12, 1999. At least 15 passengers were burnt alive.
On 12 April, an American F-15 fighter jet attacked a railway bridge over the South Morava river in the Grdelica gorge, destroying a Belgrade-Athens passenger train. Dozens of people were killed, some of whom were reduced to unidentifiable body fragments. General Wesley Clark and NATO Secretary General Javier Solana tried to defend the pilot . The British attacked the city of Niš with cluster bombs – a prohibited weapon designed to destroy enemy personnel. The bombs hit a hospital and a busy market.
On 4 June 1999, Yugoslav President Slobodan Milošević agreed to a peace agreement. On 12 June, NATO forces moved into Kosovo from Macedonia. On 20 June, the 52nd Pristina Corps of the Yugoslav Army left Kosovo.
Several thousand missile and bombing raids were carried out over Yugoslavia during the NATO aggression. Several tens of thousands of bombs and missiles were dropped with a total weight of more than 22,000 tons. Hundreds of industrial plants, oil depots, power plants, and infrastructure including hundreds of road and railway bridges were destroyed or seriously damaged. A large number of historical and architectural sites and monuments were destroyed, along with hundreds of schools, universities, libraries, and more than 20 hospitals. Nearly 40,000 homes were completely destroyed or damaged.
Several thousand people died as a result of the bombing, including hundreds of children. The total material damage was $103 billion.
Why did a “humanitarian intervention” aimed at “preventing the genocide of Kosovo Albanians” result in the complete collapse and breakup of Yugoslavia?

The NATO aggression in 1999 was actually the final stage of the West’s solution to a crucial geopolitical task – the destruction of Yugoslavia. Following the fall of the Soviet bloc, it was not a viable option for Washington and its allies to have a country in Europe capable of pursuing independent policies and defending its own interests.
The cruel, cold-blooded and truly inhuman nature of the operation was meant to show everyone what awaits should they be brave enough to stand in the way of “Western democracy”. The political and military leaders of Yugoslavia and then of Serbia were among the first to experience hybrid warfare techniques and what is now commonly referred to as “fake news”.

President Trump is once again disputing reporting in the Jeff Bezos-owned Washington Post, claiming that its story about his decision to give Mexico one year to stop the flow of drugs and crimes into the US “purposely got it wrong.”
In its story about Trump’s decision to back away from a threat to immediately close the southern border, WaPo reported that Trump had praised the Mexican government for stepping up its efforts to curb illegal migration, despite the fact Mexican authorities “have not altered their enforcement policies.”
Later in the afternoon, ahead of a trade meeting with Chinese officials, Trump praised Mexico for “doing a very good job in the last three or four days since we talked about closing the border,” even though Mexican authorities have said they have not altered their enforcement policies.
Trump disputed this, instead claiming that “Mexico, for the first time in decades, is meaningfully apprehending illegals at THEIR Southern Border, before the long march up to the U.S. This is great and the way it should be.” And if Mexico backslides, Trump said he wouldn’t hesitate to slap a 25% tariff on its auto imports as punishment. The Crazed and Dishonest Washington Post again purposely got it wrong. Mexico, for the first time in decades, is meaningfully apprehending illegals at THEIR Southern Border, before the long march up to the U.S. This is great and the way it should be. The big flow will stop…….
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 5, 2019 ….However, if for any reason Mexico stops apprehending and bringing the illegals back to where they came from, the U.S. will be forced to Tariff at 25% all cars made in Mexico and shipped over the Border to us. If that doesn’t work, which it will, I will close the Border…….
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 5, 2019
These tariffs would supersede USMCA, the sweeping “Nafta 2.0” trade deal between the US, Mexico and Canada that has yet to be ratified by Congress. Similarly, Trump said he’s looking into imposing a “penalty” for the $500 billion in illegal drugs smuggled into the US every year from Mexico. ….This will supersede USMCA. Likewise I am looking at an economic penalty for the 500 Billion Dollars in illegal DRUGS that are shipped and smuggled through Mexico and across our Southern Border. Over 100,00 Americans die each year, sooo many families destroyed!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 5, 2019
Trump concluded the string of tweets by announcing that he was about to leave for the southern border to show off a section of the wall that is under construction. Heading to the Southern Border to show a section of the new Wall being built! Leaving now!

"Dear Mr. President, A Warning…",www.therussophile.org,Tyler Durden,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/dear-mr-president-a-warning.html/,"Authored by Raul Ilargi Meijer via The Automatic Earth blog,
Mr. President,
I write to you because I’m seeing something unfold that concerns you, and I have no way of knowing if you’re aware of it, nor have I seen anyone else mention it. That is, sir, you are being set up, a trap is being set for you, and unless you are aware of it, you may well walk into that trap eyes wide open.
It may not be in your briefing this morning, but the WikiLeaks organization has reported that high-ranking Ecuadorean state officials have told them Julian Assange will be expelled from their London embassy in a matter of “hours to days”. Now, I don’t know what your personal opinion is of Mr. Assange, maybe you think he deserves punishment for leaking secret files to the public.
Your personal opinion of Mr. Assange, however, is not the most important issue here, no offense. What’s most important to your own situation, as well as that of Mr. Assange, is that the people who are after him are the very same people who have been after you for 3 years, and who will double their efforts after suffering a huge loss due to Robert Mueller’s No Collusion report.
What the trap set for you consists of is that if you let these -largely anonymous- deep state actors get their hands on Mr. Assange, you will greatly empower them (even further). But, sir, his enemies inside US intelligence are the same as yours, and empowering one’s enemies is not the way to do battle.
We know they are the same people because of Robert Mueller. Mr. Assange was the only way Mr. Mueller could think of to link you to “the Russians”. This is a narrative built upon the -false- notion that “Russians” hacked the DNC servers and sent the contents to Mr. Assange. The narrative has been fully discredited by multiple voices multiple times, but Mr. Mueller has never retracted it.
For good reason: this way he -and others- can leave the story, and suspicion, open that there is a link between you, Mr. Assange and the Russians, despite the Mueller report’s no collusion conclusion. And do note: it not only maintains the popular and media suspicion of Mr. Assange, it also leaves suspicion of you alive.
Former British ambassador Craig Murray explained the intricacies -again- a few days ago : Muellergate and the Discreet Lies of the Bourgeoisie
Robert Mueller repeats the assertion from the US security services that it was Russian hackers who obtained the DNC emails and passed them on to Wikileaks. I am telling you from my personal knowledge that this is not true . Neither Mueller’s team, not the FBI, nor the NSA, nor any US Intelligence agency, has ever carried out any forensic analysis on the DNC’s servers. The DNC consistently refused to make them available. The allegation against Russia is based purely on information from the DNC’s own consultants, Crowdstrike.
William Binney, former Technical Director of the NSA (America’s US$40 billion a year communications intercept organisation), has proven beyond argument that it is a technical impossibility for the DNC emails to have been transmitted by an external hack – they were rather downloaded locally, probably on to a memory stick. Binney’s analysis is fully endorsed by former NSA systems expert Ed Loomis. There simply are no two people on the planet more technically qualified to make this judgement. Yet, astonishingly, Mueller refused to call Binney or Loomis (or me) to testify. Compare this, for example, with his calling to testify my friend Randy Credico, who had no involvement whatsoever in the matter, but Mueller’s team hoped to finger as a Trump/Assange link.
The DNC servers have never been examined by intelligence agencies, law enforcement or by Mueller’s team. Binney and Loomis have written that it is impossible this was an external hack. Wikileaks have consistently stressed no state actor was involved. No evidence whatsoever has been produced of the transfer of the material from the “Russians” to Wikileaks. Wikileaks Vault 7 release of CIA documents shows that the planting of false Russian hacking “fingerprints” is an established CIA practice. Yet none of this is reflected at all by Mueller nor by the mainstream media. “Collusion” may be dead, but the “Russiagate” false narrative limps on.
Mr. Trump, sir, I don’t doubt you have realized by now that you are not rid yet of Robert Mueller. But Mr. Mueller is but one cog in the large wheel of intelligence running against you. Yes, the same wheel that runs against Mr. Assange. I’m sure you recognize that it’s hugely ironic, but there is a for now unbreakable bond between the two of you.
Not because of anything you did yourselves, but because Russiagate conspirators in the media, the Democratic party and the intelligence community have created it. And you need to be careful on account of that bond, because they’re going to -try to- use it against you.
I may be a lot more sympathetic to Mr. Assange than you are, but as I said before, this has nothing to do with personal opinion. This is about a trap being set for you. And Mr. Assange is an important part of that trap.
Through him, and especially if they keep him incommunicado, they can keep Russiagate alive, which allows for hundreds of billions of dollars in annual arms expenditures and the 24/7/365 threat of war.
Without the empty allegations against Mr. Assange, Robert Mueller would have had to drop his probe much earlier, but in keeping the allegations alive by silencing Mr. Assange, Russiagate can live on, because the link between Russian hackers and WikiLeaks can be left hanging in the air. And that, Mr. President, will be bad news for you, whether you like it or not, whether you acknowledge it or not.
We haven’t talked about the media yet, but there’s another giant irony in the US media clamoring about press freedom, and using it to smear you for 3 years, but not saying a single word to defend that same freedom when it comes to Mr. Assange. They, too, will continue to haunt you, using Mr. Assange as their bait. Don’t let them.
I don’t know what you intend to do about Russiagate and its main perpetrators, but I do know you can make things much easier for yourself if you solve the Assange conundrum first. And you can’t do that by allowing your own enemies to get their hands on him and rendition him; that will backfire on you.
You could pardon him, but that may be a step too far for you at this point. It might be better to simply allow him to go home to Australia.
What would amuse me to no end is if you would personally nominate him for a Nobel Peace Prize. That would piss off so many of your enemies it would be a sight to see. The biggest bird you can flip them all. And then after that, you know, go talk to Vladimir Putin and tell him you’re sorry for all this bad theater.
There’s this scene in the Godfather where Marlon Brando as the ageing Don tells Al Pacino how to recognize the traitor in his own midst: the one who suggests setting up a meeting. This is very similar: whoever comes to you to suggest the harshest treatment of Julian Assange, will be the one(s) intent on coming after you too.
One last thing, Mr. President : Julian Assange, Chelsea Manning and Edward Snowden are among the best, brightest and bravest people our world has to offer. We need people like them, and we need them badly. And it’s a lot more stupid than it is simply ironic, that they are the ones we are locking up and silencing. That way America will never be great again, guaranteed.
And you, sir (I know, more irony) may be their -and our- best and even last hope. You have the power to set free our best. Please use it wisely. And Mr. President, sir, be careful out there.
Know your enemies."
Putin believes incumbent president’s performance is ‘best election campaign’,www.therussophile.org,Michael Sullivan,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/putin-believes-incumbent-presidents-performance-is-best-election-campaign.html/,"This post was originally published on this site
MOSCOW, April 5. /TASS/. Russian President Vladimir Putin believes that for an incumbent head of state in a certain country the best election campaign is his performance, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters when asked whether the Kremlin believed an election campaign should resemble a show.
“President Putin has always believed that for an incumbent head of state his performance is the best election campaign,” Peskov emphasized. He noted that it was not the Kremlin’s purview to comment on election campaigns, adding that it would be more appropriate to pose this question to voters.
Peskov recalled that, during Putin’s election campaigns, the Russian president “was always very scrupulous about his program, his plans and painstaking in terms of conveying these plans to voters, to the public.”
“You know that he does that exhaustively, either addressing people directly or communicating with representatives of various professions, social groups and so on, using the media. That is, the most important thing for Putin is specific results of specific endeavors, realistic plans a candidate comes up with for his election campaign. That has always been Putin’s political credo, and you know that this credo is highly sought after in our country and enjoys the population’s overwhelming support,” Peskov stressed.

"Riga mayor blasts Latvian minister’s ‘illegal decision’, vows to 'overcome all obstacles'",www.therussophile.org,Michael Sullivan,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/riga-mayor-blasts-latvian-ministers-illegal-decision-vows-to-overcome-all-obstacles.html/,"This post was originally published on this site
RIGA, April 5. /TASS/. Nils Usakovs, the sacked Chairman of the Riga City Council, is confident that he can handle the political pressure imposed on him, he said on Friday.
“Now I will have to walk along the road of pressure and humiliation, but don’t doubt my character. I will overcome all these obstacles and under any circumstances I will always be with my voters,” he wrote on his Facebook page.
Usakovs thanked all of Riga’s residents for 10 years of cooperation for the sake of the Latvian capital and slammed Minister for Environmental Protection and Regional Development Juris Puce for his decision to dismiss the Riga Mayor.
“At the 2017 Riga City Council elections, current Minister Puce got only 5,000 votes, while I received 105,000 votes. For a decade, not once, have they been able to defeat me in a fair, open and democratic process, but now, the times have changed,” the politician elaborated. Illegal decision
“The minister made an unlawful decision to dismiss me from office,” Usakovs added. “His list of violations is an attempt to dig up the smallest procedural infraction, which includes a reprimand over sending the response [of Usakovs about possible legal violations in the Riga City Council] via mail and not via e-mail. This is, of course, going to be appealed in court. It’s the citizens of Riga that made me their mayor and only they can dismiss me and not Puce and other political midgets!”
Usakovs also blasted Minister Juris Puce for political insincerity.
“According to the Minister, his decision to dismiss me corresponds with “the growth of political and law culture,” Nils Usakovs pointed out. “The politician who created his party from the money he had raked in from the slot machine business is talking about political culture? How can a minister in a government that has just duped all of its voters be talking about political culture?”
On Friday, Latvia’s official publisher Latvijas Vestnesis published a decree signed by Minister for Environmental Protection and Regional Development Juris Puce ordering the dismissal of Riga Mayor Nils Usakovs. The decree listed all the violations that Usakovs committed as mayor, which mainly relate to the cooperation between the city and the Rigas Satiksme transportation company and claims that there were inconsistencies in a report on the authorized capital of the Riga transportation enterprise and budget injections into it.
As the decree stipulates, Nils Usakovs as the Riga Mayor and a Rigas Satiksme shareholder is fully responsible for all the discrepancies in the reports, it also states that the decision can be appealed within 30 days of its publication. Riga’s Satiksme public transportation scandal
On January 30, the Latvian Corruption Prevention and Combating Bureau searched the Riga mayor’s office and residence as part of a criminal investigation of the Rigas Satiksme transportation company that has been mired in a corruption scandal since the end of 2018. Usakovs said that he had not committed any crime or any criminal offences whatsoever. According to him, no investigation was launched against him and no suspicions were put forward. Latvian nationalists demanded that he resign, however, the politician retained his position in office.
Following these events, Puce said that his ministry had begun investigating the Riga City Council. On March 21, the ministry reported that the probe had been completed and a number of possible violations had been identified, while the mayor had to provide explanations about these findings. In accordance with Latvian law, the Regional Development Minister can sack the mayor or initiate the dissolution of the Riga City Council. Earlier, Usakovs repeatedly vowed that if an illegal decision on his discharge was taken, he would appeal in court.
In February, Nils Usakovs said that he would be running for the European Parliament because the Saeima (Latvian Parliament), according to the politician, de facto “had declared war” on Riga’s citizens. He added that this decision was not related to the corruption scandal over the city’s transport deals.

MOSCOW, April 5. /TASS/. Member-countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) have agreed to coordinate their actions to protect the UN Charter’s norms and principles, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on Friday following a meeting of the CIS Council of Foreign Ministers.
“We exchanged views on the key international issues in light of those challenges and threats, which, unfortunately, have been piling up on the global stage,” the minister pointed out. “We looked at how international law is being significantly eroded, how meddling in sovereign countries’ domestic affairs is practiced depending on political expediency, with the methods of ultimatums and the policy of dictating one’s terms being used increasingly more often.”
“Our common opinion was the need to coordinate more closely our actions as CIS members and [the CIS member-states’ actions] with other countries in terms of protecting the norms and principles of the UN Charter,” Lavrov said. “We discussed in detail issues related to multilateral cooperation within the CIS, including in foreign policy. In order to strengthen the coordination of our actions, we amended the plan of inter-ministerial consultations within the Commonwealth for 2019 and, at the same time, took note of the successful compliance with a similar plan for 2018.”
According to Russia’s top diplomat, the CIS member-states assign high priority to the initiative put forward by Turkmenistan’s President Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedov regarding the intensification of partnership between the CIS diplomatic services. “This program is in a high degree of readiness. We hope to complete work on that very important document soon,” he added.
Lavrov noted that the ministers spoke a lot about human rights issues and ways of promoting the principles enshrined in the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights. “We agreed to push ahead with efforts to coordinate our actions in the human rights sphere,” he said. According to the Russian foreign minister, the parties also discussed the current state and prospects for Eurasian integration and the CIS’s role in that process.

KRASNOYARSK, April 5. /TASS/. The Arctic tourism-recreational cluster with investments above 4 billion rubles ($61 million) will be organized in the Krasnoyarsk Region. It will unite Norilsk, Dudinka and Taimyr’s Putorana Plateau, the Agency for Norilsk’s Development’s Deputy Director Maxim Mironov told TASS on Friday.
“We have begun the project, currently we are working on its concept jointly with the regional tourism authority, administrations of Norilsk and Taimyr,” he said. “The cluster’s investment projects are estimated at 4 billion rubles, where one billion will be attracted under the National Project.”
The share of private investments will grow, the official added.
Investments will be in infrastructures: river berths, roads, and business hotels, he continued. “We shall build renewable energy sources on the Putorana Plateau.”
Norilsk will become a center of cultural, educational and industrial tourism, Dudinka – of ethnography tourism, and the Putorana Plateau – of extreme and ecology tourism.
Earlier, the Krasnoyarsk Region’s head of the Tourism Agency Yulia Verkhushina told TASS the region was working on a complex plan to develop tourism in the region’s north, with estimated investments of 4 billion rubles.
The Agency for Norilsk’s Development was established by the city administration, the Nornickel Company and the Vladimir Potanin Foundation in 2017 to offer favorable conditions for sustainable social and economic development, better living conditions, to make a positive social environment and to develop the human capital.

Nation Awaits Apology From Media That Pushed Fake News Story for Two Years,www.therussophile.org,Phil Russ,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/nation-awaits-apology-from-media-that-pushed-fake-news-story-for-two-years.html/,"This post was originally published on this site
U.S.—According to sources from all across the country, the nation is still waiting for an apology for the media that pushed a fake news story connecting Donald Trump to Russia for two full years.
While those who supported Donald Trump were understandably a touch upset that they’ve been called Russian bots and Putin’s puppets for years now, they reported they were certain that an apology would be coming shortly from the press that pushed the story every time they got a chance, regardless of the evidence.
“Any second now,” one Trump supporter in Texas told reporters. “I’m absolutely confident that the press will own up to their errors and vow to learn from these mistakes. I mean, it’s not like they’ll just brush this all under the rug, move the goalposts, or somehow spin this into being our fault.”
“That would be, like, totally fake news, and I trust that the American press is above that,” he added.
Conservatives across the country were refreshing their newsfeeds and flipping through major media channels, awaiting the heartfelt apology from political pundits who dedicated their shows and commentary to the now-debunked Russiagate scandal 24/7.
Sources also confirmed that the nation is still waiting for an apology for the media’s complicity in the Iraq War, the smearing of the Covington Catholic students, and the wild conspiracy theories about Brett Kavanaugh."

I have certain rules I live by. My first rule: I don’t believe anything the government tells me. Nothing. Zero.
– George Carlin
Let me tell you, you take on the intelligence community and they have six ways from Sunday at getting back at you.
– Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer in a 2017 interview on MSNBC
As someone whose website was slandered by the earliest manifestations of the hysterical Russiagate mob, I could go on and on now that’s the whole spectacle’s been disproven, but I’m not going to do that. Rather, I want to highlight how despite the whole thing blowing up, we’ll be living with severe direct consequences for years to come.
First, it’s important to point out that none of Russiagate’s most irresponsible grifters will face any serious repercussions for wasting the country’s time, money and energy on a fake story for the past two years. Russiagate was as much a business model as it was a conspiracy theory, and some of it’s most shameless peddlers made out like bandits over the past couple of years.
As Glenn Greenwald noted:
Let’s not forget Luke Harding, a guy who literally wrote a book titled “Collusion,” which naturally soared to the top of the New York Times bestseller list.
Of course, nothing seriously damaging will happen to Rachel, Luke or the other myriad Russiagate charlatans who drove and profited handsomely from what was by far the biggest conspiracy theory of the past two years. Will they be banned from Facebook, Twitter or YouTube? Of course not, despite the fact that they played a larger role than anybody else with respect to driving our national conversation into a cesspool of insanity, xenophobia and falsehoods.
Nevertheless, you can be sure Tim Cook, Sundar Pichai and Mark Zuckerberg will never come out and condemn them for peddling endless amounts fake news. No tech giant scarlet letter will be forthcoming for the priests and priestesses of Russiagate; but why not?
The simple answer is that all the public concern about “fake news” was just a ruse — the tech giants were just pretending to care about it. The real objective was to appease angry politicians by finding an excuse to erase and de-rank opinions that don’t conform to the dispositions and leanings that dominate the executive suites of the largest tech companies and the power players in establishment Washington D.C.
Incredibly enough, the entire push that convinced much of the public of a pressing need to encourage tech giants to aggressively censor and ban certain opinions was driven by Russiagate in the first place. In other words, hysteria and fear that Russian propaganda would infect the minds of the American public was a primary driver in getting much of our culture to accept flippant de-platforming from tech giants across the platforms that have come to dominate online conversation in this country. Russiagate is now over, but tech giant censorship remains. We’ve been scammed in far more serious and long-lasting ways than meets the eye.
Now would be a good time to revisit a few excerpts from last year’s piece, These Are the Times Bitcoin Was Made For :
Donald Trump’s election and Bernie Sanders’ unexpectedly strong run in a rigged Democratic primary really shook the neoliberal/neocon establishment to its core. The status quo response has been as pathetic as it’s been extraordinary, with the hysteria so completely off the wall I sometimes wonder if the whole Russia-Trump collusion narrative was invented and propagated for the sole purpose of promoting a cultural acceptance of censorship.
There are two crucial attack vectors being targeted when it comes to punishing the transgressions of American thought criminals; money and communications, and we need to understand that Alex Jones is our cultural guinea pig. The tech giants started by kneecapping his voice by simultaneously de-platforming his presence from many of today’s dominant communications platforms. Now PayPal’s moved in to make payments more difficult, thus threatening his ability to earn money. You don’t have to like anything Alex Jones does to see how dangerous this is. What’s being done to him can and will be to done to others deemed undesirable by Silicon Valley oligarchs should they get popular enough. What’s emerging is a playbook on how to exert pressure and encourage self-censorship in the digital age and you better pay attention.
Let’s take another step back to take stock of where we’re at. Sure a bunch of scam-artist pundits and fake journalists were momentarily embarrassed, but these people have no shame and many of them already achieved fame and fortune. Moreover, just like the banker crooks of the financial crisis era and the Iraq war WMD peddlers that came before them, these people are more likely to be promoted than face any life-altering consequences for the society damaging lies they spread. In fact, our system is so completely rigged in favor of certain kinds of opinions, not even the most bald faced liars amongst them will even see their social media accounts shuttered.
So yes, Russiagate has blown up spectacularly, but we’re still left with selective tech giant censorship which focuses on a certain type of “conspiracy theory” or fake news. What Facebook, Apple, Google and others have made clear at this point is that fake news is fine as long as it’s repeating lies of the government or intelligence agencies. There’s no amount of war-creating government inspired fake news someone can spread that will ever get you banned by the tech giants, but if you dare to have a discussion about vaccines, 9/11 or flat-earth , you’ll never be heard from again.
Russiagate ending doesn’t alter this entrenched and very dangerous double standard. We’re once again left with a monumental falsehood exposed, yet the damage has already been done to public discourse and the ability to freely communicate on America’s dominant tech platforms. As such, we’ll continue to be led apathetically in a very restrictive and unfree direction unless we wake up and make some serious changes.
Yes, a ridiculous, false and deranged conspiracy theory has been disproven, but the damage has already been done — and the damage is severe."

This screen grab from video footage by Ruptly shows the Russian Black Sea Fleet conducting missile drills.
Russia’s Black Sea Fleet held missile firing exercises in the Black Sea, as shown in footage released on Friday.
The Tarantul-III-class corvette Ivanovets and her sister ship, the R-60, took part in the drills, which involved hitting targets 30 nautical miles away with the P-270 Moskit supersonic anti-ship missile.
The Moskit is a supersonic missile designed to destroy enemy warships weighing up to 20,000 tons at a range of up to 90 kilometers away. The weapon flies close to the surface of the water to avoid radar detection, using high speeds and rapid maneuvres to avoid the target’s anti-missile defenses.

Syria’s Information Minister Imad Sarah said that his country does not have any information about the remains of US-born Israel soldier, Zachary Baumel, nor about the operation that led to the recovery of the remains.
“The Syrian state has no clue about the remains of any Israeli soldier anywhere in Syria, if any, it would have acted according to its national interests, and that what it used to do,” Sarah told the Syrian state TV over the phone on April 4.
The Syrian minister went on to say that some armed groups might have cooperated with Israel on this case and helped it recover the body of the soldier without the Syrian state approval.
Baumel and two other Israeli soldiers, Yehuda Katz and Tzvi Feldman, went missing during the battle of Sultan Yacoub on June 10 of 1982. The Syrian Arab Army (SAA) killed 20 Israeli soldiers during the battle and captured several Israeli tanks, one of them is believed to be Bumel’s tank.
The Israeli military announced on April 3 that the remains of Baumel were recovered from Syria in in a complex and secret operation known as “Operation Bittersweet Song.” Russia’s President Vladimir Putin confirmed that Russian and Syria forces played a role in the operation , contrary to Sarah’s claim.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited Moscow on April 4 to thank Putin personally. The Israeli PM also attended a ceremony that was held in the headquarters of the Ministry of Defense of Russia on the honor of Baumel, before returning with the remains to Israel.

US Army Seeks Future Attack Helicopter To Replace Apache Fleet,www.therussophile.org,uchfkaf32,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/us-army-seeks-future-attack-helicopter-to-replace-apache-fleet.html/,"This post was originally published on this site

The U.S. Army is considering whether it should purchase Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft (FARA) to replace its aging fleet of Boeing AH-64 Apache and Bell OH-58D Kiowa Warrior copters, reported Task & Purpose .
“The FARA will only replace Apaches in our heavy attack reconnaissance squadrons and this represents about half of the Apache fleet,” a spokesperson for Army Chief of Staff Gen. Mark Milley told Aviation Week.
“There have already been serious questions about whether the AH-64 platform will be able to remain relevant, especially in a high-end conflict environment, through 2048, when the Army plans to retire the very last of the gunships,” Joseph Trevithick at The War Zone explained.
“ The Army expects to be integrating significant upgrades into its latest AH-64E Guardian variants through 2026. These include updates to its fire control and targeting systems, improved data sharing and fusion capabilities, better sensors, a more robust ability to work directly with unmanned aircraft and more,” Trevithick added.
In 2018, the Army selected several FARA candidates. Sikorsky is currently in the running with the S-97 Raider high-speed scout and attack helicopter. Bell is developing a V-280 Valor tiltrotor that was also selected.

“We’re looking for an aircraft that, without going into specific requirements or classifications, essentially goes further, can see further, can acquire specific targets further and can engage at greater ranges than current exist and has greater legs – can fly further with a greater payload of weapon systems, ” Milley told Congress on March 26, 2019.
The Army could purchase hundreds of FARA helicopters within the next ten years. If a new helicopter replaces the AH-64 and OH-58D, then the service could be looking at 700 new aircraft – a contract worth tens of billions of dollars.

ISIS notorious leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, is currently hiding in the Homs desert, which is besieged by the Syrian Arab Army (SAA) and its allies, the Asia Times reported on March 28, citing a Syria source.
According to the source, the terrorist group has been preparing the region, which lays between eastern Homs and western Deir Ezzor, to host Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and his senior commanders since 2015.
“In 2015 they brought a lot of weapons [to the Homs desert], which they’d gotten from Mosul. And they secured the route from al-Baghuz. All the high commanders took weapons and money to this area, because it’s impossible to conquer – you can’t seize it with warplanes and you can’t seize it with an army. There aren’t even roads and there are no inhabitants. Just some Bedouins, but no approaches anywhere near the mountains,” the Hong Kong-based outlet quoted the sources as saying.
More than 1,000 fighters are believed to be hiding in the Homs desert. According to the available information, most of these terrorists are not only heavily armed, but also highly-experienced.
Hisham al-Hashemi, a Baghdad-based terrorism expert, confirmed the Syrian source’s claims saying that the terrorist leader could be indeed hiding in the Homs desert.
“Certainly he is still alive, he did not participate in any battle and was not close to any battlefield … The ISIS security detail that guards Baghdadi knows that keeping the Caliph alive is more important than maintaining the Caliphate,” al-Hashemi said.
The Iraqi experts said that al-Baghdadi, whose real name is Ibrahim Awwad Ibrahim Al-Badri Al-Samarrai, is suffering from several heath issues, including diabetes. A prominent ISIS commander, who was arrested by the Iraqi intelligence last November, made the same claims.
If al-Baghdadi is indeed hiding in the Homs desert, he will likely end up killed or captured by the SAA and its allies. Last year, the SAA killed the terrorist leaders’ son near the desert region.

VeteransToday …by Jonas E. Alexis
Both Beijing and Moscow seem to have sent an unspoken ultimatum to the New World Order in Washington and elsewhere: Venezuela is not going to become another Iraq or Afghanistan or Libya.
We have seen how Russia sent military troops to Venezuela last weekend, and now China is backing Russia. New World Order agents like John Bolton are again mad and sad and want to be bad. Bolton himself declared that the United States “will not tolerate hostile foreign military powers meddling” within the Western Hemisphere. [1]
Well, the statement self-destructs, doesn’t it? How did the United States get involved in Venezuela in the first place? Who gave New World Order agents the license to steal, kill, and destroy in the name of “democracy” and “freedom”?
In any event, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov that Washington ‘will not stand idly by as Russia exacerbates tensions in Venezuela.” [2] Mr. Pompeo, do you really think that Russia should stand idly by as the United States exacerbates tensions virtually all over the world? As we have argued elsewhere, the United States has been involved in diabolical activities for over a century! [3]
NWO agents like Pompeo has not even apologized to the world for the chaos they have created. In fact, they think that the United States should pick up a country every ten years and destroy it. You almost certainly remember Jonah Goldberg’s endorsement of Michael Ledeen’s diabolical ideology. Goldberg unflinchingly declared:
“I’ve long been an admirer of, if not a full-fledged subscriber to, what I call the ‘Ledeen Doctrine’…’Every ten years or so, the United States needs to pick up some small crappy little country and throw it against the wall, just to show the world we mean business.’” [4]
Both Jewish Neocons Goldberg and Ledeen are destroyers, and they want to use the United States for their dirty work in the Middle East and elsewhere. With respect to the Iraq War, Goldberg added: “The United States needs to go to war with Iraq because it needs to go to war with someone in the region and Iraq makes the most sense.” [5]
Goldberg and his brethren do not believe in dialogue obviously because dialogue presupposes a moral and political order. Goldberg prefers aggressive expansion:
“There is nothing we want to see happen in the Middle East that can be accomplished through talking around long tables festooned with bottled water and fresh fruit at Swiss hotels, that cannot be accomplished faster and more permanently through war. But there is plenty that cannot be achieved by such gabfests that can only be achieved through war.” [ 6]
Goldberg again declared long before the debacle in Iraq—and pay close attention here:
“Wouldn’t an invasion of Iraq result in instability in the region? Yes. But in this context, instability is more likely to be good than bad.” [7]
Did you catch that? Instability is more likely to be good than bad. Now the same people are telling us that they are attempting to establish “democracy” and “freedom” in Venezuela. Who are these people really kidding?
In any event, we should give two thumbs up for Russia and China for saying that enough is enough. If both countries are stopping the New World Order from destroying any other country in the world, then we should definitely applaud such an effort.

The US Just Debunked India’s F-16 Conspiracy Theory,www.therussophile.org,Andrew Korybko,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/the-us-just-debunked-indias-f-16-conspiracy-theory.html/,"This post was originally published on this site
The US surprisingly debunked India’s F-16 conspiracy theory a week before the onset of the country’s upcoming month-long general election for reasons that have to do with protecting the Pentagon’s prestige and playing “good cop, bad cop” with New Delhi in order to extract maximum concessions from its new “Lead From Behind” Great Power proxy.
Surprising Timing
The “deep state”-connected US international affairs publication “ Foreign Policy ” reported that unnamed American officials confirmed to them that Washington has accounted for all of the F-16s in Pakistan’s arsenal and thus debunked India’s conspiracy theory that it allegedly shot one of them down back in February.
The timing of this announcement surprised many observers because it came just a week before the onset of India’s month-long general election process and is considered to be a heavy blow to incumbent Prime Minister Modi ahead of his uphill reelection battle.
This might initially seem perplexing because he’s regarded as the most pro-American leader in India’s history after agreeing to the 2016 LEMOA deal that allows US forces to use all Indian military bases on a case-by-case “logistical” basis, but there’s actually a reasonable explanation for why the US “leaked” its findings at the time that it did.
Protecting The Pentagon’s Prestige
The US was left red-faced after its Indian “ Lead From Behind ” Great Power proxy clumsily concocted its now-discredited conspiracy theory in a desperate attempt to “save face” after being humiliated by the global pivot state of Pakistan , which had the temporary effect of muddling the minds of the international audience to New Delhi’s benefit but also cast Washington’s military-industrial complex in an extremely negative light by claiming that a vintage Soviet warplane was able to down an impressive American jet.
Even though India knew that its lie would eventually be exposed after ihunt had the audacity to publicly urge the US to investigate its false claims, it wrongly gambled that Islamabad wouldn’t allow Washington to verify this in a timely manner owing to the visible deterioration of Pakistani-American ties since the beginning of Trump’s presidency, having ignored their relative improvement over the past few months since the revival of the Afghan peace process.
Pakistan, not having anything to hide because it knew that India was lying all along, actively facilitated the US’ request to investigate India’s claims, and America wasted no time in protecting the prestige of its military-industrial complex by punishing its proxy for impugning the Pentagon’s reputation just a week before the start of India’s general election process.
“Cracking The Whip”
This also served the dual purpose of “cracking the whip” by functioning as a “bad cop” ploy to the US’ usual “good cop” one towards India, therefore increasing the chances that America can extract maximum strategic concessions from its new regional proxy, most likely in the military and especially economic spheres.
The US knows that Modi already locked India in an irreversible alliance with it that Congress would be powerless to change even if it came out on top in the upcoming elections because these two countries’ permanent military, intelligence, and diplomatic bureaucracies (“deep states”) are already too closely interconnected to be decoupled, which means that Modi is nowadays expendable to the US and Trump probably wouldn’t mind him losing power as punishment for publicly impugning America’s multibillion-dollar military-industrial complex and possibly costing it some lucrative deals in the process.
From One Conspiracy To Another
Nevertheless, India is already rolling out a crackpot conspiracy theory alleging that all of this is just fake news and that the US is simply covering up for the F-16’s failure, copying a page from the playbook of the Russiagaters who are still desperately continuing to push that respective conspiracy despite Mueller’s report certifiably debunking it.
That effort speaks to the Bollywood mentality presently pervasive in India’s “deep state” which condescendingly presumes that the intended audience of the country’s “strategic communication” campaigns is extremely unintelligent and incapable of even the most basic reasoning skills, as the reactionary “counter-narrative” (if it can even be called that) of screaming “fake news” and refusing to recognize reality as it objectively exists would never be propagated if the originators of this claim respected their audience’s intelligence.
It might actually be the case that this rudimentary infowar effort is very effective with India’s domestic audience, which could partially explain why its “deep state” made the false assumption that the international one would fall for this as well, but the foreign audience at large doesn’t have any reason to take India’s debunked claims at face value anymore and will probably react in a counterproductive way by tuning out its narratives in the future or at least seriously scrutinizing them the next time the country makes similarly serious claims.
Concluding Thoughts
While it initially took many people off guard, it actually makes complete sense that the US would expose India’s F-16 lies ahead of the country’s upcoming election in order to defend the prestige of its military-industrial complex and “crack the whip” by playing “good cop, bad cop” with the now-expendable Modi, though the Bollywood-indoctrinated Indian “deep state” is still so shocked by this development that all it knows how to do is respond by propagating a self-discrediting crackpot conspiracy theory that will likely end up being counterproductive to its long-term infowar interests.

By Jason DevaneyNEWSMAX
Former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos, who served less than two weeks in prison last fall for lying to the FBI as part of the Russia investigation, thinks the lawyers he had at the time were “possibly compromised” and played a role in getting him time behind bars.
“It’s a very complicated story,” he told Law&Crime Network’s Brian Ross . “There’s been such misunderstanding and misrepresentation about who George Papadopoulos is.”
Papadopoulos added he was certain no collusion occurred between the Trump campaign and Russia, and was then asked a follow-up about whether he had regrets about pleading guilty.
“I have new counsel for a reason,” he said. “I believe my old counsel was possibly compromised.”
Papadopoulos was later asked if he would be interested in receiving a pardon from President Donald Trump, but he said that would not be much help to him.
“A pardon doesn’t actually practically impact my life right now,” he said.
“I was set up, and it was made to seem that I was up to no good [and] working with Russians or Russian intermediaries. I’m not spouting conspiracy theories.”
Papadopoulos’ role in the Russia investigation is complex , and he claims members of western intelligence services created a ruse to make it appear as if he was working with the Russians during the 2016 campaign.
“These were not Russian operatives who were engaging with me but Western intelligence operatives,” he told Ross. “Possibly FBI operatives themselves.”

6 Stars – A Seminal Work Integrating Deep Looks from Others – A Mind-Altering Soul-Enhancing Book
Given the author’s past as a former Russian intelligence employee, I have considered the possibility that this book is an active disinformation treatise. While some of this information may be exaggerated or mis-interpreted, on balance I believe this to be a most valuable holistic perspective essential to taking down the Deep State.
My bottom line up front: the Deep State — the vestiges of the Black Nobility/Ceasar, the British Empire, the Vatican, the Zionists, and the Freemasons (33+ only – the rest can be saved) and their banking fronts including the Rothschilds and Central Banks — are the common enemies of America, China, and Russia as well as all other nation-states and cultural/ethnic/linguistic tribes. We are not doing well at collaborating against these common enemies.
This book floored me. Written in 2011 and republished in 2015, this book is one of three in the past ten years that have altered my perception of reality. The other two:
I thought I understood covert action and its subset propaganda. I did not. What this book makes clear, with meticulous naming of names (drawing on varied noted sources), is that virtually everything about our daily lives is propaganda, from church and school to the news to social media to government lies and “statistics.” I am a fan of Jon Rappoport’s work ( The Matrix and his blog No More Fake News ), I managed a false flag operation for the CIA, I have done a great deal to confront fake news, but this book leaves me almost breathless with disbelief. EVERYTHING is a programmed lie – I am reminded of Barbara Honegger’s IN THE ROOM recollection of William Casey telling Ronald Reagan:
“We’ll know our disinformation program is complete when everything the American public believes is false.”
Barbara Honegger, Quora , 25 November 2014
At the above link, do not miss Bill Bray, retired CIA scientist, on the fake news culture that CIA spawns.
The saddest and most troubling aspect of this book for me, as a former CIA operations officer, was its documentation of the degree to which CIA, in active collaboration with universities funded by the Rockefellers and other elites, deliberately created the drug culture in the 1960’s, liberally dispensing LSD and other drugs, and in particularly, handing out 50,000 or so LSD tabs at Woodstock. The author is compelling in suggesting that the Grateful Dead (perhaps unwitting) were a covert operation by the CIA intended to introduce and then proliferate the drug and consciousness culture, reducing by a considerable number those able to reach adulthood without losing a substantial portion of their brain cells.
QUOTE (110): “At Woodstock,” writes journalist Donald Phau, “nearly half a million youth gathered to be drugged and brainwashed on a farm. The victims were isolated, immersed in filth, pumped with [free] psychedelic drugs, and kept awake continuously for three straight days, and all with the full complicity of the FBI and government officials.”
Decades later, and after Viet-Nam, we have the crack cocaine explosion at the intersection of the Nicaraguan contras, the US Marine Corps and El Toro, and the CIA.
Review: Dark Alliance–The CIA, the Contras, and the Crack Cocaine Explosion
The second most troubling aspect of this book for me, as a lapsed Catholic and still Christian who believes strongly in the family unit as the foundation for national power (along with the education of its citizens in the art of critical reasoned thinking) was the documentation of how the pill was explicitly invented and popularized (along with Affirmative Action) in order to break up families and foster a libertine culture harmful to children, at the same time that television and Hollywood were used to dumb down the popular and make all manner of perversions “normal.” Herbert Marcuse and others have defined “repressive tolerance” as the ultimate destroyer of family, community, and tribal values: when “anything goes,” which is the Democratic Party’s approach to life, then NOTHING is sacred.

Although the author relies heavily on one or two sources around which he builds a chapter, he has a gift for synthesis and a gift for narrative, and I have to say that this book is a capstone book – a book so important that if I had the money I would be handing out ten million copies tomorrow.
There is a Trumpian bottom line that I want to emphasize up front: the absolute worst nightmare for the Deep State and the 1% elite seeking to create a New World Order in which the 99% are dumbed down drugged up automatons, is a strong family unit and bottom up community ethos that values individual learning and independence of mind. We are at the tail end of fifty years of elite efforts to destroy our ability to think for ourselves while seeking to infect us with both physical and mental diseases, all the while carrying out eugenics and euthanasia programs ranging from vaccines that sterilize to wars based on 935 lies (Iraq).
Review: 935 Lies – The Future of Truth and the Decline of America’s Moral Integrity
We are in the midst of a moral and spiritual decline that has been deliberately contrived over the past seventy two years, since 1947 to be precise (the National Security Act and more). CIA was created by Wall Street to be its secret fixer and destabilizer not only abroad, but in the USA, establishing covert and controlled positions in every institution of significance including local law enforcement and of course state governments – Governor Jesse Ventura has spoken and written to this point.
There are three targets that the Deep State – the New World Order elitists – desire to destroy: the first is the individual, who cannot be allowed to be effectively armed, educated, and independent; the second is the family, which Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew once called the bedrock of civilization and which others have said is the precise opposite of the industrial slavery model; the second is the nation-state, that cannot be allowed to be effectively armed, educated, and independent.
The author, drawing on thin but balanced sources, excels at making it clear that all the chaos in the world is contrived – the whole point is to keep us all off balance and unable to realize that there is ample wealth for everyone if we simply come together with intelligence and integrity. We are being lied to, divided and conquered, drugged up, “herded,” and generally repressed mentally, spiritually, and physically. 600 lb people are not an accident – they are a symptom of a complete breakdown – BY DESIGN – of the cultural and social mores that characterize healthy people living in healthy communities.
The author excels at documenting – with the help of his few cited sources – the timeline from World War II to today – in which the psychological operations profession saw a marriage of the Nazis, the British, and the CIA, in service to the 1%, toward the end of asserting political control over everyone on the basis of driving everyone into a state of psychosis using programmed behavior modification.
The New World Order (One World Order) fascist corporate state demands the end of nationalism, the repression of languages and cultures and ethnic or cultural identities, the fragmentation of the family, and the dissolution of community. In other words, everything that we in “fly over” country or the rural heartland, believe is our essence. I cannot help but conclude that California and New York are now like the concentration camp or prison “trustees” of the neo-Nazi elitists, and this is one reason why the Electoral College is so important – to keep those two states populated by libertine morons from destroying America the Beautiful.
Early on the author talks about how the elites understand that local sheriffs loyal to their local communities are a major obstacle to the imposition of a “national” police regime, and I contemplate how we have since 9/11 – a false flag operation by the Zionists with the complicity of Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld (and then the post-event obstruction of justice and complicity in murder after the fact of Robert Mueller) – militarized our police and turned the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) into a national Gestapo that specializes in false flag operations from Sandy Hook to the Boston Bombing to Orlando and beyond.
Memoranda for the President on 9/11: Time for the Truth — False Flag Deep State Truth! UPDATE 14: Spanish Translation
The author covers MKULTRA and mind-control to an extent, and between this book and other reading I am now persuaded that virtually every “active shooter” since 9/11 has been a mind-controlled individual explicitly activated to terrorize us and justify even more draconian police measures.
QUOTE (13): Deliberate and habitual falsification of the information is a way of creating desensitization effects in the mass population by causing socially-accredited interpretation of cause-effect relations to violate sensuous rational interpretation of experience.”
The author offers some provocative information about Vladimir Putin as a Freemason also subject to MI-6 mind-control who freed himself. All I know if how much I do not know but I pray that Xi Jinping, Donald Trump, and Vladimir Putin are all talking and in the process of cleansing the top ranks of the Freemasons what I am told is the Chinese objective: to place the Freemasons on the side of the 99% and the creation of a prosperous world at peace that works for all.
Elitist control of the American Medical Association and the American Psychiatric Association (and follow ons, such as the morons who blessed water-boarding by the CIA) has been used to “game” mental health so that the dumbed-down obedient individual is considered “healthy” while the recalcitrant obstructionist is considered “unhealthy.” Control of these associations also enabled the repression of natural and alternative cures, substituting a panoply of drugs both legal and illegal, all intended to fragment and soften the mental and physical health of the population. Today just 1% of our youth are qualified for military service. The elite have been successful.
The authors adds to my knowledge of the breadth and depth of Nazi transplants to the CIA and to NASA, and the degree to which they were committed to mind-control, occult practices, and the liberal use of drugs to subjugate and enslave individuals. The point is made that over time research across America became so corrupted that only the collaborators survived – “honest academicians where generally weeded out and hounded into retirement.”
The central pivot in the book, from the theory to the practice to today, is chapter three, “Killing of the King,” which coherently, grippingly connects the assassination of John F. Kennedy (JFK) with all that followed including particularly the fragmentation and mind-fucking of America.
Although I have reviewed numerous books on the assassination of JFK, none have focused on Freemasons as much as this chapter does, drawing on other sources.
Reviews on Assassination of JFK
Although I have heard and read over the years of CIA and KGB Freemasons collaborating in betrayal of their countries and organizations by order of the Freemasons, this chapter more than anything I have seen before makes me wonder if we don’t need a Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) scrub of the Freemasons – of course we would have to deal with the fact that the President and virtually everyone of consequence in Congress, Justice, and the FBI is a high-ranking Freemason – which brings in the Chinese Freemasons. I know one of their leaders. Could they be the ones who finally purge global Freemasonry at the top and redirect it toward its more benign avowed goals? Or will we simply get a Chinese version of the Deep State leveraging the Freemasons outside of China to do China’s bidding?
What this chapter does is place the assassination of JFK in the context of a much larger scheme to destroy the innocence and quest for excellence that he inspired and that was inherent in the USA as “the greatest generation” left war behind, created families, and prepared to go to the moon and beyond.
The chapter is a treatise in symbolism, occult machinations, and the alchemy of a hidden government using the assassination as a form of trauma that is then followed by an orchestrated combination of music, movies, television shows, and the creation of a drug culture such that civic consciousness could be said to have been assassinated as well.
The next chapter, “The Doors of Perception: The CIA’s Psychedelic Revolution,” deepens our understanding of how the public was drugged up and dumbed down in the aftermath of the JFK assassination….by design.
I knew the lyrist for the Grateful Dead John Perry Barlow (RIP) and this I found shocking because I have continued to be naïve:
“An FBI internal memo from 1968 mentions the employment of the Grateful Dead as an avenue to ‘channel youth dissent and rebellion into more benign and non-threatening directions.’ [They] performed a vital service in distracting many young persons into drugs and mysticism, rather than politics.” He cites Jim Keith’s Mind Control, World Control (Adventures Unlimited Press, 1998), no page number. I learn that Jim Keith is the author of two other books I have not read, Mass Control: Engineering Human Consciousness (Adventures Unlimited Press, 2003), and also Secret and Suppressed: Banned Ideas and Hidden History (Feral House, 1993).
The author draws on multiple sources to show that the CIA orchestrated drug proliferation experiments at over eighty US university campuses with the intent of popularizing LSD, creating a drug counterculture that took an entire generation – or multiple generations – out of civics, out of politics. The intent was to turn people away from God and man in God’s (good) image, and instead transform America into a perverse complex of dehumanizing drug abuse, sexual perversion, and the glorification of violence. At its most extreme, the intent was to create multiple generations of murderous pedophiles and necrophiliacs. It worked.
The dumbing down of education, turning it into a rote memorization process devoid of critical thinking, to include the teaching of agnosticism, the elimination of core values – ethics – the denial of the nobility of man and the unlimited potential of man for creating heaven on Earth, the denial of “soul,” were all focused on creating an autistic population living in a virtual concentration camp. Add to this vaccines actually creating a massive number of truly autistic children, and the opioid crisis our own President has condemned, and one begins to see that we are at the tail end of a half century of deliberate genocide and ecocide. Add to this 5G and the alienation and ignorance inherent in what I have termed #GoogleGestapo, and the death knell of civilization is sounded.
It has been my horrible mistake to presume, wrongly, that information pathologies such as I have itemized in various works but with the following specific reviews (one by a guest), were calculated betrayals of the public trust but somehow isolated, temporal, reversible. I have been reading individual trees and not seeing the forest.
I have been in denial. Even in the past two years, as I have taken an interest in 9/11 and a series of false flag events and mind-controlled active shooters across the USA, I have been in denial of the obscenely broad, calculated, deep, intended, persistent nature of this organized threat to society – a threat that includes rogue elements of academia, civil society (labor unions and religions particularly), commerce, government, law enforcement, media, military, and non-government or non-profit “foundations” that turn out to be the true centers of evil.
We are at war, and the two political parties in the USA represent Satan – the repressive tolerance (anything goes including pedophilia) and authoritarian façade that has been conducting mass surveillance, militarizing the police, using false flag operations to advance an anti-gun agenda, drugging us, lying to us, all of it is “the plan.” President Donald Trump may or may not be part of the plan, as I write this I pray that his “America First” NATIONALISM will triumph and his tongue-kissing of Benjamin Netanyahu is merely a temporary deception. #UNRIG, the unity for integrity electoral reform movement I founded, I can now see is half of the solution – the other solution is a completely independent Web 3.0 that cannot be censored, where individuals cannot be lied to and also digitally assassinated, as is the case today with Amazon, Facebook, Google, MeetUp, Twitter, and YouTube.
The “left” – and Noam Chomsky does not fare well in this chapter – was creating to pre-empt the radicalization of the growing middle class and college educated youth. I am reminded of the Great Depression, which was created by the banks, with the complicity of two Presidents, to destroy the middle class rising in political power while concentrating their own power over government and buying up land at depression level prices. That story is told by my friend and brilliant economist Wayne Jett.
Review: The Fruits of Graft
The chapter on “Television” is one of the longest and most valuable. Television is how everyone is “educated” to the same low level, homogenized, made politically correct, distracted, brainwashed, and turned against everything that is the opposite of television: civics, community, country, culture, ethics, family, and more. Television is about fostering apathy and ignorance. Among the author’s contributions are the naming of names. Television is the Deep State’s voice, and I am immediately reminded of Fareed Zakaria, the most elegant whore of the Deep State on the air today.
Included in this chapter is a most interesting section suggesting that Wikileaks is an intelligence operation that has received the directed support of TIME Magazine and the media outlets under the control of Robert Murdoch, whose own public relations person is on the board of Wikileaks. One does wonder.
Also in this chapter is a segment on language as the cornerstone of independence and the observation that languages created nations, not the other way around.
The chapter concludes most compellingly in suggesting that television as it is used in the USA today is nothing more of less than a Satanic indoctrination program justifying the complete moral collapse of the Republic, and the complete emptying of the public mind of any form of constructive thinking.
The chapter on cybernetics blends CIA MKULTRA mind control with #GoogleGestapo mind control, but I am surprised to find here information about how both contraceptives and Affirmative Action were devised by the Rockefeller and other foundation as very deliberate means of destroying families.
This chapter is helpful in making it clear that globalization and liberalism (anything goes repressive tolerance) are the opposite of nationalism and family values. The line is drawn and I dare say that 2020 is going to be a turning point in American history – either we continue the Trump Revolution and defeat the Deep State and Shadow Government seeking to undermine individual and state sovereignty, or we return to the original program of national debasement and devolution.
Mental health as defined by the authorities is totally centered on obedience and credulity to lies.
UNESCO and most medicine including vaccines is about eugenics – population control to the point of genocide and the deliberate eradication of entire cultures.
The enemy of the Deep State is humanity itself.
The final chapter on “Science Fiction and the Tavistock Institute” is a fitting conclusion to a book that has truly shocked me into thinking more deeply and more urgently about the challenges that face humanity in 2020 and beyond.
I am completely persuaded that saving the family, the community, the individual states and provinces and the larger nation-stations including particularly the United STATES of America (anyone calling for the end of the Electoral College is either an idiot or a traitor), is our millennial challenge.
I am persuaded that my concept for Open Source Everything Engineering (OSEE), including the truth & wisdom channel that cannot be censored in which individuals cannot be digitally assassinated, and the engineering revolution that restores power to the distributed public and ends the ability of banks and lawyers to impoverish the public (while achieving Buckminster Fuller’s concept of ephemeralism, doing more with less), is the other half of the solution (beyond #UNRIG). The human individual, optimized to exercise free will and independent discovery, is the opposite of the fascist corporate top-down controlled economy of, by, and for the Satanic elite. Open, not closed systems, are necessary to enable humanity to achieve its cosmic destiny.
I will end with three reviews I have done that make it clear that the future of humanity depends on localization, not globalization. I believe this strongly and I will spend the rest of my life fighting the Deep State and seeking to empower the individual, the family, the local community, and the sovereign state, in that order. Bottom up, not top down, must be our generative guiding principle.

MOSCOW – The Arctic version of the Russian anti-aircraft missile system Tor can also be used effectively in the tropics and desert , said Fanil Ziyatdinov, director general of the Kupol electromechanical plant (Almaz-Antei consortium) to Sputnik agency.
Fanil Ziyatdinov, general director of the Kupol electromechanical plant in the Russian city of Izhevsk and specializing in air defense equipment, noted that the Tor system is fully adapted to combat in extreme weather conditions.
“Having all the capabilities of recognizing and launching the basic model of the Tor-M2 system, the arctic modification of this system is fully adapted for operations in extreme climatic conditions, not only in the Arctic but also in the tropics and deserts,” said Ziyatdinov.
According to him, the system is installed on the chassis of the DT-30 Vityaz, a two-section articulated off-road amphibious vehicle on tracks.
“ This system can operate in poor road conditions, on rough terrain, covered with snow and ice, in sands, swamps and overcome water obstacles. All the necessary conditions have been created so that the crew can operate the system efficiently.
“As well, the armaments of these anti-aircraft missile systems were adapted to these conditions,” said the agency’s interlocutor.
Previously, the Russian Defense Ministry reported that the first batch of Tor-M2DT (Arctic version) anti-aircraft missile systems has already been delivered to the Russian Armed Forces. – Advertisement –
Russia’s anti-aircraft defense systems will be invisible to enemy forces, Valery Makeev, executive director of the Nudelman Precision Engineering Development Agency, said last week.
According to Makeev, this will be possible thanks to a passive station of circular vision that does not emit electromagnetic radiation and causes the systems not to be detected .
“Over the past three years, we have been conducting development activities to create electro-optical circular vision systems. The process is almost over, and the state tests have had a positive result,”he said.
One of the main features of this system is to be passive – it does not emit electromagnetic radiation and because of this, enemy forces are not able to detect and destroy it.
“In all of today’s conflicts, air defense systems, which are detectable due to electromagnetic emissions, are first destroyed, and after that the air force does its work. But if the system, equipped with the new missiles guided by laser Sosna, owning this station, everything will be different,” he explained.
Makeev emphasized that by integrating the passive complex of circular vision into the Sosna system, the Army will obtain a unique, completely passive air defense system with a high survivability.
He also added that this device can be installed in land and sea air defense complexes as well as being deployed autonomously in protected facilities.

Is Turkey Buying Russian S-400 as Part of NATO Exit Plan?,www.therussophile.org,Paul Antonopoulos,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/is-turkey-buying-russian-s-400-as-part-of-nato-exit-plan.html/,"This post was originally published on this site
ANKARA – The purchase by Turkey of the Russian S-400 anti-aircraft systems could not lead to the expulsion of Ankara from NATO, Turkish experts say.
“ I do not think the S-400 agreement is a reason for Turkey’s exclusion from NATO ,” said Huseyin Alptekin, a researcher on the strategic program of the Foundation for Political, Economic and Social Research (SETA) on the sidelines of the club’s Valdai of International Discussions.
At the same time, Enes Bayrakli, director of SETA’s European Studies Program, pointed out that no one, neither in NATO nor in Turkey, is serious about speculation about a possible withdrawal of Ankara from the alliance over the purchase of the S-400s.
“Turkey’s contribution to NATO is irreplaceable, NATO would be completely different if Turkey left the organization. They would not replace Turkey with anyone, for them the damage would be enormous ,” he said.
Hasan Basri Yalcin, director of SETA’s strategic research program, pointed out that Turkey is “a reliable security provider for NATO,” but Ankara does not want to become “a NATO satellite. For Turkey it is unacceptable,” he added. – Advertisement –
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Aleksandr Grushko said the United States, in demanding that Turkey renounce Russia’s S-400 anti-aircraft systems, is pursuing “obvious” economic interest.
“The pressure that the United States exerts on Turkey is not surprising … They are pursuing an obvious economic interest ,” Grushko told a news conference.
Grushko noted that the US is very interested in Turkey and other allies buying exclusively US arms, and that is why they demand that they increase their military budgets by 2%.
“If this American demand is met,” the diplomat explained, “NATO’s budget would reach the astronomical value of $400 billion, of which $100 billion, would have to be used for the purchase of American weapons.”
US Vice President Mike Pompeo said on 3 April that Turkey’s purchase of Russian S-400 anti-aircraft systems is a major concern in the US and poses a threat to NATO unity. In addition, he urged Turkey to make a choice: to remain an important alliance partner or compromise its security by making “reckless” decisions and “undermining” NATO.

American Meritocracy Is a Myth,www.therussophile.org,Ashley Roberts,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/american-meritocracy-is-a-myth.html/,"This post was originally published on this site Recent scandals in politics and higher education show how the rich perpetuate inequality in the US.
Rajan MENON
Despair about the state of our politics pervades the political spectrum, from left to right. One source of it, the narrative of fairness offered in basic civics textbooks—we all have an equal opportunity to succeed if we work hard and play by the rules; citizens can truly shape our politics—no longer rings true to most Americans. Recent surveys indicate that substantial numbers of them believe that the economy and political system are both rigged. They also think that money has an outsize influence on politics. Ninety percent of Democrats hold this view, but so do 80 percent of Republicans. And careful studies confirm what the public believes.
None of this should be surprising given the stark economic inequality that now marks our society. The richest 1 percent of American households currently account for 40 percent of the country’s wealth, more than the bottom 90 percent of families possess. Worse yet, the top 0.1 percent has cornered about 20 percent of it, up from 7 percent in the mid-1970s. By contrast, the share of the bottom 90 percent has since then fallen from 35 percent to 25 percent. To put such figures in a personal light, in 2017, three men —Jeff Bezos, Warren Buffett, and Bill Gates—possessed more wealth ($248.5 billion) than the bottom 50 percent of Americans.
Over the last four decades, economic disparities in the United States increased substantially and are now greater than those in other wealthy democracies. The political consequence has been that a tiny minority of extremely wealthy Americans wields disproportionate influence, leaving so many others feeling disempowered.
WHAT MONEY SOUNDS LIKE
Two recent headline-producing scandals highlight money’s power in society and politics.
The first involved super-affluent parents who used their wealth to get their manifestly unqualified children into highly selective colleges and universities that previously had reputations (whatever the reality) for weighing the merits of applicants above their parents’ wealth or influence.
The second concerned Texas Senator Ted Cruz’s reported failure to reveal, as election laws require, more than $1 million in low-interest loans that he received for his 2012 Senate campaign. (For that lapse, the Federal Election Commission (FEC) fined Senator Cruz a modest $35,000.) The funds came from Citibank and Goldman Sachs, the latter his wife’s longtime employer. News of those undisclosed loans, which also cast doubt on Cruz’s claim that he had funded his campaign in part by liquidating the couple’s assets, only added to the sense that favoritism now suffuses the politics of a country that once prided itself on being the world’s model democracy. (Journalists covering the story couldn’t resist pointing out that the senator had often lambasted Wall Street’s “ crony capitalism ” and excessive political influence.)
The Cruz controversy is just one reflection of the coming of 1 percent politics and 1 percent elections to America at a moment when the first billionaire has been ensconced in the Oval Office for more than two years, posing as a populist no less.
CURRENT ISSUE Since the Supreme Court’s 2010 ruling in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission , money has poured into politics as never before. That’s because the Court ruled that no limits could be placed on corporate and union spending aimed at boosting or attacking candidates running for political office. Doing so, the justices determined in a 5-4 vote, would be tantamount to restricting individuals’ right to free speech, protected by the First Amendment . Then came the Court’s 2014 McCutcheon v. Federal Election Commission decision (again 5-4), which only increased money’s influence in politics by removing the aggregate limit on an individual’s contribution to candidates and to national party committees.
In an age when money drives politics, even ex-presidents are cashing in. Fifteen years after Bill Clinton departed the White House, he and Hillary had amassed a net worth of $75 million—a 6,150 percent increase in their wealth. Barack and Michelle Obama’s similarly soared from $1.3 million in 2000 to $40 million last year—and they’re just warming up. Key sources of these staggering increases include sky-high speaking fees (often paid by large corporations), including $153 million for the Clintons between February 2001 and May 2016. George W. Bush also made tens of millions of dollars in this fashion and, in 2017, Obama received $400,000 for a single speech to a Wall Street firm.
No wonder average Americans believe that the political class is disconnected from their day-to-day lives and that ours is, in practice, a democracy of the rich in which money counts (and counts and counts).
CASH FOR COLLEGE
Now let’s turn to what those two recent scandals tell us about the nexus between wealth and power in America.
First, the school scam. Parents have long hired pricey tutors to coach their children for the college admissions tests, sometimes paying them hundreds of dollars an hour, even $1,500 for 90 minutes of high-class prep. They’ve also long tapped their exclusive social and political connections to gin up razzle-dazzle internships to embellish those college applications. Anyone who has spent as much time in academia as I have knows that this sort of thing has been going on for a long time. So has the practice of “ legacy admissions ”—access to elite schools especially for the kids of alumni of substantial means who are, or might prove to be, donors . The same is true of privileged access to elite schools for the kids of mega-donors. Consider, for instance, that $2.5 million donation Charles Kushner made to Harvard in 1998, not long before his son Jared applied. Some of the folks who ran Jared’s high school noted that he wasn’t exactly a whiz-bang student or someone with sky-high SAT scores, but—surprise!—he was accepted anyway.
What’s new about the recent revelations is that they show the extent to which today’s deep-pocketed helicopter parents have gone into overdrive, using brazen schemes to corrupt the college admissions process yet more. One unnamed parent spent a cool $6.5 million to ensure the right college admitted his or her child. Others paid hefty amounts to get their kids’ college admissions test scores falsified or even hired proxies to take the tests for them. Famous actors and financial titans made huge payments to university sports coaches, who then lied to admissions officers, claiming that the young applicants were champions they had recruited in sports like water polo, crew, or tennis. (The kids may have known how to swim, row, or play tennis, but star athletes they were not .) Of course, as figures on the growing economic inequality in this country since the 1970s indicate, the overwhelming majority of Americans lack the connections or the cash to stack the deck in such ways, even assuming they would do so. Hence, the public outrage, even though parents generally understand that not every aspirant can get into a top school—there aren’t enough spots—just as many know that their childrens’ future happiness and sense of fulfillment won’t depend on whether they attend a prestigious college or university.
Still, the unfairness and chicanery highlighted by the admissions scandal proved galling, the more so as the growing crew of fat cats corrupting the admissions process doubtless also preach the gospel of American meritocracy. Worse, most of their kids will undoubtedly present their fancy degrees as proof that quality wins out in our society, never mind that their starting blocks were placed so far ahead of the competition.
To add insult to injury, the same parents and children may even portray admissions policies designed to help students who lack wealth or come from underrepresented communities as violations of the principles of equal opportunity and fairness, democracy’s bedrock. In reality, students from low-income families, or even those of modest means, are startlingly less likely to be admitted to top private universities than those from households in the top 10 percent. In fact, applicants from families in the top 1 percent are now 77 times more likely than in the bottom 20 percent to land in an elite college, and 38 of those schools admit more kids from families in that top percentage than from the bottom 60 percent.
BUYING POLITICS (AND POLITICIANS), AMERICAN-STYLE
Now, let’s return to the political version of the same—the world in which Ted Cruz swims so comfortably. There, too, money talks, which means that those wealthy enough to gain access to, and the attention of, lawmakers have huge advantages over others. If you want political influence, whether as a person or a corporation, having the wealth needed to make big campaign contributions—to individuals or groups—and to hire top-drawer lobbyists makes a world of difference.
Official data on the distribution of family income in the United States show that the overwhelming majority of Americans can’t play that game, which remains the preserve of a tiny super-rich minority. In 2015, even with taxes and government-provided benefits included, households in the lowest 20 percent accounted for only about 5 percent of total income. Their average income—not counting taxes and government-provided assistance—was only $20,000. The share of the bottom 50 percent—families making $61,372 or less— dropped from 20 percent to 12 percent between 1978 and 2015. By contrast, families in the top 1 percent earned nearly 50 percent of total income, averaging $215,000 a year—and that’s only income, not wealth. The super-rich have plenty of the latter, those in the bottom 20 percent next to none.
Before we proceed, a couple of caveats about money and political clout. Money doesn’t always prevail. Candidates with more campaign funds aren’t guaranteed victory, though the time politicians spend raising cash leaves no doubt that they believe it makes a striking difference. In addition, money in politics doesn’t operate the way simple bribery does. The use of it in pursuit of political influence works more subtly, and often—in the new era opened by the Supreme Court—without the slightest need to violate the law.
Still, in Donald Trump’s America, who would claim that money doesn’t talk? If nothing else, from inaugural events—for Trump’s inaugural $107 million was raised from a host of wealthy donors with no limits on individual payments, 30 of which totaled $1 million or more—to gala fundraisers, big donors get numerous opportunities to schmooze with those whose campaigns they’ve helped bankroll. Yes, there’s a limit— currently $5,600—on how much any individual can officially give to a single election campaign, but the ultra-wealthy can simply put their money into organizations formed solely to influence elections as well as into various party committees.
Individuals, companies, and organizations can, for instance, give money to political action committees (PACs) and Super PACs. Though bound by rules , both entities still have lots of leeway. PACs face no monetary limits on their independent efforts to shape elections, though they can’t accept corporate or union money or take more than $5,000 from individuals. They can provide up to $5,000 to individual election campaigns and $15,000 per party committee, but there’s no limit on what they can contribute in the aggregate. Super PACs have far more running room. They can rake in unlimited amounts from a variety of sources (as long as they’re not foreign) and, like PACs, can spend limitless sums to shape elections, providing they don’t give money directly to candidates’ campaigns.
Then there are the dark money groups, which can receive financial contributions from any source, American or foreign. Though their primary purpose is to push policies, not individual campaigns, they can engage in election-related work, provided that no more than half their funds are devoted to it. Though barred from donating to individual campaigns, they can pour unlimited money into Super PACs and, unlike PACs and Super PACs, don’t have to disclose who gave them the money or how much. Between 2008 and 2018, dark money groups spent $1 billion to influence elections.
In 2018 , 2,395 Super PACs were working their magic in this country. They raised $1.6 billion and spent nearly $809 million. Nearly 78 percent of the money they received came from 100 donors . They, in turn, belonged to the wealthiest 1 percent, who provided 95 percent of what those Super PACs took in.
As the 2018 congressional elections kicked off, the four wealthiest Super PACs alone had $113.4 million on hand to support candidates they favored, thanks in substantial measure to business world donors. In that election cycle, 31 individuals ponied up more than $5 million apiece, while contributions from the top four among them ranged from almost $40 million to $123 million.
The upshot: If you’re running for office and advocate policies disliked by wealthy individuals or by companies and organizations with lots of cash to drop into politics, you know from the get-go that you now have a problem.
Wealth also influences political outcomes through the lobbying industry. Here again, there are rules, but even so, vast numbers of lobbyists and eye-popping amounts of lobbying money now are at the heart of the American political system. In 2018 alone , the 50 biggest lobbying outfits, largely representing big companies, business associations, and banks, spent $540 million, and the grand total for lobbying that year alone was $3.4 billion.
Nearly 350 of those lobbyists were former legislators from Congress. Officials departing from senior positions in the executive branch have also found artful ways to circumvent presidential directives that prohibit them from working as lobbyists for a certain number of years.
Do unions and public interest groups also lobby? Sure, but there’s no contest between them and corporations. Lee Drutman of the New America think tank notes that, for every dollar the former spent in 2015, corporate donors spent $34. Unsurprisingly, only one of the top 20 spenders on lobbying last year was a union or a public-interest organization.
The sums spent by individual companies to gain political influence can be breathtaking. Take now-embattled Boeing . It devoted $15 million to lobbying in 2018—and that’s not counting its campaign contributions, using various channels. Those added another $8.4 million in the last two-and-a-half years. Yet Boeing only placed 11th among the top 20 corporate spenders on lobbying last year. Leading the pack: the US Chamber of Commerce at $94.8 million.
Defenders of the status quo will warn that substantially reducing money’s role in American politics is sure to threaten democracy and civil liberties by ceding undue power to the state and, horror of horrors, putting us on the road to “socialism,” the right wing’s bogeyman du jour. This is ludicrous. Other democracies have taken strong steps to prevent economic inequality from subverting their politics and haven’t become less free as a result. Even those democracies that don’t limit political contributions have adopted measures to curb the power of money, including bans on television ads (a huge expense for candidates in American elections: $3 billion in 2018 alone just for access to local stations), free airtime to allow competitors to disseminate their messages, and public funds to ease the financial burden of election campaigns. Compared to other democracies, the United States appears to be in a league of its own when it comes to money’s prominence in politics.
Those who favor continuing business as usual like to point out that federal “matching funds” exist to help presidential candidates not be steamrolled by competitors who’ve raised mounds of money. Those funds, however, do no such thing because they come with stringent limits on total spending. Candidates who accept matching funds for a general election cannot accept contributions from individuals. Moreover, matching funds are capped at $20 million, which is a joke considering that Barack Obama and Mitt Romney spent a combined $1.2 billion in individual contributions alone during the 2012 presidential election. ( Super PACs spent another $350 million to help Romney and $100 million to back Obama.)
A NEW AMERICAN TRADITION?
Rising income inequality , wage stagnation , and slowing social mobility hurt ordinary Americans economically, even as they confer massive social and political advantages on the mega-rich—and not just when it comes to college admissions and politics either.
Even The Economist, a publication that can’t be charged with sympathy for left-wing ideas, warned recently of the threat economic inequality poses to the political agency of American citizens. The magazine cited studies showing that, despite everything you’ve heard about the power of small donations in recent political campaigns, 1 percent of the population actually provides a quarter of all the money spent on politics by individuals and 80 percent of what the two major political parties raise. Thanks to their wealth, a minuscule economic elite as well as big corporations now shape policies, notably on taxation and expenditure, to their advantage on an unprecedented scale. Polls show that an overwhelming majority of Americans support stricter laws to prevent wealth from hijacking politics and want the Citizens United ruling overturned . But then just how much does the voice of the majority matter? Judging from the many failed efforts to pass such laws, not much."
Why “Russiagate” Is the Same as “WMD in Iraq” for America”s Mainstream Media,www.therussophile.org,Ashley Roberts,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/why-russiagate-is-the-same-as-wmd-in-iraq-for-americas-mainstream-media.html/,"This post was originally published on this site
America’s Democratic Party ‘news’-media are now defending themselves against charges that they had trumpeted false allegations against Donald Trump regarding “Russiagate.” Republican Party ‘news’-media are strutting because they didn’t. But in the lead-up to America’s invasion and destruction of Iraq (and here’s “ How the US Destroyed Iraq” ), the mainstream ‘news’-reporting was just as bad then as now, only with the partisan sides switched. The chief difference between then and now is only that the media now have been fictitiously demonizing Putin and Trump by means of lies, whereas back in 2002 and 2003, they were fictitiously demonizing Saddam Hussein by means of lies.
In that prior instance (lies about Iraq), the Republican media were the worse of the two Party-propaganda-lines . Republican Party followers were the more-deceived back then , just as Democratic Party followers are the more-deceived today . Whereas, in 2003 , increased exposure to news, about what had led up to the invasion of Iraq, produced, for Democrats, higher scores on a test of knowledge about that matter; for Republicans, it actually produced lower scores about that matter. For Republicans, at that time, the ‘news’-reporting decreased , rather than increased, a historically accurate understanding of the lead-up to (and into) Iraq-invasion events. By contrast, now in 2019, when the evidence has finally become clear that the Russiagate accusations against Trump were intensely politically motivated, it is Democratic Party followers who are the more-deceived today . In fact, whereas, back in January of this year, 83% of Republicans said that the reason for the Russiagate investigation was “politically motivated,” 84% of Democrats said that it was not . The more that Democrats had become influenced by Democratic-Party ‘news’-media, the more inaccurate their understandings of the events were. On this matter, Democrats were oblivious about the reality, just swamped by their own Party’s propaganda — just like had happened to Republicans regarding the invasion of Iraq.
In both of these two instances (both Democratic ‘news’-media now, and Republican ‘news’-media then), all of America’s major media actually hid — and continue to hide — the key facts, from the public (even 16 years, now, after the invasion of Iraq). On the deeper-level issues concerning Governmental policies, there is bipartisan deceit against the American public . These are issues on which all of the billionaires were and are united, against the American public (and especially against the “40.6% million people in poverty” — the neediest instead of the richest who are themselves, those billionaires), and they therefore benefit from the public’s ignorance and misconceptions about such matters (so that the Government will continue serving chiefly themselves). These super-rich are determined to continue controlling Government-policies, for their own benefits, like increased ‘defense’ spending to buy increased products from their corporations such as Lockheed Martin, and for increased access to raw materials by their firms such as ExxonMobil. It’s all — according to their propaganda-media, ‘in defense of freedom and democracy and human rights’. That’s always the billionaires’ line. It’s always “Trust us!” “Our Government is democratic — a democracy, not a dictatorship [ by us]!” So, the message from them is: invade Iraq! And: oppose any US President who would meet privately to negotiate with Russia’s President! America’s billionaires fear peace abroad. They thrive on conquest (their coups and invasions) abroad. For example, this is the reason why, consistently in Gallup’s findings , “The military” (which is actually the most corrupt of all American institutions ) scores, by far, at the very top of the 17 listed “Institutions” in American society — way above (for examples) “the Supreme Court,“ or “The church or organized religion,” or “The public schools.” The billionaires shape the culture, and this is how they’ve managed to get the US to spend about half of the entire world’s total military expenses — all to be paid for by the taxes and governmental debts that the public (and their descendants), and not merely those billionaires (the actual beneficiaries ) pay, and will be paying in the future. This is the way that a global empire is built, and maintained — ‘for peace and freedom and democracy and human rights around the world’.
The two Parties disagree with each other, but each Party represents only a different faction among the billionaires (not among the public) regarding what they want the public to believe. The billionaires and their corporations contribute the vast majority of the money to the major candidates, and control the think tanks and ‘news’-media that enables each winning national US politician to become and remain a winning national US politician and thus to become and be the President , or member of Congress. So, these few extremely wealthy individuals are America’s real, behind-the-scenes, government — the “Deep State” that’s represented by the top levels at CIA, Britain’s MI6, Wall Street, etc. (all servants — a few of whom are billionaires themselves — of America’s billionaires, and of their allied foreign billionaires).
No faction within America’s 585 billionaires actually represents the American public — neither group of billionaires (Democrats or Republicans) represents the public of either Party. Each of them represents only him-or-her-self and the property (and employees and other agents) which that individual controls. (Of course, that’s millions of people, who are hired and promoted and demoted by the billionaires.) But because billionaires’ wealth is so extremely concentrated within this tiny number of people (585), and is so huge, and because their corruption reigns , these few individuals effectively control the Government . Especially America’s foreign policies (including, in 2002, toward Iraq; and, in 2016-18, ‘Russiagate’, toward Russia and Trump) represent only the interests of billionaires, not of the American people, who are mainly interested in domestic affairs, such as health care, education, crimes, etc.
Right now, the billionaires are (via their media-proxies) battling each other over whom to blame for ‘Russiagate’: if not Trump, then whom? But that’s only a Democrat-versus-Republican issue. It appeals to the partisans on each side. It’s more of the same, so that the billionaires’ control over America’s Government continues to face no challenge .
Whenever American billionaires’ desires contradict the public’s needs, the latter have “a minuscule, near-zero, statistically non-significant impact upon public policy” , and this has been scientifically proven to have been true since at least 1981. Though it’s true regarding any field of public policy, it is the most true regarding international policies, because those are the ones on which deceiving the public is the easiest to do. Furthermore, the controlling owners of international corporations (and these are billionaires) are vastly more concerned about foreign affairs than the general public is. Whereas domestic affairs interest everyone, foreign affairs receive far less attention from most people — but not from billionaires, who are, if anything, often even more interested in those matters.
Donald Trump represents one faction of America’s billionaires; Barack Obama represented another faction of them; but each President (at least since 1981) has been representing only them (America’s billionaires). Furthermore, the 2016 Presidential contest was no exception to this rule ; and, so, American democracy has been destroyed by America’s own billionaires, and not by any foreign country. Russia didn’t do this to us. Not even Israel (which interferes in American national elections vastly more than does Russia , and which also has officially the fourth-largest of all foreign nations’ lobbies in the US Congress ) did. America’s billionaires did (and do) it. Overwhelmingly, it is they who actually control America’s foreign policies. (Moreover, on international matters, there appears to be virtual unanimity amongst the aristocracies of Britain, Israel, and US; and, on 15 February 2009, Britain’s Guardian reported that “The pro-Israel lobby’s contributions reach a majority of US politicians. In 2018, it spent money on 269 representatives’ and 57 senators’ campaigns, and gave to Democrats at a two to one ratio.” So: it’s not only the Republican Party that’s fronting for Israel. To front for Israel is also to front for America’s billionaires — even for the roughly 70% of America’s non -Jewish billionaires . But to front for Russia is ‘traitorous’ while to front for Israel is ‘not’ — and yet Russia never attacked and slaughtered Americans, whereas Israel did , and so did another ‘US ally’, Saudi Arabia. (Yet, America’s aristocracy is closely allied with both Israel’s and Saudi Arabia’s — not just with Britain’s.)
All of these assertions will be further documented and exemplified in what follows.
The two examples to be focused upon here will be America’s successful rape of Iraq in 2003, and the Democratic Party’s unsuccessful effort, which started in 2016, to delegitimize the Republican President Donald Trump as being some type of Russian agent.
The invasion of Iraq in 2003
Here’s Robert Mueller testifying to Congress about WMD (weapons of mass destruction) in Iraq, before we invaded and destroyed Iraq:
On 11 February 2003, the then-FBI Director Mueller testified , to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence , that: “Secretary Powell presented evidence last week that Baghdad has failed to disarm its weapons of mass destruction, willfully attempting to evade and deceive the international community. Our particular concern is that Saddam may supply al-Qaeda with biological, chemical, or radiological material.”
He just reiterated the President’s lies (and he credited Colin Powell’s supposed naiveté in having spouted them — for which deception Powell subsequently apologized, but Mueller never did). Mueller’s concern wasn’t to raise any question about the lies that led to the Iraq-invasion, but was simply to reinforce these lies. He didn’t work for the public. He worked for the President.
As I said 16 September 2016 :
On 7 September 2002, US President George W. Bush blatantly lied to concoct a “new report” by the IAEA about Saddam Hussein’s weapons of mass destruction program, and the US news-media reported the statement but hid that it was a lie. He said (and CNN and others quoted it): “a report came out of the Atomic — the IAEA that they were six months away from developing a weapon. I don’t know what more evidence we need,” when he was asked at a press conference, “Mr. President, can you tell us what conclusive evidence of any nuclear — new evidence you have of nuclear weapons capabilities of Saddam Hussein?” Immediately, the IAEA said then that there was no such “new report,” and that the last they were able to find, there was nothing left of WMD in Iraq. The American news-media simply ignored the IAEA’s denial, and we invaded Iraq, almost six months after that boldfaced lie, a lie the press refused to expose, at all — ever. They still haven’t exposed it, even to the present day; and instead there remains a ‘debate’ as to whether George W. Bush lied or was instead merely misled by “defective US intelligence.” In this particular instance, he wasn’t even citing US intelligence, but instead citing the IAEA, and they immediately denied it, but the press failed to report that fact; so, really, the President was simply lying, and the press just continue to lie by saying he had only “been misled by the CIA” (which he actually controlled; but he didn’t control the IAEA). The American press hide the fact that the American President lied his nation into invading Iraq. The press lie that it was only “bad intelligence,” no lying President.
(Because of the news-media’s ignoring the IAEA’s denial of the President’s statement, the author of the IAEA’s denial, Mark Gwozdecky, spoke three weeks later, by phone, with the only journalist who was interested, Joseph Curl of the Washington Times, who headlined on 27 September 2002, “Agency Disavows Report on Iraq Arms” — perhaps that should instead have been “President Lied About ‘Saddam’s WMD’” — and Curl quoted Gwozdecky: “There’s never been a report like that [which Bush alleged] issued from this agency… When we left in December ’98 we had concluded that we had neutralized their nuclear-weapons program. We had confiscated their fissile material. We had destroyed all their key buildings and equipment.” Other news-media failed to pick up Curl’s article. And, even in that article, there was no clear statement that the President had, in fact, lied — cooked up an IAEA ‘report’ that never actually existed — and that he never corrected his false allegation; that he compounded his lie by not correcting it.)
This is hardly the only instance where the US news-media cover for the President’s lies about foreign affairs, by merely stenographically reporting what he says, while hiding the truth that his statement was a baldfaced lie. For example, how many times have you read in the newspapers, or in a magazine, or seen on TV, or heard on the radio (all of which are supposed to report these things), that in February 2014, the Obama Administration perpetrated a bloody coup d’etat that overthrew the democratically elected President of Ukraine, and replaced his government with a racist-fascist, or anti-Russian nazi, government , so that Ukraine, which had been at peace for decades, was now suddenly torn by a racist bloody civil war — a war of ethnic cleansing ? Oh? You were instead told that ‘democracy’ started (instead of ended) when Ukraine’s President Viktor Yanukovych was overthrown then, in a ‘revolution,’ not in any US “coup”?
The very next day, on 8 September 2002, the New York Times bannered “THREATS AND RESPONSES: THE IRAQIS; US SAYS HUSSEIN INTENSIFIES QUEST FOR A-BOMB PARTS” , and reported that, “In the last 14 months, Iraq has sought to buy thousands of specially designed aluminum tubes, which American officials believe were intended as components of centrifuges to enrich uranium.” That, too, turned out to be fiction, which the ‘news’-media stenographically reported to be reality, as any propaganda-agency is paid or otherwise rewarded to do.
Also on September 8th, Bush’s National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice said on CNN, “We don’t want the smoking gun to be a mushroom cloud.”
On 9 September 2002, the IAEA denied the existence of the ‘new report’ that Bush (seconded by British Prime Minister Tony Blair) had just said was proof that Saddam was within six months of having a nuclear bomb. Neither the NYT nor other ‘news’-media reported that the President had lied on September 7th. So, Gwozdecky of IAEA tried again, on September 27th, but the NYT and all the others continued to ignore them. That (the US President’s deceiving this nation into an invasion) wasn’t included to report — wasn’t even buried (like on an inside page) — in “All the News That’s Fit to Print” . Did the NYT (and WP and CNN, etc,) lose subscribers, and go out of business, for that serial-deceit of the public? The opposite: they thrived. And, now, they accuse smaller news-media (which had had had nothing to do with deceiving Americans into invading Iraq) of providing ‘fake news’ . And the standards of American ‘journalism’ are just as poor today as they were back in 2002 and 2003.
Then, on 8 October 2002, President Bush delivered, to the nation, his major address on why we needed to invade Iraq very soon. He said: “Facing clear evidence of peril, we cannot wait for the final proof, the smoking gun, that could come in the form of a mushroom cloud.” Condoleezza Rice’s fictitious “mushroom cloud” was now — exactly a month later — President Bush’s, too.
On 18 March 2003, President Bush ordered the UN’s weapons-inspectors out of Iraq by telling them that if they wouldn’t be gone within 48 hours they’d be under US bombing there . Hans Blix and his team rushed out, to meet that deadline. The Iraqi people couldn’t do any such thing — Bush’s warning simply spelt doom for them.
Nobody in the mainstream press, at the time, or afterward, reported that the IAEA had actually issued no such ‘new report’. It didn’t exist, at all. The American public didn’t know that Bush was lying through his teeth and that this invasion was 100% a blatant international war-crime. They didn’t know, because the billionaires’ American ‘news’-media hid that fact.
All of these ‘news’ lies are stenographic ‘reporting’, and it’s endemic in all of America’s mainstream ‘news’-media, all of which are controlled by billionaires, via ownership and/or their corporations’ advertising. Stenographic ‘news’-reporting is still as acceptable to them as it was to them then, when we invaded and destroyed Iraq, on the basis of those stenographically reported lies from the Government and its agents.
That’s America’s mainstream. Many in alternative, smaller, news-media had reported over and over and over and over and over and over — and even Rupert Murdoch’s own London Times had reported as early as 26 November 2009 (after the Republican President Bush was no longer in office and had been replaced by a Democrat) — that all of the insiders had known that Iraq didn’t have weapons of mass destruction (WMDs). What all of the mainstream ‘news’-media were publishing, back in 2003, were merely lies from the Government. What should have been the first question, then, on 9 September 2002 when the IAEA said that there wasn’t any “new report” from them, about the matter such as the US President had alleged? The questions were never asked, much less followed up immediately to expose the response to be yet another lie. This is how Bush and his team got away with mass-murder abroad. There was no resistance, in any of the mainstream (the billionaire-controlled) media. Not even in the Democratic-Party ‘news’-media. This was bipartisan evil (by the billionaires) and ignorance (by the public).
On 22 January 2018, CNN reported that , “George W. Bush’s favorable rating has grown from 33% to 61% since he left office. … Most of Bush’s climb back to popularity came from Democrats and independents. His favorability mark among Democrats has soared from only 11% in February 2009 to a majority 54% now.” Maybe that’s because of ‘news’-media such as CNN, continuing to trumpet ongoing official deceits as if those were instead established truths. The US Government can lie as much as it wants, because there’s nothing to stop it from lying. There is no accountability in an aristocracy, but only in a democracy (and the US is an aristocracy ).
The media-mainstream, and its supporters, refuse to become honest. Mainstreamers think that they’re terrific as they are, and certainly shouldn’t be put out of business for the mass-murdering lies they’ve pumped. The ‘Russiagate’ fraud is the latest example of this. If it had succeeded, then not only would US ‘defense’-spending soar even more and the Government’s domestic spending plunge, but World War III against Russia would suddenly become enormously more likely.
Russiagate-Trump
On 23 March 2019, main conclusions from the Mueller Report — the report from US Special Counsel Robert Swan Mueller III — became published . Democratic Party politicians and ‘news’-media were shocked and stunned that Mueller’s report asserted : “[T]he investigation did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.” One needs to see the complete sentence, there, not just part of it (which is all that was released ); but, if this quotation from the Report isn’t out-of-context, then the entire investigation was pursuing a Democratic Party lie and found it to be a lie.
On 24 March 2019, Michael Calderone at Politico said that “while fair-minded criticism can be beneficial to the news media, there are likely to also be bad faith attempts to delegitimize journalism.” He said there “journalism,” instead of “propaganda.” He was writing propaganda for America’s Democratic-Party ‘news’-media. Calderone was happy to report that “Some journalists have already pushed back on the weekend criticism. ‘Given the issues, stakes, and seriousness with which special counsel treated all of this, the media’s coverage of Russia-Trump connection and possible obstruction over the last two years was somewhere between about right and not quite aggressive enough,’ tweeted Esquire’s Ryan Lizza.” On the same day, Paul Farhi of the Washington Post headlined “Conclusion of Mueller probe raises anew criticisms of coverage” and reported that “Among the theories commentators advanced was one by New York magazine writer Jonathan Chait, who speculated in a cover story in July about whether ‘the dark crevices of the Russia scandal run not just a little deeper but a lot deeper.’ … In a statement Sunday night, Chait stood by his article. ‘That story relied on reports in credible public sources. None of those reports have been refuted.’” That’s rabidly false, though the top editors at both the Washington Post and the New York Times were quoted there as making similar false assertions. Farhi continued: “In fact, revelations by the Times and The Washington Post about contacts between Russian agents and Trump’s campaign advisers in 2016 helped prompt the inquiry that the special counsel took over in May 2017. The two newspapers shared a Pulitzer Prize for their reporting on the issue that year.” He seemed to be actually bragging about his very successful and severely failed ‘news’-paper and its main competitor.
On March 25 th , Amy Chozick in the New York Times bannered “After Mueller Report, News Media Leaders Defend Their Work” , and she reported that, “Jeff Zucker, president of CNN, said he was ‘entirely comfortable’ with the network’s coverage. ‘We are not investigators. We are journalists, and our role is to report the facts as we know them, which is exactly what we did,’ Mr. Zucker said in an email.” Furthermore: “Ben Smith, the editor in chief of BuzzFeed News, defended coverage of the Russian investigation, including the decision to publish a dossier put together by British intelligence officer Christopher Steele full of tantalizing (and unsubstantiated) reports about Russian efforts to blackmail Mr. Trump. ‘It’s pretty hard to imagine a scenario in which people were aware of its existence but not allowed to see it,’ Mr. Smith said of the dossier.” Smith took seriously the “unsubstantiated” ‘dossier’ that the DNC had hired for creating the myth that the cause of Clinton’s loss was Putin and Russia, instead of herself, and her profoundly corrupt Party (no different, basically, from the Republican Party).
On March 26 th , The Hill headlined “Media have account to settle with American people over Mueller investigation coverage” , and a journalism professor said that the news industry” had been “stumbling around unsuccessfully in the dark trying to find fact nuggets on which to build the Mueller story.” Two days later, he told Wisconsin Public Radio that “The media did underperform over the last couple of years.” The problem was just blunders , and ‘underperformance’ (instead of its long-proven-normal performance) — not the entire corrupt system of ‘ journalism ’ in America, where the people who do the hiring are answerable ultimately to the same billionaires who effectively control the Government. No — not that — not at all (according to him).
As I have pointed out and documented (via links to solid ultimate sources, sometimes in the linked-to sources in linked-to articles, but all ultimate sources having been very carefully verified by this reporter as being true, and those sources remaining solid), “All US Gov’t. Accusations Against Russia’s Gov’t. Are Lies.” That’s right: all of “Russiagate” is based on very dubious ‘evidence’ . This means that the time-line, in the Mueller Report, lists some ‘events’ that did not happen, and some events that were not partisanly involved in the 2016 Presidential contest between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump."
NATO Chief Calls for Greater Military Spending and Buildup Against Russia,www.therussophile.org,Ashley Roberts,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/nato-chief-calls-for-greater-military-spending-and-buildup-against-russia.html/,"This post was originally published on this site

NATO chiefs are front men for Washington’s imperial agenda – notably at a time when the only threats to the West are invented ones. No real ones exist.
NATO operates as a virtual extension of Pentagon militarism and belligerence, a killing machine serving US interests, waging war on humanity.
Dominated by the US, supplying about 75% of its budget, the alliance represents the greatest threat to world peace, a notion it reviles.
For the first time since NATO’s 1949 establishment, its US-installed secretary general addressed a joint congressional session – symbolic of its support for global militarism and belligerence.
The overwhelming majority of its members support Washington’s permanent war agenda, an imperial scourge threatening everyone everywhere.
Jens Stoltenberg is current NATO chief, taking orders from Washington, saluting and obeying, reflected in his Wednesday remarks – notably hostile toward Russia.
NATO was never about adhering to UN Charter provisions, never about pursuing peace, nor about “safeguard(ing)” fundamental freedoms.
It’s against what democratic governance the way it should be is all about, along with “the rule of law” it flagrantly breaches time and again.
The US-dominated alliance threatens freedom-loving people everywhere. What Stoltenberg called its “(o)ne for all and all for one…promise” is all about advancing Washington’s imperium, all about war over peace, about destroying freedoms, not preserving them.
NATO supports the scourge of ISIS and likeminded terrorist groups, used as US imperial foot soldiers in Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Yemen, and elsewhere.
Alliance activities are unrelated to providing “European security and…freedom,” just the opposite. Stoltenberg lied claiming “NATO has been good for Europe,” adding:
It’s “been good for the United States.” Indeed by its member states partnering in US wars of aggression, serving its agenda at the expense of their own interests and welfare.
Stoltenberg’s address was all about promoting greater military spending when greatly reducing it is needed.
It was all about demonizing Russia more than already, nearly the entire Congress hostile to the country and its leadership.
Stoltenberg lied claiming NATO today “face(s) unprecedented challenges,” his laundry list topped by a nonexistent “assertive Russia.”
He lied accusing the Kremlin of “annex(ing) Crimea.” He lied saying for “(t)he first time in Europe…one country (took) part of another by force since World War II” – ignoring the Clinton co-presidency’s rape and dismemberment of Yugoslavia, turning truth on its head about Russia.
He lied accusing the Kremlin of “us(ing) a military-grade nerve agent in the United Kingdom.” Ignoring Obama regime-launched aggression in Syria, he disgracefully called Assad’s government a “murderous regime” – what applies to the US and its complicit NATO partners, not Damascus.
He lied about nonexistent “cyberattacks on NATO allies and partners, targeting everything from parliaments to power grids” – while ignoring Trump regime electricity war on Venezuela, sabotaging its power grid multiple times, along with waging illegal sanctions war and a whole lot more to eliminate its democratic government.
He lied about “(s)ophisticated disinformation campaigns (and) attempts to interfere in democracy” in Western nations where it’s nonexistent.
He lied claiming US-dominated NATO isn’t about “provok(ing) conflict,” falsely saying it’s to “prevent” them and “preserve the peace” the US and other key alliance members abhor.
He lied claiming NATO “strive(s) for a better relationship with Russia.” Dominated by hostile US actions, NATO’s mission is polar opposite his fabricated claim.
He falsely blamed Russia for hostile US actions, notably by Trump regime hardliners – abandoning the JCPOA Iran nuclear deal, INF Treaty, and waging endless wars inherited from their predecessors.
Stltenberg was silent about US-led NATO forces encroaching belligerently near Russia’s borders. Ignoring clear US INF Treaty breaches, he lied claiming Moscow “is in violation of the” treaty. Its military is in full compliance. No evidence suggests otherwise.
He lied saying “(w)e do not want a new arms race. We do not want a new Cold War.” Cold War 2.0 rages more menacingly than anything earlier, risking East/West confrontation, the ominous threat of unthinkable nuclear war.
“(W)e must…prepare for a world without the INF Treaty,” he roared, urging what he called “credible and effective deterrence” – notably by increased war spending when stepping back from the brink is essential.
Stolenberg ignored endless US wars of aggression in Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Yemen, Somalia, and aggression by other means against Iran, Venezuela and elsewhere – along with partnering in Israeli wars and other brutality against defenseless Palestinians.
He turned truth on its head claiming “NATO fully supports the peace process” – nonexistent in Occupied Palestine, Afghanistan, Syria and elsewhere because the US rejects conflict resolution everywhere.
He lied claiming NATO is “part of a global coalition to defeat ISIS” – the scourge it supports while pretending otherwise.
“NATO allies must spend more on “defense,” he roared – code language for promoting endless militarism and belligerence, maintaining the fiction of foreign threats.
World stability and security require less for so-called “defense,” much more for vital homeland needs in all member states, mainly increased infrastructure and social spending, especially for healthcare and education.
As long as NATO exists and expands, aiming to become a global force, world peace, stability and security will remain unattainable.
The threat of nuclear war will remain an ominous threat, the ultimate doomsday scenario if launched by accident or design."

MOSCOW, April 5. /TASS/. Hyundai is among some firms that seek to snap up Ford automobile plants slated for closure in Russia and within a month or two the fate of these facilities will have to be decided on, Minister of Industry and Trade Denis Manturov told reporters on Friday.
“The issue probably requires further consideration. Let’s give it time, so as not to overshadow future events. I believe, our colleagues will decide within a month or two,” the minister said.
“Among others,” Manturov said, responding to a question on whether Hyundai is among the companies eyeing these automobile plants.
It was reported in late March that Ford would halt automobile production in Russia by the end of June. Two automobile plants in Vsevolozhsk and Naberezhnye Chelny, as well as the engine plant in Alabuga in Tatarstan will be closed. Ford and Sollers would set up a renewed joint venture based on the latter’s facility, in which Sollers will gain a 51% stake. The JV will produce and sell Ford Transit vehicles.

Russia files 257 neutral-status applications with IAAF for national athletes,www.therussophile.org,Michael Sullivan,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/russia-files-257-neutral-status-applications-with-iaaf-for-national-athletes.html/,"This post was originally published on this site
MOSCOW, April 5. /TASS/. The All-Russia Athletics Federation (RusAF) has received 270 applications from national athletes requesting to grant them a neutral status, of which 257 have been sent to the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF), RusAF spokeswoman Natalia Yukhareva told TASS on Friday.
The IAAF Doping Review Board approved on December 18, 2018 an updated version of the Guidance Note for Authorized Neutral Athlete (ANA) status applications and sent the document to the RusAF.
The RusAF started accepting neutral status applications from national track and field athletes on December 19. The world’s governing athletics body has already granted neutral-status participation permits to 67 Russian track and field athletes.
“As of April 5 morning, we [RusAF] have received a total of 270 applications from national athletes and 257 of them were forwarded to IAAF,” Yukhareva said.
According to the IAAF regulations, the global athletics body has the right to disregard individual applications unaccompanied by an official document from the RusAF with all the necessary information, which the federation has in regard to a particular applicant. The document must also state whether the RusAF confirms that an applicant is in compliance with all requirements and whether it grants its own approval.
The IAAF suspended RusAF’s membership in late 2015 following a wave of anti-doping rules violations and put forward a host of criteria, which the Russian ruling body of track and field sports was obliged to implement in order to restore its membership in the global federation.
The IAAF, however, permitted clean athletes from Russia to participate in the international tournaments under the neutral status or the Authorized Neutral Athlete (ANA) until the membership of the RusAF was reinstated. IAAF’s previously issued neutral-status permissions for Russian athletes expired on December 31, 2018.
In late December, the IAAF reported that in 2018 the world’s athletics body received more than 200 applications from Russian athletes. A total of 73 Russian athletes were declared eligible to compete as authorized neutral athletes in 2018. Sixty eight applications were denied and six athletes had their ANA status revoked. A number of further applications have been withdrawn or were submitted out of time.

TALLINN, April 4. /TASS/. The upcoming meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid is very important for the bilateral relations between the two countries, the Estonian leader said on Thursday.
“The meeting is a signal,” she said in an interview with the ATV+ channel. “Look, the Estonian diplomats and politicians talk about Russia on the global stage, but it is hard to understand, really, why they are not talking to Russia. Knowing that we have so few points of convergence, it is important to hold this meeting in itself.”
She added that during the meeting, they may discuss a wide set of bilateral and international issues.
“We are always talking about Ukraine, about Georgia,” the Estonian leader noted. “We are trying to understand the ways of implementing the Minsk agreements. We will discuss the bilateral relations, because we should not forget that Estonia and Russia do have them, after all. We have border cooperation and cultural cooperation. The next EU budget period is ahead of us, and I hope that the EU will maintain the joint Estonian-Russian program [for border cooperation]. Two neighbors always have topics for discussion.”
On Wednesday, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov informed reporters that Putin plans to meet with Kaljulaid on April 18. The Estonian leader will be visiting Moscow in order to participate in the inauguration ceremony of the country’s embassy after the renovation works have been completed.

MOSCOW, April 5. /TASS/. Russian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov sees nothing unusual in people’s wish to seek their fortunes elsewhere, so the Gallup poll’s finding one in five Russians would like to leave the country is not a very high rate. The number of those who would like to emigrate from the United States is larger, he remarked.
“Such surveys are held by different pollsters in different countries around the world. The rate we’ve seen is not the highest by all means,” he said about the Gallup statistics. “The number of Americans who would like to emigrate from the United States is higher than one-fifth.”
“It’s a normal process by and large. Some people are more migration-minded than others. This is a usual theme for sociological research,” Peskov said, adding that such statistics should be regarded with certain allowances for the likely margins of error.
Earlier, a Gallup poll said that a record-high number of Russians would like to leave the country. According to its latest poll up to 20% Russians (a record-high rate since 2007) said they would like to resettle elsewhere.

MOSCOW, April 5. /TASS/. Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan will meet on April 8 to discuss the situation in Syria, including in the context of the US plans to partially pull out its forces from that country, Kremlin Aide Yuri Ushakov said on Friday.
The Russian and Turkish presidents will also discuss the deliveries of S-400 air defense systems to Turkey, the pace of building the Turkish Stream gas pipeline and the Akkuyu nuclear power plant, the Kremlin aide said.
“The sides will discuss international issues, from which I would single out the situation in Syria,” Ushakov said.
“The talks will also focus on the US plans announced in the context of the partial pullout of American forces from Syria, and also other issues, including of regional nature,” he said.
As the Kremlin aide said, the Russian and Turkish leaders will also discuss the deliveries of S-400 air defense systems to Turkey. “The next issue is the implementation of a high-profile project, the contract on the deliveries of Russia’s most advanced S-400 systems to the Turkish armed forces. The presidents will discuss this theme as well.”
Putin and Erdogan will hold full-format negotiations at their meeting in Moscow on April 8, including a session of the Russia-Turkey High-Level Cooperation Council. The talks will begin in a narrow format and “it is not ruled out that some part of this talk will be held tete-a-tete, which will be done to discuss the most sensitive issues,” the Kremlin aide said.
After that, the leaders of both countries will participate in a plenary session of the Cooperation Council, which will be followed by their roundtable discussion with representatives of business, Ushakov said.
The sides are also planning to sign some joint documents, the work on which is currently underway. After the business talks are over, the two presidents will hold a joint news conference. In the evening of April 8, Putin and Erdogan will take part in the ceremony of opening the Cross Year of Culture and Tourism of Russia and Turkey that will be held in the Bolshoi Theater.

"Global Stocks Rise On, What Else, “Trade Talk Optimism”",www.therussophile.org,Tyler Durden,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/global-stocks-rise-on-what-else-trade-talk-optimism.html/,"This post was originally published on this site
Another day, another round of “US-China trade talk optimism.”
Global stocks continued their drift higher to close the week, with the MSCI World Index on track for a second straight week of gains while emerging-market stocks extended their winning streak to seven days, the longest stretch in more than a year, as both China and the U.S. claimed progress in trade talks.
“Buy algos” were encouraged after both China and the US claimed progress in talks to end their trade war, with President Xi Jinping pushing for a rapid conclusion and President Donald Trump talking up prospects for a “monumental” agreement that might be announced within four weeks, although he warned that it would be difficult to allow trade to continue without an agreement. Benchmark bond yields ground higher and the dollar reached a three-week high against the yen before U.S. job data. Better-than expected industrial output data out of Germany and receding fears of a disorderly Brexit also helped perk up sentiment.
While Chinese markets were closed, US equity-index futures advanced alongside Asian stocks, European bourses and Chinese stock futures after a Xinhua report that President Xi Jinping said substantial progress had been made on the text for a trade deal. “The main overnight news, which is positive if not very substantial, is around the U.S.-China trade deal,” said Mizuho strategist Antoine Bouvet. “German industrial orders yesterday added to worries in the manufacturing sector, but industrial production today actually surprised to the upside.”
“There’s a little bit of a risk that it’s a sell-on-the-news event,” Ann Miletti, a fund manager at Wells Fargo Asset Management, said of U.S.-China trade talks. “ The devil is really in the details – how good is this deal going to look?”
Europe’s Stoxx 600 traded sideways, shrugging off trade optimism and Brexit news ahead of today’s U.S. payrolls. Eurostoxx 50 is little changed, Markets in Paris and London added 0.1%. German stocks were treading water, with modest gains in basic resources and autos sectors offset by weakness in real estate and telecoms, though the index was on track for its best week since December 2016. German industrial output rose by 0% percent in February, better than the 0.5% expected, as mild weather helped a surge in construction activity. But manufacturing production dipped as Germany continues to suffer from trade friction with China and Brexit angst after narrowly avoiding recession last year. Leading economic institutes slashed their forecasts for 2019 growth on Thursday and warned a long-term upswing had come to an end.
Earlier in the session, trading volumes throughout Asia were muted, with cash markets in China and Hong Kong shut for a holiday.
S&P futures pointed to modest gains for stocks on Friday, with S&P 500 edging up 0.16% to 2,887, only 1.75% away from its Sept 2019 closing high, which is prompting some caution: “Share markets have run hard and fast from their December lows and are vulnerable to a short-term pullback,” said Shane Oliver, head of investment strategy at AMP Capital. “But valuations are okay, global growth is expected to improve into the second half of the year, monetary and fiscal policy has become more supportive of markets and the trade war threat is receding.”
Attention now turns to the March payrolls report, which is forecast to rebound to 177,000 in March, following February’s surprisingly low 20,000 rise. As Jim Reid writes overnight, “how markets fare today will likely be dictated by the March employment report.”
A reminder that last month we had that huge plunge in payroll growth to just +20k which was the lowest since September 2017 and the third lowest since January 2011. Expectations are for a bounce back 177k print however that is still below the average of the last three (186k), six (190k) and twelve (212k) months. To be fair there is a decent range on the Bloomberg survey at 110k to 277k. Our US economists have a 165k forecast and they note that the hostile weather in mid-March also raises the risk of another downside miss. As for earnings, the consensus is for a solid +0.3% mom reading (DB at +0.2% mom) which should keep the annual rate at +3.4% yoy. The unemployment rate is also expected to hold steady at 3.8%. So lots to look out for as ever.
In focus will be hourly earnings, which climbed to 3.4% in February, the fastest pace since April 2009. Hopes for a solid number were boosted by data on jobless claims, which fell to a 50-year low last week. With traders betting that the next Fed move will be to lower interest rates, not raise them, the fixed-income market could be affected by any signs of wage strength in today’s report.
In other overnight news, President Trump commented that there would be a 25% tariff on car imports from Mexico if he decides to apply tariffs but also said that Mexico has done good regarding the border during past 4 days, while he added that he did not say the border would stay open for a year but that he would place tariffs first. Trump also confirmed he has recommended Herman Cain to the Fed board.
In the latest Brexit news, UK PM May sent a letter to EU’s Tusk proposing an extension for Brexit until 30th June 2019 with potential to terminate early should a deal be ratified before then. Letter states that the UK will begin to prepare to host European elections and that the UK needs to provide a clear plan by Tuesday (the day before the EU Council meeting). Separately, there were reports EU’s Tusk is preparing to offer the UK a 12-month flexible extension, according to a senior EU source; which has since been confirmd by a Senior EU Official. EU Council President Tusk’s proposal of a year long extension to Brexit would permit the UK to leave as early as 1st July if the UK has passed with Withdrawal Agreement by that point, according to a senior EU official.
The optimistic mood again weighed on safe-haven debt, with government bond yields in Europe and the United States rising in early trade. 10 Year US and German bond yields climbed to a two-week high, the latter just above zero , the former rising to 2.535%.
In currencies, the progress on trade was enough to keep the safe-haven yen under pressure and lift the dollar to a three-week high of 111.79. The dollar steadied before the release of U.S. payrolls data, while sterling initially advanced after the U.K. asked the EU to kick the Brexit can down the road once again, only to sink below Thursday lows after.
An index of developing-nation currencies was little changed, with Indonesia’s rupiah leading gains versus the dollar along with South Africa’s rand and Mexico’s peso. President Xi Jinping reportedly said substantial progress had been made on the text for a trade deal, raising hopes of a swift end to the dispute that has weighed on the global economy
In commodities, Brent crude futures were off 23 cents at $69.17 after touching $70 a barrel for the first time since November, as expectations of tight global supply outweighed rising U.S. production. WTI priced at $62.16 a barrel. Spot gold dipped to $1,291.61 per ounce but held above a near 10-week low hit overnight.

Top Overnight News Through a message passed to U.S. President Donald Trump via Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, President Xi called for an early conclusion to trade negotiations, the official Xinhua News Agency said. Liu, who took part in talks this week in Washington, said the two sides had “reached new consensus on such important issues as the text” of a trade agreement, according to Xinhua A potential U.S.- China trade agreement could face challenges from other World Trade Organization members depending on the details and whether other nations feel it unfairly hurts them, the group’s chief said. May’s request for another Brexit postponement sets up a battle with the EU ahead of a key summit next week.

Asian equity markets traded slightly mixed following a similar indecisive lead from Wall St . as US-China trade optimism was partially offset by pre-NFP caution and holiday thinned conditions from closures across the Greater China region. ASX 200 (-0.8%) was the laggard and extended on its pullback from 7-month highs, with the declines led by tech which mirrored the underperformance of the sector stateside. Nikkei 225 (+0.4%) was positive with the index underpinned by favourable currency moves and trade-related hopes, while the KOSPI (+0.1%) remained afloat as index giant Samsung Electronics weathered a miss on its Q1 earnings guidance. Chinese markets were shut for national holidays although there was certainly no lack of relevant news flow with trade talks remaining in the limelight, in which leaders from both sides noted substantial progress was made and President Trump suggested that a deal could be announced in the next 4 weeks. Finally, 10yr JGBs were pressured amid spill-over selling from T-notes and as stocks in Japan remained afloat, while the BoJ were only present in the market today for T-bills. US President Trump said rapid progress is being made in trade discussions with China and we’re getting very close to trade deal, but added it is not yet made and could be announced in the next 4 weeks, maybe more or less. Furthermore, US President Trump said he will hold a summit with Chinese President XI in Washington if there is a deal and that he will discuss tariffs with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, while he cited tariffs as well as IP theft when asked about sticking points.

WTI rests just above its 200 DMA at 61.38, whilst its global counterpart straddles just below its 200 DMA at 69.54. Oil is on track for its longest weekly winning streak since the back-end of 2017, overall supported by the output decline in Venezuela coupled with growing hope of a US-Sino trade truce. Crude has advanced around 40% this year thus far as OPEC+ supply curbs counter record high US shale production. As a reminder, tonight will see the release of the Baker Hughes rig count, although price-action may be muted amidst macro-newsflow. Not much price action in the metals complex (thus far) with gold (U/C) treading water around yesterday’s close after briefly breaching its 200 DMA (1283) to the downside yesterday, whilst copper (-0.1%) remains tentative amidst the cautious risk-tone. Finally, Australia’s Port Hedland’s iron ore shipments to China declined by 8% M/M, totalling 30.7mln tonnes vs. 33.5mln tonnes in February after the port was shut for almost 4 days due to cyclones hitting Western Australia.

DB’s Jim Reid concludes the overnight wrap
Good morning from Munich, one of my favourite cities in Europe and not just because Liverpool beat them in the Champions League last month. It always brings back memories when I pass the Bayerischer Hof in Munich as when I was staying there in 2002 on a work trip unbeknown to me Liam Gallagher of Oasis was also there at the same time and evidently required some major dental work after a fracas in the hotel nightclub. It was all over the newspapers on my return. Fortunately I was long tucked up in bed when it happened.
Markets were certainly waiting for something to get their teeth stuck into for most of yesterday as everyone awaited the news of the Trump-China VP Liu He meeting and also held fire ahead of today’s payrolls. The former ended after the US markets closed last night. The officials announced no major breakthrough on trade talks but the direction of travel seems to continue to be positive. Trump did float a potential timeline: four more weeks of talks, then two weeks to schedule and attend a summit with President Xi. He said that IP protections, certain tariffs, and enforcement are all still being negotiated. In the meantime, Chinese President Xi Jinping said that substantial progress has been made in trade talks with the US and called for an early conclusion of the US-China trade text.
Equity markets in the US were already shut by the time those headlines hit however sentiment overnight in Asia is slightly on the positive side with the Nikkei (+0.41%) up and Kospi (+0.04%) flatish. Markets in China and Hong Kong are closed for a holiday. Elsewhere futures on the S&P 500 are up +0.15% and 2y and 10y treasury yields are up c. 1bps this morning.
How markets fare today will likely be dictated by the March employment report in the US this afternoon. A reminder that last month we had that huge plunge in payroll growth to just +20k which was the lowest since September 2017 and the third lowest since January 2011. Expectations are for a bounce back 177k print however that is still below the average of the last three (186k), six (190k) and twelve (212k) months. To be fair there is a decent range on the Bloomberg survey at 110k to 277k. Our US economists have a 165k forecast and they note that the hostile weather in mid-March also raises the risk of another downside miss. As for earnings, the consensus is for a solid +0.3% mom reading (DB at +0.2% mom) which should keep the annual rate at +3.4% yoy. The unemployment rate is also expected to hold steady at 3.8%. So lots to look out for as ever.
Back to yesterday and it wasn’t an overly exciting day in markets with the S&P 500 (+0.21%) advancing a bit as gains for energy and materials were offset by losses for utilities and tech. The index has traded in a tight 0.93% range over the last three sessions, its second tightest of the year. The NASDAQ closed -0.05% to leave the winning run behind at five days with Tesla (-8.23%) doing some of the damage, however the DOW (+0.64%) did outperform helped by gains for Boeing (+2.89%). In Europe the STOXX 600 (-0.27%) faded to a small loss. WTI oil remained tame (-0.58%), capping its narrowest three-day trading range since last September. The moderate risk off lifted bonds with 10y Treasuries down -1.1bps and Bunds (-0.6bps) back into negative territory again. At my Munich dinner last night of 10-15 clients, I asked who thought Germany should take advantage of ultra low yields and borrow 50yr or 100yr money and invest it in their economy. Everyone raised their hands. I thought there would be a more conservative balanced response and was therefore pleasantly surprised.
Elsewhere the USD (+0.20%) was firmer which weighed on some EM currencies. The Turkish lira outperformed, advancing +0.64% (down -0.48% this morning) after Bloomberg reported that the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development as well as the World Bank’s International Finance Corporation are looking at increasing their Turkish NPL portfolios. It wasn’t clear if this was a policy change or just consistent with their standard operating procedure, but the currency rallied sharply on the headlines.
The fact that it’s taken this many paragraphs to get to Brexit suggests that there’s been a dip in the newsflow. Indeed, perhaps fitting of the current state of affairs in Parliament, the most entertaining story was a water leak forcing a debate on tax legislation in the Commons to be suspended yesterday. So a rare chance for MPs to discuss a non-Brexit topic was scuppered by rusty pipes. The only notable Brexit news was the suggestion that any more votes on Brexit proposals might not take place before PM May travels to Brussels next week. That raises the risks that Mrs May goes to Brussels next Wednesday and asks for an extension with no firm plan. That will increase the risks of a hard Brexit a week from today. I still think that’s unlikely but it will put the EU in a difficult position if no progress has been made. Talks between May and Corbyn are ongoing with Tories saying they were “productive” whereas Labour didn’t offer up any descriptive word about them. One gets the sense that both sides realise they have a lot to lose by agreeing a grand bargain however both BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg and ITV’s Robert Peston tweeted last night that their sources suggested the talks are credible and could result in something. It’s possible we’ll learn more this afternoon. Sterling closed -0.62% yesterday as the stakes were raised.
In other news, it’s worth flagging another ECB deposit tiering story yesterday, this time from the FT. The article suggested that the arguments in favour of tiering are building within the ECB camp. The story made the point that the key argument is the increasing likelihood of rates remaining at current low levels for an extended period of time. As such, tiering could be part of a package in which the ECB adjusts its forward guidance to endorse market pricing, which is no hikes until at least later in 2020.
Speaking of the ECB and tiering, the minutes from the March meeting which were out yesterday didn’t offer much in the way of new hints. The text revealed that “concerns were voiced that over time the effects of persistently low rates could depress banks’ interest margins and profitability with negative effects on bank intermediation and financial stability in the longer run. It was recalled that the consequences of low rates differed across the maturity spectrum and across banks, depending on their business models and the structure of their assets and liabilities”. Crucially, there was no direct reference to tiering.
As a final point on Europe, there were a couple of GDP downgrade headlines which hit the screens early yesterday. The first was Germany where “institutes” revised down their 2019 growth forecast to 0.8% from 1.9%. However it turned out that the 1.9% was from back in September so it wasn’t all that surprising given the six months of slowing data since then, and compares to the IFO forecast at 0.6%. Shortly after, Bloomberg reported that the Italian Treasury is set to slash its 2019 growth forecast to 0.1% from a 1.0% forecast previously. Again though, this is closer to where the market is. So both headlines were really more noise than anything else.
Turning quickly to yesterday’s Fedspeak, where the overall message was consistent with the existing policy stance. NY Fed President Williams said that “policy is in the right place” and that growth should slow to around 2% this year. Separately, two of the more hawkish committee members, Cleveland’s Mester and Philadelphia’s Harker, maintained their positions for a pause in policy for now, with Mester arguing for “no urgency to change our policy stance” and Harker saying “I continue to be in wait-and-see mode.” They both left the door open for future hikes though. Mester said if the economy evolves as she expects, then “rates may need to move a bit higher” and Harker said “my outlook for rates remains, at most, one hike for 2019 and one for 2020.” Finally, Bloomberg reported that President Trump plans to nominate former presidential candidate Herman Cain for one of the vacant Fed Governorships. He would need to be confirmed by the senate.
Wrapping up the few data prints that were out yesterday. In the US claims continued their trend of reversing the Q4 spike, dropping 10k to 202k (vs. 215k expected) and in fact to a new 49-year low. The four-week moving average is now down to 214k and the lowest since October. Prior to this, we had another disappointing factory orders print in Germany where orders fell -4.2% mom versus expectations for a +0.3% mom lift.
Finally to the day ahead now, where this morning we’ve got more data out of Germany with the February industrial production print, followed by the February trade balance print and March house price data and Q4 labour costs data in the UK. The aforementioned March employment report in the US is the highlight today while late this evening we’ll get the February consumer credit print for the US. Away from that, the Fed’s Bostic speaks this evening while the big US banks will today submit their capital plans with stress test results announced in June.

I want to offer you something different than the barrage of facts and figures around nuclear weapons. But let’s establish the basics. There are nine countries that possess them: France, China, the United Kingdom, India, Pakistan, Israel, North Korea and — of course — Russia and the United States. Together these nine countries possess a total of 14,575 nuclear weapons, with the United States and Russia accounting for 92 percent of them.
Then there’s the outlandish nuclear weapons budgets and U.S. plans to modernize and upgrade current nuclear weapons stockpiles at egregious expense. According to a new government estimate , plans for modernizing and maintaining the nuclear arsenal will cost $494 billion over the next decade — an average of just under $50 billion per year.
All of this is happening with Donald Trump in the White House. With his recklessness and overriding need to win — or appear to win — at all costs, he is more dangerous than his predecessors. And that’s despite the fact that every president of the nuclear age played a part in extending the nuclear nightmare and increasing the threat of global annihilation.
Again, these are just the basics — things you already knew or aren’t terribly surprised to learn. That’s why I want to tell you a different story about nuclear weapons: My own.
It comes through the lens of the nuclear fire and my relationships to the people who serve as a sort of bucket-brigade — offering sense, responsibility and sacrifice in an effort to douse the inferno.
April 1, 1974
I am born. It’s a home birth to a nun and a priest — in the basement of a tall three-story row house full of anti-nuclear activists. On the day of my birth, the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists ’ Doomsday Clock stands at 12 minutes to nuclear midnight, moved back from 10 minutes in 1972 after the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks between the United States and Soviet Union developed a road map for reducing nuclear arsenals.
A few months after I am born, the scientists move the clock forward again — this time to 9 minutes to nuclear midnight , “In recognition that our hopes for an awakening of sanity were premature and that the danger of nuclear doomsday is measurably greater today than it was in 1972.”
Richard Nixon is president. He’s a nuclear hothead who perfects the “madman” strategy of nuclear diplomacy. He tells a meeting of congressmen, “I can go in my office and pick up a telephone, and in 25 minutes, millions of people will be dead.”
I am blissfully unaware. A healthy baby — the first of three — born to parents, Elizabeth McAllister and Philip Berrigan, who had set themselves on a course that maybe should have precluded children: a course of robust, muscular, creative, risky anti-nuclear resistance.
My uncle, Daniel Berrigan, the Jesuit priest and poet, writes a series of poems to welcome me into the world. One goes like this:
You came from Harrisburg pit You came from Custom’s House blood You came from Catonsville Fire You came from jail You came in spite of Judge Mace’s death’s head Shaking “no” in its socket. You came without regard to writs, torts, barbed wire You came up from the least known Phiz, China and beyond Down from Dante’s crystalline Paradise– a round eyed You came from a nun You came from a priest You came from a vow Yes and No and the Great Tao That creeps. A vine The world’s rack for its own dismembering and flowering.
March 28, 1979
Three days before my fifth birthday, the Three Mile Island Nuclear Power Plant suffers a partial meltdown. It is decades before I learn what that term really means, but the terror is real. Three Mile Island is less than 90 miles from our house and radiation is headed our way. My parents take my little brother and I to West Virginia — as far away as they could figure — for the better part of two weeks.
We return to a changed diet: miso in hot water for breakfast every morning. My mother read that healthcare workers in Hiroshima drank the fermented soybean paste in water after the U.S. atomic bombing in 1945. They strengthened their immune systems and cleansed radiation out of their bodies with this ancient traditional Japanese food.
Miso is brown, salty and is disgusting to the 5-year-old palate. But we drink it every morning for years.
My parents start to look more deeply at the connections between nuclear weapons and nuclear power. There are nearly 100 nuclear power reactors across the United States, and they provide roughly one-fifth of the electricity produced in the country. Nuclear power is one of the dirtiest, most dangerous and most expensive sources of energy. Nuclear reactors in the United States and around the globe are plagued by accidents, leaks, extended outages, delayed construction and skyrocketing costs. Nuclear reactors produce highly radioactive waste that continues to threaten the environment and public health for thousands of years and for which no safe disposal exists.
There is a large scale movement to end the production of nuclear weapons and our dependence on nuclear power as well. Our father shouts at us every time we leave a light on: “Okay, now we are supporting Calvert Cliffs — our local nuclear power plant.”
September 9, 1980
I am 6 years old and my brother is 5 when our father and seven others gain access to General Electric’s Nuclear Missile Reentry Division plant in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania.
A few months earlier the Doomsday Clock had been moved from 9 to 7 minutes to nuclear midnight because the United States and Soviet Union are behaving like “nucleoholics — drunks who continue to insist that the drink being consumed is positively ‘the last one,’ but who can always find a good excuse for ‘just one more round.’”
Our dad and his friends hammer on two nose cones, pour blood and read from this statement:
We commit civil disobedience at General Electric because this genocidal entity is the fifth leading producer of weaponry in the United States. To maintain this position, GE drains $3 million a day from the public treasury, an enormous larceny against the poor. We wish also to challenge the lethal lie spun by GE through its motto, ‘we bring good things to life.’ As manufacturers of the Mark 12A reentry vehicle, GE actually prepares to bring good things to death. Through the Mark 12A, the threat of first strike nuclear war grows more imminent. This GE advances the possible destruction of millions of innocent lives.
This is a new kind of action, in the tradition of the Catonsville Nine (which two of the eight participated in) and the Hebrew prophets who enjoined peacemakers to beat swords into plowshares.
Our dad writes:
We love our children and all children — that is why we are in resistance; that is why we are in jail. We cannot abandon the children; cannot render them to caesar for our immunity and comfort. And that love for them, and for the God who blessed us with them, will enrich their lives. So runs our hope.
Fall 1980 finds us in school for the first time, at sea in a swirl of six-year-old politics that we do not understand. We are objects of fascination and derision to our mostly African-American classmates and regarded with pity by most of our teachers. They have been told what our father has done and — even though they know the details of the action and that he is a good person — they have less context for what he has done than we do.
Our father spends that Christmas in jail. Just before the holiday, we go and visit him and my brother Jerry says: “We want to thank you, Dad. You’ve given us the greatest Christmas gift anyone could.”
“What’s that, Jer?” our Dad asks. There were no presents from the Montgomery County Jail in rural Pennsylvania.
“Your action. You were making peace, just as Jesus was in coming to us at Christmas.”
This becomes an oft-told story in our household, used at various times to celebrate my brother’s thoughtfulness and sincerity or, at other times, to highlight our long downward spiral since that glorious apex of insight and righteousness.
Our dad faces years in jail. In a February 1981 jury trial, he is convicted of burglary, conspiracy and criminal mischief and sentenced to 5-10 years in jail. It isn’t until April 1990 (when I am 16) that the Plowshares 8 wins some overturning of charges on a hard fought (and almost forgotten) appeal.
Somewhere between action, trial and conviction, my sister Kate is conceived. My mom comes home from the doctor’s appointment — after finding out she was pregnant — and slugs a shot of scotch.
Liz McAlister turns 42 just two weeks after my sister is born on Nov. 5, 1981. The Doomsday Clock is at 4 minutes to nuclear midnight, moved in January in response to “the flat unwillingness of either the United States or the Soviet Union to reject publicly, and in all circumstances, the threat of striking the other first. Both sides willfully delude themselves that a nuclear war can remain limited or even be won. In 1980 both sides officially declared nuclear war ‘thinkable.’”
November 20, 1983
I am 9 and my brother is 8. Our sister has just turned 2. As a general rule, we are not permitted to watch television, except for the nightly news. But on this random Sunday before Thanksgiving, we Berrigan children get a special treat. We watch a television movie with our parents. It is called “ The Day After .”
More than 35 years later, before consulting Google, the details of the film were vague, but the outline is clear. The film imagines a nuclear attack on the United States and the lives of the people who survive its aftermath.
After the film, we sat with our parents while our mom told us that she was going to do an action soon that would try and keep what the film depicted from happening.
She later wrote about that conversation:
Our children have grown up with these [nuclear] realities as part of the air they breathe. They have seen many people in the community in which we live, including their mom and dad, imprisoned for resistance to nuclear annihilation. But to have mom do something like this and to face her possible absence from their day to day lives for an indefinite amount of time — this was a large step.
They were willing to accept the personal sacrifice of my absence as their part in trying to stop nuclear war from happening, as their part in trying to avoid the suffering that the movie displayed… They committed themselves to assuming more responsibility around the house, especially to be helpful dealing with the questions and fears of their little sister, who was not able to understand it as they were.
It was a moment of extreme closeness for the four of us — a moment of accepting together whatever might come, and we concluded our conversation with prayer and big big hugs.
Thirty-five years later, reconsidering this story as a parent myself, it strikes me as a very calculated move: a mom power play. But there we were.
President Ronald Reagan watched the film a few weeks before it hit TV screens and wrote in his diary that the film was “very effective and left me greatly depressed.” Nearly 100 million people watched “The Day After” on its first broadcast, a record audience for a made-for-TV movie. But very few followed it up with an action like our mom’s.
November 24, 1983
Mom is one of seven who enter the Griffiss Air Force Base in upstate New York in the early hours of the morning to hammer and pour blood on a B-52 Bomber.
We are in Syracuse with my dad’s brother and his family when it happens. It takes hours for the base security to learn of the breach and arrest them. They are initially charged with sabotage, conspiracy and destruction of government property — and face 25 years in jail. We are, as I said, 9, 8 and 2.
They are eventually tried in a federal court in Syracuse. Their trial is a strange mix of freedom and scrutiny for my brother, sister and me. Our mom and dad are caught up in the trial, and we are left to play and grapple largely unsupervised. But we are also in the media eye. People magazine calls us “troupers to the extreme” when it covered mom’s sentencing in July 1984.
Our dad tells the reporter, “They don’t cry. They’ve been raised in a resistance community, and they’ve seen their mother and father repeatedly brought to jail for nonviolent civil disobedience.”
We did cry. Our mom serves 26 months in Alderson Federal prison in West Virginia. We fall into a rhythm of traveling there once a month for a long weekend. The powers that be conspire to make those weekends fall on every school field trip or fun excursion planned by our teachers. Our dad writes us long “please excuse my children from school” letters reminding our teachers every month that our mom is in jail for her anti-nuclear action. He sees it as an opportunity for education. We bypass this impulse and figure out a way to relate exclusively with the school secretary for early dismissals on these fraught Fridays. We are not the only kids with moms in jail, but we are the only ones whose dad writes polemics about it every month. We endure.
April 3, 1988
It’s Easter Sunday. I am 14, and it is two days after my birthday. My dad is one of four activists who board the battleship Iowa in Norfolk, Virginia as part of a public tour greeting the vessel on its return from service in the Persian Gulf. The four disarmed two armored box launchers for the Tomahawk Cruise Missile, hammering and pouring blood, and unfurled two banners: “Seek the Disarmed Christ” and “Tomahawks Into Plowshares.” It becomes known as the Nuclear Navy Plowshares action.
My dad is sentenced to six months in prison.
March 31, 1991
Another Easter Sunday. The day before I am to turn 17, and this time my father is in Bath, Maine, aboard the U.S.S. Gettysburg, taking part in the Aegis Plowshares action. The state declines to prosecute and charges are dismissed the day before the trial was scheduled to start.
December 7, 1993
While not close to any birthdays or special holidays, it is the anniversary of Pearl Harbor Day. I am 19, in my second year at Hampshire College . The activists wade through marshes and over rough terrain to gain access to the tarmac at Seymour Johnson Air Force base in Goldsboro, North Carolina. There they hammer on an F-15 fighter plane before being surrounded by hundreds of armed soldiers who were engaged in war game exercises at the time. They call themselves the Pax Christi-Spirit of Life Plowshares.
The trial the next February was notable to some people because the judge enforced a gag order and refused any mention of the political or moral justification for their actions. It was notable to me because my college boyfriend was able to attend. I was trying to integrate the various pieces of my life and not just slip the letter to the school secretary any more.
Visiting him at the county jail in the midst of the trial, my dad says, “Was that Him in the courtroom?” I nod, nervous and proud at the same time. “Seems a bit of a hippie, doesn’t he?” my dad observes. And that was that.
February 12, 1997
My dad is one of 6 who boards the U.S.S. Sullivans, a nuclear-capable Aegis destroyer at Bath Iron Works in Maine. They hammer and pour blood on different parts of the battleship. As they read their action statement and unfurl a banner, armed military security forcibly push them to the deck and place them under arrest.
They call themselves the Prince of Peace Plowshares, and they are tried in May and sentenced in October. My dad is sentenced to two years in jail and told not to associate with any other felons except for his wife. He pays this no mind. He is 74 years old at the time.
I had finished college the month before and moved home. In that brief time before his action, we spent our time building a composting toilet to collect our “ humanure .” I help him out on less controversial projects around the house, while looking for a job. He doesn’t understand why I want a job.
“I have student loans, Dad.”
He is flabbergasted. His daughter is in debt?
“Yep, I owe $14,000 bucks, Dad.”
I went to the most expensive college in the country (with a great financial aid package) and nobody had any money to put down at the beginning.
I managed to get into college with encouragement from people outside of my nuclear family. Mom and Dad were not much help. It was hard to explain — to a man who went to college on the G.I. Bill after World War II and then graduated school as a Josephite priest — the real cost of a college education.
Awaiting trial after the action, Dad is in a county jail in Maine. Every time I go visit him, I upset the routine of local activists who visit him every week, and I feel awkward as they give me “private” time with my dad, grizzled and rumpled in his orange suit.
I walk with my class at Hampshire College in May 1997 on a frigid day. We go straight from the graduation ceremony up to Maine to see Dad in jail. My brother graduates a few weeks later. Our sister graduates from high school the next year. He misses it all.
I recently poured through my high school and college journals — thick, precious times that show how much time I had to process my experiences before social media or small children. I looked for hard evidence of the bereavement I tend to lay atop my parents’ absences. But it wasn’t there, or it was so between-the-lines that my 44-year-old eyes couldn’t see it.
Nowhere did I write: “I am distraught because my father is missing my graduation.”
Looking back now, forced to confront the patina of angst I’ve spread over all these memories, it occurs to me that we were deeply embedded in this life. It was who we were and what we did. We did not question it. And while we missed our dad (mostly) and our mom (earlier), we included them in everything. We recounted it all in letters and visits. We saved the best parts for them. In some sense, our experiences weren’t entirely real until we shared them with our dad or mom (whoever wasn’t physically there).
December 19, 1999
The group cuts through a fence at the Air National Guard Base in Essex, Maryland and pours blood, hangs a rosary and a banner, and hammers on two A-10 Warthog bombers. All were charged with malicious destruction of property and conspiracy. They call the action “Plowshares vs. Depleted Uranium.”
By this point, I am living in New York City. I have an apartment in Brooklyn and a boyfriend who is not a hippy. In fact, he has gained my dad’s grudging regard. I also have a job at the New School for Social Research, where I work for an arms analyst and public intellectual named William Hartung . At college, my friends and I had joked about becoming public intellectuals like Edward Said or Eqbal Ahmed, and now here I am earning money to pay attention to the military industrial complex. I feel incredibly lucky and very uncomfortable with my good fortune.
I know all about depleted uranium — the radioactive byproduct that is used as a covering on munitions to give them armor-busting capabilities. Some of my favorite times with my dad are trading bad news story for bad news story. He is reading (and enjoying) the many articles I am writing and publishing. He occasionally enjoins me to not have such a secular voice and to end my articles for In These Times or The Progressive with a Jesus quote. I demure.
I knew this action was coming, and I asked him to sit this one out. I did not offer to take his place.
He wrote in a statement before the action:
I am 76 years old, a married Catholic priest, with 35 years of resistance to the empire’s wars, nine years of imprisonment, numberless arrests, surveillance and ‘dirty tricks’ from the FBI… Enter my friends, sometimes brusquely: ‘Hey Dads!! Give it up to the young pups. It’s rocking chair time…’ But, but, but… I cannot forget the dying children of Iraq, and the two million Iraqis dead from our war, sanctions and depleted uranium… I cannot forget my country’s war psychosis — its obsession with better tools for killing, its mammoth war chest, its think tanks and war labs.
My dad is sentenced to 30 months in jail. “They were prepared for the worst,” my mom says outside the courthouse afterward, “and they got it.”
He serves some of his sentence in a youth facility in rural Maryland. My brother, sister and I visit him there often. (There is an outlet mall nearby). He is the only white person in the visiting room — save for some of the corrections officers. The visiting room was designed for discomfort. It has this chest-level barrier between the inmates and the visitors, and you can’t lean on it to be closer to your family member. It is brutally loud. The boys all call him Pops and show him concern and respect. At some point, he was moved to a jail in Ohio that is more age appropriate, where we visit as often as we can.
He is released right before Christmas 2001. Friends welcome him back to “minimum security.” He dies less than a year later, on Dec. 6, 2002.
The Bulletin of the Atomics Scientists ’ Doomsday Clock stood at 7 minutes to nuclear midnight , the same time as when it was created in 1947. In the wake of September 11, 2001, the scientists wrote: “Moving the clock’s hands at this time reflects our growing concern that the international community has hit the ‘snooze’ button rather than respond to the alarm… More than 31,000 nuclear weapons are still maintained by the eight known nuclear powers, a decrease of only 3,000 since 1998. Ninety-five percent of these weapons are in the United States and Russia, and more than 16,000 are operationally deployed.”
Over most of the next decade and a half, our mom continues to live in the community she formed with my dad and others and continues to bear witness at the Pentagon, the White House and other sites of power. She keeps animals — goats, llamas, donkeys, even sheep for a while, and starts painting again. She is arrested repeatedly, but not for any big actions. I leave New York City for a small town in eastern Connecticut, get married and have three kids.
My brother and sister settle down too. My brother has three kids, lives in a Catholic Worker community in Michigan that he founded with his wife and another couple. My sister studies to be a physical therapist, becomes a doctor, falls in love with a doctor of English and lives in Grand Rapids. We are all arrested occasionally, but not for any big action. We march, we organize, we speak. We try.
As our mother approaches and passes 70, we — like many people our age — start encouraging her to take it easy, give up the rigors of community life and resistance, the constant hosting and demonstrating. We envision and invite her to live a life with her grandchildren, stories, bedtimes, sporting events and art projects. We have room, we all say.
She goes in the exact opposite direction. With others taking the reins at Jonah House, she feels free for the first time since our father’s death to be a Plowshares activist again, to conspire with her friends and to plan for a rigorous and daring action.
We don’t know the specifics, but as all her answers about the future muddle into a very specific kind of vagueness, we know exactly what is going on.
“Please don’t,” we say.“You are too old,” we say.“Think of your grandkids,” we say.
“I will. I’m not. I am. This is what I have to give.”
April 4, 2018
It was just three days after my 44th birthday, which was also Easter — again. We received word of a new plowshares action. Seven Catholic activists entered Kings Bay Naval Submarine Base in St. Mary’s, Georgia. They went to make real the prophet Isaiah’s command to “beat swords into plowshares.” The seven chose to act on the 50th anniversary of the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr., who devoted his life to addressing what he called the “triple evils of militarism, racism and materialism.” Carrying hammers and baby bottles of their own blood, the seven attempted to convert weapons of mass destruction. They hoped to call attention to the ways in which nuclear weapons kill every day, just by their mere existence and maintenance. They are charged with three federal felonies and one misdemeanor for their actions. They could face 25 years in prison if convicted on all counts.
And there they still are. Three — my mom, Father Steve Kelly and Mark Colville — remain in county jail almost a year later. They still do not have a trial date. The other four are out on bond, wearing ankle monitors and are required to check in with their minders at regular intervals.
The Kings Bay Naval Station is home to at least six nuclear ballistic missile submarines. Each carries 20 Trident II D 5 MIRV thermonuclear weapons. Each of these individual Trident thermonuclear weapons contains four or more individual nuclear weapons ranging in destructive power from a 100 kilotons to 475 kilotons. To understand the massive destructive power of these weapons remember that the nuclear bomb dropped on Hiroshima was a 15 kiloton bomb.
My mother feels very useful in jail — generous, empathetic and calm in a place that encourages none of those qualities.
The wheels of justice grind very slowly in Georgia particularly because the activists are mounting a creative legal defense. They seek to portray their actions as protected under the freedom of religion, using the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which allowed the homophobic cake makers to not make a cake for a gay couple. They are seeking to demonstrate their “deeply held religious beliefs” and how the practice of their religion has been burdened by the government’s response to their actions. The Religious Freedom Restoration Act requires the government to take claims of sincere religious exercise seriously.
Please keep them in thought and prayer .
Just a few months before they acted, the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists moved the clock again — this time to 2 minutes to nuclear midnight , saying, “This is a dangerous time, but the danger is of our own making. Humankind has invented the implements of apocalypse; so can it invent the methods of controlling and eventually eliminating them.”
The clock has never been closer to nuclear midnight in my lifetime. All the work, all this sacrifice, and the clock keeps moving closer to midnight.
My mom’s action and extended incarceration pre-trial come as nuclear conflagration seems more likely. Nuclear weapons do not even rate in the list of top 10 fears that Americans are questioned about every year.
Putin and Trump have shredded the imperfect and imbalanced but nevertheless important fabric of nuclear arms control treaties. Putin claims that Russia is developing a new class of “invincible” nuclear weapons, including a cruise missile that can reach anywhere in the world.
The Pentagon signaled recently that the United States would begin tests on a couple of types of missiles. And just to make things truly terrifying, Anthony Cordesman of the Center for Strategic and International Studies says that in response to U.S. and Russian actions, China is improving its own nuclear arsenal.
Searching for signs of hope to counter as a bulwark against these mounting fears, I hold close the work of the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons, or ICAN. It developed the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons and is now building a global civil society coalition to promote adherence to and full implementation of the nuclear weapons ban. ICAN received the 2017 Nobel Peace Prize “for its work to draw attention to the catastrophic humanitarian consequences of any use of nuclear weapons and for its ground-breaking efforts to achieve a treaty-based prohibition of such weapons.” I draw hope from that movement.
Nuclear weapons ruined my life.
I am never not thinking about them. Nuclear weapons are present in my most mundane tasks. Nuclear weapons are present in all my major relationships. Every goodbye and hello is freighted with uncertainty.
They have shaped how I think about time. Nuclear weapons have caused me to honor and treasure the present. They have made the future provisional, muted, not taken for granted. I try to be present to the present and hold the future loosely, but with hope.
Nuclear weapons ruined my life. And I wouldn’t have it any other way. In fact, I hope they are ruining your life too. Because that is the only way we are going to get rid of them.

The message reads, in part:
“I would like to note that the prevention and resolution of conflicts in labour relations is a complicated and highly topical task that requires special professional knowledge and skills. It is therefore important that St Petersburg University of the Humanities and Social Sciences, affiliated with trade unions, has established and successfully runs a conflictology department.
Its main mission is to train skilled specialists, to conduct research projects and to chart modern approaches towards resolving social and labour disagreements.
Of course, the University also plays an important role in organising your conference, which traditionally brings together representatives of government agencies, the trade union movement, the expert and teaching communities and business circles.
I am confident that the current meeting will be up to the mark, and that it will help resolve pressing issues linked with the harmonisation of labour relations, the consolidation of social partnership in Russia and will help streamline legislation in this sphere, with due consideration for the best national and foreign experience.”

A Cure for Excessive Wealth Disorder,www.therussophile.org,Chuck Collins,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/a-cure-for-excessive-wealth-disorder.html/,"— from OtherWords
The U.S. is suffering from excessive wealth disorder.
This isn’t your parents’ inequality influenza, but a more virulent strain of extreme disparities of income, wealth, and opportunity.
Just 400 billionaires have as much wealth as nearly two-thirds of American households combined. And just three individuals — Jeff Bezos, Warren Buffett, and Bill Gates — have as much wealth as half of all U.S. households put together.
Since the economic meltdown of 2008, the lion’s share of income and wealth growth hasn’t gone just to the top 1 percent — it’s gone to the richest one-tenth of 1 percent . This 0.1 percent includes households with annual incomes starting at $2.2 million and wealth over $20 million.
This group has been the big winner of the last few decades. Its share of national income rose from 6 percent in 1995 to 11 percent in 2015. But their biggest gains are in wealth, increasing their share from 7 percent in 1978 to over 21 percent today.
That’s 210 times their share of the population.
When you have over $20 million, you’ve easily taken care of all your needs and those of the next generation of your family. You’re living in comfort, probably with multiple homes, and don’t want for anything.
It’s at this point we see the telltale signs of excessive wealth disorder. Despite being already comfortable beyond measure, segments of this 0.1 percent will often invest their wealth to rig the political rules to get even more wealth and power.
They contribute the legal maximum donations to politicians and then do an end run around campaign finance laws to siphon even larger sums through “dark money” SuperPACs, using corporate entities that don’t have to disclose donors.
When this donor class demands tax cuts, their political puppets kick into overdrive to deliver the goods.
The 0.1 percenters create charitable foundations that become extensions of their own power and privilege. They undermine the health of the nonprofit sector by controlling a growing share of the charitable giving pie.
They deploy their wealth to help their kids get into elite colleges, both through donations and, as we’ve seen recently, outright bribery.
It’s clear the rest of society needs to intervene. Excessive wealth disorder is wrecking life for the rest of us.
What can we do? We need to put forward a “plutocracy prevention program” — public policies to reduce the power of this top 0.1 percent group.
Some presidential candidates are stepping forward with bold ideas. Senator Elizabeth Warren’s wealth tax idea is a courageous step in this direction. She’s proposed a 2 percent annual tax on wealth over $50 million, with a 3 percent rate on wealth over $1 billion.
Progressive Democrats have proposed raising the top marginal tax rate to 70 percent on households with incomes over $10 million. Senators Kamala Harris and Bernie Sanders both have proposals to make the estate tax more progressive and slow the accumulation of dynastic wealth.
Polls show widespread popular support for these proposals. All of them face steep sledding in a Congress beholden to the top 0.1 percent donor class.
One first step might be a proposal that exclusively targets the 0.1 percent class. How about a 10 percent income surtax on incomes over $2 million, including capital gains?
That’s not as steep as a 70 percent marginal rate, but it would move us in the right direction. It would raise substantial revenue — an estimated $70 billion a year and $750 billion over the next decade — from those with the greatest capacity to pay.
Bringing such a proposal to a vote would require lawmakers to make a clear choice: Are you with the vast majority of voters who believe the super-rich should pay more? Or are you carrying water for the richest 0.1 percent?"

Saudi Arabia has reopened its consulate in Iraq as Riyadh seeks closer ties with Baghdad amid Iran’s growing relations with his neighboring Arab country following the defeat of Daesh.
The diplomatic mission in the Iraqi capital of Baghdad was inaugurated on Thursday during a ceremony attended by senior Iraqi and Saudi officials.
Saudi Minister of Trade Majid bin Abdullah al-Qasabi was leading a business delegation to Iraq as part of efforts to enhance ties between the two nations.
Following the reopening of the consulate, he told reporters that the move marked a “new phase” in relations between Riyadh and Baghdad.
Al-Qasabi also said that the kingdom would provide Iraq with one billion dollars in loans for development projects plus $500 million to boost exports and a gift of a 100,000-seat sports stadium to be built on Baghdad’s outskirts.
Saudi Arabia cut off diplomatic ties with Iraq and closed its Baghdad embassy in 1990 after then Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait. The mission was reopened in January 2016.
But consular services remained suspended and Iraqis applying for visas had to go through the Saudi embassy in neighboring Jordan.
The Saudi minister said three more consulates will be launched in three Iraqi cities in the near future.
During the ceremony, Iraqi Foreign Ministry spokesman Ahmad Sahhaf also said the reopening was expected to benefit both countries.
The visit by the Saudi mission came after Iranian President Hassan Rouhani visited Iraq on March 11 to boost bilateral ties between the two neighboring nations. Dozens of key cooperation and trade documents were signed during Rouhani’s trip.
Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi is scheduled to pay an official visit to Iran on Saturday. He will visit Saudi Arabia later this month.
Riyadh has viewed Iraq’s proximity to Iran with enmity. This is while Iraqi leaders have repeatedly praised Iran’s role in helping the Arab country confront the Takfiri menace.
The reopening of the Saudi embassy comes as Iraqi officials have frequently accused Riyadh of abetting the Daesh Takfiri terrorist group, which was largely defeated in Iraq and Syria in late 2017. Baghdad managed to defeat the terror group thanks to support from its allies, including Iran.
Back in 2016, Iraq’s ambassador to the UN, Mohammad Ali al-Hakim, accused Saudi Arabia of financing the Daesh terrorist group.
He also called on the international community to take tougher actions against the countries that back terrorism in any form.

Iran speeds up 'relief train' to help flash flood victims,www.therussophile.org,Michael Sullivan,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/iran-speeds-up-relief-train-to-help-flash-flood-victims.html/,"This post was originally published on this site

Following more than two weeks of heavy rain and nearly nationwide flooding, Iran has continued efforts to transport relief to flood-stricken areas, including a new initiative to set up a “relief train”.
Railways of the Islamic Republic of Iran (RAI) head Saeid Rasouli announced on Thursday that coordination had been made to distribute the needed relief using the railway system.
Rasouli added that with the cooperation of other governmental bodies, the railway system had already coordinated the transportation of more than 14,000 bottles of water, 10,000 food cans, 500 blankets and also other needed material, including aid-loaded transport vehicles.
The railway system will transport the aid to the flood-stricken areas of Lorestan and Khuzestan.
The announcement comes as floods have affected at least 23 of the country’s 31 provinces since heavy downpours began on March 19.
Major floods have been reported in the provinces of Golestan, Mazandaran, Gilan, Kordestan, Lorestan, Fars, Northern Khorasan, Kermanshah, Khuzestan, Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad as well as Sistan and Baluchestan.
Estimates by government agencies suggest that the floods have taken the lives of at least 67 people and destroyed over 25,000 homes around the country.
Lorestan is said to have suffered the second highest amount of casualties after the Fars Province, based on official reports.
More anticipated rainfall
Iran’s Meteorological Organization announced on Thursday that the country would see a new wave of rainfall entering the country as of Friday afternoon.
The rain is expected to be much less than the recent record-breaking rainfalls, but given that many waterways are already full to their maximum capacity, the organization announced that the precipitation can exacerbate the situation.
Ongoing nationwide relief efforts
Speaking to reporters earlier on Friday, Deputy Road and Construction Minister Abul Hashem Hassannia said that the recent floods were a rare and unprecedented event and that a processional board will be set up to assess the flood relief operations.
He added that opening inaccessible transportation paths was his main priority.
“Crisis management requires one to create a balance between what one needs and his capacity. When our capacity is outstripped, we have to prioritize,” said Hassannia.
Based on media reports, Iranian Interior Minister Abdolreza Rahmani-Fazli and head of the Khatam-al Anbiya Construction Headquarters Saied Mohammad have both entered Khuzestan Province to supervise ongoing relief efforts in the region.
Having arrived in Lorestan, Mohammad said that his organization has so far assisted in the reparation of existing roads and the creation of temporary transportation routes made inaccessible by the flooding.
He added that the Khatam-al Anbiya Construction Headquarters has also assisted in clearing, diverging and deepening waterways in order to reduce the flooding.
Other relief efforts have continued nonstop across the country, with professional and voluntary relief teams being sent to many flood-stricken areas. Helicopters have also been used to get aid to locations made inaccessible by the floods.
Much effort is also being put in enforcing existing floodwalls and creating new ones to withstand major flooding in populous areas.

IAEA visits Iran site which exposed Netanyahu's lie: Report,www.therussophile.org,Michael Sullivan,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/iaea-visits-iran-site-which-exposed-netanyahus-lie-report.html/,"This post was originally published on this site

The UN nuclear agency says it has inspected a site in Tehran which Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu last year described as a “secret atomic warehouse” but it turned out to be a carpet cleaning facility.
Netanyahu claimed at the United Nations in September that the site housed 15 kg of unspecified radioactive material, citing it as testimony to his frivolous allegations that Tehran sought to obtain nuclear weapons.
The claim angered the International Atomic Energy Agency which has repeatedly confirmed the peaceful nature of Iran’s nuclear program after many inspections. At the time, the agency said it does not take information presented to it at face value and sends inspectors “only when needed”.
On Thursday, Reuters quoted three three diplomats familiar with the agency’s work as saying that IAEA inspectors have visited the site.
One of the diplomats said the IAEA had been to the site more than once last month, the news agency reported. The others said the agency had been there, without specifying when.
“We have nothing to hide and any access given to the IAEA so far has been in the framework of laws and regulations and nothing beyond that,” Reuters also quoted an unnamed Iranian official as saying.
Quarterly IAEA reports say its inspectors have had access to all the places in Iran they have needed to visit, which IAEA chief Yukiya Amano repeated in a speech on Tuesday.
Such reports do not please Israel which has been stealing nuclear secrets and covertly making bombs since the 1950s.
Israel’s nuclear program has been an open secret since a disgruntled technician, Mordechai Vanunu, blew the whistle on it in 1986, but the official Israeli position is still never to confirm or deny its existence.
Israel also makes controversial claims against Iran’s nuclear program from time to time, which are often met with ridicule.
Netanyahu’s most recent spectacle at the UN in September drew swift reaction on social media, with Twitter users posting largely derisive comments.
After the speech, many Iranians took selfies in front of the carpet cleaning center in Turquzabad which Netanyahu claimed was a “secret atomic warehouse”.

Forces loyal to Libya’s strongman Khalifa Haftar have been pushed back from a key checkpoint a day after they managed to seize the control of a town in the south of the capital Tripoli.
Forces of the so-called Libyan National Army (LNA) were driven from the checkpoint less than 30 kilometers from Tripoli after a “short exchange of fire” on Friday, according to security sources.
They also said dozens of pro-Haftar forces had been captured and their vehicles seized.
The Tripoli Protection Force – an alliance of the county’s internationally recognized government in the capital — confirmed that its fighters had taken part in the recapture of the checkpoint.
Haftar’s LNA had claimed that its advance on the country’s west was meant to root out what it called “terrorist groups” in the restive region.
Libya has been the scene of increasing violence since 2011, when former dictator Muammar Gaddafi was toppled from power after an uprising and a NATO military intervention.
His ouster created a huge power vacuum, leading to chaos and the emergence of numerous militant outfits, including the Takfiri Daesh terrorist group.
The oil-rich country is now divided between two rival governments —the House of Representatives, based in the eastern city of Tobruk, and the internationally-recognized government of Fayez al-Sarraj, or the Tripoli-based unity Government of National Accord (GNA).
The recent escalation has prompted the UN Security Council to call for an emergency meeting on Friday.
UN chief Antonio Guterres who was visiting Tripoli also voiced his “deep concern” about the recent conflict, calling “for calm and restraint as I prepare to meet the Libyan leaders in the country.”
The United Nations is scheduled to hold a conference later this month in the southwestern Libyan city of Ghadames to discuss a political solution to the conflict and stabilize country.

The camera clicks cause all eyes in the hall to switch disapprovingly from the reading material in front of them to the photographer – the source of unwelcome noise. “Keep silence” here is as common a sign as “No smoking” on board a plane.
Anton Belitskiy
The moment we show up with our photographic gear, the library supervisors, like hawks, swoop on us from all sides, demanding to see our permission to take photos (thankfully, we have it on us). With custodians such as these, the largest book collection in Russia need never fear for its security.
Anton Belitskiy Some history
Initially, the library collection was formed from the personal collection of manuscripts and rare books of Count Nikolai Rumyantsev, a Russian statesman. By personal order of Nicholas I, the Rumyantsev Museum was founded in St Petersburg in 1828. Over time, however, it could not withstand the competition from other institutions in Russia’s then capital, so the decision was taken to relocate the institution to Moscow. It was assigned one of the most beautiful buildings right outside the Kremlin walls, Pashkov House.
Anton Belitskiy
After the 1917 Revolution, the library flourished. The capital followed the library to Moscow, and the Rumyantsev Museum essentially became the country’s main depository of books; a new building and indeed a new book depository were subsequently built for it. Today, the library buildings occupy an entire block. And Pashkov House is also home to a music section, as well as a manuscripts and cartography department.
Anton Belitskiy
In Soviet times, the Rumyantsev Museum was renamed the Lenin State Library of the USSR, in whose honor the nearby subway station, opened in 1935, was christened Biblioteka imeni Lenina (Lenin Library). In more recent times, the library shed its Lenin prefix, but by then the name had stuck, and it is still referred to today as the Leninka.
Anton Belitskiy
In 2013, a special library department and reading room opened at Moscow’s Jewish Museum and Tolerance Center. It houses the Schneerson Library – a collection of religious and secular literature by Hasidic Jews. Since then, however, the materials in the collection have been completely digitized . Some modernity
Visiting the library of, say, Oxford University in Britain, one feels the hand of ancient history resting on the shoulder. Likewise, the Leninka plunges the curious visitor into the past, nearer in time, yet still gone. Green halls, cloth-covered tables, lamps – it is embalmed socialism with a human face, and perhaps the best that remains of the lost Soviet empire.
Anton Belitskiy
The Leninka is never empty, its cloakroom always buzzing with people. Every second, young women in short skirts and bespectacled professors ascend the main staircase of exquisite beauty. An eccentric fire-red haired lady of indeterminate age, humming something to herself, strides confidently into the music section, clearly a frequenter.
Anton Belitskiy
Inside the library are several reading rooms kitted out with computers, as well as endless corridors and recesses with reading desks. The conveyor belt continuously churns out all kinds of volumes and folios from the book depository. Yours truly has time to catch sight of an Italian teach-yourself guide, a book on the basics of accounting, and a rare edition of Boris Pasternak.
Anton Belitskiy
For some pilgrims, the library is a near religious experience – a ritual replete with antique books and tables with the old-world scent of wooden cabinets, parquet floors, and history itself hanging in the air. Switched on, the legendary green lamps plunge the room into an atmosphere of wonder.
Anton Belitskiy
A smartly dressed elderly gentleman examines a manuscript through a magnifying glass, nearby sits a stern-looking middle-aged woman in glasses, clearly a teacher. Their neighbor is a bearded professor, and one table away a group of students are taking selfies. Other students, Chinese, are diligently studying Russian (making up for time lost on less academic activities).
Anton Belitskiy
In the hall with card files, the atmosphere is more relaxed. A pensioner reads freshly pressed magazines so as not to purchase them. At the next table, a man in a tracksuit is solving a crossword puzzle. Is he passing time before catching a train? Or just exercising the grey cells? On the topic of exercise, some even do the physical kind. One visitor, for instance, spreads out a rubber sheet in a remote corridor and does gymnastics, nourishing the mind and body in true Ancient Greek style.
Anton Belitskiy Some numbers
Today, the library houses more than 47 million units of storage in 367 languages, including some rare Oriental ones. In addition to publications (the library receives an obligatory copy of all printed works), there are rare manuscripts, printed versions of visual arts, photo materials, maps, sheet music, periodicals, regulatory acts, military literature, and, of course, literature on the art of librarianship. Here, one can also find every dissertation written in the country since 1951.
Anton Belitskiy
The library has 36 reading rooms open to visitors, and Wi-Fi is near ubiquitous. Around 100,000 new users register annually. Employees offer up an interesting statistic: Every minute the library doors are opened by five visitors.
Anton Belitskiy
The Leninka is currently in the process of digitizing its archives. Its electronic library already has 1.3 million documents, not to mention access to remote electronic databases, including those of Cambridge University Press and Springer Publishing, various online library databases, and the JSTOR archive of digitized journals. The full list is available on the Leninka website .
Anton Belitskiy Some tips
Citizens at least 14 years old of any country can register at the library. And it is absolutely free – all that’s required is a piece of ID (plus passport and visa for those without visa-free entry to Russia).
Anton Belitskiy
The procedure takes no more than ten minutes. You will be photographed and issued a plastic library card. Students often joke that the mugshot on your Leninka card is bound to be the worst you’ve ever had (you can always blame the photographer). That said, these days it’s possible to sign up online .
Anton Belitskiy
After registration, you will need to offload your coat and any large bags or rucksacks to the cloakroom. One small bag and a laptop can be taken inside.
Anton Belitskiy
The library is open from 9 am to 8 pm every day except Sunday. Be prepared to have to wait for the book you want, perhaps even a few hours while it gets delivered from the book depository. If time is short, you can always order a book and pick it up the next day.
Anton Belitskiy
For many a long year, the Leninka had a reputation as a place for meeting one’s better half – a wife or husband from a respectable professorial family. Some visited the library with this specific purpose in mind. If the walls of the Leninka smoking room could talk, they would tell quite a story. For it was here that romantic hopefuls came to chat so as not to violate the hallowed silence of the reading rooms.
Anton Belitskiy
In the Oscar-winning movie Moscow Doesn’t Believe in Tears , the heroine, a provincial student, pines away in the Leninka reading hall, eyeing up any number of suitable matches, before heading into the smoking room, where two young academics simultaneously offer her a light. According to the library supervisors, visitors still ask about the famous smoking room, but alas, it is no longer there – smoking is now prohibited inside the building. But don’t despair, there’s a wonderful canteen instead. If that’s not a place for kindred souls to find each other, what is?

In the early hours of April 5, warplanes of the Russian Aerospace Forces conducted several airstrikes on terrorist positions in the southern Idlib countryside.
Syrian opposition sources said that the Russian airstrikes targeted the town of Khan Shaykhun. The strategic town is controlled by Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the former branch of al-Qaeda in Syria.
Few hours earlier, the terrorists launched a barrage of rockets at the Christian town of Mahardah in the government-held part of the northern Hama countryside. The Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA) said the attack killed one civilian and injured three others.
The Ministry of Defense of Russia has not commented on reprots about these airstrikes so far. However, there is a good chance that these airstrikes were a response to the deadly rocket attack on Mahardah.
HTS and its allies, which are violating the Russian-Turkish demilitarized zone agreement on a daily basis, were likely behind the attack. Turkish forces that conduct patrols in the demilitarized zone have failed to put an end to their violations so far.

Recent US remarks regarding the allged Iranian involvement in the deaths of at least 608 US service members are an attempt “to invent another pretext to justify a rapid escalation in relations with Iran” , Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mariya Zakharova said during a press briefing on April 4.
“I was surprised to read the startling, as I see it, statement by Brian Hook, the US Special Representative for Iran, alleging that Iran is responsible for the deaths of 608 US service members in Iraq. We have not heard of any military clashes between Americans and Iranians in Iraq. And so our colleagues in Washington should provide an explanation as to what they specifically mean by Teheran’s involvement.
We do understand that anti-Iranian sentiment in Washington is running high but there should be at least some facts to support statements made and accountability for what is said ,” the diplomat stressed.
She continued by saying that “Washington is trying to invent another pretext to justify a rapid escalation in relations with Iran if it deems it expedient”. Zakharova warned Washington against “such steps because they are fraught with catastrophic consequences for stability in the Middle East, which is in disarray even without it.”
“Getting back to Hook’s statement, I would like to ask what the United States was doing in Iraq anyway? Why did they invade the country, essentially destroying it, in 2003? The US occupation led to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Iraqis, most of whom were civilians. I would like to stress that there is no exact figure. Nobody has counted the civilian population killed there. There was a separate set of statistics for troops.
For example, we remember the video of 2007 that shows Blackwater private security company personnel shooting unarmed people with a machinegun in Bagdad. Who will answer for those victims? But they must be counted first.
And who will answer for the killing of 290 passengers of the Iranian plane shot down by a missile launched from a US cruiser in the Persian Gulf in 1988? Would Mr Hook like to speak on this subject? Has anybody in Washington apologised for all those victims? “, she added.
The diplomat added that there is no secret that “ it was the US invasion in Iraq that resulted in the emergence of ISIS .”
“It brought additional suffering to the people of Iraq and neighboring Syria as well as to many other countries. Moreover, it created additional risks to global security because ISIS militants have dispersed all around the world now, and yet Western countries have reported that ISIS has been destroyed. Maybe they meant in Syria only? Yet, they are also still there, unfortunately. We see their crimes all over the world.
There should be no doubts that the US intervention in Iraq will remain in history as a grave violation of international law and, in fact, a criminal act. We advise the United States to stop seeking pretexts for new conflicts, increasing suffering all around the world with its aggressive policy,” Zakharova stated.
On April 2, Advisor to the Secretary of State Brian Hook said that Iran is responsible for the deaths of at least 608 US service members in Iraq in the period from 2003 to 2011 . Besides this Hook came with a wide list of accusations blaiming and shaming Iran for its “meddling” in affairs of Middle Eastern states.
While these remarks added nothing new to the US stance towards Iran, they openly showed that Washington is not interested in a de-escalation of relations with the Middle Eastern country. MORE ON THE TOPIC:"
Russia Slams “Provocative Statements” By NATO Secretary General,www.therussophile.org,uchfkaf32,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/russia-slams-provocative-statements-by-nato-secretary-general.html/,"This post was originally published on this site

On April 4, A spokesperson for the Russian Foreign Ministry, Mariya Zakharova, came with an official statement slamming recent “provocative” remarks by NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg. Provocative statements by NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg ( source ):
In his remarks to the US Congress, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg mentioned Josef Stalin in the same breath with Adolf Hitler and ISIS, and said that “Stalin could not have been deterred with words.” He was attempting to form some absurd historical-logic chain.
The Russian Foreign Ministry has already commented at a high level on that stupid statement. Specifically, Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko noted that people in Norway were burning with shame at Stoltenberg’s words yesterday, as the Red Army liberated the country from Nazis.
I would like to add two remarks to this eloquent assessment.
First, the Norwegian people greatly appreciated the Red Army’s contribution to the liberation of their country. I think the problem is that all of them are simply poorly educated. The quality of Western education is a big myth as we can see it from the UK example. Many Western politicians are known for their absurd and stupid statements that have no relation to facts. I would like to recall what King Haakon VII of Norway said in his October 26, 1944 radio address: “We have been following the heroic and triumphant struggle of the Soviet Union against our common enemy with admiration and enthusiasm. It is the duty of each Norwegian to render maximum support to our Soviet ally.”
The NATO Secretary General is a Norwegian. Moreover, I hope that he knows that the Red Army liberated a northern region of his country – East Finnmark – from Nazi invaders. In that operation 2,122 Soviet service members were killed in Norway. How are we to assess the statement of a person who heads a major military-political organisation, on the one hand, and is a political figure, on the other?
Second, if Stoltenberg cared about the fate of the world, the civilian population or people’s suffering then, especially as he was addressing the US Congress, he would have done better to recall US President Bill Clinton or NATO Secretary General Javier Solana, who directed the bombing of Yugoslavia. How did he miss them in that logic chain? They were the right people to speak about. How they dropped ordnance on peaceful civilians. For example, not a word has been said about the NATO’s – in particular the US’s and other Western countries’ – role in Libya. I have already mentioned George Bush, Iraq and the hundreds of thousands of victims. For some reason, Mr Stoltenberg did not say a single word about George Bush but he should have. I attribute it all to a poor education.

China’s Linkspace Aerospace Technology Group conducted flight tests of the NewLine reusable rocket prototype. NewLine Baby, or RLV-T5 as it is officially known, is 8.1 metres high. It has a weight of 1.5 tons and uses five liquid rocket engines in parallel to get it off the ground.
According to a released video, the rocket hovered in place for 10 seconds after rising to a height of 20 metres during a test flight in eastern China’s Shandong province. According to reprots, the test was designed to check various technologies, including multiple engine thrust adjustment, multiple start, vector nozzle, and roll control ready for subsequent testing at increased heights.
While the rocket itself includes no fresh know how, the private Chinese aerospace company is going to conquer suborbital launch market with this rocket.
“A solid-fuelled sounding rocket now costs 2 to 3 million yuan [$300,000-450,000],” Chu Longfei, LinkSpace’s chief technology officer said. “Our product will cost around one-fifth of that price.”

Additionally, Linkspace Aerospace Technology Group is working on the NewLine-1, a two-stage rocket with a reusable first stage designed to launch microsats and nanosats. This rocekt is fuelled by liquid oxygen and kerosene in its first stage and has a height of 20 metres. The rocket’s maiden launch is scheduled for 2020.
In March, another Chinese private firm, OneSpace, conducted a maiden laucnh of its OS-M solid propellant rocket. The OS-M1 has a length of 19m and a diameter of 2m. According to official claims, it’s capable of carrying a 205-kilogram payload to 300-kilometer low Earth orbit, and 73 kilograms to 800-kilometer sun-synchronous orbit.
However, the OSM-1 maiden launch, which took place in late March, failed shortly after entering second stage flight.

Detained Suspect Claims Attack On U.S. Forces In Manbij Was Planned & Prepared In Idlib,www.therussophile.org,another_try,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/detained-suspect-claims-attack-on-u-s-forces-in-manbij-was-planned-prepared-in-idlib.html/,"This post was originally published on this site

The January 16 bombing which claimed the lives of four Americans in Syria’s Manbij was planned and prepared in the militant-held governorate of Idlib, one of the attack perpetrators confessed in a video released by the Hawar News Agency (ANHA) on April 5.
ANHA, which is known for its ties with the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), identified the suspect in the video as 27-year old Abdul Aziz Mohammed al-Shajyi. The terrorist, who is originally from the town of Tell Abyad, joined ISIS in 2014 and fled to the SDF-held city of Manbij three years later. Abdul Aziz Mohammed al-Shajyi
Al-Shajyi said in the video that he met the planner of Manbij bombing, who is known only his nom de guerre “Abu Ali,” few months after arriving in the city. A mediator by the name Abu Nada al-Kurdi introduced the two terrorists to each other inside a mosque in Manbij.
According to the available information, Abu Ali is originally from Idlib. The terrorist commander was heading ISIS’ al-Hijrah Office in the city of Raqqa in the early years of the self-proclaimed caliphate. The office was responsible for coordinates the movements of foreign terrorists between Syria and Turkey.
“Abu Ali asked me about the living conditions in Manbij and the situation in general, especially the whereabouts of international coalition forces and where they are stationed,” Al-Shajyi said describing his first meeting with Abu Ali.
Abu Ali went back to Idlib after his first meeting with al-Shajyi. Later the terrorist commander returned to Manbij and monitored several convoys of the US-led coalition. Al-Shajyi said that Abu Ali became furious when he found out that coalition vehicles are equipped with mobile phone jammers and immediately returned to Idlib.
After returning to Idlib for the second time, Abu Ali phoned al-Shajyi and told him that he want him to shelter a man named Abu Yasin that will arrive in Manbij soon. The man will be later known as the suicide bomber of Manbij attack. In a press release by its news agency, Amaq, ISIS mentioned his full nom de guerre “Abu Yasin al-Shami.” According to al-Shajyi, the man is originally from the countryside of Homs.
On the day of the attack, January 16, Abu Ali returned to from Idlib to Manbij and met with al-Shajyi and Abu Yasin inside a car. Al-Shajiy said that the terrorist had brought with him a bag full of explosives and handed it over to Abu Yasin, who embarked on his mission right away.
“Abu Ali immediately moved the car and entered the streets in the neighborhood, we heard huge explosion from the area where international coalition vehicles were parked,” al-Shajyi said in the confession video.
U.S. Army Chief Warrant Officer 2 Jonathan R. Farmer, Navy Chief Cryptologic Technician Shannon M. Kent, Department of Defense civilian employee Scott A. Wirtz and civilian interpreter Ghadir Taher were killed in Manbij attack, that also claimed the lives of ten Syrian civilians.
Abu Ali ordered al-Shajyi to destroy the phone that he used to communicate with him following the attack. However, this didn’t save al-Shajyi, as the SDF’s security forces were able to track him for several weeks before finally arresting him in a special operation on March 20 .
Al-Shajyi story complements the information provided by ISIS itself. If confirmed, these information represent another evidence of how Idlib has become the new safe haven for terrorists in Syria. More on this topic:"

TAVISTOCK INSTITUTE: Social Engineering the Masses by Daniel Estulin (Trine Day, 2015)
6 Stars – A Seminal Work Integrating Deep Looks from Others – A Mind-Altering Soul-Enhancing Book
Given the author’s past as a former Russian intelligence employee, I have considered the possibility that this book is an active disinformation treatise. While some of this information may be exaggerated or mis-interpreted, on balance I believe this to be a most valuable holistic perspective essential to taking down the Deep State.
My bottom line up front: the Deep State — the vestiges of the Black Nobility/Ceasar, the British Empire, the Vatican, the Zionists, and the Freemasons (33+ only – the rest can be saved) and their banking fronts including the Rothschilds and Central Banks — are the common enemies of America, China, and Russia as well as all other nation-states and cultural/ethnic/linguistic tribes. We are not doing well at collaborating against these common enemies.
This book floored me. Written in 2011 and republished in 2015, this book is one of three in the past ten years that have altered my perception of reality. The other two:
I thought I understood covert action and its subset propaganda. I did not. What this book makes clear, with meticulous naming of names (drawing on varied noted sources), is that virtually everything about our daily lives is propaganda, from church and school to the news to social media to government lies and “statistics.” I am a fan of Jon Rappoport’s work ( The Matrix and his blog No More Fake News ), I managed a false flag operation for the CIA, I have done a great deal to confront fake news, but this book leaves me almost breathless with disbelief. EVERYTHING is a programmed lie – I am reminded of Barbara Honegger’s IN THE ROOM recollection of William Casey telling Ronald Reagan:
“We’ll know our disinformation program is complete when everything the American public believes is false.”
Barbara Honegger, Quora , 25 November 2014
At the above link, do not miss Bill Bray, retired CIA scientist, on the fake news culture that CIA spawns.
The saddest and most troubling aspect of this book for me, as a former CIA operations officer, was its documentation of the degree to which CIA, in active collaboration with universities funded by the Rockefellers and other elites, deliberately created the drug culture in the 1960’s, liberally dispending LSD and other drugs, and in particularly, handing out 50,000 or so LSD tabs at Woodstock. The author is compelling in suggesting that the Grateful Dead (perhaps unwitting) were a covert operation by the CIA intended to introduce and then proliferate the drug and consciousness culture, reducing by a considerable number those able to reach adulthood without losing a substantial portion of their brain cells.
QUOTE (110): “At Woodstock,” writes journalist Donald Phau, “nearly half a million youth gathered to be drugged and brainwashed on a farm. The victims were isolated, immersed in filth, pumped with [free] psychedelic drugs, and kept awake continuously for three straight days, and all with the full complicity of the FBI and government officials.”
Decades later, and after Viet-Nam, we have the crack cocaine explosion at the intersection of the Nicaraguan contras, the US Marine Corps and El Toro, and the CIA.
Review: Dark Alliance–The CIA, the Contras, and the Crack Cocaine Explosion
The second most troubling aspect of this book for me, as a lapsed Catholic and still Christian who believes strongly in the family unit as the foundation for national power (along with the education of its citizens in the art of critical reasoned thinking) was the documentation of how the pill was explicitly invented and popularized (along with Affirmative Action) in order to break up families and foster a libertine culture harmful to children, at the same time that television and Hollywood were used to dumb down the popular and make all manner of perversions “normal.” Herbert Marcuse and others have defined “repressive tolerance” as the ultimate destroyer of family, community, and tribal values: when “anything goes,” which is the Democratic Party’s approach to life, then NOTHING is sacred.
Betty Boop: France Legalizes Pedophila — Any Child, Any Age UPDATE 1 Comment, Pedos are People Poster, Marcuse on “Repressive Tolerance”
Although the author relies heavily on one or two sources around which he builds a chapter, he has a gift for synthesis and a gift for narrative, and I have to say that this book is a capstone book – a book so important that if I had the money I would be handing out ten million copies tomorrow.
There is a Trumpian bottom line that I want to emphasize up front: the absolute worst nightmare for the Deep State and the 1% elite seeking to create a New World Order in which the 99% are dumbed down drugged up automatons, is a strong family unit and bottom up community ethos that values individual learning and independence of mind. We are at the tail end of fifty years of elite efforts to destroy our ability to think for ourselves while seeking to infect us with both physical and mental diseases, all the while carrying out eugenics and euthanasia programs ranging from vaccines that sterilize to wars based on 935 lies (Iraq).
Review: 935 Lies – The Future of Truth and the Decline of America’s Moral Integrity
We are in the midst of a moral and spiritual decline that has been deliberately contrived over the past seventy two years, since 1947 to be precise (the National Security Act and more). CIA was created by Wall Street to be its secret fixer and destabilizer not only abroad, but in the USA, establishing covert and controlled positions in every institution of significance including local law enforcement and of course state governments – Governor Jesse Ventura has spoken and written to this point.
There are three targets that the Deep State – the New World Order elitists – desire to destroy: the first is the individual, who cannot be allowed to be effectively armed, educated, and independent; the second is the family, which Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew once called the bedrock of civilization and which others have said is the precise opposite of the industrial slavery model; the second is the nation-state, that cannot be allowed to be effectively armed, educated, and independent.
The author, drawing on thin but balanced sources, excels at making it clear that all the chaos in the world is contrived – the whole point is to keep us all off balance and unable to realize that there is ample wealth for everyone if we simply come together with intelligence and integrity. We are being lied to, divided and conquered, drugged up, “herded,” and generally repressed mentally, spiritually, and physically. 600 lb people are not an accident – they are a symptom of a complete breakdown – BY DESIGN – of the cultural and social mores that characterize healthy people living in healthy communities.
The author excels at documenting – with the help of his few cited sources – the timeline from World War II to today – in which the psychological operations profession saw a marriage of the Nazis, the British, and the CIA, in service to the 1%, toward the end of asserting political control over everyone on the basis of driving everyone into a state of psychosis using programmed behavior modification.
The New World Order (One World Order) fascist corporate state demands the end of nationalism, the repression of languages and cultures and ethnic or cultural identities, the fragmentation of the family, and the dissolution of community. In other words, everything that we in “fly over” country or the rural heartland, believe is our essence. I cannot help but conclude that California and New York are now like the concentration camp or prison “trustees” of the neo-Nazi elitists, and this is one reason why the Electoral College is so important – to keep those two states populated by libertine morons from destroying America the Beautiful.
Early on the author talks about how the elites understand that local sheriffs loyal to their local communities are a major obstacle to the imposition of a “national” police regime, and I contemplate how we have since 9/11 – a false flag operation by the Zionists with the complicity of Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld (and then the post-event obstruction of justice and complicity in murder after the fact of Robert Mueller) – militarized our police and turned the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) into a national Gestapo that specializes in false flag operations from Sandy Hook to the Boston Bombing to Orlando and beyond.
Memoranda for the President on 9/11: Time for the Truth — False Flag Deep State Truth! UPDATE 14: Spanish Translation
The author covers MKULTRA and mind-control to an extent, and between this book and other reading I am now persuaded that virtually every “active shooter” since 9/11 has been a mind-controlled individual explicitly activated to terrorize us and justify even more draconian police measures.
QUOTE (13): Deliberate and habitual falsification of the information is a way of creating desensitization effects in the mass population by causing socially-accredited interpretation of cause-effect relations to violate sensuous rational interpretation of experience.”
The author offers some provocative information about Vladimir Putin as a Freemason also subject to MI-6 mind-control who freed himself. All I know if how much I do not know but I pray that Xi Jinping, Donald Trump, and Vladimir Putin are all talking and in the process of cleansing the top ranks of the Freemasons what I am told is the Chinese objective: to place the Freemasons on the side of the 99% and the creation of a prosperous world at peace that works for all.
Elitist control of the American Medical Association and the American Psychiatric Association (and follow ons, such as the morons who blessed water-boarding by the CIA) has been used to “game” mental health so that the dumbed-down obedient individual is considered “healthy” while the recalcitrant obstructionist is considered “unhealthy.” Control of these associations also enabled the repression of natural and alternative cures, substituting a panoply of drugs both legal and illegal, all intended to fragment and soften the mental and physical health of the population. Today just 1% of our youth are qualified for military service. The elite have been successful.
The authors adds to my knowledge of the breadth and depth of Nazi transplants to the CIA and to NASA, and the degree to which they were committed to mind-control, occult practices, and the liberal use of drugs to subjugate and enslave individuals. The point is made that over time research across America became so corrupted that only the collaborators survived – “honest academicians where generally weeded out and hounded into retirement.”
The central pivot in the book, from the theory to the practice to today, is chapter three, “Killing of the King,” which coherently, grippingly connects the assassination of John F. Kennedy (JFK) with all that followed including particularly the fragmentation and mind-fucking of America.
Although I have reviewed numerous books on the assassination of JFK, none have focused on Freemasons as much as this chapter does, drawing on other sources.
Reviews on Assassination of JFK
Although I have heard and read over the years of CIA and KGB Freemasons collaborating in betrayal of their countries and organizations by order of the Freemasons, this chapter more than anything I have seen before makes me wonder if we don’t need a Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) scrub of the Freemasons – of course we would have to deal with the fact that the President and virtually everyone of consequence in Congress, Justice, and the FBI is a high-ranking Freemason – which brings in the Chinese Freemasons. I know one of their leaders. Could they be the ones who finally purge global Freemasonry at the top and redirect it toward its more benign avowed goals? Or will we simply get a Chinese version of the Deep State leveraging the Freemasons outside of China to do China’s bidding?
What this chapter does is place the assassination of JFK in the context of a much larger scheme to destroy the innocence and quest for excellence that he inspired and that was inherent in the USA as “the greatest generation” left war behind, created families, and prepared to go to the moon and beyond.
The chapter is a treatise in symbolism, occult machinations, and the alchemy of a hidden government using the assassination as a form of trauma that is then followed by an orchestrated combination of music, movies, television shows, and the creation of a drug culture such that civic consciousness could be said to have been assassinated as well.
The next chapter, “The Doors of Perception: The CIA’s Psychedelic Revolution,” deepens our understanding of how the public was drugged up and dumbed down in the aftermath of the JFK assassination….by design.
I knew the lyrist for the Grateful Dead John Perry Barlow (RIP) and this I found shocking because I have continued to be naïve:
“An FBI internal memo from 1968 mentions the employment of the Grateful Dead as an avenue to ‘channel youth dissent and rebellion into more benign and non-threatening directions.’ [They] performed a vital service in distracting many young persons into drugs and mysticism, rather than politics.” He cites Jim Keith’s Mind Control, World Control (Adventures Unlimited Press, 1998), no page number. I learn that Jim Keith is the author of two other books I have not read, Mass Control: Engineering Human Consciousness (Adventures Unlimited Press, 2003), and also Secret and Suppressed: Banned Ideas and Hidden History (Feral House, 1993).
The author draws on multiple sources to show that the CIA orchestrated drug proliferation experiments at over eighty US university campuses with the intent of popularizing LSD, creating a drug counterculture that took an entire generation – or multiple generations – out of civics, out of politics. The intent was to turn people away from God and man in God’s (good) image, and instead transform America into a perverse complex of dehumanizing drug abuse, sexual perversion, and the glorification of violence. At its most extreme, the intent was to create multiple generations of murderous pedophiles and necrophiliacs. It worked.
The dumbing down of education, turning it into a rote memorization process devoid of critical thinking, to include the teaching of agnosticism, the elimination of core values – ethics – the denial of the nobility of man and the unlimited potential of man for creating heaven on Earth, the denial of “soul,” were all focused on creating an autistic population living in a virtual concentration camp. Add to this vaccines actually creating a massive number of truly autistic children, and the opioid crisis our own President has condemned, and one begins to see that we are at the tail end of a half century of deliberate genocide and ecocide. Add to this 5G and the alienation and ignorance inherent in what I have termed #GoogleGestapo, and the death knell of civilization is sounded.
It has been my horrible mistake to presume, wrongly, that information pathologies such as I have itemized in various works but with the following specific reviews (one by a guest), were calculated betrayals of the public trust but somehow isolated, temporal, reversible. I have been reading individual trees and not seeing the forest.
I have been in denial. Even in the past two years, as I have taken an interest in 9/11 and a series of false flag events and mind-controlled active shooters across the USA, I have been in denial of the obscenely broad, calculated, deep, intended, persistent nature of this organized threat to society – a threat that includes rogue elements of academia, civil society (labor unions and religions particularly), commerce, government, law enforcement, media, military, and non-government or non-profit “foundations” that turn out to be the true centers of evil.
We are at war, and the two political parties in the USA represent Satan – the repressive tolerance (anything goes including pedophilia) and authoritarian façade that has been conducting mass surveillance, militarizing the police, using false flag operations to advance an anti-gun agenda, drugging us, lying to us, all of it is “the plan.” President Donald Trump may or may not be part of the plan, as I write this I pray that his “America First” NATIONALISM will triumph and his tongue-kissing of Benjamin Netanyahu is merely a temporary deception. #UNRIG, the unity for integrity electoral reform movement I founded, I can now see is half of the solution – the other solution is a completely independent Web 3.0 that cannot be censored, where individuals cannot be lied to and also digitally assassinated, as is the case today with Amazon, Facebook, Google, MeetUp, Twitter, and YouTube.
The “left” – and Noam Chomsky does not fare well in this chapter – was creating to pre-empt the radicalization of the growing middle class and college educated youth. I am reminded of the Great Depression, which was created by the banks, with the complicity of two Presidents, to destroy the middle class rising in political power while concentrating their own power over government and buying up land at depression level prices. That story is told by my friend and brilliant economist Wayne Jett.
Review: The Fruits of Graft
The chapter on “Television” is one of the longest and most valuable. Television is how everyone is “educated” to the same low level, homogenized, made politically correct, distracted, brainwashed, and turned against everything that is the opposite of television: civics, community, country, culture, ethics, family, and more. Television is about fostering apathy and ignorance. Among the author’s contributions are the naming of names. Television is the Deep State’s voice, and I am immediately reminded of Fareed Zakaria, the most elegant whore of the Deep State on the air today.
Included in this chapter is a most interesting section suggesting that Wikileaks is an intelligence operation that has received the directed support of TIME Magazine and the media outlets under the control of Robert Murdoch, whose own public relations person is on the board of Wikileaks. One does wonder.
Also in this chapter is a segment on language as the cornerstone of independence and the observation that languages created nations, not the other way around.
The chapter concludes most compellingly in suggesting that television as it is used in the USA today is nothing more of less than a Satanic indoctrination program justifying the complete moral collapse of the Republic, and the complete emptying of the public mind of any form of constructive thinking.
The chapter on cybernetics blends CIA MKULTRA mind control with #GoogleGestapo mind control, but I am surprised to find here information about how both contraceptives and Affirmative Action were devised by the Rockefeller and other foundation as very deliberate means of destroying families.
This chapter is helpful in making it clear that globalization and liberalism (anything goes repressive tolerance) are the opposite of nationalism and family values. The line is drawn and I dare say that 2020 is going to be a turning point in American history – either we continue the Trump Revolution and defeat the Deep State and Shadow Government seeking to undermine individual and state sovereignty, or we return to the original program of national debasement and devolution.
Mental health as defined by the authorities is totally centered on obedience and credulity to lies.
UNESCO and most medicine including vaccines is about eugenics – population control to the point of genocide and the deliberate eradication of entire cultures.
The enemy of the Deep State is humanity itself.
The final chapter on “Science Fiction and the Tavistock Institute” is a fitting conclusion to a book that has truly shocked me into thinking more deeply and more urgently about the challenges that face humanity in 2020 and beyond.
I am completely persuaded that saving the family, the community, the individual states and provinces and the larger nation-stations including particularly the United STATES of America (anyone calling for the end of the Electoral College is either an idiot or a traitor), is our millennial challenge.
I am persuaded that my concept for Open Source Everything Engineering (OSEE), including the truth & wisdom channel that cannot be censored in which individuals cannot be digitally assassinated, and the engineering revolution that restores power to the distributed public and ends the ability of banks and lawyers to impoverish the public (while achieving Buckminster Fuller’s concept of ephemeralism, doing more with less), is the other half of the solution (beyond #UNRIG). The human individual, optimized to exercise free will and independent discovery, is the opposite of the fascist corporate top-down controlled economy of, by, and for the Satanic elite. Open, not closed systems, are necessary to enable humanity to achieve its cosmic destiny.
I will end with three reviews I have done that make it clear that the future of humanity depends on localization, not globalization. I believe this strongly and I will spend the rest of my life fighting the Deep State and seeking to empower the individual, the family, the local community, and the sovereign state, in that order. Bottom up, not top down, must be our generative guiding principle.

Fake News Tsunami – Trump's 'Collusion' And Corbyn As 'Dangerous Hero',www.therussophile.org,editor@medialens.org Editor,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/fake-news-tsunami-trumps-collusion-and-corbyn-as-dangerous-hero-2.html/,"This post was originally published on this site
According to corporate journalism, a tidal wave of ‘fake news’ has long been threatening to swamp their wonderful work reporting real news. The ProQuest media database finds fully 805,669 hits for newspaper articles mentioning the term ‘fake news’. The key sources of such fakery are said to be social media, and above all, of course, Russia.
It is a perfect irony, then, that ‘ the Mueller report ‘, conducted by the US Department of Justice Special Counsel’s Office, headed by former FBI Director Robert Mueller, ‘did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities’.
Jeremy Scahill of The Intercept explains the significance:
‘This has been an utterly colossal media failure and it reveals how little things have actually changed with the broader press since the Iraq War lies. The overall tone of much of the reporting on this Trump-Russia story has started from the position that the intelligence community was being truthful about Trump and Russia. The reporting then sought to further confirm those assertions. It was confirmation bias to the nth degree…
‘Also, the fact that Trump is a cartoonish buffoonish villain contributed to an atmosphere where the attitude was that anything Trump was accused of—no matter how insane it sounded—was totally plausible, if not likely, if not certain to have happened. Trump was not supposed to win. It was Hillary Clinton’s turn.’
As we will discuss below, this should ring loud bells with British readers subjected to a very similar smear campaign targeting Jeremy Corbyn, who was also ‘not supposed to win’ the Labour Party election leadership.
In 2017, a Guardian leading article commented on Trump and Russia:
‘The Guardian view of Trump’s Russia links: a lot to go at.’
Another leader in 2017 went much further:
‘Meanwhile the grenades he [Trump] lobs via Twitter or interview cloud the issue that still lies at the heart of his presidency: Russian meddling in the US election, and the possible collusion of his own campaign. All other iniquities pale beside this.’
Also in the Guardian in 2017, columnist Paul Mason highlighted ‘Kremlin involvement in the Trump campaign’ as the key reason ‘Trump could be out of office within a year’.
The Telegraph agreed that the ‘russiagate’ claim ‘is the cloud hanging over the entire presidency’.
The press has been filled with numerous similar examples.
Strongly echoing UK experience, Scahill adds:
‘We have been subjected to more than two years of nonstop, fact-free assertions and wild theories masquerading as fact, masquerading as insightful analysis.’
A tsunami of ‘fake news’, in other words, supplied by the very same media who have supplied that other tsunami of warnings on the threat of ‘fake news’.
The key word, and the title of Guardian journalist Luke Harding’s best-selling book: ‘Collusion’ . The rest of the book title, unfortunately for Harding: ‘How Russia Helped Trump Win the White House’ (Guardian Faber Publishing; Main, 2017).
Harding was also lead author of a fake, front-page Guardian claim in November 2018 that Paul Manafort, Donald Trump’s former campaign manager, had met Julian Assange three times in the Ecuadorian embassy in London. Both Harding and Guardian editor Kath Viner have refused to respond to challenges posed , for example, by former Guardian journalist Glenn Greenwald. Needless to say, our questions were also ignored. Tom Bower’s ‘Farrago Of Falsehood And Insinuation’
As discussed, Scahill’s ‘years of nonstop, fact-free assertions and wild theories masquerading as fact’ also describes UK attacks on Corbyn. In an article for Middle East Eye, journalist Peter Oborne carefully examined a high-profile example supplied by investigative journalist Tom Bower’s book, ‘Dangerous Hero – Corbyn’s Ruthless Plot For Power’ .
The title of Oborne’s piece:
‘Jeremy Corbyn and the truth about Tom Bower’s book – A biography about the Labour leader systematically distorts the truth, writes Peter Oborne.’
By contrast, the Amazon entry for Bower’s book features these impressive comments:
‘THE BOOK EVERY VOTER MUST READ’ Mail on Sunday
‘Meticulous and highly readable … Funny and devastating’ Daily Telegraph
‘The most compelling in-depth study so far’ Guardian
No surprise, then, that the book features in prominent, shop-front and multiple other in-store displays in bookshops like Waterstones and Foyles.
In the Independent, former editor Chris Blackhurst wrote:
‘Reading Tom Bower’s insightful new biography… I was reminded of his [Corbyn’s] isolation and single-mindedness.’
Blackhurst continued:
‘Reading Bower, you’re left in no doubt that Corbyn wants to turn the clock back, that his solution to those problematic examples and awkward developments that upset his path is merely to ignore them. This makes him very dangerous indeed, hard to reason with, oblivious to criticism and set in his ways. It’s a troubling account, one that should give every entrepreneur pause and anyone who works in business pause.’
Writing in the Telegraph, Tom Harris gave four out of five stars to Bower’s ‘devastating account of Corbyn’s rise to the top’. Harris wrote:
‘Bower’s meticulous and highly readable account must be absorbed from start to finish’ [and was] ‘Funny and devastating’.
In the Sunday Times, Dominic Sandbrook, praised ‘a forensically detailed portrait of a man with no inner life, a monomaniac suffused with an overwhelming sense of his own righteousness…’
ProQuest finds no less than 22 hits for articles mentioning Bower and his book in the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday. In the latter, historian Andrew Roberts welcomed the paper’s ‘serialisation of Tom Bower’s searing biography of Corbyn’. Roberts wrote:
‘Today’s extract from Bower’s book charts how anti-Zionism became a near-obsession for Corbyn since his early days as a trades union researcher, leading him to believe in what Bower describes as “the malign collective power of Jews”.’
The book ‘made clear’ that Corbyn ‘has adopted a Leninist blueprint for taking and controlling power at Westminster, while playing the “nice guy”.’
Oborne, on the other hand, took such a dim view of the book that he felt obliged to remind readers of the whole ethical basis of political journalism:
‘Those of us who report on politics are at liberty to express, within limits, whatever opinions we like. These limits include an obligation to observe standards. We should strive to be accurate. We can make strong arguments but ought not to distort the truth or suppress relevant information to make our point.
‘Writer Tom Bower fails catastrophically to meet these standards. It is not only that Dangerous Hero: Corbyn’s Ruthless Plot For Power , his new book on Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, contains numerous falsehoods. It systematically omits relevant facts in order to portray Corbyn as a ruthless Marxist and anti-semite hell-bent on destroying Western liberal values.’
Oborne continued:
‘The ugly truth is that Bower is not straight with his readers, let alone Corbyn.
‘Again and again he withholds relevant information, with the result that the Labour leader and his colleagues come over in the worst possible light.’
Oborne provided numerous examples in his long, careful analysis. For example:
‘Bower makes much of a confrontation between Labour activist Marc Wadsworth and Labour MP Ruth Smeeth at the launch for Shami Chakrabarti’s report on anti-semitism in June 2016. He writes that “Wadsworth snapped at her that not only was she ‘working hand-in-hand’ with the right-wing media by speaking to the journalist, but she was also a Jew”.
‘The brief incident is recorded on video. I have examined this video. Nowhere in the footage does Wadsworth say that Smeeth is Jewish. I spoke to two eyewitnesses to this event, both of whom confirmed to me that at no point did Wadsworth say that Smeeth was Jewish.’
Bower’s book contains a really extraordinary claim against Corbyn’s press officer, former Guardian comment editor Seumas Milne, describing his behaviour after the arrival of members of the Board of Deputies of British Jews in Corbyn’s office:
‘In the presence of Jews, his body language had visibly changed.’
Oborne noted that no evidence or source was provided to justify this accusation, which depicts Milne as an authentically Nazi-style Jew-hater. Oborne responded, to devastating effect, citing journalist David Hearst:
“‘I sat for a number of years opposite Seumas,’ he told me. ‘I am Jewish, as are a number of my former colleagues on The Guardian. At no time did any of us sense that Seumas’s body language changed in our presence.
“‘He was part of the team, held in high regard for his knowledge of the Middle East and often consulted on it, particularly by the person who sat next to him, fellow columnist Jonathan Freedland. That opinion of Seumas was shared by our editor at the time, Alan Rusbridger, who kept him as comment editor for six years.'”
Bower’s response to Oborne’s critique?
‘During the last 36 hours, I have made numerous attempts to make contact with Tom Bower in order to give him the chance to defend himself. I’ve contacted him by mobile phone, by text message and at his direct line at his London home. No answer. I also emailed a list of questions to Bower yesterday morning, both to his private email address and to his publicist at William Collins. He has not responded to me.’
Oborne has since told us that Bower never responded to his questions (Twitter, direct message, March 28). He continued:
‘Bower has made an astonishing number of factual errors – more than I have ever come across in a book from a mainstream publisher. While something has clearly gone horribly wrong with the editing process at William Collins, Bower is the author and must take full responsibility…
‘Time after time, Bower makes assertions that are not backed by any evidence. The problem is so bad that I resolved to carry out my own investigation into the truth of some of the assertions made in Bower’s book. This article is the result of my research. Again and again, I have been able to prove that his account of events is false, misleading and, in some cases, pure fabrication.’
Oborne added:
‘Bower’s book is not just intellectually dishonest, it is a farrago of falsehood and insinuation.
‘Yet it appears to have had no difficulty finding a mainstream publisher, while receiving a generous reception in the mainstream press. To their credit a handful of reviewers – above all Stephen Bush in the Observer – have exposed some of the errors in this book. But even the Bush review hardly touches on the extent of the collapse of journalistic standards in Bower’s account of Corbyn.’
To his credit, the Guardian’s George Monbiot tweeted Oborne’s piece with high praise:
‘A brave and remarkable review’
A tweeter countered, noting that ‘similar nonsense comes from Guardian on a daily basis without regard to balance or fact’.
Monbiot replied :
‘Both the Guardian and the Observer slated the book.’
In fact, Guardian columnist and former political editor of the Observer, Gaby Hinsliff, concluded of Bower’s book in the Guardian:
‘This is the most compelling in-depth study so far of a man whose head is unusually difficult to get inside, given his suspicion of anyone who isn’t a fellow traveller. Just don’t expect it to change anyone’s mind.’
It is telling to compare Hinsliff’s most severe criticism with Oborne’s:
‘And that’s perhaps the biggest flaw in an otherwise damning book. Bower’s colours seem nailed to the mast…’
As Oborne says:
‘British journalists need to ask themselves a question. Is there something rotten in British media discourse which allows someone like Bower to get away with this?’
It is an important question. Celebrating ‘a farrago of falsehood’ titled ‘Dangerous Hero’ can have dangerous consequences. Last month, Corbyn was punched in the head by a protestor holding an egg (dismissed as an ‘egging’ by journalists) who was subsequently jailed for 28 days for the attack. This week, we learned that soldiers of the 3rd Battalion of the British Paratroop Regiment filmed themselves shooting at a picture of Corbyn.
This recalls the revelation, in 2015, that a senior serving general had warned that a government led by Corbyn could face ‘a mutiny’ from the army. The unnamed general told the Sunday Times:
‘The Army just wouldn’t stand for it. The general staff would not allow a prime minister to jeopardise the security of this country and I think people would use whatever means possible, fair or foul to prevent that. You can’t put a maverick in charge of a country’s security.’
Political and press criticism of Corbyn has always far exceeded the usual fierce disagreement, presenting him as a treacherous threat to national security, an anti-semitic fool who is ‘unfit’ to lead the country. He has been relentlessly presented as fundamentally unacceptable. As this alert was being written, Conservative MP Caroline Johnson warned in parliament that mismanaging Brexit risked ‘letting down the country and ushering in a Marxist, anti-semite-led government’. It is, in fact, astonishing to see how, in less than four years, politicians and journalists have turned an honest, compassionate, decent politician into a hate figure.
If ‘acceptable’ political choices are ultimately determined by the media, the government, or even by the military, we are well on the way to fascism.

The Bankrupt American Idiocracy Headed Toward Chaos After Petrodollar Collapse,www.therussophile.org,State of the Nation,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/the-bankrupt-american-idiocracy-headed-toward-chaos-after-petrodollar-collapse.html/,"This post was originally published on this site
by Paul Craig Roberts
Since 2016 the United States has been in the Russiagate box, a hoax created by the US military/security complex to prevent President Trump from normalizing relations with Russia. Normalized relations would devalue THE RUSSIAN THREAT, an orchestration that protects the $1,000 billion annual budget of the military/security complex.
The Democratic Party, which most certainly is not democratic, supported the hoax hoping to do Trump in for their own reasons and pulled the presstitute media into the conspiracy against Trump.
Now that all the assurances from the Establishment that Trump was a traitor to America who conspired with Russian President Putin to steal the election from the killer-bitch in order that America could serve Russian interests have been exposed as lies by the Mueller report, American attention is free to take up some other nonsensical campaign. The succession of these stupidities is destroying America’s reputation.
True, some of the most crazed of the Democrats and media whores cannot let go of Russiagate. The presstitutes are saying that Trump would be impeached for his non-crime except the unworthy Democrats had rather go back to the business of spending other people’s money. A crazed professor or two have declared that Mueller was part of the “Trump coverup” and that Mueller needs to be investigated. But these claims simply underline that the United States wasted three years of its existence.
Meanwhile, other countries moved on.
The Russians, for example, discovered that Washington’s sanctions had a silver lining. Russia became more self-sufficient economically and moved out of the box of being an exporter of raw materials to the West, a box into which the Americans and the American-brainwashed Russian economics profession had put the Russian government.
The fulminations and threats from Washington against Russia brought forth new Russian weapon systems for which the US has no match or defense, weapons that demote the US to a second-rate military power.
On an adjusted basis, China now has the world’s largest economy and increasingly ignores Washington’s blustering. As does Iran.
Even Venezuela stands up to Washington.
The world is concluding that Washington is not the power it thinks it is.
Washington’s abuse of its reserve currency role and violations of international law have encouraged a movement away from the use of the dollar in international transactions. This is perhaps even a more serious threat to Washington’s power than Russia’s superior military capabilities.
President Franklin D. Roosevelt was happy to see World War II because he understood that it would leave Britain bankrupt and without an empire. Roosevelt understood that the gain would be America’s, because the US would take over the reserve currency role. The reason this is important is that the reserve currency country can pay its bills by printing money. Thus, the government has no budget constraints.
For a country as indebted as America, to lose this role would be a crushing blow. It is this blow that Washington faces as a result of its idiotic policy of sanctions and disrespect of international law.
And there is another blow. Just as the Roman Empire fell to invaders who crossed the frontiers of the empire, so is Washington’s empire falling. Europe, the crown jewel of the empire, is now overrun with millions of unassimilable peoples to the extent that Europe is no longer European. The President of the US has so far been powerless to defend the borders of the United States. Indeed, the Democratic Party and the presstitute media are totally opposed to any defense of American borders. Why does a government unwilling to defend its borders spend $1,000 billion annually on defense?
The American Neoconservative Zionists, who have controlled US foreign policy in Israel’s interest since the Clinton regime, continue to operate as if we still live in an unipolar world. For some reason the National Security Advisor to President Trump has poor sources of information. He speaks as if he rules the world, but even Washington’s pathetic European vassals did not go along with Trump’s gift of the Syrian Golan Heights to Israel.
As for moral authority, after, Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Yeman, Ukraine, Honduras, and now Venezuela, all moral authority has vacated the West.
Washington is not only losing its economic and military power but also its soft power that rested in Washington’s propaganda about making the world safe for democracy. Democracy is not even safe in the United States as Democrats and the presstitutes have done their best to overturn democracy and to drive the elected president from office, which is precisely what the Trump regime is trying to do to Venezuela.
All of the lies and propaganda that have portrayed the West as God’s gift to humanity have fallen away as the result of Washington’s irresponsible use of power, leaving the West morally naked.
The world no longer thinks that the West is something to look up to and to emulate. Instead, the world sees a great evil, in the words of Matt Taibbi, “a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money.”
A great promise was betrayed by those trusted with the promise. A government accountable to law and to the people requires a united people, not the disunity of multiculturalism and Identity Politics. With the indigenous ethnic base of all of the Western countries under attack as “white supremacists,” the West can no longer defend its culture from the immigrants who do not share the culture.
The tension between an indigenous culture and imported cultures can be seen in the tensions between Hungary and the EU and Italy and the EU. Hungary has refused to accept its quota of non-European immigrants and faces punishment by the EU. In Italy the government is in the hands of a coalition of leftwing and rightwing parties that are united in their opposition to the EU and non-European immigration. In Europe the situation is one in which the EU government, as well as the governments of member states such as France and Germany, have taken the side of immigrants against the indigenous people. In other words, the governments of Europe are not committed to their own cultures. This is the unmistakable sign of a dead culture.
In the United States there is so much disunity that to call the states united is a misuse of words . Hillary voters hate Trump voters, and vice versa. The presstitute media and universities are uniformly anti-white.
Countries without unity are not strong. Consequently, the Western world is losing its leadership of the world.
Of course, the rest of the world also suffers from disunity. The Sunni and the Shiites cannot unite, with the consequence that the Muslim world is weak. The tribes in Africa cannot unite. India and Pakistan stay at each other’s throats. Animosities exist among Asians. Russia herself is a federation. China has a Muslim province. But the disunities are different from those in the West. Japan and China have differences but the population of Japan is homogeneous and China largely is. Arabs are Arabs whether Sunni or Shiite. The Russian Federation is the remains of an old empire, largely assimilated, not the result of recent immigrations.
The consequence of disunity perhaps precludes any leadership. But the collapse of the West into diversity and multiculturalism definitely means that Western leadership has been lost to the weakness of disunity.
Is it chaos that awaits?

Julian Assange Soon to be Arrested After Expulsion by Ecuadorian Embassy,www.therussophile.org,State of the Nation,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/julian-assange-soon-to-be-arrested-after-expulsion-by-ecuadorian-embassy.html/,"This post was originally published on this site Assange Arrest Imminent: Ecuadorian Embassy To Expel Him In “Hours To Days”

WikiLeaks has published an urgent statement to its official social media accounts, saying the Ecuadorian embassy in London is preparing to expel Julian Assange within “hours to days,” citing two “high level” Ecuadorian sources, and that the South American country “already has an agreement with the UK for his arrest.”
The statement published Thursday night grabbed headlines in US and UK press, with WikiLeaks supporters calling on crowds to gather outside the embassy in solidarity with Assange.
WikiLeaks said via Twitter, A high level source within the Ecuadorian state has told WikiLeaks that Julian Assange will be expelled within “hours to days” using the INA Papers offshore scandal as a pretext — and that it already has an agreement with the UK for his arrest.

The corruption scandal WikiLeaks referenced involves WikiLeaks’ reporting on papers alleging that Ecuadorian president Lenín Moreno enriched himself from an offshore account in Panama — allegations which Moreno has vehemently denied.
For his part, Moreno has ramped up pressure and scrutiny on Assange this week, saying in a radio interview that the whistleblower and journalist has egregiously and repeatedly violated the terms of his asylum .
Moreno went so far as to indirectly suggest Assange and WikiLeaks leaked personal photos of him and his family online, but without directly referencing him by name.

WikiLeaks says Moreno is attempting to generate a “false pretext” and publicly justifiable excuse on the back of the INA Papers scandal for ending Assange’s asylum on the legal technicality that “conditions” have been broken.

Reign of the Almighty Dollar Threatened as Petrodollar Crashes and Burns,www.therussophile.org,State of the Nation,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/reign-of-the-almighty-dollar-threatened-as-petrodollar-crashes-and-burns.html/,"This post was originally published on this site Saudis Threaten To Ditch Petrodollar As “Nuclear Option” To Block NOPEC Bill
ZeroHedge.com
Three year ago – almost to the day – Saudi Arabia rattled its first sabre towards the United States, with an implicit threat to dump US Treasuries over Congress’ decision to allow the Saudis to be held responsible for the 9/11 attacks.
In a stunning report at the time by the NYTimes , Saudi Arabia told the Obama administration and members of Congress that it will sell off hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth of American assets held by the kingdom if Congress passes a bill that would allow the Saudi government to be held responsible in American courts for any role in the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.
Then, six months ago , the Saudis once again threatened to weaponize their wealth as the biggest importer of arms from America in the world.
You will find more infographics at Statista
And now , Reuters reports, citing three unidentified people familiar with Saudi energy policy, Saudi Arabia is threatening to drop the dollar as its main currency in selling its oil if the U.S. passes a bill that exposes OPEC members to U.S. antitrust lawsuits .
While the death of the petrodollar has long been predicted (as the petroyuan gathers momentum), this is the most direct threat yet to the USDollar’s exorbitant privilege…
“The Saudis know they have the dollar as the nuclear option,” one of the sources familiar with the matter said.
“The Saudis say: let the Americans pass NOPEC and it would be the U.S. economy that would fall apart,” another source said.
Riyadh reportedly communicated the threat to senior U.S. energy officials , one person briefed on Saudi oil policy told Reuters
As Reuters details, NOPEC, or the No Oil Producing and Exporting Cartels Act, was first introduced in 2000 and aims to remove sovereign immunity from U.S. antitrust law, paving the way for OPEC states to be sued for curbing output in a bid to raise oil prices.
While the bill has never made it into law despite numerous attempts, the legislation has gained momentum since U.S. President Donald Trump came to office. Trump said he backed NOPEC in a book published in 2011 before he was elected, though he not has not voiced support for NOPEC as president.
Trump has instead stressed the importance of U.S-Saudi relations, including sales of U.S. military equipment, even after the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi last year.
A move by Saudi Arabia to ditch the dollar would resonate well with big non-OPEC oil producers such as Russia as well as major consumers China and the European Union, which have been calling for moves to diversify global trade away from the dollar to dilute U.S. influence over the world economy.
Russia, which is subject to U.S. sanctions, has tried to sell oil in euros and China’s yuan but the proportion of its sales in those currencies is not significant.
Venezuela and Iran, which are also under U.S. sanctions, sell most of their oil in other currencies but they have done little to challenge the dollar’s hegemony in the oil market.
However, if a long-standing U.S. ally such as Saudi Arabia joined the club of non-dollar oil sellers it would be a far more significant move likely to gain traction within the industry.
Perhaps this explains why Russia has been dumping dollars in favors of gold in recent months …
And why China suddenly admitted to increased gold reserves…
And why there has been a spike in yuan buying by reserve managers last year, as the IMF pointed out in a recent report.
So the next time you hear an analyst on CNBC categorically dismiss the notion that the loss of the dollar’s reserve currency status isn’t something that markets should take seriously (even as several credible voices have warned that it should be), you’d do well to remember this chart.
Nothing lasts forever."

via breitbart :
DACA illegal immigrants should be hired to help prepare laws for 330 million Americans, according to a draft bill introduced by Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) and 20 other Democratic senators.
“The giant sign outside my office says ‘DREAMers Welcome Here’ because we know and value the contributions that these young people have made to their communities,” the California senator said in a Wednesday statement about the DACA job offer. She continued :
But right now, those same young people are banned from giving back to their country by working for Congress. That has to change … Government works best when it reflects the people it represents. Our nation’s DREAMers are some of our best and brightest, and it’s time they had the opportunity to get a job or paid internship on Capitol Hill.
“The American Dream Employment Act would expand Congress’ talent pool, give Dreamers a seat at the table, and strengthen policymaking for all Americans,” said Nevada Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto.
“I’ve been proud to have several Dreamers work in my office as volunteer interns and have seen firsthand how the people of Illinois would benefit if Dreamers could serve as paid employees in my office,” said Illinois Democrat Sen. Dick Durbin.
The jobs and status giveaway to DACA illegal immigrants is linked to Harris’s high-profile run for the presidency.
“Kamala Harris is going all in on immigration reform,” said a pro-Harris article in Politico, which also highlighted the claim by open-borders advocates that federal immigration law is “a mean-spirited ban on Dreamers.” The article continued:
It’s the latest move by the California Democrat to seize on an issue that her rival Beto O’Rourke has made his calling card — and to advocate for a Democratic constituency that’s often reduced to a congressional bargaining chip.
Harris is also pushing legislation that would dramatically expand the legal and financial incentives for hundreds of thousands of Indian low-wage college graduates to take U.S.-based jobs from U.S. college graduates. Harris’s mother is from India. Weird but true: GOP and Dems in Congress are offering fast-track green cards to encourage 300,000+ vr. low wage Indian workers to take jobs from middle class American voters & graduates. FWIW I don’t think the pols & staffers recognize what they are doing t.co/4TIUFzhC9b

“The governments of Venezuela and Russia, within the framework of the 14 High Level Intergovernmental Commission, expand agricultural cooperation agreements to increase production in the country,” the minister wrote on his Twitter account.
He specified in this context that some of the most evaluated topics are “inputs and fertilizers, genetic improvement, agrochemicals for sowing of cereals, acquisition of seeds not produced in Venezuela and agricultural mechanization.”
Venezuelan Vice-President and Planning Minister Ricardo Menéndez published on his social network account that, on Wednesday, the “working meeting of the teams based on the strategic relationship, sovereignty and respect for a multipolar world.”

The Minister of Foreign Trade and International Investment, Yomana Koteich, will attend the meeting of the joint committee, in addition to Menéndez and Castro Soteldo.
This comes as Russia announced it does not intend to create a “second Syria” in Venezuela, said the Russian MRE minister, Sergei Lavrov, noting that the Russian military, which is in the Caribbean country, has the sole goal of providing technical maintenance to military equipment.
“No, we have not tried it at all, we have publicly announced it and we have nothing to hide,” the minister told the newspaper Moskovsky Komsomolets , referring to allegations of attempts to create a “second Syria” in Venezuela.
“There is an agreement, which was signed with Hugo Chavez in 2001. It [the agreement] has been ratified by the national parliament, it is completely legal and corresponds to all the requirements of the Constitution of Venezuela. Venezuela’s technical-military goods need maintenance, and now the time has come to provide a further technical maintenance,” said the Russian minister.
Earlier, the Russian minister explained that Russian military experts are in Venezuela legally to participate in the maintenance of Russian military equipment previously supplied to the Caribbean country.

The Anti-Semitic Con,www.therussophile.org,Paul Edwards,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/the-anti-semitic-con.html/,"This post was originally published on this site
With the Putin/Russia Collusion Fairytale debunked, the undeniable cancer of real foreign interference in our government demands an honest airing.
Since American politics is mortally corrupt, one might wonder why bother to expose one prime cause of its ethical degeneracy. If the beast is dead, what use is determining what killed it? Well, it isn’t quite dead and we have to live with it. If the public knew one country has done more to subvert our government than all others combined it might raise enough hell to stop it.
In terms of influence, there can be no serious denial that Israel exerts by far the most powerful suasion of any foreign power on America. Influence exerted by a foreign power’s registered lobby is legitimate per our toothless protocol. Israel’s is not so registered, but… details, details. So, when Republicans invite Bibi to smarmily insult a sitting President in a joint session of Congress, that’s influence, not interference. When, besides financing most Senators and Representatives elections, Israel takes them on cushy, free PR junkets to Tel Aviv, that’s influence, not interference.
Conversely, when Clintonista subversion of the Sanders campaign appears on Wikileaks and is instantly imputed to Russia and Putin–without proof and against expert technical evidence–that’s not influence, it’s Russki interference. More absurdly, when–again, without proof–the same Dem CFOs howl that Putin Trolls bought chump change worth of dingy ads on Facebook that swung the election to Trump that’s… but you get the picture.
What is obvious and has long been so–and has been emphasized by two years of fraud and insanity regarding imagined Russian collusion–is that influence is what your friends have; interference is what your enemies do.
Why, when it is so blatantly obvious as to be a source of outspoken pride for them, is the fact that Israel’s right-wing ruling clique brazenly and continually interferes in American government in the most aggressive and offensive way, universally denied? You want flagrant foreign collusion with high officials in U.S. government? Open your eyes. And your mind…
The reason it’s officially denied is that Israel’s Congressional whores know that not to do so violates their deal. Not to back Israel unquestioningly terminates it, and the loss of that money means loss of office… to say nothing of the beating they’d take in the press and on their reputations.
The great mass of Americans won’t admit what many can’t help but know because they, too, fear being attacked for such bold honesty. They are equally vulnerable to rough handling from the same source: the massively powerful Israel Lobby, a unified phalanx of militant American Zionists.
To be clear: Zionism has always insisted that Israel exists for Jews only.
The Israel Lobby–financed by vast American Zionist wealth–potent as it is, could not leverage our politics if its tactics were exposed, and it knows it. History gives it the key that makes rational assessment of Israel’s policies impossible: the Holocaust and the true anti-Semitism that was its cause.
Evocation of that horror allows any critique of Israeli government to be sleazily labelled Anti-Semitism, and so to effectively nullify argument. The dishonest and cynical Israel Lobby uses this tactic shamelessly to blunt and derail sound criticism or even plain examination of Israeli state behavior.
What then is Anti-Semitism? By definition it is antipathy or hatred of the Jewish people as a whole . An Anti-Semite espouses that categorical prejudice, and Anti-Semitism in word or deed pertains to Jews in toto . In contrast, behavior that is ugly, hateful, or injurious but not directed at Jews as a whole, though execrable, is not Anti-Semitic, just as it’s possible to hate a Catholic or Muslim without hating their religion or their people.
It follows then, that criticism, even vicious, hateful criticism of the Israeli State, is not inherently Anti-Semitic, and the claim is false on its face. To attack the Israeli State is not to attack Jews as a people since Israel is not home to most of Jewry and its polity by no means defines or represents Jews in all their broad, complex range of beliefs, practices, and principles.
To say that criticizing the brutal, repressive apartheid Israeli government’s actions is Anti-Semitic is no more legitimate than to say that condemnation of the American State’s vicious imperialist wars makes one anti-American.
This disingenuous con needs to named and refuted around the world.
Is there criticism of Israel that is clearly Anti-Semitic? Of course, there is! Plenty of it. Anti-Semitism is no less real and evil because it does not apply to all critiques of Israel or all insults to Jews or Jewish entities. Precisely because Anti-Semitism is so vile and toxic a disease, and because it will continue to live in its odious carriers, it is critically important not to vitiate the ubiquitous contempt it arouses by cynically muddling its meaning.
The dishonest and defensive crying of wolf that the government of Israel and the Israel Lobby deploy against any criticism of their history and policy is, in addition to being morally contemptible, deeply counterproductive in terms of Israel’s standing in world opinion. Mounting a transparently false, blanket, all-purpose lament as a cover for their most obvious and glaring crimes and cruelties cannot prevent the world from seeing them for the corrupt and unjust power they are and fiercely, adamantly opposing them.
Beyond the damage Israel’s cowardly dishonesty does to itself, a more critical concern for Americans concerns what it has done and is doing to exacerbate the rolling debacle of our misruled and floundering country. The Israel Lobby, Zionism’s American voice, wielding the bogus trope of Anti-Semitism as a club, infects and pollutes through its agents and activists every niche of our government from the Presidency and Congress, to Federal Departments and Bureaus, to State and local offices.
Without Zionist acceptance Trump would not have been President, but neither would Obama. Through the Lobby’s diligence we have made our country hated by carrying Israel’s dirty water in the Middle East, crippled and hamstrung enlightened policy at home, and been afflicted with such creatures of nightmare as the Harpy, Nikki Haley, bughouse pseudo-Christian loon, Mike Pompeo, and murderous psychopath, John Bolton.
Nothing suggests the death grip Israel and its Lobby have on our fate can be broken. So long as the Anti-Semitic Con is viable, even our security is in jeopardy with its blind, sick, demented chosen monsters in charge.
The fable of the eagle and scorpion comes painfully to mind. When the bird, stung and bearing them both down to death, asks how the scorpion could sting it after swearing not to do so, it replies, “You knew what I was when you let me ride.” It was all too clear what Israel was in 1947.

"Pity About No Collusion, But They’ve Still Got the Cold War to Heat Up",www.therussophile.org,Brian Cloughley,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/pity-about-no-collusion-but-theyve-still-got-the-cold-war-to-heat-up.html/,"This post was originally published on this site
Donald Trump is a narcissistic boor who tells lies with a casual indifference that might be regarded with amusement (“My father is German, was German, born in a very wonderful place in Germany”) were he not a malevolent poseur with all the style and attraction of a sock full of wet spaghetti. He is a spiteful mendacious buffoon whose views and actions on international and domestic affairs are confused, erratic and dangerous.
BUT — for once he has been proved to have been right, because he told the truth when he stoutly denied he had colluded with sinister Russians to ensure he would win the presidential election in 2016. A two-year inquiry was conducted by Special Counsel Robert Mueller at a cost of 25 million dollars for the first eighteen months and on 24 March the New York Times reported that “Mr Mueller and his team were unable to establish that anyone connected to the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government” in the course of the 2016 elections.
The Times noted that Mr Mueller “is as careful and thorough an investigator as there is. His investigation lasted almost two years, issued more than 2,800 subpoenas and roughly 500 search warrants and heard from a similar number of witnesses. If he couldn’t find any links, it’s doubtful anyone could.”
But the paper couldn’t avoid highlighting the totally unproved allegation that Russia had “interfered to help Mr. Trump in the 2016 presidential campaign” although the grudging admission that there was no collusion was a step in the right direction.
What was expected by those of us ingenuous to imagine there might be honor in the mainstream media and Congress was that those responsible for feeding the fires of hatred over the years, and those who stated explicitly, for example, that there was “plenty of evidence of collusion or conspiracy in plain sight” should stand up and say, quite clearly, “Sorry. We were wrong.”
I also believe in the tooth fairy and the Easter Bunny.
This “plain sight” allegation was by Congressman Adam Schiff, reported in August 2018. He is Chair of the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence of the House of Representatives and repeatedly said that his committee had uncovered “plenty of evidence of collusion or conspiracy.” He told ‘Meet the Press’ two years ago that “I can’t go into the particulars, but there is more than circumstantial evidence now” and in an ABC interview declared that the collusion conspiracy was of “a size and scope probably beyond Watergate.” He was retailing deceptive garbage, but there are plenty more like him, and their rabble-rousing declarations were devotedly recorded without question by most of the media.
The Washington Post now greatly regrets “the toxic tribalism that’s been tearing apart the country’s civic culture” but it was the Post and all the rest of the mainstream media that encouraged tribalism, factionalism, distrust and hatred — exactly as so many of the extremist promoters of Brexit have done in the now totally disUnited Kingdom, which is about to plunge to economic and social disaster. But the Post , a major Russia-baiter, must be given credit for publishing an article on 28 March by Marc Thiessen, saying among other things that there are “a lot of people in Washington with a lot of explaining to do.” That said, it is unlikely that many of us will hold any breath waiting for explanation of their campaign of vindictive malice.
Freddy Gray of the US Spectator noted that on 25 March, just before release of the Mueller findings, 2020 presidential candidate Beto O’Rourke said “You have a president who, in my opinion, beyond a shadow of a doubt, sought to, however ham-handedly, collude with the Russian government.” But he won’t be held to account. It is highly unlikely that one single intending voter for O’Rourke will have a opinion-alteration simply because the candidate made an utter fool of himself and deliberately misled the American people.
Former CIA Director John Brennan, a media favorite during the happy collusion years, declared Trump to be “wholly in the pocket of Putin” and wrote that “Trump’s claims of no collusion are, in a word, hogwash.”
It’s reminiscent of the horrible days of the unlamented alcoholic Senator Joseph McCarthy who in the 1950s destroyed the lives of so many innocent people because he wanted to achieve political prominence. In a speech he announced categorically that “I have here in my hand a list of 205 [members of the State Department] that were known to the Secretary of State as being members of the Communist Party and who nevertheless are still working and shaping the policy of the State Department.” In later pronouncements he gave different numbers and generally contradicted himself — but it didn’t matter. As with the Trump-Russia “collusion” allegations, those who wanted to believe there were thousands of sinister conspiring communists in the State Department, and Hollywood and Voice of America Radio, as stated clearly by McCarthy, simply carried on believing everything McCarthy said, even to this day .
They are in similar company, because there are millions of people out there who refuse to be convinced that there was no collusion , no matter what evidence is produced to refute their mistaken conviction.
Not only this, but the Cold War campaign against Russia is heating up, with the media trying very hard to deflect attention from their embarrassment about being totally wrong. The New York Times , for example, came up with the devious tactic of attack by means of an anti-Russia major article on 31 March. This piece announced with horror that “Russia’s Military Mission Creep Advances to a New Front: Africa.” In shocked tones it revealed that “Russia, entrenched in Africa during the Cold War’s violent East-West rivalry, largely retreated from the continent after the collapse of the Soviet Union. But in the past two years, Moscow has rekindled relations with Soviet-era clients like Mozambique and Angola, and forged new ties with other countries. President Vladimir Putin of Russia will host a summit meeting between Moscow and African countries later this year.” They’re obviously going to collude about something.
The Times had the effrontery to claim that the Pentagon “has a relatively light footprint across Africa” — with 6000 troops and a thousand military mercenaries (‘contractors’ in Newspeak) in the continent — but failed to state, as Nick Turse notes , that “a recent investigation by the Intercept , based on documents obtained from US Africa Command (AFRICOM) via the Freedom of Information Act, revealed a network of 34 bases heavily clustered in the north and west of that continent as well as in the Horn of Africa. AFRICOM’s ‘strategic posture’ consists of larger ‘enduring’ outposts, including two forward operating sites, 12 cooperative security locations, and 20 more austere sites known as contingency locations.”
In other words, Washington’s Defence-Industrial Complex has spread its military tentacles well and truly (and potentially disastrously) over Africa, but the mainstream media, and especially the New York Times, prefer to highlight the Russia’s modest but effective cooperation with African countries in an effort to further demonize Moscow, while drawing readers away from the important but increasingly downplayed revelation that THERE WAS NO COLLUSION.
One of the more fatuous reactions to the Mueller findings was that of the Post’s media columnist, Martha Sullivan, who made an attempt to help reporters and commentators out of the disgusting mess they helped to create by writing a piece titled “Serious journalists should be proud of — not bullied over — their Russia reporting.” Once readers of that ludicrous headline stopped laughing they were regaled with the argument that the hacks “drove forward a national conversation that needed to happen. As Americans saw with their own eyes Trump’s bizarre efforts to ingratiate himself with Russian President Vladimir Putin, that reporting mattered and provided context.” Sure. Even if the reporting was total baloney.
The defenses are up, while the excuses are being trotted out and counter-attacks are gaining momentum. It’s just like old times, when the Cold War was thriving. And Washington’s powerful anti-Russia lobby is delighted that Cold War Two is heating up.
A version of this piece appeared in Strategic Culture Foundation on April 2 .
