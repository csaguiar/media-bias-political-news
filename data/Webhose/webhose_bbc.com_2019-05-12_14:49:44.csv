Notre-Dame fire: How will the cathedral be restored? - BBC News,www.bbc.com,Gareth Evans Bbc News,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-47952055,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Hundreds of millions of euros have been pledged to help rebuild Notre-Dame The dramatic sight of Notre-Dame being ravaged by flames on Monday captivated people around the world.
The French cathedral, which dates back more than 850 years, has been partially destroyed despite the best efforts of firefighters who worked throughout the night.
Now, as investigators work to establish the cause of the blaze, attention has turned to how the building can be repaired.
A number of companies and business tycoons have pledged hundreds of millions of euros between them towards the restoration effort.
So can the famous landmark be returned to its former glory?
John David is better positioned than most to judge whether the famous cathedral can be saved.
The master stonemason was part of a team of craftsmen who worked to rebuild England's York Minster cathedral when it was badly damaged by fire in 1984. It was set alight after it was hit by lightning, causing Â£2.25m ($3m) in damage.
""We went in and there were piles of charred timbers on the floor,"" he recalls. ""There was black ash and soot and the whole building smelt of smoke. There was a sort of gloom in the place.""
But he says the team was confident it could be repaired and he feels equally optimistic about Notre-Dame. ""There was no fear about putting it back and I imagine that's the same in this case"" he says.
""It's quite achievable to see it [restored] and it's an opportunity to show that this work can still be done,"" he says.
Image caption John David helped repair York Minster after it was hit by a lightning strike in 1984 Mr David says the restoration team must first remove the Notre-Dame's burnt scaffolding. There were extensive renovation works taking place at the time of the fire and a huge scaffold was covering much of its exterior.
""The scaffolding will be in the way and will have to be delicately taken down because it's suffered with the heat,"" he says.
He explains that a protective cover will then need to be placed over the cathedral to shield it from the wind and rain.
Any fallen timber and other debris inside the cathedral will need to be cleared out, Mr David says. But this debris won't just be removed and forgotten about.
""Early phases of the work will include the archaeological recording of surviving fragments of timber, stone and artworks,"" says Dr Kate Giles, from the University of York's department of archaeology.
""This will enable the Notre-Dame team to salvage what can be reused and provide crucial evidence for the design of new fabrics in the building,"" she says.

""Safety will be the prime concern,"" says Dr Amira Elnokaly, a lecturer in archaeology at the University of Lincoln. ""There should be critical inspections to avoid any risks of further collapses or falling debris.""
The survey will then turn to the stonework at the top of the cathedral near the roof.
""The upper stone work, the vaulting and the top windows, will have been baked and the temperature will have spoiled and weakened the stone,"" says Paul Binski, a history of medieval art professor at the University of Cambridge.
""The first thing they're going to do is a massive survey of the stone,"" he says. ""They're going to have to scaffold the whole building and look very closely at its condition.""
Image copyright AFP Image caption A view of the stone ceiling inside the Notre-Dame before the fire This is because the stone ceiling will have taken the brunt of the impact when the timber roof above collapsed, experts suggest.
""The 19th Century spire, the 19th Century roofing, what will have happened is that these will have crashed down on to the stone vault underneath, the rib vault, which rises to 108ft (33m),"" Prof Binski says.
""The vaulting system will have shielded what's in the church from the inferno above,"" he adds. ""Of course, it will likely have come down in parts, but it will have done a major protective job.""
Indeed, images appear to show that the pulpit, pews and altar have escaped the fire largely unscathed.
If some of the stonework does need to be replaced then, Prof Binski says, the team will probably use traditional methods to do so.
""It's important to look at the original construction methods and try to emulate them."" he explains. ""This involves building an awful lot of wood scaffolding inside the church because [stone vaulting] is built around a kind of wooden structure - like a mould.
""They're not built with cement but with something that's rather like putty.""
Prof Binski says that if a large amount of the stone vaulting needs to be replaced it could be ""the biggest vaulting operation of this type undertaken since the Middle Ages"".
""The question is how long this is going to take and my guess is 5-10 years minimum to get the whole thing re-vaulted,"" he says.
This estimate highlights the challenges facing the restoration team if they are to meet President Emmanuel Macron's suggested timescale. The French leader wants Notre-Dame rebuilt by the time Paris hosts the Summer Olympics in 2024.
But Mr David says this is a feasible goal. ""I don't think it will take 10 years,"" he says. ""It might take two years to decide what to do, but [five years] is quite achievable.""
The moment the spire fell The story of the fire in graphics Why blaze was difficult to tackle Photos from inside the cathedral appear to show that at least one of its famed rose windows has survived, although there are concerns for some of the other stained-glass windows.
So how will the experts protect and restore these?
""They will do an initial survey when they establish what the highest priorities are in terms of historical and artistic significance,"" says Sarah Brown, an expert in stained glass windows.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption At least one of the three famous rose windows is reported to have survived the fire ""I suspect all of the windows will require some attention because a fire of that size will generate so much smoke and soot,"" she says. ""Even if the windows are in relatively good order they're certainly going to require cleaning.
""The biggest problem will be the heating up and then the rapid cooling down of the glass as it's been struck by water from the cannons,"" Ms Brown explains. ""This will bring about thermal shock that will cause micro-fractures in the glass which will be really difficult to stabilise.""
She continues: ""They will need to re-lead these windows because the lead that keeps it all together will no longer hold good, but you cannot even attempt that until you've stabilised the heat-induced micro-fractures in the glass.
There are modern adhesives that can do that, however.""
And what if one of the cathedral's windows has been completely destroyed? ""The big question then is how they go about re-glazing the building,"" Ms Brown says.
""You can't leave it with nothing in the window,"" she says. ""Some might call for a new stained glass window but it's too early to say what should be done. Windows can be remarkably resilient, so let's hope that's been the case here."""
Christchurch shootings- Outpouring of UK support to Muslim community,www.bbc.com,,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-47583215,"Report End of Twitter post by @AkeelaAhmed
Flags have been lowered to half mast at Downing Street and the Foreign Office, as well as in the British town of Christchurch in Dorset, which is twinned with its New Zealand namesake.
Mohammed Kozbar, the vice president of the Muslim Association of Britain, said Muslims in the UK would not be intimidated by terror attacks.
The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, shared a post on Twitter urging Christians to go along to Friday prayers at local mosques.
And the Bishop of London, Sarah Mullally, told the BBC that ""an attack against faith anywhere is an attack on faith everywhere"". 'Sadness, solidarity and anger'
By Alex Therrien from BBC News, at the East London Mosque
There was sadness and solidarity, but also anger, at a vigil at the East London Mosque, held in memory of the victims of the New Zealand attack.
Posters saying ""no to Islamophobia"" and ""this will not divide us"" were held up as Mayor of London Sadiq Khan and faith leaders gave short speeches. But among many of the gatherers the BBC spoke to there was also anger and fear.
Fear about whether such an attack could happen in the UK. And anger at what they see as the normalisation of Islamophobia in parts of the media and among politicians.
""These are the ones we should be pointing the finger at,"" said one man who refused to give his name.
""They are the ones who caused this.""
The London mayor did not name politicians or the media directly, but strongly hinted at their role in influencing people and having a role in them becoming radicalised.
""There is a responsibility on all of us to be very careful in the language we use,"" he urged.
The mayor added that diversity in London was a strength, not a weakness. ""We don't simply tolerate it - we embrace and respect it.""
Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was due to attend a vigil at Glasgow Central Mosque on Friday evening, and said the events in New Zealand ""will feel very personal and close to home"" for Muslims.
Meanwhile, Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of the opposition, laid flowers at the High Commission of New Zealand in London, where members of an anti-terrorism group had gathered.
MPs have observed a minute's silence in the House of Commons.
British security minister Ben Wallace called the attack ""repugnant"" and said the UK ""stands shoulder to shoulder with New Zealand against terrorism"".
He said he and Home Secretary Sajid Javid would speak to counter-terrorism police chiefs and the security services on Friday, ""to discuss what further measures we can take to protect our mosques and our communities from any threats here in the United Kingdom"".
Mr Wallace added: ""Our police and security services treat all threats the same and all terrorists the same no matter what communities, religion or background they come from. A terrorist is a terrorist and we shall deal with them exactly the same."""
Canada group sues government over Google's Sidewalk Labs - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-47956760,"Canada group sues government over Google's Sidewalk Labs 16 April 2019 These are external links and will open in a new window Close share panel Image copyright Sidewalk Labs Image caption The city envisaged by Sidewalk Labs would collect data from a range of sources The Canadian Civil Liberties Association is suing three levels of government over a Google-backed plan to build a smart neighbourhood in Toronto.
The association says the project is ""invalid and needs to be reset"".
It is run by the publicly funded Waterfront Toronto and Google-affiliated Sidewalk Labs.
Privacy advocates are concerned the project will increase surveillance and outsource government responsibilities to a private corporation.
""Canada is not Google's lab rat,"" said the association's executive director and general counsel MJ Bryant. ""We can do better. Our freedom from unlawful public surveillance is worth fighting for.""
The association is suing Waterfront Toronto, municipal, provincial and federal governments. Although Waterfront Toronto is funded through federal, provincial and municipal purses, it does not report to the city or the province.
Sidewalk Labs - a firm owned by Google's parent Alphabet - won a bid with Waterfront Toronto in October 2017 to develop a 12-acre patch of industrial landscape in Toronto, Ontario into a ""smart city"".
But the deal struck between the government-funded organisation and Sidewalk Labs has been mired in controversy and shrouded in secrecy.
In February, the Toronto Star reported that Sidewalk Labs intends to expand onto 300 adjacent acres and build a light-rail line - in exchange for a cut of development fees and property taxes.
The land is potentially worth billions, according to the Star.
Jim Balsillie, the former co-CEO of BlackBerry, called the project a ""colonizing experiment in surveillance capitalism attempting to bulldoze important urban, civic and political issues.
""Of all the misguided innovation strategies Canada has launched over the past three decades, this purported smart city is not only the dumbest but also the most dangerous""."
Eleanor Cross: Restoration of Northampton monument begins - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-northamptonshire-47949436,"These are external links and will open in a new window Close share panel Image caption Work was supposed to begin in the autumn, but was delayed Restoration work has started on a 13th Century monument to a medieval queen that was ""falling apart"".
The Eleanor Cross on London Road, Northampton, was built in 1291 for Queen Eleanor, the wife of King Edward I, but needs urgent masonry repairs.
The Â£95,000 work by Northampton Borough Council and Historic England was due to start last autumn, but was delayed.
Scaffolding has been put up and contractors will start lime mortar work on cracks to conclude in late summer.
Mike Ingram, a local resident who has been campaigning to save the cross, said it was a ""huge relief"" that it had not toppled over in the winter because of its poor state.
In January, a Northampton Borough Council meeting heard Queen Eleanor would be ""turning in her tomb"" because her monument had been rotting.
And more than 1,600 people signed a petition calling for netting to protect the monument during the winter months. 'A jewel and joy'
Twelve crosses were built by King Edward I after Queen Eleanor's death near Lincoln in 1290.
They were constructed at each place her funeral cortege stopped on its way to London. The cross in Northampton is one of only three which remain.
Dr David Carrington, from Skillington Workshop, the conservator tasked with completing the repair work, said he would do all he could to ""arrest the rate of decay"".
He said: ""We will look at two things - the structure and corroding iron work. It [the cross] is up there with the best work of the period [13th Century].""
Henry Sanders, from architects Acanthus Clews, said: ""This sort of project is very, very rare. It's also a monument that sticks in people's imagination.
""[The crosses] are intrinsic to the love story between Edward I and Queen Eleanor. It is a jewel and joy to work on as an architect."" Image caption The cross in Northampton is one of only three that remain Related Topics "
A rasher of bacon 'ups cancer risk' - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-47947965,"A rasher of bacon a day 'ups cancer risk' 17 April 2019 These are external links and will open in a new window Close share panel Image copyright Getty Images Even small amounts of red and processed meat - such as a rasher of bacon a day - can increase the risk of bowel cancer, according to research.
The latest study led by Oxford University and funded by Cancer Research UK, adds to evidence, including from the World Health Organization, that eating red meat can be harmful.
But exactly how big is the risk? And how much is too much?
Here's what you need to know. What the study found:
Researchers analysed data from almost half a million people involved in the UK Biobank study.
Over the six years of their study they found 2,609 people developed bowel cancer.
They estimate: Eating three rashers of bacon a day rather than just one could increase the risk of bowel cancer by 20% For every 10,000 people in the study who ate 21g a day of red and processed meat, 40 were diagnosed with bowel cancer The comparable figure for those who ate 76g a day, was 48
According to the NHS, 76g of cooked red meat is equivalent to about half an 8oz sirloin steak. A slice of ham or rasher of bacon is about 23g of processed meat. How much is too much?
It's not clear. Cancer Research UK (CRUK) says 5,400 of the 41,804 cases of bowel cancer seen each year in the UK could be prevented if people did not eat processed meat at all.
According to Emma Shields, information manager at CRUK, ""This study shows the more meat you eat, the higher your risk of getting cancer and obviously the reverse is true - the less you eat the less likely you are to get bowel cancer,""
But she acknowledges smoking poses a much bigger risk, causing 54,300 cases of cancer each year.
Public Health England says from its surveys many people eat too much red and processed meat.
And experts advise people who eat lots of it to find ways to cut down.
The Department of Health advises anyone eating more than 90g a day of red and processed meat should cut down to 70g. Is eating some OK?
NHS guidance says there are some benefits of red meat - iron and protein content, for example - that must be balanced against potential risks.
People can still eat meat and be healthy. What makes it risky?
Processed meat - including bacon, some sausages, hot dogs, salami - is modified to either extend its shelf-life or change the taste - the main methods are smoking, curing, or adding salt or preservatives.
It is thought the chemicals involved in the processing could be increasing the risk of cancer. High temperature cooking, such as on a barbecue, can also create carcinogenic chemicals.
When it comes to red meat like beef, lamb and pork, there are suggestions that one of the proteins (that gives it its red colour) can damage the gut when it is broken down.
But experts are still trying to fully understand the link. What do experts say?
Prof Gunter Kuhnle, at the University of Reading, described the study as a very thorough analysis of the link between meat intake and bowel (also known as colorectal) cancer.
He said: ""The results confirm previous findings that both, red and processed meat consumption, increase the risk of colorectal cancer.
""The increase in risk of approximately 20% per 50g increase of red and processed meat intake is in line with what has been reported previously, and confirms these findings.
""The study also shows that dietary fibre reduces the risk of colorectal cancer. An increased consumption of fibre, as shown by this study, would be of considerably more benefit.""
Carrie Ruxton, of the Meat Advisory Panel, an industry-funded body, said: ""Red meat provides valuable nutrients, such as protein, iron, zinc, vitamin D and B vitamins.""
She said it was known that ""a range of lifestyle factors have a significant impact on the risk of bowel cancer, most notably age, genetics, lack of dietary fibre, inactivity and high alcohol consumption"". "

Coming from a humble background, he stands in sharp contrast to the country's previous leaders, who hailed from the political and military elite.
In 2014 Mr Widodo - more commonly known as Jokowi - stood on a ""man of the people"" anti-corruption platform, promising to tackle poverty and to stamp out nepotism and intolerance. He won decisively.
But the race is not over. Mr Widodo will stand for election again this year against his long-time rival, Prabowo Subianto.
Five years on from the last campaign, his one-of-us image has lost some of its sheen. Rise to the top
Born in 1961 in Solo, a city in the centre of Java, Mr Widodo is the son of a wood-seller.
The furniture-maker began his political career with the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDIP) when he was elected mayor of Solo in 2005.
Mr Widodo then ran to be Jakarta's governor, winning a resounding victory in 2012. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Mr Widodo's career was built on his 'man of the people' image
He was seen to empathise with the poor and grew in popularity through measures such as relocating slum-dwellers and boosting small businesses.
He first campaigned for the presidency on a platform of stamping out corruption, nepotism and intolerance - and pushed for investment in education, meritocracy and increased use of technology in governance.
At Mr Widodo's inauguration in October 2014, he called for a spirit of unity and hard work, and promised to restore national pride as well as building a stronger maritime presence. Religion and resistance
Mr Widodo's administration had a somewhat shaky start.
Critics warned that he lacked experience in national politics and international relations.
His government rushed into some policies, such as banning the sale of alcohol in small shops and mandating Indonesian proficiency among foreign workers, only to backtrack on them later due to their unpopularity or unfeasibility.
Mr Widodo's first international controversy came in April 2015 when he faced global pressure to pardon two Australian members of the Bali Nine drug smuggling ring, who faced death sentences.
He refused, saying a hardline stance against drugs was necessary to protect Indonesia. Image copyright AFP Image caption Mr Widodo faced faced international pressure to free Australian drug traffickers Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan
In recent years, Mr Widodo has pushed to advance Indonesia's infrastructure - building roads, dams and railways. Why Indonesia's next leader will need China
But in order to do it, he has welcomed Chinese investment and accepted loans and partnerships with foreign companies.
His rival, Mr Prabowo, has accused him of selling out the country to foreigners, and opposition lawmakers claim Indonesia is facing an influx of Chinese workers.
A long and occasionally violent history of anti-Chinese sentiment means these are contentious issues, especially in an election year.
Indonesia has in recent years seen conservative religious groups grow increasingly vocal.
Former Jakarta governor and Mr Widodo's ally Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, known more commonly as Ahok, was accused of blasphemy for comments he made during a pre-election speech in September 2016.
After mass rallies in the streets, he was imprisoned for two years - seen as a setback for religious tolerance.
Mr Widodo has shown that he is clearly aware of this rising trend, and has been working hard to display his Islamic credentials. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Mr Widodo and his running mate Ma'ruf Amin (right)
Though he himself has been shown to be a religious moderate, he surprised many by picking Ma'ruf Amin as his running mate for the 2019 election.
He's a powerful cleric who played a key role in the protests that led to Ahok's downfall.
The move has been seen as an attempt to sway more conservative Muslim voters his way, but may have lost him some support among younger, liberal voters. Related Topics "

BBC - Future - The border guards you canât win over with a smile,www.bbc.com,Molly Kendrick,04-17-2019,2019,4,http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20190416-the-ai-border-guards-you-cant-reason-with,"Future Now The border guards you canât win over with a smile Governments are testing artificial intelligence to reduce queues at passport control, spot potentially dangerous travellers and detect smuggled goods at their borders, but can this technology be trusted? By Molly Kendrick 17 April 2019
International travel is increasing at a rapid rate. In 2017, a record 1.4 billion tourists visited other countries last year and that number is expected to reach 1.8 billion by 2030 .
This swelling number of globetrotters also means growing queues at passport control. The vast majority of people who are detained by border agents donât present a threat, which slows down the already often lengthy process of crossing an international border. Border crossing agents have a tough job. They have to make hundreds of judgement-calls every hour about whether someone should be allowed to enter a country. With the looming threat of terrorist attacks, people trafficking and smuggling, there is a lot of pressure to get it right.
Although they may have some additional intelligence on their computer system, when border guards examine most travellers, theyâre relying on their own hunches and experience . And for many border control officers, that experience may not amount to much â itâs a position with a high turnover rate; border guards in the US quit at double the rate of other law enforcement positions.

Anyone who has been stopped from entering a country at immigration, even briefly, will know what an upsetting and stressful experience it can be. Staring into the hard eyes of a border guard as they examine your passport is always a nerve-wracking experience.
But there could soon be another, unseen border agent with a hand in these decisions â one that cannot be reasoned with or softened with a smile. View image of A border guard checking a passport (Credit: Getty)
A number of governments around the world are now funding research on systems powered by artificial intelligence that can help to assess travellers at border crossings.
One of these is being developed by US technology firm Unisys, a company that began working with US Customs and Border Patrol following the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001, to develop technology for identifying dangerous passengers long before they board a flight. Their threat assessment system, called LineSight, slurps up data about travellers from different government agencies and other sources to give them a mathematical risk evaluation.
They have since expanded its capability to look for other types of traveller or cargo that might be of concern to border officials. John Kendall, director of the border and national security program at Unisys, uses an example of two fictional travellers to illustrate how LineSight works.
Romain and Sandra are ticketed passengers who have valid passports and valid visas. They would pass through most security systems unquestioned, but LineSightâs algorithm picks up something fishy about Romainâs travel patterns â sheâs visited the country several times over the past few years with a number of children who had different last names, something predictive analytics associates with human trafficking.
âRomain also purchased her ticket using a credit card from a bank associated with a sex trafficking ring in Eastern Europe,â says Kendall. LineSight is able to obtain this information from the airline Romain is flying with and cross check it with law enforcement databases. View image of The prototype Line Sight system (Credit: Molly Kendrick)
âAll of this information can be gathered and sent to a customs official before Romain and Sandra check in for their flight,â adds Kendall. âWe collect data from multiple sources. Different governments collect different information, whether itâs from their own databases, from travel agencies. Itâs not neat.â
The system can take a similar approach to analysing cargo shipments, helping to pull together relevant information that might identify potential cases of smuggling.
The power of Unisysâs AI approach is the ability to ingest and assess a huge amount of data in a very short amount of time â it takes just two seconds for LineSight to process all of the relevant data and complete a threat assessment..
Algorithms trained to recognise patterns or behavior with historic data sets can reflect the biases that exist in that information
But there are concerns about using AI to analyse data in this way. Algorithms trained to recognise patterns or behaviour with historic data sets can reflect the biases that exist in that information. Algorithms trained on data from the US legal system, for example, were found to replicate an unfair bias against black defendants, who were incorrectly identified as likely reoffend at nearly twice the rate as white criminals . The algorithm was replicating the human bias that existed in the US justice system.
Erica Posey of the Brennan Center for Justice fears similar biases could creep into algorithms used to make immigration decisions.
âAny predictive algorithm trained on existing data sets about who has been prevented from travelling in the past will almost certainly rely heavily on proxies to replicate past patterns,â she says.
According to Kendall, Unisys hope to deal with this by allowing its algorithm learn from its mistakes.
âIf they stop somebody, and it turns out there was nothing wrong, that automatically updates the algorithm,â he says. âSo every time we do an assessment the algorithm gets smarter. Itâs not based on intuition, itâs not based on my bias â itâs based on the full population of travellers that come through.â
The company also says LineSight doesnât assign one piece of data more weight than another, instead presenting all the relevant information to the border and customs officers.
There are some who hope that artificial intelligence might be better at picking up signs of deception
But there are other teams that are looking to go even further by allowing machines to make judgements about whether travellers can be trusted. Human border officers make decisions about this based on a personâs body language and the way they answer their questions. There are some who hope that artificial intelligence might be better at picking up signs of deception.
Aaron Elkins, a computer scientist at San Diego State University, points out that humans are typically only able to spot deception in other people 54 % of the time . By comparison, AI-powered machine vision systems have been able to achieve an accuracy of over 80% in multiple studies. Infrared cameras that can pick up on changes in blood flow and pattern recognition systems capable of detecting subtle ticks have all been used. View image of A queue at passport control in an airport (Credit: Getty)
Elkins himself is one of the inventors behind Avatar (Automated Virtual Agent for Truth Assessments in Real Time), a screening system that could soon be working with real-life border agents. Avatar uses a display that features a virtual border agent that asks travellers questions while the machine scrutinises the subjectâs posture, eye movements, and changes in their voice.
After experiments of tens of thousands of subjects lying in a laboratory setting, the Avatar team believes they have managed to teach the system to pick up on the physical manifestations of deception.
Another system, called iBorder Ctrl is to be tested at three land border crossings in Hungary, Greece and Latvia . It too features an automated interviewer that will interrogate travellers and has been trained on videos of people either telling the truth or lying.
There is an ongoing debate about whether such AI âlie detectorsâ actually work
Keeley Crocket, an expert in computational intelligence at Manchester Metropolitan University in the UK, who is one of those developing iBorder Ctrl, says the system looks for micro-gestures â subtle nonverbal facial cues that include blushing as well as subtle backward and forward movement. Crocket has high hopes for this first phase of field tests, saying the team are hoping the system will âobtain 85% accuracyâ in the field tests."

The man, 47, had gone to feed the stag on his property in Victoria when the attack happened on Wednesday morning.
The woman suffered life-threatening injuries after going to her husband's aid, local media said. She was flown to hospital for treatment.
A recent study into all deaths caused by animals in Australia between 2000 and 2013 found none had involved deer.
Study author Dr Ronelle Welton told the BBC that she was not aware of any deer attacks featuring in Australian coroner's records.
Police said they had euthanised the deer at the scene near Wangaratta, about 250km (155 miles) north-east of Melbourne.
Local media said that the injured woman was helped from the deer's pen by her teenage son. The family had had the animal for about six years, it was reported.

UK universities face 'gagging order' criticism - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/education-47936662,"UK universities face 'gagging order' criticism By Rianna Croxford BBC News 17 April 2019 These are external links and will open in a new window Close share panel Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Anahid Kassabian felt bullied out of her job after she was diagnosed with cancer UK universities are being accused of using ""gagging orders"" to stop bullying, discrimination and sexual misconduct allegations becoming public.
Dozens of academics have told BBC News they were ""harassed"" out of their jobs and made to sign non-disclosure agreements after making complaints.
Figures obtained by the BBC show UK universities spent about Â£87m on pay-offs with NDAs since 2017.
Universities UK says using NDAs to keep victims quiet should not be tolerated.
Non-disclosure agreements were designed to stop staff sharing trade secrets if they changed jobs, but now lawyers say they are being misused to protect serial perpetrators of misconduct, and ministers say they want to tighten the rules. Are NDAs being abused? The music professor
Anahid Kassabian, a former music professor at the University of Liverpool, said she felt like she was treated as a ""burden"" and ""bullied out"" of her 10-year job after being diagnosed with cancer.
She has broken her NDA in the hope that others who have been ""through the same horrors"" will realise they are ""not alone"" and will feel empowered to speak out.
""We all think we're isolated and alone, sobbing over past wrongs, when in fact there are many, many of us, and if we could speak to each other it would feel very different,"" she said.
Ms Kassabian, 59, who also has multiple sclerosis and fibromyalgia, believes her medical conditions had led to her ability to work being called into question, without the causes of the emotional stress she was under being adequately addressed.
But the BBC has seen documents that suggest the university felt it had done all it could to support Ms Kassabian, and it had a responsibility to support the teaching of students and work in the department as well as staff.
The University of Liverpool said: ""We refute these allegations in the strongest possible terms. Ms Kassabian was not subject to discrimination or bullying and the university did not fail to make reasonable adjustments.
""Settlement agreements with a standard confidentiality clause are used for a range of cases including conduct, capability and redundancy. As we too are bound by confidentiality, we are unable to provide specifics in relation to her case."" 'Followed to new job'
Another academic, Amy, not her real name, says bullying sparked her depression.
""It's crippling my career,"" she told the BBC.
Amy says she has been bullied for six years across two universities by the same man.
Her NDA, seen by the BBC, explicitly names the senior academic whom she calls a ""serial bully"".
It means she is legally required not to reveal details of the allegations or she risks being sued.
""He told me I'd never have a successful career,"" she said.
""He has done nothing but undermine my confidence; it's a complete abuse of power.""
After she put in a complaint, Amy says she was advised to sign an NDA and leave.
""I ended up hundreds of miles away at a new university, only for him to follow me and continue his harassment. Because of the NDA I can't tell people what went on in the past. I can't tell them why he's doing this.
""Universities would rather pay off people to leave, than push out the person doing the bullying.""
A source close to the settlement process, who has overseen a number of maternity and disability discrimination cases, said their university had a fund to get rid of staff with ""significant health problems"".
Claims of the misuse of NDAs by universities follow high-profile cases in the film and business worlds. The astrophysicist Image caption Emma Chapman refused to sign an NDA after a two-year challenge for sexual harassment
Emma Chapman, an award-winning astrophysicist, says she was sexually harassed by a man at University College London and received a Â£70,000 payout after a two-year legal challenge.
She refused to sign an NDA in favour of a confidentiality waiver, believed to be the first of its kind, allowing her to defend herself.
But Dr Chapman says the ""trauma of the original incident is still there"" with ""nightmares of [her] house being set on fire"".
Shortly after her tribunal, she received several untraceable voicemails of a person laughing down the phone in the middle of the night.
She reported it to the police, but there was no concrete evidence it was her harasser.
Now a campaigner to end sexual misconduct in higher education with The 1752 Group, Dr Chapman wants ""to see this culture of silence banished and confidentiality waivers being given as standard, so that victims can protect their careers and universities are held to account"".
UCL says it no longer uses NDAs for cases of bullying, harassment and sexual misconduct, but acknowledges that ""historically"" it has ""not always got the balance right"".
""We hope this sends a clear message that these behaviours will not be tolerated,"" it said.
"" #MeToo has made clear that all institutions can, and must do better, in preventing and addressing these behaviours. UCL is no exception."" A widespread problem?
The BBC sent Freedom of Information requests to 136 UK universities, asking how much they had paid in settlements that included ""gagging clauses"".
Analysis of figures from 96 universities responding in full, reveal about Â£87m spent on about 4,000 settlements in the past two years.
Many universities said they were unable to disclose why the agreements were signed, so it is unclear how many relate to allegations of bullying, harassment or sexual misconduct. Image caption Barrister Georgina Calvert-Lee says universities overuse NDAs to promote a system discrimination and harassment
Some universities attributed the bulk of their multi-million NDA spending to voluntary redundancy packages, but lawyers question whether, if such cases were truly voluntary, gagging clauses would be needed.
Georgina Calvert-Lee, a senior barrister at McAllister Olivarius, has told MPs that NDAs are ""overused to promote systemic discrimination and harassment"" at universities.
""The danger is that you may have one complaint put in, it's settled with an NDA, but then the university takes no action to prevent the misconduct happening again, and this exposes others to further misconduct by the same perpetrator,"" she said.
Ms Calvert-Lee said that universities have to provide independent legal advice to affected staff, but that this is usually only ""enough time to talk through the agreement and not about the circumstances that have led to it"".
Universities UK, which represents 136 institutions, said it was important to note that signing an NDA ""does not prevent staff or students from reporting criminal acts to the police or regulatory bodies, or from making a disclosure under The Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998 "".

Alberta election: UCP wins majority victory over NDP - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-47901703,"Image copyright Reuters Image caption Alberta premier-designate Jason Kenney celebrates on election night at party headquarters The right-leaning United Conservative Party (UCP) has taken power in the oil-rich Canadian province of Alberta, routing the left-leaning NDP.
The UCP won 63 of the 87 seats of the legislature, provisional results say.
Leader Jason Kenney, a former federal cabinet minister, will be the next premier of Alberta.
The win could reverberate beyond Alberta, setting the party on a collision course with PM Justin Trudeau's Liberals over climate change.
Mr Kenney has vowed to do away with a provincial carbon levy and to join four other provinces - including Ontario, Canada's most populous province - in fighting the federal government in court over its carbon tax.
The billion-dollar pipeline Canada can't build Canada country profile The government recently imposed carbon taxes on four of Canada's 10 provinces - Ontario, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and New Brunswick - for failing to introduce their own plans for tackling climate change.
The UPC leader said he would also challenge proposed federal legislation to overhaul how major infrastructure and energy projects are reviewed and hold a referendum in Alberta on equalisation payments - a federal payout system to even out fiscal disparities among provinces - unless new pipelines are built.
Mr Trudeau offered congratulations to Mr Kenney on Wednesday, saying in a statement that he looks forward to addressing ""issues of importance to Albertans and all Canadians"" including ""taking decisive action on climate change while getting our natural resources to market"".
Image copyright Reuters Image caption Alberta is home to much of Canada's oil reserves The UCP's victory ends four years in power for the NDP, whose 2015 victory rocked one of Canada's most conservative provinces.
The 28-day election campaign in Canada's fourth most populous province centred around its uneasy economic future and its beleaguered energy sector.
In his victory speech, the premier-designate promised quick relief for Albertans.
""Alberta is open for business,"" he said. ""Albertans have elected a government obsessed with getting Albertans back to work.""
Voters in the country's oil heartland are worried about the state of the economy amid slumping commodity prices.
""For Alberta voters, the election was driven almost entirely by economic concerns; specifically, the province's deep-seated anxiety about its oil and gas industry and the inability to increase the amount of oil it can get to market,"" said national non-profit pollster Angus Reid.
Thousands of jobs were lost following the global oil price crash in 2014-15 - economic doldrums inherited by the NDP, which was seeking a second mandate.
There is widespread frustration at the lack of progress on building new oil export pipelines.
Mr Kenney campaigned as a champion of the oil sector, promising to fund a ""war room"" to defend Canada's energy resources at home and abroad.
The campaign also served as a test with Alberta voters for Mr Kenney and his newly formed UCP, founded in 2017 with the merger of two right-leaning provincial political parties.
The one-time federal politician, who was one of the most prominent ministers serving under former Conservative prime minister Stephen Harper, came to Alberta to unite fractured right-leaning political parties.
But Mr Kenney was often knocked off message during the campaign as controversial or offensive views expressed by some candidates came to light. Two candidates eventually resigned.
His 2017 UPC leadership campaign has also come under scrutiny amid allegations his camp colluded with a ""kamikaze"" candidate to discredit his main rival."

EU proposes tariffs on Â£15bn of US products in Boeing row - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-47962454,"EU proposes tariffs on Â£15bn of US products in Boeing row 17 April 2019 These are external links and will open in a new window Close share panel Image copyright Reuters The EU has proposed tariffs on $20bn (Â£15bn) of US goods in a long-running dispute over Boeing aircraft subsidies.
The proposal comes after the WTO said earlier this month that the US had failed to remove some Boeing subsidies.
The EU move comes after the US said it was considering tariffs on about $11bn (Â£8.4bn) worth of EU goods in response to Airbus subsidies.
And it comes after the EU approved plans in April for trade talks with the US designed to reduce trade barriers.
EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia MalmstrÃ¶m said: ""European companies must be able to compete on fair and equal terms.
""The recent WTO ruling on US subsidies for Boeing is important in this respect. We must continue to defend a level-playing field for our industry.""
The proposed tariffs cover a range of products from aircraft to chemicals and food products including frozen fish, citrus fruit, and ketchup.
Analysis: BBC economics correspondent Andrew Walker
The EU's threat to impose new tariffs on US goods doesn't exactly lighten the mood in a situation where global trade tensions have already intensified.
But this proposal - like the corresponding US plan for action against the EU over subsidies to Airbus - is consistent with the established rules of the World Trade Organization.
Both sides have published lists of goods for consultation and both say they will wait for a WTO arbitrator to tell them how much action they should take.
It's an important difference from the dispute between China and US, and American action over steel and aluminium, where it can be argued that countries have gone beyond what the WTO rules permit.
Those actions led to genuine concerns that the rules-based system for managing global trade may be facing serious threats. But the proposed retaliation on aviation does not. Dogfight
The US and the EU have been battling for almost 15 years at the World Trade Organization over subsidies given to US planemaker Boeing and its European rival Airbus.
After partial victories for both sides, each is asking a WTO arbitrator to determine the level of countermeasures they can impose on the other.
The Trump administration last week proposed targeting a seven-page list of EU products for tariffs, ranging from large aircraft to dairy products and wine, to counteract the harm from EU subsidies for Airbus that are worth an estimated $11bn.
The EU has responded with its own 11-page list of US imports , including agricultural produce and dried fruit, to planes, tobacco, handbags, suitcases, tractors, helicopters and video game consoles.
The published list will now be open to consultation until 31 May and could then be revised.
""The EU remains open for discussions with the US, provided these are without preconditions and aim at a fair outcome,"" Ms MalmstrÃ¶m said. Trade talks
In both cases, WTO arbitrators have yet to set an amount, but the US case against Airbus is more advanced, with a ruling possible in June or July. The EU case against Boeing could come early in 2020.
Both sides have said they would prefer a settlement that did not lead to tariffs being imposed.
Meanwhile, the EU has said it is ready to start formal trade talks with the US.
The Commission is set to start two sets of negotiations - one to cut tariffs on industrial goods, the other to make it easier for companies to show products meet EU or US standards.
But the EU has insisted that agriculture will not be included, putting it at odds with the US, which wants farm products to be part of the talks. Related Topics "

Rare kakapo parrots have best breeding season on record - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-47960764,"Rare kakapo parrots have best breeding season on record 17 April 2019 These are external links and will open in a new window Close share panel Image copyright New Zealand Department of Conservation Image caption Kakapo were one of New Zealand's most common birds, but are now on the brink of extinction Kakapos - the world's fattest species of parrot - have had their most successful breeding season on record, according to New Zealand's Department of Conservation (DOC).
The flightless, nocturnal parrots were once one of the country's most common birds, but only 147 adults are left.
This year, 76 chicks have been hatched under the DOC's conservation scheme, with 60 expected to reach adulthood.
The new batch is more than double that of the last breeding season in 2016.
Kakapos only breed every two to four years when their favourite fruit grows in New Zealand's Rimu trees - the period is known as a ""mast year"".
Their numbers have also been curbed by hunting, deforestation, and predators like stoats which were introduced by European settlers.
One scientific advisor to the DOC, Dr Andrew Digby, says scientists have seen bumper quantities of fruit on Rimu trees in recent years, an occurrence possibly caused by climate change. With so much fruit, many female kakapos have bred earlier and, in some cases, laid two clutches of eggs. Image copyright Andrew Digby/NZ Department of Conservation Image caption All newborn kakapo chicks are raised in a secure facility before being released into the wild
Until the 1970s, kakapos were thought to be extinct but a group was discovered on Stewart Island, south of the country's South Island.
Just 18 were known to exist by 1977, but New Zealand's DOC has spearheaded efforts to boost its population on two remote, predator-free islands.
Under the scheme, all newborn kakapo chicks are raised in a secure facility and later released into the wild, tagged with a transmitter.
Each parrot also has its nest fitted with sensors and cameras, and is given a tailored diet via nearby feeding stations.
""They don't get a lot of privacy,"" Dr Digby said.
""I can log online and see what they're doing, see who they've mated with, how long for, and even the quality of the mating.
""It's probably one of the most intensively managed species in the world, certainly in New Zealand."" Image copyright Andrew Digby/NZ Department of Conservation Image caption The DOC says it wants to see 500 kakapos in the wild, but is ""attempting to back off"" with each new breeding season
To raise awareness of the bird and the DOC's work, the department hosted a ""chick viewing session"" earlier this month.
The DOC also has an ""advocacy"" kakapo, named Sirocco, who tours the country as an Official Spokesbird for Conservation.
""People fall in love with them,"" said Dr Digby. ""They don't behave like a bird, they're a little bit human.
""They even look like a grumpy old man and they all have different personalities,"" he added.
Looking ahead, Dr Digby said the DOC wants to see population levels hit 500, but is ""continually attempting to back off, with a bit less intensity each breeding season.""
""The aim of our programme is for every child to grow up knowing what a kakapo is, just like an elephant or a lion."" Related Topics"

The 24-year-old had to fight abroad as, despite having the blessing of Iranian sporting authorities, it proved too complicated to fulfil their requirement that the bout be refereed and judged by women.

The Priory fined Â£300k over death of 14-year-old girl - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-sussex-47940769,"Image copyright Family handout / PA Image caption Amy El-Keria was found hanged in her room in November 2012 The Priory healthcare group has been fined Â£300,000 over the death of a child at one of its hospitals.
Amy El-Keria, 14, was found hanged in her room at the Priory in Ticehurst, East Sussex, in November 2012.
The private company, which runs mental health services as part of an NHS contract, was sentenced at Lewes Crown Court.
In 2016, an inquest found her death may have been prevented if she had received proper care.
'Profit over safety' The Health and Safety Executive pursued a criminal investigation and the company admitted a charge of being an employer failing to discharge its duty to ensure people were not exposed to health and safety risks.
In sentencing, Judge Mr Justice James Dingemans said no financial penalty he could impose would ever ""reflect the loss suffered by Amy's family"".
Speaking outside court, Amy's mother Tania El-Keria said: ""The public's eye has been firmly opened to what the Priory stand for, profit over safety.
""Today is a historic day in our fight for justice for Amy.
""Our Amy died in what we know to be a criminally unsafe hospital being run by the Priory.""

She said the Priory's contract with the NHS should not carry on. ""I don't believe there's any lessons learned,"" she added.
A court hearing in January was told Amy, who was deemed high-risk and had a ""known and recent history"" of suicide attempts, was admitted to the hospital on 23 August 2012.
She was left with unsupervised access and the means to carry out another suicide attempt.
On November 12, she was found with a ligature around her neck and taken to Conquest Hospital in Hastings, where she died the next day.
The inquest into her death heard staff at the unit had not been trained in resuscitation and did not call 999 quickly enough.
The jury said Amy died of unintended consequences of a deliberate act, contributed to by neglect, and that staffing levels at the Ticehurst centre were inadequate.
Priory faces heavy fine over girl's death
Hospital 'neglected' girl found hanged
Judge Dingemans said: ""It is apparent from the investigations that have been carried out in Amy's death, and the works carried out by Priory Healthcare and the CQC [Care Quality Commission], that there is now a much better understanding of young person suicide, and that vital lessons have been learned.""
When imposing the fine, he said he took into account the company's ""good"" health and safety record, guilty plea and steps made to improve the service.
Priory Healthcare had a turnover of Â£133m in 2017, with an operating profit of Â£2m, he said.
It must also pay the Health and Safety Executive's costs of Â£65,800 and a victim surcharge of Â£120.
Image copyright The Priory Group Image caption Amy El-Keria was admitted to the Priory Hospital in Ticehurst a few months before she died In a statement, the charity Inquest, which supported the family, said it was ""a historic moment in terms of accountability following deaths of children in private mental health settings"".
Victoria McNally, a senior caseworker at the charity, said: ""Allowing the Priory to investigate their own actions, meant it took six-and-a-half years for their criminally unsafe practises to be exposed.
""If we are serious about child safety and welfare, such a blatant lack of oversight and scrutiny cannot continue.""
Trevor Torrington, head of the Priory Group, said: ""The latest CQC report, published in January this year, rated Ticehurst as ""good"" in all areas.

Jet Airways extends flight suspensions until next week - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-47963536,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Taking the last flight of India's stricken Jet Airways Troubled Indian airline Jet Airways has temporarily suspended all its domestic and international flights after failing to find fresh funding.
The airline said its last flight would operate on Wednesday as it was not able to pay for fuel and other critical services.
Jet Airways said it had no choice but to suspend the flights, but hopes to start flying again.
It has $1.2bn (Â£900m) debt and has been in talks with lenders for weeks.
Jet Airways, which has 123 planes, was once India's biggest private airline, but reports say that just five planes have been in use.
In a statement the airline said it had been forced to ground all its flights because ""prolonged and sustained efforts with lenders and authorities did not yield the desired results"".
The Indian government had asked state-run banks to step in with a bailout plan for the airline - which employs 23,000 people and was founded by Naresh Goyal more than 25 years ago. He stepped down as chairman last month.
India's aviation boom runs into turbulence Jet Airways fails to secure emergency funding The riches to rags story of India's oldest private airline Pilots, engineers, and ground staff have not been paid for months, and passengers have been left stranded around the world as a result of cancellations.
""Late last night, Jet Airways was informed by the State Bank of India (SBI), on behalf of the consortium of Indian lenders, that they are unable to consider its request for critical interim funding,"" the airline said.
""Since no emergency funding from the lenders or any other source is forthcoming, the airline will not be able to pay for fuel or other critical services to keep the operations going. Consequently, with immediate effect, Jet Airways is compelled to cancel all its international and domestic flights. The last flight will operate today,"" it added.
Community and concern on Jet's last flight Ravinder Singh Robin, BBC Punjabi
Jet's last flight before the suspension departed from Amritsar and as the flight took off the brightness of the iconic Golden Temple was visible through the night sky.
It was an emotional last journey for the crew and even for the ground staff.
""The sun will rise again,"" the pilot told me before he took charge. He had worked for the airline for 17 years and was hopeful of reprieve.
Many people didn't even bother turning up for the flight, mistakenly believing this would be cancelled too but for those who did make it on board there was a palpable sense of community and concern for the staff of Jet Airways.
Image caption Ground staff prepare for Jet Airways last flight, departing from Amritsar to Mumbai and Delhi. Passengers asked cabin crew what was to happen to their jobs, where they would go from here. There have been no clear answers for Jet staff - and many felt a deal would come through, but worry was nevertheless etched on their faces.
Many were asking questions about their onward journeys and felt frustration at the state of India's airline industry, remembering the fate of Kingfisher Airlines.
Yet others booked tickets on this particular flight just to make history.
Before the flight touched down, the pilot spoke a few optimistic words to the passengers telling them this may be the last flight for now, but he very much hoped they would fly Jet once again.
The banks have been seeking a bidder for the airline, which said it would continue to support them in their efforts.
Etihad Airways already owns 24% of Jet Airways and is reported to have expressed an interest in taking more control.
""Jet Airways is hopeful that it will be able to bring the joy of flying back to its guests as soon as possible,"" the airline said.
 Image caption Naresh Goyal founded Jet more than 25 years ago The carrier operated 600 domestic and 380 international routes, including out of London, Amsterdam and Paris, and had grown rapidly before it started to lose market share after the entry of low-cost airlines like IndiGo & SpiceJet.
The UK's Civil Aviation Authority tweeted advice to customers, outlining different approaches for seeking refunds depending on how the flight was booked.

PC David Alston sent the offensive texts and video clips of extreme pornography to a WhatsApp group between March and June 2017.
He was caught when officers began an unrelated investigation involving a member of the group.
Essex Police suspended him when the messages were discovered.
A spokesman for the force said the officer used his own phone to send the texts and it was a coincidence he was found out.
""The messages came to light during a domestic abuse-related investigation involving another member of the same WhatsApp group"".
A police misconduct hearing took place at Chelmsford Civic Centre and the panel found PC Alston, who was based at Braintree, breached police standards of professional behaviour.
It ruled he should be dismissed without notice.
Det Supt Dean Chapple said: ""Racism and homophobia is absolutely disgusting and has no place in our society, let alone within the police force.
""PC Alston was a highly respected and capable officer however his conduct, whilst off duty and in the presence of selected friends who were not associated with policing, fell way below the standards we expect of our officers and in no way represents our values.""
The Minority Ethnic Support Association chair, PCSO Macdonald Neife, said: ""We are not aware of any systemic racist or negative cultural behaviour, but would encourage any colleagues who are aware of unacceptable behaviour to report this through the channels available."" Related Topics"
Netflix to trial showing top 10 lists to UK users - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-47963495,"Netflix to trial showing top 10 lists to UK users 17 April 2019 These are external links and will open in a new window Close share panel Image copyright Netflix Image caption Sex Education, Bird Box and You have been big successes for Netflix Netflix is to start showing UK users a Top 10 list of the most popular programmes on the platform.
It will be the first time it has done this anywhere in the world.
It will be trialled for several months and show the most popular content over the previous week.
In a call to investors, company executives said they expected this would make it easier for viewers to engage in a ""public conversation"" about shows.
One media expert believes the lists will serve as a ""promotional tool"" by favouring Netflix-produced programmes. Helen Mirren gives Netflix short shrift
In a letter to investors the company explained that it would release ""weekly top 10 lists of the most popular content on our UK service"".
However, the streaming service, which is typically tight-lipped about viewing figures, will not reveal how many people watch specific shows.
Users will only be able to infer the relative popularity of the most popular programmes to one another.
In a subsequent call, Netflix executive Greg Peters told investors that the lists should let viewers know ""what are those most popular shows so they can watch and then participate in that public conversation"". 'Promotional tool'
Not everybody believes that the move is solely for the benefit of viewers.
""The point of the release of this data isn't for granular understanding as to what people are actually watching on the service, it is for promotional purposes,"" media-watcher Tom Harrington of Enders Analysis, told the BBC.
""Given its escalating spend on original content, Netflix is always keen to push the narrative that originals are what drive the service.""
Mr Harrington expects the weekly top 10 lists to favour Netflix original programmes, which often receive prominent placements on the platform after their release.
""The list will disguise what is actually watched on the service, which is predominantly acquired content. It will likely be dominated by newly-released originals, the demand for which often quickly declines soon after release."" he added.
The trial is expected to start in the next two months. If the company judges it to be a success, Top 10 could be rolled out to users in other countries. Related Topics"
Notre-Dame fire: Paris blaze inspires help for US black churches - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-47961014,"Image copyright CBS Image caption Debris at one of the church fires in Louisiana's St. Landry Parish The outpouring of generosity in response to the fire at Notre-Dame cathedral has led to a renewed focus on fundraising for black churches in the United States that were destroyed by an arsonist earlier this year.
The influx of sympathy and money for the churches led to the appeal reaching its target of $1.8m in three days.
On Monday, as French firefighters tackled the blaze at the 850-year-old building, Louisiana resident Megan Romer tweeted her sadness over the cathedral's destruction.
However, she also took the opportunity to divert her followers' attention to three other churches devastated by fire that did not have billionaires queuing up to save them. Report
""If you are going to donate money to rebuild a church this week, I implore you to make it the black churches in St. Landry Parish,"" Ms Romer wrote.
She was referring were three historically black churches in Louisiana that were subject to arson attacks in late March and earlier this month. St Mary Baptist Church, the Greater Union Baptist Church and the Mount Pleasant Baptist Church were razed to the ground.
When Ms Romer wrote her appeal, the fundraising page of the three churches was far short of its $1.8m goal - with fewer than $100,000 raised.
While acknowledging the huge importance of the French cathedral, she wrote: ""Remember that famous history isn't the only history. Imagine the courage it took to build and fill a black house of worship in post-bellum rural Louisiana. And now.""
Since Monday, her tweet has been shared more than 37,000 times as word spread all over social media. Influential figures like Hillary Clinton and CNN anchor Jake Tapper pushed the fundraising page to their followers. Image copyright @HillaryClinton
""The rebuild of Notre-Dame will be well-funded,"" wrote journalist Yashar Ali, who donated $1,000 to the fund.
On Wednesday, total donations for the three churches passed $1m with more than 18,000 people donating. Later that evening, Ali tweeted the $1.8m goal had been reached, including $20,000 donated by model Chrissy Teigen. Image copyright @yashar
""It shows that the church is not only fireproof, but it's also faith-proof,"" Pastor Mason Jack told local news channel News15. ""To get calls from New York, and across the country and to show love for our sister churches means a whole lot to us,"" he said.

US ruling to expand indefinite detention for some asylum seekers - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-47952648,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Five numbers that explain US border crisis Asylum seekers who have proven a credible fear for their safety will no longer be able to ask a judge for bond, the justice department says.
US Attorney General William Barr's decision means more migrants can be indefinitely detained while they wait for their cases to be heard.
The policy will be delayed for 90 days to allow officials to prepare for overcrowding in detention facilities.
Activists denounced the decision and vowed to fight it in court.
The US Justice Department oversees the country's immigration court system, which means Mr Barr has the authority to issue precedent-setting judgments on immigration enforcement.
This judgment, which overturns a George W Bush-era policy from 2005, is Mr Barr's first ruling on immigration since taking office.
The move is seen as an effort to end what President Donald Trump describes as a ""catch-and-release"" policy towards illegal immigrants.
Deportation reversed for husband of US soldier What does the ruling say? The decision overturns a policy that allowed migrants who illegally crossed into the US between official crossing points to apply for bond release after they proved to asylum officers they had a credible fear of persecution or torture if they returned to their country.
But under the new ruling, those migrants must be now kept in detention as they await the outcome of their trial.
Many immigration cases can take over several years to be processed, experts say, due to a historically high backlog in cases.
Image copyright EPA Image caption This is the first immigration ruling by Attorney General William Barr According to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) - the agency responsible for detaining and deporting immigrants in the country illegally - the average daily population of immigrants in detention was over 46,000 for the 2019 fiscal year.
The figure is the highest level the agency has seen since its creation in 2003.

The migrants are still eligible to apply for parole, which the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has discretion to do on a case-by-case basis.
In an acknowledgment that the ruling may clog detention facilities, Mr Barr wrote in his 11-page order: ""I will delay the effective date of this decision for 90 days so that DHS may conduct the necessary operational planning for additional detention and parole decisions.""
 Migrants from Central America seeking asylum speak to a US official after crossing the Rio Grande river The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) threatened to sue over the decision, calling it ""the latest attempt by this administration to punish asylum seekers for seeing refuge in the United States.

Climate change: Central banks warn of financial risks in open letter - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-47965284,"Image copyright PA Image caption Governor of the Bank of England Mark Carney contributed to the open letter The heads of two major central banks have written a stark warning about the financial risks of climate change.
Bank of England governor Mark Carney and France's FranÃ§ois Villeroy de Galhau set out the dangers to the global economy in an open letter.
""If some companies and industries fail to adjust to this new world, they will fail to exist,"" they wrote.
The letter was co-signed by the chair of the climate-focused Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS).
The NGFS is a coalition of 34 central banks which was formed in 2017, with the Bank of England as a founding member. It released its first major report into climate-related financial risks on 17 April.
What does the climate have to do with finance? In the letter published by the Bank of England on Wednesday, Mr Carney and Mr Villeroy de Galhau describe ""the catastrophic effects of climate change"" already having an impact on the planet, such as ""blistering heatwaves in North America to typhoons in south-east Asia and droughts in Africa and Australia"".
They say that ""these events damage infrastructure and private property, negatively affect health, decrease productivity and destroy wealth"".
The NGFS elaborates in its ""call to action"" report, saying that climate change will lead to ""disruptive events such as mass migration, political instability and conflict"" .
This is why world leaders signed the Paris climate agreement in 2015 and committed to reducing their respective countries' carbon emissions, the letter continues, in order to limit the global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees Celsius.
""But this transition brings its own risks,"" they add.
 current drought in Hungary may cause farmers to lose hundreds of billions in income But how, exactly? The NGFS sets out three climate-related financial risks that companies, banks and governments need to fight against.
Physical: These are the immediate problems caused by increasingly frequent climate and weather-related events - such as severe droughts or cyclones that affect crops Transition: For example, when a business moves away from carbon-intensive industries and technologies in a ""sudden or disorderly"" way, their business models and asset valuations can end up taking a hit Liability: When people or businesses claim compensation for losses suffered from either the physical or transition risks, which can have a huge impact on insurers It is the second risk in particular - of switching to a green economy without proper planning - that Mr Carney and Mr Villeroy de Galhau focus on in their letter.
""Carbon emissions have to decline by 45% from 2010 levels over the next decade in order to reach net zero by 2050. This requires a massive reallocation of capital,"" it reads.
More about climate change: Climate change in seven charts Talk to our climate change bot The climate protesters who want to get arrested The full NGFS report adds that ""while urgent action is desirable, an abrupt transition could also have an impact on financial stability and the economy more broadly"".
""The speed and timing of the transition is crucial,"" it continues. ""An orderly scenario, with clear policy signalling, would allow adequate time for existing infrastructure to be replaced and for technological progress to keep energy costs at a reasonable level.
""In contrast, a disorderly, sudden, uncoordinated, unanticipated or discontinuous transition would be disruptive and costly, particularly for those sectors and regions that are more vulnerable to structural change.""
Companies and industries that do not adjust or properly plan for these changes, Mr Carney and Mr Villeroy de Galhau say, ""will fail to exist"".
So what do they propose? They suggest that companies ""integrate the monitoring of climate-related financial risks into day-to-day supervisory work, financial stability monitoring and board risk management"".
In simpler terms - businesses need to make climate change planning an everyday thing.
They also say that central banks should ""lead by example"" by making their own operations more sustainable.
But most importantly, they call for more collaboration within the financial sector, with different companies and bodies sharing information about how they are dealing with these climate risks.
""An important element to achieving effective consideration of climate risks across the financial system is to support internal and external collaboration,"" they write.
The NGFS has also called for regulators to come up with a classification system that shows exactly ""which economic activities contribute to the transition to a green and low-carbon economy"".
""We need collective leadership and action across countries and we need to be ambitious,"" they add.
""The NGFS is the core of the response of central banks and supervisors. But climate change is a global problem, which requires global solutions, in which the whole financial sector has a crucial role to play.""

Mr GarcÃ­a was rushed to hospital in the capital, Lima. His death was confirmed by current President MartÃ­n Vizcarra.
A crowd of supporters gathered outside the hospital building, and were held back by a line of police officers.
Mr GarcÃ­a was accused of taking bribes from Brazilian construction company Odebrecht - claims he denied.
Huge corruption scandal shows no sign of waning Mr GarcÃ­a served as president from 1985 to 1990 and again from 2006 to 2011.
What happened at his home? Officers had been sent to arrest him at his home in the affluent Miraflores neighbourhood in connection with the allegations.
Interior Minister Carlos MorÃ¡n told reporters that when police arrived, Mr GarcÃ­a asked to make a phone call and went into a room and closed the door.
Minutes later, a shot rang out, Mr MorÃ¡n said. Police forced the door open and found Mr GarcÃ­a sitting on a chair with a bullet wound to his head.
Image copyright Reuters Image caption A hearse arrived at the hospital as it was announced that Mr GarcÃ­a had died Ricardo Pinedo, Mr GarcÃ­a's secretary, said the former president had four or five weapons in his home, gifts he had received from the military, and that he had used one of these to shoot himself.
He underwent emergency surgery in the Casimiro Ulloa hospital in Lima.
Health Minister Zulema TomÃ¡s said Mr GarcÃ­a had to be resuscitated three times after suffering cardiac arrests before finally succumbing to his injuries.
In a post on Twitter, Mr Vizcarra said he was ""shocked"" by the former president's death and sent his condolences to his family.

Odebrecht has admitted paying almost $30m (Â£23m) in bribes in Peru since 2004.
But Mr GarcÃ­a maintained he was the victim of political persecution, writing in a tweet on Tuesday that there was ""no clue or evidence"" against him.
In November last year he unsuccessfully applied for political asylum in Uruguay.

What is the Odebrecht scandal? Odebrecht is a Brazilian construction giant behind major infrastructure projects around the world, including venues for the 2016 Olympics and 2014 World Cup in its home country.
But under the glare of anti-corruption investigators the company admitted paying bribes in more than half of the countries in Latin America, as well as in Angola and Mozambique in Africa.
Investigators say Odebrecht bribed officials or electoral candidates in exchange for lucrative building contracts.
BBC South America business correspondent Daniel Gallas says the scandal shows no sign of abating almost four years since it was uncovered.
No other company in Latin America has had such an ability to sustain so many high-level connections across so many different parties and countries for such a long period of time, he says.
Brazil's Odebrecht corruption scandal explained How is Peru affected? Four of Peru's most recent presidents are all being investigated for alleged corruption, with a fifth - Alberto Fujimori - serving a prison sentence for corruption and human rights abuses.
Ex-leader Pedro Pablo Kuczynski was taken to hospital with high blood pressure on Wednesday just days after his own arrest in connection with Odebrecht charges. Reports said he was in intensive care.
The current leader of the opposition, Keiko Fujimori, is also in pre-trial detention on charges of taking $1.2m (Â£940,000) in bribes from Odebrecht.
In October, an opinion poll by Datum showed 94% of Peruvians believed the level of corruption in their country was either high or very high.

Sol Pais was reportedly obsessed with the 1999 Columbine high school massacre, in which two teenagers murdered 12 students and a teacher.
The alleged threat led to school closures, affecting more than 400,000 students, and a manhunt for the woman.
She flew to Denver ahead of the 20th anniversary of the Columbine shooting.
Jefferson County Sheriff Jeff Shrader told reporters on Wednesday that she died from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound.
The FBI earlier tweeted there was no longer a threat to the community and the suspect is deceased.
Image copyright FBI Image caption Sol Pais was reportedly obsessed with the Columbine massacre Officials said at a news conference that local schools would reopen on Thursday and events marking the anniversary of the 1999 shooting would continue on Saturday.
The Miami Beach high school student travelled to Denver from Miami on Monday night and purchased a pump-action shotgun and ammunition, the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office said.
At a second news conference later on Wednesday, FBI Denver special agent in charge Dean Phillips said that ""a combination of her actions and comments"" alerted authorities to Pais as a possible threat.
Mr Phillips said that Pais made comments in person and online related to her ""infatuation"" with Columbine. And she had purchased three one-way tickets to Denver from Miami for 15, 16 and 17 April, before taking the first flight on Monday. Mr Phillips said Pais went directly to purchase the weapon after landing.
Authorities are now conducting an investigation to ensure Pais had no accomplices and that there is no further threat.
""You should feel confident that your law enforcement community is protecting you and keeping you safe,"" Mr Phillips said.
Police had considered her armed and extremely dangerous.
Nearly 30 armed officers swarm the woods near the Echo Park Campground in the Arapaho National Forest, CBS News reports.
The Echo Lake Lodge, nearby to where she was reportedly found, does not open until late May due to weather.
Witnesses told local media that she was seen running naked and armed with a gun in the area earlier on Wednesday. She had last been spotted in the Mt Evans area dropped off by a ""for-rent vehicle"", Mr Phillips said.

A tragedy that cuts deep Nada Tawfik, BBC News, Denver
Anniversaries can be difficult for survivors and the wider community, often triggering traumatic memories.
Littleton was already on high alert because they've faced threats in the past, and this was another scary reminder that the mass shooting will perhaps forever affect life in this city. One Columbine survivor told me that when she heard the news, she questioned her safety and took a different route home in a moment of panic.
Today, schools are closed, empty, and deemed unsafe. John McDonald is in charge of security for the school district that includes Columbine. He told me he was angry that as a country, Americans had done nothing but point fingers for the last 20 years, and as a result children weren't just dead, they were unsafe to attend school.
Columbine isn't even among the 10 deadliest mass shootings in this country any more. Yet, it is still a tragedy that cuts deep and becomes more painful with each reminder that nothing has changed.
 Image caption The Mt Evans area, one hour's drive west of Denver, is covered in snow at this time of year The suspect's family had urged her to turn herself in as authorities launched a manhunt.
US schools close as armed woman hunted ""It's like a bad dream. We don't know. We don't have any ideas,"" her father told CBS News in Miami.
Mr Phillips declined to answer questions related to Pais' mental health.
According to the news outlet, more than 130 schools in and around Denver had closed as officials searched for her.
At the news conference Tuesday afternoon, Mr Phillips said there had been information about a specifically targeted school.
Asked about a possible ""overreach"" in keeping so many students home from school Mr Phillips responded, ""As a parent I would say thank you to the school system for protecting my child.""

The warning coincides with the arrest of nearly 300 people in London this week amid huge protests against climate change.
Nordea Bank's Sasja Beslik told the BBC the protests were ""just the beginning"".
People who were worried about climate change did not feel that had many other ""tools"" at their disposal, he said.
Mr Beslik is in charge of sustainable finance at Nordea, one of the biggest banks in Europe, and the third largest corporation in the Nordic region of Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden.
The fund Mr Beslik manages stopped investing in VW after the emissions scandal and no longer authorises the buying of Facebook stock because of concerns over how the company has been addressing its data privacy issues.
Speaking to 5 Live's Wake up to Money, he said: ""I think this [this week's wave of protests] is just the beginning. If we talk about the number of millennials in Europe and in countries all over the world, they are very concerned about the situation and I don't think they feel that they have too many other tools in their hands to approach this.""

He said the key to forcing companies to change lay not just with grassroots protest, but in the boardroom, because the world's financial sector was ""the biggest global tool at the table"".
""I think it is fairly obvious that the actions taken by politicians and businesses around the world are not enough,"" he said, adding: ""87% of all the capital in the world is not managed in a way that takes into account climate issuesâ¦ If we want to employ the big muscles in the world when it comes to changing the industriesâ¦ you need to deploy financial capital."" 'Public statement'
Earlier this week, Legal & General Investment, which manages Â£1tn worth of UK pension fund investments, said it was putting climate change at the top of its list of concerns when looking into how companies are run.
Sonja Laud, deputy chief investment officer at Legal & General Investment Management, said it was important that investors pushed for change.
""We've seen a lot more engagement especially when we started with this very public statement that we would actually name those where we feel there is not sufficient progress on a corporate level,"" she added.
""There is no individual sector where we would say straight away that we would divest because to us it is all about the engagement and making sure we get the company in line with what we would like to achieve."" Related Topics "
Odebrecht case: Politicians worldwide suspected in bribery scandal - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-41109132,"These are external links and will open in a new window Close share panel Image copyright Getty Images It is the corruption probe that has left politicians around the world looking over their shoulders.
Prosecutors in a dozen countries are untangling a massive web of corruption that ran across a continent and further afield.
Illegal payments may have sloshed through presidential campaigns, boosted the careers of political top brass in country after country, and oiled the wheels of worldwide construction projects including motorways, gas pipelines and hydroelectric dams.
If you have never heard of a company called Odebrecht, you probably do not live in Latin America.
It is a Brazilian construction giant behind venues for the 2016 Olympics, infrastructure for the 2014 World Cup and the metro system in Caracas, plus dams and airport terminals further afield.
But anti-corruption investigators caught up with the company, and it admitted paying bribes in more than half of the countries in Latin America, as well as in Angola and Mozambique in Africa. How high up did bribery go?
Odebrecht played a game of quid pro quo: I will help you pay for your election campaign if you make sure I get that building contract.
In country after country, it is alleged that Odebrecht employees made connections with those in power and those who looked like they would be getting into power soon. They did not restrict themselves to those of any particular political hue.
Almost a third of Brazil's government ministers who served under former president, Michel Temer, have faced investigation, including his foreign minister and chief of staff. The predecessor of current far-right President Jair Bolsonaro, who was arrested and released in a separate corruption case last month, is facing investigation in relation to Odebrecht. He denied all allegations of corruption and accused the country's judiciary of heeding rumours and destroying reputations.
The vice-president of Ecuador , Jorge Glas , became the highest-ranking government official to be convicted in the scandal when he was sentenced in December 2017 to six years in jail. Prosecutors said he took $13.5m (Â£10.2m) in bribes from Odebrecht. Who's who and what's what in corruption probe
Colombia charged a former vice-minister for transport and a former senator. The man who ran the election campaign of the former president, Juan Manuel Santos , has alleged it was financed with irregular Odebrecht payments. Mr Santos, who is a Nobel Peace Prize winner, said he did not authorise any payments or know about them. Image copyright AFP Image caption Colombia's President Santos, left, who negotiated a peace deal ending 60 years of conflict with Farc rebels, has denied authorising Odebrecht to pay for his presidential campaign
Next door in Venezuela , former chief prosecutor Luisa Ortega has fled the country after being sacked. She alleges that President NicolÃ¡s Maduro is implicated and that a top court is blocking an investigation. Odebrecht has denied her other allegation - that they paid $100m (Â£76.5m) to the socialist party's vice-president, Diosdado Cabello. Venezuela has taken unfinished projects away from Odebrecht and blocked the company's bank accounts.
In Peru , four ex-presidents have been placed under investigation. Ollanta Humala and his wife Nadine Herediaare are facing potentially lengthy prison sentences for allegedly receiving payments to fund his presidential campaigns in 2006 and 2011.
Alan GarcÃ­a, who served as president from 1985 to 1990 and again from 2006 to 2011 , killed himself with a bullet to the head on April 17 as police came to arrest him over claims he took bribes from Odebrecht.
Former President Alejandro Toledo, accused of taking $20m in bribes, is thought to be living in the US and the Peruvian government has put up a $30,000 reward for information leading to his arrest.
Staying with Peru, opposition leader Keiko Fujimori has come under preliminary investigation. The attorney general says a note found on Marcelo Odebrecht's mobile phone implicates her. She denied receiving money from the company. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Keiko Fujimori, who ran for president last year in Peru, denies accusations she took Odebrecht bribery
Panama charged 17 people including government officials, and charged Odebrecht $59m in compensation. A lawyer from Mossack Fonseca - the firm at the centre of the Panama Papers leak - accused President Juan Carlos Varela of receiving Odebrecht donations. Mr Varela denies all wrongdoing.
Mexico summoned a former director of state oil company Pemex and other employees to give evidence over alleged Odebrecht bribes, while the Dominican Republic asked Odebrecht for $184m compensation over the next eight years.
Chile started an investigation and seized documents from the Odebrecht offices, while the firm agreed to pay Guatemala $17.9m in compensation for bribes paid to an official for public work, the attorney general's office said in January.
And Brazilian newspaper O Globo reports (in Portuguese) that 29 countries, including Sweden, the US, France and the UK asked Brazil for help with their own Odebrecht investigations. Who is serving jail time?
Ecuador's vice-president Jorge Glas is serving a six-year term after he was convicted of taking $13.5m (Â£10.2m) in bribes from the firm.
Former CEO Marcelo Odebrecht started a 19-year jail term in 2016 after being convicted of paying more than $30m (Â£21m) in bribes to officials in Brazil's state oil company in exchange for contracts and influence. Image copyright AFP Image caption Brazil's Supreme Court released a video last year showing Marcelo Odebrecht testifying
More than 70 other Odebrecht executives were jailed but have agreed to plea deals, that is they agreed to provide information in exchange for more lenient sentences. Some are already out of jail and serving their sentences at home. How they did it: The bribery department
The epicentre of the operation had a much more run-of-the-mill name, the Division of Structured Operations, but it was essentially the bribery department. Employees spent their time bribing government officials and political parties at home and abroad, to win business.
The company has admitted this to US, Brazilian and Swiss prosecutors. Money went through as many as four bank accounts in countries with good banking secrecy laws before getting to a recipient, usually an intermediary to someone with political power.
When the department's employees wanted to communicate, they used a system unconnected to the main computer systems, to avoid detection. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption ""Dracula"" was the nickname given to Senator Humberto Costa
And they gave their recipients flippant codenames: Dracula, Sauerkraut, Decrepit, Totally Ugly. One politician, whose wife was 40 years younger than him, got the codename Viagra. What effect has the scandal had?
Protesters have hit the streets over the Odebrecht case in country after country, and the chain of events has brought corruption to the top of news agendas and prosecutors' agendas.
They are ""clamouring for justice"", political analyst Geovanny Vicente Romero told the BBC
""Protesters are demanding people be held responsible for the negligence and corruption that are part and parcel of the historic inequalities in many of the region's countries,"" he said.
""Overall, people hope that the Odebrecht case will set a precedent so that these situations can be avoided in the future."" Image copyright Reuters Image caption This protester in the Dominican Republic held a sign calling for corrupt people to go to jail What has happened to Odebrecht since?
The value of Odebrecht bonds was sliced. The downturn in construction that went alongside this contributed to a downturn in the Brazilian economy and the credit ratings agency Standard and Poor's cut the company to the lowest grading. It has recovered somewhat but is still far from excellent.
The investigations have even contributed to economic downturn in Brazil, and Peru shaved almost a point off its growth forecasts for 2017, which the government blamed on ""the Odebrecht effect"".
The company's website makes no mention of the scandal, but notes that ""sweeping and profound changes in its transformation process"" were undertaken in 2018, including the replacement of practically the entire Board of Directors to bring ""greater diversity.""
And there have been two CEOs since Marcelo Odebrecht was jailed - but tellingly, neither has had the surname Odebrecht.

US to allow Americans to sue foreign firms over Cuba property seizures - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-47952650," A hotel in downtown Havana The Trump administration has announced that Americans can sue foreign companies that do business in Cuba on property there seized from Americans.
The move marks a sharp change in US policy towards Cuba and has been opposed by Canada and European countries which have threatened to sue.
It is seen as an effort to stem investment in Cuba for its support of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.
The 1959 Cuban Revolution has led to years of US trade restrictions on Cuba.
The policy change was announced during a speech given in Miami by National Security Adviser John Bolton to commemorate the 58th anniversary of the failed US-backed efforts to invade Cuba through the Bay of Pigs.
""Americans who have had their private and hard-earned property stolen in Cuba will finally be allowed to sue,"" Mr Bolton said on Wednesday.
Addressing veterans of the attempted Bay of Pigs invasion, Mr Bolton said the changes ""will honour your courage, and the memory of all those lost"",
He described the new initiative as ""undoing the damage"" of the Obama administration, which sought to normalise diplomatic and economic relations with Cuba.
""Under this administration, we don't throw dictators lifelines,"" Mr Bolton said. ""We take them away.""
In a speech in Miami last year Mr Bolton referred to Venezuela, Cuba, and Nicaragua as a ""troika of tyranny"" and said their governments illustrate the results of ""the perils of poisonous ideologies left unchecked"".
The US accuses Cuba of sending thousands of troops to Venezuela in order to prop up the regime of embattled president NicholÃ¡s Maduro.
A flood of lawsuits The change stems from the Helms-Burton Act, passed by Congress in 1996. A provision of that law had repeatedly been suspended by the previous three US presidents.
Permitting this provision, called Title III, means that Americans whose property was seized following the Cuban Revolution can now sue companies that are accused of having benefited - or having ""trafficked"" - in that property.
US backtracks on Cuba baseball deal Cuban baseball defectors visit Havana The baseball game that brought the US and Cuba closer Those properties are believed to include beachfront homes, ports operated by cruise ship companies and many other investments associated with the tourism sector as well as several other industries.
Mr Bolton also said on Wednesday that anyone who traffics in property stolen from Americans will not be issued a visa to the United States.
The European Union has warned that any litigation against foreign companies will likely be met with counter lawsuits, and vowed to bring the US to the World Trade Organisation to solve the dispute.
Venezuela crisis in nine charts In pictures: Venezuelans search for water amid power cut ""We believe that the issue of outstanding US claims should not be conflated with the cause of furthering democracy and human rights in Cuba, or by our shared desire urgently to find a peaceful and democratic solution to the crisis in Venezuela,"" European Commission foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini and European Trade Commissioner Cecilia MalmstrÃ¶m wrote in a 10 April letter to US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.
Canada's Minister of Foreign Affairs Chrystia Freeland said in a statement on Wednesday that ""Canada is deeply disappointed with today's announcement. We will be reviewing all options in response to this US decision"".
She added that she had spoken to Canadian businesses ""to reaffirm we will fully defend the interests of Canadians conducting legitimate trade and investment with Cuba"".
Johana Tablada, Cuba's deputy director of US affairs wrote on Twitter: ""Before they try to euphorically ride a wave of wickedness and lies, they should take a dose of reality. The world has told John Bolton and the US government to eliminate the criminal blockade against Cuba and the Helms-Burton Act.""
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Maduro: US 'warmongering' in order to take over Venezuela Critics note that some of the ""trafficked"" properties have changed hands many times since they were originally nationalised in the six decades since the revolution which brought Fidel Castro to power.
People who fled Cuba, and later became American citizens, will also be permitted to file lawsuits under the new policy.
Despite President's Obama's lifting of some trade and travel restrictions between the two nations, a trade embargo continues to be in place and can only be lifted by the US Congress.
The EU's ambassador to Cuba, Alberto Navarro told the Associated Press: ""The extraterritorial application of the US embargo is illegal and violates international law.""
In addition to change to the Helms-Burton Act, Mr Bolton announced several other changes to US-Cuba policy. New restrictions to non-family travel to Cuba - called ""veiled tourism"" - will be issued, as well as new limits on remittances to Cuba.
Mr Bolton also announced additional sanctions on Venezuela's central bank and on Nicaragua's Bancorp bank and on Laureano Ortega, a son of President Daniel Ortega.
In his remarks he also warned that ""all external actors, including Russia"" must not take ""provocative actions"" in support of Mr Maduro."
Ohio church apologises for video of students slapping pastor - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-47966644,"Ohio pastor sorry after inviting students to slap him in 'crucifixion lesson' 17 April 2019 These are external links and will open in a new window Close share panel Image copyright Facebook, courtesy of Impact City Church Image caption Associate pastor Jaddeus Dempsey and lead pastor Justin Ross apologised on Monday for the ""inappropriate"" lesson An Ohio church has apologised after a video emerged of students in a youth programme spitting on, slapping and cutting a pastor at his request.
Footage posted on Facebook showed young people lining up to strike associate pastor Jaddeus Dempsey, who intended it to be a lesson on crucifixion before Easter.
The video sparked outrage from parents, prompting an apology from Mr Dempsey.
Mr Dempsey said he meant to show students ""how much Jesus loved them"".
""I am so sorry for misrepresenting the community, the church, the parents, the students"", Mr Dempsey said in a video posted to the church's Facebook page.
""It was not my intention, my intention was just to show them how much Jesus loved them.""
In the video, Mr Dempsey and lead pastor Justin Ross expressed regret over the incident, which took place during a Monday after-school hangout programme at the Impact City Church in Pataskala, Ohio. Teens 'coerced and abused' in relationships
""Jaddeus got up in front of the students and he says, 'I'm going to ask you to do something that might seem a little crazy, but if there's anyone here that would like to spit in my face, you can do so without any repercussions'"", Mr Ross said.
Mr Ross said some students ""were a little caught off guard"", while others were ""excited...because they'd never had an opportunity to spit in someone's face'"".
While some refused, many of the young people accepted the invitation, lining up to spit in Mr Dempsey's face.
Mr Dempsey then invited students to slap him.
Again, though several students declined, some shouting ""no"" in the background, several students participated. One male student rolled up his sleeve before issuing an open-handed slap to the pastor's face, as others clapped and cheered in the background.
Mr Dempsey then offered students a steak knife, asking to be cut in the back. Video shows him removing his shirt and instructing students on where to place the knife.
""He had the opportunity to share a message about Easter"", Mr Ross said of Mr Dempsey, ""And he chose to use an illustration to explain a very important topic about the crucifixion but the illustration went too far."" End of Facebook post by Lola
But for many in the non-denominational church's community, the apology fell short.
Though Mr Dempsey said the idea for the lesson was entirely his, other adults including Mr Ross were present throughout the encounter.
A 12-year-old boy handled the steak knife and his mother, identified as Mandy, told local CBS affiliate WBNS she received a call from a friend who had seen video online and rushed to pick up her son.
""The guy that's in there that's getting spit on, turns around and he grabs the knife and he hands it right to my son"", she said. ""I was very disturbed.""
Mandy told WBNS her son will not be returning to the church and that she has reported the incident to the local sheriff's office.
While most members of the community expressed concern over the video, others rushed to defend both Impact City Church and Mr Dempsey, who said he has been a student leader for almost four years.
""Impact City has amazing pastors, an amazing congregation...and they do so much for the city of Pataskala"", one person commented on the apology video. ""As wrong as this lesson was, if you look at the whole picture, it is a lesson of what Jesus went through."" Image copyright Facebook courtesy of Lola Hatfield Image caption A Snapchat video posted to Facebook showed students spitting on associate pastor Jaddeus Dempsey.
Holly Collier, who attended Impact City Church for two years said she was ""broken-hearted"" watching the video.
""It was a terrible judgment call,"" she told the BBC.
Ms Collier said her daughter, Kelsey, 16, attended a summer camp led by Mr Dempsey two years ago.
""Jaddeus has a very pure heart"", Ms Collier said. ""I honestly believe he had good intentions.""
Kelsey told the BBC that Mr Dempsey ""is the most fun-loving guy you will ever meet.""
""Jaddeus and people in that church were always there for us...they're the most understanding, least judgmental people you will ever meet"", she said.
""I don't think someone should be judged just based on one mistake, that one mistake doesn't define who he is.""
Kelsey said that three of her friends were at the church that evening, but none participated in assaulting Mr Dempsey.
""They didn't take part in it"", she said. ""It just blew their minds.""
According to a second post on the Impact City Church Facebook page, a formal review and investigation has now been launched by the board of directors.
""Our pastor is making himself available to meet personally with every student and their parents who were present at the student gathering on Monday"", the post read. ""Our staff will be reaching out to these families as soon as possible."" Related Topics "
The Ugandan love of grasshoppers - and how to harvest them,www.bbc.com,,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-46357020,"These are external links and will open in a new window Close share panel Image caption During grasshopper season they can be bought by the handful across Uganda It is grasshopper season in Uganda, where they are seen as a nutritious delicacy - either boiled or deep-fried. They are so popular that some are worried about declining harvests, as the BBC's Patience Atuhaire reports.
It is dusk. Rusty oil barrels are lined up in rows. Wooden scaffolding holds up unpainted iron sheets. The blindingly bright lights are rigged up as if for a sports stadium. But the four young men are not preparing to play football, they are here to catch grasshoppers.
At this time of year, during the rainy season, the scene is repeated in many towns across the country.
""When the season starts, we watch the cycle of the moon, and prepare. [They tend to come out at full moon]. We also keep hoping for rain. The larger numbers appear when it has rained,"" says Quraish Katongole, one of Uganda's most experienced grasshopper trappers. Image caption The trappers catch their prey using bright lights, grass smoke and metal sheeting
He is the chairman of a group that coordinates the grasshopper trade around the country.
As his workers set up the last of the barrels at a trapping site here on the edge of Masaka town, he heads off to supervise work at other locations. Salty, crunchy flavour
As it grows darker, the slim-bodied nocturnal insects start to swarm around the lights. Most of them are green, but there are sprinklings of ashy-brown and golden-brown.
The trappers burn fresh grass and the rising smoke makes the insects dizzy. The grasshoppers smash against the iron sheets, falling straight into the drums. It sounds like fat raindrops on a tin roof. And as the numbers increase, it becomes a steady downpour.
Women, schoolgirls still in their uniforms, even children, scour the bushes surrounding the traps, picking up the escapees that have avoided the barrels, before they can burrow further into the greenery. Image caption The grasshoppers smash against the iron sheeting and fall into the empty oil drums
The edible insects are a delicacy in many Ugandan communities, and for the urban population, a sought-after snack.
During rush hour in the capital, Kampala, young people with baskets or plastic buckets, weave through the traffic selling boiled or deep fried ready-to-eat grasshoppers to commuters. A tablespoonful costs 1,000 Uganda shillings ($0.27, Â£0.21).
Others sell fresh green ones, with the wings and legs already plucked off, that can be prepared at home.
Even though most Ugandans love the grasshoppers, I last tasted them as a child, so I vaguely remember the crunchy, salty flavour.
But the idea of popping a roasted insect into my mouth has never appealed to my grown-up taste-buds. 'Eat more insects'
Ugandans, and others in the region, are among over two billion people worldwide who eat different species of insects, according to a UN estimate.
A 2013 UN Food and Agriculture Organization report urged others who were not already munching insects to consider adding them to their diet, saying that this could boost nutrition and the amount of food available.
But in Uganda, the number of grasshoppers could be falling as their feeding and breeding habitats around Lake Victoria are shrinking.
Every year between 2010 and 2015 the country lost over 46,000 hectares (114,000 acres) of its natural forest cover, according to the National Forest Authority.
In the greater Masaka area, which is the traditional hub of the grasshopper industry, 9,000 hectares of wild habitat were converted into farmland or for settlement use between 1990 and 2005.
Nearby, on the road towards Bukakata Port on the shores of Lake Victoria, large trees have been felled in a forest reserve. Large swathes of what was formerly forest and grassland are now pineapple plantations. Image caption Grasshoppers be sold fresh, boiled or fired
Mr Katongole has witnessed this transformation.
""There was a huge natural forest and swamps in this area, and in the islands; they were all cut down. That resulted in the numbers of grasshoppers appearing in this region each season declining,"" he says.
Speaking from 30 years' experience in the trade, he adds: ""You'd hear people say; 'I am going to Masaka, that is where there are grasshoppers', but that has changed.""
And the evidence from the night's work backs that up.
The young men empty the drums pouring their catch into white sacks. For all that frenzied swarming, they manage to fill just two sacks. Grasshopper transport
""There was a time when I would catch 20 to 25 sacks a night,"" Mr Katongole comments, crestfallen.
At about 05:00 local time (02:00 GMT), he loads up a saloon car with sacks collected from around town and a colleague makes the three-hour drive to Kampala, where each sack can fetch at least $80 (Â£63).
But the demand for grasshoppers is not only in the capital.
The morning brings a whirlwind of activity in the main market on the outskirts of Masaka. To attract buyers, vendors call out prices, while some adopt a musical approach by singing and clapping their hands. Image caption Market traders can sell a cupful for 5,000 Uganda shillings ($1.34)
Some sell out of barrels, while others use large plastic buckets or trays. Grasshoppers in all forms are on display; sellers measure out cupfuls or handfuls of fresh ones into plastic bags.
Saucepans of boiling insects sit on charcoal stoves.
Agnes Nansamba is smiling as she cooks. A smaller harvest means more customers for her. She lifts a pan and shakes it, turning the grasshoppers over. 'God-given' treat
""We used to sell here all day and you would not get enough customers. But today, I've boiled just 12 cupfuls. I will sell each at 5,000 Uganda shillings ($1.35). A few weeks ago, the price was [even] higher,"" she says.
As we speak, a truck with sacks hanging from metal railings pulls up. Many of the traders run over to replenish their stock.
In the melee, no-one gives a thought as to where the insects appear from. They just know that they come in May and November, when the rains fall. They see them as a gift from God.
But a group of Ugandan scientists are trying to understand more about their life cycle to see if they can be harvested in a more sustainable way.
Prof Phillip Nyeko, the lead researcher, says that apart from loss of habitat, aggressive harvesting presents another threat.
""They do not swarm to be eaten, they swarm to feed and breed. But when you put up lights and collect them in the thousands, you're upsetting their life cycle.
""You don't know if you're picking egg-laying ones, male or female. So don't be surprised if there are fewer the next season.""

Notre-Dame fire: How well prepared are UK cathedrals? - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-47952705,"Image copyright PA Image caption Firefighters in York Minster in 1984 Following the devastating fire at Notre-Dame in Paris, how well prepared are cathedrals on this side of the Channel for a fire?
""Any fire in an historic building has the potential to be devastating,"" said Becky Clark, the Church of England's director of cathedrals and church buildings.
""The priority is always to prevent fire in the first place, by using professional buildings services specialists to carry out electrical and hot works [any works that could cause fire] and having regular inspections.""
Historic buildings have to be inspected regularly just like more modern structures.
Sprinkler systems may not be suitable because they tend to be set off by heat, and in cathedrals the ceiling would be so high up that, by the time the heat triggered the sprinklers, a fire would be out of control.
Some cathedrals use what is called a sniffer system, which is designed to detect smoke in the air at an early stage so that people can be evacuated from the building.
 The Queen opened Buckingham Palace to visitors to help pay for repairs to Windsor Castle following the fire in 1992 Martin Kealy, a fire consultant and managing director of MKA Fire, says that on the whole, such buildings pose a relatively low fire risk, because most of the materials at ground level are things like stone floors and very thick timber pews, which would not easily ignite.
Things like tapestries and artwork on the walls would burn faster, but they would be unlikely to set off the fabric of the building.
That is why a point of higher risk is when renovations are being carried out, which means additional combustible materials (such as the platforms on scaffolding) and more things that could start a fire are present, and the building's fire protection systems may be temporarily offline or even removed.
People not buildings But Mr Kealy stressed that existing regulations do not necessarily focus on the historic buildings themselves.
""It should be noted that modern building regulations and fire safety standards are designed to protect people and not buildings,"" he said.
That means that any measures to protect the building would be beyond the requirements of the fire regulations.
Windsor Castle blaze recalled by firefighter on 25th anniversary Remembering the York Minster fire 30 years on In addition to the safety of staff and visitors in historic buildings, the fire regulations are also concerned with the safety of firefighters.
""We work closely with the Fire Brigade and other emergency services to ensure they have safe access to deal with any issues, including exercises to remove the cathedral's priceless artefacts to safety,"" said Jim Morley, chief constable and fire manager at Canterbury Cathedral.
Becky Clark confirmed: ""Cathedrals will have salvage lists of moveable artworks and other treasures which the Fire Brigade can work through if the site is safe enough, meaning that the most precious parts of the collections stand the best chance of being saved.""
Rising costs Even when there are not renovations under way, the roof is vulnerable to lightning strikes, as happened with the York Minster fire in 1984.
There has clearly been hefty inflation in the cost of repairing historic buildings, with the work on York Minster costing Â£2.25m (about Â£7m today) while the repairs to Windsor Castle following its 1992 fire cost Â£36.5m (about Â£74m today). The fund for repairing Notre-Dame has already passed â¬800m (Â£700m).
Image copyright PA The costs of improving fire safety at UK cathedrals is usually left to their own fundraising efforts, although several of them used money from the Â£40m First World War Centenary Cathedral Repairs Fund to pay for work to reduce the risk of fire.
The fire in Paris has prompted some MPs to warn about the risk of fire in the Palace of Westminster. They are due to move out of Parliament in 2025 to allow for renovations that are estimated to cost Â£3.6bn.

Pinterest valued at $10bn ahead of float - BBC News,www.bbc.com,Dearbail Jordan Business Reporter,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-47966614,"Image copyright Pinterest Pinterest, the online scrapbook company, has priced its shares at the top end of its range as it becomes the latest ""unicorn"" to make its stock market debut.
It will start selling its shares at $19 each , giving the loss-making firm a market value of $12.6bn (Â£9.7bn).
Pinterest is yet to make a profit and admitted in its flotation documents it may never report income.
It will begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday.
Pinterest had originally set a price range of between $15 and $17 each for its shares.
Is Uber really worth $100bn? For Uber and Lyft, reality is arriving soon How do you manage a unicorn firm? Why is Pinterest's flotation important? Pinterest's stock market listing acts as a gauge of investors' appetite for the so-called unicorns - which are private, venture capital-backed firms worth over $1bn - and comes before next month's highly-anticipated flotation of Uber, the ride sharing and delivery app.
Uber, which is loss-making, is expected to raise around $10bn and be valued at $100bn.
Lyft, Uber's smaller rival, was one of the first unicorns to float this year but since listing on the Nasdaq index in March at $72 a share its stock has dropped by more than 22%.
Other firms expected to float in 2019 included home-sharing site AirBnB and WeWork, the office provider.
Image copyright Reuters Image caption Uber is expected to be valued at $100bn when it floats in May Sales at Pinterest are growing and losses are narrowing.
Revenue has risen to $755.9m last year from $298m in 2016 while pre-tax losses have dropped to $62.5m compared to $181.8m two years ago.
However, Pinterest concedes that its business is heavily dependent on advertisers and a downturn in spending could harm its company.
It also expects to ""incur operating losses in the future and may never achieve or maintain profitability"".
What does Pinterest do? Pinterest describes itself as ""the productivity tool for planning your dreams"".

They may be looking for inspiration for a new kitchen or a new hairstyle but the common drive behind using Pinterest is commercial.
It also says that two thirds of its 250 million monthly active users are female, many of whom are mothers who ""are often the primary decision-makers when it comes to buying products and services for their household"".

India election 2019: Powerful regional parties face poll test - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-47959654," This is the second stage of a seven phase voting proess A poll official was killed in the eastern Indian state of Orissa on Thursday, hours ahead of the second stage voting in the general election.
Sanjukta Digal was on her way to a polling booth when her vehicle was attacked by Maoists, media reports say.
Orissa is one of 13 states and union territories that are voting in this stage to elect a new parliament.
Powerful regional parties are on the ballot in 97 seats, and tens of millions are eligible to vote.
Meanwhile voting has continued without much hindrance.
The eastern state of West Bengal leads the way again with the highest voter turnout - 33.4% - so far. With a turnout of around 30%, Tamil Nadu in the south and Chhattisgarh in the east are close behind. Uttar Pradesh in the north registered the lowest turnout - 24%.
Regional parties in these states are hoping to do well because they are expected to be kingmakers in this election. They dominate politics in their states and are fronted by charismatic local politicians.
 Voters in West Bengal have been thronging the booths This election is widely being seen as a referendum on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, whose Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won a historic landslide in 2014. Mr Modi will be hoping for a repeat performance.
The election is taking place over seven stages, with votes being counted on 23 May. There are 900 million eligible voters, making this the biggest election the world has ever seen.
What has happened so far? Maoists reportedly set off an explosive device in Kandhamal targeting Ms Digal's vehicle early on Thursday. She survived the blast, but was shot dead. Other officials who had been travelling with her escaped.
Elsewhere in Kandhamal, Maoists set fire to a motor bike and two cars carrying election material, but no-one was hurt.

India's Election Commission employs around five million workers to carry out the mammoth task of organising polling across the country - and this includes manning booths in sensitive areas where Maoists have long been active and carry out regular attacks.
Polling has otherwise gone smoothly. For the first time, 159 patients at the Institute of Mental health in Chennai city also voted.
As a law, everybody has the right to vote... people shouldn't be neglected just because they are inside this building,"" Dr Poorna Chandrika told BBC Tamil's Muralidharan Viswanathan.
She said hospital administrators first spoke with patients to identify those who recognised and distinguished between party logos and candidates, and understood voting procedures. And then 104 men and 55 women voted in polling booths that were set up in the hospital premises.
Some 15 million voters between the ages of 18 and 19 are newly eligible to vote in this election.
Image caption Sania Sultana voted in Bangalore ""It's a feeling that I cannot really describe. I'm feeling very happy that I was able to vote,"" Sania Sultana told BBC's Zubair Ahmed after voting for the first time.
Pooja Mahalingappa, another first-time voter said, "" I was excited to vote for the first time. I voted for my country's progress.""
Officials in some booths went all out to deck the place up and welcome voters.

And, of course, the finger is back! Every election there are a flood of images featuring smiling voters holding up their fingers.
This is because once you've cast your vote, an election official marks your index finger with indelible ink - proof that you've fulfilled your duties as a responsible citizen.
And in recent years many social media campaigns have urged people to take ""voter selfies"", all showing them proudly displaying their inked fingers.

Where are the big regional parties? The state of Tamil Nadu in particular will be closely watched as all but one of its 39 parliamentary seats go to polls on the same day. Polling in the Vellore constituency was cancelled after the election commission said it had found credible evidence of voter bribery.
The contest here is expected to be between the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) and the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) - regional parties that have dominated politics in the state for decades.
In 2014 the AIADMK, led by former chief minister Jayalalitha, swept the state - winning 37 seats. Her death in 2016, followed by the death of her regional rival M Karunanidhi, has left a vacuum in the state. Despite that, voters are still likely to choose one of these two parties.
Modi's struggle to connect with the south In the bellwether state of Uttar Pradesh (UP), which sends 80 MPs to parliament, there will be 15 seats up for grabs.
In 2014, UP played a large role in Mr Modi's landslide win - of the 282 seats the BJP won, 71 were from UP.
But this time, the party could face a tough fight. The two main regional parties - historic rivals who have both run the state - have banded together in a ""grand alliance"" to defeat Mr Modi.
 The leaders of historic regional rivals in Uttar Pradesh have banded together in an attempt to defeat Mr Modi In West Bengal, which will only see voting in two constituencies on Thursday, the state's chief minister Mamata Banerjee is hoping for a repeat of her strong 2014 performance. Her party, the Trinamool Congress (TMC), won 36 of the state's 40 seats in the last general election.
This time she is being challenged by Mr Modi's BJP, which is trying to make inroads here - the party picked up 17% of the popular vote in 2014, and won two seats.
The other states going to polls on Thursday are Assam, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jammu and Kashmir, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Manipur, Orissa, Puducherry, and Tripura.
India votes 2019 Modi The man who wants 900m votes A really simple guide to Indiaâs general election 900m voters, 39 days: 11 things about India polls Are India's election guidelines toothless? How big is this election? It is mind-bogglingly vast - about 900 million people above the age of 18 will be eligible to cast their ballots at one million polling stations. At the last election, voter turnout was about 66%.
No voter is meant to have to travel more than 2km (1.2 miles) to reach a polling station. Because of the enormous number of election officials and security personnel involved, voting is taking place in seven stages between 11 April and 19 May.
What are the key issues? Hundreds of millions of Indians have escaped poverty since the turn of the millennium, but huge challenges remain.
Under Mr Modi, the world's sixth-largest economy appears to have lost some of its momentum. Although annual GDP growth has hovered at about 7%, unemployment is a major concern.
Mr Modi's government has been accused of hiding uncomfortable jobs data. In fact, a leaked government report suggests that the unemployment rate is the highest it has been since the 1970s .
Many say Mr Modi and the BJP have polarised India in the last five years.

Income from farming has also stagnated because of a crop glut and declining commodity prices, which have left farmers saddled with debt.
Unsurprisingly, both parties have targeted the rural poor in their campaign manifestos. The BJP has promised a slew of welfare schemes for India's farmers, while the opposition Congress party has promised a minimum income scheme for the country's 50 million poorest families.
The low-caste leader taking on Indiaâs Modi Has India's government kept its promises? WhatsApp: The 'black hole' of fake news in India's election National security is also in the spotlight this election after a suicide attack by a Pakistan-based militant group killed at least 40 paramilitary police in Indian-administered Kashmir in February. India then carried out unprecedented air strikes in Pakistan.
Since then, the BJP has made national security a key plank in its campaign.

Notre-Dame fire: How new tech might help the rebuild - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-47971914,"Image caption The golden spires of the Russian Orthodox Cathedral de la Sainte-TrinitÃ© in Paris The idea that France might restore Notre-Dame inside five years causes understandable concern among those who revere the 850-year-old cathedral.
Might the rush to rebuild result in an architectural travesty?
The short answer is that new technology has been applied to preserve similarly precious monuments in France - so much so that even the repairs gained ""listed"" status in time.
What kind of tech are we talking about? Jean-Michel Wilmotte knows a thing or two about cathedrals, having just built one himself.
He is the architect of the Russian Orthodox Cathedral that recently took its place in the Parisian cityscape on the Quai Branly.
The story of the fire in graphics Why blaze was difficult to tackle Mr Wilmotte's architectural practice also restored the CollÃ¨ge des Bernardins, a gothic religious building in the French capital just a century younger than Notre Dame.
Image copyright Wilmotte & AssociÃ©s Image caption The CollÃ¨ge des Bernardins in Paris after it was restored by Jean-Michel Wilmotte To do so, it installed steel roof beams to support the custom-made new tiles.
Asked how the roof of Notre-Dame might be replaced, Mr Wilmotte suggests using a lighter structure of steel beams and titanium panels in place of the oak beams and lead sheeting that were lost.
Reims Cathedral, another French gothic masterpiece, burnt down during World War One in a disaster even greater in its magnitude than the one in Paris this week.
The architect who restored it, Henry Deneux, used a concrete frame that was innovative for its time and is now part of the building's heritage.
Could Notre-Dame be repaired to medieval standards? A 12th Century artisan turning up in 21st Century France could probably find the materials, and something like the tools, of his trade with the help of the country's Historic Monuments firms, says Christiane Schmuckle Mollard, who worked on the restoration of Strasbourg's gothic cathedral.
""Today's artisan carpenters, roofers and stone masons,"" she believes, ""do an admirable job,"" enjoying both recognition by major architects and the satisfaction that they are worthy of their ancestors.
The treasures of Notre-Dame The grief that comes from lost buildings Images show damage to cathedral's interior ""We could rebuild an identical structure for Notre-Dame because it has been perfectly documented and the materials exist,"" says Denis Dessus, president of France's National Council of the Order of Architects.
Image copyright Wilmotte & AssociÃ©s Image caption The roof of the gothic religious building, CollÃ¨ge des Bernardins in the midst of a reconstruction effort by Jean-Michel Wilmotte However, he thinks that the replacement roof is going to be a lighter, more flexible structure which will ""allow this cathedral to live for another 10 centuries"".
""In any case, this will be an object of debate because both possibilities exist, to make it identical or optimise.""
How long should the work take? French President Emmanuel Macron has called for it to be completed in five years, which would coincide with the 2024 Olympics in Paris.
Mr Wilmotte thinks that deadline is ""very easy"" and has a vision of using the River Seine to ship the materials needed for the job.
 Jean-Michel Wilmotte talks about the fire ""Wanting to tackle the problem head on is admirable,"" says Mr Dessus, but he is concerned about moving too fast with such an old building.
Only after a full examination of the site can a timescale be envisaged, he says.
""To start work for the Olympic Games would mean going very, very fast,"" he says.
Ms Schmuckle Mollard was ""startled"" to hear of President Macron's plan and suggests past French governments would simply have promised to rebuild the cathedral as it was, ""whatever the difficulties and however long the work"".
Mr Dessus reflects that ""Gothic art is demanding both technically and artistically"".
The result, though, is the ""timeless effect that grips every visitor""."

A former adviser to deposed President Omar al-Bashir, Ghazi Salahuddin Atabani, has said that Sudanese society remains divided and while he is sympathetic to the younger generations, their protests show âinexperienceâ.
âI cannot predict what is going to happen tomorrow, all I know is the politics we are practising today and the last five days is unorthodox, is unconventional and therefore you cannot draw conclusions,â he told BBC Hardtalkâs Zeinab Badawi.
Mr Atabani is now the president of the opposition group Reform Now.
Months of protests in Sudan led to the ousting and arrest of the long-time ruler Omar al-Bashir last week. Mr Bashir has now been moved to Kobar maximum security prison.

Amazon plans to shut online store in China - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-47972634," Amazon plans to shut its online store in China that allows shoppers to buy from local sellers as it downsizes operations in the country.
The firm said it would no longer run the domestic marketplace from July, but Chinese shoppers will still be able to order goods from Amazon's global store.
It will also continue to operate its cloud business in China.
The retail retreat comes as Amazon faces tough competition from local rivals Alibaba and JD.com.
Reuters first reported Amazon's plans to close its domestic marketplace in China by mid-July to focus on more lucrative businesses selling overseas goods and cloud services. Amazon's profitable cloud computing division hosts huge swathes of the corporate world on its data servers.
A spokesperson for the company said in a statement that it was ""working closely with our sellers to ensure a smooth transition and to continue to deliver the best customer experience possible"".
Consumers accessing Amazon Chinese web portal, Amazon.cn, after 18 July will see a selection of goods from its global store, Bloomberg reported.
Amazon bought Joyo.com, a Chinese books, music and video retailer, for $75m (Â£57.4m) in 2004. It rebranded the company as Amazon.cn in 2007.
But it has struggled to compete with dominant players JD.com and Alibaba's Tmall marketplace in China.

The species, dubbed ""Simbakubwa kutokaafrika"" meaning ""big African lion"" in Swahili, roamed east Africa about 20 millions years ago.
But the huge creature was part of a now extinct group of mammals called hyaenodonts.
The discovery could help explain what happened to the group.
Hyaenodonts - so called because their teeth resemble those of a modern hyena - were dominant carnivores more than 20 million years ago, National Geographic reports.
But they are not related to hyenas.

The ban includes the British National Party and Nick Griffin, the English Defence League and the National Front.
The list also includes Britain First, which was already banned, but this latest action will prohibit support for it on any of the US firm's services.
It said it had taken the action because those involved had proclaimed a ""violent or hateful mission"".
""Individuals and organisations who spread hate, or attack or call for the exclusion of others on the basis of who they are, have no place on Facebook,"" the social network added in a statement. Image copyright Facebook Image caption The pages of some organisations named were still present on Facebook before the announcement
The ban includes: The British National Party and its ex-leader Nick Griffin Britain First, its leader Paul Golding and former deputy leader Jayda Fransen English Defence League and its founding member Paul Ray Knights Templar International and its promoter Jim Dowson National Front and its leader Tony Martin Jack Renshaw, a neo-Nazi who plotted to murder a Labour MP
A spokesman for Facebook clarified what would now be done to the pages the groups and individuals had run on its site. All those named would be prevented from having a presence on any Facebook service.
In addition, praise and support for the groups or named individuals would no longer be allowed.
The ban was ""long overdue"" said MP Yvette Cooper, chair of the Home Affairs Select committee.
""For too long social media companies have been facilitating extremist and hateful content online and profiting from the poison,"" she added.
""They have particularly failed on far-right extremism as they don't even have the same co-ordination systems for platforms to work together as they do on Islamist extremism,"" she added.
Ms Cooper said the measures were a ""necessary first step"" and should be strengthened by independent regulation and financial penalties for firms that were sluggish to remove material.
""We all know the appalling consequences there can be if hateful, violent and illegal content is allowed to proliferate,"" she said. Image copyright Facebook
This current action, said Facebook, went further than the restrictions placed on Britain First last year when its official pages were removed for breaking the site's community standards.
The latest move comes soon after Facebook said it would block ""praise, support and representation of white nationalism and separatism"" on its main app and Instagram.

For nearly 140 years, from 1772 to 1911, Kolkata was the capital of British India â a bustling commercial city on the bank of the Hugli River in the heart of West Bengal. Its strategic position, roughly 150km upstream from the Bay of Bengal, not only brought foreign trade, but also enticed several foreign communities â from Chinese to Armenians to Greeks â to migrate to the thriving city. Among them were Jews from the Middle East.
Known as âBaghdadisâ or âBaghdadi Jewsâ because of their origins in modern-day Iraq, Syria and other Arabic-speaking places, Jewish immigrants began settling in Kolkata in 1798 after a trader named Shalom Cohen came in search of riches. As news spread of Cohenâs success in the trade of diamonds, silk, indigo, opium and cotton, Kolkataâs Jewish population grew rapidly, and by the early 1900s, thousands of Jews were living harmoniously alongside Kolkataâs many Hindus and Muslims. (Credit: Kalpana Prodhan) Disappearing act
After World War Two, as many as 5,000 Jews resided in Kolkata. During the communityâs peak in the 1940s, Kolkata was home to five synagogues, as well many Jewish businesses, newspapers and schools. Today, what was once Indiaâs largest Judaic community has dwindled to fewer than 24 people, as many Baghdadi Jews have immigrated to Israel, the US, Britain, Canada and Australia.
Yet, while Kolkataâs Judaic population ages and shrinks, its remaining community continues a cross-cultural tradition that has existed for the past three generations: its three remaining houses of worship are maintained and cared for by Muslim men. (Credit: Kalpana Prodhan) Family across faiths
Climbing the marble staircase and pushing past the stained glass window of Kolkataâs Beth El Synagogue, built in 1856, visitors may come across a rare sight: a team of four white-clad Muslim men busy polishing the wooden balconies, sweeping the chequered marble floors and ensuring that the Star of David and seven-pointed menorah adorning the buildingâs sand-coloured facade are clean.
Several of the caretakers, such as Siraj Khan, a third-generation Muslim employee whose family has been maintaining the synagogue for more than 120 years, have grown up alongside Beth Elâs few remaining members. According to AM Cohen, general secretary of Kolkataâs Jewish Community Affairs, Khan and the other Muslim caretakers of the cityâs synagogues are considered part of the Jewish family.

Just 300m from Beth El, one of Kolkataâs other remaining synagogues, Magen David, a towering Italian Renaissance-style red-brick building, is also maintained by four different Muslim men whose families have looked over the temple for generations. Like at Beth El, after the caretakers unlock the doors and turn on the altar lights, illuminating Hebrew inscriptions of the Ten Commandments, the workers often gather in a courtyard to unfurl a prayer rug towards Mecca and bend in prostration to Allah.
According to Jael Silliman, one of Kolkataâs last remaining Jews and author of the digital archive Recalling Jewish Calcutta , which aims to preserve the memories and legacy of the cityâs Jewish community, there has always been a cultural familiarity between Muslims and Jews in Kolkata, as the earliest Jewish immigrants to the city spoke Judeo-Arabic and wore Arabic attire.
Beyond Kolkata, the two religions have a long history of overlap. Fittingly, during the tumultuous years before and during World War Two, many European Jews fled Nazi Germany and found safe refuge in Kolkata. Like their Jewish Middle-Eastern predecessors, these newly arrived European refugees soon found that they had a lot in common with the Muslims who made up Kolkataâs largest minority group â from similarities between kosher and halal food to their music and dance.

âGod is everywhere, be it a mosque, temple, church or synagogue, and working in this quaint synagogue is a service to God that I do wholeheartedly,â said Khan (pictured), whose grandfather and father cared for the Beth El Synagogue, and who now maintains it alongside his brother.

West Bengal is home to Indiaâs third-highest concentration of Muslims, and Kolkata, its capital, has always been something of a haven for religious tolerance. While the majority of the 4.5 million population is Hindu, Muslims, Christians, Jews, Buddhists and Sikhs from across the world have long co-existed in the so-called âCity of Joyâ.
Today, itâs not uncommon in Kolkata for Hindus to join Muslims in mosques to celebrate the Eid-al-Adha âFestival of Sacrificeââ one of the holiest Islamic holidays. The Jewish Girlsâ School that was established in Kolkata in 1881 is now predominantly Muslim. And every year during the holy Hindu celebration of Durga Puja and the Christian Christmas festivities, a sea of Bengali revellers, regardless of religion, routinely take to the streets to dance.

According to AM Cohen, a few factors led to Kolkataâs Jewish population disappearing after the end of World War Two.
First, Indiaâs independence from Britain in 1947 signalled an uncertain time for Indiaâs Jews. Banks and businesses became nationalised, and many Jewish property owners, fearing their assets may be taken by the Indian government, moved to Britain or the US.
In addition, the creation of the state of Israel in 1948 spurred a steady migration of Jews from India and from around the world to the new country. (Credit: Kalpana Prodhan) Uncertain future
Today, Kolkataâs dwindling Jewish population faces a very uncertain future. While both the Beth El and Magen David synagogues are now recognised as protected heritage buildings by the Archaeological Survey of India, they â along with the cityâs oldest synagogue, Neveh Shalom â havenât held regular Saturday services since the late 1980s due to a lack of attendance. According to the Jewish minyan congregational quorum, 10 adult males must be present to sanctify public prayer, and there arenât enough Jewish men left.
In the 1940s, Ian Zachariah, treasurer of Emunah Calcutta Jewish Trust, remembers that the wooden seats at Kolkataâs synagogues used to be filled with hundreds of worshippers during the High Holidays of Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur. Now, the three buildings are only open by special appointment or by asking one of the Muslim caretakers, who are paid to look after the temples by the Emunah Calcutta Jewish Trust, to enter.
Of the 24 or so Jews who continue to live in Kolkata, most are over the age of 50 and older than their Muslim brethren who continue to maintain the synagogues. (Credit: Kalpana Prodhan) An Indian inspiration
As violence and political tension against Jews and Muslims continue to draw headlines throughout much of the world, Kolkataâs Muslim caretakers and their commitment to looking after these Jewish synagogues are a reminder that these two communities share much in common, and the importance of loving oneâs neighbour.
Kolkataâs Jewish population may soon fade away, but as long as there is someone to care for the temples, open the doors and let visitors in, a part of their heritage will live on thanks to their Muslim brothers.

Indonesia election: Widodo declares victory amid dispute - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-47978564,"Why Indonesia's next leader will need China
On Thursday, Mr Widodo told a press conference that he had won the vote with 54.5% - based on counts by 12 pollsters. Leaders from more than 20 countries had already called to congratulate him, he said.
Mr Widodo also said the quick counts of sample votes were highly accurate and that the country should ""patiently wait"" for official results.
Minutes later, Mr Prabowo told reporters his camp was declaring victory because it had ""evidence of widespread cheating at the village, sub-district and district levels across Indonesia"". He said he had won with 62% of the vote.
At the last election in 2014, Mr Prabowo also challenged results, alleged widespread fraud and declared victory after losing to Mr Widodo. The Constitutional Court upheld the result after rejecting his legal challenge.
Indonesian stocks surged on Thursday morning as investors reacted to the expectation that Mr Widodo had won a second five-year term. Why was this election unique?
This was the first time the country's presidential, parliamentary and regional elections all took place on the same day, with more than 245,000 candidates in the running for various seats.

If that was not hard enough to co-ordinate, things were further complicated by the geography of Indonesia - an archipelago of more than 17,000 islands.
Voters - including those in remote and far-flung parts of the country - had a window of only six hours to cast their ballots at one of the country's 810,000 polling stations. Who are the contenders?
Mr Widodo, 57, comes from humble beginnings - he is a former furniture salesman - and has focused past campaigns around his ""man of the people"" image.
Under his leadership the economy has grown steadily, but he has disappointed some supporters by abandoning campaign promises to resolve human rights violations. He has courted massive Chinese infrastructure investment.
Meanwhile Mr Prabowo, 67, is closely associated with the traditional political elite. Image copyright Reuters Image caption Prabowo Subianto has claimed victory despite unofficial results putting him well behind
He was previously married to the daughter of former dictator Gen Suharto, who ruled Indonesia with an iron fist for 30 years. Mr Prabowo stands accused of complicity in human rights abuses committed under Gen Suharto, but has maintained his innocence.
Despite his background, during the campaign he sought to distance himself from the political class and railed against the ""evil elites in Jakarta"". He promised to review all Chinese investment projects in Indonesia. What were the main issues?
As ever, infrastructure, corruption and the economy were all on voters' minds. But Indonesia's national identity of ""unity in diversity"" was also seen to be at stake.
Though 80% of the country is Muslim, Indonesia has no official state religion and the right to practise other faiths is enshrined in the constitution."
Venezuela crisis- The 'colectivo' groups supporting Maduro,www.bbc.com,,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-47118139,"Image copyright AFP Image caption Opponents to Mr Maduro say some of the ""colectivos"" are paramilitary groups (File photo) In this dingy building in a suburb of Caracas, Hugo ChÃ¡vez is very much alive. A statue of Venezuela's late president, dressed in military uniform, stands prominently at a corner of the main room as if welcoming everyone who enters.
Glued to the decaying wall, a picture of him smiling, printed on the yellow, blue and red colours of the national flag, looks over the table where Subero and his men spend hours in meetings.
Subero's decades-old links to ChÃ¡vez go far beyond ideology. The 47-year-old retired sergeant fought in the attempt ChÃ¡vez led on 4 February 1992 to overthrow then-President Carlos AndrÃ©s PÃ©rez. The movement failed, and Subero, ChÃ¡vez and others spent some of the following years in jail.
Subero's loyalty to his leader, however, was left unshaken.
He now leads one of the dozens of groups called colectivos, or collectives, which see themselves as the defenders of ChÃ¡vez's Bolivarian revolution and vow to defend his successor, President NicolÃ¡s Maduro, as he faces his biggest challenge yet.
The embattled leader has resisted mounting pressure to step down and call early elections while Juan GuaidÃ³, head of the opposition-controlled National Assembly, gathers international recognition after declaring himself interim president.
But Subero and many others in his colectivo , by no coincidence called 4 de Febrero, seem ready to stand up for Mr Maduro, who has been in power since 2013.
""I'm willing to fight until my death,"" says Subero. 'Foreign interference'
The colectivos emerged during ChÃ¡vez's years and, with government backing, spread across communities as social organisations supporting the implementation of official aid programmes. They are believed to have a few thousand members all around the country.
But some have been accused by the opposition and human rights groups of acting as paramilitary groups, often using force to impose their control over neighbourhoods and attack government critics, protestors and journalists. Image copyright Kevin Jordan Image caption Subero: ""I'm ready and willing to go to war""
As discontent with Mr Maduro grows, fuelled by an economy in freefall and widespread shortages of food and medicine, some fear things could turn even more violent with the armed colectivos, working alongside security forces loyal to the president, playing a key role in the streets.
At least 40 people were killed across the country in a week alone last month, according to the United Nations, with pro-government forces blamed for most of the deaths."
Venezuela crisis- Guaid sets up possible confrontation over US aid,www.bbc.com,,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-47269830,"Image copyright AFP Image caption Aid has been unloaded from US planes in Colombia and driven towards the Venezuela border Venezuela's self-declared interim leader has set up a confrontation over US aid by calling for Venezuelans to cross borders and bring it into the country next week.
Juan GuaidÃ³ wants a ""humanitarian avalanche"" and ""caravans"" to go to the borders to get the aid next Saturday.
President NicolÃ¡s Maduro says the aid is part of a US plot to disguise an invasion into Venezuela.
The US says Mr GuaidÃ³ requested aid because the country was in crisis.
USAID administrator Mark Green said children were going hungry, that nearly every hospital in Venezuela was experiencing medicine shortages and that three million people had left the country.
It remains unclear if the aid will be allowed to enter Venezuela.
US military planes have already delivered aid to the Colombian border town of Cucuta. Mr GuaidÃ³ said more aid distribution centres would be opened in the Brazilian border town of Roraima and in the Caribbean. What is GuaidÃ³ planning?
Outlining his plans for 23 February, Mr GuaidÃ³, who is leader of the opposition-controlled National Assembly, urged Venezuelans to mobilise en masse in all of the country's states.
He said aid would enter Venezuela by land and sea and also urged Venezuelans living abroad to demonstrate and for those in Colombia and Brazil to accompany the aid into Venezuela.

In an earlier tweet he said 600,000 people had signed up as volunteers to help bring in the aid and appealed to the military - which has so far remained loyal to Mr Maduro - to ""put itself on the side of the people"" and let the aid in."

Shipping magnate Evangelos Marinakis, who also owns Greek club Olympiakos, is also accused of drug trafficking and ""associating with criminals"".
Mr Marinakis, 51, is one of 28 people accused of manipulating matches, with former football federation officials and referees also charged.
He denied the charges.
""You know very well that I do not bend,"" he said.
""I have learned to be patient and at the end to justify myself with glory.""
In March last year, Mr Marinakis was cleared of forming a match-fixing ring in Greece by the Greek Supreme Court, with other related charges of blackmail and fraud also dropped.
However, prosecutors in the port city of Piraeus said he still faced ""very serious charges"" connected to a 2014 investigation into an oil tanker that was found carrying more than two tonnes of heroin.
Mr Marinakis has previously claimed to have been the ""victim of a plot"", and when he bought Nottingham Forest in 2017 , said opponents were ""jealous"" of his success with Olympiakos, who have won the Greek Super League seven times since he bought them in 2010.

Bangka Island: The WW2 massacre and a 'truth too awful to speak' - BBC News,www.bbc.com,Gary Nunn Sydney,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-47796046,"Image copyright Lynette Silver Image caption Vivian Bullwinkel was the sole female survivor of the Bangka Island massacre In 1942, a group of Australian nurses were murdered by Japanese soldiers in what came to be known as the Bangka Island massacre. Now, a historian has collated evidence indicating they were sexually assaulted beforehand - and that Australian authorities allegedly hushed it up.
""It took a group of women to uncover this truth - and to finally speak it.""
Military historian Lynette Silver is discussing what happened to 22 Australian nurses who were marched into the sea at Bangka Island, Indonesia, and shot with machine guns in February 1942. All except one were killed.
""That was a jolt to the senses enough. But to have been raped beforehand was just too awful a truth to speak,"" Ms Silver says, speaking of claims she details in a new book.
""Senior Australian army officers wanted to protect grieving families from the stigma of rape. It was seen as shameful. Rape was known as a fate worse than death, and was still a hangable offence [for perpetrators] in New South Wales until 1955.""
The survivor The Japanese soldiers had separated men and women on Bangka Island before shooting both groups out of sight of the other.
Nurse Vivian Bullwinkel was shot in the massacre but survived by playing dead. She hid in the jungle and was taken as a prisoner of war, before eventually returning to Australia. Of the small group of men who were massacred, two are known to have survived: Ernest Lloyd and Eric Germann.
Image copyright Getty Bangka Island lies off Sumatra in the Indonesian archipelago Ms Bullwinkel was ""gagged"" from speaking about the rapes at the Tokyo war crimes tribunal in the aftermath of World War Two, according to Ms Silver, who researched an account Ms Bullwinkel gave to a broadcaster before she died in 2000.
""She was following orders,"" Ms Silver says. ""In addition to the taboo, there was probably some guilt from the Australian government - senior officers knew Japanese troops had raped and murdered British nurses when the Japanese invaded Hong Kong in 1942, but were tardy in calls to evacuate the Australian nurses from Singapore.""
According to the Australian government, the perpetrators of the massacre remain unknown and ""escaped any punishment for their crime"".
An Australian Defence Force spokesperson says a decision on whether a new investigation into these sexual assault claims will commence is up to the government, but that ""new historic allegations can be reported by family"" to a unit which investigates such crimes.
Image copyright Lynetee Silver Image caption Nurses who were not present during this incident on Bangka Island arrive in Singapore from prisoner of war camps in 1942 Investigating what happened The other women whose work has revealed evidence of these alleged sexual assaults are broadcaster Tess Lawrence and biographer Barbara Angell.
Ms Angell did forensic work into the mismatching thread and bullet holes in Ms Bullwinkel's nurse's uniform.
It indicated that buttons had been ripped off her bodice and sewn on in a different colour thread (after her death, when it was put on display), and the only way the bullet entry and exit holes lined up was if her bodice was open at the waist and down at the front.
Ms Lawrence reported in 2017 that, before she died, Ms Bullwinkel confided in her that ""most of"" the nurses were ""violated"" before being shot, and that she'd wanted to reveal this but couldn't - a secret, she said, that ""tortured"" her.
Image copyright Lynette Silver Image caption Bullet holes in Vivian Bullwinkel's nurse's uniform The Australian historian also cites an account of a Japanese soldier who was being treated for malaria nearby on Bangka Island, which is off Sumatra. He told an Australian investigating officer that he heard screams and was told soldiers were ""pleasuring themselves on the beach and it'd be the turn of platoon next"".
In addition, Ms Silver discovered that part of a page detailing what happened to the nurses in a key account had been ripped out, in what she believes was an act of censorship.
War memorabilia stolen from man in 90s WW2 codebreaking machine reconstructed Veteran gets to wear bearskin for birthday The account was by Jean Williams, wife of Major Harold Williams, about investigations he conducted for the Australian War Crimes Section.
Image copyright Lynette Silver Image caption A passage of Jean Williams' historical account was removed Peter Stanley, a military history professor at University of New South Wales, says Ms Silver's account doesn't surprise him: ""I've been waiting for this story to come out - it has been alleged for years, including by ex-servicewomen who knew Vivian Bullwinkel and told me. It correlates with on-the-record sexual assaults by Japanese WW2 soldiers in Hong Kong, the Philippines and Singapore.""
The army's 'darlings' Before the massacre, Ms Silver says the Australian nurses had ""a carefree, happy life"" in Singapore until the end of 1941.
""They were wined and dined - the darlings of the army,"" she says. ""They were just dealing with the usual complaints you get in army peacetime - accidents in training, car accidents, malaria.""
When the Japanese attacked on 8 December 1941 - a few hours before Pearl Harbor - their lives changed, she says: ""They were overwhelmed with battle casualties. Even houses in Singapore were transformed into hospitals.""
Ms Silver says she sees it as important to speak the ""unsanitised truth"" that Vivian Bullwinkel had wanted to tell in 1945 and 1946.
""If I didn't tell this secret, I'd be part of the culture of silence and the government clampdown, and protecting the perpetrators,"" she says. ""These nurses deserve to have their story told - that's their justice.""
She has recently received emails from people who personally knew the nurses. ""I was slightly concerned people might say I should let sleeping dogs lie, but I haven't received a single derogatory remark,"" she says.
Ms Silver now wants the Australian War Memorial (AWM), which already includes the story of the massacre, to tailor its tours to include this account of the alleged sexual assaults.
AWM director Dr Brendan Nelson tells the BBC: ""We don't deny or downplay these allegations; indeed, it's known rape and sexual assault are used as weapons in war. Nevertheless, as the sole survivor the incident, Lt Col Bullwinkel, passed away nearly 20 years ago, we do not, nor can ever categorically know what took place.""
#MeToo comparison Ms Silver draws parallels with the #MeToo movement: ""The same social mores are at play - whereby women felt compelled to wait before they could say anything. As victims, they're made to feel responsible. I think #MeToo would've given Vivian Bullwinkel the confidence to finally speak up.""
Image copyright Lynette Silver Image caption Lynette Silver has won awards for her work as a ""historical detective"" ""Female history writers are generally more interested in the human element than how many guns there were. As a female, you have empathy.""
She said it was revealing that it was three female historians who uncovered the evidence for this story: ""I've heard of history being told as 'his-story'. This was the opposite of that."""
Trump 'tried to fire Mueller' - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-47983489,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Why no charge of obstruction of justice? A law professor breaks down the legal questions. US President Donald Trump tried to get the man appointed to investigate his links to Russia fired, a long-awaited report has revealed.
The 448-page redacted document, collated by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, was finally released on Thursday.
Mr Trump's legal team has described the report as a ""total victory"".
But the country's top lawyer, William Barr, is facing heavy criticism of his handling of the report's release.
Senior Democrats have accused the attorney general of ""misleading"" them with an earlier summary of the report's findings regarding whether Mr Trump obstructed justice.
The mammoth document is the product of a 22-month investigation by Mr Mueller - who was appointed to probe Russian interference in the 2016 election and possible collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign.
Reaction to the Mueller report as it happened What's new in the Mueller report? Pro-Trump Santas and other Mueller oddities The Trump-Russia saga in 350 words His team's investigation has led to 35 people being charged, including several who were a part of the president's campaign and administration.
What does the report reveal? Mr Mueller's report says he found no criminal conspiracy between Mr Trump's campaign and Russia, but could not reach a concrete legal conclusion on whether Mr Trump tried to obstruct the investigation.
""If we had confidence after a thorough investigation of the facts that the president clearly did not commit obstruction of justice, we would so state,"" the report says. ""Based on the facts and the applicable legal standards, we are unable to reach that judgement.
""Accordingly, while this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.""
The report says that in June 2017, Mr Trump called Don McGahn - then a White House lawyer - to try to get Mr Mueller removed over alleged ""conflicts of interest"".
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption US Attorney General William Barr on Mueller report findings Mr McGahn told the special counsel he resigned after feeling ""trapped because he did not plan to follow the President's directive"" and would not have known what to say to Mr Trump had he called again.
The report also reveals:
Mr Trump reportedly used an expletive when the investigation was announced, adding: ""Oh my god. This is terrible. This is the end of my presidency"" Mr Mueller examined 10 actions by the president in regards to obstruction of justice, which he said largely ""took place in public view"" The report says that potential obstruction of justice by the president only failed because members of his administration, including former FBI Director James Comey, refused to ""carry out orders"" Investigators viewed the president's written responses to their questions as ""inadequate"" but chose not to pursue a potentially lengthy legal battle to interview him Mr Trump dictated a misleading response as to what the June 2016 meeting between Russian intermediaries and Trump campaign officials in Trump Tower was about - this had earlier been denied by Mr Trump's lawyer and White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders The special counsel considered charging the president's son, Donald Trump Jr, and son-in-law Jared Kushner but did not think they could meet the Department of Justice's burden of proof that they wilfully broke the law Read more on the new findings Why no charges for Trump? Robert Mueller has said that the written answers provided by Donald Trump were inadequate, but if that's the case, why didn't he use his subpoena powers to demand the president come before his investigating committee and answer questions directly?
That was an arm wrestle he chose not to get into with the president for fear that it may lead to the permanent death of his investigation.
So he ducked that one.
Others may ask: ""Well, if you thought there was a level of obstruction why didn't you say there should be an indictment?""
I'd say what he's done here - to use an American analogy - is he's taken the baseball bat, he's put it on home plate and he's leaving it for other people to pick up and take a swing.
He's saying to Congress essentially: ""I've looked at it. I didn't resolve this question. I didn't exonerate him. But if you want to have a go, that's a different thing.""

In one tweet, he said had the right to ""end the whole witch hunt"" and fire Mr Mueller had he wanted to.
How are the Democrats responding? Representative Jerry Nadler confirmed that the House Committee on the Judiciary had already requested the special counsel to appear ""as soon as possible"".
Senior Democrats have called on Mr Mueller to testify to them directly in order to ""restore public trust"" after what they described as Mr Barr's ""partisan behaviour"" regarding the report.
The attorney general, who was appointed by Mr Trump, held a news conference before the report was made public in which he backed the president.

""I should note that at a technological innovations exhibition, the main hero was me, robot Alex,"" he said, with a smile, when presenting a segment about an artificial intelligence conference in Moscow.
But an item that appeared to have all the hallmarks of a smear against opposition activist Ilya Yashin was criticised.
""Meet Rossiya 24's new anchor, robot Alex. Artificial intelligence, a talent for propaganda and an integrated fake news generator is available right in your box,"" one viewer said on Twitter.
Others mocked Alex's slightly rough appearance and clothes, his off-focus gaze and awkward facial expressions.
""Alex, if they are holding you hostage and force you to drink alcohol, wink three times when you go on the air!"" urged a viewer online.
One viewer took a shine to Alex and said he was a ""very nice robot"" while another said his deployment was ""an interesting trend"".
Most observers think on-air Alex is a temporary stunt to inject some fun and promote innovative Russian technology in TV news.
""For the first time a robot appeared as a news presenter on TV channel Rossiya 24,"" the channel said on its website.
""It is for TV viewers to decide how he performed. Could robots replace journalists?"" it asked.

Viewpoint: Beyonceâs Homecoming celebrates black culture and education - BBC News,www.bbc.com,Barrett Holmes Pitner Contributor,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-47982033," Image caption Beyonce's new documentary features Quote: s and audio from black leaders and intellectuals BeyoncÃ©'s Netflix documentary Homecoming is much more than a film about the first black woman to headline the Coachella music festival.
It is a celebration of black American culture with education, specifically Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), serving as the foundation of her message.
In the film, BeyoncÃ© describes how she always wanted to attend an HBCU, but Destiny's Child and the trials and tribulations of celebrity instead became her higher education.
""She did not attend an HBCU, but she has learned from and mimicked the culture that's present at HBCUs,"" said Dawn Williams, the Dean of Howard University's School of Education.
""[BeyoncÃ©'s] naming the film Homecoming is quite illustrative of what it feels like. I saw examples of what we experience here at homecoming. Homecoming is not just for alumni, or returning students. It is a community event. You'll find a multitude of many different kinds of people there.""
Regardless of whether you are a celebrated artist like BeyoncÃ©, or a fan who watched Homecoming on Netflix, you can attend an HBCU homecoming and likewise have the opportunity to receive an education from some of the African diaspora's greatest minds.
 Image caption Beyonce was the first black woman to headline Coachella music festival Throughout Homecoming, BeyoncÃ© included Quote: s and audio from black leaders and intellectuals, and I greatly appreciated the Quote: she used from W.E.B. Du Bois: ""Education must not simply teach work - it must teach life.""
This Quote: was radical and empowering over 100 years ago, and for better or worse it still leaves a lasting impact today. The Quote: is from Du Bois' ""Talented Tenth"" essay in 1903 that both articulated his vision of higher education for black people, and served as a stern rebuke to his rival Booker T Washington who advocated for blacks to prioritise industrial and agrarian training.
The story of historically black colleges in the US In the late 19th Century, Washington was the most popular black man in America, and was the first black man formally invited to the White House for dinner.
Washington's fame largely grew from his Atlanta Compromise speech in 1895 that urged black people to leave higher education to the white man, and instead focus on manual labour and learning a trade.
Du Bois' ideas prevailed, and it is troubling to imagine how bleak and oppressive American society might be today if Washington had won this debate.
Du Bois' ideas soon thereafter gave birth to the Niagara Movement in 1905, which became the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in 1909.
Without the NAACP, and other organisations and individuals that espoused Du Bois' vision, there might not have been a civil rights movement in the 1960s, and who knows when Jim Crow might have ended.
BeyoncÃ© also plays audio of Malcolm X passionately describing the unenviable plight of black women in America.
 Image caption Quote: s from Malcolm X, pictured here speaking at a rally, are featured in the new documentary ""The most disrespected person in America is the black woman. The most unprotected woman in America is the black woman. The most neglected woman in America is the black woman.""
As a black man in America, I grew up learning about Du Bois, Malcolm X, and countless other black male leaders, so their inclusion reminded me of my childhood.
Du Bois was the intellectual, and Malcolm was the defender; and as men, if we aspire to use our intellect and strength to combat racism we cannot overlook the necessity of dismantling patriarchal oppression with equal vigour.
Working to elevate female voices and ensure that young girls have an abundance of female role models remains an essential feature of black empowerment, and I appreciated the diversity of female voices that BeyoncÃ© used.
Everything we know about BeyoncÃ©'s Homecoming film and album The black power behind 'iconic' Beychella BeyoncÃ©'s selection of writer, activist, feminist Audre Lorde's Quote: ""Without community, there is no liberation,"" is an astute and provocative choice because it tackles both racial and gender oppression.
At first glance, the Quote: speaks to the strength and resilience of America's black community and our constant struggle to liberate ourselves from the oppression of systemic racism in America; but it also speaks to the importance of inclusion, diversity, and representation.
This Quote: came from Lorde's speech ""The Master's Tools Will Never Dismantle the Master's House"", which Lorde gave at an international conference celebrating Simone de Beauvoir's The Second Sex, and she used her platform to denounce the conference's and the feminist movement's lack of diversity and marginalisation of women of colour.
""You can't be what you can't see,"" said Marian Wright Edelman, a 1959 graduate of Spelman College, and the founder of the Children's Rights Fund who was also Quote: d in the film.
BeyoncÃ© bookends her film with Quote: s from authors Toni Morrison and Maya Angelou, and their wisdom has always gracefully empowered our community, celebrated our humanity, and provided a richness to our struggle for equality that the world needs to hear.
 Image caption Maya Angelou was described by Barack Obama as ""one of the brightest lights of our time"" ""What I really want to do is be a representative of my race, of the human race. I have a chance to show how kind we can be. How intelligent and generous we can be,"" said Angelou.
The significance of Homecoming also is not merely about the celebrated African Americans featured in the film, or the behind the scenes look at how BeyoncÃ© prepared for the concert; but is also about the foundational importance education has always held in the black community.
Prior to the Civil War it was illegal to educate black people in most parts of the South, but following the Emancipation Proclamation and during Reconstruction, black families spent nearly half of their income on education.
The American government did not actively fund these institutions to black education, so newly-freed African Americans pooled their money together to build schools. They worked with affluent white allies to build gleaming, new beacons of higher learning; and many HBCUs still bear the name of the white man who had the money to build it.
Educating African Americans has never been a priority in American society, but it has always been the foundation of black culture in America.
Homecoming displayed the beauty of black culture, and gave people the chance to celebrate the necessity of black education.

Canada avalanche: Three professional climbers believed killed in Rockies - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-47901708,"Image copyright EyeWire Image caption Banff National Park stands in the Canadian Rockies Three professional climbers are presumed dead after an avalanche in the Canadian Rockies, authorities say.
The three mountaineers were attempting to scale Howse Peak and failed to check in on schedule.
National park staff flew over the area where they were climbing and saw evidence of ""avalanches and debris containing climbing equipment"".
Recovery efforts are on hold because of dangerous conditions and additional avalanches at the scene.
Those efforts are likely to be further hampered by bad weather in the coming days.
Outdoor clothing company The North Face has identified the men as David Lama and Hansjoerg Auer from Austria, and Jess Roskelley, from the US.
The three were sponsored by the firm which said in a statement it was doing everything it could to support their families, friends and the climbing community.
The climbers went missing when they were attempting to scale the east side of Howse Peak, which Parks Canada described as a ""remote and an exceptionally difficult objective, with mixed rock and ice routes requiring advanced alpine mountaineering skills"".
The route taken by the climbers was rarely traversed, safety specialist Steve Holeczi said during a press conference.
Mr Holeczi, who was among those who flew over the avalanche site, estimated the avalanche to be strong enough to destroy a small building.
Howse Peak, with a 3,295 metre (10,800 foot) elevation, is in the Canadian province of Alberta, in Banff National Park.
Who are the men? Mr Roskelley, 36, from Spokane, Washington state, scaled Mount Everest at age 20.
The son of a famous mountaineer, he was the youngest American to reach the summit of the world's highest peak in 2003.

Mr Lama, 28, is also from a climbing family - his father was a mountain guide from Nepal - and his talent was recognised at an early age.
He won numerous climbing competitions as a teenager.
In 2014, a film was released that documented his attempt to become the first person to free-climb the Compressor Route on Patagonia's Cerro Torre mountain.

Mueller report: A president saved from himself - BBC News,www.bbc.com,Jon Sopel North America Editor,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-47982156,"These are external links and will open in a new window Close share panel Image copyright Getty/Win McNamee Image caption Attorney General William Barr takes questions about the release of the redacted version of the Mueller Report at the Department of Justice April 18, 2019 in Washington, DC Lengthy reports on politics tend to be as dry as dust; a perfect cure for insomniacs; a turn on for political obsessives and a total turn off for those with normal lives to lead. 'Sorry darling, I can't come in for dinner now I'm reading appendix 6, paragraph 4 subsection 2 of this really gripping report.'
Well my friends, the Mueller report really is a page turner, full of juicy revelations and intriguing tidbits of palace intrigue. Its portrayal of life inside the West Wing a couple of years back is riveting. It is a place teetering out of control, with a succession of top advisors choosing to ignore the wishes of an increasingly angry president. There are so many fantastic vignettes.
But the report wasn't meant to entertain the American people - though it does, or would do if anyone chose to read it. It was meant to inform them on two key questions - whether there was collusion between the Russians and the Trump campaign - Mueller finds there wasn't. And whether the president obstructed justice in trying to impede investigation of the Russia question - on that he is a good deal more nuanced - he found ten separate incidents where there might have been.
And it is here we come to my key question, which is ultimately political and not legalistic - will it change any minds? Image copyright Getty/Drew Angerer Image caption Democrats are expected to use the report to thwart Mr Trump's 2020 campaign
I suspect that if you are a Trump supporter you will say: ""There was no action of illegality, the president was right all along, it's all been a hoax and a witch hunt, there's nothing to see ladies and gentlemen so please move along.""
If you are someone who believes that Donald Trump was always unfit to hold office, you were reaffirmed in that view and say: ""Is the bar really being set at a level where - provided nothing illegal happened - well that's alright then?""
So those are the two polarised positions.
Congress will certainly want to look much further at this, given all the revealing tales of politics at the White House. What's new in the Mueller report?
And on this key question of obstruction of justice, I think the key quote is this: Donald Trump's attempts at influencing the investigation ""were mostly unsuccessful but that is largely because the persons who surrounded the president declined to carry out orders or accede to his requests"".
In other words, it looks like the team that muttered under their collective breath ""I'm ignoring you, Mr President"", saved him from himself. If they had carried out his orders to arrange for the firing of Mueller then the obstruction of justice piece might be a lot clearer - and not in a way that Donald Trump would want.
So where does this leave Bob Mueller? The former FBI director and Vietnam War veteran may face some tough questions when he goes before that congressional committee.
He has said that the written answers provided by Donald Trump were inadequate, but if that's the case, why didn't he use his subpoena powers to demand the president come before his investigating committee and answer questions directly? Image copyright Getty/Alex Wong Image caption Special counsel Robert Mueller has been asked to testify in front of a congressional committee
That was an arm wrestle that Bob Mueller chose not to get into with the president for fear that it may lead to the permanent death of his investigation.
So he ducked that one.
Other many ask: ""Well, if you thought there was a level of obstruction why didn't you say there should be an indictment?""
I'd say what he's done here - to use an American analogy - is he's taken the baseball bat, he's put it on home plate and he's leaving it for other people to pick up and take a swing.
He's saying to Congress essentially: ""I've looked at it. I didn't resolve this question. I didn't exonerate him. But if you want to have a go, that's a different thing.""
Remember there are different legal thresholds for indictment (ie a criminal charge) and an impeachment which is a largely political process that would have to be done by a divided Congress. Image copyright Getty/Win McNamee Image caption Democratic Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi has shown caution in pursuing impeachment, a route that cost Republicans in the 1990s
Before he goes before Congress he'll need to be able to answer this key question: ""You dodged the question and didn't resolve what you were meant to resolve"".
I think that the wider game - (maybe that's too glib a word to use, so I'll say strategy here) - the wider strategy of the Democrats is that they would like to see a president going into 2020 a bit wounded, a bit weakened, his name tarnished by the Mueller investigation and who will be easier to strike out in a presidential election.
The danger of going down the impeachment route, which is the most dramatic way of picking up that baseball bat, is that all that it results in is uniting the Republican party. Just look at Bill Clinton's approval ratings after Republican's impeached him. If he had been able to stand for a re-election, he would have romped home according to the polls at the time.
Then as now it would probably lead to a good many independent voters thinking: ""This is all becoming ghastly and political, mean-minded, mean-spirited and nothing to do with justice, but only about political point scoring."" How easy is it to impeach a president?
For that reason I think the Democratic leadership - for all the subpoenas, for all the demands for people and papers to be served up to the various committees - would much rather knock the president around a bit than go down a route which would almost certainly end in failure and almost certainly be counter-productive.
And for all the questions, doubts, contradictions, sleights of hand, Donald Trump emerges with two key headlines: Mueller says there was no collusion; the Attorney General says there was no obstruction of justice.
Game over, as Donald Trump declared on Twitter.
No wonder White House are describing the president as ""jacked"". "

Pet insurance payouts hit record of Â£785m - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-19-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-47981954," Payouts by pet insurers hit a record Â£785m in 2018, even though the number of claims submitted fell, according to the industry trade body.
The Association of British Insurers (ABI) said this was down to the higher cost of increasingly sophisticated medical care.
The size of the average claim jumped by Â£36, or nearly 5%, to Â£793.
The ABI said the ""overwhelming majority"" of pet insurance payouts were to meet veterinary treatment bills.
Less common claims included pet owners asking to be reimbursed for the theft of a pet, the cost of advertising to find a lost animal, as well as liability for when a pet damaged property or injured someone.
However, the ABI says these claims were ""tiny"" compared with veterinary treatment bills.
Senior policy adviser for pet insurance, Joe Ahern, said: ""There is no NHS for animals, so if you've not got a pet policy in place, you risk having to foot veterinary bills out of your own pocket.
""These can often be in the thousands of pounds and vet treatment is only getting more expensive, not less.""
The rise of the dog-napper Dog with seizures costs Â£30,000 to treat The size of the average claim on pet insurance jumped by Â£36, or 4.75%, to Â£793 between 2017 and 2018.
However, the number of claims submitted fell to 990,000, down from 1.02 million the previous year.
Total payouts increased by Â£10m to Â£785m - a rise of 1.3%.
Image copyright Thinkstock Nearly 4.3 million pets were covered by insurance last year, more than ever before, and an increase of 50,00 on 2017
But the ABI said there was still a ""worrying level of under-insurance"" among cat owners.
There are thought to be 7.5 million cats in UK homes, but only 1.3 million are insured, whereas 2.8 million dogs are insured out of an estimated 8.5 million pet pooches.
Average premiums fell slightly for the first time in eight years - down from Â£281 in 2017 to Â£279 in 2018. This is the first time there has been any decrease in pet premiums for eight years.
Over the past ten years, the average claim has increased by 75%, whilst the average premium has only increased by 50%, according to the ABI.

I was terrified - he was obviously in pain, whining, tired and lethargic.
The vet recommended he stay in for the day, have some X-rays, an intravenous drip and painkillers. She got out her calculator, did a few sums and asked: ""Is Â£1,600 okay?""
I thought for a second she had said Â£160, which I thought was a bit steep. When reality dawned, I nearly needed to be revived myself.
Luckily, we have pet insurance, which pays 90% of our vet bills. But Bertie has had at least three treatments for meningitis, including stays in hospital and is still on medication.
Even just 10% of the cost of all that is eye-watering, but he is still worth every penny."

But while some have been wrestling with the grave political and constitutional questions the report raises the 448-page redacted document had lighter moments too. Here's the best of them. Mueller disputed fees at a Trump golf course
In the days following the appointment of Special Counsel Robert Mueller to investigate accusations of collusion with Russia, the president aired concerns to his inner circle, including then-Chief Strategist Steve Bannon, that there were conflicts of interest.
These included that Mr Mueller had interviewed for the FBI Director position shortly before his appointment and that he had worked for a law firm that represented people affiliated with the president.
However, the third and final concern was more bizarre as Mr Trump claimed that Mr Mueller had ""disputed certain fees relating to his membership in a Trump golf course in northern Virginia"".
Mr Bannon is said to have rejected all three claims, in particular calling the golf course dispute ""ridiculous and petty"". Russians paid people to dress like Santa in Trump masks
Mr Mueller investigated whether Russia's Internet Research Agency (IRA) was exploiting political divisions in the United States on the request of Mr Trump.
Mr Mueller writes that he could not ""identify evidence that any US persons knowingly or intentionally coordinated"" with the IRA. The Trump-Russia saga in 350 words
However, there was evidence presented of US rallies organized by the Russian agency involving some colourful tactics.
""The IRA also recruited moderators of conservative social media groups to promote IRA-generated content, as well as recruited individuals to perform political acts (such as walking around New York City dressed up as Santa Claus with a Trump mask)."" 'Lawyers don't take notes'
The report describes Mr Trump scolding White House counsel Donald McGahn for taking notes in meetings with the special counsel's office investigators.
""The President then asked, 'What-about these notes? Why do you take notes? Lawyers don't take notes. I never had a lawyer who took notes.' McGahn responded that he keeps notes because he is a 'real lawyer' and explained that notes create a record and are not a bad thing,"" it states.
The president is then quoted as saying ""I've had a lot of great lawyers, like Roy Cohn. He did not take notes.""
Roy Cohn assisted Senator Joseph McCarthy's attempts to expose US communists in the 1950s before going on to work for Mr Trump as he launched his business career. Top legal official always carried a resignation letter
The report offers insight into the strained relationship between Mr Trump and his first attorney general, Jeff Sessions.
The president criticised Mr Sessions both privately and publicly, and called upon him to regain control of the investigation.
The friction between the two reached a point where Mr Sessions was ready to quit at a moment's notice, the report says.
""In light of the President's frequent public attacks, Sessions prepared another resignation letter and for the rest of the year carried it with him in his pocket every time he went to the White House,"" the report says. Related Topics "

They want Robert Mueller, the man who collated the report, to publicly testify before congress about the work he has done.
It comes after a redacted version of the document was released on Thursday.
Mr Trump's legal team has said it completely exonerates the president.
But while the report does say the president did not collude with the Russians, it did not come to a firm conclusion on the issue of obstruction of justice.
It also reveals several occasions when Mr Trump tried to hinder the investigation itself - including attempting to have Mr Mueller removed.
The 448-page redacted document is the result of a 22-month investigation by Mr Mueller, who was appointed to investigate alleged Russian interference in the 2016 election and possible collusion with the Trump campaign.
What's in the report? Mr Mueller's report says he found no criminal conspiracy between Mr Trump's campaign and Russia, but could not reach a concrete legal conclusion on whether Mr Trump tried to obstruct the investigation.
""If we had confidence after a thorough investigation of the facts that the president clearly did not commit obstruction of justice, we would so state,"" the report says. ""Based on the facts and the applicable legal standards, we are unable to reach that judgement.

This is terrible. This is the end of my presidency"" Mr Mueller examined 10 actions by the president in regards to obstruction of justice, which he said largely ""took place in public view"" The report says that potential obstruction of justice by the president only failed because members of his administration refused to ""carry out orders"" Investigators viewed the president's written responses to their questions as ""inadequate"" but chose not to pursue a potentially lengthy legal battle to interview him What do Democrats say? Democrat congressional leaders Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer in a joint statement said the report painted a ""disturbing picture of a president who has been weaving a web of deceit, lies and improper behaviour"".

Image Copyright @RepJerryNadler @RepJerryNadler Report Image Copyright @RepJerryNadler @RepJerryNadler Report Democrats have also attacked US Attorney-General William Barr, accusing him of ""misleading"" them with an earlier summary of the report's findings regarding whether Mr Trump obstructed justice.
Mr Barr held a news conference before the report was made public in which he backed the president.
The report has long been viewed as a potential tool to impeach the president but the House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said this would not be ""worthwhile at this point"".
""Very frankly, there is an election in 18 months and the American people will make a judgement,"" he told CNN.
What's the Democrat game plan? I think that the wider strategy of the Democrats is that they would like to see a president going into 2020 a bit wounded, a bit weakened.
The danger of going down the impeachment route is that all that it results in is uniting the Republican party.
For that reason I think the Democratic leadership would much rather knock the president around a bit than go down a route which would almost certainly end in failure and almost certainly be counter-productive.
And for all the questions, doubts, contradictions, sleights of hand, Mr Trump emerges with two key headlines: Mueller says there was no collusion; the attorney-general says there was no obstruction of justice.

China bans three marathon cheat runners for life - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-19-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-47985622,"Image copyright Reuters Image caption Runners competing at the Boston Marathon on Monday, 15 April Three Chinese marathon runners have been banned from competing for life after breaking the rules at the Boston Marathon on Monday.
One participant gave his bib to someone else while the other two used forged certificates to gain entry.
The Chinese Athletic Association (CAA) has vowed to root out cheats to avoid giving the country a bad name.
The sport is rapidly growing in China, with 1,500 running events last year compared to just 22 in 2011.
More than 500 Chinese runners took part in the marathon in Boston.
With the increase in popularity there have been numerous cases of cheating, such as people taking shortcuts and one woman jumping on a bike to complete a portion of a race in China.
The CAA said it banned the trio from all future races because they had a ""negative impact"" on China in the international community.
The Xinhua news agency said the sporting association would continue to crack down on all kinds of cheats in marathons ""in order to build a healthy and clean environment of road running in China"".

Climate protests: How do police control demonstrations? - BBC News,www.bbc.com,Reality Check Team Bbc News,04-19-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-47965614,"Image copyright Getty Images Some 400 climate-change protesters have been arrested after several days of demonstrations in central London.
Despite the arrests, the Extinction Rebellion activists say they will continue with their protests, which have caused traffic gridlock in places and disruption to parts of London's public transport network.
Policing of the protests has been criticised by some, but what powers do officers have? And how have their tactics changed from previous protests? What powers are the police using?
The majority of the arrests by the Metropolitan Police Service, have been for suspected breaches of a Section 14 Notice of the Public Order Act 1986 .
A ""Section 14"" is a ""direction"" that allows the police to impose conditions on a static protest - in other words, one where a group of people gather in one place and stay put - rather than marching somewhere. Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Who are Extinction Rebellion?
In relation to the Extinction Rebellion protests, the Met has stipulated that activists should move to nearby Marble Arch if they wish to continue protesting. Extinction Rebellion: Charges over climate change train protest
If individuals fail to follow the police instructions, they can be arrested and face the risk of criminal prosecution.
The most likely sentence for breaching a Section 14 notice, especially if the convicted person was peaceful and has no recent convictions for similar offences, is a conditional discharge - where a court convicts but does not impose a sentence on the condition a further offence isn't committed. When are the police allowed to issue a Section 14 notice?
Section 14 notices are quite rarely used, but they can be when police have advance notice of a big protest.
Police officers can issue them if they ""reasonably believe"" that the protest ""may result in serious public disorder, serious damage to property or serious disruption to the life of the community"". They can also be be used if the police believe the purpose of the protest is to intimidate others. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The Commissioner of the Met, Cressida Dick, has been briefing the home secretary about the protests
But protesters need to be aware that police have issued a Section 14 direction in respect of the protest before they can be arrested for a suspected breach.
Police will often try to communicate that a Section 14 notice is in force through various means - for example, handing out leaflets, using social media or using a megaphone to address a crowd. But why isn't everyone being arrested?
Officers have discretion over whether to make arrests. The Met said in a statement: ""These are peaceful protesters; while disruptive their actions are not violent towards police, themselves or other members of the public. We are looking at other tactics such as tighter police cordons.""
In any protest, the police might take the view that attempting to carry out mass arrests could cause trouble - so by ""waiting it out"" they hope that the demonstrations might gradually wind down of their own accord.
There is also a question of resources. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption One activist, Farhana Yamin, glued her own hands to the pavement outside Shell's headquarters
One police officer at one of the protest spots told the BBC their tactic was to move people one-by-one.
The officer added that while everyone was ""technically arrestable"", there were not enough officers to carry out mass arrests.
Furthermore, there have been reports of some of those arrested being sent as far as Bromley, south London, due to a lack of police cells in central London.
According to a 2017 Freedom of Information request, the Met has 683 cells across 27 custody suites .
In response to concerns over capacity, the Met said it had ""contingency plans"" should cells become too crowded but refused to discuss its plans further for ""operational reasons"". How do the police tactics compare with previous protests?
On May Day in 2000, the Metropolitan Police Service was accused of losing control of Westminster and the West End during a major anti-capitalism protest .
There were running battles between officers and anarchist groups which led to significant damage.
The following year, when some of the same groups returned, the Met responded in force.
Thousands of officers used a tactic known as ""kettling"" to corral crowds until they were trapped in what amounted to a human pen at the very same Oxford Circus location now occupied by Extinction Rebellion.
Some of the protesters turned violent - but many others were entirely peaceful and angry at being ""kettled"" and unable to leave.
Police identified the ""trouble-makers"" and sent in snatch squads to arrest them. It took seven hours for the city to return to normal and the crowds to be dispersed.
Kettling became the subject of an 11-year legal battle, which resulted in the European Court of Human Rights declaring that it was lawful .
That landmark judgement meant the police could use this exceptional containment power if there was a genuine risk of violence.
In 2005, more than 350 people were arrested at the Gleneagles G8 leaders' summit in Scotland following violent clashes between protesters and police.
Extinction Rebellion is different because there is no threat of violence - just occupation and disruption, aided by DJs, mobile curry stalls and the occasional juggler. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The 2019 Extinction Rebellion protest has focused on occupation and disruption rather than violence associated with previous demonstrations So do the police have other tactics?
In 2009, demonstrations against the UK meeting of G20 world leaders saw both peaceful and sporadically violent protests in London.
Climate Camp, one of the peaceful demos, was similar to Extinction Rebellion. It was a sudden, no-notice occupation of a part of the City of London - home of the Bank of England and other financial institutions - which police couldn't stop.
By early evening, the Met's commander on the ground was concerned there was going to be trouble - not from the Climate Campers, but from the dispersal of another nearby group which he feared could infiltrate the peaceful street occupation.
His officers issued Section 14 orders telling the Climate Campers to depart by 19:00. When they failed to leave, he contained them while his officers dealt with the other group.
What happened next deepened the controversy. Lines of police with riot shields and batons raised pushed through the Climate Camp to break up the occupation. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The police ""kettling"" tactic was used during the 2009 G20 protests
Eventually, after another mammoth legal battle, the courts backed the Met's decision-making that night, saying the commander was entitled to judge that violence would have been imminent had he not used the containment and dispersal strategy.
It's worth pointing out that while the Met has won these two key legal cases over kettling and dispersal, a far more serious incident happened during the G20 protests.
Ian Tomlinson, an entirely innocent newspaper vendor died after he was pushed over by a police officer as he tried to head home.
An inquest jury found he had been unlawfully killed and the officer was later tried - but acquitted of manslaughter.
No commander in charge of policing protests wants to go through that experience again.
And that's why the right approach to containing and potentially dispersing a disruptive street demonstration on the scale of Extinction Rebellion comes down not only to the law and police resources, but the mood on the ground and some intelligence about the intentions of the demonstrators. "
Ukraine-Russia clash- Nato's dilemma in the Black Sea,www.bbc.com,,04-19-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-46425777,"Image caption Ukrainian forces took part in a tactical exercise near the Russian border on Monday Does crisis beckon in the Black Sea? Could Russia and Nato even come to blows?
That - at least for now - is probably unlikely. But the recent seizure of two Ukrainian gunboats and a tug in the approaches to the Kerch Strait, by vessels of the Russian Border Guard, has inevitably brought security in the Black Sea to the forefront of Nato's agenda at their meeting in Brussels on Tuesday.
The Black Sea has long had strategic significance.
It was, after all, the theatre for a major conflict between the Western powers France and Great Britain and Imperial Russia in the mid-19th Century. During the Cold War, it was the Soviet Union's shortest route to Iran and the Middle East. Turkey - a Nato ally - stood astride the Black Sea's southern exit to the Mediterranean, facing Russia across the Black Sea to its the north.
For the Russians this was always seen as their ""back yard"". And the end of the Cold War and the break-up of the Soviet Union greatly complicated relationships. Incursion, or deterrence?
Russia has engaged in armed conflict against two independent states that were formerly part of the Soviet Union - Georgia and Ukraine. It has annexed Ukrainian territory - Crimea - and continues to support armed rebels in eastern Ukraine. And it backs separatist enclaves that have broken away from the Georgian government.
Russia is alarmed at what it sees as Nato's growing incursion into the region. Three nearby states, Turkey, Romania and Bulgaria, are members of the alliance. Nato conducts air policing operations out of Romania, helping them to defend their territory by intercepting Russian jets approaching their air space. Ukraine country profile
Similarly, Nato warships have stepped up patrols in the Black Sea. Romania is hosting a US-built ballistic missile defence site. And Nato - along with individual Alliance members - is developing military ties with its partner countries Georgia and Ukraine.
Viewed from the Nato headquarters in Brussels, this is simply helping to provide stability and a measure of deterrence in the face of a more assertive Russia. Ukraine, for example, is eager to ensure that the Sea of Azov does not become a Russian-controlled lake. And Nato as a whole is intent on challenging Russian dominance of the Black Sea itself.
However, viewed from Moscow, this is all part of what they see as Nato's broadening land grab; its desire to push the borders of the Alliance ever closer to Russia. And given that this is an area of historic significance for successive Russian regimes, the stakes are very high indeed. Russia remains unmoved
Nato has a problem.
On the one hand, its member governments' rhetoric calls for stability and de-escalation while they take steps - such as military exercises and economic sanctions - that the Russians are bound to see as provocative. Judging the balance between deterrence and provocation is not easy, especially when pressure alone is often unlikely to change Russia's behaviour. Image copyright AFP Image caption Military drills near the port city of Mariupol took place last week
Take the Ukraine crisis for example. Sanctions show no sign of changing President Putin's mind, nor are they likely to secure the return of Crimea any time soon. Russia appears willing to accept the pain of sanctions because its interests in the ""near-abroad"" matter more.
This calculus makes Nato's response to the latest crisis between Russia and Ukraine more difficult. Analysts have called for a variety of measures, from the deployment of Nato vessels in the Sea of Azov - which would probably be illegal since it is an inland sea not an international waterway, and impractical because Russia could easily seal the Kerch Strait; to stepped-up economic sanctions; or even efforts to compensate Ukraine for the economic losses it is suffering from what is effectively a semi-blockade of its ports.
There will be those in Ukraine and among its more strident supporters in the US who see this as adding to the case for stepping up arms supplies to Kiev. While Nato countries do lots of training for the Ukrainian military, they have largely baulked at providing lethal weaponry. The Trump administration has supplied a limited number of Javelin anti-tank weapons to redress a significant defensive shortcoming in Ukraine's ground forces. But some experts have suggested, for example, that Kiev should be given shore-based anti-shipping missiles to help even up the naval balance in these enclosed waters.
There is no perfect solution to this strategic stand-off separate from a more fundamental recasting of the relationship between Russia and the West. The immediate task is to ensure that things do not get worse. War is ever-changing
And this raises another fundamental problem for Nato. Warfare is changing.
Indeed, the once-clear boundary between war and peace is dissolving. We hear a lot about military demonstrations, exercises, cyber attacks and information operations. Traditionally, these have been seen as a prelude to conflict.
But what if they are actually the war itself , as one senior US commander recently asked?
In other words, you no longer have to risk full-scale warfare; you just use a variety of tools to apply pressure to achieve the same ends. In this light, Russia is already having some success against Ukraine.
It has seized Crimea and shows no sign of relinquishing it. It is exacting an economic cost from Kiev by interfering with shipping in the Sea of Azov.
It has, as it might argue, weakened the Ukrainian president at a time when he faces a difficult re-election campaign, by seizing three vessels and their crews. All at a price that Moscow seems willing to pay.
This, then, is Nato's dilemma: how does it reassure friends and allies in the Black Sea region without simply making matters worse? Related Topics"

Leica China video sparks backlash over Tiananmen Square image - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-19-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-47987817,"Image copyright Reuters Image caption This year marks the 30th anniversary of the pro-democracy protests A promotional video for camera company Leica has sparked backlash in China for featuring a famous Tiananmen Square image.
The video depicts photographers working in conflicts around the world, including a photographer covering the 1989 protests.
People on Chinese social media site Weibo have called for a boycott of the camera brand.
Leica has distanced itself from the video.
""Tank Man"" was a lone protester who brought a column of tanks to a standstill during a crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in Beijing in 1989.
He refused to move out of the way and climbed onto the leading tank to speak to the driver. He was later pulled away from the scene by two men. What happened to him remains unknown.
Beginning with the caption ""Beijing 1989"", the Leica video features a photographer taking the famous image . The ""Tank Man"" can be seen in the camera's lens.
Users on Chinese social media site Weibo have been forbidden from commenting on recent official posts by Leica. However some people are managing to post carefully worded comments on earlier official Leica posts, BBC Monitoring has found.
A search of the hashtag Leica shows that 42,000 users have left posts on Weibo but only 10 are available to view.
Some comments urge users to ""boycott the camera"" and joke about the company being linked to ""patriotic Huawei"".
Chinese technology giant Huawei has been restricted by the US and other countries over security concerns in telecommunications networks. Consumers in China have rallied around the company, which uses Leica technology in its latest mobile phones.

However it features Leica cameras and the company's logo at the end of the footage.
They added that the company ""must therefore distance itself from the content shown in the video and regrets any misunderstandings of false conclusions that may have been drawn"".

Stagecoach calls for inquiry after rail bid document leak - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-19-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-47990807," Stagecoach has called for an inquiry into the way rail franchises are awarded, after details of a bid it submitted were sent to a rival.
The transport giant claims the Department for Transport (DfT) failed to properly investigate the matter.
The DfT said rival Abellio had not accessed information that would have affected the Stagecoach bid.
Last week, Stagecoach was stripped of the East Midlands rail contract and barred from applying for two more.
'Materially flawed' Stagecoach said in a statement that there had been a ""serious breach of the integrity of the procurement process"".
A Stagecoach Group spokesman said: ""We do not consider the matter closed. There is growing evidence that the procurement process followed by the DfT in this case has been materially flawed and should be subject to an independent investigation.
""We believe there are also wider questions to be answered across other franchise competitions.""
Sensitive Stagecoach documents for the East Midlands franchise were inadvertently emailed by a transport official to Stagecoach's rival, Abellio, which ended up winning the contract.
The government said Abellio had not looked at the documents.
""An expert third-party investigation established conclusively that Abellio did not access any information relating to any other bidders that affected their bid. There was no effect whatsoever on the outcome of the bid process.
""Stagecoach disqualified themselves from the process by lodging non-compliant bids,"" the DfT said.
When approached by the BBC, Abellio refused to comment on the matter.
Stagecoach was disqualified from three competitions to run rail services by the DfT, which earlier this month said the firm had not met pensions rules.
At the time, Stagecoach said bidders for the franchises had been asked to bear full long-term funding risk on relevant sections of the Railways Pension Scheme.
Image copyright Virgin Trains The Pensions Regulator has estimated the UK rail industry needs an additional Â£5bn to Â£6bn to plug the pensions shortfall.
'Reckless' approach It emerged on Friday that Stagecoach sent a letter to MP Frank Field, chair of the Work and Pensions Committee, on Wednesday.
In the letter, Stagecoach said the DfT had ""sought to rip up the long-standing position that the government is the ultimate guarantor of the Railways Pension Scheme"" and that its approach was ""reckless"".
The firm urged the committee to ""request a full independent value-for-money review"" of the DfT's position.
Stagecoach had been bidding to renew the West Coast franchise in partnership with Virgin Trains and France's SNCF when it was disqualified.
Stagecoach had also applied for the East Midlands and South Eastern franchises, both of which were rejected.
After the disqualifications, Virgin boss Sir Richard Branson said his train business, which is 49% owned by Stagecoach, could disappear from the UK."
Tech Tent: Do we want our cities to be smart? - BBC News,www.bbc.com,Rory Cellan-Jones Technology Correspondent,04-19-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-47977655," These days it seems every city wants to be smart. That seems to mean putting sensors in everything and collecting vast amounts of data with the aim of making urban life more efficient and environmentally friendly.
On the Tech Tent podcast this week, we examine the smart city phenomenon. We hear from people who believe it promises it a greener future, and from one city where privacy campaigners believe it is giving more power to private companies for surveillance.
Stream the latest Tech Tent podcast on BBC Sounds In Milton Keynes, we visit the Electric Vehicle Experience Centre. It is part of the town's campaign to get more of its motorists to go electric.
Visitors are shown a variety of cars, get information about range and charging options and - for a small fee - they can even borrow a car for a few days.
If they decide to buy a car, the local council may offer a charger on a lamp-post - also for a small fee, of course - or point the motorist to charging stations nearby.
There is even a plan to build a fast charging station which will give a full charge in five minutes, though that depends on new technology expected to arrive in electric vehicles over the next year.
Brian Matthews, head of transport innovation at Milton Keynes Council, hope to allay common concern such as ""the price of the vehicles, how they will charge them, and range anxiety"".
It seems to be working. Uptake of electric vehicles in the town is running at twice the UK average.
Milton Keynes' other smart city initiatives include a trial of delivery robots that take small grocery orders to customers along the town's pavements.
There are also autonomous pods that will soon be shuttling drivers between car parks in an attempt to keep traffic out of the town centre.
One thing they have not tried is electric scooters. They are now common in US and Chinese cities, but illegal on British streets under a law dating back to the 19th Century.
We visit Paris, where a clutch of e-scooter rental firms - many from California - are competing for business.
Parisians seem enthusiastic about this relatively cheap and green way of making short journeys. But there are already problems emerging .
The pavements are cluttered with dozens of scooters. People are riding them without helmets, sometimes with children perched on the front. It also looks as though there is an investment bubble that could see firms go bust, leaving the city with a mess to clear up.
Image caption E-scooters on the streets of Paris And while we have heard plenty of enthusiasm for the idea of using technology and data to make cities a lot smarter, in Toronto there is something of a backlash.
The Canadian city has done a deal with a division of Google called Sidewalk Labs. It plans to turn a stretch of land on the waterfront into a smart district: a city ""built from the internet"" is how the promoters describe it.
But privacy campaigners are suing the government, claiming that the plan will involve handing over sensitive personal data to a private company.
Brenda McPhail from the Canadian Civil Liberties Association explains the group's concerns about giving free rein to a firm in the business of collecting vast amounts of data.
""Online, we increasingly understand that comprehensive data collection that permits very granular monitoring of people's activities and behaviours is harming individuals and groups,"" she says.
""We question why on Earth we think it's a good idea to import that big data model into our city streets.""
The organisation behind the Waterfront Toronto scheme says that it has not yet received a plan from Sidewalk Labs, but once it does it will ensure that the public has a fair opportunity to provide meaningful input on the proposals.
The technology industry often assumes that developments such as smart cities are uncontroversial and that everyone will welcome something that could improve urban life.
But the public has grown sceptical about technology over recent years, so we can expect to see further battles like the one underway in Toronto."

MPs will get a series of votes on Wednesday on what type of Brexit they support, after an unprecedented defeat for the government on Monday night . The so-called ""indicative votes"" will happen because a proposal by Conservative MP - and Remain supporter - Sir Oliver Letwin was backed by a majority of 27. Thirty Tory MPs voted against the government, including three ministers - Richard Harrington, Alistair Burt and Steve Brine - who have now resigned.
The votes could make it clear what type of deal MPs support, including a ""softer"" Brexit, or even another referendum. But Theresa May says there is no guarantee she will abide by their decision. ""The votes could lead to an outcome that is un-negotiable with the EU,"" she told MPs.
Mrs May's deal with the EU has already been rejected twice by MPs. But our political editor Laura Kuenssberg says some may now ""take fright"" and move behind her deal. ""Faced with the choice of Theresa May's compromise, or a much longer wrangle to a closer relationship with the EU, it is not impossible that the numbers will move in her favour,"" she says.

What do voters make of Brexit now?
By Sir John Curtice, Professor of Politics at Strathclyde University
At present, the average level of support for the two options (after Don't Knows are excluded) is Remain 54%, Leave 46%. In part, this is because Leave voters are a little less likely to say they would vote the same way again (82%), than Remain voters are (86%).
But the swing to Remain, such as it is, is also down to those who did not vote in 2016. Of this group, 43% say they would vote Remain, whereas 19% say they would back Leave.
In truth, the polls are too close for opponents of Brexit to assume that a second ballot would produce a different result. But, equally, supporters of Brexit cannot say with confidence that the balance of opinion remains as it was in June 2016.

The Daily Telegraph says the prime minister's authority is now ""in shreds"" after last night's vote. It also points out that Mrs May is now powerless to stop the indicative votes going ahead - and adds that, if she tries to resist the outcome, Parliament could override her again, by tabling its own Brexit Bill. The Sun expresses its anger in a strongly-worded editorial attacking what it calls ""Labour's soft Brexit squad"". It goes on to criticise an anti-Brexit petition - saying ""no sane person is impressed by 5.6 million Remainers signing a petition""; and then takes aim at those who went on Saturday's pro-EU march - describing them as ""grey-haired Waitrose regulars... hoisting snarky little placards"".

Militia detains migrants at gunpoint along the US-Mexico border - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-19-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-47980143,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Five numbers that explain US border crisis A video has emerged of armed right-wing militia members stopping over 300 migrants as they cross the Mexico border into the US state of New Mexico.
The group calls itself the United Constitutional Patriots, and are seen in the Facebook clip standing over migrants sitting on the desert ground.
The group's actions have been condemned by civil liberties groups and New Mexico state officials.
The militia supports President Donald Trump's plan for a border wall.
The incident comes amid a spike in border crossings, despite White House efforts to stem the influx.
US to jail more migrants requesting asylum Deportation reversed for husband of US soldier What does the video show? The video, posted to militia member Jim Benvie's Facebook page, shows a large group of migrants who were said to have just crossed the border near Sunland Park, New Mexico, being detained by the armed vigilantes on 16 April.
The migrant group, which contains many women and children, are seen sitting and squatting in the darkness and squinting up into the militia's spotlights.

Before Border Patrol agents arrive to take custody of the migrants, a woman narrating the video tells a man who appears to be a militia member ""don't aim the gun"" in the direction of the families.
Mr Benvie, a spokesman for the United Constitutional Patriots, told the New York Times the group has been camping in the region for the past two months and plans to stay until Mr Trump succeeds in building his controversial border wall.
""If these people follow our verbal commands, we hold them until Border Patrol comes,"" Mr Benvie said, describing the interaction as a ""citizen's arrest"".
""Border Patrol has never asked us to stand down,"" said Mr Benvie, who is visiting the region from his home state of Minnesota.
What's the reaction? New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham said in a statement that the vigilantes had no legal right to stop anyone inside the US.
""If migrant families are made to feel threatened, that's completely unacceptable,"" she said.
""And it should go without saying that regular citizens have no authority to arrest or detain anyone.""
New Mexico Attorney General Hector Balderas warned in a statement that ""these individuals should not attempt to exercise authority reserved for law enforcement"".
Image of crying toddler wins World Press Photo Contest Why 'Abolish Ice' is risky for Democrats The American Civil Liberties Union described the group as an ""armed fascist military organisation"" in a letter to the governor and attorney general.
""The Trump administration's vile racism has emboldened white nationalists and fascists to flagrantly violate the law,"" they say.
""This has no place in our state: we cannot allow racist and armed vigilantes to kidnap and detain people seeking asylum. We urge you to immediately investigate this atrocious and unlawful conduct.""
US Customs and Border Protection has previously said they are opposed to civilians patrolling the border in search of illegal crossers."

Turpin captivity case: Children forgive parents for torture - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-19-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-47991829,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption One of the couple's children reads a statement during the sentencing A couple from the US state of California have been sentenced to life in prison for starving and torturing all but one of their 13 children.
David and Louise Turpin were arrested in January 2018 when their 17-year-old daughter escaped their home in the city of Perris and raised the alarm.
The children had been abused for at least nine years and some were found chained up in filthy conditions.
But several of the children told the court they had forgiven their parents.
The couple are expected to serve the rest of their lives behind bars, unless they are granted parole in 25 years.
Image copyright David-Louise Turpin/Facebook Image caption The couple's Facebook page contained numerous family photos What did their children say? The Turpins wept as they heard victim-impact statements from four of their children at Friday's hearing.
One child recounted being haunted by the ordeal.
I cannot describe in words what we went through growing up,"" said his statement.
""Sometimes I still have nightmares of things that had happened such as my siblings being chained up or getting beaten.
""That is the past and this is now.
""I love my parents and have forgiven them for a lot of the things they did to us.""
Image copyright AFP Image caption David Turpin broke down as he learned his fate Another child, in a statement read by her brother, also forgave her parents for the abuse.
""I love both of my parents so much,"" she said.
""Although it may not have been the best way of raising us, I am glad that they did because it made me the person I am today.""
How can parents torture their children? 'Happy family' image hid house of horrors But not all the children were so conciliatory.
One daughter, who was visibly shaking, said: ""My parents took my whole life from me, but now I'm taking my life back.
""I'm a fighter, I'm strong and I'm shooting through life like a rocket.""
She added: ""I saw my dad change my mom. They almost changed me, but I realised what was happening.""
Image copyright AFP Image caption Louise Turpin occasionally smiled during Friday's sentencing What did the parents say? David and Louise Turpin cried as they apologised for the treatment of their children.
The 57-year-old father's lawyer read a prepared statement on his behalf, saying: ""My home schooling and discipline had good intentions.
""I never intended for any harm to come to my children. I love my children and I believe my children love me.""
He was an engineer for major US defence contractors Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption David and Louise Turpin have agreed to lengthy prison terms after pleading guilty to torture, child abuse and false imprisonment Speaking directly to the court, housewife Louise Turpin, 50, said she was ""truly sorry"" for what she had done.
""I love my children so much,"" she said. ""I really look forward to the day I can see them, hug them and tell them I'm sorry.""
What did the judge say? The couple sat stony-faced as the judge rebuked them for their ""selfish, cruel and inhuman treatment"".
Judge Bernard Schwartz said: ""You have severed the ability to interact and raise your children that you have created and brought into this world.
Image copyright facebook Image caption The Turpin family with an Elvis impersonator in Las Vegas, where the parents renewed their vows ""The only reason that your punishment is less than the maximum time in my opinion is because you accepted responsibility at an early stage in the proceeding.
""And you spared your children having to relive the humiliation and the harm they endured in that house of horrors.""
What did the children endure? The tidy exterior of the middle-class family home 70 miles (112km) south of Los Angeles offered a veneer of respectability that masked the squalor and stench of human waste found by authorities within.
The children, between the ages of two to 29 at the time of the police raid, were severely malnourished.
A 22-year-old son was discovered chained to a bed. His two sisters had just been released from shackles.
The victims were forbidden to shower more than once a year, were unable to use the toilet and none of them had ever seen a dentist.

Newly released audio of their daughter's call to 911, obtained by ABC , provides a hint of the conditions in which the children lived.
""Two of my sisters and one of my brothers... they're chained up to their bed"", the 17-year-old girl, who did not know her own address, told the emergency operator.
""Sometimes I wake up and I can't breathe because how dirty the house is.""
The girl was also unaware of the year or month, or the meaning of the word ""medication"".
The children - whose names all begin with the letter J - were kept indoors, but were allowed out for Halloween, or on family trips to Disneyland and Las Vegas.
About 20 people from across the country, including nurses and psychologists, have offered to care for the seven adult siblings and six children."
Ex-Peru president's daughter reads suicide note at funeral - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-19-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-47993257,"These are external links and will open in a new window Close share panel Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Supporters of Alan GarcÃ­a voice their anger at the former Peru president's wake. Thousands have turned out for the funeral of Peru's ex-President Alan GarcÃ­a, who killed himself this week.
Mr GarcÃ­a shot himself in the head as police knocked on his door to arrest him on suspicion of taking bribes from the Brazilian company Odebrecht.
His daughter read his suicide note at the wake.
In the letter, Mr GarcÃ­a stated that he did not have to suffer the ""injustices"" of being arrested for alleged acts of corruption.
In what was the most dramatic event in the sprawling Odebrecht scandal - an investigation into how the company bribed officials or electoral candidates across Latin America in exchange for lucrative building contracts - Mr GarcÃ­a ended his life on Wednesday to avoid arrest. Huge corruption scandal shows no sign of waning
Friends, allies and leaders across the political spectrum paid their respects to Mr GarcÃ­a at the headquarters of his APRA party, one of Latin America's oldest political parties.
There was also plenty of anger aimed at President MartÃ­n Vizcarra, with some shouting ""Vizcarra is a murderer"" at the wake, in reference to Mr GarcÃ­a's claim that his prosecution had been politically motivated.
At least eight people died on their way to the funeral when the bus they were travelling in crashed into the side of a bridge. What was in the note?
During the wake, the former leader's daughter, Luciana GarcÃ­a Nores, read a letter her father had penned before taking his own life.
""I have seen others paraded in handcuffs guarding their miserable existence, but Alan GarcÃ­a does not have to suffer those injustices and circuses,"" he wrote in the letter, Efe news agency reports.
""For that reason, I leave my children the dignity of my decisions; to my colleagues, a sign of pride. And my corpse as a sign of my contempt towards my adversaries because I already fulfilled the mission that I set myself.
""May God, to whom I go with dignity, protect the good-hearted and the most humble."" What was Mr GarcÃ­a accused of?
Investigators say he took bribes from Odebrecht during his second term in office, linked to a metro line building project in the capital.
Odebrecht has admitted paying almost $30m (Â£23m) in bribes in Peru since 2004.
But Mr GarcÃ­a maintained he was the victim of political persecution, writing in a tweet on Tuesday that there was ""no clue or evidence"" against him.
In November last year he unsuccessfully applied for political asylum in Uruguay.

Nearly 200 other people were also hospitalised after the product, called super cereal, was delivered to them.
""There is a potential link but of course we need to be certain,"" a World Food Programme spokesman told the BBC.
""We won't know until the government and WFP's laboratory tests locate where people are getting sick from,"" he said.
The people taken in for treatment complained of vomiting, fever and other symptoms consistent with food poisoning, the BBC's Catherine Byaruhanga says.
The WFP said that some people also had symptoms of ""mental confusion"". More about Uganda
WFP says the patients were from families that had received a batch of the fortified food last week.
Super cereal is usually given to pregnant or nursing women at risk of malnutrition, but has been included in general rations across the country for malnourished Ugandans and refugees, WFP spokesman Peter Smerdon told the BBC's Focus on Africa programme .

Uganda hosts some 1.1 million refugees - more than any other African nation. Many are women and children who have fled across the border from South Sudan.
Super cereal is distributed throughout Uganda, WFP says, but all the reported cases of suspected food poisoning are in the north-eastern Karamoja region.
Previous conflicts there, along with drought and extreme poverty have left some communities reliant on food aid, says the BBC's Catherine Byaruhanga in the capital, Kampala.
Efforts are under way to retrieve food bags that have already delivered. What are the symptoms of food poisoning? Feeling sick or nauseous"

Afghanistan women face losing everything in Taliban talks - BBC News,www.bbc.com,Lyse Doucet Chief International Correspondent,04-19-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-47967516,"These are external links and will open in a new window Close share panel Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Ogai Wardak, 18: ""If the Taliban come, I will fight them"" When 18-year-old Ogai Wardak came face to face with Taliban fighters, her fear quickly gave way to cautious hope.
""Their faces were scary, but their hearts were kind,"" she tells me when we meet in the Kabul studios of Zan TV, the only Afghan television channel just for women.
""The Taliban of this time are not like the past, not like the scary stories I heard,"" explains the ebullient young woman bursting with personality. She was born in 2001, the same year the Taliban were toppled from power.
Wardak met some of their fighters during last year's rare three-day ceasefire, when they slipped into Kabul to gaze at city streets, even taking selfies and savouring ice cream.
But if the Taliban return to power, would they allow her to keep presenting on Zan TV?
""No!"" she exclaims, without skipping a beat. ""But I have to fight them because it's my dream, and I have to work for my sisters."" Who exactly are the Taliban?
As Afghans engage in a new round of talks with the Taliban, this time in the Gulf state of Qatar, this historic step is concentrating women's minds on how much they stand to win - or lose.
Politician Fawzia Koofi is one of the only women who attended the first round of negotiations in Moscow in February.
""It was not an easy moment,"" she admits when we sit down in Kabul. Image caption The women of Zan TV are determined to keep fighting for their rights
""When I entered the room, everything they did in Afghanistan during their time crossed my mind,"" she recalls. Hers is an everywoman story about being stopped from attending school and being pelted with stones as she walked down the streets.
""We listened to each other, and we didn't agree on very much, but in that moment I realised we can't go back,"" she tells me.
The past in Afghanistan is a different country. Its deeply conservative society has undeniably changed since the Taliban's harsh rule.
It's a story which inspires but also, still horrifies. The country still often called ""the worst place to be a woman"" has a female literacy rate of only 17%. And yet, women held about a quarter of the seats in the last Afghan parliament. 'We are still resisting'
Remarkable women have risen to the highest offices, but many more remain trapped in virtual prisons with little say over every decision in their lives.
""I told my father I was first in my class and I wanted to go to university and build my future,"" one young woman with a rose pink headscarf tells me, too afraid to mention her name. ""But he threatened me at gunpoint and said you have to accept whatever your father says.""
In a modest building shielded by iron gates, tucked away in a maze of Kabul streets, we meet her and two other brave women who agree to speak of heartbreaking stories of forced marriages, domestic violence, and eventual escape.
The woman who watches over them has her own tale to tell.
""I taught girls in a secret room in my house during Taliban time,"" she says, but also demurs when I ask her name. ""We're still resisting,"" she replies with a grimace which underlines the gravity of the situation facing these women and thousands more like them.
But their fear folds inside a fighting spirit.
""I think women need to resist,"" the pink-scarved woman insists after revealing how her father had chained her in a dark room for a month-and-a-half until she agreed to marry a man of his choice.
""There are many illiterate people in Afghanistan so girls like me who study should raise their voices and make their families, and our society, understand."" Image caption Horia (second right) fought family expectations to pursue her dream
At the Horiana Fitness Gym in Kabul, a thick metal door is firmly locked to keep out any unwelcome visitors.
""We've received threats several times and been warned that if we don't close, we'll be punished,"" explains, matter-of-factly, 19-year-old Horia Qurbani, who runs a gym with bodybuilding, yoga and dance classes for women.
With a shock of close cropped hair with blonde streaks peaking from beneath her head scarf, she exudes a confidence as strong as her fitness.
""The first criticism I got was from my family,"" she tells me. ""They told me 'you live in a conservative society and you're not allowed to do this and you don't have the capability'."""
India election 2019: The man who has lost 24 times but won't give up - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-19-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-47987657,"Image copyright Omkar Khandekar Image caption Mr Kondekar tells the public to ""vote for the boot"" - his election symbol Every Indian election throws up several independent candidates who, despite the odds stacked against them, take a chance on democracy. Omkar Khandekar reports on one man who has lost two dozen times but refuses to stop trying.
Vijayprakash Kondekar is now a familiar face in Shivaji Nagar in the western city of Pune.
For the past two months the 73-year-old has been going around the neighbourhood trying to drum up support for his election campaign.
""I just want to show people that party politics is not the only way in the largest democracy in the world,"" he says. ""I plan to give the country independent candidates like myself. It's the only way we can clean up all the corruption.""
Mr Kondekar is contesting a parliamentary seat that will go to the polls in the third phase of voting on 23 April. India's mammoth general election kicked off on 11 April and is taking place over seven stages, with votes being counted on 23 May.
 India has thousands of political parties, each with their own symbols Mr Kondekar is running as an independent candidate. One day, he hopes to become prime minister.
If that happens, he says he will give every Indian citizen 17,000 rupees ($245; Â£190). He says doing so would be ""easy enough"" if the government reduced other expenses.
Until the late 1980s, he used to work for the state electricity board in Maharashtra. Now, he can often been seen walking around Pune, pushing a steel cart on wheels with a signboard attached to it. Previously, locals say, the board carried a request for donations - but not much, less than a dollar.
Now the signboard says ""Victory for the boot"" - a reference to the election symbol allotted to Mr Kondekar by India's Election Commission.
It makes for an amusing sight in the city's streets. While many people ignore the aspiring politician, others request selfies. Mr Kondekar happily obliges, hoping to benefit from free publicity on social media.
Image copyright Omkar Khandekar Others openly scoff at what they see: a frail man with long white hair and a beard, walking in the hot April sun to canvass for votes while wearing only cotton shorts.
And that's before they find out that Mr Kondekar has contested - and lost - more than 24 different elections at every level of the Indian political system, from local polls for municipal bodies to parliamentary elections.
He is one among hundreds of independent candidates trying their luck in this year's national election. In 2014, just three of the 3,000 independent candidates who contested won.

Since the first election in 1952, a total of 44,962 independent candidates have run for parliament, but only 222 have won.
Independents rarely win because parties have far more money and better resources available to them. And there's no shortage of parties, with 2,293 registered political parties, including seven national and 59 regional parties.
The governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and opposition Congress are the two major national parties but in many states they trail strong regional parties with hugely popular leaders.
But Mr Kondekar says he has found a novel strategy to gain an advantage.
As per election rules, candidates from the national parties are listed first, followed by those from state parties. At the bottom are the independents. ""My appeal [to the public] is vote for the last candidate, the one listed before the none-of-the-above option. In all probability, it will be an independent candidate,"" he says.
For Tuesday's vote, he has changed his surname to Znyosho, so that his name appears last on the candidate list.
 The name of the candidate appears alongside their personal or party symbol Despite the disadvantages they face, independent candidates jump into the fray every election for myriad reasons. For some it's a vanity project, while many are fielded by political parties hoping to divide votes.
Others, like K Padmarajan, contest the polls as a stunt. He has taken part in - and lost - more than 170 elections only to earn a place in the Guinness Book of World Records.
Mr Padmarajan, who is competing against Congress leader Rahul Gandhi in the southern seat of Wayanad this Tuesday - recently said, ""If I win, I will get a heart attack.""
Such candidates have even prompted India's law commission to recommend a ban on independent candidates contesting state or national parliamentary elections.
That never happened. And although more and more independents are taking part, their success rate is not increasing.
""Political parties have a stranglehold on the Indian political system,"" says Jagdeep Chhokar, founder of election watchdog the Association for Democratic Reforms.
 Congress leader Rahul Gandhi is contesting the southern seat of Wayanad There are several systemic problems stymieing independent candidates' election campaigns, Mr Chhokar adds. For one, there are limits on how much can spent by individual candidates but not the political parties backing them. Independent candidates also don't enjoy the income tax exemptions that political parties do.
""There are candidates who genuinely want to make a difference but funding limitations, lack of influence and public perception in favour of big parties often constrains their chances.""
Mr Kondekar is aware that he's unlikely to win. Over the years, he has sold ancestral land and a house to raise money for his campaigns. His only source of income - as per the disclosures he made while filing his nomination - is a monthly pension of 1,921 rupees ($28; Â£21).
But while admitting that his fight is mostly symbolic, Mr Kondekar refuses to give up hope.
""It's a contest between their [political parties'] iron sword and my paper cut-out,"" he says. ""But I want to keep trying. Given my age, this will most likely be my last election. But perhaps things might be different this time."""
