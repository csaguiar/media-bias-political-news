Week in Review | The Regulatory Review,www.theregreview.org,The Regulatory Review,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.theregreview.org/2019/04/05/16704/,"A A A
IN THE NEWS The U.S. House of Representatives voted 263‚Äì158 to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act , which protects victims of domestic and sexual violence. The National Rifle Association reportedly criticized a new part of the law that bans abusive domestic partners from owning firearms, calling it ‚Äútoo broad and ripe for abuse.‚Äù Supporters reportedly agreed that the ban is needed, pointing to data that suggest that over half of female homicide victims were killed by intimate partners. In a 6‚Äì3 vote, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that expert testimony in an administrative hearing for Social Security Disability Insurance benefits can count as ‚Äúsubstantial evidence‚Äù even if experts refuse to produce the data underlying their opinions. Without taking a position on the sufficiency of the evidence in the case, Justice Elena Kagan held that expert witnesses‚Äô refusal to produce supporting evidence does not categorically require a court to infer that their testimony is not credible. In separate dissents, Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Neil Gorsuch both wrote that the evidence in this case was insufficient to support a denial of the applicant‚Äôs benefits. The U.S. House of Representatives passed a resolution condemning the Trump Administration‚Äôs support for a recent decision of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas that invalidated the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The resolution calls the Administration‚Äôs challenge to the ACA ‚Äúan unacceptable assault on the health care of the American people.‚Äù Although House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) promised that Democrats ‚Äúwill fight relentlessly in court and in the Congress‚Äù to protect the ACA, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) reportedly said that the resolution would do nothing for Americans‚Äô health care. The U.S. Department of Labor proposed a new four-part test for determining if two businesses jointly employ workers under the Fair Labor Standards Act . If adopted, this would be the first substantive amendment to the Labor Department‚Äôs joint employment standard since 1958. The new test aims to fill a void left by the 2017 withdrawal of the Obama Administration‚Äôs guidance on joint employer status. Six states and Washington, D.C. sued the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) for rolling back an Obama-era rule that raised nutrition standards for school lunches. The complaint alleged that USDA failed to provide an opportunity for the public to comment on certain parts of new rule, as required by the Administrative Procedure Act . The states also argue that the change was not based on ‚Äútested nutritional research,‚Äù as required by Congress. ‚ÄúThe Trump Administration has undermined key health benefits for our children‚Äîstandards for salt and whole grains in school meals‚Äîwith deliberate disregard for science, expert opinion, and the law,‚Äù New York Attorney General Letitia James said . The House Appropriations Committee‚Äôs Subcommittee on the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies held a hearing on the fiscal year 2020 budget request for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler testified before the Subcommittee, responding to concerns about the policy impacts of a 31 percent budget cut for the agency. Wheeler reportedly stated , ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre trying to be very creative with what we are doing with the budget, in today‚Äôs world where we are trying to tighten our belts across the board.‚Äù Subcommittee Chair Betty McCollum (D-Minn.) called the budget request ‚Äúunrealistic,‚Äù suggesting that Congress will reject the proposed cuts. The U.S. Senate voted to reduce the amount of debate time required before confirming executive nominees and federal District Court judges from up to thirty hours to up to only two hours. Speaking from the Senate floor, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) agreed with Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) that ‚Äútwo hours for a lifetime appointment with a huge influence on people‚Äôs lives is unacceptable.‚Äù Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) responded that the President is ‚Äúentitled to set up the administration and make it function.‚Äù The U.S. Department of Energy published a final rule amending cost sharing for research or development activities under the Energy Policy Act of 2005 . Specifically, the rule exempts higher education and nonprofit institutions from the requirement that research entities obtain at least 20 percent of the funding for research or development activities from non-federal sources. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service requested public comment on applications to conduct certain activities with endangered species. Among the applicants, the Los Angeles Zoo and Botanical Garden applied for a captive-bred wildlife registration for over 30 endangered species, including the snow leopard, maned wolf, and chimpanzee. The comment deadline is May 1, 2019.
WHAT WE‚ÄôRE READING THIS WEEK What role does cost-benefit analysis (CBA) play in an era of deregulation? In a recent paper, Daniel Farber of Berkeley Law argued that the Trump Administration‚Äôs deregulatory approach has focused entirely on the costs of regulation without consideration of their benefits. Farber suggested that recent procedural changes‚Äîsuch as a proposed EPA rule that would allow the agency to ignore certain relevant evidence in cost-benefit calculations‚Äîmay signal the declining importance of CBA as the ‚Äústandard for rational, data-driven decision making.‚Äù A recent Columbia Law Review article by George Washington University Law School Professors David Fontana and Naomi Schoenbaum analyzed how the sex-based pregnancy regulations that implement the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) hinder equality. Fontana and Schoenbaum emphasized that FMLA allows childcare exceptions for expectant mothers but excludes protections for expectant fathers who want to participate in caregiving roles. The authors argued that these gendered regulations continue to reinforce the stereotype that women are the primary childcare providers. Congress should consider the implications of expanding the U.S. Copyright Office‚Äôs rulemaking authority when considering amendments to the Copyright Act , Joseph P.

Trump supporter charged with threatening to kill Rep.

I Act & Talk Like It‚Äù A 55-year-old man from upstate New York has been charged with threatening to kill Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar . Patrick Carlineo, of Addison, N.Y., allegedly made the threat during a call to the Democrat‚Äôs office in Washington, D.C. on March 21. ‚ÄúDo you work for the Muslim Brotherhood? Why are you working for her, she‚Äôs a fucking terrorist. I‚Äôll put a bullet in her fucking skull,‚Äù Carlineo allegedly said, according to the court filing . When authorities went to Carlineo‚Äôs home he seemed to know why the FBI wanted to speak to him. ‚ÄúHe stated that he was a patriot, that he loves the President, and that he hates radical Muslims in our government,‚Äù notes the affidavit . He also said that Omar ‚Äúsupported Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood, and that her election to Congress was illegitimate.‚Äù Carlineo initially told authorities he had told Omar‚Äôs staffer that ‚Äúif our forefathers were still alive, they‚Äôd put a bullet in her head,‚Äù denying he called her a terrorist and threatened to kill her. But after he was warned that it was a crime to lie to an FBI agent, he acknowledged he may have said something to that effect.

The New York chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) characterized this as another example of how President Donald Trump‚Äôs rhetoric has emboldened bigots. ‚ÄúThe political environment, led by an Islamophobe in the White House, has normalized hate speech and emboldened bigots in their actions,‚Äù CAIR-NY executive director Afaf Nasher said . ‚ÄúThe rising threat of Islamophobia and white supremacy must be taken seriously.

Look, I‚Äôm not a smart man. OK, yes I am. But even a man not-as-smart-as-I-am could see that all Ali Velshi was doing in this interview on Friday was trying to berate Howard Schultz out of the race because he threatens the Democrats‚Äô chances in 2020.
Watch below:
If you don‚Äôt care to watch, I don‚Äôt blame you, although it IS an interesting view into how far-left progressives are threatened by Schultz, and how you can use emotion when you don‚Äôt actually have an argument to support your side.
Basically, Velshi BERATES Schultz for being a ‚Äúrich guy‚Äù and ‚Äúnot getting it‚Äù about why America is divided. Schultz is trying to say that both Republicans and Democrats have failed the poor, while Velshi is trying to beat him into saying no, it‚Äôs just the Republicans.
Since Schultz isn‚Äôt a wuss, he doesn‚Äôt back down. That‚Äôs why Velshi has to bitch and moan about it on twitter: Like Jamie Dimon and @RayDalio , @HowardSchultz displays either a remarkable lack of understanding or a willful ignorance about why our economy is bifurcated. https://t.co/gfHkiYz0pz ‚Äî Ali Velshi (@AliVelshi) April 5, 2019
Let me translate: ‚Äúwahhhh! Schultz isn‚Äôt a liberal like me! I hate him!‚Äù
So Schultz slaps him down a notch: No, Ali. I forgive you for talking over me when I said the wealthy should pay more in taxes and get less. We should tax all capital gains as income and close loopholes. We need to preserve our free market economy so everyone can succeed. https://t.co/jmhwFQIwlv ‚Äî Howard Schultz (@HowardSchultz) April 6, 2019
But Velshi is too partisan and stupid to realize it: 1. Thanks for coming on.2. Please rewatch. I did not speak over you when you made those points.3. A wealthy billionaire-turned-politician offering unsolicited ‚Äúforgiveness‚Äù to a journalist for a tough interview is a bad look. https://t.co/QQgEfTDSPw ‚Äî Ali Velshi (@AliVelshi) April 6, 2019
1) He DID talk over him many times, and 2) noone gives a DAMN about ‚Äújournalists‚Äù especially on MSNBC, and especially when all they‚Äôre doing is attacking a candidate for the sake of the health of the Democratic party.

Share on Facebook Share on Twitter
Beto O‚ÄôRourke seemed like some emo squish just a few weeks ago, driving around aimlessly in his car in search of himself and keeping a travel journal to rebound from his loss to Sen. Ted Cruz. And though he stood with his dirty shoes on a bunch of coffee bars and lunch counters, he never really seemed to reveal any concrete policy positions.
Fast forward to this week, and O‚ÄôRourke was on video comparing the Trump administration to the Third Reich .
O‚ÄôRourke seems to have decided the ‚Äúnice guy‚Äù approach wasn‚Äôt working, and now he‚Äôs straight-up lying about things President Trump has said about MS-13, the travel ban, and Charlottesville. Democrat Beto O'Rourke lies a lot right here:
-Trump said ‚Äúwe have an 'infestation' of MS-13 gangs in certain parts of our country‚Äù-The travel ban is not a Muslim ban-Trump never said neo-Nazis and KKK members were ""very fine people""-The remaining comments need more context pic.twitter.com/vwhSlw2IlG
‚Äî Ryan Saavedra (@RealSaavedra) April 6, 2019
You know it already, but we‚Äôll say it again. Whenever Trump now speaks of MS-13 gang members, liberals translate that to mean ‚Äúasylum seekers.‚Äù The ‚ÄúMuslim ban‚Äù allowed travel from plenty of Muslim-majority countries (most of them, in fact). And no, Trump never called neo-Nazis and Klan members ‚Äúvery fine people‚Äù (although Hillary Clinton did call former Klan member Robert Byrd her mentor).
We want to talk about that last one a bit, because there‚Äôs been an effort recently to debunk the #CharlottesvilleHoax. Anyone who sends any time on Resistance Twitter will see references all the time to Trump calling neo-Nazis ‚Äúvery fine people,‚Äù but that too was taken out of context, and people like Scott Adams have been working to correct the record: Today if you do a Google search for ""fine people"" and ""Charlottesville"" you see a link debunking the hoax in the third spot. Thank you all for helping correct the record. @joelpollak @CortesSteve pic.twitter.com/AlhK7yDf6L
From RealClearPolitics :
My colleagues seem prepared to dispute our own network‚Äôs correct contemporaneous reporting and the very clear transcripts of the now-infamous Trump Tower presser on the tragic events of Charlottesville. Here are the unambiguous actual words of President Trump:
‚ÄúExcuse me, they didn‚Äôt put themselves down as neo-Nazis, and you had some very bad people in that group. But you also had people that were very fine people on both sides. You had people in that group ‚Äì excuse me, excuse me, I saw the same pictures you did. You had people in that group that were there to protest the taking down of, to them, a very, very important statue and the renaming of a park from Robert E. Lee to another name.‚Äù
After another question at that press conference, Trump became even more explicit:
‚ÄúI‚Äôm not talking about the neo-Nazis and white nationalists because they should be condemned totally.‚Äù
So, no, Beto, Trump did not call Nazis and Klan members ‚Äúvery fine people‚Äù ‚Äî he was talking about people protesting the removal of a statue of Robert E. Lee during that manic week-long news cycle we had when every Confederate statue and painting and memorial had to be taken down. Not only that; ESPN pulled announcer Robert Lee from a college football game because of his name; that‚Äôs how crazy it was.
So far today we‚Äôve had Mark Elliot revive the lie that Trump called ‚Äúasylum seekers‚Äù animals, and now O‚ÄôRourke is going full-throttle with the lies; his original pitch on unifying the nation obviously was a bunch of crap. He‚Äôs as bad as any of them. He‚Äôs just feeding the libs what they want

The recent discovery of mummified cats in a well-preserved tomb probably shouldn't be surprising. It's a long-established fact that ancient Egyptians loved cats .
What's perhaps more remarkable, however, is the fact that a tomb unveiled on Friday contained a sort of mummified menagerie of 50 animals ‚Äî and there were mummified mice and falconsin addition to the cats. The Tomb of Tutu in Sohag contained mummified mice and falcons. Mohamed Abd El Ghany / Reuters
The tomb is colorfully painted and well-preserved ‚Äî and Mostafa Waziri, secretary-general of Egypt's Supreme Council of Antiquities, called it ""one of the most exciting discoveries ever in the area.""
Waziri told Reuters the tomb contains a lobby and a burial room with two stone coffins. It is said to have been built for a man named Tutu and his wife. The area outside the burial chamber also contained mummies of a woman and a boy between 12 and 14 years old. The newly discovered site also contains well-preserved wall paintings. On the walls of the tomb are depicted funeral processions; images of the owner, Tutu; and his family genealogy. Mohamed Abd El Ghany / Reuters
This animal-filled tomb is part of a series of recent archaeological discoveries in Egypt. According to Reuters, the tomb was one of seven burial sites found near the Egyptian town of Sohag last October. Smugglers had been illegally digging for artifacts in the area.
Another tomb was unveiled in Saqqara , outside of Cairo, in December. Dozens of cat mummies and 100 cat statues were also found in Saqqara in November. February 2018 saw the unveiling of another 4,400-year-old tomb .
As NPR's Laurel Wamsley reported, the Egyptian Ministry of Antiquities sees the announcement of new discoveries as a way to attract tourists.
Tourism in Egypt slowed for years after the 2011 revolution. In December, The Associated Press reported that the industry has yet to recover, even though visits are gradually increasing.

SCOTT SIMON, HOST:
Fritz Hollings has died, the former South Carolina governor and six-term U.S. senator. He was 97. Here's Fritz Hollings giving his farewell speech on the Senate floor in 2004.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
FRITZ HOLLINGS: And if you really ought to be enriched - your life, period, right across the board - the best postgraduate course and everything you can possibly take is to run and be in the Senate.
SIMON: Mr. Hollings also ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1984. We're joined now by Kirk Victor, who collaborated with Fritz Hollings on a memoir. And he covered him as a correspondent with National Journal. Thanks very much for being with us, Mr. Victor.
KIRK VICTOR: It's an honor to be with you, Scott. I've listened to you for years. Although, very sad circumstances.
SIMON: He was - well, the word colorful doesn't quite cover it, does it?
VICTOR: It really does not. He was quick-witted, sharp. His acerbic tongue, I think, sometimes got more coverage than his accomplishments. Just as an example, in one of his Senate races back in '86, his opponent, a guy named McMaster, challenged him to a drug test. And Senator Hollings said, I'll take a drug test if you will take an IQ test.
SIMON: (Laughter) Mercy. Well, and you point out there's obviously a couple of other instances in which maybe he was just a little too colorful, right?
VICTOR: A little too colorful, yes, indeed.
SIMON: He - when he first ran for governor of South Carolina, he campaigned against desegregation. But he changed his mind in public, in office, didn't he?
VICTOR: He did. I mean, one of the most remarkable things he did actually was at the end of his gubernatorial term, when he didn't have to, but he gave an address to the state legislature and said we have run out of courts. The rule of law is supreme. We cannot essentially stand in the courthouse door. We can't support segregation anymore.
And this is when African-American Harvey Gantt was seeking and had been admitted to Clemson. And of course, there was great resistance throughout the South.
SIMON: It's impossible to sum up 38 years in the Senate, but I put you in that position anyway.
VICTOR: Well, that is a very difficult position to be in because he did so much. He was a deficit hawk. He spoke his mind. He was just - he fought hunger, helped create the the WIC program - Women, Infants and Children program. He was a proud protectionist in some ways on trade. So it's very difficult to sum up what a remarkable career he had.
SIMON: And there was a courthouse named for him. He took an unusual position in his later years, didn't he?
VICTOR: He did. That was just four years ago in 2015 with the Hollings Judicial Center in Charleston. And he wanted to have it renamed for a courageous judge, Judge Waring, who in the '40s and '50s ruled against segregation and got death threats and was shunned in Charleston and throughout the state. And Hollings took - and Senator Hollings took the unprecedented move of urging that courthouse be renamed. Stunning. And Senator Lindsey Graham, vice president - then Vice President Biden - and others spoke and just were very moved by an incredible gesture by, really, a very great senator.
SIMON: Kirk Victor on the death of former South Carolina governor and six-term U.S. senator Fritz Hollings. Thanks so much for being with us.
VICTOR: Thank you so much for having me on, Scott. Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR. ¬© 2019 Georgia Public Broadcasting"
U.N. Urges An End To Fighting In Libya As Opposition Army Heads Toward Tripoli,www.gpb.org,Jenny Gathright,04-06-2019,2019,4,http://www.gpb.org/post/un-urges-end-fighting-libya-opposition-army-heads-toward-tripoli,"By Jenny Gathright ‚Ä¢ 15 hours ago Gen. Khalifa Haftar is Libya's former top army chief. He now leads the Libyan National Army, which is advancing toward the U.N.-backed government in Tripoli. Mohammed El-Sheikhy / AP Originally published on April 7, 2019 4:09 am
Updated at 3:48 p.m.
International concern is mounting over the situation in Libya. The Libyan National Army, led by Khalifa Haftar, says it has now advanced into the southern outskirts of the capital Tripoli, where the U.N.-backed government is located.
G7 foreign ministers have urged an end to the fighting. ""We urge all involved parties to immediately halt all military activity and movements toward Tripoli,"" the body, which is composed of the foreign ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the U.K. and the U.S. wrote in a statement.
The U.N. Security Council, which met behind closed doors on Friday, has also called on Libyan National Army forces to cease their advances.
The fear, according to The Associated Press, is that the Libyan National Army's advances toward the capital could lead to ""a major showdown with rival militias."" Both the Libyan National Army and the U.N.-backed government have various militias supporting them.
United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres left Libya on Friday . He met with Gen. Haftar and then told journalists he was leaving Libya ""with a deep concern and a heavy heart."" Guterres has insisted that Libya needs a political solution, not a military one, and said the U.N. is available to facilitate a peace process.
The U.N. is still planning to hold a previously scheduled conference on elections in Libya, Reuters reported. The event, scheduled to begin April 14 in the country's southwestern town of Ghadames, is a set-aside time to consider whether elections could provide a path toward peace in the country.
""We know that holding the conference in this difficult time of escalation and fighting is a difficult matter,"" U.N. special envoy Ghassan Salame told reporters in Tripoli on Saturday. ""But we are determined to hold it on time unless compelling circumstances force us not to.""
Libya has been extremely unstable since NATO-backed forces deposed its former dictator Moammar Gadhafi in 2011.
In a 2016 interview with Fox News, former President Obama called his handling of the aftermath of that revolution the worst mistake of his presidency. Obama has said the U.S. should have done more to fill the vacuum left by Gadhafi.
By 2014, Libya had devolved into a civil war, and ISIS had become increasingly influential there. According to Reuters, the U.S. provided air support to Libyan forces fighting ISIS in 2016 and continued to launch strikes on suspected militants there after the end of that campaign.
A study conducted by the New America Foundation found that at least 2,158 airstrikes and drone strikes were conducted by foreign and domestic powers in Libya between September 2012 and June 2018. According to the study's estimates, between 242 and 395 civilians were killed in the strikes, and between 324 and 524 were wounded.
New America found that the Libyan National Army, led by Haftar, conducted 1,112 of those airstrikes. The United States conducted 524 of them.
In addition to political and military chaos in Libya, there have also been reports of gross human rights violations there. Last year, the United Nations human rights office found that the country contained ""open slave markets"" where migrants were bought and sold . According to Reuters, various armed groups control many of the country's ports and beaches. Copyright 2019 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org. ¬© 2019 Georgia Public Broadcasting"

Breaking The Cycle Of Disinvestment In Lower-Income Communities,www.gpb.org,Claire Trageser,04-06-2019,2019,4,http://www.gpb.org/post/breaking-cycle-disinvestment-lower-income-communities,"Breaking The Cycle Of Disinvestment In Lower-Income Communities By Claire Trageser ‚Ä¢ 17 hours ago Project Reo Collective is a coffee shop in San Diego's Paradise Hills neighborhood that had trouble getting a bank loan to expand after a year of operation. Claire Trageser / KPBS
It's not uncommon for people who want to start businesses in lower-income neighborhoods to have trouble getting bank loans. But increasingly, there are investors looking specifically to help businesses in those areas, with the aim of reversing the cycle of disinvestment.
""There's always reasons to say no to a borrower. We are looking for reasons to say yes,"" says Lauren Grattan, a founder of the San Diego-based investment company Mission Driven Finance . She explained that her company doesn't look at personal credit scores. ""We instead look at the validity of the business and how well can you repay from the business earnings.""
Her company's goal is to fill the gap between more traditional profit-motivated investing and philanthropy that focuses on economic development.
One business that could have used help like this is Project Reo Collective , a coffee shop in Paradise Hills, a lower-income neighborhood of San Diego.
The coffee shop is situated in a small strip mall near a Mexican restaurant and a cell phone store. On most days, the cafe is filled with people working on laptops or hanging out while drinking Mexican mochas or lavender lemonades. Two specialties of the Project Reo Collective coffee shop are its lavender lemonade and Mexican mocha. Claire Trageser / KPBS
""Project Reo Collective started out as five families who got together ... cleaning up the neighborhood here,"" says Tommy Walker, one of the owners. ""A lot of people in the neighborhood said, 'We wish we had somewhere to hang out, somewhere we grab a cup of coffee, meet our neighbors, do some homework or study.' "" You have a cycle that kind of perpetuates that neighborhood being less friendly to business. Businesses don't get started. So employment stays depressed. The job opportunities aren't there in the neighborhood. Businesses that are there don't expand. - Spencer Cowan, Woodstock Institute
Walker says that after a successful first year, he went to a bank asking to borrow $4,000 for an espresso machine. But, he didn't have any luck.
""They said, 'No, you guys don't qualify because you haven't been around long enough,' "" he says.
A problem of disinvestment
Having trouble getting a small-business loan like this is typical, according to data compiled by the nonprofit Woodstock Institute in a report titled ""Patterns of Disparity."" It shows that between 2012 and 2016, only about one in five businesses in low-income areas across the United States received bank loans or even business credit cards. That's compared with almost three in five businesses in higher-income areas.
""You have a cycle that kind of perpetuates that neighborhood being less friendly to business,"" says Spencer Cowan, the researcher who compiled the data. ""Businesses don't get started. So employment stays depressed. The job opportunities aren't there in the neighborhood. Businesses that are there don't expand.""
He says it can also drive businesses to predatory lending. I had two years of experience with profit, but I got rejected for every loan I tried for. - Natalie Gill, small-business owner
That's what happened to Natalie Gill. After running her flower-arranging business out of her home, she wanted to expand to a flower shop and cafe called Native Poppy .
""I had two years of experience with profit, but I got rejected for every loan I tried for,"" she says.
A normal small-business loan has 5 to 10 percent interest, but she took a loan from an online company. ""It was at 18 percent interest, and I had to pay it within three years, which was a risk I was willing to take because I had no other options,"" she says.
Bank investment vs. community investment
Banks are restricted in whom they can choose for loans, says Carty Davis, an investment banker with C Squared Advisors.
""A bank can't just say, 'I really like this person. I'm going to take a flier on them because I know they're going to be successful,' "" he says. ""They have a good business plan, but if they don't have equity to put into the deal or cash to put into the deal, it's going to be very difficult to get a loan approved.""
Davis says banks have certain criteria that must be met, such as a good credit history. He suggests that if potential borrowers don't have that, they can go to the federal Small Business Administration.
But here's the issue for lower-income communities: Those loans still require big cash down payments or home equity, which business owners may not have.
There are alternative ways of getting financing, such as from a company like Mission Driven Finance. In addition to investing in small community businesses, Mission Driven Finance also helps people looking for small-business loans better understand the technicalities of borrowing money to open or expand businesses.
The point, founder Lauren Grattan says, is to invest in neighborhoods that really need it. Because when businesses succeed, they hire locally and the entire community reaps the benefits. Copyright 2019 KPBS Radio. To see more, visit KPBS Radio . ¬© 2019 Georgia Public Broadcasting"

SAGAL: The song, which if you haven't heard it - and let's be honest. None of you have heard it...
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: ...Mixes high and low frequencies, distracting mosquitoes from their usual hobbies of blood-sucking and getting it on. It isn't that they hate Skrillex music. This is the thing - it's not like it's driving them away. They love it. They're, quote, ""entertained by it, which means they attacked hosts less often than those in a dubstep-free environment""...
(LAUGHTER)
TOM BODETT: So even mosquitoes are having less sex.
SAGAL: Exactly right."

PETER SAGAL, HOST:
Now onto our final game, Lightning Fill In The Blank. Each of our players will have 60 seconds in which to answer as many fill-in-the-blank questions as he or she can. Each correct answer now worth two points.
Bill, can you give us the scores?
BILL KURTIS: Tom and Peter each have three. Roxanne has two.
SAGAL: All right, Rox, you are in third place. You're up first, fill in the blank. On Wednesday, Theresa May once again requested an extension for the blank deal.

KURTIS: It's what we do.
(APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: The man who was shot five times in the back took himself to the ER. And when the police got there, he told them a mysterious assailant attacked him while he was protecting an asset. The man's wife was not amused by this nonsense and blew his cover. The man insists he will be exonerated once the full Mueller report is released.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Bill, I think Roxanne did spectacularly well, am I right?
KURTIS: Well, a rare moment here - eight right. She leads with a total of 18.
SAGAL: All right, we have flipped a coin. Peter has elected to go next. So, Peter, fill in the blank. On Sunday, a whistleblower revealed that 25 people in the White House were granted blank despite significant red flags.

SAGAL: No, he rushed to the graveyard to dig up his grandpa's skull.
(GASPING)
SAGAL: According to a new study, a bad diet put you at a higher risk for death than blanking.
GROSZ: Than lack of exercise.
SAGAL: Than smoking. On Tuesday, pharma-bro blank was put in solitary after it was revealed he was running his business from prison.
GROSZ: Shkreli.
SAGAL: In what experts are calling the most Swedish arrest ever, an officer...
(SOUNDBITE OF GONG)
SAGAL: ...In Stockholm apprehended a man while they were both blanking.
GROSZ: Making meatballs, wearing bikinis and acting as a muppet chef.
(LAUGHTER)
TOM BODETT: That was a great guess.
GROSZ: That's pretty Swedish.
SAGAL: They're all very Swedish.
SAGAL: No, in this case, they were both sitting in a sauna.
(LAUGHTER)
GROSZ: Put your hands up. No, God, don't. Please put the back down.
(LAUGHTER)
GROSZ: Bill, how did Peter do on our quiz?
KURTIS: He got five right, 10 more points, total of 13, which means Roxanne is still in the lead.
SAGAL: All right, so I'm guessing then...
(APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: ...That in order to win Tom has to be perfect, right?
KURTIS: He has to get the full boat.
SAGAL: Here we go, Tom. This is for the game. Fill in the blank. On Wednesday, the White House began their ninth round of trade talks with blank.

BODETT: Oh, is that North Carolina?
SAGAL: Yes.
(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)
SAGAL: This week, a Maryland man was extradited to Florida on charges that he had a blanked while on vacation there.
BODETT: Oh, God. He dressed as a Chinese woman and snuck a malware USB into Mar-a-Lago.
SAGAL: No, he was arrested because in vacation in Florida he had tackled a pelican. On Thursday...
(LAUGHTER)
BODETT: I think. The pelican. It was the the pelican undid me.
SAGAL: I know. On Thursday, Target announced that it was raising its blank to $13 an hour.
BODETT: It's beginning wage, minimum wage.
SAGAL: Yeah.
SAGAL: According to a new study, cats are able to recognize their own blanks.

(SOUNDBITE OF GONG)
SAGAL: ...A company created the new alarm clock that uses the soothing sound of blank.
BODETT: Oh, I know this. It's a cat coughing up a hairball.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: You know, I'm going to give it to you.
BODETT: Seriously.
(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)
SAGAL: It's - the answer we have was a puking dog, which I know is not to same.
BODETT: It will - it wakes you up. If you've got pets...
SAGAL: Yeah.
BODETT: ...You hear that, it's like go, go.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: An Odd Alarm is an app with a variety of traumatizing sounds ranging from smoke alarm to dog barfing in your bed. I'm sure they have cat coughing up hairballs in there.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: The distressing alarms mean you're less likely to snooze through them. But if that doesn't work, there's always the premium membership, which is a real dog, and that guarantees you'll never sleep passed 6:30 every again.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Bill, did Tom do well enough to win? I don't think so.
KURTIS: So close. He got seven right, 14 more points, total of 17, but lost to Roxanne of 18.
BODETT: Of course, that was hardcore.

(APPLAUSE)
EARLE: Yoga was just a thing that was sort of a - I fish with a fly rod. And I get - I travel places where that's fun to do. And I fell in a river for the first time, you know, and I was just getting back in the boat, floating down to the next spot and talking to a friend of mine. And I just said, man, my core strength is just going. And he said, well, you know, I've been taking yoga a couple of times a week, a guy comes. And I thought, I spend money on dumber stuff than that. But...
(LAUGHTER)
EARLE: So started as that - as dealing with a physical issue. But I'm - the way I'm still here is 12-step programs. And, you know, that's - it's a spiritual program.
(APPLAUSE)
EARLE: And one of the things you're supposed to do in 12-step programs is get to a place where you pray or meditate every day. And that was the only thing that I didn't do. And I'm kind of an old hippie anyway. And so I've known about these things all my life. But through that association, I met a yoga teacher in New York. And I started studying with her. I'm on blocks and, you know, a lot of cheating going on because...
(LAUGHTER)
EARLE: ...I started when I was 60.
SAGAL: Yeah, I understand that. You've been married six times? Seven times? Six times?
EARLE: Seven times, six wives.
SAGAL: Right. So...
EARLE: And I have to correct the - for the record, seven divorces.
SAGAL: Oh, excuse me.
EARLE: I'm single at the moment.
SAGAL: You're - oh, excuse me. OK.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Now, when people talk about people who've been married a lot, we often joke about, you know, hope over experience and, you know, they just think this time it's going work out and we talk about people's optimism. What I was thinking about in your case is how do you - if you meet a woman and the woman knows you've been married, say - let's pick middle - five times before, how do you convince her, like, no really...
EARLE: Well...
SAGAL: ...It was always their fault?
EARLE: Well, wait a minute - no. Here's the real question is if you've been married six times and you meet a woman that's willing to marry you...
SAGAL: That's what I mean. Yeah.
EARLE: Yeah. What, you know, it's a - yeah, that should give you pause and, you know...
(LAUGHTER)
EARLE: I'm finally starting to get it.
SAGAL: Yeah.
(LAUGHTER)
ROXANNE ROBERTS: OK. So let me ask a question. Elizabeth Taylor was married so many times because she liked being married.
EARLE: Yeah.
ROBERTS: Do you like being married?
EARLE: I played 200 shows last year. That's shows - that's nights that I actually performed. So whoever was married to me probably didn't like it all that much because I was gone about half the time. And I didn't really know what really being married was like the way that most people do it because I got my own room for over half of my life.
SAGAL: Yeah.
GROSZ: Steve, have you met Roxanne?
(LAUGHTER)
EARLE: I did meet Roxanne.
SAGAL: Yeah, I know. Yeah. Well, Steve Earle, we've invited you here to play a game we're calling...
BILL KURTIS: Steve Earle, meet Steve Urkel.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: As I'm sure you remember, you've been around.
EARLE: Yeah.
SAGAL: Uber nerd Steve Urkel...
EARLE: Yeah.
SAGAL: ...Was one of the most popular TV characters of the 1990s in the show ""Family Matters."" I'm guessing you didn't have a lot of time to watch TV in the 1990s.
EARLE: You know what? I think - I don't think I've ever seen a complete episode of ""Family Matters.""
SAGAL: That's great.
EARLE: You got that part right.
SAGAL: Because that's the whole principle...
EARLE: I know.
SAGAL: ...That you're not supposed to know anything. Knowledge hurts.
EARLE: I was hoping you guys would mess this part up.
SAGAL: Yeah.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: We're going to ask you three questions about that icon in the flood pants and suspenders. If you get two right, you'll win our prize for one of our listeners - the voice of their choice in their answering machine. Bill, who is Steve Earle playing for?
KURTIS: Brian Heinz of Pleasant View, Tenn.
SAGAL: All right.
SAGAL: You ready?
EARLE: Cool.
SAGAL: Here's your first question. Now, the popularity of the character of Steve Urkel was great for the actor and the TV show but bad for whom? A, the actual Steve Urkel for whom the character was named, who spent a decade enduring jokes and disappointment that he didn't talk funny; B, the belt industry as Urkel suspenders caused a 40 percent decrease in sales; or C, speech therapists, who had to deal with people trying to talk like Urkel.
EARLE: Oh, let's say B.
SAGAL: You're going to go for B, the belt industry. People stopped buying belts because suspenders were so sexy.
EARLE: Yeah.
SAGAL: No. It's actually the real Steve Urkel.
EARLE: The real Steve Urkel. OK.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: There was a real guy named Steve Urkel who the character was named for. And he did not enjoy it after a very short while. Two more chances. Here's your next question. Urkel's popularity led to a number of branded products, including which of these? A, Steve Urkel nerd glasses with masking tape pre-applied; B, Urkel-O's breakfast cereal; or C, an automated chess player called the Mechanical Urk.
EARLE: Breakfast cereal I guess.
SAGAL: It is the..."
"Former Sen. 'Fritz' Hollings, 97, Has Died",www.gpb.org,Jenny Gathright,04-06-2019,2019,4,http://www.gpb.org/post/former-sen-fritz-hollings-97-has-died,"By Jenny Gathright ‚Ä¢ 18 hours ago Former Sen. Ernest ""Fritz"" Hollings, pictured here in 2003, died early Saturday, according to a former staffer. Mary Ann Chastain / AP Originally published on April 7, 2019 3:50 am
Former Sen. Ernest Hollings has died at the age of 97. Known as ""Fritz,"" the South Carolina Democrat served more than 38 years in the Senate and ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1984.
Steve Hartell, who was Hollings' legislative director from 1998 to 2003, told NPR he heard the news early Saturday morning.
""He was kind of ahead of his time,"" Hartell said. ""He was always focused on the essential needs of the country: competitiveness of the economy, the balance sheet of the country from a budget perspective. And as someone who was a World War II veteran who served his country as a 20-year-old in North Africa and Europe, above everything a patriot.""
Hollings was born on Jan. 1, 1922 in Charleston, S.C. He graduated from The Citadel Military College in South Carolina and served as a combat soldier in the U.S. Army from 1942 to 1945. After returning home and earning a law degree, Hollings was elected to the South Carolina legislature in 1948.
Hollings went on to serve as governor of South Carolina from 1959 to 1962, during a time when school desegregation was a major issue for the state. Hollings, according to The Washington Post , originally ran on a platform opposing desegregation but ended his term by urging the state legislature to accept integration of public schools.
According to the Charleston Post and Courier , Hollings defended South Carolina's pro-segregation position as a lawyer in a case that would later become the state's entry into Brown v. Board of Education .
Later, in 2015, he asked for his name to be removed from Charleston's federal courthouse, to be replaced by J. Waties Waring , a judge who declared forced segregation to be unconstitutional when few others in the Deep South were willing to do so.
After he finished his gubernatorial term, Hollings returned to politics in 1966 when he ran for senator in a special election. He won that election, and went on to serve in the Senate for just over 38 years, which makes him the eighth longest-serving senator ever. But he was actually an extremely senior ""junior senator"" for much of that time, because he served alongside South Carolina Sen. Strom Thurmond, a segregationist whose Senate career lasted 48 years.
Hollings is known for his work on hunger: He wrote a book on the topic, toured the country to speak about the issue and also co-authored the legislation that created the Women, Infants and Children program in 1972. WIC was piloted in that year as a supplemental food program aimed at improving the health of pregnant mothers, infants and children and was later expanded.
""He was the father of South Carolina's technical school system, which is the envy of the nation,"" Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. said in a statement Saturday. ""He led our state through the travails of the Civil Rights Movement with dignity and went on to become one of the most effective Senators to ever serve.""
Kirk Victor, who collaborated with Hollings on his memoir, told NPR's Weekend Edition the senator's ""sharp, acerbic tongue sometimes got more coverage than his accomplishments."" Hollings spoke his mind about people ‚Äî often to their faces.
On live TV, during a debate for the 1986 Senate campaign, Republican candidate Henry McMaster asked Hollings if he would be willing to take a drug test. Hollings famously fired back in his memorable southern drawl, ""I'll take a drug test if you take an IQ test.""
And it seems like Hollings preferred for others to be direct, too. He told The Herald of Rock Hill, S.C., that his 1998 Republican challenger Bob Inglis was ""so oozing and goozing and such a nice little choirboy and so pleasant, and everybody's rude, and he wants to be courteous.""
Then Hollings added, ""He is a goddamn skunk. I can tell you that right now.""
Sometimes his attacks were offensive. The Associated Pressreported that he once called Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, an Ohio Democrat, the ""senator from the B'Nai B'rith."" Hollings also reportedly used the racist term ""wetbacks"" to refer to campaign supporters of Alan Cranston, a former Democratic senator from California.
Hollings did not retire from the Senate quietly. In his 2004 farewell address, he scolded his colleagues for deficit spending.
""Rather than seeking the truth, we've been obscuring it,"" Hollings said. ""We're spending $6oo billion more than we're taking in.""
In that same speech, Hollings decried the influence of money in politics.
""The cancer on the body of politics,"" he said, ""is money. Money, money, money.""
""I'm sick of raising money to get re-elected,"" he told 60 Minutes before he retired . ""So I'm going home to Charleston."" Copyright 2019 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org. ¬© 2019 Georgia Public Broadcasting"

I‚Äôm excited to witness all that is coming within the next few months! Before starting here, I worked at an aquarium in Alaska and witnessed the ways a rapidly changing Arctic posed concerns to the welfare of marine mammals in natural environments. Through our new Wild Arctic exhibit (which opens this weekend!), we hope to help establish a deeper connection with our visitors to this remote environment and its engaging inhabitants. In using augmented reality in this exhibit, our goal is to inspire change and action that seeks to protect this ‚Äì and all ‚Äì threatened environments. While visitors engage with the AR technology of the Wild Arctic , our animal care team, scientists and veterinarians are actively engaged in pure and applied researched aimed at conserving Arctic species. This work can and will directly impact the Arctic ecosystem and its inhabitants like beluga whales, polar bears, walruses and others. And through our Summer Camp programming, young explorers, animal and nature lovers and budding marine biologists can discover ways they, too, can contribute to a better future. Children ages 3 to 16 have the opportunity to learn about animals, ecosystems, conservation, marine-based STEM and so much more. Actually, this sounds great ‚Äì can I sign up for camp? Plus, I am so excited to share that we are expecting ! Pearl, one of our resident harbor seals, is pregnant and due to deliver sometime this summer.

Manchester City 1-0 Brighton & Hove Albion: Manchester City reach FA Cup final,trendgossipnow.com,Trend Gossip Now,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://trendgossipnow.com/manchester-city-1-0-brighton-hove-albion-manchester-city-reach-fa-cup-final/,"Manchester City 1-0 Brighton & Hove Albion: Manchester City reach FA Cup final By 0 Highlights: Man City 1-0 Brighton Manchester City stayed on course for the quadruple as they reached the FA Cup final after edging out Brighton at Wembley.
Pep Guardiola‚Äôs side were nowhere near their best but a largely undistinguished contest was settled by Gabriel Jesus‚Äô stooping header after only four minutes, converted from Kevin de Bruyne‚Äôs perfect right-wing cross.
Brighton battled manfully but could not turn possession into prolonged threat, although City were grateful to Aymeric Laporte‚Äôs clearance from right under his own crossbar after the break with Glenn Murray poised to score.
Manchester City defender Kyle Walker was fortunate to escape a first-half red card after a VAR review for thrusting his head into the face of Alireza Jahanbakhsh after the pair clashed ‚Äì and ultimately they were happy to simply close out the win.
They will now face either Watford or Wolves in the final at Wembley on 18 May and also remain in the hunt for the Premier League and Champions League after winning the Carabao Cup. Manchester City battle through Gabriel Jesus‚Äô flying header gave Manchester City the lead
Manchester City have a list of three further targets as they chase a historic quadruple ‚Äì the FA Cup, Premier League and Champions League.
Some may regard as the FA Cup as the least pressing of those priorities but Pep Guardiola‚Äôs team selection and body language here at Wembley illustrates the importance he attaches to this historic competition, a trophy that has so far eluded him since his arrival in England.
The Catalan was animated throughout, often in fury, but his fist-pump to his backroom team as City moved into an attacking position in stoppage time showed he wants the FA Cup on his ‚Äì and his club‚Äôs ‚Äì CV very badly.
Make no mistake, City were were light years away from their imperious best, failing to confirm their authority after an early goal that ripped up Brighton‚Äôs blueprint of containment.
But, for a side that has world-class attacking football as its trademark, City gave very little away at the back and most key aerial challenges were won.
City did not excel ‚Äì but they are in the FA Cup Final and move on to face Tottenham Hotspur in the Champions League quarter-final first leg in the Londoners‚Äô majestic new stadium on Tuesday. Brighton lack killer touch
Brighton‚Äôs players were given a standing ovation at the final whistle from the supporters who packed their portion of Wembley, in recognition of the endeavour they had displayed.
It was deserved for the effort they put in which kept them in contention right until the end after it had looked like they may be swept aside once City struck the early blow.
In reality, however, they barely laid a glove on City for all their possession, the only real scare coming when Laporte had to hoist that second-half clearance over his own crossbar with Murray poised.
The Seagulls were never lacking in application but they just did not have the pace or threat to provide the final flourish to decent build-up work.
Chris Hughton‚Äôs side will take credit from their performance but, on reflection, may also regard it as something of a missed opportunity as they came up against an off-colour and uninspired City team.
The hopes of their first FA Cup final appearance since 1983 have disappeared and now it is back to the more routine business of ensuring Premier League safety. Man of the match ‚Äì Aymeric Laporte (Manchester City) Aymeric Laporte has been a defensive stalwart for Manchester City this season, and his clearance from under his own crossbar was crucial to protecting City‚Äôs safe passage to the final Quadruple ‚Äòalmost impossible‚Äô‚Äì manager reaction
Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola: ‚ÄúIt was a semi-final, Brighton are an incredible defensive team, we knew that set pieces were huge, massive. We conceded too many but only one dangerous situation. We are in the final, we are there.
‚ÄúMy opinion is that nobody has done it [won the quadruple] so why can we do it? It is almost impossible to achieve everything, that is the truth. Our fans will come, more than today, for the final, we are losing players every game but still we will try to do it.
‚ÄúI am happy to be in the final, we extend our season by one more week and we are happy for that.‚Äù
Brighton manager Chris Hughton: ‚ÄúI am incredibly proud. After conceding after three minutes I don‚Äôt think there was anyone in the stadium that thought the second wasn‚Äôt going to come. We hung in and to go through the 90 minutes and, apart from the goal, I struggle to think of a real clear chance. That wouldn‚Äôt have happened often. if at all, to them this season.
‚ÄúWe have raised the bar today in the level of our performance. The most important thing is to take that into the difficult games. We have got vitally important home games. We have to get something from those two.‚Äù Manchester City enjoy their trip to Wembley ‚Äì the stats Manchester City have reached their 11th FA Cup final, and first since 2013 when they eventually lost to Wigan. City have become the ninth different team to reach both major domestic English cup finals within the same season, after Arsenal, Chelsea, Everton, Liverpool, Manchester United, Middlesbrough, Sheffield Wednesday and Tottenham Hotspur. Brighton have never won in five competitive matches at Wembley in all competitions, drawing one and losing four. City have scored 20 goals in the FA Cup this season, the most by a team in a single season in the competition since Chelsea in 2011-12 (also 20). City are unbeaten in their last six games at Wembley in all competitions (W5 D1), conceding just one goal in those matches. Forty percent of Brighton‚Äôs shots in this match were taken by centre-back Shane Duffy (2/5). City boss Pep Guardiola has become the first manager to reach both major domestic English cup finals in the same season since Kenny Dalglish with Liverpool in the 2011-12 campaign. City striker Gabriel Jesus has scored 12 goals in 15 appearances in cup competition this season (FA Cup, League Cup and Champions League) compared to six goals in 25 appearances in the Premier League. What‚Äôs next?
City‚Äôs bid for the quadruple continues on Tuesday as they return to Champions League action. They meet Tottenham in the first leg of their quarter-final at 20:00 BST.
Brighton‚Äôs next game is an important home Premier League fixture against Bournemouth on Saturday (15:00) as they bid to avoid relegation. "
Conspiracy theorists keep their Ginsburg death claims alive,thehill.com,Jacqueline Thomsen,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/437661-conspiracy-theorists-keep-their-ginsburg-death-claims-alive,"Conspiracy theorists keep their Ginsburg death claims alive By Jacqueline Thomsen - 04/06/19 05:28 PM EDT
Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has been keeping busy since her cancer surgery in late December: She has returned to the bench to hear oral arguments, authored opinions and even made a few public appearances outside the courtroom.
But conspiracy theorists aren‚Äôt buying it, with some arguing that the 86-year-old justice has been dead for weeks and that Democrats are covering it up to stop President Trump Donald John Trump Trump to stage tax-day event in Minnesota Dem senator presses Pompeo: 'Do you believe our country is full?' Bipartisan senators offer bill to expand electric vehicle tax credit MORE from filling her seat. ADVERTISEMENT
The Supreme Court has been bombarded with Twitter users demanding evidence that Ginsburg is still alive, while some online videos allege her public appearances have been manufactured.
There are also claims that audio of her from recent Supreme Court oral arguments has been doctored and is nothing more than phrases pieced together from earlier recordings of her remarks.
Ginsburg has authored three court opinions since she was released from the hospital in December. The opinions weren't issued until February, but the documents are often the results of weeks, if not months, of debate and communication among the justices.
There‚Äôs little chance the Ginsburg conspiracy theory is going away anytime soon, experts say, mainly because the biggest proponents are unlikely to accept any proof that she‚Äôs alive.
And they said the somewhat secretive nature of the Supreme Court, where no television cameras are allowed, doesn‚Äôt help.
‚ÄúShe‚Äôs sort of a high-visibility celebrity on the left as a justice in the same way [late Justice Antonin] Scalia was a high-level celebrity on the right,‚Äù said Mark Fenster, a law professor at the University of Florida and author of ‚ÄúConspiracy Theories: Secrecy and Power in American Culture.‚Äù ADVERTISEMENT
That kind of visibility, Fenster said, combined with Ginsburg‚Äôs recent health issues and few public appearances, helps amplify these kinds of unfounded claims.
‚ÄúThe Supreme Court, it‚Äôs a sort of secret and opaque institution,‚Äù he said, adding that that kind of intrigue plays into conspiracy theories, which often focus on the elite.
Photos of Ginsburg at a memorial this past week for Israeli author Amos Oz were met with accusations of manipulation.
‚ÄúLove the creepy hand to the right by Ruth they always make stupid photoshop mistakes,‚Äù one Twitter user, whose bio references QAnon, tweeted in response to a photo of Ginsburg attending the event. ‚ÄúLike a freudsche slip. #RuthBaderGinsburg is dead.‚Äù
The narrative appears to have branched out from the so-called QAnon theory, which argues that there is a mass conspiracy playing out in the federal government, executed by the ‚Äúdeep state,‚Äù to prevent Trump from enacting his agenda.
A Google search for ‚ÄúRuth Bader Ginsburg dead‚Äù turns up thousands of tweets, many of them linked to users who make positive references to QAnon. YouTube videos on the topic have racked up tens of thousands of views.
One such video, which has been viewed more than 2,000 times since being posted last month, demanded proof of life, claiming a ‚Äúhearse was just seen leaving her neighborhood.‚Äù
‚ÄúFox & Friends‚Äù in January accidentally aired a graphic saying Ginsburg had died. The show‚Äôs hosts apologized, saying a control room error was to blame.
Supreme Court reporters also say they have been contacted by people searching for evidence that Ginsburg is alive.
The conspiracy theory's longevity has been helped by high-profile conservatives occasionally referencing it.
In January, former White House aide Sebastian Gorka Sebastian Lukacs Gorka Conspiracy theorists keep their Ginsburg death claims alive The Memo: New revelations fuel controversy over security clearances Nine White House officials of interest in Dem security clearance probe MORE drew attention to Ginsburg‚Äôs absence from the bench while she recovered from cancer surgery.
‚ÄúStill no sign,‚Äù he tweeted at the time. ‚Äú6 days left until Ruth Bader Ginsberg has to make her official appearance at @realDonaldTrump‚Äôs State of the Union.‚Äù
When NBC News reporter Ben Collins responded to Gorka's promotion of the theory, Gorka asked how ‚Äúthere can be a ‚Äòpublic‚Äô appearance behind closed doors.‚Äù
Gorka did not respond to a request for comment from The Hill.
Joseph Vitriol, a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard University who has conducted research on conspiracy theorists, said that Gorka weighing in on the theory may have given it a sense of credibility in more conservative circles.
Vitriol noted that Trump‚Äôs appointees to the Supreme Court have been among the most notable achievements since he took office. If Trump‚Äôs opponents were concealing Ginsburg‚Äôs death, Vitriol said, that would be viewed by conspiracy theorists as denying Trump another victory.
‚ÄúConservatives who believe in this conspiracy believe in it for that function ‚Äî to justify the belief that Democrats are dishonest and nefarious,‚Äù Vitriol said. ‚ÄúAnd that can function to make conservatives feel more vindicated in the perception they have of Democrats.‚Äù"

The university said in a statement that it shared the ‚Äúinternational revulsion‚Äù the laws induced and that it would reconsider a 1993 decision to confer the honorary degree of civil law by diploma to Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah.
The university added, however, that ‚Äújust as nobody has a right to confer an honorary degree, nobody has a right summarily to rescind it.‚Äù
‚ÄúThe decision to confer this degree 26 years ago was recommended by a Committee and approved by Council and by Congregation at the time,‚Äù they wheedled ‚Äî but insisted that ‚ÄúAt no point has the University declined to reconsider [the degree].‚Äù
Dozens of protesters raised the rainbow flag of the LGBT rights movement on Saturday outside London‚Äôs Dorchester Hotel, which Brunei‚Äôs sultan owns. Celebrities including George Clooney, Elton John and Ellen DeGeneres have supported a global boycott of nine hotels tied to Hassanal.
