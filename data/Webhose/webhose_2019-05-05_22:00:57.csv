9/11 Contradictions,911caper.com,HateLiars,04-06-2019,2019,4,http://911caper.com/2019/04/06/9-11-contradictions/,"An Open Letter to Congress and the Press David Ray Griffin The Unz Review Preface
The title of this book, 9/11 Contradictions, refers entirely to internal contradictions within the public story about 9/11. The book deals, in other words, with issues on which one person, agency, institution, or official body that has helped articulate the public story about 9/11 has contradicted another such person, agency, institution, or official body. In some cases, the contradiction is a self-contradiction, in which people contradict what they had said at an earlier time.
To give a few examples: In Chapter 1, we see that the White House has told two radically different stories about President Bush’s behavior in the classroom in Florida. The second and third chapters show that Secretary of Transportation Norman Mineta’s testimony about Vice President Cheney’s whereabouts that morning contradicts the account given by the 9/11 Commission. In Chapter 7, the contradiction is between Richard Clarke, on the one hand, and Donald Rumsfeld and the 9/11 Commission, on the other. In Chapters 8 and 17, we see that two of the government’s claims—about Barbara Olson’s calls to Ted Olson and about evidence of Osama bin Laden’s responsibility for 9/11—are contradicted by one of its own agencies, the FBI. Chapters 12 and 13 show that the 9/11 Commission’s main claims about United Flight 93, made in 2004, are contradicted by statements made in previous years by many US military officers. In Chapters 21 and 22, we see that statements made by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), which was given the task of explaining the destruction of the World Trade Center, are contradicted by numerous statements made by members of the Fire Department of New York.
In several chapters, the contradictions involve the mainstream media. (These contradictions are considered “internal” because the mainstream media, while perhaps challenging this or that detail of the story told by government officials, have supported all this story’s main elements.) Chapter 16, for example, shows that stories about cell phone calls from the flights, which have appeared in the media from the beginning, were contradicted by the FBI’s report on phone calls from the four flights, which was presented at the Moussaoui trial in 2006.
As its subtitle indicates, this book is addressed to Congress and the press. It is especially suitable for them for two reasons.
In the first place, most reporters and members of Congress are busy people, with little time to study complex issues. This book, besides being easy to read, requires no technical expertise in order to form a judgment about the issues involved.
Most other books about 9/11 revolve around various matters—such as FAA and military procedures, the conditions needed to cause steel-frame buildings to collapse, and the kind of damage that would be caused by an airliner striking the Pentagon—about which most people do not feel equipped to make a judgment.
In the present book, by contrast, no judgments requiring expertise are required, because each chapter revolves around a simple contradiction, which anyone can recognize. If Jones says “P” and Smith says “not P,” we can all recognize that something must be wrong, because both statements cannot be true.
In the second place, many members of Congress and the press have been reluctant to look into any possible difficulties about the public story for fear of being labeled “conspiracy theorists.” Although this may be unfortunate, it is understandable, because the most important asset of both journalists and politicians is their credibility. If they lose that, they lose their effectiveness, even their jobs. We can understand, therefore, that they are unwilling to risk being saddled with the dreaded “conspiracy theorist” label—one of the surest ways to lose credibility—by showing sympathy with people questioning the official account of what happened on 9/11.
Why is this—that anyone questioning the official story is almost automatically labeled a conspiracy theorist? It is because in most critical treatments of 9/11, the official account is rejected in favor of an alternative theory, which usually involves the idea that the 9/11 attacks resulted from a conspiracy within our own government.
The present book, however, contains no theory about what really happened. It provides simply an exposition of various facts. If Mineta said “P,” that is a fact. If the 9/11 Commission said “not P,” that is a fact. And it is a fact that “P” and “not P” cannot both be true.
Here, then, is the point of this book: 9/11 has clearly been the most important event in recent history. The accepted story about 9/11 has been used to increase military spending, justify wars, restrict civil liberties, and exalt the executive branch of the government. And yet there are serious contradictions within this accepted story: this book documents 25 of them. The existence of so many contradictions within such an important story is intolerable. Congress and the press are the two principal institutions with the power and the responsibility for looking into such matters.
This book is intended as a tool to help them fulfill this responsibility.
In doing the research for this book, I relied most heavily on the Complete 911 Timeline produced by Cooperative Research. This timeline, drawn entirely from stories in the mainstream press, aspires to identify and, when possible, provide links to all reports dealing with events related to the attacks of 9/11. This timeline, which is surely one of the greatest journalistic feats of all time, is an indispensable resource for serious discussions of 9/11. Many of the chapters in this book would have been simply impossible without it.
I also relied heavily on the help of three wonderfully unselfish people: Matthew Everett of England, who is one of the managers of the Complete 9/11 Timeline; Elizabeth Woodworth of British Columbia, a writer and former research librarian; and Tod Fletcher of California, who would regularly spot problems the rest of us had overlooked. These three individuals, besides improving this book immensely with their good advice and proofreading skills, alerted me to the existence of dozens of reports I would have otherwise missed. Insofar as this book is easy to read and its references are useful to other researchers by virtue of being complete and up to date, gratitude should be directed primarily toward them.
Enormous additional thanks go to Elizabeth: after serving as my virtual assistant in the production of this book, she did most of the work for the preparation of the index.
I also wish to thank Hilary Plum of Interlink Books, for excellent work in editing this book, and my wife, Ann Jaqua, making it possible, in so many ways, for me to engage in the research and writing required for this book."

We haven't had any inflation because the huge trans-national companies know they cannot raise prices, without limiting their customers ability to buy their products. At the same time, there's been huge inflation on luxury items. This is a consequence of the large income skew. The rich will pay anything, so the cost of a 1st class airfare ticket has like tripled because their target market can pay for it. Since wages haven't gone up for the bottom half, they risk hurting their bottom line if they raise the prices of consumer goods."

Zacks Investment Research upgraded shares of Omnicell (NASDAQ:OMCL) from a sell rating to a hold rating in a report issued on Wednesday morning, Zacks.com reports.
According to Zacks, “Omnicell has outperformed its industry over the past six months. The company has been consistently seeing solid uptake of Omnicell XT. Recently, it has inked various deals for its XR2 and the IVX Workflow products. A rise in bookings and product backlogs was also observed in the last-reported quarter. We are encouraged to note that the company is working on product innovation through R&D. Also, Omnicell is expected to gain traction from new launches, strategic partnerships (the recent one being with Stormont Vail Health) and digital transformation has been seeing increasing operating expenses. However, a resilient hospital capital expenditure environment might affect the adoption of the company’s solutions. A tough competitive landscape is a dampener as well. “ Get Omnicell alerts:

EPP: The gas directive ends the abuse of monopolies in the gas market,biznesalert.com,admin5,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://biznesalert.com/epp-gas-directive-monopolies/,"Alerts 5 April, 2019 11: EPP: The gas directive ends the abuse of monopolies in the gas market
“Today, we are putting an end to the era of external monopolies in the EU gas market which, for years, has exposed consumers to paying much higher energy bills and has been used to turn off gas taps in the middle of winter. This is excellent news for our citizens, industry and our overall security in the EU”, said Jerzy Buzek MEP, EPP Group Spokesman, after the deal on common rules for the internal market in natural gas was adopted by the European Parliament.
The Gas Directive will make all pipelines on the entire EU territory, including territorial seas of the Member States, subject to strict EU internal market rules: third-party access, ownership unbundling, transparency and non-discriminatory tariffs. It will also apply to the much-debated Gas Pipeline project NordStream2.
“But this Directive is not against any country, investor or particular gas pipeline. The amended law will apply to all existing and new infrastructure – equally to the internal EU gas pipelines as well as those from non-EU countries into the EU. If anyone has a problem with any of these provisions, it discloses their real intentions”, said Jerzy Buzek.
This vote is the end of a key phase, but also the start of an equally important process: full implementation of EU law, under the supervision of the European Commission and the EU Court of Justice.
“As before, the European Parliament will monitor it very closely. We will never agree that any gas pipeline that violates our energy security or goes against the principles, values and objectives of the Energy Union – including the diversification of sources and routes of gas supply – can count on any facilitations or derogations from EU law. Ensuring this is a big task for both the new Parliament and the European Commission”, Buzek concluded.

Poles fight for funds for energy transition in Brussels (REPORT),biznesalert.com,admin5,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://biznesalert.com/transforming-the-global-energy-system-how-to-finance-a-just-transition/,"Energy 5 April, 2019 10: Poles fight for funds for energy transition in Brussels (REPORT)
379 billion euros will need to be spent every year to reach the EU climate goals by 2030. Additional billions of euros in investments will be required for the 2050 goals. Where to direct the funds and how to utilise them? This was discussed by the participants in the EurActiv.com discussion on Transforming the Global Energy System: How to finance a just transition. The Polish Electricity Association is the partner of the event.
Catharina Sikow-Magny, Head of Unit Networks & Regional Initiatives, DG Energy, European Commission, said that the European Union’s climate goals indicate the direction the energy industry should follow. “It is about decarbonisation” – she said. There are appropriate legal frameworks, market, energy efficiency and security of supply rules leading to it. Ms Sikow-Magny has in this context reminded about the proposal of the European Commission assuming the integration of the management of the energy sector by the network operators to increase the number of interconnections between the Member States. “We have received the plans of individual Member States. In June we will talk about their deficiencies and what remains to be done with them” – she announced.
She stated that “no actor in the European Union may be left behind”. This was the aim of the establishment of, among others, the initiative to support the former mining regions, established by the European Commission. “This is a support for making these economies zero emission” – she added. She has also reminded of the Commission’s initiatives to counter energy poverty.
Peter Zapfel, responsible for the Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) at DG CLIMA, European Commission, has said that the Market Stability Reserve (MSR) mechanism will be influencing the prices in a way incentivising investments in energy transition. On the other hand, the trade in allowances is to provide funds for this spending. In addition, there are the Modernisation Fund that is to cause the energy transition in the energy generation sector and the Innovation Fund to support new technologies that include the CCS, energy storage and low-emission technologies in the energy sector.
Deputy Director of the Energy Department at the Ministry of Energy of Poland, Waldemar Łagoda has reminded that the energy transition in Poland will be the “biggest transformation in the sector since a century”. He reminded that the energy strategy designed by the government assumes reducing emissions through investments in renewable, nuclear and gas energy sectors. “This matter will be decided upon in the coming months” – he assured.
“The present regulations seem to be very friendly towards our plans” – admitted Mr Łagoda. “The structural funds will be directed towards low-emission technologies. We wish to move from the 80 per cent coal share in our energy mix to around 60 per cent in 2030. This will take significant investments” – he pointed out. He has reminded that Poland will also be eliminating the coal-fired sources of heating and that the EU money will also be helpful in this.
“The road to decarbonisation will depend on the fate of the energy sector” – said Dawid Klimczak, President of ENEA Trading. “Decarbonisation in Poland will cost 120-150 billion euros until 2045 depending on the calculations” – he estimated. “Poland’s energy sector welcomes the plans for investments in the energy transition. However, different players have different starting points. The changes in our sector require substantial amounts”.
“Not a single euro from the funds mentioned so far will reach the gas and nuclear sources that will be pivotal to the transition of Poland’s energy sector. Support for them should not be withheld” – appealed Mr Klimczak.
Marion Labatut, Director Policy Issues, EURELECTRIC, argued that decarbonisation of the energy sector could be completed by 2045 with 110 billion euros annually, not including the capital expenditures on the transmission grids required for the expansion of the RES. “Let us not forget about the new backup sources required for operation in situations when the renewables will not be generating” – she added. “This cannot be ignored.”
“At the end of the day, we must demonstrate that the energy transition is a viable business model. We are calling for the establishment of the Just Energy Transition Fund. The European Investment Bank has the tools for supporting investments in this area and should make use of them” – appealed Ms Labatut. “We must make sure that any source allowing emissions reduction will be qualified as sustainable” – she added. She has warned against the negative social impact of ill-conceived policies.
Piotr Arak, Head of the Polish Economy Institute has reminded that according to his calculations even 6.7 million people in Poland are facing the threat of energy poverty. “There is a need for a European fund that would allow utilising the potential of energy consumption structure transformation at households in Poland that cannot afford such an expense. This is where the energy policy meets the social policy” – he argued.
“When considering financing the energy sector we have to separate these issues. Funds for the infrastructure and those for social spending should not be mixed together” – assessed Ralf Wezel, Secretary General of German EUTurbines organisation. “The lesson from Germany shows that the energy policy must be credible and predictable. It may be improved by meeting the obligations but not by their extension in time or adding other goals that are contradictory. We have to be credible; otherwise, no one will invest in our assets”.
“The gas power plants provide fast decarbonisation” – admitted Mr Wezel. “This will not be a dependency on fossil fuels as such power plants can also be fired with biogas. We already have discussions about renewable gas. A gas-fired power plant may be adapted to burn it. Investing in gas does not lead to dependency on emissions” – he summed up.
“With the current state of development of energy storage, it is not possible to transition the entire generation to sun and wind and to abandon conventional sources. The most stable sources remain to be nuclear and coal that are not very popular with the European Union. The USA, Japan and Australia are developing clean carbon technologies” – countered director Jagoda. Related posts:"
Polish Briefing: No strike in Sierra Gorda. Orlen and PKP Cargo will deepen the cooperation,biznesalert.com,admin5,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://biznesalert.com/sierra-gorda-orlen-paliwa-pkp-cargo/,"Polish Briefing 5 April, 2019 9: Polish Briefing: No strike in Sierra Gorda. Orlen and PKP Cargo will deepen the cooperation
What goes on in Poland on the 5th of April. There will be no strike in Sierra Gorda
KGHM came to an agreement with the trade unions in the Sierra Gorda mine in Chile.
– Many years of experiences in dialogue with trade unions on various continents pays dividends. We treat employees with respect, and we develop solutions that are good for the entire company. Employees value this attitude, said Marcin Chludziński, the President of KGHM Polska Miedź SA in BiznesAlert.pl. – I do not hide, that there was a risk of strike. We have defused it, coming to an understanding, he assured.
The three trade unions operating in Sierra Gorda have signed an agreement that will be valid for the next three years. The Chilean law guarantees trade unions the possibility of renegotiating a collective agreement. KGHM informed that it operates in cooperation with Sumitomo Metal Mining and Sumitomo Corporation, who co-own the mine. Orlen Paliwa and PKP Cargo will deepen the cooperation to create a synergy
At the Warsaw headquarters of PKN Orlen, Orlen Paliwa and PKP Cargo signed letter of intent.
The companies have been working together from before and the intention of the document which was signed yesterday was to express willingness to deepen the cooperation between both companies in order to achieve synergy.
– This is a meeting of two leaders in their industries. This is a symbolic moment of intensification of our cooperation which will be boosted in different areas. Results of synergy will be very meaningful and they will bring dividends to both companies as well as to Polish economy, said Czesław Warsewicz, the President of PKP Cargo.
– PKP Cargo is our largest fuel carrier, and we are their largest supplier. We are talking about combining our strengths and know-how so that the cooperation does not have the character of buying and selling, but optimization, which will have a bearing on costs. Half of the PKP Cargo locomotives are diesel, we are going to ensure that the fuel is of the highest quality, said Łukasz Hołubowski, president of Orlen Paliwa. Related posts:"

I don’t think you can separate King Solomon’s warning about strange women in Proverbs 7 from the worst sin of his father’s life – adultery followed by murder to cover it up. I am sure Solomon knew well the danger that brings.
Which is why it is all the more sad that it was Solomon’s wives that led to his own downfall when they enticed him to worship demons. Share this:"

These 'Women Talking' Build Their Own Faith And Future,www.gpb.org,Lily Meyer,04-06-2019,2019,4,http://www.gpb.org/post/these-women-talking-build-their-own-faith-and-future,"By Lily Meyer • 19 hours ago
The Canadian writer Miriam Toews opens her astonishing eighth novel, Women Talking , with a matter-of-fact Author's Note. Between 2005 and 2009, she explains, eight men in a remote Mennonite colony in Bolivia raped many of the girls and women in their community, first rendering them unconscious with cow anesthetic. Women Talking is ""both a reaction through fiction to these true-life events, and an act of female imagination."" It is also a work of deep moral intelligence, a master class in ethics beautifully dressed as a novel. And, surprisingly given the title, Women Talking is narrated by a man.
Toews opens her novel after the rapes have been discovered. Peters, the colony's monstrous bishop, has had the rapists arrested to protect them from the women's rage, then issued an ultimatum: ""When the perpetrators return, the women of Molotschna will be given the opportunity to forgive these men, thus guaranteeing everybody's place in heaven ... [Otherwise] the women will have to leave the colony for the outside world.""
The women delegate this unbearable choice to two families, the Friesens and the Loewens. Each family brings a mother, two adult daughters, and a teenage daughter or niece to the negotiations, which take place in a dementia-addled farmer's barn. Ona Friesen, who belongs to the middle generation, in turn invites the town outcast, August Epp, to serve as scribe. She wants the meeting recorded for posterity, and in Molotschna, only men can learn to read and write. 'Women Talking' reverses the patriarchal structure under which these women live ... Now, women's ideas are the center, and they get to make a man write them down. -
I will admit to some skepticism when August introduced himself, formally and modestly (""My name is August Epp — irrelevant for all purposes, other than that I've been appointed the minute-taker for the women's meetings"") on the novel's first page. Despite the beauty of Toews' prose and the constant, delicate humor of August's self-effacing perspective, I resisted him, and by extension the novel, for as long as I could. Why, I kept thinking, is a man telling this story? Why can't the women tell it themselves? But soon I understood: Women Talking reverses the patriarchal structure under which these women live. Until this moment, intellectual discourse in Molotschna has been reserved for men. Now, women's ideas are the center, and they get to make a man write them down.
August, it turns out, earns his keep. As a narrator, he occupies a space similar to Nick Carraway in The Great Gatsby or Nelly Dean in Wuthering Heights . As a character, he has the sweet, hopeless sincerity of Motherless Brooklyn 's Lionel Essrog. That sweetness becomes crucial, since it gives the novel a pressure valve. When the women's rage and grief grows unbearable, August guides readers gently away.
Those breaks are important, because though Toews' writing is simple and often funny, her ideas are difficult in the extreme. Women Talking works like a Socratic dialogue, the Republic moved to a Mennonite barn. The Friesen and Loewen women become architects of their own theology. They have no other choice; in order to come to a decision, they must reconcile Mennonite belief with the reality of Molotschna, a town in which they can never be truly safe. On the one hand, they want to go to heaven; on the other, how can they forgive the men who raped them, their daughters, their friends?
Agata Friesen, one of the matriarchs, is the first to figure it out. If the women stay, she says, they would ""knowingly be placing ourselves in a direct collision course with violence, perpetrated by us or against us ... By staying in Molotschna we would be bad Mennonites. We would be sinners, according to our faith, and we would be denied entry to heaven.""
This is the core of Women Talking . As the novel progresses, the women discard ""the male interpretation of the Bible and how that [has been] 'handed down.'"" They replace it with a female interpretation, which they hand down to August Epp. Here, too, August proves his importance. Because he is there to take minutes, the women are able to speak not only to each other, but to the future. 'Women Talking' is a profoundly intelligent book. It is an indictment of authority and a defense of belief. -
As the novel progresses, the women become increasingly conscious of that future. They begin arguing fiercely over word choice, striving not only for clarity, but for precision. Toews' emphasis on names and definitions serves to highlight how precise her own writing is, and how smart. The intelligence on display in Women Talking is as ferocious as it is warm.
Women Talking is a profoundly intelligent book. It is an indictment of authority and a defense of belief. Listening to the women pray, August thinks, ""I remember how my father ... told me that the twin pillars that guard the entrance to the shrine of religion are storytelling and cruelty."" Toews leaves the first pillar where it is, but there is no cruelty here. In the half-abandoned barn that becomes these women's shrine, storytelling is a collective act, and religion survives only through generosity. If only more of the world worked the same way.

'We Don't Have Enough Women In Power': Notre Dame Coach Muffet McGraw Goes Viral,www.gpb.org,James Doubek,04-06-2019,2019,4,http://www.gpb.org/post/we-dont-have-enough-women-power-notre-dame-coach-muffet-mcgraw-goes-viral,"By James Doubek • 19 hours ago Originally published on April 7, 2019 2:37 am
Muffet McGraw, the two-time championship-winning head coach of women's basketball at the University of Notre Dame, was dancing a jig and celebrating Friday night after leading her team to victory over the University of Connecticut.
The NCAA women's basketball championship game is now set for Sunday — setting up a possible third win for McGraw — with the reigning national champion Notre Dame's Fighting Irish taking on No. 1 seed the Lady Bears of Baylor University.
But this past Thursday, McGraw's mood was more serious when answering a question about her recently reported commitment to never hire another male coach for her staff.
She began talking about the decades that the Equal Rights Amendment has gone without ratification: ""We need 38 states to agree that discrimination on the basis of sex is unconstitutional. We've had a record number of women running for office and winning. And still, we have 23 percent of the House and 25 percent of the Senate."" Muffet McGraw: A voice for women. — NCAA WBB (@ncaawbb) April 4, 2019
McGraw was responding to a question about being the ""voice"" of female coaches in college athletics after University of Tennessee coach Pat Summitt, who won 1,098 games with the Lady Volunteers for more than 38 years, died in 2016.
McGraw's two-minute response, touching on the long history of sexism in many American institutions, went viral.
""I'm getting tired of the novelty of ... the first female governor of this state. The first female African-American mayor of this city,"" she said. ""When is it going to become the norm instead of the exception? How are these young women looking up and seeing someone that looks like them, preparing them for the future? We don't have enough female role models. We don't have enough visible women leaders. We don't have enough women in power.""
She said girls are socialized to think ""men run the world."" Where better to counter that narrative than in sports, she asked.
""When you look at men's basketball and 99 percent of the jobs go to men, why shouldn't 100 or 99 percent of the jobs in women's basketball go to women? Maybe it's because we only have 10 percent women athletic directors in Division I. People hire people who look like them. And that's the problem.""
In 1972, Title IX enacted gender equity policies in student athletics as part of a law. Two years later, more than 90 percent of women's teams in college sports had female coaches, according to the Tucker Center for Research on Girls & Women in Sport at the University of Minnesota.
That number has fallen drastically. The center's newest report based on data from last year found the percentage of female head coaches had increased slightly from previous years, but only to 41.8 percent. The group took data from 86 institutions that were part of the NCAA Division I ""big time"" conferences.
In basketball specifically, the percent of women coaching women was 59.3 in 2018.
Notre Dame player Jessica Shepard responded to McGraw, ""Talk that talk then coach."" Notre Dame forward Brianna Turner , who scored her 2,000th career point Friday, just wrote on Twitter: ""Take notes.""
Samantha Brunelle, a high-profile incoming recruit to Notre Dame, tweeted the video of McGraw's answer, saying it was ""one of the many reasons why Notre Dame was the place for me.""
""I aspire to be like her one day,"" Brunelle told the South Bend Tribune of South Bend, Ind. ""She stands for women so much. She has a huge voice to help give us women more of a platform."" Clarification: 4/05/19
In an earlier version of this story, we quote Muffet McGraw as saying the Equal Rights Amendment was introduced in 1967. A version of the amendment was first introduced in 1923, and it was reintroduced in subsequent years. The draft of the amendment approved by Congress in 1972 remains just shy of full ratification by the states. Copyright 2019 NPR.

Crowds Linger On The Slopes With Cheaper Ski Pass — But Locals Aren't Happy,www.gpb.org,Ben Bergman,04-06-2019,2019,4,http://www.gpb.org/post/crowds-linger-slopes-cheaper-ski-pass-locals-arent-happy,"Crowds Linger On The Slopes With Cheaper Ski Pass — But Locals Aren't Happy By editor • 20 hours ago Related Program: A crowded opening day at Arapahoe Basin Ski Area in Keystone, Colo. Doug Pensinger / Getty Images / Originally published on April 6, 2019 2:09 pm
On a recent 50-degree bluebird day at Big Bear Mountain outside Los Angeles, skiers in short sleeves partied with loud music and beer and bragged about how many days they have spent at the mountain this season.
""It's been at least 10,"" said Daniella Gogatz.
""This is day 31,"" said Ken Ryan. ""It's cost me about $20 or less a day at this point.""
While the prices of ski lift passes have been skyrocketing, the industry has been embracing new multiresort season passes that are cheaper than ever. They've proven popular though also controversial.
Gogatz and Ryan are able to afford to ski so much because they bought Ikon passes, which were just introduced this season by the the Alterra Mountain Company.
Ikon is priced starting at around $600 and includes access to dozens of resorts and some of the most famous ski mountains in the world, including Aspen, Jackson Hole and Deer Valley.
Ikon, and its main competitor, The Epic Pass, which was introduced a decade ago, have made it possible to ski for an entire season for what you could spend on a three-day lift ticket, as long as you commit early.

""We're seeing more people on the hill and longer lift lines and whenever you're waiting in one of those lines you'll hear some local quip about the Ikon passholders,"" said Matt Maydick, who lives in Carbondale, Colo., right outside Aspen.
Maydick, himself an Ikon passholder, says he is happy more people are getting to enjoy his favorite sport but he is frustrated by the growing pains.
Ikon passholders have been accused of not only making the mountain too crowded but also of being in over their heads.
There has been more hostility in Jackson Hole. When Joe Cascia of New Jersey visited recently, he encountered a local who griped about Ikon passholders for being cheap and not spending enough at local restaurants.
""I'm not sure why he would seen that as a negative, because I think everybody should be trying to save money,"" said Cascia, who said he pointed out that he had just spent almost $200 on dinner.
Cascia's girlfriend usually proudly displays her Ikon pass on her helmet but at Jackson Hole he thought it would be better for her to hide it.
""I even told her you might want to put that in your pocket here because it just didn't feel 100 percent welcome,"" Cascia said.
Resorts have tried to ease tensions by pointing out that Ikon passholders are not the only reason for overcrowding and that resorts gain valuable revenue from the pass.
Taylor Middleton, the general manager of Big Sky Resort in Montana, even penned an open editorial to local residents ordering them to be nicer.
""Recently, local social media channels are revealing a rash of really negative postings, shunning new visitors and treating new arrivals differently than we were treated ourselves,"" wrote Middleton. ""We were all new at some point; these guests are our newest visitors.""
In fact, Ikon passholders only account for a small increase in the number of visitors at most resorts this season. The biggest reason for the crowds is this season's heavy snow, according to resort owners.
""I think the Ikon pass is somewhat unfairly blamed by some,"" said Middleton.
Like it or not, the pass is here to stay, according to Erik Forsell, Alterra chief marketing officer.
""We definitely launched with the idea of disrupting in a positive way the ski industry and we did,"" said Forsell.
Forsell says resorts like locking in guaranteed revenue in case of a bad snow year.
Next season's pass went on sale last month, starting at $649.

Skiing's long been an expensive sport. It's not uncommon for a lift ticket to set you back upwards of $200 a day. While the price of day passes has been rising, the industry has been embracing new multi-resort season passes that are cheaper than ever. They've proven to be popular but also controversial, as Ben Bergman reports.
BEN BERGMAN, BYLINE: On a recent 50-degree bluebird day at Big Bear Mountain outside Los Angeles, skiers in short sleeves flew down the mountain. Then it was time to party at the base with loud music, beer and bragging about how many days they've skied. Here's Daniella Gogatz.
DANIELLA GOGATZ: At least over 10.
BERGMAN: Impressive until you talk to Ken Ryan. For him, this is...
KEN RYAN: Day 31.
BERGMAN: Ryan is able to afford to ski for a month because he bought something called the Ikon Pass, which was just introduced this season. It's priced starting at around $600 and includes access to dozens of resorts, including some of the most famous mountains in the world.
RYAN: It's costing me about, so far, 20 bucks a day or less at this point.
BERGMAN: Ikon and its main competitor, Epic, have made it possible to ski for an entire season for what you could spend on a three-day lift ticket as long as you commit early. What's wrong with that? Well, plenty according to some locals who complain the passes are destroying the character of their beloved mountains. Matt Maydick lives in Carbondale, Colo., right outside Aspen.
MATT MAYDICK: We're seeing longer lift lines, more people on the hill. But whenever you're waiting in one of those lines, you'll always hear some local quip about, you know, the Ikon passholders.
BERGMAN: Not only because they make it too crowded but also that they're in over their heads on the mountain. In short, they don't deserve to be skiing Aspen's pristine powder. And there's been even more hostility in Jackson Hole. When Joe Cascia of New Jersey visited recently, he encountered a local who griped about Ikon passholders not spending enough at local restaurants, for being cheap.
JOE CASCIA: I'm not too sure why he would have saw that as a negative because I think everybody should be trying to save money.
BERGMAN: Cascia's girlfriend usually proudly displays her Ikon Pass on her helmet. At Jackson Hole...
CASCIA: I even told her, as a guy, you might want to put that in your pocket here because it just didn't feel 100 percent welcome.
BERGMAN: Resorts, on the other hand, are embracing the passes. Taylor Middleton, the head of Big Sky Resort in Montana, penned an open editorial to local residents ordering them to be nicer.
TAYLOR MIDDLETON: There's a little heat in the community.
BERGMAN: In fact, Ikon passholders only account for a small increase in the number of visitors. The biggest reason for the crowds - well, according to Middleton, it's this year's great snow.
MIDDLETON: I think the Ikon Pass is somewhat unfairly blamed by some.
BERGMAN: Like it or not, the pass is here to stay says its chief marketer, Erik Forsell of Alterra.
ERIK FORSELL: We definitely launched with the idea of disrupting in a positive way the ski industry. And we did.
BERGMAN: Forsell says resorts like locking in guaranteed revenue in case of a bad snow year. Next season's pass just went on sale, and one skier from Salt Lake City commented on the Facebook announcement you have ruined skiing. Please stop. For NPR News, I'm Ben Bergman.

Recount laws and timetables vary widely across likely 2020 swing states by 0 Comments
Poll worker Mary Ellison prepares a voting machine at the Prince Hall Masonic Lodge during the South Carolina Democratic Presidential Primary February 27, 2016 in Columbia, South Carolina. (Photo: Sean Rayford/Getty Images) If the 2020 presidential election hinges on recounts in the closest battleground states, there could be a crisis even greater than the 2000 election where the U.S. Supreme Court ended a Florida recount in its infamous Bush v. Gore ruling. The laws and timetables governing recounts in many swing states differ widely and aren’t necessarily geared toward transparent granular counting. That’s because the laws and timetables governing recounts in many swing states differ widely and aren’t necessarily geared toward transparent granular counting—and that’s apart from President Trump’s habit of attacking election outcomes he doesn’t like by claiming they were stolen. “I see what the states have put out there. They have not proven realistic,” said Matthew Weil , senior associate director of the Democracy Project at the Bipartisan Policy Center, speaking of the policies and legal landscape that unfold after election night. The BPC is soon expected to issue a report on the topic. “It would be very helpful to really look at what a realistic and rational policy would be, and we can work toward that goal.” Should presidential recounts occur, it appears that history will not repeat what happened in 2016 —when courts shut down two of the three recounts filed by the Green Party: in Michigan and Pennsylvania but not Wisconsin. But the chances of voters seeing a convincing process may prove as frustrating as 2016. “By conventional standards, the 2016 presidential recount was close, but not by recount standards,” said Chris Sautter, a nationally known lawyer specializing in post–Election Day procedures. “Nonetheless, a truly accurate recount to fully verify the results was not possible in any of the three states because laws in those states didn’t permit meaningful recounts, and because even had the laws permitted proper recounts, most of Pennsylvania and a few counties in Wisconsin did not use election equipment that produced paper records of each vote.” In 2016, three purple states tipped the Electoral College and made Trump president. Millions of Americans were stunned. The Green Party’s presidential nominee, Jill Stein, stepped into the “what happened?” void, raising $7.3 million and filing for recounts in the states with the three closest margins: Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. The recounts accomplished little of what recounts are supposed to do—validate or update the earlier results. They were blocked in Michigan, stopped in Pennsylvania after barely beginning, and, in Wisconsin, where they were completed after revealing inconsistencies in some vote-counting machinery, Trump emerged with several hundred more votes. Instead of resolving ambiguities and bringing legitimacy to the results, the narrative was dogged by suspicions of hacked machinery, slash-and-burn political rhetoric, contentious court battles and rulings, resistance to re-examining count votes by some local officials and wide media ridicule. These factors did little to satisfy Americans seeking answers. Since 2016, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin have updated some laws or counting protocols in response to the recount, but not all of those revisions are intended to open up the process. Looking more widely, most possible 2020 swing states each have different post–Election Day rules, counting timetables and deadlines, some of which are hard to meet without squeezing in a thorough recount. Since 2016, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin have updated some laws or counting protocols in response to the recount, but not all of those revisions are intended to open up the process. With the possible exception of Florida , most of the several dozen recount-related bills now in legislatures were not from likely presidential battleground states, heading toward passage, nor involved big changes. Or, as in Arizona, there’s a proposed bill to make it more expensive to file for a recount if it’s not automatic—a deterrent to recounting. Many voters do not realize that elections don’t end on election night, where the reported totals are unofficial and incomplete. After all of the ballots are collected and machinery is packed up, a process called the canvass begins. This involves elected officials and civil servants, typically at the county level, compiling and reconciling the totals from their various voting options (early, at precincts, etc.) and still-arriving mailed-in votes. This process typically concludes seven or 10 days later with local certification of winners. State certification follows soon afterward. If the top contenders are less than 1 percent apart (this slightly varies state-by-state), a recount will be triggered. Depending on the margins, the government or candidates will pay for this. Recounts also follow differing rules depending on the state. Some, like in Florida, only count problematic ballots—with no votes or too many votes. (Election audits are generally not part of this phase , but occur after the election is officially over.) To choose the president, states have to finish this process before the Electoral College meets about six weeks later. But post-election timetables vary. In Michigan, the process can take no more than 40 days. In Ohio, it’s 31 days. In Wisconsin, 24 days. In Nevada and Pennsylvania, it’s 21 days. In Florida, it’s 14 days—although there is legislation to add five days. These timelines were set years ago, before large numbers of voters started voting by mail, which takes time to process, and Congress created the provisional ballot safeguard (for people not on voter lists), which also must be verified before counting. What can follow close contests can appear confusing and not inspire confidence. Before three simultaneous statewide recounts were triggered in Florida last fall, including for U.S. senator and for governor, the results kept changing as mail-in ballots came in. In Broward County, Republicans rallied outside of county offices and loudly accused the election workers inside of rigging the results. In Broward County, Palm Beach County and elsewhere, officials didn’t finish in time, which meant under law that the earlier unofficial results stood. Michigan has a similar law on the books. “It’s very weird, from a government-administration perspective, to be putting out unofficial totals, and then people are seeing them shift,” Weil said. “We now see a lot of concern—i.e., ‘Is something going on if these numbers are shifting?’ Obviously, that’s a part of the process, but I do think we need to evaluate some of those reporting policies.” The 2016 Recounts What have 2016’s closest swing states done since that year’s presidential recounts? To recap, several weeks after Election Day, the Greens filed for three recounts: In Michigan , where the results found Donald Trump led by roughly 11,000 votes; in Wisconsin , where he led by 23,000 votes; and in Pennsylvania , by 44,000 votes. What followed were political brawls. In Michigan, there was fierce pushback by the GOP, where a red-run state government, and courts at the state and federal levels shut down the process. Later studies by Michigan academics argued that Hillary Clinton would likely have won the state in a recount (but not the election) if half of Detroit’s ballots weren’t disqualified . A 1954 law disqualified ballots if the number of voters signing in at precincts did not match the reported vote total, or, as was seen in 2016, ballot storage boxes were banged up or damaged—as signs of possible tampering. Frustrations in Michigan’s governing circles with the city’s elections have kept the law on the books, retired state election officials have said. Pennsylvania saw differently dissatisfying results in 2016. A full recount never occurred, as many counties had finished the canvass before the Greens filed—including a mountain of petitions submitted at the local level. The state’s courts, a silent blue executive branch and a federal court eventually shut it down. Late last fall, Greens settled a suit with the state where it pledged to use all paper-ballots for 2020. Only Wisconsin finished its presidential recount, where Trump won 400 more votes, and counties, much to the Greens’ consternation, used different recounting methods—some scanning ballots, others counting by hand. Wisconsin and Michigan have passed laws to block filings by candidates who do not stand a chance at winning. After 2016, the American Law Institute has convened a panel of election scholars to publish an update of what it considers the best principles and legislative language for states to resolve “ballot-counting disputes.” Their detailed report delves into the canvass, recounts, and a final stage, contesting results. Its principles are clear: avoid ambiguity in the counting rules and procedures to maximize the legitimacy of the election. That means embracing a transparent process and exercising a “duty of non-partisanship” as a referee. Should presidential recounts recur in these states in 2020, there will be some differences. To start, two of these states won’t let marginal contenders file. Wisconsin and Michigan have passed laws to block filings by candidates who do not stand a chance at winning—“a good faith belief that they would have had a reasonable chance of winning,” said Shawn Starkey, communication director for Michigan’s Department of State. That policy was aimed at the next proverbial Stein, as were other changes to Michigan law. Depending on the number of votes separating the leading candidate and a petitioner, the per-precinct filing fees can range from $25 to $250, Starkey said. (Last fall, the state had 4,797 precincts, a number that fluctuates as local populations change.) Michigan also changed some deadlines in its canvass process after 2016. It gave counties one more day before starting that process after Election Day (by 9 a.m. on Thursday, not by 1 p.m. on Wednesday), but then required an “expedited” process if the presidential candidate’s lead was less than 25,000 votes statewide, he said. Counties also must report “any out-of-balance precincts that weren’t reconciled during the canvass.” The 1950s-era law that disqualified Detroit’s ballots—and would let the first unofficial results stand if a recount wasn’t finished—remains on the books, Starkey said. (In early March, a bill was introduced to amend that law; but it was sitting in a committee.) With regard to auditing the voting machinery or first tabulations, the state currently does not start those until “after the canvass process and official results certification,” he said. In other words, Michigan has not made recounting an easier or more open process. Wisconsin and Pennsylvania Wisconsin’s GOP-run government also blocked future Green-style recounts after 2016. But its state election agency, the Wisconsin Election Commission (WEC), has since taken steps to make results more trustworthy before officially declaring winners. Before the November 2018 election, the WEC doubled the number of wards—the most local election jurisdiction—required to double check their preliminary results, “including at least one in each of the 72 counties,” said WEC spokesman Reid Magney. “Wisconsin has several different makes and models of voting equipment in use, and each type will be audited at least five times.” Those audits, which involved manually reviewing and counting votes, looked at 135,712 ballots in November, a March 11 report submitted to the WEC said, noting that “was the largest audit of its kind undertaken in the State of Wisconsin.” The report said that the “only noted issue arose” when an older touch-screen electronic voting system used in rural counties saw jams of printers that were supposed to produce a paper record. “The audit results indicated there were no identifiable bugs, errors, or failure of the tabulation voting equipment,” the report said. “While there were discrepancies identified during the audit, they were the result of human error that occurred as part of the process conducting the audit. Additionally, the results of the audit did not identify programming errors that impacted how the audited voting equipment counted votes.” The WEC could not order every county to participate in its pre-certification audits, said Magney. But nine counties took part, he said, including some of the biggest population centers. If Wisconsin held the key to who would prevail in 2020’s presidential election, it’s possible an absence of consistent statewide protocols could become an issue in post-election litigation. But Wisconsin has made the process more accountable than what existed in 2016, even though marginal candidates can no longer file for a recount. In Pennsylvania, the prospective presidential 2020 recount landscape is not yet clear. In Pennsylvania, the prospective presidential 2020 recount landscape is not yet clear. Last November, the state settled a lawsuit with the Greens where it pledged to replace all of its voting machinery before 2020’s election with paper ballot–based voting systems. (There’s an open question if electronic ballot-marking devices, which some counties are acquiring and critics say can be hacked, would violate that settlement. The Greens’ attorney did not return a request for comment.) That settlement also requires the state to implement pre-certification audits by 2021; however, that would be after the next presidential election. Stepping back, Pennsylvania is undergoing a makeover of its voting systems and rules. In July 2018, Gov. Tom Wolf, a Democrat, announced the state was stepping up cybersecurity surrounding election systems. The current legislative session has numerous bills introduced to open up the voting process, primarily by joining other states that use voting by mail and vote centers. There are no recount-related bills, however. Compared to the latest policies in Wisconsin, the state’s recount laws are fairly strict. Pennsylvania’s recounts are triggered if the leading candidate’s margin is less than 0.5 percent, and it has to take place by the third Wednesday after Election Day and completed by the next Tuesday—a tight 21-day window. A state elections agency spokeswoman said it was too soon to say what changes might be coming before 2020. “It’s a little too early for us to predict what changes are coming in Pennsylvania in 2020,” Ellen Lyon, deputy director of the office of communications and press for its Department of State, said. “Several state legislators have election reform bills out there, in addition to the governor’s plan, but they haven’t been acted on yet.” Other Swing States Perhaps most notable is what may unfold in Florida, where several bills are moving that would make any recount, including for president, more thorough and transparent. There’s legislation to extend its recounting period, because last November several counties could not finish their recounts in time. There is also legislation to allow the most granular vote auditing system now available to be used in recounts. That approach rescans every paper ballot and then compares those results to earlier tabulations. Should this bill pass and be signed into law, Florida would be in a class by itself among swing states for recounts. In state after state, regulations and timetables can be out of sync with the pragmatic details of conducting modern elections. But stepping back from that prospect, the big picture surrounding the nation’s vote verification landscape is uneven, as the Bipartisan Policy Center’s Weil said. In state after state, regulations and timetables can be out of sync with the pragmatic details of conducting modern elections. The BPC has convened three task forces to improve the “voting experience,” with one focused on vote counting. Weil said the goal is making elections more trustworthy, not making do with today’s status quo. “There are a lot of people out there helping election officials work within the system that exists in their state, and fewer looking at the policies that are clearly prescribing what their options are—and maybe those options are not the best options,” Weil said. “I think we need to make sure that the laws line up to ensure that election officials are fully successful, because at this point in a lot of states, either they are pushing up against the laws, or they have resigned themselves to the fact that their laws are never going to allow them to do what makes the voting experience better.” Will the vote counting landscape be better in 2020 if there are presidential recounts? As Kevin Kennedy, Wisconsin’s retired state election director, said, “Unless it’s a very close election, nobody’s paying attention.” But if there is a contested outcome, by the time the canvassing and recounting begins, it would be too late to improve the process.

Standardized Testing is a Tool of White Supremacy,www.commondreams.org,,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.commondreams.org/views/2019/04/06/standardized-testing-tool-white-supremacy,"Standardized Testing is a Tool of White Supremacy
It's time to treat all our children fairly. It's time to hang up the tests by
""What is a standardized test but an assessment that refers to a specific standard? And that standard is white, upper class students."" (Photo: Pixabay/cc)
Let’s say you punched me in the face.
I wouldn’t like it. I’d protest. I’d complain.
And then you might apologize and say it was just an accident.
Maybe I’d believe you.
Until the next time when we met and you punched me again.
That’s the problem we, as a society, have with standardized tests.
We keep using them to justify treating students of color as inferior and/or subordinate to white children. And we never stop or even bothered to say, “I’m sorry.”
Fact: black kids don’t score as high on standardized tests as white kids .
It’s called the racial achievement gap and it’s been going on for nearly a century.
Today we’re told that it means our public schools are deficient. There’s something more they need to be doing.
But if this phenomenon has been happening for nearly 100 years , is it really a product of today’s public schools or a product of the testing that identifies it in the first place?
After all, teachers and schools have changed. They no longer educate children today the same way they did in the 1920s when the first large scale standardized tests were given to students in the U.S. There are no more one-room schoolhouses. Kids can’t drop out at 14. Children with special needs aren’t kept in the basement or discouraged from attending school. Moreover, none of the educators and administrators on the job during the Jazz Age are still working.
Instead, we have robust buildings serving increasingly larger and more diverse populations . Students stay in school until at least 18. Children with special needs are included with their peers and given a multitude of services to meet their educational needs. And that’s to say nothing of the innovations in technology, pedagogy and restorative justice discipline policies.
But standardized testing ? That hasn’t really changed all that much. It still reduces complex processes down to a predetermined set of only four possible answers—a recipe good for guessing what a test-maker wants more than expressing a complex answer about the real world. It still attempts to produce a bell curve of scores so that so many test takers fail, so many pass, so many get advanced scores, etc. It still judges correct and incorrect by reference to a predetermined standard of how a preconceived “typical” student would respond.
Considering how and why such assessments were created in the first place , the presence of a racial achievement gap should not be surprising at all. That’s the result these tests were originally created to find.
Modern testing comes out of Army IQ tests developed during World War I.
In 1917, a group of psychologists led by Robert M. Yerkes, president of the American Psychological Association (APA), created the Army Alpha and Beta tests . These were specifically designed to measure the intelligence of recruits and help the military distinguish those of “superior mental ability” from those who were “mentally inferior.”
These assessments were based on explicitly eugenicist foundations—the idea that certain races were distinctly superior to others.
In 1923, one of the men who developed these intelligence tests, Carl Brigham, took these ideas further in his seminal work A Study of American Intelligence . In it, he used data gathered from these IQ tests to argue the following:
The decline of American intelligence will be more rapid than the decline of the intelligence of European national groups, owing to the presence here of the negro. These are the plain, if somewhat ugly, facts that our study shows. The deterioration of American intelligence is not inevitable, however, if public action can be aroused to prevent it.
People took this research very seriously . States passed forced sterilization laws for people with “defective” traits, preventing between 60,000 and 70,000 people from “polluting” America’s ruling class. The practice was even upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in the 1927 Buck v. Bell decision. Justices decided that mandatory sterilization of “feeble-minded” individuals was, in fact, constitutional.
Of the ruling, which has never been explicitly overturned, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote: “It is better for all the world, if instead of waiting to execute degenerate offspring for crime, or to let them starve for their imbecility, society can prevent those who are manifestly unfit from continuing their kind. ...Three generations of imbeciles are enough.”
Eventually Brigham took his experience with Army IQ tests to create a new assessment for the College Board —the Scholastic Aptitude Test—now known as the Scholastic Assessment Test or SAT . It was first given to high school students in 1926 as a gatekeeper. Just as the Army intelligence tests were designed to distinguish the superior from the inferior, the SAT was designed to predict which students would do well in college and which would not. It was meant to show which students should be given the chance at a higher education and which should be left behind.
And unsurprisingly it has always—and continues to—privilege white students over children of color.
The SAT remains a tool for ensuring white supremacy that is essentially partial and unfair—just as its designers always meant it to be. Moreover, it is the model by which all other high stakes standardized tests are designed.
But Brigham was not alone in smuggling eugenicist ideals into the education field . These ideas dominated pedagogy and psychology for generations until after World War II when their similarity to the Nazi philosophy we had just defeated in Europe dimmed their exponents’ enthusiasm.
Another major eugenicist who made a lasting impact on education was Lewis Terman , Professor of Education at Stanford University and originator of the Stanford-Binet intelligence test. In his highly influential 1916 textbook, The Measurement of Intelligence he wrote:
Among laboring men and servant girls there are thousands like them [feebleminded individuals]. They are the world’s “hewers of wood and drawers of water.” And yet, as far as intelligence is concerned, the tests have told the truth. …No amount of school instruction will ever make them intelligent voters or capable voters in the true sense of the word.
...The fact that one meets this type with such frequency among Indians, Mexicans, and negroes suggests quite forcibly that the whole question of racial differences in mental traits will have to be taken up anew and by experimental methods.
Children of this group should be segregated in special classes and be given instruction which is concrete and practical. They cannot master, but they can often be made efficient workers, able to look out for themselves. There is no possibility at present of convincing society that they should not be allowed to reproduce, although from a eugenic point of view they constitute a grave problem because of their unusually prolific breeding (91-92).
This was the original justification for academic tracking . Terman and other educational psychologists convinced many schools to use high-stakes and culturally-biased tests to place “slow” students into special classes or separate schools while placing more advanced students of European ancestry into the college preparatory courses.
The modern wave of high stakes testing has its roots in the Reagan administration—specifically the infamous propaganda hit piece A Nation at Risk: The Imperative for Education Reform .
In true disaster capitalism style , it concluded that our economy was at risk because of poor public schools. Therefore, it suggested circumventing the schools and subordinating them to a system of standardized tests, which would be used to determine everything from teacher quality to resource allocation.
It’s a bizarre argument, but it goes something like this: the best way to create and sustain a fair educational system is by rewarding “high-achieving” students.
So we shouldn’t provide kids with what they need to succeed. We should make school a competition where the strongest get the most and everyone else gets a lesser share.
And the gatekeeper in this instance (as it was in access to higher education) is high stakes testing. The greater the test score, the more funding your school receives, the lower class sizes, the wider curriculum, more tutors, more experienced and well compensated teachers, etc.
It’s a socially stratified education system completely supported by a pseudoscientific series of assessments.
After all, what is a standardized test but an assessment that refers to a specific standard? And that standard is white, upper class students. In his book How the SAT Creates Built-in-Headwinds , national admissions-test expert, Jay Rosner, explains the process by-which SAT designers decide which questions to include on the test:
Compare two 1998 SAT verbal [section] sentence-completion items with similar themes: The item correctly answered by more blacks than whites was discarded by [the Educational Testing Service] (ETS), whereas the item that has a higher disparate impact against blacks became part of the actual SAT. On one of the items, which was of medium difficulty, 62 percent of whites and 38 percent of African Americans answered correctly, resulting in a large impact of 24 percent... On this second item, 8 percent more African Americans than whites answered correctly.
In other words, the criteria for whether a question is chosen for future tests is if it replicates the outcomes of previous exams—specifically tests where students of color score lower than white children. And this is still the criteria test makers use to determine which questions to use on future editions of nearly every assessment in wide use in the U.S.
Some might argue that this isn’t racist because race was not explicitly used to determine which questions would be included. Yet the results are exactly the same as if it were.
Others want to reduce the entire enterprise to one of social class. It’s not students of color that are disadvantaged—it’s students living in poverty. And there is overlap here.
But this isn’t an either/or situation. It’s both. Standardized testing has always been about BOTH race and class . They are inextricably entwined.
Which leads to the question of intention.
If these are the results, is there some villain laughing behind the curtain and twirling the ends of a handlebar mustache?
Answer: it doesn’t matter.
As in the entire edifice of white supremacy, intention is beside the point . These are the results. This is what a policy of high stakes standardized testing actually does.
If every time we meet, you punch me in the face, it doesn’t matter if that’s because you hate me or you’re just clumsy. You’re responsible for changing your actions.
And we as a society are responsible for changing our policies.
Nearly a century of standardized testing is enough.
It’s time to stop the bludgeoning.
It’s time to treat all our children fairly.
It’s time to hang up the tests. This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 License This is the world we live in. This is the world we cover.

HEALTH CARE PUSH NOT OVER … NANCY COOK: “White House acting chief-of-staff MICK MULVANEY is convening a meeting at Camp David this weekend with top White House staffers and key Cabinet members to talk through the administration’s direction on health care, according to a senior administration official.
“The meeting is not intended to produce a proposal or plan but instead is a chance for top officials to brainstorm ideas roughly two weeks after Trump ordered his administration to ask a federal court to invalidate the Affordable Care Act. Senate Republicans have little interest in developing any type of replacement plan before the 2020 election, but several administration officials say Trump sees it as a campaign issue Republicans should not shy away from.”
NEW: 2020 WATCH -- ON THE GROUND: NATASHA KORECKI tells us that there is a behind-the-scenes staffing tug-of-war in IOWA between JOE BIDEN and PETE BUTTIGIEG that likely will happen in other states as well. As both near officially entering the race, they are late to the operative game.
SENS. ELIZABETH WARREN and CORY BOOKER laid the earliest organizational groundwork and others who have joined the field have scooped up top flight hires. One Democratic consultant told her that while Buttigieg is capturing a new wave of excitement, Biden could have the upper hand because of long-term loyalties and relationships.
MORE BIDEN … NYT’S JONATHAN MARTIN and ALEX BURNS: “Biden Didn’t Rush Into 2020. The Race Came to Him Anyway.”
-- THE DAILY MAIL -- “EXCLUSIVE: ‘He was always holding my hand, putting his arm around me, brushing the hair from my face.’ Jill Biden admits Joe — and his VERY handsy family -- made her feel ‘strange and uncomfortable’ when they first began dating in new memoir”.
TRUMP ON THE BORDER -- L.A. TIMES’ NOAH BIERMAN, MOLLY O’TOOLE and RUBEN VIVES: “Trump visits Calexico a day after retreating from threats to close U.S.-Mexico border”: “President Trump argued Friday that the nation is suffering an immigration emergency, visiting the town of Calexico and inspecting a reconstructed border fence a day after he abruptly backed down from his threats to seal the lengthy border between Mexico and the United States.
“With those threats behind him, Trump shifted gears and promised to construct 400 miles of border wall in the next two years, an unlikely benchmark for a president who has yet to build a single new mile of wall along the 2,000-mile border with Mexico. The section Trump visited Friday was a replacement of existing barrier planned during the Obama administration and paid for during Trump’s first year in office.
“‘It’s better, faster and less expensive,’ he said as he stood before a slatted 30-foot-high fence. Trump nonetheless conceded that getting money from congressional Democrats for any new wall construction was ‘like pulling teeth’ even as he projected victory in his bitter funding battles with Congress.” LA Times
MEANWHILE … “House sues Trump administration over border wall,” by Matthew Choi: “The House sued members of President Donald Trump’s administration on Friday over his emergency declaration to force funding for a border wall. The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Washington, D.C., asserts Trump's emergency acts in direct disregard of Congress’ will and disputes the president's ability to access certain funds for the wall simply by declaring an emergency.
“It names Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, acting Interior Secretary David Bernhardt and the departments they oversee. It does not name Trump as a defendant.” POLITICO
-- AND A FACT CHECK: AP’S ZEKE MILLER and JONATHAN LEMIRE: “Trump has yet to complete any new mileage of fencing or other barriers anywhere on the border, though he declared Friday that at least 400 miles of the border barrier would be erected over the next two years. His administration so far has only replaced existing fencing. Construction for that small chunk of fencing cost about $18 million, began in February 2018 and was completed in October. Plans to replace that fence date back to 2009, during President Barack Obama’s tenure.” AP
SPRINKLED IN WITH A LITTLE MIXED MESSAGING -- GABBY ORR: “Trump’s border threats jam up Pence’s trade tour”: “President Donald Trump’s announcement Thursday that he would be willing to sideline a new trilateral trade pact with Canada and Mexico — a move that would allow him to impose the auto tariffs he has been threatening to unveil — couldn’t have come at a worse time for Mike Pence.
“As Trump sat in the Oval Office, telling reporters that border security ‘is more important to me than the USMCA,’ the administration’s proposed replacement for NAFTA, his vice president was hours away from kicking off a multi-state tour to promote the renegotiated trade deal.
“The tour, which targets states that will be crucial to the president’s re-election bid, would begin in Pence’s home state of Indiana at Lamb Farms Inc., a family-run business producing a trio of crops — corn, wheat and soybeans — that have been swept up in Trump’s trade wars.” POLITICO

Good Saturday morning. IT WASN’T ALL BORDER TALK yesterday for the president. ANITA KUMAR has the goods on Trump’s evening activity: fundraising. She emailed us that health care exec LEE SAMSON hosted the event at his Beverly Hills home where tickets were $15,000 for dinner, $50,000 for a photo op and $150,000 for participation in a roundtable discussion, according to someone familiar with the event.
“About 170 people attended the event, which raised money for Trump Victory, a joint committee of his re-election campaign and the Republican National Committee, but as usual the first cut of the money goes toward his re-election campaign, which he launched earlier than any president in modern history. Trump’s predecessor, Barack Obama, was in California frequently to raise money. But Friday only marks his third visit to the state as president.” The invite
KYLE CHENEY: “Congress’ new Mueller fight: Do Dems need to begin impeachment to see secret files?”: “Do Democrats have to begin the process of impeaching President Donald Trump in order to access special counsel Robert Mueller’s secrets? That legal debate began raging inside the House Judiciary Committee on Friday after a new federal court ruling suggested that Congress’ access to some confidential evidence — like the kind obtained by Mueller — hinges on lawmakers launching a ‘judicial proceeding.’
“Republicans on the committee say the only ‘judicial proceeding’ Congress can lead is an impeachment inquiry -- a claim they say is backed up by legal precedent and history. Democrats would have to launch one against Trump if they want Mueller’s grand jury evidence, Republicans say. That interpretation would be problematic for Democratic leaders in Congress, who have little interest in launching a politically explosive impeachment process at the moment.
“Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has said it’s not worth the House’s time and other top Democrats have said it’s premature while they conduct their own investigations and await the details of Mueller’s findings.” POLITICO
THE TAX BATTLE -- “Trump lawyers issue letter fighting tax return request,” by CNN’s Pamela Brown, Jim Acosta, Betsy Klein and Jeremy Diamond: “President Donald Trump continues to hold his ground against Democratic efforts to obtain his tax returns, with one administration official telling CNN that the President and his team are willing to fight the House Democratic request all the way to the Supreme Court. …
“The official added that the administration is ‘not going to set the precedent’ of turning over tax returns for future occupants of the Oval Office, slamming the House Democrat request from Neal as ‘abuse and overreach by Congress’ and asked what’s stopping Senate Republicans from seeking House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s returns. ‘They have zero right to it,’ the official said, who added Trump has also made it clear he’s not releasing his tax returns.
“Trump has retained Arlington, Virginia-based law firm Consovoy McCarthy Park PLLC to represent him on the matter. Lawyer William Consovoy argued in a statement on Friday that the requests for Trump’s tax information ‘are not consistent with governing law, do not advance any proper legislative purpose, and threaten to interfere with the ordinary conduct of audits.’” CNN ...

TREASURY DEPARTURE LOUNGE – “Mnuchin losing two senior Treasury aides,” by Nancy Cook: “Eli Miller, chief of staff at Treasury and a former Trump campaign official, will leave the department next week, according to a staffwide email sent Friday afternoon. Close Treasury observers say Miller is expected to join the private sector. ... Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Public Affairs Tony Sayegh has also planned for months to leave by the end of May and is interviewing candidates for his replacement as the agency’s top communications official.
“Among them is Monica Crowley, a Fox News commentator who was spotted in the building Thursday afternoon. Before Trump’s inauguration, Crowley was tapped for a senior position on the National Security Council but withdrew herself from consideration after news reports surfaced about instances of plagiarism.” POLITICO

2020 WATCH: WAPO’S SEAN SULLIVAN and DAVE WEIGEL in New York: “With the most diverse presidential field ever, black voters ponder the best odds against Trump”: “More than a third of the candidates seeking the Democratic nomination for president are women. There are two black men, a Mexican American man, a Taiwanese American man and a gay man.
“Yet, in the initial phase of the 2020 race, two straight white men have emerged as the fastest fundraisers, and another has jumped to a lead in recent polls, before even announcing his candidacy. The rise of Sen. Bernie Sanders (Vt.), ex-congressman Beto O’Rourke and former vice president Joe Biden in a field with historic diversity has caused dismay among some Democrats, particularly African Americans and women hoping for a mold-breaking nominee who reflects the changing face of the party and the country.
“Black voters, particularly black women, have the potential to play a decisive role in the Democratic Party’s attempt to defeat President Trump in 2020. An inability to earn their support has dealt severe blows to past candidates — most recently Sanders in the 2016 primaries and to a lesser extent Hillary Clinton in the general election.” WaPo

SECURITY WATCH -- ERIC GELLER: “Lack of security clearances hampers federal election panel”: “Only half the members of a federal commission advising states on election threats have security clearances, raising questions about whether it can effectively help local and state officials defend against adversaries such as Russian hackers. And no members of the four-person Election Assistance Commission had clearances during the past two election cycles, including the period when Kremlin-linked hackers are suspected of mounting a range of cyberattacks against state election offices, the Democratic Party and Hillary Clinton’s campaign in 2016.
“The delay in issuing security clearances for commission members is part of a massive backlog of application approvals throughout the entire federal government. But it’s a particularly acute problem for the EAC, one of the key agencies offering guidance to state and local officials about how to protect themselves from security risks.” POLITICO
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION -- “Education Department Has Stalled on Debt Relief for Defrauded Students,” by NYT’s Erica L. Green: “The Education Department failed to approve a single application for federal student loan relief in the second half of last year, according to new department data that signals that students who claim they were cheated by their colleges cannot count on help from Washington anytime soon. The department neither approved nor denied any relief claims filed by students under the so-called borrower defense program from June to December 2018, even after a federal judge ruled that the Trump administration’s foot-dragging was illegal.
“In October, the judge ordered the Education Department to enforce a long-delayed Obama-era rule that expanded and expedited loan relief for defrauded students, many of whom attended for-profit colleges. Amid that inaction, the number of pending claims has swelled to more than 150,000 — over double the number of applications the department inherited from the previous administration.” NYT
FOR YOUR RADAR -- “U.S. to Designate Iranian Guard Corps a Foreign Terror Group,” by WSJ’s Michael R. Gordon, Warren P. Strobel and Nancy A. Youssef: “The Trump administration is preparing to designate Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a foreign terrorist organization, U.S. officials said, a step that would vastly escalate the American pressure campaign against Tehran but which has divided U.S. officials. The decision, which could be announced as early as Monday following months of deliberation, would mark the first time that an element of a foreign state has been officially designated a terrorist entity.
“National security adviser John Bolton and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have been strong proponents of the move, which is intended to help the U.S. crack down on businesses in Europe and elsewhere controlled by the IRGC, the officials said. But Pentagon officials, including Marine Gen. Joe Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, have cautioned against the move, several U.S. officials said, fearing it could lead to a backlash against U.S. forces in the region without inflicting the intended damage to the Iranian economy. Central Intelligence Agency officials have also had reservations about consequences of the decision.” WSJ

MEDIAWATCH – “Exclusive: CBS News President Tells People She Regrets Accepting the Job,” by Yashar Ali in his newsletter: “Six sources who spoke to me said that Susan Zirinsky, the newly installed CBS News president, has been telling people that she regrets taking the job as the network’s news division chief. I asked my sources if she made these remarks jokingly, as there is no doubt that Zirinsky has her hands full remaking a news division that has been ‘taking on water,’ as ‘CBS This Morning’ co-anchor Gayle King recently put it.
“Perhaps she joked, understandably, in a moment of frustration? But I was told that Zirinsky has expressed her regrets in serious tones. In an email, Zirinsky wrote: ‘I have ZERO regrets about taking this job. This is a great job and my way of dealing with the pace is with humor. Obviously, some people don’t get it. Check back with me in a year and I’ll let you know how it’s going.’” Yashar Ali

The comedian who got some flack for roasting White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders’ eyeshadow at the White House Correspondents Dinner last year, joked that President Trump probably isn’t going to the gathering again this year because he doesn’t “have a big enough spine to attend,” Variety reported.
“He’s probably just really busy. You know, he’s got to golf. And honestly I don’t know if anyone really wants to watch him eat, so I think it’s for the best,” Michelle Wolf told Variety. “You got to love someone that just can’t handle being made fun of. … I think he doesn’t have a big enough spine to attend. If a president can’t take someone making fun of them, I don’t really care about them.”
Trump told reporters on Friday that he doesn’t plan to attend the event again this year because it is “boring” and “too negative.” More News"

The Ecuador Ministry of Foreign Affairs released a statement on Friday combatting WikiLeaks claims that the embassy in London intends to expel WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange and had already arranged for his arrest, according to NBC’s translation of the statement.
The ministry said Assange has demonstrated “ingratitude and disrespect” toward Ecuador, despite the protection the Ecuadorian embassy has offered him since 2012.
“(We) have made significant expenditures to pay for his stay (and have) endured its rudeness,” the statement said of Assange and WikiLeaks, according to NBC.
WikiLeaks tweeted on Friday that Assange would be kicked out of the embassy “within ‘hours to days'” and claimed the country had made arrangements for the UK to put him under arrest. More News"
Ex-US Sen Ernest ‘Fritz’ Hollings Of South Carolina Dies At 97,talkingpointsmemo.com,Nicole Lafond,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/ex-sen-ernest-fritz-hollings-dies-97,"Ex-US Sen Ernest ‘Fritz’ Hollings Of South Carolina Dies At 97 AP By Meg Kinnard April 6, 2019 9:51 am COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — Ernest F. “Fritz” Hollings, the silver-haired Democrat who helped shepherd South Carolina through desegregation as governor and went on to serve six terms in the U.S. Senate, has died. He was 97.
Family spokesman Andy Brack, who also served at times for Hollings as spokesman during his Senate career, said Hollings died early Saturday.
Hollings, whose long and colorful political career included an unsuccessful bid for the Democratic presidential nomination, retired from the Senate in 2005, one of the last of the larger-than-life Democrats who once dominated politics in the South.
He had served 38 years and two months, making him the eighth longest-serving senator in U.S. history.
Nevertheless, Hollings remained the junior senator from South Carolina for most of his term. The senior senator was Strom Thurmond, first elected in 1954. He retired in January 2003 at age 100 as the longest-serving senator in history.
In his final Senate speech in 2004, Hollings lamented that lawmakers came to spend much of their time raising money for the next election, calling money “the main culprit, the cancer on the body politic.”
“We don’t have time for each other, we don’t have time for constituents except for the givers. … We’re in real, real trouble.”
Hollings was a sharp-tongued orator whose rhetorical flourishes in the deep accent of his home state enlivened many a Washington debate, but his influence in Washington never reached the levels he hoped.
He sometimes blamed that failure on his background, rising to power as he did in the South in the 1950s as the region bubbled with anger over segregation.
However, South Carolina largely avoided the racial violence that afflicted some other Deep South states during the turbulent 1960s.
Hollings campaigned against desegregation when running for governor in 1958. He built a national reputation as a moderate when, in his farewell address as governor, he pleaded with the legislature to peacefully accept integration of public schools and the admission of the first black student to Clemson University.
“This General Assembly must make clear South Carolina’s choice, a government of laws rather than a government of men,” he told lawmakers. Shortly afterward, Clemson was peacefully integrated.
In his 2008 autobiography, “Making Government Work,” Hollings wrote that in the 1950s “no issue dominated South Carolina more than race” and that he worked for a balanced approach.
“I was ‘Mister-In-Between. The governor had to appear to be in charge; yet the realities were not on his side,” he wrote. “I returned to my basic precept … the safety of the people is the supreme law. I was determined to keep the peace and avoid bloodshed.”
In the Senate, Hollings gained a reputation as a skilled insider with keen intellectual powers. He chaired the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee and held seats on the Appropriations and Budget committees.
But his sharp tongue and sharper wit sometimes got him in trouble. He once called Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, the “senator from the B’nai B’rith” and in 1983 referred to the presidential campaign supporters of former Sen. Alan Cranston, D-California, as “wetbacks.”
Hollings began his quest for the presidency in April 1983 but dropped out the following March after dismal showings in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Early in his Senate career, he built a record as a hawk and lobbied hard for military dollars for South Carolina, one of the poorest states in the union.
Hollings originally supported American involvement in Vietnam, but his views changed over the years as it became clear there would be no American victory.
Hollings, who made three trips to the war zone, said he learned a lesson there.
“It’s a mistake to try to build and destroy a nation at the same time,” he wrote in his autobiography, warning that America is now “repeating the same wrongheaded strategy in Iraq.”
Despite his changed views, Hollings remained a strong supporter of national defense which he saw as the main business of government.
In 1969 he drew national attention when he exposed hunger in his own state by touring several cities, helping lay the groundwork for the Women, Infants and Children, or WIC, feeding program.
A year later, his views drew wider currency with the publication of his first book “The Case Against Hunger.”
In 1982, Hollings proposed an across-the-board federal spending freeze to cut the deficit, a proposal that was a cornerstone of his failed presidential bid.
He helped create the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and write the National Coastal Zone Management Act. Hollings also attached his name to the Gramm-Rudman bill aimed at balancing the federal budget.
Hollings angered many of his constituents in 1991 when he opposed the congressional resolution authorizing President George Bush to use force against Iraq.
In his later years, port security was one of his main concerns.
As he prepared to leave office, he told The Associated Press: “People ask you your legacy or your most embarrassing moment. I never, ever lived that way. … I’m not trying to get remembered.”
He kept busy after the Senate helping the Medical University of South Carolina raise money for the cancer center which bears his name and lecturing at the new Charleston School of Law.
Hollings’ one political defeat came in 1962 when he lost in a primary to Sen. Olin Johnston. After Johnston died, Hollings won a special election in 1966 and went to the Senate at age 44, winning the first of his six full terms two years later.
Ernest Frederick Hollings was born in Charleston, South Carolina, on Jan. 1, 1922. His father was a paper products dealer but the family business went broke during the Depression.
Hollings graduated from The Citadel, the state’s military college in Charleston, in 1942. He immediately entered the Army and was decorated for his service during World War II. Back home, he earned a law degree from the University of South Carolina in 1947.
The next year, he was elected to the state House at age 26. He was elected lieutenant governor six years later and governor in 1958 at age 36.
As governor, he actively lured business, helped balance the budget for the first time since Reconstruction and improved public education.
