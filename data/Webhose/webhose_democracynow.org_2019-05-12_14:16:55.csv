Julian Assange’s Lawyers Vow to Fight His Extradition to the United States | Democracy Now!,www.democracynow.org,Democracy Now,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.democracynow.org/2019/4/12/headlines/julian_assanges_lawyers_vow_to_fight_his_extradition_to_the_united_states,"Julian Assange’s Lawyers Vow to Fight His Extradition to the United States Headline Apr 12, 2019
Attorneys for WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange are vowing to fight his possible extradition to the United States following his arrest in London. On Thursday, British police forcibly removed Assange from the Ecuadorean Embassy, where he had taken asylum for almost seven years. Soon after his arrest, U.S. authorities unsealed an indictment accusing him of conspiring with Army whistleblower Chelsea Manning, who leaked a trove of sensitive documents to WikiLeaks—including evidence of U.S. war crimes in Iraq and Afghanistan. CNN is reporting the Justice Department is expected to bring additional charges against Assange. In London, Assange’s attorney Jennifer Robinson warned the prosecution of Assange could jeopardize press freedom.
Jennifer Robinson : “This sets a dangerous precedent for all media organizations and journalists in Europe and elsewhere around the world. This precedent means that any journalist can be extradited for prosecution in the United States for having published truthful information about the United States. I’ve just been with Mr. Assange in the police cells. He wants to thank all of his supporters for their ongoing support. And he said, 'I told you so.'”
Another member of Assange’s legal team, the Spanish lawyer Baltasar Garzón, said he fears Assange may be tortured if extradited to the United States. He spoke to reporters in Madrid.
Baltasar Garzón : “Chelsea Manning was subjected to torture, as special rapporteur on torture Juan Méndez revealed at the time. So, we think it is the same case, and we have serious and founded reasons for thinking this could happen.” Topics: "
It’s Time to Tell the Truth: Israeli Journalist Gideon Levy Supports Ilhan Omar’s Critique of Israel | Democracy Now!,www.democracynow.org,,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.democracynow.org/2019/3/8/its_time_to_tell_the_truth,"Haaretz columnist and member of the newspaper’s editorial board.

AMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! I’m Amy Goodman. On Thursday, the House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed a resolution condemning anti-Semitism, anti-Muslim discrimination, white supremacy, and other forms of hate. The resolution, as initially written, was seen as a direct rebuke of Democratic Congressmember Ilhan Omar for her comments about U.S. foreign policy with Israel. The vote capped a week of intense debate among congressional Democrats about anti-Semitism and U.S. policy on Israel.
We’re joined now by three guests. In Tel Aviv, Gideon Levy, longtime Israeli journalist, Haaretz columnist, member of the newspaper’s editorial board, his latest piece headlined “Keep It Up, Ilhan Omar.” He’s also the author of The Punishment of Gaza .
Phyllis Bennis is with us in Washington, fellow at the Institute for Policy Studies, serves on the national board of Jewish Voice for Peace, her recent piece for In These Times headlined “Why False Accusations of Anti-Semitism Against Ilhan Omar Are So Harmful.”
And Remi Kanazi is with us here in New York, a Palestinian-American poet and activist, the author of a collection of poetry, Before the Next Bomb Drops: Rising Up from Brooklyn to Palestine .
We welcome you all to Democracy Now! Let’s go to Tel Aviv first. Gideon Levy, your response to the debate and the final passage of the resolution on Thursday in the House of Representatives?
GIDEON LEVY : It’s wonderful that the House deals with anti-Semitism. It’s wonderful that the House condemns anti-Semitism. Anti-Semitism should be condemned. But the context is very suspicious and very troubling. Let me be very frank with you, Amy. We have to say the truth: The Israeli lobby, the Jewish lobby, are, by far, too strong and too aggressive. It’s not good for the Jewish community. It’s not good for Israel.
What is happening now is that some kind of fresh air, some kind of new voices are emerging from Capitol Hill, raising legitimate questions about Israel, about America’s foreign policy toward Israel and about the Israeli lobby in the States. Those are very legitimate questions, and it is more than needed to raise them. But the Israeli propaganda and the Jewish propaganda in recent years made it as a systematic method, whenever anybody dares to raise questions or to criticize Israel, he is immediately and automatically labeled as anti-Semite, and then he has to shut his mouth, because after this, what can he say?
This vicious circle should be broken. And I really hope that great, great politicians, like Mrs. Omar and others, will be courageous enough to stand in front those accusations and to say, “Yes, it is legitimate to criticize Israel. Yes, it is legitimate to raise questions. And this does not mean that we are anti-Semites. We are not ready to play this game anymore, in which they shut our mouths with those accusations, which, in most of the cases, are hollow.”
AMY GOODMAN : What kind of effect does this debate—now, Ilhan Omar, Rashida Tlaib and André Carson, the three Muslim congressmembers, applauded the final resolution, saying it’s the first time that there was this anti—basically, an anti-Islamophobia resolution that was passed by the House of Representatives, of course, in addition to the anti-Semitism issue. They broadened it out. What kind of effect does this debate have in Israel? And, you know, you’re just about to have your elections. The prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, is just about to be indicted for corruption.
GIDEON LEVY : Yeah, as you probably know, Amy, the campaign in Israel deals only with one question: Netanyahu, yes or no? And many more important questions and crucial questions and fatal questions are even not being discussed.
But in any case, Mrs. Omar will be also portrayed in Israel, as in any other place in the Jewish communities, as an anti-Semite, as a dangerous woman, as an enemy of peace, an enemy of Israel, an enemy of the Jewish people. And, you know, the propaganda, this kind of propaganda, is very, very efficient.
And we just have—I just got so many emails after my last piece, and someone asked me, “How can a Jew support such a woman?” So I answered him: “Very easily. Very, very easily.” Because she seems to be courageous, and she seems to say the truth.
And it’s about time to say the truth, and, yes, Amy, to ask: Do we support automatically and blindly the occupation? Is it legitimate to criticize the occupation? Maybe it is legitimate to handle Israel as South Africa was handled. Maybe BDS is something that we should consider. Those questions are even not legitimate to raise in the United States. And maybe now this vicious circle will be broken, and people will have the courage, the guts and the power to ask questions. Yes, everything is questioned. Even God is questionable.
So, the relations with Israel is not questionable? I saw the other day a congressman say that nobody should question the relations between the United States and Israel. Excuse me? Nobody should question the relations between Israel and the United States? Here, from Tel Aviv, I claim that those relationships are corrupted and are bad for peace and bad for Israel for the long run, because the United States let Israel go crazy, continue the occupation, do whatever it wants, and gets this automatic and blind support.

Chomsky: CIA Targeting of Julian Assange of WikiLeaks is “Disgraceful Act” | Democracy Now!,www.democracynow.org,,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.democracynow.org/2017/4/26/chomsky_cia_targeting_of_julian_assange,"Transcript This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.
AMY GOODMAN : Noam, I wanted to, before we get to your book, your latest book, ask you about this latest development in the United States. The director of the Central Intelligence Agency gave his first major address, and he focused on WikiLeaks. And it looks like now the U.S. is preparing an arrest warrant for Julian Assange, who’s been holed up in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London for almost five years now. Pompeo calling WikiLeaks a “hostile non-state intelligence service,” calling Julian Assange himself a “demon,” and said he’s not protected by the First Amendment. Your thoughts?
NOAM CHOMSKY : Well, I think it speaks for itself. WikiLeaks has released lots of information that governments don’t like. It’s overwhelmingly information that citizens should have. It’s information about what their governments are doing. And perfectly natural that systems of power don’t want to be exposed, so they’ll do what they can to prevent exposure. I think it’s a disgraceful act. In fact, I think it’s disgraceful even to keep Julian Assange holed up in the Ecuadorean Embassy. I did visit him there once, but you can guess yourself. It’s, in many ways, worse than imprisonment. At least if you’re in prison, you can see other prisoners, and you can get out and look at the sunshine now and then. He’s in a small apartment, where he can’t go out. You know, he can go to the balcony, but that’s about it, a small—basically, a couple of rooms inside a small apartment. It’s not a big embassy. The embassy is like a kind of an apartment in London, surrounded by police and so on. There’s been no credible basis for any of this. And to go on to try to raise it to the level of criminal prosecutions, I think, is, again, one of these efforts to look tough at home, and the kind of effort that a government would carry out that is dedicated to trying to protect itself from exposure of facts that citizens should have, but systems of power don’t want them to have. I think that’s the crucial issue.
AMY GOODMAN : The suggestions are it has to do with his aiding and abetting perhaps Chelsea Manning and also Edward Snowden, doing that with Edward Snowden, which he openly admits, while he’s trapped in the Ecuadorean Embassy.
NOAM CHOMSKY : If the charge is true, he should be honored for it. Chelsea Manning and Edward Snowden carried out heroic, courageous acts. They fulfilled the responsibility of somebody who takes citizenship seriously—that is, who believes that the people of a country ought to know something about what their government is up to. OK? Like if their government is carrying out murderous, brutal attacks in Iraq, people should know about it. Takes us back to Martin Luther King’s talk in 1967. If the government is, and corporations, too, incidentally, are listening in to your telephone conversations and what you’re doing, you know, tapping this discussion and so on, we should know about it. Governments have no right to do things like that. And people should know about it. And if they think it’s OK, fine, let them decide, not do it in secret. And I think people wouldn’t agree to it. That’s why it’s kept secret. Why else keep it secret? You know? And these are people who exposed it at great risk to themselves. So those are heroic, courageous acts. If WikiLeaks was abetting them, more power to them. That’s what they should be doing.
AMY GOODMAN : I mean, President Trump endorsed WikiLeaks, right? He said, “I love WikiLeaks,” during the campaign.
NOAM CHOMSKY : Yeah, when it was releasing things that he liked, yeah. Any system of power will do that. “You release information that I like, it’s great. But I don’t want to be exposed.”
AMY GOODMAN : That’s MIT professor Noam Chomsky speaking on Monday at the First Parish Church in Cambridge. To see our full conversation , go to democracynow.org.
That does it for our show. I’ll be speaking at Middlebury College in Vermont today at noon, then on to the Vermont College of Fine Arts in Montpelier at 7:00.

Allan Nairn: Indonesian General Tied to Mass Killings Plots to Arrest Critics If He Wins Presidency,www.democracynow.org,mail@democracynow.org (Democracy Now!),04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.democracynow.org/2019/4/15/allan_nairn_indonesian_general_tied_to," Goodman, as we turn to Indonesia ahead of Wednesday’s national presidential elections. Indonesia is the world’s largest Muslim nation, third-largest democracy in the world behind India and the United States. Indonesian President Joko Widodo, better known as “Jokowi,” is up re-election Wednesday. His chief rival, Prabowo Subianto, a former special forces military commander, the former son-in-law of Indonesia’s longtime dictator Suharto. It’s a rematch of the 2014 election that Jokowi won by almost 6 percentage points.
Investigative journalist Allan Nairn has just uncovered shocking plans made by Prabowo for if he wins the presidency. According to minutes of a campaign strategy session obtained by Allan Nairn, Prabowo has made plans to stage opponents, as well as his current allies. Nairn reports Prabowo also wants to restore Indonesia’s Army to the role it played in the U.S.-backed Suharto dictatorship, which lasted from '67 to ’98. Allan Nairn now joins us from Indonesia. He's just published his latest report on his website, AllanNairn.org.
Allan, welcome back to Democracy Now! Talk about the significance of this election on Wednesday and what you’ve just uncovered.
ALLAN NAIRN : Thanks. Good to be with you.
The general, Prabowo, who has a real chance to be elected president, is the single most notorious massacre general in Indonesia. He has been associated with more mass killings of civilians than any other officer. He is also the officer who was the closest protégé of the U.S. government, working directly, during his career, with the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency and U.S. Special Forces. He told me this in 2001, when we had two long discussions between adversaries. His statements about how he brought in U.S. troops into Indonesia and how they used the opportunity in Indonesia to do what he called recon for the invasion contingency—namely, they used the chance that Prabowo gave them to make contingency plans for a theoretical potential U.S. invasion of Indonesia in the future—that claim of his was backed up by Pentagon documents. And Prabowo said to me, “I was the Americans’ fair-haired boy.” He was Washington’s man in Jakarta for decades. But, after General Suharto, who had consolidated his power by massacring anywhere from a million—from 400,000 to a million civilians, with direct U.S. support, after Suharto was finally ousted in a democratic uprising in ’98, General Prabowo was no longer useful to Washington, and they just dumped him overnight, after he lost an internal power struggle with another general. Now Prabowo, who has been associated with at least two coup attempts, and who told me, when I spoke to him years ago, that Indonesia was not ready for democracy and that he thought—dreamed about seizing power and being called a fascist dictator, he now has a real chance to win the presidency.
And in the report I put out today, I refer to the minutes of a meeting which took place at one of Prabowo’s homes in Jakarta on December 21st of last year. This was a meeting with Prabowo, six other generals, several admirals and three of his civilian operatives, at least those that were named in the minutes, which leaked out through the aparat , the military police and intelligence system of Indonesia. According to that, they made specific plans for what they would do if Prabowo assumed power.
One of them was to stage opponents, and they specified the political parties that were anti-Prabowo that would be targeted. Second, though, was more novel, that they would also do mass arrests of allies of Prabowo. There seemed to be two motivations. One, to consolidate power in Prabowo’s own hands, to eliminate rivals, to eliminate other leaders, both in the opposition and in the camp that now supports him. To be targeted for arrest, according to these minutes, were the Demokrat party of former President General Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, and also the Islamist forces, ranging from the political party PKS to the FPI , the remnants of HTI , Islamist militia groups, and other kinds of mass organizations. These groups will also be targeted for arrest.
This, in accord with the second motivation, which was to curry favor with the United States. According to these minutes and to discussions I’ve had with people from the Prabowo circle in verifying this document and the material for this article, Prabowo is very eager to get back in the good graces of Washington, and so he’s actually seriously talking about arresting these Islamist groups that are now the driving force of his campaign. On the ground, they are the ones that are giving it energy, that are giving it organizational structure and, in my opinion, are giving him a real chance to win on Wednesday and defeat President Jokowi, the civilian incumbent. So, what they’re talking about is a political Night of the Long Knives, where both opponents and allies from outside Prabowo’s own party would be cast aside, eliminated, locked up.
In order to do this, they talked about deploying the attorney general of—Prabowo’s new attorney general, his new chief of the National Police, the ostensibly independent Corruption Eradication Commission, and also BIN , the national intelligence agency, which has a—the state intelligence body, which has a liaison relationship with the CIA and which sometimes does assassinations and, in fact, is perhaps best known for its arsenic assassination in 2004 of the great human rights hero Munir, who was a friend of mine.
Also, in this meeting, according to the minutes and my discussions with people who are familiar with it, they also talked about restoring the Indonesian Army to the role it played during the new order Suharto dictatorship. This was the time of the mass slaughter and a time when the Army was the ultimate arbiter of politics, even down to the neighborhood and village level. So, if General Prabowo wins this election—and he has a real chance—the consequences would be very severe for the chance of any future organizing, activism or movement toward anything resembling a real democracy in Indonesia.
And there’s a great irony here, because if this does turn out to be a close election, as I believe it will, there’s a chance that it’s the very victims of General Prabowo and their families, their descendants, the descendants of their families, and those who admire the brave struggle of many of these victims—they could be the ones who end up giving Prabowo the victory, because President Jokowi, who defeated Prabowo the last time around, in 2014, has disappointed the activist community. He said he would bring many of these generals, mass-murdering generals, to trial. He didn’t. He’s clearly afraid of the Army. He has brought some of these generals, like Hendropriyono and Wiranto, into his circle, to, according to his theory, protect him from the rest of the Army, which he doesn’t really have control over. And so, in their disappointment, many activists are talking about golput , essentially abstaining from voting. And there are indications that this golput vote, or nonvote, could be rather significant. And if it’s close, it could put Prabowo over the top.
AMY GOODMAN : Allan—
ALLAN NAIRN : There is some—
AMY GOODMAN : Allan, if you could, in the last minute, talk about the role of Freeport-McMoRan, one of the largest gold and copper mining operations in the world, based here in the United States?
ALLAN NAIRN : Yes. They operate in West Papua, which is de facto occupied by the security forces of Indonesia. They’ve stripped the mountains, spoiled the streams, done billions of dollars in environmental damage. Prabowo, General Prabowo, in his campaign, rails against foreigners, rails against foreign corporations and the extraction of Indonesia’s wealth. But, in fact, privately, Prabowo intervened to help Freeport-McMoRan, according to the vice chairman of his own political party, who told me how Prabowo intervened to kill a workers’ rights lawsuit against Freeport. And in terms of the election, I would say, ” Nurut saya: Jangan golput , use the vote.” This election could prove to be a turning point for Indonesia.
AMY GOODMAN : Allan Nairn, I want to thank you for being with us, activist, award-winning investigative journalist. To see his coverage of Indonesia, go to democracynow.org. Speaking to us form Jakarta, Indonesia, ahead of Indonesia’s Wednesday elections. Indonesia, the largest Muslim population in the world. Allan has been reporting from there for decades. Up Next"
"Bill McKibben: Green New Deal Is a Chance to ""Remake Not Just a Broken Planet, But a Broken Society""",www.democracynow.org,mail@democracynow.org (Democracy Now!),04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.democracynow.org/2019/4/15/bill_mckibben_green_new_deal_is,"Transcript This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.
AMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! I’m Amy Goodman. President Trump signed two executive orders last week to facilitate the approval of pipeline projects at a federal level, limiting states’ ability to regulate such projects. The move is intended in part to clear the way for permitting on the northeastern Constitution pipeline, which has stalled after New York invoked the Clean Water Act to reject the project on environmental grounds. This is President Trump speaking Wednesday in Crosby, Texas, where he signed the orders.
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP : My first order will speed up the process for approving vital infrastructure on our nation’s borders, such as oil pipelines, roads and railways. It will now take no more than 60 days. That’s a vast improvement. And the president, not the bureaucracy, will have sole authority to make the final decision when we get caught up in problems.
AMY GOODMAN : In response, last week we spoke to Dallas Goldtooth, organizer with the Indigenous Environmental Network. I asked him to explain the pipeline executive order signed by President Trump.
DALLAS GOLDTOOTH : You know, what we’re seeing right now with these executive orders is nothing but an act of aggression against the authority for states to protect their homelands or protect the residents of their state and the lands within the borders of those states, mainly targeting the Clean Water Act. Really, what Trump wants to do is take away the states’ abilities to enforce environmental regulations against pipeline projects or other infrastructure, fossil fuel projects, and take and give that power solely to the federal government. You know, this is—it’s kind of absurd that, you know, Trump, being a representative or the figurehead of the Republican Party, is wholeheartedly endorsing an ideology that the federal government has a final say over what happens within the borders of a state and that the state has very little recourse to address these issues. The other—there are just two executive orders, so that was the first one.
The second one really specifically talked—focuses on the cross-border—the border crossing of pipelines. In this regard, we’re talking about Keystone XL. I know Enbridge, Enbridge Line 3, was also one of those pipelines that had to deal with crossing the border from Canada to transport tar sands oil. And really what the president is trying to do, and he did this a couple weeks ago by approving Keystone XL a second time, is saying that he, as the president, has the sole power to approve these projects, and is encouraging the State Department to say—to act only as advisers to the president to sign these projects.
And there’s something really—something really insidious and dangerous about this, that is just a part, a continuing part, of Trump’s legacy for overreaching his executive powers, is that the president has stated that because he is the president, he is not a federal agency, therefore he’s not beholden to any environmental regulations that federal agencies have to follow, in particular the National Environmental Protection Act, parts of the Clean Water Act. You know, he’s saying that, “As the president, I actually am—I don’t have to follow those, because I’m not a federal agency.” And that’s very, very dangerous precedent to start here, especially as we look towards a rapid expansion of fossil fuel development in this country at this current moment and what we’re trying to fight against in the protection of Mother Earth and the sacredness of the land itself.
AMY GOODMAN : That’s Dallas Goldtooth, Diné and Dakota organizer with the Indigenous Environmental Network. You can visit our website to see the full interview with Dallas. Still with us, Bill McKibben, co-founder of 350.org , the global climate organization, his new book, Falter: Has the Human Game Begun to Play Itself Out? So, there you have Trump in Crosby, Texas, and you have one of the leading indigenous activists responding. But talk about your response last week, Wednesday.
BILL McKIBBEN: Well, first of all, it was great to see Dallas, who’s one of the savviest organizers in the whole world and has done an immense amount. And I feel much the same. I mean, what Trump’s trying to do is short-circuit this really effective protest movement that’s been built up around pipelines. In fact, Trump had another—I mean, I’ve got to say I took it almost a little personally, these executive orders, because, see, part of one of them also took aim at the divestment campaign, the fossil fuel divestment campaign.
AMY GOODMAN : And explain that that has—where that is now.
BILL McKIBBEN: We started, the year after some of us started this Keystone resistance, and which turned into a big resistance against pipelines and other fossil fuel infrastructure, in general, following the lead of indigenous people up in Alberta. The next year, a bunch of us—Naomi Klein and I and others—started this fossil fuel divestment campaign to get institutions to sell their stock. Well, it worked better than we thought it would. It’s become, by some measures, the largest anti-corporate campaign of its kind ever. I think we’re now at $8 trillion worth of endowments and portfolios that have divested in part or in whole.
And it’s really beginning to take a toll on the industry. Earlier this year, Shell said in its annual report that divestment had become a material risk to its business. A couple of weeks ago, the heads of many of the biggest coal firms in the world were at a Houston energy conference, and they were quoted by Politico as explaining that they just could not find capital anymore for new coal projects. Too many funds had divested. People had been scared off.
That’s why Trump’s trying to push back on that and on pipelines. I think, in so doing, he’s done us, in a sense, a favor. I mean, it’s pretty much like he’s providing the blueprints to the climate death star, you know, and saying, “Here are the couple of places you might want to push really hard, because it clearly hurts.”
AMY GOODMAN : Well, tell me if you think this will add to that movement: President Trump coming under fire earlier this month for falsely claiming windmills cause cancer. He made the remarks in a speech to the National Republican Congressional Committee, where he touted U.S. oil and gas drilling while mocking renewable energy.
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP : If you have a windmill anywhere near your house, congratulations. Your house just went down 75% in value. And they say the noise causes cancer. You told me that one, OK? Whirr! Whirr!
AMY GOODMAN : Iowa Republican Senator Chuck Grassley called Trump’s remark “idiotic,” saying, quote, “I wish his staff would tell him I’m the father and now the grandfather of wind energy tax credits.”
BILL McKIBBEN: Look, Trump is obviously a ludicrous buffoon in almost every situation, but never more so than here. His dislike of windmills dates to his desire for a Scottish golf course where no golfer would have to see one in the distance. But what he’s—the reason that Grassley is standing up for this is because places like Iowa now make a ton of money off the wind. It’s not like anyone is going to defeat these technologies. Wind and sun are free. That’s why they’re coming so fast.
What the fossil fuel industry, with Trump as one of its helpers, wants to do is slow that transition down, stretch it out, so that their current business model can last a couple more decades. The problem with that is that if we don’t get action really soon, if we let it stretch out, those are the decades that will finish the work of breaking the planet. It’s why the urgency of something like the Green New Deal is so crucial.
AMY GOODMAN : On Sunday, the Seychelles President Danny Faure visited a British-led science expedition exploring the depths of the Indian Ocean. From there, he gave an impassioned speech on climate change inside a manned underwater submersible, 400 feet below the ocean’s surface.
PRESIDENT DANNY FAURE : The ocean is huge, covering almost 70% of our planet, but we have managed to seriously impact this vast environment through climate change, ocean acidification, overfishing, plastic and other pollution and other threats. From this depth, I can see the incredible wildlife that needs our protection, and the consequences of damaging this huge ecosystem that has existed for millennia. … We must act accordingly. This issue is bigger than all of us. And we cannot wait for the next generation to solve it. We are running out of excuses to not take action, and running out of time.
AMY GOODMAN : That’s Seychelles President Danny Faure, again, speaking 400 feet below the Indian Ocean’s surface. Bill?
BILL McKIBBEN: It reminds me so much of watching Mohamed Nasheed from the Maldives take his whole Cabinet down in scuba gear for a Cabinet meeting to send the U.N., a decade ago, a message that we had to get back to 350 parts per million. It is now, at this point, the leadership of those most vulnerable states, the low-lying island states, places like Bangladesh, they are—I mean, the hair on fire is much too subtle an understatement. They understand that the absolute survival of the places where they live and the oceans around them is now at stake. You’d say they were the canaries in the coal mine, if it wasn’t such a horrible metaphor, at this point. They’re on the cutting edge. And remember that it’s their citizens who are really on the forefront of this movement everywhere. I dedicate this new book to our colleague Koreti Tiumalu in Fiji, who was one of the greatest activists we ever met, in the Pacific Climate Warriors.
AMY GOODMAN : Going from them and from the Seychelles president to 16-year-old Greta Thunberg, the Swedish climate activist who has inspired this global student strike. She was speaking just a few weeks ago for a call for more action on climate. This is Greta recently addressing a rally in Berlin.
GRETA THUNBERG : The older generations have failed tackling the biggest crisis humanity has ever faced. When we say to them that we are worried about the future of our civilization, they just pat on our heads, saying, “Everything will be fine. Don’t worry.” But we should worry. We should panic. And by panic, I don’t mean running around screaming. By panic, I mean stepping out of our comfort zones.
AMY GOODMAN : So, that’s Greta Thunberg. She was speaking in Berlin. When she first did her vigil alone for three weeks in front of the Swedish parliament, and MPs were saying to her, “Go to school,” she said, “We have done our homework, and that’s why I’m here.”
BILL McKIBBEN: She’s an amazing force. I mean, her basic point is, if governments can’t be bothered to prepare the world for climate change, it’s a little rich to demand that I sit in school all day preparing myself for the future. And it’s a message that’s amplified and resonated. There were millions of schoolchildren out on March 15th.
And now it’s time for adults to heed the call. Those kids were saying, in one rally after another, “We need adults backing us up.” Watch, over the next few months, as people try to organize the adult equivalent of those strikes, getting people out of their businesses for a day at a time, because if you think about it, I mean, they’re disrupting education as usual. We need to disrupt business as usual, because it’s business as usual, literally, that’s doing us in. It’s the fact that we just keep doing, going on doing what we’re doing, not changing in any dramatic way, at a moment when the world demands transformation.
AMY GOODMAN : People are more active than they’ve ever been on climate change. Talk about the change in understanding across the political spectrum in this country. This country’s so important because it’s historically the greatest greenhouse gas emitter. But also, you say, look at people, and look at me here with my computer in my hand, an extension of the human body.
BILL McKIBBEN: Look, we’re in a climate moment now. OK? That’s good news, something. The IPCC report last fall that gave us 10 years to make a change, the fires in California, the rise of the Green New Deal, somehow these things have finally captured people’s attention. So, as we enter, say, this presidential cycle, as you know, we used to fret and complain because they never had asked a question at any presidential debate about climate change. Well, I’m not worried about that, going forward. That’s going to be one of, if not the biggest question. Candidate after candidate, as they announce for president, are saying this is the most important issue that we face. Buttigieg said it yesterday in South Bend. That’s really important.
The question now is: Can we commit people to moving quickly enough? This is one of these places where I have to kind of restrain myself from saying, “Oh, if only you had listened to me when,” because—
AMY GOODMAN : Thirty years ago.
BILL McKIBBEN: —30 years ago, there were—30 years ago, there were things we could do that weren’t very hard. If we had made some fairly small adjustments, put a price on carbon, say, or something, we’d be on a very different trajectory now. Having let the fossil fuel industry delay action for three decades, we’re now at the point where everything is hard. And it’s going to be, for even the bravest politicians, a real stretch.
AMY GOODMAN : And you talk about this being a climate moment. It’s an everything moment for 2020. And you see this in the Democrats, for example, close to 20 now who are running for president.
BILL McKIBBEN: Yeah.
AMY GOODMAN : You have Jay Inslee of Washington state, the governor, running, saying climate change is his only issue.
BILL McKIBBEN: Only issue. What’s interesting this time is—and, you know, the way that we’re thinking about it at 350 Action and, I think, a lot of environmentalists are thinking about it, is, we actually need all 20 of them to be climate candidates. What we’re playing for now is less a set of policies, though the Green New Deal is the set of policies that we’re going to need, but what we’re playing for most of all is a change in the zeitgeist, a sense of what’s natural and obvious and normal, going forward. And if we can get that change, then the legislation will follow rather easily. The point is getting that across, taking us from the place where we weren’t paying attention to climate to the place where we’re understanding that it is the issue of our time.
AMY GOODMAN : Now, when we talk about it as the issue, it’s part and parcel with the inequality in this country, the power of these economic giants. You have, for example, oh, Chase, Seattle activists recently rallying against Chase Bank’s alleged—of their investments in fossil fuels.
BILL McKIBBEN: They shut down 44 branches last week.
AMY GOODMAN : Talk about—and then talk about JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, their response to all of this.
BILL McKIBBEN: So, the financial community, we really need them to step up. Most of them have issued reports announcing that they care about climate change, but they keep the money spigot open for the fossil fuel industry. That’s why people are able to build pipelines, because people keep lending them money. And so, increasingly, there’s pressure on the banking sector.
And the other place where you’re going to see more and more of it is pressure on the insurance sector. They have more money than anybody. And they should know better. They’re the ones with the actuarial tables demonstrating just what hot water we’re in, and yet they continue to lend money to the fossil fuel industry, too. The pressure on these guys to stop and change their ways is only going to grow more intense.
Look, this whole complex of the fossil fuel industry and the financiers who back them, they’re the Philip Morris of today. The only difference is, you know, where Philip Morris took us out one smoker at a time, Exxon is figuring out how to take us out one planet at a time. And that’s why the resistance is growing more vocal, angrier.
AMY GOODMAN : And finally, the Green New Deal, this paradigm-shattering approach that McConnell tried to humiliate the whole idea of by taking a vote at this moment, when even those who supported it didn’t want this to happen. The power of this new Congress, people like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and what the Green New Deal means to you?
BILL McKIBBEN: Well, partly, it’s great personal appreciation, because the kids who are doing it, this Sunrise Movement, which is a wonderful outfit, an awful lot of them, maybe most of them, cut their teeth on college campuses as part of this divestment movement. And it’s a reminder of how movements grow. But now they’ve introduced this legislation that is the first time we’ve had an answer to climate change that’s on the same scale as the problem itself. That’s why it’s important. It gets the scale right, and it understands that at this point we have to address it alongside inequality, alongside the economic insecurity that people suffer from, that this is an enormous crisis, but also an opportunity to remake not just a broken planet, but a broken society.
AMY GOODMAN : Bill McKibben, co-founder of 350.org , his new book, Falter: Has the Human Game Begun to Play Itself Out?

Copy may not be in its final form.
AMY GOODMAN : Thousands are taking to the streets in London today to demand radical action to combat the climate crisis. Protesters with the group Extinction Rebellion have set up encampments and roadblocks across Central London and say they’ll stay in the streets for at least a week. It’s just the beginning of a series of global actions that will unfold in the coming days, as activists around the world raise the alarm about government inaction in the face of the growing climate catastrophe. A spokesperson with Extinction Rebellion told The Guardian , “Governments prioritize the short-term interests of the economic elites, so to get their attention, we have to disrupt the economy,” they said.
The London protests come just days after schoolchildren around the globe left school again on Friday for the weekly “strike for climate.” The movement was started last year when, at the time, 15-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg stood alone outside the Swedish parliament to demand her government do more to combat climate change. Now kids around the globe have answered her call with their own weekly strikes. The esteemed journal Science published an open letter from scientists supporting the global youth protests last week. It reads in part, quote, “As scientists and scholars who have recently initiated similar letters of support in our countries, we call for our colleagues across all disciplines and from the entire world to support these young climate protesters. We declare: Their concerns are justified and supported by the best available science. The current measures for protecting the climate and biosphere are deeply inadequate,” Science wrote.
This all comes as the push for the Green New Deal continues to build momentum in the United States. The deal, backed by Congressmember Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Ed Markey, seeks to transform the U.S. economy through funding renewable energy while ending U.S. carbon dioxide emissions by 2030. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted last week, “The far-right loves to drum up fear & resistance to immigrants. But have you ever noticed they never talk about what’s causing people to flee their homes in the first place? Perhaps that’s bc they’d be forced to confront 1 major factor fueling global migration: Climate change,” she wrote.
We turn now to a climate activist and journalist who’s been on the front lines of the fight for the planet for decades. Thirty years ago, in 1989, Bill McKibben wrote The End of Nature , the first book about climate change for a general audience. He has just published a new book; it’s titled Falter: Has the Human Game Begun to Play Itself Out? Bill McKibben joins us here in our New York studio.
Welcome back to Democracy Now! It’s great to have you with us, Bill.
BILL McKIBBEN: Amy, it’s always good to be with you.
AMY GOODMAN : Falter: Has the Human Game Begun to Play Itself Out?
BILL McKIBBEN: You know, 30 years ago, when I started writing about this, it was a distant threat. We were issuing a warning. Scientists knew that as we burned coal and gas and oil, we were putting carbon in the atmosphere. They knew the molecular structure of CO2-trapped heat. We didn’t know how fast and how hard it was going to pinch. The story of the last 30 years—or one of the stories of the last 30 years—is that it pinched a hell of a lot harder and faster than even we had feared. The things we’re seeing now—half the sea ice in the summer Arctic gone, the ocean 30% more acidic, half the coral reefs under siege—these were things we thought would happen 50, 60, 70 years from now. But the planet turned out to be very finely balanced. So that was one of the surprises of those 30 years.
The other surprise was how little reaction there was in our political system, how slowly it’s moved. In essence, we’ve done almost nothing as a world to grapple with the biggest problem that we’ve ever wandered into.
The one piece of—well, the two pieces of really good news are, one, that the engineers have done their job just about as well as the politicians have done theirs badly. The price of a solar panel has dropped 90%. We have the technology, in a way that we didn’t even a decade ago, to know where we could turn if we wanted to. And we’ve seen this rise of remarkable movements over the last decade. You know, there were periods of time when I felt like—have you ever had one of those nightmares where you’re trying to communicate to everybody that something bad is going on, but words won’t come out of your mouth, or they can’t hear you or something? There was a period when I felt like that. I no longer feel lonely like that anymore. There are a lot—millions of people around the world engaged in this fight. We’ll see if that’s enough power to overcome the wealth and influence of the fossil fuel industry in time or not.
AMY GOODMAN : So, talk about how you’ve divided your book into these four sections—
BILL McKIBBEN: Sure.
AMY GOODMAN : —the size of the board, leverage, the name of the game and an outside chance.
BILL McKIBBEN: The question that haunts me, and has since I wrote The End of Nature , is whether we’ve—the thing that we’re doing now is so large that it fundamentally alters our prospects as a civilization. Climate change is the best example of that. And climate change, by now, has already reached the point where, as I say in the first section, it changes the size of the board on which we’re playing this game. Forever, since humans came out of Africa, we’ve been expanding the board on which we play the game, you know, finding new places, spreading out. Now things are contracting. Now people are beginning to worry very much about the cities that they live that are near the coasts. Now we’re seeing—perhaps you saw the story in yesterday’s Times about how climate change has become the main driver for those immigrants having to leave their homes in Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, not because they want to, because there’s such a deep drought that they can’t grow anything there anymore. Those are the opening salvos in what’s going to be a century of shrinkage.
I mean, think about what we saw in California last fall. I mean, literally, in an hour, a city called Paradise turned literally into hell. You know, everybody who watched it could imagine dying in a car trapped in a road as they tried to get out of a forest fire. If California, the place we’ve always identified with a kind of golden ease, you know, is now in a paranoid sense of fear for much of the year as they look over their shoulder for the next fire, well, that’s another sense in which this board has begun to shrink.
The second part of the book is more political. I tried to answer, for my own purposes, the question of why we did so little for so long. And I think it has everything to do with the ascendant political ideology of this period, this sense that laissez-faire capitalism, that markets alone would solve problems, that happened to be the dominant political philosophy in the most important country in the world at precisely the most important moment. It’s no accident that people like the Koch brothers, our biggest political players, are also oil and gas barons. I mean, they understood climate change as a threat both to their business and to their ideological worldview, because, of course, if we’re going to solve it, we’re going to have to take joint action, as societies, to do so.
The third part of the book takes a turn into Silicon Valley and asks the question, if, having ended nature, we’re also on the verge of ending human nature. The same libertarian ideology, the same Ayn Rand fan club, that exists in places like the Koch brothers’ network, exists, too, at the top of the heap in Silicon Valley, where everybody pays homage to the idea that they should be left alone by the government—left alone in this case to do things like genetically engineer children, so that we had, in October, the first two designer babies born on this planet, in China, but, as we learned in yesterday’s newspaper, with help from professors at places like Stanford. That future should frighten us in all kinds of ways, that future of ever larger AI, of ever more—
AMY GOODMAN : Artificial intelligence.
BILL McKIBBEN: Intelligence. Perhaps you saw the story in today’s papers about how the Chinese have weaponized AI, and they can now identify in any crowd, in any place in China, anyone who has the facial features of a Uyghur Muslim, and be able to track them by camera automatically. I mean, we’re talking about tens of millions of people in a country of billions of people. It’s something out of a science fiction story, except it isn’t. The science fiction stories—
AMY GOODMAN : The minority Uyghur—
BILL McKIBBEN: —are coming true.
AMY GOODMAN : The minority Uyghur Muslim population in China.
BILL McKIBBEN: Exactly right.
So, the fourth part of the book asks: Is it too late to do anything about this? If we wanted to, what could we do? And here I allow myself a little more hope. I’ve had the privilege over the last decade, since we started 350.org , of watching this climate movement arise. And it’s been a great joy to see that happen and to see it join with other movements for justice, against inequality, in a kind of progressive coalition.
I think there were two great inventions of the 20th century that might just save us in the 21st. The first was the solar panel. It’s magic on a kind of Hogwarts scale, Amy. I mean, you point a sheet of glass at the sun, and out the back flows light and communications and modernity. To get to see it being installed for the first time in remote parts of Africa, say—I did a long story for The New Yorker a couple years ago on this—was a fantastic joy. I mean, to watch people who had never had a cold drink in their life, suddenly, because of these solar panels, able to do so, reminds us of how much we take for granted.
The other invention of the 20th century that holds out real hope is this invention of nonviolent social movements, from the suffragettes, from Gandhi, from Dr. King, from people learning how to take—well, how to take the power of the many and the small to stand up to the mighty and the few. Climate change is perhaps the most dramatic example of this there’ll ever be. I mean, as you know, we learned a lot in the last few years about the nature of the fossil fuel industry, about the fact that they knew everything there was to know about climate change back in the 1980s, knew everything and believed it. Exxon began building all its drilling rigs to compensate for the rise in sea level they knew was coming. They just didn’t tell the rest of us. Instead, they devoted billions of dollars to building this architecture of deceit and denial and disinformation that’s kept us locked for 30 years in an utterly sterile debate about whether or not global warming was real, a debate that both sides knew the answer to from the start. It’s just one of them was willing to lie.
And so, now we’re at the point where we have no choice but to hope we can build movements big enough, loud enough, beautiful enough to challenge that power. That’s why, for me, it’s incredibly moving and incredibly exciting to see the young people doing the Green New Deal work, to see Greta Thunberg and her comrades, you know, 12-year-olds, out of school and talking articulately about these questions. I don’t know if we’re going to win, but we definitely are going to have a fight.
AMY GOODMAN : Well, we have a lot to talk about in the next segment.

The International Criminal Court announced Friday it was refusing to pursue an investigation into possible war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by the United States and other actors in Afghanistan. The court suggested the U.S.'s lack of cooperation with the investigation was behind the decision. Earlier this month, the U.S. revoked the visa of ICC prosecutor Fatou Bensouda, who asked ICC judges to authorize the investigation in 2017. Human rights groups condemned the decision. Katherine Gallagher of the Center for Constitutional Rights said the ICC was “bowing to President Trump's pressure campaign” and that “With its decision, the International Criminal Court sends a dangerous message: that bullying wins and that the powerful won’t be held to account.” Topics: Sudan: Military Leadership Challenged by Ongoing Protests Apr 15, 2019
In Sudan, the head of the newly installed military council resigned Friday, just one day after he was sworn in following the ouster of longtime President Omar al-Bashir. The ouster came after months of public protests demanding al-Bashir’s resignation. The military’s chief of staff also stepped down from his post Friday. Protesters celebrated the news and mounted calls for the creation of a civilian transitional council, rejecting the military’s proposal to lead a two-year pre-election transition period.
Meanwhile, the United Nations has called on Sudanese authorities to release anyone arrested for demonstrating against the government. It also called on Sudan to cooperate with the International Criminal Court , which issued an arrest warrant in 2005 for ousted leader al-Bashir over possible war crimes. Sudan’s military council said they would not hand over al-Bashir to the ICC but instead would put him on trial in Sudan. Local reports emerged Monday that other top officials from al-Bashir’s government were arrested by the military council and could also face prosecution. Topics:"

Trump vs. Mother Earth: Indigenous Activist Dallas Goldtooth Slams Trump's Pipeline Executive Orders,www.democracynow.org,,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.democracynow.org/2019/4/15/trump_vs_mother_earth_indigenous_activist,"organizer with the Indigenous Environmental Network. Transcript This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.
AMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report . I’m Amy Goodman, with Nermeen Shaikh.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : President Trump signed two executive orders Wednesday to facilitate the approval of pipeline projects at a federal level, limiting states’ ability to regulate such projects. The move is intended in part to clear the way for permitting on the northeastern Constitution pipeline, which has stalled after New York invoked the Clean Water Act to reject the project on environmental grounds. This is Trump speaking on Wednesday from Crosby, Texas, where he signed the orders.
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP : My first order will speed up the process for approving vital infrastructure on our nation’s borders, such as oil pipelines, roads and railways. It will now take no more than 60 days. That’s a vast improvement. And the president, not the bureaucracy, will have sole authority to make the final decision when we get caught up in problems. We’ll do what’s right.
My second order will modernize regulations for LNG export terminals and encourage new infrastructure financing. It will improve access for workers and operators to maintain electrical lines. And finally, it will stop state-level abuse of water quality certifications—they abuse you; when you’re nowhere near water, they abuse you—from blocking the construction of vital pipeline projects, as we rebuild our energy infrastructure. And it will be like never before.
AMY GOODMAN : This comes as climate activists have filed a federal lawsuit challenging three South Dakota laws, including the so-called Riot Boosting Act they say targets activists who encourage or organize protests, particularly against the Keystone XL pipeline. The laws give the state the authority to sue any individual or group for encouraging a protest where acts of violence occur, whether or not the individual was involved in or had knowledge of the violent act. Organizers also can face criminal penalties of up to 25 years in prison. The ACLU , which filed the lawsuit, asserts the laws violate First Amendment rights.
Well, for more, we’re going to Dallas Goldtooth, organizer with Indigenous Environmental Network, also one of the plaintiffs in the ACLU lawsuit.
Welcome to Democracy Now! , Dallas. Thanks for joining us from Pittsburgh. Can you start off by talking about the executive orders that President Trump just signed?
DALLAS GOLDTOOTH : Yeah. Thank you very much, Amy, for having me on and covering this important topic.
You know, what we’re seeing right now with these executive orders is nothing but an act of aggression against the authority for states to protect their homelands or protect the residents of their state and the lands within the borders of those states, mainly targeting the Clean Water Act. Really, what Trump wants to do is take away the states’ abilities to enforce environmental regulations against pipeline projects or other infrastructure, fossil fuel projects, and take and give that power solely to the federal government. You know, this is—it’s kind of absurd that, you know, Trump, being a representative or the figurehead of the Republican Party, is wholeheartedly endorsing an ideology that the federal government has a final say over what happens within the borders of a state and that the state has very little recourse to address these issues. The other—there are just two executive orders, so that was the first one.
The second one really specifically talked—focuses on the cross-border—the border crossing of pipelines. In this regard, we’re talking about Keystone XL. I know Enbridge, Enbridge Line 3, was also one of those pipelines that had to deal with crossing the border from Canada to transport tar sands oil. And really what the president is trying to do, and he did this a couple weeks ago by approving Keystone XL a second time, is saying that he, as the president, has the sole power to approve these projects, and is encouraging the State Department to say—to act only as advisers to the president to sign these projects.
And there’s something really—something really insidious and dangerous about this, that is just a part, a continuing part, of Trump’s legacy for overreaching his executive powers, is that the president has stated that because he is the president, he is not a federal agency, therefore he’s not beholden to any environmental regulations that federal agencies have to follow, in particular the National Environmental Protection Act, parts of the Clean Water Act. You know, he’s saying that, “As the president, I actually am—I don’t have to follow those, because I’m not a federal agency.” And that’s very, very dangerous precedent to start here, especially as we look towards a rapid expansion of fossil fuel development in this country at this current moment and what we’re trying to fight against in the protection of Mother Earth and the sacredness of the land itself.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : And, Dallas Goldtooth, could you talk about, in fact, some of the efforts that states have been making to resist, block these pipelines, in Pennsylvania, for example, and elsewhere?
DALLAS GOLDTOOTH : Yeah. Over the past decade, we’ve seen a lot of states become more aware about the dangers of fossil fuel infrastructure projects and the risks that they pose to drinking water and to clean air. I think, on the big picture, we’re seeing a greater understanding about how these projects lock us into more fossil fuel development, and therefore add to the climate chaos that we’re seeing with the increase of greenhouse gas emissions. And so you’re seeing some states, like Pennsylvania or even New York, who are taking steps to address that by putting moratoriums on fracking development or having a more stringent process or a more stringent evaluation of pipeline projects and their impacts, whether it’s very specific or cumulative impacts on climate overall. And one of those examples that the president has referenced specifically is how New York state has used the Clean Water Act to to halt the continuation of the Constitution pipeline in that area.
On the flip side, we’re also seeing states who are trying their very hardest to increase fossil fuel development in their areas. And one way that they’re doing that is to suppress the ability for common, everyday citizens to publicly protest against them or to use their First Amendment rights to speak out against these projects’ impacts on their communities.
AMY GOODMAN : Last month, the Rainforest Action Network, along with a coalition of environmental groups, including your group, the Indigenous Environmental Network, released its annual fossil fuel finance report card called “Banking on Climate Change.” The report showed that 33 of the world’s largest banks have financed $1.9 trillion into fossil fuels since the Paris Agreement was signed in 2016. Michigan Democratic Congressmember Rashida Tlaib referenced the report as she questioned CEOs from the nation’s largest banks Wednesday at a congressional hearing called “Holding Megabanks Accountable.”
REP . RASHIDA TLAIB : A report released two weeks ago shows that fossil fuel lending and underwriting is dominated by big U.S. banks, four of which are sitting right here in front of us. Chase, Wells Fargo, Citi, as well as Bank of America are top four banks in the world financing fossil fuel industry. Mr. Dimon, your bank alone has provided more than $195 billion in fossil fuel lending and underwriting over the past three years, since signing of the Paris climate agreement, making your bank the number one funder of fossil fuels in the world. Citi, Mr Corbat, has provided more than $129 billion in fossil fuel funding over the past three years, number three in the world. Mr Moynihan, Bank of America has provided more than $106 billion in fossil fuel funding over the past three years, making it number four in the world.
I want folks—don’t say that you’re committed to clean and sustainable financing, because your companies’ words are not consistent with your actions. I would call this gaslighting. That’s kind of what we call it in the neighborhood. But for the sake of this hearing, I’ll say that you are greenwashing your own track record in duping the American people into believing that you are helping address climate change. On the record, will any of your banks make a commitment to phase out your investments in fossil fuels and dirty energy and align your investments with the goals of Paris climate agreement, to help protect our planet and communities I grew up in? That goes to all of you, if you guys can answer that. Mr Corbat?
MICHAEL CORBAT : We have—we are in the business of supporting fossil fuel companies, many of which are U.S.-based companies.
AMY GOODMAN : That’s Michael L. Corbat, CEO of Citigroup, responding to that question from Michigan Congressmember Rashida Tlaib. Dallas Goldtooth, overall, your response to what she is raising?
DALLAS GOLDTOOTH : You could hear a penny drop in that room when she asked that question. You know, she raised a great point, based on the report that I, again, was a part of. That was the fossil fuel financial report that was put out. You know, at the top of the list—I mean, what that report does is it lists the top banks who are financing fossil fuel production—or, fossil fuel expansion across the globe. And JPMorgan Chase is at the very top of that. Wells Fargo comes in a close second. The top leading banks in the United States are all heavily invested in fossil fuels. And that’s why we are leading a major divestment campaign, to make sure that we are holding these banks accountable, because really, you know, if they’re financing the expansion of these projects and if these projects are making the planet worse off and creating more climate chaos, as well as if these projects are causing human rights violations or indigenous rights violations, as which we saw in Standing Rock with the Dakota Access pipeline or we’re seeing in other places in South America or in Africa, then the banks should be held accountable, because they’re giving money to these corporations to do this. And that’s the whole idea behind it.
Another fact that was brought—some more statistics that were brought up in that hearing relates to a report that was put out by Oil Change International. It says that if nothing—if there’s no change that happens right now over the next 30 years, the U.S. drilling is going to extract over 120 billion tons of carbon, which will have the equivalency of a thousand coal-fired power plants. The United States is leading the charge in creating the climate chaos that we’re seeing across this planet. So we have to hold our institutions, whether it’s the public offices and those that are in those positions or whether it’s the financial institutions, accountable for their contributions to the problem.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : Dallas Goldtooth, very quickly, before we conclude, could you talk about the lawsuit that you’re involved with, with a number of—
DALLAS GOLDTOOTH : Yes.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : —different organizations? Explain “riot boosting” laws and what the—what you’re suing about.
DALLAS GOLDTOOTH : Yes. In South Dakota, there is a law that just passed that makes it illegal for people to riot boost. One of the main issues is that there’s no clear definition of what riot boosting is. Effectively, what it means is if a pipeline—if Keystone XL starts being constructed in South Dakota, it’s illegal for me, as somebody that lives outside of South Dakota, to go on Facebook and say, “Hey, there’s a public protest happening on Saturday in Pierre, South Dakota, in your capital. People should go to it.” And should there be a fight that breaks out or something that happens that is determined—as determined as a “riot,” I could be held accountable, and I could actually be sued and fined and actually be charged with a felony, for just suggesting for people to use their First Amendment rights to speak out against this project. And South Dakota just passed this bill. We’re filing this lawsuit against it, on the grounds of a violation of our First Amendment rights. But we’re also seeing similar bills being talked about in other states. In Texas, right now there’s a discussion about a very similar bill, that makes it illegal for people to hold—to protest in public or to encourage people to go out and protest in public, to use our First Amendment rights to advocate for a better world, a better society.
And I think, overall, all this discussion, these laws, this executive order by Trump, the continued financing of fossil fuel projects by the largest banks in the world, from an indigenous perspective, these are direct acts of aggression against the sovereign authority for tribal nations to protect their homelands and their territories from further violation and destruction. And tribal nations are leading the charge to build a better world. And, you know, we’re not used to these acts of aggression. I mean, in my personal opinion, when it comes to Trump and all these other cronies that are part of the fossil fuel regime, we’re dealing with nothing short of the ideological descendants of Custer, whose hubris and shortsightedness is leading us closer and closer to the brink of climate chaos and destruction. And it’s up to Native folks—or, it’s not up to us as Native folks, but we happen to be leading the charge to push back against that. And, you know, we’re going to continue to do that as much as possible. We’re not afraid to use our voice. We’re not afraid to push back. And that’s one of the reasons why the Indigenous Environmental Network is a part of these lawsuits.

In Sudan, the head of the newly installed military council resigned Friday, just one day after he was sworn in following the ouster of longtime President Omar al-Bashir. The ouster came after months of public protests demanding al-Bashir’s resignation. The military’s chief of staff also stepped down from his post Friday. Protesters celebrated the news and mounted calls for the creation of a civilian transitional council, rejecting the military’s proposal to lead a two-year pre-election transition period.
Meanwhile, the United Nations has called on Sudanese authorities to release anyone arrested for demonstrating against the government. It also called on Sudan to cooperate with the International Criminal Court , which issued an arrest warrant in 2005 for ousted leader al-Bashir over possible war crimes. Sudan’s military council said they would not hand over al-Bashir to the ICC but instead would put him on trial in Sudan. Local reports emerged Monday that other top officials from al-Bashir’s government were arrested by the military council and could also face prosecution. Topics: "

France is reeling after a massive fire tore through Paris’s beloved Notre-Dame cathedral, built 800 years ago and a celebrated landmark around the world. Parisians looked on in shock Monday as around 400 firefighters attempted to get the blaze under control—some onlookers engaging in prayers and religious songs. The fire claimed the cathedral’s spire and ravaged parts of the interior, but the iconic twin medieval towers remain standing, as does the rest of the stone structure. Two of France’s wealthiest men have pledged over $330 million to the reconstruction effort. The European Union has also vowed to help rebuild the church. Authorities have launched an investigation into how the fire started, but ruled out arson, saying they believed it was started by accident, likely related to the ongoing $180 million renovation of the building. We speak with Anne Lester, associate professor of medieval history at Johns Hopkins University, about the role of Notre-Dame in French cultural and spiritual life, as well as its significance to the wider world.

JUAN GONZÁLEZ: France is in mourning today after a fire ripped through Paris’s beloved Notre-Dame cathedral, a medieval church in the heart of the city that was built more than 850 years ago. Thousands of Parisians watched in shock on Monday as the fire toppled the cathedral’s spire and continued to burn for hours. For centuries, Notre-Dame has been the center of Catholic life in France, and it is one of the most visited churches in the world. The fire occurred during the holiest week of the Christian year. Authorities are just beginning to assess how much was damaged inside the church. On Monday night, French President Emmanuel Macron spoke to reporters nearby.
PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON : [translated] The worst has been avoided, even though the battle has not yet been completely won. The next few hours will be difficult. But thanks to the courage of the firefighters, the facade and main towers have not collapsed. So, tonight, above all, my thoughts go out to the Catholics, Catholics in France and all over the world, especially during this Holy Week. I know how they feel, and we are with them. … My thoughts also go out to all the people of Paris. Notre-Dame of Paris is their cathedral and more. The mayor of Paris was with us all these hours, from the first flames, and I know how she and all the residents of the city are feeling. I also want to spare a thought for all our compatriots, because the Notre-Dame of Paris is our history, our literature, our imagination, a place where we have lived all our great moments, our epidemics, our wars, our liberation. It is the epicenter of our lives. It is the benchmark from which distances start and from which we measure ourselves from Paris. It appears in so many books, so many paintings. It is a cathedral that is the one of all French men and women, even those who have never come here.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: Mourners gathered throughout the night in Paris to pray and sing while watching the flames engulf the cathedral, a structure which can be seen throughout the city.
MOURNERS : [singing] Je vous salue, Marie, pleine de grâce. Le Seigneur est avec vous. Vous êtes bénie entre toutes les femmes…
AMY GOODMAN : While the fire destroyed the cathedral’s spire, Notre-Dame’s iconic twin medieval towers remain standing, as does the rest of the stone structure. French authorities have launched investigations into how the fire started and the structural stability of the building. The cathedral was undergoing a major restoration when the blaze began. Last year, the Catholic Church launched a major fundraising appeal to help preserve the cathedral. At the time, the church said, “Parts of the 850-year-old Gothic masterpiece are starting to crumble, because of pollution eating the stone, and there are fears the structure could become unstable,” they said.
French President Macron has vowed to rebuild Notre-Dame. Two of France’s wealthiest men have already pledged over $330 million. This comes as Macron’s government continues to push sweeping austerity measures. Guardian columnist Aditya Chakrabortty tweeted, “The Notre Dame exposes the paradoxes of austerity politics: Macron preaches cut for French people, yet swears a national effort to restore a cathedral Billionaires squeal at paying higher taxes, yet can throw millions at this We haven’t moved far from the rich buying indulgences,” he said. The European Union has also vowed to help rebuild Notre-Dame. Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, spoke earlier today in Brussels.
DONALD TUSK : The burning of the Notre-Dame cathedral has again made us aware that we are bound by something more important and more profound than treaties. Today we understand better the essence of that, which is common, we know how much we can lose. And that we want to defend it—together.
AMY GOODMAN : To talk more about the fire at the Notre-Dame cathedral and the church’s historical significance, we’re joined now by Anne Lester, associate professor of medieval history at Johns Hopkins University.
Professor Lester, welcome to Democracy Now! Describe your feelings as you watched the flame yesterday, the flames engulfing the spire of Notre-Dame, the ceiling collapsing, what they call the forest, because it almost took a forest of trees to build that ceiling. The significance of Notre-Dame cathedral?
ANNE LESTER : Yeah. I mean, I think, like everyone across the world watching this, it was shocking and devastating, really. I’ve spent my career working on Paris, on the medieval period, on Notre-Dame, and all the things that have been collected in the building there, and the life and cultural heritage of this building and what it embodies. I think we were all just shocked watching the spire burn and collapse into the center of the cathedral. And certainly, it made, I think, everyone think about the way that a monument like this functions in our modern world today. It really is a testament to a set of ideas, human ideas—in this case, about the divine. And as is true of all monuments, it has been here for hundreds of years before us, and we all assumed it would persist for hundreds of years to come. So, I think it was a very—it has been a very overwhelming, you know, nearly day and a half—a day, 24 hours, really.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: Well, Professor Lester, as someone who knows well all of the historical—the artifacts and the relics that are in the cathedral, what have you heard so far, what have you been able to glean, in terms of what was preserved and what may have been lost?
ANNE LESTER : Yeah. What we’ve learned from friends and colleagues in Paris is that it seems, very early on, there were efforts by the administrators of the cathedral, and of course in coordination with the firefighters, to save what they could, that people were going in and grabbing what they could and leaving the building as quickly as possible.
Distinct efforts were made to preserve two of the most important, most holy relics that were contained in the building, that would have been the center of veneration during Holy Week, first and foremost, of course, the crown of thorns, which is a reliquary dating back to the time of Jesus’s passion. The relic of the crown, it was believed that that was put on his head at the time of the passion to mark him and to mock him as the king of the Jews during the crucifixion. It was preserved, then moved over time to Constantinople and then, eventually, brought in the middle of the 13th century to Paris, where it resided, ever since 1237. So, the history of that relic, the history for the Catholic faith, for the culture of France and of Christianity, is profound. And it’s my understanding that that was saved, as well as a relic of the tunic of Saint Louis, the king of France in the 13th century, who dies in 1270—a very holy symbol of the kingdom of France and the French realm—and that those two and possibly other relics and portable objects from the trésor , or the treasury, were saved.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: What was likely lost, from what you have been able to tell so far?
ANNE LESTER : Yeah, it’s very hard to know. I haven’t—I mean, another relic of great significance was the relic of the True Cross, that was also kept there. I have yet to hear whether that was preserved.
Certainly, what’s very clear, even though the stonework of the building itself, as well as the vaulting on the interior, for the most part, seems to have been preserved, no doubt deeply scarred, there is going to be both damage from the fire, as well as from the water putting the fire out. Water is not good for limestone. Much like marble, it will melt if it is saturated with water and not able to dry quickly enough.
So, there are parts of the building that were preserved, but then we know much of the wood on the interior, carved wood, part of the choir that would have been carved in wood, that area where the canons would sit and sing the Mass—it’s unclear whether the carved statuary that encircled the high altar and that choir area, a relief sculpture carved beautifully in the later Middle Ages, painted in fine detail—something that leapt out to any visitor who walked around that part of the cathedral, because it really told, in an animated cycle of sculpture, the story of the life of Jesus, and it was an extremely compelling way to communicate these stories to people, people from the Middle Ages onward who didn’t read, who couldn’t read or who were listening and knew the stories orally—that seems not to survive.
And perhaps most devastating of all is the loss of the glass in the cathedral, because, of course, when a fire burns that hot, the lead that held the stained glass panels in place, particularly in that choir area and in the crossing, where the spire fell in the middle of the cathedral, that lead would melt, and the glass would either melt itself, because it got so hot, or certainly would be lost. Thankfully, the three—it seems that the three great rose windows on the west, north and south facades have remained in place.
AMY GOODMAN : Anne, if you can talk about, I mean, the history that the cathedral has lived through, if you will, I mean, from the French revolution, epidemics, the two World Wars?
ANNE LESTER : Yeah, absolutely. I mean, the cathedral, as we see it today, was begun in 1163, if we can imagine that, right?—you know, over 800 years ago—and persisted, was built over the course of more than a hundred years, through the 13th century. It changed in styles to express new ideas, new notions of devotion and what the divine was. It changed to accommodate more and more visitors who came to Paris as the city itself grew.
And, exactly, like a monument that is witness to so much that happens around it, Notre-Dame was there for people during the period of the plague in the 14th century that devastated cities like Paris. It was there during the period of the Hundred Years’ War, a backdrop to the story that played out for someone like Joan of Arc, another hero in French history. Likewise, the cathedral persisted through periods of religious war, which marred France. It was there as a symbol and was damaged, in turn, on the part of the Huguenots active in Paris. It, of course, persisted through the revolution, as well, and was a symbol to people in the revolution, particularly the carving of the kings, representations of the Old Testament kings that were also viewed as representations of the kings of France. They were damaged, the heads lopped off. But the people of Paris lovingly saved that sculpture, and some of it was able to be restored over time.
Notre-Dame also persisted through the two World Wars, which is remarkable, as other grand cathedrals in France did not—Chartres, for example, Soissons, Amiens, cathedrals that were damaged, particularly during either the First or Second World War in bombing campaigns. That was not the fate for Notre-Dame. The people of Notre-Dame actually took down the glass, preserved it, did what they could to preserve the stonework of the cathedral. In this case, with this fire, something so unexpected, that moved at such a fast pace, there was no way there was time to consider how or what could be preserved.
So the building itself really has witnessed scores of French history, witnessed the very making and remaking of a notion of France and of the French monarchy. It was a crucial building for Napoleon and his image and vision of what France could become in the 19th century, as well as the way that France restored itself after the Second World War. It became a symbol for people, of unity and of what it means to rebuild and remake French civilization.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Professor Lester, how do you—your reaction to the overwhelming public reaction, people coming forward now to donate, some of the richest people in France now promising hundreds of millions of dollars to restore the cathedral, especially coming as it did, this tragedy, right in between Palm Sunday and Good Friday and Easter, the holiest week in the Christian calendar?
ANNE LESTER : Yeah. I mean, I think the building clearly has resonance far beyond the borders of France. You know, it is a world monument. It is marked out that way. Tourists come from across the globe to visit Notre-Dame. And to have walked through the building, to have taken in the kind of vision of what the experience of the divine should be like, whether you’re Christian or not, have entered into that building, you would experience some of that. And I think the sentiment that we see coming out across the world, and certainly from Americans who have spent a great deal of time there, from people in Britain, from all over, who visited, this is a monument that has great cultural significance to all of us, in many ways, representing a whole host of ideas.
And to be sure, to Catholics, during Holy Week, the loss of this building is just almost unbelievable, hard to really fathom. I think it’s extremely difficult for us to conceive of the significance, as I say, of the relics that were kept within the treasury. The crown of thorns would have been processed during Holy Week. It would have been the focal point of devotion, as it had been for many years at Notre-Dame. And we’re very lucky that the relic itself was saved, but it is hard to imagine the relic having the same meaning, not being able to move through the space of the cathedral itself.
I think it’s not surprising that people are interested in donating to the restoration of Notre-Dame. I think that’s crucial. It is clearly a way to bring people together within France. France, like many countries across the globe, are just going to experience a set of really difficult decisions. Moves for general austerity come up against and really point out, again, the sort of paradox of the meaning of a cultural symbol like this, which will demand attention right away. And I hope that there can be ways to navigate this situation, to have people of means donate as they can, and to really take this as a moment where we can evaluate what it means for all of us to come together as a community and the ways in which cultural symbols, symbols produced for cultural unity, really can function in that way. I think the rebuilding campaign will be tremendously important.
AMY GOODMAN : Anne Lester, we want to thank you for being with us, associate professor of medieval history at Johns Hopkins University. The relics they saved, I understand, will then be on display now at the Louvre while they rebuild the Notre-Dame cathedral.

His new book is titled Falter: Has the Human Game Begun to Play Itself Out? Transcript This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.
AMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report . I’m Amy Goodman. Bill McKibben is out with a new book. Yes, the co-founder of the global climate organization 350.org . His new book is Falter: Has the Human Game Begun to Play Itself Out?
Well, Bill, you talk so much about climate change. Interestingly, in this book, you expand to talk about the threats of artificial intelligence, of genetic engineering. Why?
BILL McKIBBEN: Put it this way. You know, I’ve described climate change as a possibility of ending nature. These new technologies have the possibility of ending human nature, of taking us from what we’ve been, all through our evolutionary past, and replacing us, quite quickly, with something else. Some of those worries are practical: What does AI do to people’s livelihoods as, you know, we start automating everything that we do? Those practical problems are important, but there’s a deeper problem around sort of human meaning that really gets to me.
I talk a lot in the book about the advances in human genetic engineering, because, as you know, these are now no longer just some distant science fiction threat. The world produced its first two genetically engineered human beings in October, a pair of twins in China. The scientist who did that is now in trouble with his government and with scientific groups. And there seems to be some at least beginnings of a recognition that we’re on dangerous terrain here. But there hasn’t been—I mean, we’re sort of at the same place we were with climate change 30 years ago. There hasn’t been the debate that we need in society.
AMY GOODMAN : Talk about what just happened with genetic engineering of these—
BILL McKIBBEN: Sure. A doctor in China produced two twins who had been genetically engineered to make sure that they would never get HIV—something that, as every doctor pointed out, is an absurd use of this technology, because there’s lots and lots of ways to make sure you don’t get HIV once you’re born, OK?
But the thing that worries everyone is that as you start by making changes that seem benign like this, you very quickly move over into the world of improving children. Scientist after scientist, from James Watson, the kind of father of the double helix, on down, have made it clear that that’s their goal—improving intelligence, changing mood. We’re now to the point where those things are at least beginning to be within our grasp. We know how you regulate dopamine in the human brain and what genes turn it on and off. And it’s not beyond possibility to imagine trying to change the mood of a child. Once you start down that path, the thing that scares me most of all is that you take away human meaning.
There are two ways I think people can understand this. One is the fact that by making people into products, you also start the process of making those products obsolete. So let’s say, Amy, you go to the clinic to your first child, and you have a certain amount of money, and you’re able to spend it to upgrade your kid with the best stuff that there is. Then let’s say you go back five years later, maybe have a little more money, and definitely technology has progressed, because that’s what this kind of technology does. Now your $5,000 buys you twice the upgrades you had before, the sort of human equivalent of, you know, moon roof and leather seats. And what does that make your first child? Your first child’s now Windows 6, you know, iPhone 8, obsolete already. That’s new for human beings. We’ve always been connected to the past and connected to the future.
The other challenge, the other thing that just sort of makes me shiver, is to imagine what it means to grow up one of those children. Let’s say that your parents engineered you to have a certain mood, to be sunny and optimistic, say. Well, you reach adolescence, and you suddenly realize that you don’t know whether you’re sunny and optimistic today because something good has happened to you and that’s how you’re feeling or because that’s your spec, you know, that’s the thing that your body has been engineered to produce. Human meaning is as vulnerable as the physical planet we live on. And just like the physical planet, we overestimate its stability. We take it for granted, because it’s never been challenged before. But just as we’re now wrecking the planet around us, we’re also running the danger of wrecking the most intimate and essential things about who we are.
AMY GOODMAN : Artificial intelligence?
BILL McKIBBEN: Well, artificial intelligence—
AMY GOODMAN : And what exactly does it mean?
BILL McKIBBEN: Well, that’s, of course, one of the questions. And we don’t exactly know where the lines are, but we begin to sense that there’s a problem about making machines that are smarter than we are, much, much smarter. The scientists who talk about this envision that sometime in the next 10, 20, 30 years, computers, that have already shown they can beat us at chess and beat us at poker and beat us at a lot of other games, will develop a kind of far-reaching, more general intelligence that allows them to outthink us. That’s why, you know, some of the leaders of the technological pack start imagining futures where human beings are essentially pets of these intelligences or whatever it is.
The question to ask ourselves, one of the questions, anyway, is: Why are we doing this? What thing is it that we need to do that requires us to run these kind of risks. And I don’t think that there’s—sometimes people say, “Well, we should do it because we have to deal with climate change.” And that’s so hard. Look, the human brain, as currently constructed, is perfectly capable of dealing with this, you know? We’ve built great solar panels, great wind turbines, great batteries. We could do what needs to be done. If we wanted to genetically engineer anything, it should probably be the brains of plutocrats, who are so greed-obsessed that they can’t help themselves from trying to wreck it all. But even that, I mean, truthfully, I’d rather beat the Koch brothers than engineer them.
AMY GOODMAN : I mean, on the one hand, you have greater awareness of the climate catastrophe that is upon us. On the other hand, perhaps you have people more disconnected from their physical environment. You, yourself, are deeply—you live in the natural environment.
BILL McKIBBEN: Well, I used to. And more and more, like everybody else, I live my life on Twitter and—you know, because that’s the place where we’ve needed to do some of this work. But, man, it’s a Faustian bargain. I mean, the—
AMY GOODMAN : Just like kids are online relating, less than they’re actually relating to people, which causes a very serious psychological disconnect.
BILL McKIBBEN: It’s one of the reasons, by the way, that this Greta Thunberg movement of climate strikes is so wonderful. And one of the things that made it possible—and Greta will say this herself—is she’s autistic. And she’s talked about it a lot. She says, “You know what? I’m able to focus on one thing all the time,” which is something that—you know, ability to focus is definitely something that we’re yielding up.
AMY GOODMAN : She said two things: focusing on one thing all the time and seeing everything in black and white.
BILL McKIBBEN: Yeah, understanding that there are places where we really do have to make choices. Look, we’re at such an interesting moment in so many ways. We’re going to find out, in the next 10, 20, 30 years, whether we have some hope of preserving the planet and, with it, the civilizations that we’re accustomed to, and whether we’re capable of preserving the idea of human beings as something not just useful, but kind of beautiful. Look, it’s easy to get annoyed with ourselves, you know? I get upset that human beings have done such a poor job of responding to these threats, of allowing so much injustice, whatever. Human beings are also, at root, funny and kind and capable of great love. Those are things machines will never be capable of, and we shouldn’t sacrifice them easily.
AMY GOODMAN : Finally, the phenomenon of Trump and all that he is denying right now, you know, obviously, starting with climate change, saying it’s a Chinese hoax, though no one actually believes he actually believes that, then winning the election. You were a big Bernie Sanders supporter. Now Bernie Sanders is going to the Trump supporters to try to win them over. Your thoughts on that and whether you think climate change is a way to approach people, that people understand, across the political spectrum, when fires burn down their houses, when their property is flooded?
BILL McKIBBEN: So, it’s not just that climate change is a way to talk across the political spectrum. So are the answers to climate change. I mean, oddly, the single most popular thing in America, when people poll about it, the one thing that everybody agrees they like is solar panels. They poll at 80% among Republicans, independents and Democrats—maybe for different reasons. I mean, I think sometimes that conservatives like the idea of a solar panel on their roof so they can isolate themselves from everyone and everything, you know? But that’s a really good place to start.
And I think also people increasingly understand that we’re in severe problems in terms of economic security for people. One of the things about the Green New Deal that’s going to strike a chord is this guarantee of a federal job, if you want one, to do the work that needs to be done making this country a habitable place. I think that that’s also one of the answers to this encroaching artificial intelligence and the automation of our livelihoods and so on and so forth.
It’s hard to—I mean, you know, it’s hard to overestimate the stakes of the moment. I try to, in that subtitle, say, take them as high as I can: Has the Human Game Begun to Play Itself Out? That’s, for the first time, a very real possibility. The good news is that there are at least some people who are thinking about it and working hard.
AMY GOODMAN : What would playing itself out look like?
BILL McKIBBEN: Well, you know, we used to say, “Will the world end with a bang or a whimper?” I think it’s possible that the world will end with, you know, the gurgle of a rising ocean and the soft beep of some digital system taking over.
AMY GOODMAN : What do you mean?
BILL McKIBBEN: That those are things that we have the most to fear, this ongoing degradation of the physical world and this encroachment of a different world, the digital world, on human flesh and blood, on what we’ve always understood ourselves to be.
AMY GOODMAN : And the alternative?
BILL McKIBBEN: The alternative is the noisy, raucous world of human solidarity, where we unite not only to take on climate change, but to take on the people who made it possible, to bring down those people who have built a world so unequal in wealth and power that it threatens our survival.
AMY GOODMAN : And do you see the presidential election mattering in 2020?

AMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report . I’m Amy Goodman, with Juan González.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: Well, Minnesota freshman Congressmember Ilhan Omar says death threats against her have spiked in number since President Trump tweeted a video juxtaposing her image with footage of the 9/11 attacks. Trump posted the 43-second video Friday with the caption, “WE WILL NEVER FORGET .” The president’s tweet intercut video of the World Trade Center towers burning with video of Omar speaking about the increasing attacks on the Muslim American community after 9/11. Omar was speaking at a Council on American-Islamic Relations event last month.
REP . ILHAN OMAR : Far too long, we have lived with the discomfort of being a second-class citizen. And frankly, I’m tired of it, and every single Muslim in this country should be tired of it. CAIR was founded after 9/11, because they recognized that some people did something and that all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: CAIR was in fact founded in 1994. Omar’s spokesperson later said she misspoke and, quote, “meant to refer to the fact that the organization had doubled in size after the Sept. 11 attacks,” end of quote. Congressmember Omar’s comments were originally taken out of context and circulated by right-wing media, from The Daily Caller to Fox News. In a statement, Congressmember Omar said, quote, “Since the president’s tweet Friday evening, I have experienced an increase in direct threats on my life—many directly referencing or replying to the president’s video. This is endangering lives. It has to stop.”
AMY GOODMAN : The hashtag #StandWithIlhan trended as conservative voices continued to attack Congressmember Omar over the weekend. Trump said on Twitter Monday he’s heading to Minnesota. Omar tweeted, “The Great State of Minnesota, where we don’t only welcome immigrants, we send them to Washington #NoBanAct.”
In New York City, Yemeni bodega owners responded to the attacks against Congressmember Omar by announcing they’re boycotting the sale and purchase of the New York Post over its front-page attack on Omar. The Murdoch-owned daily paper featured an image of the burning Twin Towers on 9/11, referencing Omar’s comment out of context, “9/11 Was 'Some People Did Something,'” and the words “Here’s Your Something” in large print over the photo. The Yemeni American Merchants Association said the cover “provoked hatred” and targeted people of the Muslim faith.
To talk more about Congressmember Ilhan Omar, we’re joined by Moustafa Bayoumi, the author of This Muslim American Life: Dispatches from the War on Terror , his recent Guardian piece headlined “Ilhan Omar has become the target of a dangerous hate campaign.” Moustafa Bayoumi is an English professor at Brooklyn College in the City University of New York, also the author of How Does It Feel to Be a Problem? Being Young and Arab in America .
Welcome back to Democracy Now! It’s great to have you with us. Talk about what others have said over time. This is the argument you make in your piece, “Ilhan Omar has become the target of a dangerous hate campaign.” Give us a few quotes.
MOUSTAFA BAYOUMI : Sure. Well, I mean, if you think—if you just have even a short-term memory, I think you can remember that George W. Bush, the former president of the United States, said something to the effect of—when referring to the 9/11 attackers, said something to the effect of, “Well, these folks committed this act.”
AMY GOODMAN : Wait. Actually, we’ve got that clip.
PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH : … full resources of the federal government go to help the victims and their families and to conduct a full-scale investigation to hunt down and to find those folks who committed this act.
AMY GOODMAN : “To find the folks who committed this act.”
MOUSTAFA BAYOUMI : Yeah. So, that, in—to my ear, that sounds quite similar to what Ilhan Omar said. And, in fact, George Bush is saying it to the whole country, and he’s not considered to be anti-American for that statement whatsoever. So, in fact, I think what Ilhan Omar is saying is completely within the boundaries of what is normal political discourse in this country. And we could go one. That’s one example.
Another example would be Ilhan Omar is now accused of claiming that—her detractors will say that she claims that Jewish people in the United States suffer from a dual loyalty campaign. Well, in fact, actually, she did not say that. So, I think it’s important to qualify what she did say and what she did not say. She talked about questions of allegiance. And if we listen to your last segment and we talk about anti- BDS laws, in fact, those are in fact allegiance laws that are built into now the very system of the United States. However, somebody did say something that was in fact claiming dual loyalty for Jewish Americans, and that would be our president now, Donald Trump.
AMY GOODMAN : Explain what he said.
MOUSTAFA BAYOUMI : He said something to the effect of—when speaking to a Jewish American group, he said something about—
AMY GOODMAN : The Jewish Republican Coalition in Las Vegas last week.
MOUSTAFA BAYOUMI : In fact, that’s right. And he said, “Well, let me talk about your prime minister.” So he referred to Benjamin Netanyahu as their prime minister.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: How do you account for this enormous campaign that has been launched against this freshman congressmember in terms of by so many conservatives and right-wing groups in the country and by the president himself? In your sense, what’s behind it?
MOUSTAFA BAYOUMI : Well, on one level, it’s very clear. Ilhan Omar is one of two Muslim women elected to Congress, the first two Muslim women elected to Congress. That gives her, I think, a certain level of prominence, along with a certain level of vulnerability. Not only that, but, of course, being openly Muslim, she wears hijab. She covers her hair. She’s a refugee. She’s an immigrant. She’s a black woman. So she occupies all of those vulnerable positions in our society today.
But it’s not only that, I believe, if you ask me, because if she were a quiet black refugee woman from Somalia, Muslim who covered her hair, and all of that stuff, then I think people would love to trot her out for the optics alone. But she’s not a quiet congresswoman. In fact, I think that’s a great thing. In fact, she seems to be a highly principled and highly effective politician, even just in the short time that she’s been in Congress. So, I think that, in fact, she’s a scary figure to a lot of people who are on the right, and even sometimes to the mainstream establishment of the Democratic Party, as well.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: That was going to be my follow-up. What about the reaction of the establishment of the Democratic Party to the threats against her and to the scapegoating of her?
MOUSTAFA BAYOUMI : Yes. Well, you know, I think that what we saw was in fact, in some ways, a litmus test of where the Democratic leadership and also those vying for the presidency lie on one of the more important issues of our day, which is Islamophobia, fundamentally. What we saw with Nancy Pelosi’s statement, for example, on Ilhan Omar was, I thought, extremely disappointing. I thought she was refusing to name Ilhan Omar explicitly, was not—didn’t come out in her defense, and in fact was backhandedly accusing her of sacralizing—or, desacralizing, I should say, the 9/11 territory, which was not the point of this controversy at all. So, I thought that Nancy Pelosi’s response was, in fact, quite shameful.
AMY GOODMAN : And now she’s being attacked for criticizing Stephen Miller for his fierce anti-immigrant views, being told that because she’s talking about Stephen Miller in the administration, she is singling out a Jewish member of the administration, which proves she is anti-Semitic. We had on Dr. David Glosser, who is Stephen Miller’s uncle, his sister’s son, who criticized his nephew for his extremist anti-immigrant views.
MOUSTAFA BAYOUMI : Yeah, exactly. I mean, does that mean that Ilhan Omar can only criticize Ilhan Omar? That would be the natural result of that. She’s not criticizing Stephen Miller for his Jewishness. She’s criticizing Stephen Miller for the positions that he holds. And that’s completely within the boundaries of American political discourse.
AMY GOODMAN : So what does this mean for Muslims around the country? Ilhan Omar says she herself has faced this spike in death threats against her. President Trump pinning the tweet of the video where he’s juxtaposed the 9/11 attacks with Ilhan Omar? We know about the attacks on the Tree of Life synagogue, the 11 Jewish worshipers that were killed, with the killer citing the same words that President Trump used—”invaders,”“invasion.” President Trump’s words and what he tweets has meaning.
MOUSTAFA BAYOUMI : Absolutely. In fact, there was a study that was performed last year—that was published last year, that said that there’s a direct correlation with Donald Trump’s anti-Muslim tweets and the rise in anti-Muslim hate crimes. So, Twitter and hate crimes, unfortunately, are connected. And they’re not only connected in the United States, they’re connected internationally, as well. That’s what the study found. And, in fact, not only is what Donald Trump tweeted completely disturbing, but it’s also coming within weeks of 50 people being killed in New Zealand in two different mosques by a man who also felt himself connected to President Trump and his ideology.
AMY GOODMAN : And let’s not forget what the New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern responded to President Trump when he asked what can he do, when he called the prime minister, and she said, “Respect the Muslim community,” as she then put on hijab herself to comfort the families of those killed. We want to thank you, Moustafa Bayoumi, for being here, author of This Muslim American Life: Dispatches from the War on Terror , professor at Brooklyn College.

Critics are demanding answers after the Trump administration refused to allow prominent Palestinian human rights activist Omar Barghouti to enter the United States for a speaking tour, despite his valid U.S. visa. Barghouti is co-founder of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement, or BDS , an international campaign to pressure Israel to comply with international law and respect Palestinian rights. When he arrived at the Ben Gurion Airport in Tel Aviv on April 10, Barghouti was told the United States was denying him entry. He was not given an explanation. Barghouti and his supporters say the move was motivated by his involvement with the BDS movement, calling it a form of “McCarthyite repression.” We reached Omar Barghouti in Ramallah to talk about his travel ban, the growth of the BDS movement and attempts to quash it, and the recent Israeli election that saw Benjamin Netanyahu re-elected prime minister for a fifth term.

AMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report . I’m Amy Goodman, with Juan González.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: We turn now to the ongoing crackdown on pro-Palestinian activism here in the United States. Critics are demanding answers after the Trump administration refused to allow prominent Palestinian human rights activist Omar Barghouti to enter the United States last week, despite his having a valid U.S. visa. Barghouti is co-founder of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement, or BDS , an international campaign to pressure Israel to comply with international law and respect Palestinian rights. He was scheduled to be in the U.S. this week to speak at Harvard and NYU and meet with lawmakers in Washington, D.C. But when he arrived at the Ben Gurion Airport in Tel Aviv on Wednesday, April 10th, Barghouti was told that the United States was denying him entry. He was not given an explanation. Omar Barghouti and his supporters say the move was motivated by his involvement with the BDS movement, calling it a form of, quote, “McCarthyite repression.”
AMY GOODMAN : This is just the latest attack on the BDS movement in the United States, which has gained steam in recent years. More than a hundred measures targeting boycotts and other acts of Palestinian solidarity have been introduced in state and local legislatures and in Congress since 2014. According to the website Palestine Legal, at least 27 states have now adopted anti-boycott laws, including five executive orders issued by governors. Earlier this year on Capitol Hill, senators passed a bill that included a controversial anti- BDS provision aimed at preventing opposition to the Israeli government by allowing state and local governments to sanction U.S. companies boycotting Israel.
Well, for more, we are turning to Omar Barghouti. He was scheduled to join us here in our Democracy Now! studio in New York today, but instead he’s joining us from Ramallah in the West Bank. Omar Barghouti is the author of Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions: The Global Struggle for Palestinian Rights .
Omar, welcome to Democracy Now! Can you describe what happened when you got to the airport in Tel Aviv on Wednesday?
OMAR BARGHOUTI : Sure. The airline told me there was an issue with my visa. And there wasn’t. My visa was valid until 2021. So they called the U.S. Consulate in Tel Aviv. And after a long delay, just as I was boarding, they prevented me from boarding, saying that the U.S. Consulate had told them that there’s an “immigration issue,” a ban of sorts by the U.S. immigration against me, which was quite unbelievable. I’ve been to the United States many, many, many times, including on this same visa.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Omar Barghouti, in the past it’s been Israel that has tried to limit your ability to travel and banned you. How were you able to get a suspension of the Israeli efforts to stop you from traveling? And were you surprised that this time it was the United States that stepped in?
OMAR BARGHOUTI : Yes, indeed. Since 2014, Israel has prevented me—or tried, quite a few times—prevented me from traveling, through de jure and de facto travel bans, by refusing to renew my Israeli travel permit, without which I cannot leave and re-enter the country. This was condemned by Amnesty International, including very recently, in February of this year, as an arbitrary measure of punishing me for my human rights activities in the BDS movement.
Indeed, this was quite surprising that Israel has outsourced this type of micro-repression of the BDS movement to its allies in the White House. Israel has outsourced quite a lot of its repressive, McCarthyite policies to the United States. As your report correctly mentioned, 27 state legislatures have passed clearly unconstitutional, anti-democratic, anti- BDS measures. But this is the first time, that we’re aware of, that this micro level of repression is done by the U.S. as a proxy for Israel.
AMY GOODMAN : Can you respond to your denial by the Trump administration into the United States? What do you have to say to them?
OMAR BARGHOUTI : Yes. I think this is just another step that shows how this right-wing administration, which is completely in alliance with Israel’s far-right regime, is terrified of our voices, is terrified of telling the truth. They’re trying to prevent me from meeting U.S. lawmakers in Congress, mainstream media, to speak at a synagogue, to speak at Harvard and NYU , and so on and so forth, and certainly denying me the right to be with my daughter for her wedding, which is happening next Sunday. So, by this, the U.S. administration is just adding to its already very deep record of complicity in Israel’s violations of international law, but this time they’re violating U.S. law, because this is an ideological and political exclusion. And ACLU , PEN U.S. and other organizations are investigating this issue, whether the U.S. State Department is denying me entry over my human rights views.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: I wanted to ask you, as a founder of the BDS movement—and you’ve been watching the increased efforts worldwide by the Israeli government to squelch and repress the BDS movement—your reaction to the recent reports that ex-Mossad agents have harassed U.S. students and BDS activists here in the United States in an effort to intimidate them?
OMAR BARGHOUTI : There are so many ways of intimidation that Israel has resorted to, Israel and its lobby groups, whether the traditional Jewish establishment lobby or the Christian Zionist lobby. They’re involved in true McCarthyism. I mean, I call it McCarthyism 2.0, an evolved form of the earlier McCarthyism, with loyalty to Israel being the litmus test.
But Israel is certainly spying on U.S. citizens who are active in the BDS movement, as revealed in Al Jazeera’s documentary report, The Lobby , and as Alain Gresh wrote in Le Monde Diplomatique , and Electronic Intifada have revealed. Israel is indeed spying and using legal persecution against activists to silence BDS activists. Several of Israel’s lobby groups are funding the so-called Canary Mission, which is smearing activists on campus, especially Jewish activists, who support Palestinian rights. And they realilze that the number of Jewish activists in the U.S. who support Palestinian rights, and even who support BDS , is in the ascendance.
AMY GOODMAN : I wanted to go back to an interview we did last year, when we spoke to Bahia Amawi, a speech pathologist who’s filed a lawsuit against the Pflugerville Independent School District in Texas and the Texas state attorney general, after being forced out of her position for refusing to sign a pro-Israel pledge in her contract. Amawi explained she doesn’t consider herself a BDS activist but does try to avoid purchasing products that support the Israeli occupation.
BAHIA AMAWI : I am not actually an active member of the BDS at all. Just personally, for myself, if I’m aware of a product that is—you know, supports Israel or is made in the country, then I just have a personal—I make a personal choice to avoid it, because I don’t want to support their ongoing occupation and aggression and subhumane treatment of the Palestinians, that’s making me kind of like a silent participant complicit with the whole occupation. So, I actually—I’m not aware of it. I don’t even go through and find out the list of things. I just happen to know about it, or, you know, if somehow I find out, then I just avoid it. But other than that, really, I’m not an active member.
AMY GOODMAN : So, she declined to sign her contract, she said, quote, which said she “will not boycott Israel during the term of the contracts” and that she will not take any action that’s, quote, “intended to penalize, inflict economic harm on, or limit commercial relations with Israel.” This was in her contract as a speech pathologist with the company that was working in the schools, and she had been a beloved speech pathologist there for years. Omar Barghouti, how common is this?
OMAR BARGHOUTI : This is quite common. Most of the 27 state legislatures that have passed anti- BDS laws or signed executive orders by governors look very much the same. They’re suppressing the free speech of American citizens. And it’s as ACLU has called it; it’s reminiscent of McCarthy-era loyalty oaths. And those contracts say that you will not engage in a boycott of Israel or of the territories “under Israel’s control.” That is the occupied Palestinian territory or the occupied Syrian territory. Israel and its lobby make no distinction between Israel in the pre-’67 border and the occupied territory of 1967.
And indeed this is raising concern among liberals, in general, not just supporters of Palestinian rights. We’re seeing that across the United States. People understand very vividly, especially people of color, especially women, LGBTQ groups and so on, understand vividly that if Israel and its lobby get away with undermining the U.S. Constitution, the First Amendment, by suppressing free speech on Palestine, no one is safe. No one is safe. No one can tell who’s next. As the earlier version of McCarthyism has shown us, it wasn’t about the communists. It was about all dissenters, all those opposed to U.S. imperialism and intervention and right-wing politics. Similarly, this McCarthyism 2.0 will not stop at Palestine supporters, will not stop at silencing pro-Palestine voices. It will go on to suppress other justice struggles, be it climate justice, gender justice, sexual justice, ethnic, religious justice and racial justice.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Omar Barghouti, I wanted to ask you about the latest news about Airbnb. Originally, Airbnb, after protests by human rights activists, had agreed to remove the listings of thousands of homes of Jewish settlers in the West Bank that had been listed previously on their site. But then, just yesterday, they reversed that, and they said they’re going to keep those listings on, even though, obviously, these are listings in a territory where there are illegal settlements, according to international law. Your reaction to Airbnb apparently caving in to pressure?
OMAR BARGHOUTI : Indeed. Yes, Airbnb has fallen—has surrendered to Israel’s bullying, and bullying by Israel’s lobby in the United States, in a very shameful way indeed. Instead of calling Israel’s settlements as they are, as the United Nations and almost the entire international community calls them, illegal settlements, illegal economies in occupied territory, that no one should deal with, Airbnb has bowed to Israel’s pressure and is not going to delist those settlement properties. That’s a clear violation of international law, and it will subject Airbnb to possible boycotts by human rights activists around the world.
AMY GOODMAN : Can you talk about what’s happened in Israel in the last week and how it affects you? The election, once again, the record five-term Netanyahu, despite the fact that the attorney general says he’s going to charge him with corruption, what does it mean for where you are, in the West Bank, and Gaza?
OMAR BARGHOUTI : I think Palestinians can expect really troubling times ahead, really darker—a darker era of repression, of violation of our rights, land theft, resource theft, a more brutal siege on Gaza, more ethnic cleansing in Jerusalem and the Negev and the Jordan Valley. We can expect all that to escalate, with fascist forces, openly fascist forces, potentially joining the next Netanyahu government, the so-called Jewish Power party, which is a Kahanist party, that is absolutely fascist and openly calls for ethnic cleansing. At least they’re honest. Other more mainstream Israeli parties endorse ethnic cleansing of Palestinians and indeed are doing it piecemeal everywhere, but they’re not calling it that. So, at least Israel, with this new government, might lose its final mask, its really worn-out, thin mask of “democracy,” as it never was. Since its creation, Israel has always been an apartheid state. And now its claim to democracy, its claim to liberalism are completely shattered with this latest election.
On the one hand, this will cause more suffering to us, Palestinians everywhere, in the 1967 area, in the 1948 area, in Israel’s pre-'67 borders. And certainly Palestinian refugees in exile will be even further denied their basic rights. But there's also a silver lining, because Israel’s real face as an apartheid, colonial regime is being exposed to the whole world. And it’s being at the center of the rising far-right, white supremacist and fascist tendencies, from Bolsonaro in Brazil to Orbán in Hungary to the White House and many in between. So, with this, with this exposure, with this loss of any mask, this will further escalate the BDS movement and other solidarity movements to isolate Israel’s regime of oppression in all fields, academic, cultural, economic and otherwise.
AMY GOODMAN : We want to thank you very much for being with us, Omar Barghouti, a Palestinian human rights defender, co-founder of the—

The U.N. is warning the spread of measles is on the rise around the world. The number of cases reported in the first three months of 2019 is three times higher than the same time last year. The highly contagious infection kills 100,000 people every year, mostly children. All regions around the world have been hit by the recent outbreak, with Africa reporting the greatest spike, up 700% since 2018. The U.N. says the most affected countries are Ukraine, Madagascar and India. Although the disease is preventable, lack of access to vaccinations in poorer countries has helped contribute to the recent surge in cases.
Last week, New York City declared a public health emergency, mandating the vaccination in some parts of Brooklyn, where Orthodox Jewish communities, which have particularly low vaccination rates, have been hit hard by the outbreak.

A woman is suing controversial Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz for defamation in relation to an ongoing sexual abuse case involving his client, billionaire sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Virginia Giuffre—who alleges Epstein sexually abused and trafficked her in the early 2000s starting when she was 16 years old—says that Dershowitz participated in the sex trafficking, and accuses him of later falsely claiming she fabricated the accusations and that he had never met her.
The lawsuit, filed in the Southern District of New York Tuesday, brings to light an affidavit by Maria Farmer, a former employee of Epstein’s who says she frequently witnessed school-age girls coming to Epstein’s New York City mansion, and that on a number of occasions Dershowitz would “go upstairs” with the underage girls. Dershowitz has denied the claims. Farmer also revealed she and her sister were also assaulted by Epstein, as well as his alleged madam, Ghislaine Maxwell. She was 26 at the time of the alleged assaults in 1996, and her sister just 15. Dershowitz, who is a close friend of Epstein’s, helped him secure a plea deal after he was arrested in 2006 for sexually abusing dozens of underage girls in Florida. Topics: Rutgers Univ.

JUAN GONZÁLEZ: Extinction Rebellion. That’s the name of the movement shutting down Central London this week in a series of direct actions as activists close bridges, occupy public landmarks and even superglue themselves to buildings to demand urgent action to combat climate change. Police have arrested more than 300 people so far, and the protests are continuing. Today, activists have halted trains at Canary Wharf—a financial hub of the city—with two protesters climbing a train car and another supergluing his hand to a train window. Earlier this week, protesters shut down Waterloo Bridge and Oxford Circus, with others supergluing themselves to the British headquarters of the Shell Oil Company. This is Farhana Yamin, a leading climate lawyer and Extinction Rebellion activist who superglued her hands to the pavement in front of the Shell building.
FARHANA YAMIN : Stop lobbying governments to delay action. These prove to me that the legal process is pretty broken right now. And we’re having to break law rather than make law, because of the inaction of 30 years now of these companies.
AMY GOODMAN : In a separate act of nonviolent civil disobedience, four activists glued and chained themselves under a vehicle parked on the Waterloo Bridge. This is climate activist Ben Moss.
BEN MOSS : We glued ourselves to this so that this vehicle could not be moved by the police last night. The reason why we’re doing that is that we want to secure this bridge as part of the actions for Extinction Rebellion. We’re doing this because we want the government to take action about the climate crisis, about the ecological collapse that we’re facing. There has been too much inaction. There has been inaction for too long. And so we’re taking radical action to make sure that the government acts on what is our collective responsibility.
AMY GOODMAN : The protests are taking place across Europe and around the world as part of a week-long campaign organized by Extinction Rebellion. The group started in the United Kingdom just last year and has now spread to dozens of countries. The growing collective of activists are demanding governments commit to legally binding measures to slash consumption, reduce carbon emissions to net zero by 2025 and create a citizens’ assembly to oversee progress.
Environmental journalist and activist George Monbiot wrote in a column for The Guardian , “The success of this mobilisation depends on us. It will reach the critical threshold only if enough of us cast aside denial and despair, and join this exuberant, proliferating movement. The time for excuses is over. The struggle to overthrow our life-denying system has begun,” he said.
For more, we go to London, where we’re joined by two guests: Clare Farrell, one of the co-founders of the environmental action group Extinction Rebellion, and we’re joined by Farhana Yamin, a leading environmental lawyer, who helped negotiate the landmark 2015 Paris Agreement. She has now joined the rebellion. She was arrested after supergluing herself to the Shell headquarters in London yesterday.
We welcome you both to Democracy Now! Farhana, let’s begin with you. You’re just out of jail. Can you explain what you did yesterday, why you got arrested?
FARHANA YAMIN : Yeah. I joined the mass civil disobedience that has started in London beginning on Monday, and I did it because of the inaction of companies like Shell, who have funded campaigns of misinformation and lobbied governments to not take action, which is why we’re here at this critical time. And just to let you know, that this mass civil disobedience is happening all around the world, and, today especially, Extinction Rebellion is standing in solidarity with all of those people who have been fighting climate injustice from around the world. I think there are around 50 countries that are involved in the international support for the rebellion that’s taking here in London, and each one of those is fighting against land degradation, against human rights abuses and against the toxicity and pollution in their own countries. So we salute all of those movements out in the rest of the world. Thank you.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Clare Farrell, as co-founder of Extinction Rebellion, could you talk about the urgency that you and the supporters of your movement feel right now and why you felt it so necessary to do this massive civil disobedience?
CLARE FARRELL : Well, yes. As Farhana says, it’s been well over 30 years of denial and time wasting, really, and we’ve pushed ourselves up against the edge of a window of time frame that we have to act. And, you know, carbon emissions are still going up. They’re set to go up again this year. So, globally, the facts are quite clear that we’re on a catastrophic course, and we’ve wasted a huge amount of time. We’re not prepared to stand by and watch us waste the very small window that we have left.
AMY GOODMAN : Farhana Yamin, can you describe the action yesterday?
FARHANA YAMIN : The action actually started on Monday with protesters climbing onto the facade—there’s a balcony—outside the unmarked building, which is the Shell headquarters in the U.K. And they honored the work of Polly Higgins, who has been campaigning for ecocide law, which is essentially to hold to account companies and governments for the criminal damage to the Earth. And I protested there yesterday as that action was ending, because I feel, you know, it’s absurd that I was walking off in handcuffs for criminal damage to the Shell building, when Shell itself has been one of the main biggest polluters who has caused the largest amount of irreversible, very serious harm that is happening all around the world, the climate destruction that we’re seeing as a result of 30 years of too little, too late.
AMY GOODMAN : You glued your hands?
FARHANA YAMIN : I did, yeah. And it’s the very first time that I’ve done anything like this, so I, yeah, probably used a little bit too much superglue, and they were completely bolted down on the pavement. I had tried to get to the door, but that wasn’t possible.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And what was the reaction of the police to this relatively new tactic of supergluing of the various protesters? How were they able to finally get you free?
FARHANA YAMIN : Well, the supergluing actions have been going on for some time, actually, and so I don’t think I did anything particularly new, other than to do that myself. And there are special solvents that they use, and the police acted with utter professionalism and courtesy. So, for me, the most important thing was to stand in solidarity with all of the people around the world who are seeing climate devastation, especially in developing countries. That’s who I’ve acted for in the climate change negotiations—the small island states, the least-developed countries, especially those in Africa, who are seeing the consequences of water shortages and will be experiencing, and already are, famines and droughts that are directly implicated by climate change.
AMY GOODMAN : You’re certainly acting in every arena, Farhana Yamin. You helped draft the 2015 Paris Agreement, credited with getting the goal of net-zero emissions by mid-century into the agreement, acting on behalf of the small island nations. Can you talk about why you’ve moved from working inside the system, this agreement that you helped forge, to direct action?
FARHANA YAMIN : Well, we need those laws. We have got those laws—you know, the Paris Agreement; in the U.K., we have the Climate Change Act. But they’re not delivering enough, and they’re not going fast enough. And in many parts of the world, as you know, in the U.S., Amy, that things are going backwards. We have laws that were put in place that are being repealed or being challenged or being disassembled by fossil fuel interests. So that’s why I’ve added the word “activist” to what I do as a lawyer.
I feel every signal person is now called upon to join Extinction Rebellion’s call for mass civil disobedience, to see that everyone is needed, to shout out very loudly and boldly, wherever they are in the system, and to not just think that this is somebody else’s day job, you know? I’m absolutely committed to the legal process. I believe in the rule of law. I’ll carry on writing and advising, you know, when I can. But right now I feel the most important thing that people can do is come and join us on the streets, come and join whatever rebellion is taking place near you. If there isn’t one, set one up. It’s a very decentralized movement.
And, you know, it’s very similar, in some ways, what’s happening here—we had 1.6 million students around the world on the 12th of March, in nearly every country in the world. You’ve got the Sunrise Movement in the U.S. I think people are beginning to wake up and understand that we, sadly, have to take different measures and slightly extraordinary measures than rely on our elected politicians, that hasn’t delivered so far.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Clare Farrell, could you elaborate on the core demands of your movement to the government—tell the truth about climate change, reduce carbon emissions by 2025 and create citizens’ assemblies to oversee the process?
CLARE FARRELL : Yeah, sure. So, the first demand, on tell the truth, is that we think that because of the grave risk that everybody faces, there should be a public information campaign, which should be the responsibility of any government, to educate the people if they’re in danger, and also to work with other institutions, possibly also the media, whatever it takes, the education sector, to get people to really come up to speed and understand the position that they’re in.
The second demand for net-zero carbon emissions by 2025 has been amended. I believe it also now includes a rapid addressing of the biodiversity crisis.
And the third demand, which I think, personally, is kind of the most exciting, is for a citizens’ assembly on climate change and the extinction crisis. And what that calls for is a structural political change, which I think is crucial for people to understand. Often when you’re interviewed on the mainstream media here, they want to drill down into policy, and they particularly want to talk about what the environmentalists want to take away from them. And, for me, this is absolutely giving something to people in a very big and serious way. And if it happens structurally, then it’s not a policy that can be, you know, massaged figures or whatever. It’s something that, hopefully, will stand to last and significantly restore our democratic process in the U.K.
AMY GOODMAN : And, Clare Farrell, why you named it Extinction—why the group has decided on this name, Extinction Rebellion, and what your plans are, going forward from today?
CLARE FARRELL : Well, I was part of a very long process, actually, to finalize the name. It was quite challenging. I mean, the “Rebellion” part was quite straightforward, because we had been over it, and technically that’s what we were going to organize. The “Extinction” part, I think, is extremely useful, because it helps us not only to reframe the crisis and to name the—you know, the scientific community has admitted that human extinction is a possibility now, but also it feels like it sort of takes it away from just being a climate change debate, and it helps us to talk about the broader picture, which is that we face multiple crises at the moment, and the extinction event is a big part of that. Even if we could fix climate change tomorrow, we’re still losing life at a rate which I think our society and our species can’t really survive. So, yeah, that’s on the name.
And as for the plans coming up, I know that some people climbed on board the—on top of the train today at the DLR station. There are some groups on the street who—I understand, today, Oxford Circus is just receiving a much heavier police presence, and there are lots of arrests. But there will be groups going out and swarming London’s streets, which basically means going and moving, doing mobile, kind of agile and temporary roadblocks, moving around the city. So, if sites do get closed down, groups will be blocking roads in many, many places around the center of London, close to the sites that we’ve already seen closed down for the last few days.
CLARE FARRELL : Just to say, this is the start of a campaign of mass civil disobedience. The intention is that it isn’t over after a few days, but the intention is that, you know, it will catalyze and inspire others to take forward their own actions and become a big mass movement all over the world. So, I hope, in the months and weeks beyond this, that we will see many, many more actions coming up.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Clare, the impact of all of these student strikes that have occurred? And, of course, the Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, 16 years old, is expected to meet with the Pope Francis today. How has that affected sort of the face of the movement around climate change?
CLARE FARRELL : Well, the youth movement is very important. And I think when you look at—when you look at a movement or a moment in history like this, having many movements that support each other is really important. And I had a very interesting conversation recently with the researcher Erica Chenoweth, and she described something in the States which was interesting, that the children who walked out of school over gun control, actually, if you look at the disruptive nature of disobedience and direct action, you know, when those kids walked out of school, they took up the time of the police, they stopped their teachers from doing their jobs, and they pulled their parents out of their jobs, as well, to come and find them, pick them up. And so, for children to walk out of school is extremely powerful, and actually they have a huge capacity to disrupt the lives of the adults that they have contact with. And I believe that that’s had a big impact on American politics, as well, lots of parents deciding to move into that space. So, it’s really exciting to sort of think about the breadth of the impact and the long-term impact, I think, of the youth movement, as well as the energy and the sort of excitement that they also bring.
AMY GOODMAN : And finally, Farhana Yamin, as you were getting arrested, you said, “We’re having to break law rather than make law.” What message do you have to diplomats, to scientists around what needs to be done right now?
FARHANA YAMIN : Oh, come and join, everyone, as part of—become an activist, too. No one is saying stop doing science or stop doing diplomacy, but recognize that those are not going to deliver unless we fundamentally rewire our economies. And part of that means rewiring our political systems, which have not delivered. And those systems at the moment are hijacked or corrupted and too slow or, you know, obsessed with many other things. And it takes disruption of this kind to, frankly, push some of those things off the agenda and start focusing on the crisis that’s affecting humanity. And that’s—
AMY GOODMAN : And your message to President Trump? Thirty seconds.
FARHANA YAMIN : Oh, President Trump, I think, is, in some ways, aware of how big the climate crisis is. I think he’s just dealing with it in ways that sort of deny what can be done through the creativity and ingenuity of human beings, which is that we can transform our societies, and we can use renewable energies, we can use solidarity, we can use resilience and community building, to address all the impacts that we will have. I think that that’s what happened with the moonshot. You know, we had lots of different technologies developed from that, that actually made us more prosperous and made us—you know, gave us hope. So, I hope that President Trump can put his faith in all the things that are going on in the U.S. economy to decarbonize it and to build resilience.
AMY GOODMAN : Farhana Yamin, we want to thank you for being with us, international environmental lawyer who helped draft the landmark 2015 Paris Agreement, that President Trump is pulling the United States out of. She was arrested outside the Shell headquarters in London Tuesday after supergluing her hands to the ground. Clare Farrell is co-founder of Extinction Rebellion.

Back in the United States, Extinction Rebellion activists took aim at the Republican Party, protesting in front of the Republican National Committee headquarters in Washington, D.C. Capitol police arrested a reported eight members of the group as they occupied city streets. Demonstrators called on passersby to support their actions and take a stand against fossil fuel-funded politicians.
Extinction Rebellion activist : “The RNC has been called the biggest criminal enterprise in the history of our species. They are the center of climate denial. We’re out here today as part of the international Extinction Rebellion to let the RNC know that we know what they’re doing. We’re going to continue to call attention to their denial, to how they’re ruining our planet.”
More actions across the U.S., the U.K. and other parts of the world are expected in the coming days. Topics: "

AMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! I’m Amy Goodman, with Juan González.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: Well, the International Criminal Court has announced it will not investigate possible war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by the United States and other actors in Afghanistan. The court suggested the U.S.'s lack of cooperation with the investigation was behind the decision. Earlier this month, the U.S. government revoked the visa of the ICC 's chief prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda. This came after the Trump administration announced it would bar entry to any ICC investigators probing alleged war crimes by the U.S. military in Afghanistan.
AMY GOODMAN : A 2016 report by the International Criminal Court accused the U.S. military of torturing at least 61 prisoners in Afghanistan during the ongoing war. The report also accused the CIA of subjecting at least 27 prisoners to torture, including rape, at CIA prison sites in Afghanistan, Poland, Romania and Lithuania.
For more, we’re joined by Katherine Gallagher, a senior staff attorney at the Center for Constitutional Rights. She filed victims’ representations with the Pre-Trial Chamber in support of the investigation.
Welcome to Democracy Now! What’s happened here?
KATHERINE GALLAGHER : Well, what we saw on Friday was a very dangerous decision from the Pre-Trial Chamber of the ICC . It was profoundly misguided. If what the Pre-Trial Chamber claims it wanted to do was bolster the credibility of the International Criminal Court and operate in the interests of justice, including the interests of victims, it went in the opposite direction. The only people who could be applauding this decision, frankly, are Donald Trump and John Bolton.
You had victims’ groups from Afghanistan, victims’ representations of individuals who were detained as part of the U.S. torture program, file victims’ representations on behalf of tens of thousands of people. Back in the winter of 2017, 2018, Afghan civil society groups literally risked their lives to collect victims’ representations, to say, “Make this investigation go forward. End impunity.” The same happened in my case of getting victims’ representations from two men who continue to be detained in Guantánamo. We all said that this investigation is in the interests of justice. And the Pre-Trial Chamber, bizarrely, frankly, said it is not. One can only conclude that this is the result of some serious political pressure by the United States, including not only on the court, but member states of the court.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: Well, I wanted to ask you about the implications. It’s not just the Trump administration, but, clearly, some former Bush officials, like Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld, are also glad these days of this decision. But what’s the implication of the ability of the U.S. government to effectively intimidate an international body like this?
KATHERINE GALLAGHER : And that’s precisely why it’s such a dangerous decision. It sends the message that bullying works. So, whether for Russia, who right now is looking to be investigated for Georgia and Ukraine, whether for Israel—of course, Palestine joined the ICC—this says, “Obstruct, and you will be rewarded with impunity.” So, I think, for the member states, of whom there are 122, who believe in international justice, they need to send the clear message, “We back the court, and this investigation should proceed.”
AMY GOODMAN : President Trump applauded the decision, saying in a statement, “Since the creation of the ICC , the United States has consistently declined to join the court because of its broad, unaccountable prosecutorial powers; the threat it poses to American sovereignty; and other deficiencies that render it illegitimate. Any attempt to target American, Israeli, or allied personnel for prosecution will be met with a swift and vigorous response.” And explain the response. For example, what happened with one of the ICC judges?
KATHERINE GALLAGHER : Sure. So, a couple of things to unpack there. First of all, it’s true the United States is not a member state of the ICC . The reason why individuals can come within the jurisdiction of the court is because the U.S. chose to operate on the territory of member states. It chose to set up black sites, detention centers, commit acts of torture. So, it has brought itself, through its actions of a global rendition and torture program, into the purview of the ICC .
In terms of responses from the court, we did see statements made, but I frankly don’t think we saw a strong enough response for member states. That includes those states in Eastern Europe—Lithuania, Poland and Romania—and the other European states, or Jordan or Djibouti, states that are implicated in ways of furthering the torture program. What did they say to the ICC prosecutor? Did they pledge their support? That, I think, is something that we want to see happen, if this appeal, which we understand the prosecutor will be filing, will go forward.
And in terms of U.S. officials, you mentioned Dick Cheney and George Bush. There’s George Tenet. These are all individuals who could be within the scope of the investigation. There’s also Gina Haspel. She’s a person who ran a black site, not in Afghanistan, as far as we know, but she is now the head of the CIA , for a president who we’ve seen, time and time again, does not believe in the rule of law, and believes that he is above the law. So, when he has Gina Haspel running the CIA right now, we have to ask: What is happening in other countries around the world? What is it that they don’t want investigated? These are not crimes only of the past.
And if you ask Afghan civil society, they will say this also gives a green light to the Taliban. The purported reason for why the U.S. went to endless war in Afghanistan was to protect Afghan civilians. And with this decision, it’s done the absolute opposite. It’s empowered impunity and empowered warlords.
AMY GOODMAN : Katie Gallagher, I wanted to switch topics. Trump issued the second veto of his presidency Tuesday, blocking a congressional effort to end U.S. support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen, which has killed thousands of civilians, leading to the greatest humanitarian catastrophe in the world. Your response?
KATHERINE GALLAGHER : Well, we saw, finally, a very, very late response from Congress, saying, “Let’s get out of the business of assisting war crimes and crimes against humanity”—what has been happening against Yemeni civilians for years now. And in the face of finally saying, “Let’s stop backing Saudi Arabia,” this is what Donald Trump did. It is, again, another example of lawlessness, of impunity, of a lack of care about civilians, of individuals. It’s more cruelty. So…
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And in the little time we have left, Attorney General Barr’s decision—directive to immigration judges to deny bond to those who are seeking—who are detained and are seeking asylum in the United States?
KATHERINE GALLAGHER : Well, the first reaction would be to remind everyone that asylum—seeking asylum is not a crime. And, in fact, under international conventions, like the Refugee Convention or the Convention Against Torture, which prohibits sending a person back to a place where they’ll be tortured, it is actually a right. It is a human right to seek asylum. And what the Trump administration, through Barr’s proposal, is setting forth is something that, again, is unbound by law, both international law and contrary to U.S. law, which says that asylum seekers and people—people—deserve due process. So, it’s, again, another truly lawless and cruel move.
AMY GOODMAN : Well, we want to thank you so much for being with us, Katherine Gallagher, senior staff attorney at the Center for Constitutional Rights.

At least four people died in heavy shelling on Tuesday in the capital city of Tripoli. According to the United Nations, over 170 people have been killed and 750 injured since a Libyan warlord launched an assault on Tripoli on April 5. The fighting pits the U.N.-backed Government of National Accord against a militia led by former Libyan General Khalifa Haftar, who already controls much of eastern Libya. The Libyan government has accused the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Egypt of funding and arming Haftar, who has dual U.S.-Libyan citizenship. Meanwhile, Qatar has called for the enforcement of an arms embargo against Haftar.

AMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! I’m Amy Goodman, with Juan González.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: We turn now to Libya, where at least four people died in heavy shelling on Tuesday in the capital city of Tripoli. According to the United Nations, over 170 people have been killed and 750 injured since a Libyan warlord launched an assault on Tripoli on April 5th. The fighting pits the U.N.-backed Government of National Accord against a militia led by former Libyan General Khalifa Haftar, who already controls much of eastern Libya. The Libyan government has accused the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Egypt of funding and arming Haftar, who has dual U.S.-Libyan citizenship. Meanwhile, Qatar has called for the enforcement of an arms embargo against Haftar. Libyans have taken to the streets to protest the escalating violence.
DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER AHMED MAITEEQ : There is a troop invasion of Tripoli from Haftar and his military. They were starting to attack the capital of Libya, Tripoli, and the Government of National Accord, the legitimate government of Libya. This has happened around 13 days ago. Today, the position of the government is really clear: This is a coup. And he have to go back with his troops to where he was before this all happening.
AMY GOODMAN : That’s Libyan Deputy Prime Minister Ahmed Maiteeq.
The fighting has displaced nearly 18,000 people, but authorities fear the humanitarian crisis could quickly escalate if the fighting continues. Human rights groups are also sounding the alarm over the safety of the many migrants and refugees who pass through Libya, thousands of whom are currently in migrant prisons. Libya has been plagued by factional fighting since a U.S.-led NATO intervention in 2011 toppled longtime authoritarian leader Muammar Gaddafi.
To talk more about the escalating violence, we go now to London to speak with Libya political analyst Anas El Gomati, director of the Tripoli-based Sadeq Institute, Libya’s first independent research organization.
Welcome to Democracy Now!
ANAS EL GOMATI : Thank you, Amy.
AMY GOODMAN : For people who have no idea about what’s going on in Libya, can you explain what exactly is taking place? Who is Haftar? What is the U.N.-backed government? What’s happening? Why are people dying?
ANAS EL GOMATI : There has been—since the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011, there have been at least three or four instances like this. The first was in 2014, when the country effectively split in two. There were two rival parliaments. There were two rival governments. But, effectively, it was launched by Khalifa Haftar on May 15th, 2014, when he launched a counterterrorism operation, which was effectively a thinly veiled attempt at a coup. He had already launched the coup two months before that, on February 14th, and had just rephrased it and kind of repackaged it, and it’s still kind of ongoing. He took into a foothold in Benghazi in eastern Libya, where he acquired territory through military support delivered from the UAE and France over the last couple of years, and has been moving swiftly across the country.
In February, he was allegedly going to cut a deal with this new U.N.-backed government, that only came into existence after a U.N.-negotiated dialogue over two-and-a-half years, between 2014 and '16, which was supposed to deliver a consensus government. Now, the prime minister of that government, Fayez Sarraj, is not of any of the two rival factions that began fighting in 2014. He's an MP from—a member of parliament that was elected in Tripoli in 2014 with around 3,000 votes, so, effectively, no skin in the game, but has become Haftar’s kind of punching bag over the last two years and was almost going to agree to a deal to allow Haftar to take control of the Libyan National Army, to acquire the international recognition that Fayez Sarraj and the U.N.-backed government actually have acquired from the U.N. over the last couple of years. and then that deal went wrong last month during a visit by António Guterres, the chief of the U.N., when Haftar launched an offensive in Tripoli two weeks ago. And since then, the fighting has been kind of catastrophic.
But to paint a very easy picture here, you have two kind of factions. You have those that believe in creating a civilian-backed government, a democratic one, a pluralist kind of nation, that kind of adhere to the ideals of the revolution, that many of Libyans came around in 2011 to support, and defend against the return of military rule. And you have Khalifa Haftar, that is trying to, at least in some way, recreate that rule that had gone on to Libya for 42 years, and is trying to bend the will of those that exist and live in the most densely populated part of Libya—2.7 million people live in western Libya, and, effectively, this offensive is launched against them. So, it’s been a very nasty couple of years, but this is just one chapter in a very, very long series of chapters in Libya’s civil war.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: Well, could you talk about the role of France? Because France is obviously—has been backing Haftar, along with the UAE , Egypt, Saudi Arabia. Why is France backing him?
ANAS EL GOMATI : I think, for many states, they have—I mean, let’s not go into altruism here, but many states have their own very narrow interests. I think, in terms of France’s, it’s consistent with a joint alliance that they’ve launched with the UAE , with Egypt, with Saudi Arabia—so, MBS , effectively, MBZ , Mohammed bin Zayed in the UAE , and President Sisi, this new kind of—this new club of autocrats that have emerged since the Arab Spring over the last couple of years. They’ve aligned themselves to those autocrats for a variety of reasons. I mean, in terms of commercial interests in Libya, France tends to benefit through its relationship with Total in trying to get concessions through Khalifa Haftar. The idea that you can negotiate with one man is often a much more simple relationship, or simpler relationship, than negotiating with an elected government that may change after a couple of years.
But it also comes down to a very—an ideological narrative, that has been—not only that has been propagated in Libya, but has been propogated throughout the Arab world by the UAE , which tries to paint all forms of political opposition, political dissidence, civil society participation, as Salafi jihadist, as terrorism. And that war on terrorism is really a thinly veiled attempt at returning the Arab world to autocratic rule and trying to maintain the status quo, create these kind of neopatrimonial relationships, where you have a client state, and you have very, very narrow interests, amongst a very narrow club of individuals, who can then go on to deliver your strategic interests through a click of a button, from distance, through proxy. So, I think, in that respect, France is part of a wider club. It’s part of a wider alliance. But it’s certainly one that has found footing over the last couple of years by reorientating a war-on-terror narrative that has been around since 2001, but giving it an Arab dialect, and one that really is just a thinly veiled attempt at returning the Arab world to autocratic rule.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And could you talk about the role of Erik Prince and his former mercenary organization, Blackwater, in Libya?
ANAS EL GOMATI : Well, it’s really the UAE’s role that is behind this. I think, in 2010, the UAE , Mohammed bin Zayed, gave over half a billion dollars to the Frontier Services Group, which is now led by Erik Prince, formerly of Blackwater. And since then, allegedly, according to Western print media, Erik Prince, alongside the UAE , established an air base, a military base, a drone base, in eastern Libya between 2014 and '16. Now, this is well documented by the U.N. Panel of Experts on the Security Council, where the year that Libya was supposed to be delivered an enduring peace, a sustainable peace, a concession by both sides in the civil war, in 2016, when they announced the beginning of this new chapter in Libya's history and delivered this Government of National Accord in Tripoli, was the very year that the UAE violated the arms embargo in Libya in unprecedented levels but also began to establish the final touches and final pieces of this air base in eastern Libya called al-Khadim. Now, it possesses a massive arsenal of drones, Wing Loongs, which are Chinese kind of mimics of the American Predator F1 drone, but it also houses at least two Air Tractors, which are kind of industrial—industrial kind of aircraft that have been kitted out with air-to-surface missiles. And at the very least, this kind of move—I mean, it’s very, very difficult to pin down, so that’s why I’m using the word “alleged,” because I don’t want to get sued. But at the very least, there have been many, many investigations that have pinned this to Erik Prince’s Frontier Services Group.
At least in the last two years, that arsenal of drones and Air Tractors have been used to support Khalifa Haftar’s ground offensives in Benghazi and in Derna, that have displaced around 100,000 people in Benghazi but have also led to 1,700 people being imprisoned in Derna. And many of those ground invasions, many of those military assaults, are now being investigated by the ICC for war crimes. So, I think it’s that kind of tacit and underlying kind of discreet military assistance that the UAE provided, that the French provided in Benghazi, that has not only bolstered Khalifa Haftar in the east of the country but has been the platform and the pretext for this latest offensive in Tripoli.
And we should remind ourselves that this was done in the eyes and in the presence of António Guterres, the chief of the U.N. And it wasn’t a mistake. It wasn’t anything that was down to kind of an absence of timing. It was timed to coincide with his trip. And it was timed to alert, by Khalifa Haftar, his political and military opponents and much of the population, that is dissatisfied and does not want to return to military rule, to indicate to them that he is immune from diplomatic pressure, from condemnation, from sanction. The U.N., over the last two weeks, has been fumbling a security resolution, that the language seems to suggest that they cannot condemn Haftar, they cannot pressure Haftar, they can’t sanction him, when only seven months ago they sanctioned a small group from central Libya that went into Tripoli in September, and within 72 hours that group and that individual, Salah Badi, was put on a sanctions list. Two weeks since Khalifa Haftar’s offensive, that has now resulted in at least 20,000 people that have been displaced, with the use of Grad missiles, which go against the Geneva Conventions and that have struck in densely populated civilian areas, the U.N. is still unable to mention him by name in any of their statements. And I think that is the real danger here, that he enjoys this kind of diplomatic immunity, from states that, on the surface, seem to suggest they support the U.N.-backed administration in Tripoli, but, underneath, have been providing discreet military and political support to Khalifa Haftar, and now want to enjoy and immunize him from any kind of sanction.
AMY GOODMAN : Anas, can you explain who Khalifa Haftar is, a Libyan American?
ANAS EL GOMATI : Yeah. So, I mean, we have to go back to 1969. I mean, he has a 50-year legacy of deception and defection. In 1969, he defected from the king of Libya to Muammar Gaddafi in the coup of 1st of September, 1969. He then defected again during the battle against Chad in 1986 to Hissène Habré. He defected and went to Langley, Virginia, where he was alleged to have been working with the CIA for at least 20 years, and in the meantime joined the Libyan opposition, led by Mohammed Magariaf, in 1987. He defected from him and joined another Libyan opposition in 1992, led by Breik Swessi, who was the former Libyan ambassador to the Netherlands. He then defected from him and went back to Gaddafi and reconciled in Cairo in 2004, but then again reneged on that and defected from Gaddafi in 2011 to join the revolution, which he didn’t last very long in. He actually bombed the first elected parliament that came from the revolution in 2014, launched two coups in the space of three months in 2014. And in the latest deal that has been negotiated by the U.N. over two years, since the first meeting between Khalifa Haftar and the U.N.-backed prime minister in Abu Dhabi in May 2016, again in Paris in 2017, we were working towards a political solution. He reneged on that last deal in front of the U.N. chief.
So, effectively, this is the most distrustful, untrustworthy character in the last 50 years in Libya’s political history. He’s like Pinocchio, but with more strings. I mean, he literally has more strings than you can count, from at least seven states over the last 50 years. And my belief at the moment is that many people in Libya are now asking themselves: How do you bring someone like this, with that kind of checkered history, to a negotiation table and expect him to agree to anything and to expect him to kind of live up to his expectations?
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: But if that’s true of his long and checkered history, why has the opposition in Tripoli been so unable to amass sufficient support to defeat him? Could you talk about the problems within the so-called U.N.-sanctioned coalition government in Tripoli?
ANAS EL GOMATI : So, the U.N.-backed government is effectively a civilian-appointed government by the U.N. It was designed to not represent any of Haftar’s opponents. They only came into opposition to him around a few weeks ago, when he launched this offensive against them—and in the words of Prime Minister Fayez Sarraj, he said, “I feel stabbed in the back,” the two days after the offensive was launched—many of whom have now—you know, had thought that he might have been a stabilizing factor but had engaged in good faith. But the groups, the armed groups on the ground, that have emerged since 2011, are pluralistic. And I think, in one respect, Khalifa Haftar has tried to paint them as Islamists, as Salafi jihadist sympathizers. But that is just a dog whistle to the far right, to the emergence of populists in Europe, in the West, that want to view the region in those terms, in black-and-white terms, to oversimplify, and dangerously do so.
But those groups that emerged in 2011, over a wide variety of different political trends and different political beliefs, but what coalesces them, what unifies them, this conceptual thread, is that many of them, for a grievance and for other reasons over the last 42 years, do not want to return to military rule. Many of them are bound by a few things like the ideals of the revolution, the idea of social justice, accountability, pluralism. And many of them don’t agree. Many of them, in fact—many of them, in fact, have actually been working to try to mask and use that grievance to mask their greed and to acquire financial interests and to try to acquire public rent-seeking behavior. But the underneath, the underlying truth in all this, is that so many of those armed groups came into existence as extensions of their own tribes, their own cities, their own communities, that had suffered under military rule and despise Gaddafi, but in a very simple sense. A lot of them didn’t support the GNA . They might not have been ready to fight for the GNA , for the Government of National Accord, the U.N.-backed government, but they’d be willing to fight and die against Khalifa Haftar in an attempt to stop the return of military rule.
AMY GOODMAN : Anas, we want to thank you for being with us. Anas El Gomati, director of the Tripoli-based Sadeq Institute, Libya’s first independent research organization—
ANAS EL GOMATI : Thank you.
AMY GOODMAN : —speaking to us from London. When we come back in 30 seconds, the ICC is saying they won’t go after those investigating the United States’ involvement in war crimes in Afghanistan.

In Egypt, lawmakers approved new constitutional amendments Tuesday that would allow President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi to remain in power until 2030. He is currently scheduled to leave the post in 2022, at the end of his second and current term. The amendments will now be put to a referendum. Critics warn that the changes will only increase Sisi and the military’s authoritarian reach. Sisi’s crackdown on dissent has led to the detention of tens of thousands of people since he came into power in 2014. Last year, Human Rights Watch reported that around 15,000 civilians, including hundreds of children, have been referred to military prosecutors.

The Case Against Joe Biden: How the Former VP Fueled Mass Incarceration & Protected Big Banks | Democracy Now!,www.democracynow.org,,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://www.democracynow.org/2019/3/14/the_case_against_joe_biden_how,"Washington editor for Harper’s magazine. Transcript This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.
AMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report . I’m Amy Goodman, with Part 2 of our discussion about speculation mounting that former Vice President Joe Biden will soon enter the race for the Democratic presidential nomination. A longtime senator from Delaware, Biden has previously run twice for the Democratic nomination, last time in 2008, when he ultimately became then-Senator Barack Obama’s running mate.
While a new campaign would seek to capitalize on Biden’s two terms as vice president, it would also invite scrutiny of his Senate record, in a Democratic political climate that’s notably more progressive today than it was when Biden last sought the nomination. Joe Biden’s 1994 crime bill, while implementing sweeping gun control, also helped fuel mass incarceration with financial incentives to keep people behind bars. This is Joe Biden, Senator Joe Biden, speaking in 1993 during the debate on the Senate crime bill. The clip was recently unearthed by CNN .
SEN . JOE BIDEN : We must take back the streets. It doesn’t matter whether or not the person that is accosting your son or daughter or my son or daughter, my wife, your husband, my mother, your parents—it doesn’t matter whether or not they were deprived as a youth. It doesn’t matter or not—whether or not they had background that enabled them to have—to become social—become socialized into the fabric of society. It doesn’t matter whether or not they’re the victims of society. The end result is they’re about to knock my mother on the head with a lead pipe, shoot my sister, beat up my wife, take on my sons. So I don’t want to ask what made them do this. They must be taken off the street.
AMY GOODMAN : Senator Biden went on to describe criminals as predators.
SEN . JOE BIDEN : If we don’t, they will, or a portion of them will, become the predators, 15 years from now. And, Madam President, we have predators on our streets, that society has, in fact, in part because of its neglect, created.
AMY GOODMAN : Joe Biden is also known for close ties to the financial industry, notably helping push through a 2005 bill that made it harder for consumers to declare bankruptcy. According to The New York Times , the credit card issuer MBNA was Biden’s top donor from 1989 to 2010. One of his key legislative achievements was the 2005 bankruptcy law that made it harder to reduce student debt, preventing most Americans from claiming bankruptcy protections for private student loans.
Well, to continue our conversation on Joe Biden and his possible presidential run, we go to Washington, D.C., to talk with Washington editor for Harper’s magazine Andrew Cockburn, his latest piece for Harper’s headlined “No Joe! Joe Biden’s disastrous legislative legacy.”
Thank you for staying for Part 2 of this conversation, Andrew.
ANDREW COCKBURN : Not at all.
AMY GOODMAN : So, let’s talk more deeply about the crime bill and Senator Joe Biden’s involvement in that and where you see his trajectory today.
ANDREW COCKBURN : Well, I mean, it was his signature issue, really throughout the 1980s. As I mentioned earlier, you know, he teamed up with Strom Thurmond, this sort of very aged, old segregationist from South Carolina, you know, really the face of—the face of everything that we’d been trying to get away from. And it was really, you know, Joe—he thought this was going to really propel him to the top. As he said to a former aide, who told me—I think it was around about 1990—the aide was telling me how he, Joe, was always trying to hold hearings on crime and drugs. Every week, his poor staff had to sit around dreaming up a new excuse for a hearing on crime and drugs. And as Biden said to his staffer, he said, “I want when people hear the words 'crime' and 'drugs,' I want them to think 'Joe Biden.'” I mean, he was really running, you know, like a—like George Bush Sr., on a sort of Willie Horton. You know, it’s astonishing that this man, this politician, should be considered a front-runner for the Democrats.
AMY GOODMAN : Now, could he simply say he’s changed since then, that he’s completely reversed his position?
ANDREW COCKBURN : Well, not really. I mean, he sort of—he’s flubbed on a few things. I mean, he changed—you know, he’s apologized for a few things—not, I note, on busing; not on choice, where his record is truly terrible. He has said that he’s kind of sorry, a bit sorry, about his crime legislation. And he said he’s sorry he voted for the financial deregulation, the key repeal of Glass-Steagall. He said that was the worst vote ever—ever of his entire career, which I’m—there’s a lot of competition there. So, but even if—you know, just thinking of his political viability, supposing he has to go through the campaign saying, “Well, I’m sorry I did what I did on busing. I’m sorry I did what I did on crime. I’m sorry I did what I did on banks,” he’s going to sound like another shifty politician.
AMY GOODMAN : And on Anita Hill, “I’m sorry what I did on Anita Hill”?
ANDREW COCKBURN : And Anita Hill, “I’m really sorry about Anita Hill.” He’s expressed some regret for that, I should admit. So, you know, basically, his record has very little that’s good about it. You know, he has his sort of shtick of being the friend of the working man, but, you know, he’s been a much better and closer friend of the financial industry.
AMY GOODMAN : Talk about what happened with Neil Kinnock, the speech.
ANDREW COCKBURN : Well, very bizarre, that. He, Neil Kinnock, who at that time was the leader of the Labour Party, had this standard stump speech.
AMY GOODMAN : In Britain.
ANDREW COCKBURN : In Britain, yeah, British Labour Party. And he would—in his stump speech, he would say that, you know, he was—why was it that he was the first Kinnock in a thousand years to go to college, and Mrs. Kinnock, he invoked, too, as being the first from her family to go to college. And he made a moving sort of rags-to-riches sort of piece out of that. And Biden—Biden heard this, or his speechwriter did, and thought, “That sounds good,” and simply substituted the word “Biden”: “Why am I the first Biden in a thousand years to go to college?” and so on, so forth. And, well, what’s particularly ironic about it is that Neil Kinnock was known in Britain as the “Welsh windbag,” because he went on and on. And, of course, Biden himself is a terrible windbag. So, it was really bizarre to have one windbag plagiarizing another.
AMY GOODMAN : I wanted to talk about Iraq. In 2002, former chief U.N. weapons inspector in Iraq, Scott Ritter, said, quote, “Sen. Joe Biden is running a sham hearing. It is clear that Biden and most of the Congressional leadership have pre-ordained a conclusion that seeks to remove Saddam Hussein from power regardless of the facts, and are using these hearings to provide political cover for a massive military attack on Iraq. These hearings have nothing to do with an objective search for the truth, but rather seek to line up like-minded witnesses who will buttress this pre-determined result,” Ritter said. That same year, in 2002, Senator Biden said, quote, “We must be clear with the American people that we are committing to Iraq for the long haul; not just the day after, but the decade after. … I am absolutely confident the President will not take us to war alone,” he said. Talk about the significance of that then, and then what it could mean for today.
ANDREW COCKBURN : Well, it fits into Biden’s, you know, worldview, or, well, behavior on the international stage, throughout, which is as, you know, a very hard-line hawk. You know, as you just said, or as Ritter said at the time, Biden was really doing everything he could to assist George Bush in the run-up to the illegal invasion of Iraq. You know, on the Foreign Relations Committee, he summoned just pro-invasion witnesses. As far as I know, he was certainly not one of the famous of the five senators who took the trouble to go down and read the National Intelligence Estimate, that Senator Bob Graham has talked about, which was locked away down in the basement, which would have told them that there was a lot of doubts in the intelligence community as to whether Saddam had weapons of mass destruction and so forth. No, he just—he wanted—you know, he was all for war, and he was all for occupation, as you said.
And that fits in with, you know, his record since, most notably as vice president. Obama made him, made Vice President Biden—gave him really the—well, the Iraq file, but also the Ukraine file. And Biden used that to be an ardent proponent of, you know, more arms for Ukraine, for intervention in what is really a civil war in Ukraine. Of course, his family—his son—had very extensive business ties in Ukraine, which doesn’t look too good. His son Hunter was on the board of the Ukrainian gas company. So, you know, Biden, whenever he’s been given the chance, he’s been for armed intervention. He was ardently for the expansion of NATO , the post-1990—in the 1990s, which, you know, is really the root cause of the renewed—sort of the new Cold War. I mean, Biden was there. It’s no surprise that he describes John McCain as his best friend in the Senate.
AMY GOODMAN : Biden also said, in 2002, “I do not believe this is a rush to war; I believe it’s a march to peace and security.” So, Andrew Cockburn, if you could comment on his two runs for president, both failed? You know, all the media is saying the polls show he’s the—you know, number one now, followed by Bernie Sanders. But, of course, he’s got the biggest name recognition nationally. He was vice president for eight years under President Obama.
ANDREW COCKBURN : Well, that’s right. I mean, it is largely a factor of name recognition. But also, I mean, we have to think about those two runs. And what it showed—first of all, there was, as we’ve discussed, this astonishing gaffe in 1988, where he wasn’t just plagiarizing this British politician, by the way. It turned out that his speeches also had extensive passages lifted from Robert Kennedy, Bobby Kennedy, and Martin Luther King, unbelievably. So, you know, it’s kind of—it’s hard to explain this really sort of mental issue. But then that sank his—it’s not clear that his campaign was going anywhere, anyway, at that time.
And then, in 2008, you know, he didn’t even have that excuse of a plagiarism. I mean, he made an astonishing remark about Barack Obama early on, where he described him as “clean.” I mean, it was a very sort of racist—almost racist-sounding, patronizing remark. And he got nowhere. You know, he really sputtered in his campaign, sputtered and died.
So it’s pretty bizarre to me, this sort of—this cheering squad for Biden: you know, “Run, Joe! Run!” And I think, actually, what you—clip you showed, featured, of him at the firefighters’ convention yesterday, was very telling, because sounded like I can hear Donald Trump invoking, you know, low energy again. He didn’t sound like a, you know, ready-to-go politician at all to me. He sounded sort of rather weary. I have the feeling sometimes that he—in his heart, he doesn’t want to do it. That’s why we’ve had this sort of Hamlet performance for months now. And the people around him, all these longtime aides, this is their chance for, you know, a ticket in the big game, to be in on a big-time presidential campaign, and they’re kind of pushing him into it.
Maybe I’m wrong, but I think, you know, if he does run, those poll numbers will come down in a hurry. He’s not an effective campaigner. He hates preparation. He hates like debate prep. He’s not a great fundraiser. He doesn’t like having to sort of kowtow to big donors to get money. He’s got such an inflated ego. I really think that he is not—I’m not the only person saying this; people who’ve known him for a long time think the same—that he would really—what he really wants is to be anointed—you know, “Please, Mr. Biden, please come and be our candidate. Please come and be our president”—without having to go through the hard grind, the incredible exhaustion, of a modern presidential campaign.
AMY GOODMAN : Andrew, could you talk about the media’s coverage of him? You are really among the first, if not the first one, in this period, to start really seriously analyzing Joe Biden’s record as a senator and then as a vice president. Then the rest of the media started, well, repeating some of what you had to say.
ANDREW COCKBURN : Well, yes. So, thank you. That’s kind. But that is true. But, I mean, the pack—you know, now they’re all busy at work, like CNN digging out that very damning clip you played earlier. And there’s going to be a lot more of that. I mean, already there’s things I didn’t know that are coming up. And just imagine what it’s going to be like when he has 12 other Democrats, you know, sort of chasing him around the ring. It’s going to be like Lord of the Flies or something. It’s, you know, the people—you know, oppo researchers can be pretty good these days, and there’s a lot to come out.
And he has—you know, he has so many deficiencies as a candidate, including, I should say, because the Republicans are already saying it, a “me, too” problem. I mean, if you look on sort of Republican websites and Twitter accounts, there’s a montage going around of Joe Biden with women at photo ops, including some quite young women—children, really—you know, apparently fondling them. I’m sure it’s all very just avuncular and everything, but as one person, one political fundraiser and operative, said to me—a lady said, “I was never talking to him when he wasn’t stroking my back.” You know, he’s very tactile, which, I’m sure, is entirely innocent. But, you know, don’t think that the Republicans won’t make a lot of lot of hay with that, and probably his Democratic rivals, too.
AMY GOODMAN : And, of course, I mean, you start with Anita Hill. He was head of the Senate Judiciary Committee when—well, we mentioned it in Part 1 of our discussion, but talk about exactly the role he played as chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee for the Clarence Thomas confirmation, how he responded to Anita Hill first coming forward.
ANDREW COCKBURN : Well, very reluctantly. He didn’t really want to put her on. He was obviously just uncomfortable with the whole thing. I mean, he assured—you know, it’s a telling remark, because he—just before the hearings or at the beginning of the hearings, he was walking, I believe it was, Clarence Thomas’s mother into the hearings. And he said was the effect of “Don’t worry, Mrs. Thomas. You know, your son will be OK with us, or I’ll look after your son.”
You know, he fancies himself as a great sort of legal authority. And, you know, he—because he had done the Bork hearings, had gone quite well, from his point of view—Robert Bork, a previous Supreme Court nominee who the Democrats had managed to—you know, the Senate had rejected. And so, Biden, really, his view of himself as a sort of, you know, a great legal scholar was really inflated, so he fancied himself as having sort of serious legal discussions with Clarence Thomas.
And the fact that this woman, this black woman, was coming forward with some very—actually, very convincing stories of the true nature of Clarence Thomas was obviously unsettling to him. And then he panicked, because the Republicans mounted a very, you know, adroit and forceful pushback campaign against poor Anita Hill. And so, when there was—you know, he was offered two more witnesses who would back up what she was saying. He panicked and just wanted to close the whole thing down as quickly as possible before the Republicans broadcast more rude remarks about him.
AMY GOODMAN : I want to go to a clip of Anita Hill. Let’s turn to then-Senator Joe Biden, Senate Judiciary Committee chair, questioning Anita Hill in 1991.
SEN . JOE BIDEN : Can you tell the committee what was the most embarrassing of all the incidences that you have alleged?
ANITA HILL : I think the one that was the most embarrassing was his discussion of pornography involving these women with large breasts and engaged in a variety of sex with different people or animals. That was the thing that embarrassed me the most and made me feel the most humiliated.
AMY GOODMAN : That was Anita Hill being questioned by Senate Judiciary Chair Joe Biden back in 1991. In an interview with Elle magazine last year, Anita Hill noted Biden acknowledged he owed her an apology, but he never took the next step. Andrew?
ANDREW COCKBURN : Well, there you go. I mean, he said he owed her an apology but didn’t deliver. I mean, this is fitting. This fits in with Biden’s sort of general behavior. He doesn’t like admitting he was wrong. He doesn’t like—you know, he doesn’t like anything that sort of interferes with his self-image, which is, you know, strangely enough, that of a fearless fighter for the working man, despite his record; as a champion of civil rights. You know, as he said at Strom Thurmond’s funeral, where he gave the eulogy, he said, you know, “I was in—got into politics impassioned about the fate of black people and, you know, a champion of civil rights.” He really—I think he tells himself that. But it’s not true. And so, that, you know, he hasn’t even had the grace to call up Anita Hill and say, “Look, I’m really, really sorry for what happened to you,” is very telling.
AMY GOODMAN : Andrew, we just—we have less than two minutes. But he already ran for president twice. What happened then, in 1988 and in 2008?
ANDREW COCKBURN : What happened, I mean, he ran for president twice and failed miserably both times. I mean, he was—it’s really astonishing that he’s considered a serious candidate at the moment, because, you know, his record in national electoral politics is abysmal. I mean, he was rescued by Obama in 2008, who wanted a sort of older white—sort of white elder statesman to balance his ticket. But, you know, I know—I do know that he drove the Obama team crazy, you know, trying to get him to stay on message, trying to get him to stick to the point, not to ramble on. He was terrible in debate prep. And, you know, his aides had to keep—to keep him focused, they kept saying to him, “Listen, just think three words: Air Force Two,” to get him to sort of toe the line, do what the Obama managers, who were pretty good at their job, were telling him to do and not sort of ramble off.
AMY GOODMAN : Well, Andrew Cockburn, I want to thank you for being with us, Washington editor for Harper’s magazine, his latest piece for Harper’s headlined “No Joe! Joe Biden’s disastrous legislative legacy.” We’ll link to it at democracynow.org.

In more immigration news, the Trump administration is resuming its so-called Remain in Mexico policy, after an appeals court stayed a lower court ruling that had blocked the controversial practice. The policy forces asylum seekers to wait in Mexico while their cases make their way through U.S. courts, which legal experts and rights groups say is illegal. Over 1,100 migrants who entered the country via the southern border have been sent back to Mexico to wait out their court cases since the policy started. Topics:"

AMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! I’m Amy Goodman, with Nermeen Shaikh. We end today’s show with the world-renowned linguist, political dissident Noam Chomsky. I spoke to him last week at the Old South Church in Boston. In a moment, we’ll hear Noam Chomsky talk about Russian meddling in the 2016 election and what the Mueller report found and didn’t find, which is being released today. But first, I asked Noam Chomsky to talk about the Green New Deal and the lessons of the old New Deal.
NOAM CHOMSKY : First of all, I think the Green New Deal is exactly the right idea. You can raise questions about the specific form in which Ocasio-Cortez and Markey introduced it: Maybe it shouldn’t be exactly this way; it should be a little bit differently. But the general idea is quite right. And there’s very solid work explaining, developing in detail, exactly how it could work. So, a very fine economist at UMass Amherst, Robert Pollin, has written extensively on, in extensive detail, with close analysis of how you could implement policies of this kind in a very effective way, which would actually make a better society. It wouldn’t be that you’d lose from it; you’d gain from it. The costs of renewable energy are declining very sharply. If you eliminate the massive subsidies that are given to fossil fuels, they probably already surpass them. There are many means that can be implemented and carried out to overcome, certainly to mitigate, maybe to overcome, this serious crisis. So the basic idea is, I think, completely defensible—in fact, essential. A lot of the media commentary ridiculing this and that aspect of it are essentially beside the point. You can change the dates from 2030 to 2040, you can do a couple of other manipulations, but the basic idea is correct.
Well, what’s the difference from the 1930s? Several things. One thing that’s different is large-scale labor action. The 1930s were the period of the organization of the CIO . In the 1920s, the U.S. labor movement had been virtually destroyed. Remember, this is very much a business-run society. American labor history is very violent, quite unlike comparable countries. And by the 1920s, the quite effective, militant labor movement had been pretty much crushed. One of the great works of labor history, by David Montgomery, one of the great labor historians, is called The Rise and Fall of the American Labor Movement [ The Fall of the House of Labor: The Workplace, the State, and American Labor Activism, 1865-1925 ]. He was talking about the 1920s, when it had essentially been destroyed. The 1930s, it revived. It revived with large-scale organizing activities. The CIO organizing began. The strike actions were quite militant. They led to sitdown strikes. A sitdown strike is a real sign of warning to the business classes, because there’s a step beyond a sitdown strike. The next step beyond a sitdown strike is: “Let’s start the factory by running it by ourselves. We don’t need the bosses. We can run it ourselves. So, get rid of them.” OK? That’s a real revolution, the kind that should take place. The participants in an enterprise would own and run it by themselves, instead of being the slaves of the private owners who control their lives. And a sitdown strike is a bare step away from that. That aroused real fear among the ownership classes.
Second element was there was a sympathetic administration, which is very critical. You look at the history of labor actions over the centuries—there’s a very good book on this, incidentally, by Erik Loomis, who studies—has a book called American History in Ten Strikes , or some similar name [ A History of America in Ten Strikes ], where he runs through the militant labor actions ever since the early 19th century. And he makes an interesting point. He says every successful labor action has had at least tacit support of the government. If the government and the ownership classes are unified in crushing labor action, they’ve always succeeded. OK? Very significant observation. And in the 1930s, there was a sympathetic administration, for many reasons. But that combination of militant labor action—it was a very lively political period in many ways—and a sympathetic administration did lead to the New Deal, which greatly changed people’s lives.

"Chomsky: By Focusing on Russia, Democrats Handed Trump a ""Huge Gift"" & Possibly the 2020 Election",www.democracynow.org,mail@democracynow.org (Democracy Now!),04-18-2019,2019,4,https://www.democracynow.org/2019/4/18/chomsky_by_focusing_on_russia_democrats,"world-renowned political dissident, linguist and author.

AMY GOODMAN : Can you share your analysis of President Trump? You have lived through so many presidents. Explain President Trump to us and assess the massive response to him.
NOAM CHOMSKY : Well, Trump is—you know, I think there are a number of illusions about Trump. If you take a look at the Trump phenomenon, it’s not very surprising. Think back for the last 10 or 15 years over Republican Party primaries, and remember what happened during the primaries. Each primary, when some candidate rose from the base, they were so outlandish that the Republican establishment tried to crush them and succeeded in doing it—Michele Bachmann, Herman Cain, Rick Santorum. Anyone who was coming out of the base was totally unacceptable to the establishment. The change in 2016 is they couldn’t crush him.
But the interesting question is: Why was this happening? Why, in election after election, was the voting base producing a candidate utterly intolerable to the establishment? And the answer to that is—if you think about that, the answer is not very hard to discover. During the—since the 1970s, during this neoliberal period, both of the political parties have shifted to the right. The Democrats, by the 1970s, had pretty much abandoned the working class. I mean, the last gasp of more or less progressive Democratic Party legislative proposals was the Humphrey-Hawkins Full Employment Act in 1978, which Carter watered down so that it had no teeth, just became voluntary. But the Democrats had pretty much abandoned the working class. They became pretty much what used to be called moderate Republicans. Meanwhile, the Republicans shifted so far to the right that they went completely off the spectrum. Two of the leading political analysts of the American Enterprise Institute, Thomas Mann, Norman Ornstein, about five or 10 years ago, described the Republican Party as what they called a “radical insurgency” that has abandoned parliamentary politics.
Well, why did that happen? It happened because the Republicans face a difficult problem. They have a primary constituency, a real constituency: extreme wealth and corporate power. That’s who they have to serve. That’s their constituency. You can’t get votes that way, so you have to do something else to get votes. What do you do to get votes? This was begun by Richard Nixon with the Southern strategy: try to pick up racists in the South. The mid-1970s, Paul Weyrich, one of the Republican strategists, hit on a brilliant idea. Northern Catholics voted Democratic, tended to vote Democratic, a lot of them working-class. The Republicans could pick up that vote by pretending—crucially, “pretending”—to be opposed to abortion. By the same pretense, they could pick up the evangelical vote. Those are big votes—evangelicals, northern Catholics. Notice the word “pretense.” It’s crucial. You go back to the 1960s, every leading Republican figure was strongly, what we call now, pro-choice. The Republican Party position was—that’s Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, all the leadership—their position was: Abortion is not the government’s business; it’s private business—government has nothing to say about it. They turned almost on a dime in order to try to pick up a voting base on what are called cultural issues. Same with gun rights. Gun rights become a matter of holy writ because you can pick up part of the population that way. In fact, what they’ve done is put together a coalition of voters based on issues that are basically, you know, tolerable to the establishment, but they don’t like it. OK? And they’ve got to hold that, those two constituencies, together. The real constituency of wealth and corporate power, they’re taken care of by the actual legislation.
So, if you look at the legislation under Trump, it’s just lavish gifts to the wealth and the corporate sector—the tax bill, the deregulation, you know, every case in point. That’s kind of the job of Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan, those guys. They serve the real constituency. Meanwhile, Trump has to maintain the voting constituency, with one outrageous position after another that appeals to some sector of the voting base. And he’s doing it very skillfully. As just as a political manipulation, it’s skillful. Work for the rich and the powerful, shaft everybody else, but get their votes—that’s not an easy trick. And he’s carrying it off.
And, I should say, the Democrats are helping him. They are. Take the focus on Russiagate. What’s that all about? I mean, it was pretty obvious at the beginning that you’re not going to find anything very serious about Russian interference in elections. I mean, for one thing, it’s undetectable. I mean, in the 2016 election, the Senate and the House went the same way as the executive, but nobody claims there was Russian interference there. In fact, you know, Russian interference in the election, if it existed, was very slight, much less, say, than interference by, say, Israel. Israel, the prime minister, Netanyahu, goes to Congress and talks to a joint session of Congress, without even informing the White House, to attack Obama’s policies. I mean, that’s dramatic interference with elections. Whatever the Russians tried, it’s not going to be anything like that. And, in fact, there’s no interference in elections that begins to compare with campaign funding. Remember that campaign funding alone gives you a very high prediction of electoral outcome. It’s, again, Tom Ferguson’s major work which has shown this very persuasively. That’s massive interference in elections. Anything the Russians might have done is going to be, you know, peanuts in comparison. As far as Trump collusion with the Russians, that was never going to amount to anything more than minor corruption, maybe building a Trump hotel in Red Square or something like that, but nothing of any significance.
The Democrats invested everything in this issue. Well, turned out there was nothing much there. They gave Trump a huge gift. In fact, they may have handed him the next election. That’s just a—that’s a matter of being so unwilling to deal with fundamental issues, that they’re looking for something on the side that will somehow give political success. The real issues are different things. They’re things like climate change, like global warming, like the Nuclear Posture Review, deregulation. These are real issues. But the Democrats aren’t going after those. They’re looking for something else—the Democratic establishment. I’m not talking about the young cohort that’s coming in, which is quite different. Just all of that has to be shifted significantly, if there’s going to be a legitimate political opposition to the right-wing drift that’s taking place. And it can happen, can definitely happen, but it’s going to take work.

AMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! I’m Amy Goodman, with Nermeen Shaikh.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : “We can be whatever we have the courage to see.” That’s the message of a stunning new video released by The Intercept , Naomi Klein and award-winning artist Molly Crabapple Wednesday that imagines a future shaped by the Green New Deal. It’s called A Message from the Future with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez .
AMY GOODMAN : The film was co-written by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez herself, along with Avi Lewis, the co-founder of The Leap. He joins us now from Rutgers University, along with award-winning artist Molly Crabapple, who’s here in our New York studio.
We welcome you both to Democracy Now! The film now has been seen, since you released it on The Intercept yesterday, by millions of people, Molly. It’s a magnificent piece. Explain, especially for both our radio audience, who doesn’t see the images, but here’s Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez speaking in this fantastical piece that’s looking back at when she introduced the Green New Deal decades before.
MOLLY CRABAPPLE : We wanted to create something that fought against this tendency towards dystopia, towards this tendency to the apocalypse. Me and Naomi and Avi and Kim and Jim and Alexandria, we wanted to create a vision of a hopeful, beautiful future, of a future that we wanted to live in. So we made this animation with the idea that Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was rolling into Washington on the new train at some point in the future and thinking back to how she had gotten there, thinking back to how a series of climate disasters, including Puerto Rico, led to the Green New Deal being adopted, and led to the country being made a better, more beautiful, a more kind and more dignified place.
AMY GOODMAN : Puerto Rico, where your father is from.
MOLLY CRABAPPLE : Yes, my father is from Puerto Rico. I think one of the reasons that this project was so meaningful to me was because both me and Alexandria, and probably over a million other New Yorkers, we saw what climate change looks like in real life. We saw that it wasn’t just like some theory, something, you know, far off that might happen in 20 years or 100 years. No, we saw climate change tear through Puerto Rico and kill 2,000 Americans. And I think probably my favorite piece, the piece that was most moving to me to draw, was this image of a house, like a pink, you know, very typical like casita in the mountains, that had been decimated by Maria, but the defiant Puerto Rican flag still there.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : Yeah, and, in fact, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s family is also from Puerto Rico, like your father is. And she refers—in the narration, she refers to what happened in Puerto Rico, Hurricane Maria, as a “climate bomb.” So, can you talk about the significance, for you, as for her, of making this, as you say, extremely moving visualization of what occurred?
MOLLY CRABAPPLE : I think a lot of people, when they look at the magnitude of changes that have to be made to properly fight against climate change, they’re like, “Oh my god, that’s too big. That’s too extreme.” But for me, and I think for Alexandria and for many other people who saw what happened in Puerto Rico, the other option is unimaginable. The other option is just submitting to having hurricanes periodically kill grandparents or having wildfires periodically burn down houses forever. I think that it was very, very important to us to communicate the urgency.
But the other thing that Puerto Rico taught me after Maria was the incredible resilience of people, the way that people who had been completely not just neglected, but spat upon, by the federal government and by FEMA , joined together and created mutual aid centers that cleared the roads, that fed their neighbors, that kept old people alive. And so, when me and Kim and Jim and Alexandria and Avi and Naomi were conceiving of this, we didn’t just want to capture, you know, the bad parts, the horrible things; we wanted to capture the idea that, yes, we can do great things. We can be resilient. We can come together.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : And talk about how illustrations, your art, can convey what, you know, perhaps script cannot. Because your art is just incredible, and what you’re able to represent, both in terms of what’s occurring now and a possible future, is very different from what people have ever seen.
MOLLY CRABAPPLE : I often think that we live in this incredibly image-saturated moment, where there’s this almost jadedness to photography. I think more photos are taken each year than they were in the entire first hundred years of the history of photography. But drawing, because it’s so personal, it can short-circuit that jadedness. It can get around that numbness.
What we did with this Message from the Future was, we both showed, in kind of like a symbolic way, what the past of climate change had looked like, what the research had been, what the present was, but we also were able to show, in this very, very concrete way, what the future would look like. One of my favorite things to draw for it was, I did a picture of Grand Army Concourse as it would be in 2028 under the Green New Deal. And it kept all of the beautiful old things. I don’t want our future to look like Dubai; I don’t want our future to mean that we get rid of our history and our culture. But it showed them surrounded with the new things, like solar and with like bullet trains and like rooftops that had been converted into community gardens. So, you have, you know, the abuelos on the block—right?—playing dominoes—low-carbon—but you also have people doing gardening on rooftops.
AMY GOODMAN : Avi Lewis, you’re speaking to us from Rutgers University. You worked with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on the script. Talk about that and how this fits into—we just heard Naomi Klein introducing the film and talking about the actual New Deal and the money that was put into artists. In a moment, we’re going to hear Noam Chomsky talk about what the Green New Deal can learn from the New Deal. Your comments?
AVI LEWIS : Well, first of all, Amy, it’s so great to be on Democracy Now! , as always, and to share this work of—it took about four months and a huge effort. I checked the numbers this morning, and it’s been seen by more than 4 million people in less than 24 hours. So it’s clearly striking a deep, deep nerve with people. And the number of responses we’ve heard and received about people who are, you know, kind of weeping while watching this visual imagining of a more hopeful future, I think, is really striking.
But, listen, as a storyteller and a film and television maker for almost 30 years, I’ve learned that there’s always a huge community of people making a work, most of whom are unseen. In this case, I feel like we should have had like a producer credit for the movements that produced this political moment that this piece is emerging from, decades of environmental justice work and organizing, particularly in communities that have historically and are currently excluded, organizations and networks like the Climate Justice Alliance, but also the Bernie campaign of 2016, that unleashed Big Organizing and the Justice Democrats and the Brand New Congress and, of course, the extraordinary Sunrise Movement. All of this building of movements on movements created this political moment from which this work of utopian fiction could emerge to strike the imagination of people.
Art accesses a different part of us. And I think, you know, even watching headlines this morning, the fight-or-flight panic that is evidenced in Greta’s unleashing of the climate strike movement among young people, the Extinction Rebellion folks—we are living in terrifying times. And for those of us who are committed to vast and rapid change, we’re living in a state of engagement that is, you know, not fun a lot of the time. And when I see people’s responses to this work, and the amount of emotion that it’s unleashed, I’m really struck by how much we need not just hope—which, as Obama and politicians like Justin Trudeau reveal, can be a shallow and easily leveraged commodity—but an actual vision, and when we have beautiful art like Molly’s, a fully articulated, beautiful vision of the world we’re fighting for. We need it. It orients us. It reminds us what we’re doing all this work for. And it unleashes incredible political potential, as well. I mean, this piece has struck a nerve for a very clear reason.
And, you know, getting to work with AOC was an extraordinary opportunity, you know, having my phone ring at a certain point weeks into the process, when I was waiting and waiting for reaction to the first draft of the script and having the little video call icon flash and then suddenly be talking to her in her office in Congress, and, you know, having a major restructuring of the first draft, and then I go out, in subsequent weeks, two full line edits, where she had sat down with the script and done a very intensive rewrite and then a very collaborative process in recording the narration, where I think we heard a different side of this remarkable, electrifying politician than we’ve heard, a more internal, a more dreamlike state, that she was able to locate in conjunction with the art and the ideas. I think we’re living in an extraordinary moment, full of peril and promise. And we need this promise nerve to be touched.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : And, Molly Crabapple, this work that you’ve done for The Intercept on climate change follows on another remarkable film that you illustrated on the war on drugs with Jay-Z. So, can you talk about how that was received, and how you hope—what you hope audiences will learn from this film?
MOLLY CRABAPPLE : Well, I’ve been lucky enough to spend about nine years creating films like these with Kim Boekbinder and Jim Batt. They’re stop-motion films that take sometimes 30 hours to film and then a hundred more hours to edit. And in—was it 2015, that—or 2016, that our collaboration with dream hampton and Jay-Z came out, which was about the disparities in the way that black people and white people are treated around drugs. It trended worldwide. It was something that teachers use, that’s used in museums, that I think was part of actually changing how people spoke about these sentencing disparities and how people spoke about creating not just marijuana legalization, but justice for all these people that have been, like, locked up in cages because of racist laws. I think our video did a small part of that.
And the thing that I think that these videos can do that’s very important is that many people, they look at a bunch of graphs, tables, data, long blocks of text, and they’re like, “This is so depressing. This is so overwhelming.” And they just basically stop reading after the headline. Whereas I think what the video does, and when you’re watching my hand draw out this past and future, is it pulls people along, and it makes them listen.
AMY GOODMAN : And the role of art in politics, that idea of what you’ve been doing all of this time?
MOLLY CRABAPPLE : I think that for too long art has been segregated from the rest of the world. It’s been locked up in museums the way that you lock up a butterfly in a glass cage, the way that you lock up a dead thing that’s no longer relevant. And I think that that is terrible that art has been cut off from life. Art needs to be—needs to be in the streets. It needs to be in people’s minds. The art world is too small of a place for art. And for me, doing work that’s, you know, graffitied on walls or that’s held at protests or that chronicles some of the struggles and conflicts of our time, that’s part of breaking art out of the cage of the art world.
AMY GOODMAN : Well, Molly Crabapple, we thank you for doing just that. Molly Crabapple, award-winning artist and writer. Avi Lewis, thanks for joining us from Rutgers University, co-writer and co-producer of The Intercept ’s animated film, A Message from the Future with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez , presented by The Intercept and Naomi Klein.

NERMEEN SHAIKH : The push for the Green New Deal continues to build momentum in the United States. Backers of the bill are launching a nationwide tour tonight to build support for the congressional resolution, which seeks to transform the U.S. economy through funding renewable energy while ending U.S. carbon dioxide emissions by 2030. Two Massachusetts lawmakers, Democratic Senator Ed Markey and Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley, are launching the Green New Deal tour at an event tonight in Boston. Meanwhile, the online news outlet The Intercept has just unveiled a short illustrated video featuring Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the New York congressmember who introduced the Green New Deal in the House.
AMY GOODMAN : It’s titled A Message from the Future with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez . It’s set decades in the future as Ocasio-Cortez looks back at the Green New Deal’s impact on the country. It features stunning artwork by award-winning illustrator Molly Crabapple. We’ll play the video in a moment, but first we turn to Intercept senior correspondent Naomi Klein, who helped make the film. She’s the author of many books, including This Changes Everything: Capitalism vs. the Climate . At an event celebrating the fifth anniversary of The Intercept Tuesday night, Naomi Klein discussed the making of the video.
NAOMI KLEIN : In December, the debate about the Green New Deal was starting to heat up, and it was starting to get ugly. And as you all know, for the past four months, it has been attacked by the serious center and the far right and the absolutely unhinged right, and here and there from the left, with some legitimate critiques.
But for those of us who really want the Green New Deal to succeed, want it to be the best that it possibly can be, see it as our—basically, our last hope for a livable planet, Molly and I were thinking about: How do we kind of do an end run around this misinformation campaign and produce some art and involve artists in the Green New Deal itself? And what Molly and I were talking about is that, first of all, art is low-carbon work. These are green jobs, you know? Green jobs aren’t just guys putting up solar panels. And when we think back to the original New Deal in the 1930s, one of the things that was really amazing about it was that it led to this renaissance of publicly funded art—hundreds of thousands of murals, all of these incredible films and theater pieces, and artists were treated as workers like any other.
The original New Deal was also under relentless attack by the press. There was actually a coup, you know, a sloppy coup, bankers’ coup, to try to overthrow FDR . The reason why it didn’t matter and the popularity still soared was, first of all, it was helping people, but also it had its own communication. And artists were out there, and they were all in for the Green New Deal.
And so, Molly said, “I would love to make a video with AOC .” And we started thinking about what that should communicate and what we should be trying to do. And what we realized was that the biggest problem we are up against, when we think about doing something as transformative as science demands, is the sense of futility that people have, because they’re told all the time that it’s impossible, that they’re just greedy, that they’re just going to spend their whole lives on the couch watching walruses commit suicide on Netflix and just, you know, let the whole thing wash over them. And it’s almost like people think that they don’t deserve to be saved.
And The Intercept had, just a few days earlier, published this really wonderful piece by Kate Aronoff, one of our fantastic reporters and writers, and who’s been a really important theorist for the Green New Deal. And Kate set this piece in the future, in the year 2045. And she told the story of a fictional young woman named Gina who lived in the world that the Green New Deal created. And it really struck a chord with readers of The Intercept . And we realized that it was because it was imagining a future that was actually nonapocalyptic, that did not take the apocalypse for granted, like almost every big-budget Hollywood film that we’ve ever seen, that just imagines the future as like Mad Max, you know, trying to protect your kids from cannibals and warlords, right? And so, that was what inspired this film. And I’m going to stop talking and let the film talk.
REP . ALEXANDRIA OCASIO - CORTEZ : Ah, the bullet train from New York to D.C. It always brings me back to when I first started making this commute. In 2019, I was a freshman in the most diverse Congress in history, up to that point. It was a critical time. I’ll never forget the children in our community. They were so inspired to see this new class of politicians who reflected them, navigating the halls of power. It’s often said, you can’t be what you can’t see. And for the first time, they saw themselves.
I think there was something similar with the Green New Deal. We knew that we needed to save the planet and that we had all the technology to do it, but people were scared. They said it was too big, too fast, not practical. I think that’s because they just couldn’t picture it yet.
Anyways, I’m getting ahead of myself. Let’s start with how we got here. 1977, New York, a senior scientist named James Black made a presentation about how burning fossil fuels could eventually lead to global temperatures rising 4 or 5 degrees Fahrenheit. Within two years, one of the world’s biggest supertankers was outfitted with a state-of-the-art lab to measure CO2 in the ocean, gathering more data about global warming. Guess who was doing all of this research: ExxonMobil, the oil and gas company. Oh, yeah, Exxon knew this whole time, as did our politicians.
Ten years later, James Hansen, NASA’s top climate scientist, told Congress he was 99% certain that global warming was happening and caused by humans. That was 1988, the year before I was even born.
So, did Exxon listen to the science, including their own? Did they change business models, invest in renewables? No, the opposite. They knew, and they doubled down. They and others spent millions setting up a network of lobby groups and think tanks to create doubt and denial about climate change. It was an effort designed to attack and dispute the very kind of science they themselves had been doing.
And it worked. Politicians went to bat for fossil fuels, and these massive corporations kept digging and mining, drilling and fracking, like there was no tomorrow. America became the biggest producer and consumer of oil in the world. Fossil fuel companies made hundreds of billions, while the public paid the lion’s share to clean up their disasters. We lost a generation of time we’ll never get back, entire species we’ll never get back, natural wonders gone forever.
And in 2017, Hurricane Maria destroyed the place where my family was from, Puerto Rico. It was like a climate bomb. It took as many American lives as 9/11.
And in the next year, when I was elected to Congress, the world’s leading climate scientists declared another emergency. They told us that we had 12 years left to cut our emissions in half, or hundreds of millions of people would be more likely to face food and water shortages, poverty and death. Twelve years to change everything—how we got around, how we fed ourselves, how we made our stuff, how we lived and worked—everything.
The only way to do it was to transform our economy, which we already knew was broken, since the vast majority of wealth was going to just a small handful of people, and most folks were falling further and further behind. It was a true turning point. Lots of people gave up. They said we were doomed. But some of us remembered that, as a nation, we had been in peril before: the Great Depression, World War II. We knew from our history how to pull together to overcome impossible odds. And at the very least, we owed it to our children to try.
The wave began when Democrats took back the House in 2018, and then the Senate and the White House in 2020, and launched the decade of the Green New Deal, a flurry of legislation that kicked off our social and ecological transformation to save the planet. It was the kind of swing-for-the-fence ambition we needed. Finally, we were entertaining solutions on the scale of the crises we faced, without leaving anyone behind. That included Medicare for all, the most popular social program in American history. We also introduced the federal jobs guarantee, a public option including dignified living wages for work. Funnily enough, the biggest problem in those early years was a labor shortage. We were building a national smart grid, retrofitting every building in America, putting trains like this one all across the country. We needed more workers.
That group of kids from my neighborhood were right in the middle of it all, especially this one girl, Ileana. Her first job out of college was with AmeriCorps Climate, restoring wetlands and bayous in coastal Louisiana. Most of her friends were in her union, including some oil workers in transition. They took apart old pipelines and got to work planting mangroves with the same salary and benefits. Of course, when it came to healing the land, we had huge gaps in our knowledge. Luckily, indigenous communities offered generational expertise to help guide the way. Ileana got restless, tried her hand as a solar plant engineer for a while but eventually made her career in raising the next generation as part of the universal child care initiative. As it turns out, caring for others is valuable, low-carbon work. And we started paying real money to folks like teachers, domestic workers and home health aides.
Those were years of massive change. And not all of it was good. When Hurricane Sheldon hit southern Florida, parts of Miami went underwater for the last time. But as we battled the floods, fires and droughts, we knew how lucky we were to have started acting when we did. And we didn’t just change the infrastructure. We changed how we did things. We became a society that was not only modern and wealthy, but dignified and humane, too. By committing to universal rights like healthcare and meaningful work for all, we stopped being so scared of the future. We stopped being scared of each other. And we found our shared purpose.
Ileana heard the call, too. And in 2028, she ran for office, in the first cycle of publicly funded election campaigns. And now she occupies the seat that I once held. I couldn’t be more proud of her, a true child of the Green New Deal.
When I think back to my first term in Congress, riding that old-school Amtrak in 2018, all of this was still ahead of us, and the first big step was just closing our eyes and imagining it. We can be whatever we have the courage to see.

And in New York City, 62 activists with Extinction Rebellion were arrested after shutting down traffic and staging a die-in outside City Hall on Wednesday. The demonstrators partially blocked access to the Brooklyn Bridge, lying down in the street and scaling stoplights to demand radical action on climate change. Democracy Now!’s Tey Astudillo and Libby Rainey were at the protest.
Extinction Rebellion activists : [singing] “We are the Earth. We are the sea. We won’t stop rising ’til we are free.”
Rev. Chelsea MacMillan : “I’m Reverend Chelsea MacMillan, and this is Extinction Rebellion. We are joining rebels all over the world, standing up for climate change. We need to declare a climate emergency and take swift action to change the course of human history right now. … We’re about to get arrested. We’ve been blocking this road. And we’re here to show New York City that we’re serious, that we need to do something now and we need to do something fast about climate change.”
Extinction Rebellion activist 1 : “How long are we going to let these profit-driven systems drive our extinction? We have less than 12 years!”
Extinction Rebellion activist 2 : “There’s an emergency with the climate, and most people don’t know the gravity of the situation, really. Watch climate videos.”
New York City Police Department : “This is the New York City Police Department. You are unlawfully in the roadway and obstructing vehicular traffic. You are ordered to leave the roadway and utilize the available sidewalk.”
Eve Mosher : “My name is Eve Mosher, and I’m here with Extinction Rebellion. We’re here to get our New York City and New York state government to recognize that climate change is the most urgent issue of our time and that they need to act accordingly. The science shows that we have to make drastic reductions, and we have to make those reductions now. And so we’re out here asking them to act like—Mayor de Blasio has said it is an emergency, and we want him to act like it’s emergency. Extinction Rebellion has four demands. In the U.S., we have the demand that the government and the media tell the truth about the urgency of climate change. We are asking for them to act now to maintain the ecosystem and get us to net zero by 2025, which is very aggressive. We’re also asking for citizens’ assemblies. We don’t trust the government to do this on their own; we need oversight from citizens. And in the U.S., we’re asking for a just transition, that we pay attention to the fact that we’ve caused harm to entire communities with our environmental economy—extractive economy. And we want something done about that.”
Ben Shepard : “I’m Ben Shepard of Brooklyn, New York. We’re here to demand that the mayor declare a climate emergency. I’m the father of two girls. I want them to have a future in New York City. But it looks like the city is going to be flooded, underwater, unless the mayor declares emergency. I’m prepared to get arrested so my kids will have a future. The only way change ever happens in this country is if people put their bodies on the line.”
The New York City Council will vote today on legislation to drastically slash the emissions of big buildings, mandating a 40% emissions reduction by 2030 that would rise to 80% by 2050. Buildings generate two-thirds of New York City’s emissions. The city is one of the first in the U.S. to heed the Green New Deal’s call to upgrade all existing buildings to be more energy efficient.

Back in the United States, police in Colorado say they discovered the body of a Florida teenager Wednesday after she allegedly threatened to mark the 20th anniversary of the Columbine High School shootings with a massacre of her own. Eighteen-year-old Sol Pais was found in the mountains west of Denver, dead of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound. Police said Pais was “infatuated” with the Columbine massacre and traveled to Denver Monday, buying a gun and ammunition before making threats that the FBI called “credible” but nonspecific. The threats prompted authorities to cancel Wednesday classes for more than a half-million students across Colorado’s Front Range. This is John McDonald, director of the Jefferson County Department of School Safety.
John McDonald : “Looking at school shooters and the history of what we’ve seen for the last 20 years, there are some real indicators that we look at—the fact that she was committed; purchased a plane ticket; not only purchased a plane ticket but made that journey, that pilgrimage to Columbine; once she got into our area, purchased a gun.” Topics: "

By Amy Goodman & Denis Moynihan
Christians the world over look to the Holy Land this week as they celebrate Easter and the resurrection of Jesus, while Jews around the globe observe Passover, recalling their exodus from slavery in ancient Egypt. Current events in Israel and Palestine, though, are no cause for celebration, and are adding fuel to racial and political fires here in the United States.
Benjamin Netanyahu secured an unprecedented fifth term as Israel’s prime minister, despite facing possible indictment on corruption charges. Netanyahu successfully energized his base with promises to annex Israel’s many, illegal West Bank settlements, narrowly defeating his main challenger, Benny Gantz.
President Donald Trump amplified Netanyahu’s reelection chances, first by moving the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, then by formally endorsing Israel’s annexation of the occupied Golan Heights, land Israel seized militarily from Syria in 1967. Israel’s domestic politics have consistently veered further and further to the right, while a global movement in solidarity with the Palestinian people, “boycott, divestment and sanctions ( BDS ),” is growing in opposition to Israel’s occupation of the West Bank and its brutal siege of the Gaza Strip.
“Netanyahu offers Israelis safety and security, very, very low mortality rate as part of the occupation and siege,” Israeli journalist Haggai Matar said on the “Democracy Now!” news hour. “Unlike Palestinians who are being killed en masse by Israel.”
The anti-Palestinian rhetoric during the Israeli election was particularly vile. Benny Gantz, the former head of the Israeli military, ran an ad with a rapidly climbing body count laid over images of Palestinian funeral marches. The ad closed with the chilling phrase, in Hebrew, “1,364 terrorists killed — 3.5 years of quiet in the south.” Another ad was run by Oren Hazan, a member of Netanyahu’s right-wing Likud Party, who represents a Jewish-only, illegal West Bank settlement. In it, Hazan’s face is superimposed over Clint Eastwood’s character in “The Good, the Bad and the Ugly” as he kills a man with the face of Jamal Zahalka, a Palestinian member of Israel’s parliament, the Knesset.
Israel is wrongly described as the Middle East’s only democracy — for whom? Diana Buttu, a Palestinian-Canadian attorney and citizen of Israel, spoke to “Democracy Now!” from Haifa, explaining, “about 16% of the people who are eligible to vote are Palestinians who are citizens of Israel. Look at the vast remainder of people that Israel controls … in the West Bank, in the Gaza Strip or in Israeli-occupied East Jerusalem. Close to 6 million individuals who are ineligible to vote in Israeli elections, and yet are being governed by Israel.”
While many Palestinians who were eligible to vote boycotted the election, there is a growing nonviolent resistance movement in the occupied territories and around the world. In Gaza, 2 million people live under Israeli siege in what former U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron called the world’s largest “open-air prison.” For the past year, tens of thousands of Palestinians have marched every Friday to the separation fence between Gaza and Israel. It’s called the “Great March of Return,” and is met by Israeli military snipers who fire live ammunition into the nonviolent crowd. According to the U.N., over 270 Gazans have been killed, at least 41 of whom were children, and close to 30,000 have been injured, with many of those injured suffering amputations. Journalists and medical first responders have also been shot, some fatally.
Just this week, Israel ordered Human Rights Watch’s investigator in Israel, Omar Shakir, to leave the country by May 1st. In response, the Center for Constitutional Rights ( CCR ) said, “The increasing efforts to silence criticism of Israel’s human rights violations are in direct response to the growing criticism.” Last year, Israel deported CCR Executive Director Vince Warren and Board Chair Catherine Franke, a Columbia University professor.
Omar Barghouti is a Palestinian activist who co-founded the BDS movement in 2005 to pressure Israel to comply with international law and respect Palestinian rights. He was scheduled to speak in the United States this week, at Harvard and New York University, and to meet with members of Congress, but was prevented from boarding his plane in Israel. The Trump administration had rescinded his permission to enter the U.S., despite his valid visa, which he has used when visiting many times.
Unable to fly out of Israel, Barghouti appeared on “Democracy Now!” from a TV studio in Ramallah in the occupied West Bank, explaining, “It shows how this right-wing [Trump] administration, which is completely in alliance with Israel’s far-right regime, is terrified of our voices, is terrified of telling the truth.”
Justice and security for Palestinians will only enhance security for Israel. Stifling speech, blocking travel and violating human rights won’t bring peace. A negotiated settlement will. This is viewer supported news. Please do your part today. "

Digital freedom advocates are calling for the release of Swedish programmer and data privacy activist Ola Bini, who has been detained in Ecuador since last Thursday. His arrest came hours after WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange was dragged by British police from the Ecuadorean Embassy in London. Bini is accused of hacking government computers. Prosecutors in Ecuador said they plan to charge Bini with plotting to blackmail Ecuadorean President Lenín Moreno. Critics say Bini is being targeted because of his close relationship with WikiLeaks and Julian Assange. This is his lawyer, Carlos Soria.
Carlos Soria : “What Ola Bini does is encrypt information so that, as a matter of fact, hackers, as you like to call them, do not have access to information and cannot steal it. He does exactly the opposite of what he is being accused of.” Topics:"

The heaviest sanctions will fall on Cuba. They will severely limit the amount of money people in the U.S. can remit to relatives on the island. Meanwhile, U.S. citizens will be allowed to sue companies that do business in Cuba using property that was repatriated by the Cuban revolution. The sanctions drew immediate condemnation from countries around the world, with U.S. allies in Europe and Canada promising counterlawsuits and a challenge at the World Trade Organization. This is former Cuban diplomat Carlos Alzugaray, responding from Havana.
Carlos Alzugaray : “The United States thinks that those octogenarians who were defeated at the Bay of Pigs will win something, but they probably won’t get anything. What I would say to Cubans is: Who is going to take this away from us? We are here.

The American Civil Liberties Union is warning that armed vigilantes are working directly with the U.S. Border Patrol to unlawfully detain hundreds of migrants at gunpoint along the U.S.-Mexico border. The ACLU cites videos posted on social media showing members of a militia group pursuing migrants in New Mexico’s desert west of El Paso, Texas, and effectively kidnapping them against their will. In one video, vigilantes armed with assault rifles are seen approaching a group of several dozen people seated on the ground, as the video’s narrator, a man named Jim Benvie, films.
Jim Benvie : “Hey, guys. This is Jim with the United Constitutional Patriots and We Build the Wall. … As you can see, we did actually end up getting everybody wound up. It was a combination of us and some good horses over there and basically a team effort here.”
In a letter to New Mexico’s governor and attorney general calling for an investigation, the ACLU called the United Constitutional Patriots an “armed fascist militia organization,” adding, “The Trump administration’s vile racism has emboldened white nationalists and fascists to flagrantly violate the law.” The original content of this program is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-No Derivative Works 3.0 United States License .

Winona LaDuke Calls for Indigenous-Led “Green New Deal” as She Fights Minnesota Pipeline Expansion | Democracy Now!,www.democracynow.org,,04-19-2019,2019,4,https://www.democracynow.org/2018/12/7/winona_laduke_calls_for_indigenous_led,"Winona LaDuke Calls for Indigenous-Led “Green New Deal” as She Fights Minnesota Pipeline Expansion Story December 07, 2018 Ojibwe environmental leader and executive director of the group Honor the Earth. 0 Donate
While world leaders converge in Poland for the U.N. climate change summit, we look at the indigenous-led fight against destructive oil pipelines and the revolutionary potential of the Green New Deal with Winona LaDuke, Ojibwe environmental leader and executive director of the group Honor the Earth. She lives and works on the White Earth Reservation in northern Minnesota. This is viewer supported news. Please do your part today. Ojibwe environmental leader and executive director of the group Honor the Earth. Transcript This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.
AMY GOODMAN : The U.N. climate summit is underway in Katowice, Poland, with leaders calling for swift global action. U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres said in his opening remarks climate change is “a matter of life and death” for many nations and that the worst polluters are not doing enough to meet the goals of the 2015 Paris climate agreement.
While world leaders converge in Poland, the indigenous-led fight against destructive oil pipelines continues across North America. In Louisiana, activists suffered a blow Thursday when a judge ruled that the company building the 163-mile Bayou Bridge pipeline had the right to seize private land for construction under eminent domain. This comes despite the fact the judge ruled that pipeline owner Energy Transfer Partners had trespassed on private land during construction, and ordered the company to pay three landowners $150 each. The Bayou Bridge pipeline will carry nearly a half-million barrels of oil per day across Louisiana’s wetlands.
Meanwhile, incoming Congressmember Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and other lawmakers are calling for a Green New deal to revolutionize the U.S. economy to combat climate change.
Well, earlier this week, I spoke with climate activist Winona LaDuke, Native American activist with the Ojibwe Nation, executive director of the group Honor the Earth. She lives and works in the White Earth Reservation in northern Minnesota. I began by asking her what an Indigenous Green New Deal would look like.
WINONA LADUKE : Well, indigenous people obviously have a lot of experience with sustainability, a lot of years of it. And so, if you look across the country, it turns out that the windiest places in the country are Indian reservations. For those of us who were at Standing Rock, Class VII wind. You know, one reservation in North Dakota, the Fort Berthold Reservation, has 17,000 times more wind than they could ever use. So, you start hooking those tribes up to the grid, which already crosses our land with some bad dam projects—look at places like the Navajo Nation, with five coal-fired power plants and four coal strip mines; look at their transition to new solar, for instance, the Kayenta Solar Project—and you’ve got kind of like a cornerstone. You know, we could call it energy justice, or we could just call it the enlightened economy—you know, really where we need to go. And then you look at the issues of agriculture.
I mean, you know, so I come from the White Earth Reservation in northern Minnesota, and we have a plan. You know, my plan is—first of all, I’m looking down the barrel of a very big pipeline, which is a $7 billion boondoggle of stranded assets. We’ll talk about that later. But I’m looking down the pipeline, you know, at the barrel of this pipeline, and I’m looking: What could $7 billion do in Minnesota? What could it do to make a New Green Deal?
So, in my territory, for instance, on the Iron Range, there’s a new solar plant that has gone in to make solar photovoltaic panels. And on my reservation, we are just beginning—and in February we should be operational—a solar thermal panel manufacturing facility to make solar thermal panels that you can put on the south side of your house and reduce your heating bill by about 20 percent. We have solar going in at 20 kilowatts and 200-kilowatt projects.
And then we have this larger vision, which, you know, it’s not just renewable energy. It’s efficiency, and then it’s also local foods and the next economy. Our interest in the next economy—I mean, to be honest with you, Amy, I didn’t really like this economy too much. Didn’t work out too well for my people, you know. So the next economy has to be something that reaffirms our relationship to the Earth and gives us a shot. That, to me, looks like a lot of local food, organic food. If you actually went organic in most of your agriculture, and, for instance—I just read an article—if you ate beans, you know, if we just upped the beans and diminished the cattle, you’d end up with sequestering the carbon in the soil. You know, you don’t need some guys to put something in the sky to keep the carbon out of the sky. You need to put it in the soil. And so you need organic agriculture. That’s what we’re doing in my community.
And the other thing that I’m working on is hemp. I have, for three years, been growing industrial hemp. And what I’m interested in is the next textile economy. This country, in the 1980s and the 1990s, offshored all of our textile manufacturing to Asia. And we don’t produce anything in this country. And I am a hemp grower. Hemp has three times the tensile strength of cotton. Hemp doesn’t use all the water, like 5,000 gallons of water for a T-shirt and jeans, doesn’t use all the chemicals. And, in fact, the word “canvas” comes from “cannabis.” And so, what I want to do is to rebuild the hemp industry in Indian country. And I want us at the table, not on the menu. I want us to be in the leadership of this next economy, because we have a lot of territory upon which you can grow hemp. And we can rebuild the light manufacturing industry in this country.
AMY GOODMAN : And yet you have a president, President Trump, who says climate change is a hoax. When it’s cold in New England, he says, “See? You’re talking about global warming?”
WINONA LADUKE : I’m not going to spend a lot of time rebutting President Trump. I mean, I would spend all day, you know, with that. I mean, to kind of the Native community, he’s kind of like the new incarnation of Andrew Jackson: you know, bad president for Indian people, bad president for everybody. But, you know, to us, and to be super honest, I mean, we don’t have a lot of experience with great presidents. You know, what we have experience with is that we’re going to fight this out, and we’re going to make the next economy. We’re going to make our future. That’s what self-determination is about.
AMY GOODMAN : So, talk about pipeline politics. And for those who aren’t familiar with the pipeline you’re fighting, give us a map of it. You know, interestingly, I was just interviewing Congressmember-elect Deb Haaland of New Mexico. She’s one of two Native American women, the first two—the other Sharice Davids of Kansas—who will be in Congress ever.
WINONA LADUKE : Yeah.
AMY GOODMAN : Deb Haaland went to the standoff at Standing Rock.
WINONA LADUKE : Standing Rock, yes.
AMY GOODMAN : It was a school for so many, even those who are weighing going into electoral politics.
WINONA LADUKE : So, that is right. I mean, Standing Rock was an example of, you know, regulatory capture, when your whole system is controlled by corporations, and in a state that we call the “Deep North.” You know, and you experienced the Deep North. And, you know, so we all got a lesson at Standing Rock. We got a pretty good lesson. And, you know, since that time, pipelines have not gone so well for any of these corporations.
So, just to give you a context, about a year and a half ago there were five tar sands pipelines proposed out of Canada. Now, think of Canada with that pretty guy Trudeau. You know, they might as well just name that pipeline after him he just bought. I mean, he talks about signing up with Paris, but, you know, Canada is a huge polluter, and if the tar sands come online, that’s pretty much game over. But that’s what they’re trying to do. So, to make—you know, to be—
AMY GOODMAN : And explain, just to be clear, about when you said that Trudeau bought.
WINONA LADUKE : So, just to give you this context, about a year and a half ago there were five pipelines proposed out of the tar sands. Tar sands is a landlocked mass of sand that has some oil in it. Super-expensive stuff, super—you know, really bad for the environment. One pipeline was called Energy East. That was to go from Alberta to New Brunswick. The second pipeline was called the Northern Gateway. That was to go from Alberta to the Pacific Coast. The third pipeline was called Trans Mountain, Kinder Morgan’s Trans Mountain. The fourth, Keystone. And the fifth pipeline is called Enbridge Line 3. Five big pipelines to try to get some oil out that’s landlocked.
So, if you look at what’s happened, about a year ago, the Energy East pipeline did not get approved by the National Energy Board. Nobody, it turns out, wanted a pipeline crossing Canada. Surprise, surprise. Montreal didn’t want it. Nobody wanted it. Second pipeline, Northern Gateway, Enbridge’s Northern Gateway, the gem of their Canadian projects, was not approved by the National Energy Board. That leaves three pipelines.
One pipeline known as the Kinder Morgan, facing massive opposition, not only from First Nations but by the good citizens of British Columbia—and the premier of British Columbia opposed—ended up in court because they did not consult with First Nations. The federal court in Canada, the appeals court, revoked all of the permits, nullified all of the permits on Kinder Morgan’s pipeline known as the Trans Mountain pipeline. The same day that that happened, premier Trudeau purchased that pipeline, hoping—you know, for like $4.9 billion; I think the price tag is now something like $15 billion—so that he would—you know, that Canada would have its own personal pipeline to cross the territory. You know, I think it’s kind of a dodgy investment, myself, judging by the courts and judging by the fact that the courts stop pipelines.
Keystone pipeline, as you know, Trump moved ahead, sprinkled his little fairy dust. That pipeline was stopped again in the federal court in Montana. That should be a year, two years—who knows how long?—if they are ever able to meet the conditions. Stopped because Trump, it turns out, could not reverse an Obama decision without a reason. You can’t just go do it because you want to because you’re president .
AMY GOODMAN : And Obama finally stopped it after years of mass protest.
WINONA LADUKE : Right, years of mass—I mean, social movements and lawyers are who stop pipelines. Social movements and lawyers.
This leaves one pipeline that is still considered somewhat viable. That pipeline is Enbridge’s Line 3. That is a 915,000-barrel-a-day tar sands pipeline going from Alberta to Superior. And what is very significant about that pipeline, aside from the fact that it’s the equivalent of 50 new coal-fired generators coming online—exactly what you do not need in the face of the U.N. report and the president’s own reports on climate change out of the administration—but, in addition to that, that feeds into every other pipeline that goes through, for instance, the Straits of Mackinac, the pipeline that is 60 years old. Enbridge’s pipeline is a feeder for most of the infrastructure in the northern Great Lakes territory. So that pipeline is what we are fighting.
And unfortunately for all of us, the Public Utilities Commission of Minnesota issued a rogue decision in favor of that pipeline. You know, to tell you what I mean by a rogue decision is that—you know, I’ve been here a few times talking about this pipeline. But, you know, we had three years of hearings on this pipeline. Seventy-two thousand people came out and testified, of which 69,000 people testified against the pipeline. Equal amount of evidence. The Department of Commerce did not recommend issuing a certificate of need for that pipeline. And in addition to that, the administrative law judge, which reviewed the pipeline for three years, recommended against issuing a permit for the route. In June of this year, the Public Utilities Commission of Minnesota disregarded all evidence, disregarded all recommendations by every agency and issued a permit. And just a couple days after Thanksgiving, they reaffirmed that permit.
AMY GOODMAN : Winona LaDuke, Native American activist with the Ojibwe Nation, executive director of the group Honor the Earth. Back with her in a minute.
[break]
AMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report . I’m Amy Goodman, as we continue our discussion with Winona LaDuke, Ojibwe environmental leader, executive director of the group Honor the Earth. She lives and works on the White Earth Reservation in northern Minnesota. I sat down with her earlier this week.
AMY GOODMAN : So, describe your area for us. You know, when you come on to Democracy Now! , we always say you’re on the White Earth Reservation in northern Minnesota. But describe it for us and where this pipeline is.
WINONA LADUKE : You know, I think about my territory as where the wild things are. Where the wild things are. I have, you know, lynx. I have wolves. I have bears. You know, there are no caribou there now, but there are moose. There are elk. You know, I live in a place where there are still insects. I live in a place where there is still life. And so, that place is northern Minnesota, covered by treaty territories—1855, '54, ’37 and ’42—full of wild rice, full of lakes, lakes that you can still drink from. Lakes that you can still drink from. That's where I live. And that’s what this battle is about. It’s about, you know: Can we protect that?
AMY GOODMAN : When do they say the pipeline will be built?
WINONA LADUKE : They’ve been trying to build it for three years. You know, they say that they will begin construction this year. But, as I said, we are now entering the appeals process. We are hoping that the state of Minnesota joins us in appealing the decision by the PUC , because it was unsupportable according to the Department of Commerce, legally and in any realm. I mean, the insurance itself—the state approved a $1.4 billion insurance agreement with the Enbridge corporation. That was based on the Kalamazoo spill, which was a much smaller spill that’s not really catastrophic. Plus, doesn’t include the 17,000 miles of pipeline that Enbridge has.
And for me, this is part of, you know, what the New Deal has really got to be about. I mean, we are a country that has a D in infrastructure. We have a D in infrastructure. Lawrence, Mass., blows up. Bridges crumble. You know, we are probably losing 30 percent of our gas in aging infrastructure in this country. And so what we need is a New Deal that builds infrastructure for people, not for oil companies. As I said, $7 billion that is for an oil company pipeline, that could be spent much better.
AMY GOODMAN : I’m looking at this invoice you brought in regarding climate damages. Explain.
WINONA LADUKE : Right. OK, so we’ve issued an invoice to the Enbridge corporation, because, you know, in all of their hearings they talk about their power plants are going to be—their pumping stations will be powered with solar. Lipstick on a pig. And, you know, they talk about the climate impact of this pipeline is not significant.
Well, we have a math team at Honor the Earth. And what we figured out is that the carbon equivalent of what they are carrying, if you had to take that out of the environment—which is what basically we have to do—the trending rate is $1,000 a metric ton. And so, the amount of carbon that Enbridge is carrying in, just the carbon itself, is worth $170 billion in expenses annually. The total due, you know, kind of if you’re doing some math and aggregating the combined impact of such a badly planned project, is $266 billion annually.
And so we have issued an invoice from the creator—you know, Honor the Earth acting on behalf of the creator—to the Enbridge corporation, saying that they should pay this amount. We would prefer to have it early on, because, according to Moody’s, they were downgraded to just above junk bond status in December. And so, with the experience that Americans and Native people have of multinational corporations like Enron going bankrupt, we think it would be wise to collect the money in advance.
AMY GOODMAN : So you’ve got Line 3 carbon, metric ton, then boreal forest.
WINONA LADUKE : Yeah. There’s a price to destroying boreal forest.
AMY GOODMAN : And explain what a boreal forest is.
WINONA LADUKE : The tar sands is a boreal forest. You know, and you turn something that is the oxygen of the North—I mean, the boreal forest of northern Canada—of Canada is the equivalent of the lungs. It’s the Amazon of the North. It’s the Amazon of the North. And that is what is being destroyed by the tar sands. Wetland—this is just going through our wetlands. The value of a wetland—you know, I’m an economist by training, but how do you value a wetland for what it does for Mother Earth and for the planet and for your water and for insects and for where the wild things are? You know, but there are some numbers that have been associated with it. We did some math. We multiplied those numbers out. You know, Enbridge’s math skills were not ours. And so, you know, we’ve issued this invoice.
AMY GOODMAN : And finally, social cost.
WINONA LADUKE : You know, I’m not sure how to quantify that, but the perfect example is, is that even without a spill, you know, the threat of a spill in a community who relies on wild rice is very traumatic. Having a megaproject shoved down your throat causes suicide in Native communities. You know, we already have diabetes and every other epidemic that you do not want to have, and nothing in this pipeline contributes to our well-being. So who’s paying for that? Who’s paying for that? The state of Minnesota is who made the decision to shove the pipeline down our throats, and so we will fight them. We will fight them.
AMY GOODMAN : What does the state and the federal government gain by these pipeline?
WINONA LADUKE : You know, I refer—
AMY GOODMAN : They’re private, right?
WINONA LADUKE : This is a private pipeline—
AMY GOODMAN : Unless it’s Trudeau buying Kinder Morgan—
WINONA LADUKE : Right.
AMY GOODMAN : —because Kinder Morgan says they can’t afford it anymore.
WINONA LADUKE : I mean, to be honest with you, I feel that the state of Minnesota, and now the state of Michigan, which is trying to approve a deal to put a tunnel around the pipeline under the Straits of Mackinac, around the pipeline, that Enbridge will pay for, but, you know, to just keep the oil going—I feel that the state suffers from the Stockholm syndrome. You know, they have been told by Enbridge that their pipelines are going to leak. And so, if their pipes are going to leak, you need to replace them. And so, my position to the state of Minnesota or the state of Michigan would be: remove the gun. You know, the Public Utilities Commission said they felt like they had a gun to their head by the Enbridge corporation, that the pipe was going to leak, and so they would need a new pipe. I said, “Remove the gun. Remove the gun. You’re a regulatory agency. You know, you need to get out of the Stockholm syndrome.”
And, you know, so there is the representation that there are jobs that will occur, but everybody knows that the 1,200 jobs that will occur over the course of six months of building—you know, what they will have a lot more jobs in is the militarization of the North. I mean, in this pipeline’s case, the state of Minnesota Public Utilities Commission, when they approved the pipeline, looked to the Enbridge corporation, a Canadian multinational corporation, and said, “Will you pay the police? Will you pay for the police that it will take to install this pipeline?” That’s what Commissioner Tuma said. And Enbridge said yes. And so, to me, that is a pretty significant crisis in democracy. We know that Standing Rock cost North Dakota $38 million, and they’re still trying to recuperate that. And so, since you have 300 miles of pipe that no one wants in Minnesota, try to project those costs, Minnesota.
AMY GOODMAN : What about insurance?
WINONA LADUKE : Ah, the insurance of Enbridge. You know, first of all, how do you insure for a big pipeline? I mean, they said it was $1.4 billion to clean up the Kalamazoo spill. The Kalamazoo pipe was about—
AMY GOODMAN : When was that spill?
WINONA LADUKE : 2010. And the Kalamazoo spill cost $1.4 billion, not necessarily fully cleaned up. But besides that, that was about 300,000 barrels per day. This pipeline is at 915,000 barrels per day. If they had a worst-case—and that, and the $1.4 billion for cleanup of the Kalamazoo spill, which went for 17 hours, in not a remote location, was not considered catastrophic by the Enbridge corporation. So, what is a catastrophic spill? You know, if that pipeline breached in Minnesota, the low estimates are $2.4 billion for a catastrophic spill. A spill of the Enbridge corporation’s 50-year-old pipeline in the Straits of Mackinac, well over $6 billion.
So, to me, one of the questions that I have is that: If you are a regulatory agency, why would you approve an insurance guarantee for lower than the price of any potential spill? And, in fact, it’s not in a kitty; it’s in Enbridge’s—it’s in Enbridge’s accounts. We would not make the assumption that there would not be more than one spill on an Enbridge line. There’s a spill almost every day, it seems. And so, that insurance policy, Enbridge’s total insurance policy that they are holding right now in their general insurance, is $940 million. And they have 17,000 miles of pipeline. No prudent regulatory agency would have approved an insurance settlement or an insurance agreement like that.
AMY GOODMAN : We’re broadcasting from Katowice, Poland, all week for the U.N. climate summit. These major reports have come out of both the United Nations and President Trump’s own administration.
WINONA LADUKE : Right.
AMY GOODMAN : Thirteen federal agencies, hundreds of scientists—which he poopoos because he says he doesn’t believe in climate change. But these reports that say we are in the endgame now. I mean, we just came from California, the fires there that devastated communities.
WINONA LADUKE : Yeah. I mean, you know, as I look out there, this is the time of, you know, catastrophes of biblical proportions, if we are going to call it that. You know, to the south, you have the great floods. To the west, the entire West Coast is on fire. To the north, the ice is melting, and polar bears are eating each other. And to the east, you have a crazy man with orange hair whose theme song seems to be Talking Heads’“Burning Down the House.” You know, I mean, I have no idea. That is catastrophe in itself, you know?
And so, I look out there as an indigenous person. Our prophecies talk about this time. I can tell you that. I could say, “We told you so.” You know, for the past hundred years we’ve been saying—you know, for the past hundred years we’ve been saying, you know, in the time of the seventh fire, you’re going to have to make a choice between two paths: one well worn and scorched, and the other not. And that is this moment, you know, where we have a choice.
And in my analogy, you know, one time I was sitting in Sitka, Alaska—did you ever get a chance to go there? Beautiful. Like sometimes you just go someplace. I was at a writers’ workshop. I was in Sitka, Alaska, and I was watching—you know, the eagles were capturing the salmon that had come in. And so there was like eagles diving down into the ocean, and, you know, the salmon. And there were bears. And I looked out there, and I saw this cruise ship coming into the left of my vision. And it came in, and I was like, “Oh, I don’t like that.” The cruise ship came in, and then I watched that cruise ship turn a 180 and go exactly back out.
And that’s basically what we’ve got to do. You know, we have to make the next economy, and that next economy is going to be green. That next economy is going to have people like me making decisions. I’d like to be an architect for the next economy. I didn’t like the last one.
AMY GOODMAN : Well, you ran for vice president with Ralph Nader.
WINONA LADUKE : I did. I did run for vice president.
AMY GOODMAN : Are you considering electoral politics again?
WINONA LADUKE : Well, I did just—I did just apply for an appointed position on the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission. The chair has now left, and I have announced—I submitted my application to be on the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission.
AMY GOODMAN : Who decides?
WINONA LADUKE : I believe the governor. And in my personal opinion—I mean, in my experience, you know, I have a lot of interest in infrastructure and public policy. I’ve spent a whole life working on it. And I think we should have infrastructure for people, and there should be equitable infrastructure. So, you know, that is my next position that I’m applying for. We will see how it goes.
AMY GOODMAN : Who is the governor that will decide?
WINONA LADUKE : Well, Walz may decide. I think Walz will probably decide, although Dayton is in. And in Minnesota, you know, what I have to say is that we also worked to get out the vote. Minnesota had the highest record of voter turnout in a midterm election of any state. And my reservation and my community, we took our bus—we have a bus that says “Stop Line 3”—and we ran what we called Rez Uber. We drove people to town to ride the bus—we drove people to town to vote. And we personally got a lot of people out to vote who never would have voted in this election.

"The Mueller Report: Glenn Greenwald vs. David Cay Johnston on Trump-Russia Ties, Obstruction & More",www.democracynow.org,mail@democracynow.org (Democracy Now!),04-19-2019,2019,4,https://www.democracynow.org/2019/4/19/the_mueller_report_glenn_greenwald_vs,"Transcript This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.
AMY GOODMAN : On Thursday, the Justice Department released a redacted version of special counsel Robert Mueller’s 448-page report detailing Russian meddling in the 2016 election, the Trump campaign’s contacts with Russia and President Trump’s attempts to obstruct justice in the special counsel’s investigation. The report states, quote, the campaign expected to “benefit electorally from information stolen and released through Russian efforts,” but Mueller concluded, “the investigation did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.”
Mueller also outlined at least 10 instances where Trump attempted to impede the special counsel’s investigation, but Mueller came to no definitive conclusion on whether Trump broke the law by obstructing justice. In the report, Mueller suggests this is a decision for Congress to make. The report states, quote, “With respect to whether the president can be found to have obstructed justice by exercising his powers under Article II of the Constitution, we concluded Congress has authority to prohibit a President’s corrupt use of his authority in order to protect the integrity of the administration of justice,” unquote.
But many questions remain about the Mueller report. About 10% of the report was redacted. Mueller has yet to speak publicly about his findings.
On Thursday, Attorney General William Barr held a news conference before the redacted report was released. Barr defended the president’s actions, claiming Trump had a, quote, “sincere belief” that Mueller’s probe was undermining his presidency.
ATTORNEY GENERAL WILLIAM BARR : In assessing the president’s actions discussed in the report, it is important to bear in mind the context. President Trump faced an unprecedented situation. As he entered into office and sought to perform his responsibilities as president, federal agents and prosecutors were scrutinizing his conduct before and after taking office, and the conduct of some of his associates. At the same, there was relentless speculation in the news media about the president’s personal culpability.
Yet, as he said from the beginning, there was in fact no collusion. And as the special counsel’s report acknowledges, there is substantial evidence to show that the president was frustrated and angered by his sincere belief that the investigation was undermining his presidency, propelled by his political opponents and fueled by illegal leaks. Nonetheless, the White House fully cooperated with the special counsel’s investigation, providing unfettered access to campaign and White House documents, directing senior aides to testify freely, and asserting no privilege claims.
AMY GOODMAN : Democratic lawmakers are accusing Attorney General Barr of mischaracterizing some of Mueller’s findings. House Judiciary Chair Jerrold Nadler has announced plans to issue a subpoena for the full, unredacted Mueller report and to request Mueller testify before the committee. Nadler spoke in New York Thursday.
REP . JERROLD NADLER : Even in its incomplete form, however, the Mueller report outlines disturbing evidence that President Trump engaged in obstruction of justice and other misconduct. Contrary to the attorney general’s statement this morning that the White House, quote, “fully cooperated,” unquote, with the investigation, the report makes clear that the president refused to be interviewed by the special counsel and refused to provide written answers to follow-up questions, page 13 of volume two; makes clear that his associates destroyed evidence relevant to the Russian investigation, page 10, volume one. The report concluded there was “substantial evidence,” in quotes, that President Trump attempted to prevent an investigation into his campaign and his own conduct, page 76, page 78, page 90, page 157, volume two.
AMY GOODMAN : While Democrats urged further congressional probes into the findings of the report, some went further, turning to talk of impeachment, in the hours after the report was released.
For more, we’re joined by two guests. Glenn Greenwald, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, founding editor of The Intercept , leading critic of the media coverage of alleged Russian collusion, he joins us from Rio de Janeiro in Brazil. And David Cay Johnston is also a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative reporter, previously with The New York Times , now founder and editor of DCReport.org . He has covered Trump for years. His most recent book on him, It’s Even Worse Than You Think: What the Trump Administration Is Doing to America .
We welcome you both back to Democracy Now! for this rematch. Today let’s begin with Glenn Greenwald in Brazil. As you read through the 448-page report, Glenn, your overall response and what you thought was most significant about what Robert Mueller and his team found?
GLENN GREENWALD : I don’t think there can be any question that the most significant finding has to be about the allegations that kicked off the entire saga almost three years ago, which was the two-pronged conspiracy theory that Donald Trump worked with, coordinated, collaborated and conspired with the Russian government to interfere in the 2016 election and that Donald Trump is captive to Vladimir Putin as a result of a variety of blackmail, leverage and other forms of links that allow the Kremlin to dictate to the White House what it is that they’re supposed to do.
And I think it’s very important to point out from the outset that this was no ordinary investigation. The Democrats, the CIA , their allies in the media, who believed in this conspiracy theory, got exactly the prosecutor that they wanted, who everybody agreed was the man of the highest integrity and competence. He assembled a vast team of very aggressive prosecutors, FBI agents, forensic accountants, intelligence analysts. He had unlimited resources, the entire apparatus of the U.S. surveillance state at his disposal and 22 months to dig as deeply as he could dig to find out the answers to whether those conspiracy theories were or weren’t true. You can’t get a more sweeping or comprehensive investigation than that.
And he went through systematically each of the prongs of the conspiracy theories and found either that the evidence did not establish that they were true, or, in some cases, found the opposite, that in fact there was no evidence to support the theory at all and that the theory was simply false. One example of that is, for example—I think David mentioned this the last time we talked about it, as evidence that there was something sinister going on between the Russians and Trump—was the change to the GOP platform in mid-2016 to make it more favorable to the Russians by diluting the language about U.S. support for Ukraine. And at the time, I had always said, and said on the show the last time, that that was totally consistent with both Barack Obama and Donald Trump’s foreign policy, not to provoke Vladimir Putin by arming the Ukrainians. Mueller said this is done by some low-level aide, acting alone; there’s no evidence he coordinated it with even Donald Trump, let alone with the Russians or Vladimir Putin; and that it was just an attempt to conform the GOP platform to what Trump’s stated foreign policy was. And over and over and over, from the Trump Tower meeting to all of the post—Russian connections after both the convention and the election, Mueller used the same language over and over and over again, which is that there’s no evidence, or the evidence does not establish that these conspiracy theories actually happened.
Now, you can continue to believe in them. It sort of feels almost like arguing with people who have adopted religious beliefs, that they’re going to believe in their view of how the world works, no matter how much evidence you present them that it didn’t happen. But Democrats and proponents of this theory got what they wanted, which is the Mueller investigation, and now most of the Mueller report and his findings. And his findings are that he looked for 22 months as hard as he could and didn’t establish that these theories were true. And we already knew that because not one American was indicted or charged for conspiracy. But he went even beyond that and said the evidence doesn’t establish it.
On the obstruction issue, I think there’s a lot of evidence that Donald Trump is what we knew he was, which is an amoral liar, somebody who is willing to corruptly abuse his power to protect himself. But at the end of the day, the Democrat leaders in the House have already said they’re not going to impeach him over this. And the reason is, is because the question always was: Was Trump trying to stop the investigation because he genuinely believed that they were—it was based on a false conspiracy, or was he trying to stop the investigation because he knew he had done what people were accusing him of doing with the Russians and wanted to cover that up? And the Mueller report concluded it was the first instance: He was try to stop the investigation because he thought it was a sham all along, and therefore, even though he lied and acted improperly, it doesn’t rise to the corrupt intent needed to charge him with obstruction, which is stopping an investigation to prevent your own wrongdoing from being uncovered. And so, I think even Democrats know this is the end of the line with this entire three-year scandal that has drowned our politics in discourse.
AMY GOODMAN : David Cay Johnston, your takeaway from this report that was released, oh, about 20 hours ago, as of this broadcast?
DAVID CAY JOHNSTON : Well, Amy, I agree with Glenn that Donald Trump is utterly unfit to hold office. But I think he is misreading what’s in the report. Mueller was charged with investigating to the standard of beyond reasonable doubt, a criminal standard. What he shows in the report is numerous contacts by the Russians trying to develop a relationship with the Trump campaign, the willingness of the Trump campaign and the eagerness of the Trump campaign to benefit from anything the Russians could do for them, including numerous contacts, some of them with known Russian spies. And Mueller writes something Glenn didn’t mention, that is very significant, near the top of his report: A statement that the investigation did not establish particular facts does not mean that there was no evidence of those facts. There’s lots of evidence here of improprieties. Does it rise to the standard of a criminal conspiracy charge under federal law? No. Mueller says this is properly the duty of Congress. And the standard in our Constitution is that the president takes an oath to faithfully execute the laws. We have to expect our president to be totally and completely loyal to the interests of the United States. That’s why the word “emoluments” appears three times in our Constitution. And the standard is abuse of power, or, in the words of our Constitution, high crimes and misdemeanors.
Now, I don’t think Donald Trump is going to be impeached, because there aren’t the votes to convict him. But that Donald Trump was eager, and his son Don Jr. and others in his campaign were eager, to get help from the Russians, the report explicitly states. That the Russians were eager to make sure that Hillary Clinton didn’t win, that they help both Trump and Bernie Sanders, is clearly stated in the report. So, to suggest that there’s nothing here and we should forget all this and it’s corrupted our politics, Glenn and I just fundamentally disagree about that. I think this report makes very clear that Donald Trump behaved in ways that are not loyal to the United States. He urged his staff, contrary to what Attorney General Barr said about complete cooperation, to lie, to deny, to cover up, to destroy records. He would not sit for an interview. He would not respond to further questions. And the answers in writing that he provided are artful, lawyerly-like arguments that evade. That we can’t close the loop on a conspiracy between the very best Russians at intelligence and spying, with the head of a third-generation, white-collar crime family who spent his entire life lying and denying; has been found by judges, after testifying in trials, to give testimony that wasn’t incredible; that he had convenient lapses of memory—and let’s remember Donald Trump claims to have the best memory of any living human being—all of that points to simply the fact that Mueller found lots of evidence, but nowhere near enough to meet the criminal standard of beyond reasonable doubt. That’s why he specifically refers to Congress and that this falls under the duties of Congress to look into.
AMY GOODMAN : Glenn Greenwald, your response to David?
GLENN GREENWALD : So, first of all, just as reminder, the Democrats control the House of Representatives, which is the body charged with impeaching President Trump. It’s the Senate that determines whether he ought to be convicted. So, in both of the cases of Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton, when impeachment charges were brought, there was a lot of uncertainty about whether convictions could be obtained. But the House did its duty, anyway, under the Constitution, which is, if you really believe that Donald Trump committed serious crimes, it’s the constitutional duty of the Democrats in the House to impeach Donald Trump and then present the arguments and the evidence to convince the public that he ought to be removed from office. And they’ve made clear they’re not going to do that. And I think that’s pretty revealing.
I also want to say that David actually mischaracterized both what I said and what the Mueller report said. So, I made very clear that, in some instances, Mueller did what he was charged to do, which is to say whether there was enough evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt in order to indict Trump and his family members and aides on the issue of conspiracy and collusion, and he found that there wasn’t. That’s incredibly significant. You can just brush that aside if you want, but we all know that everybody spent the last three years saying Trump Jr. and Jared Kushner are inevitably about to be arrested, and then none of that happened. But the reality—so, I didn’t leave that out. I specifically said that there was parts of the report where Mueller simply said there’s not enough evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt.
But in other areas of the report, on collusion, Mueller went much further than that, to say not just that there’s not enough evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt, but that there’s no evidence at all that this happened. And the language that he used, which I’m going to have to read, since David claims that it isn’t in there, is that Mueller himself said, “in some instances, the report points out the absence of evidence … about a particular fact or event.” For example, he says the Internet Research Agency, the Russia-based trolling farm, used Facebook posts and tweets to try and disrupt the election. And he says, “The investigation did not identify evidence that any U.S. persons knowingly or intentionally coordinated with the IRA’s interference operation.” As I said, he made the same exact claim about the change to the GOP platform regarding Ukraine, that there was no evidence—not that it didn’t rise to the standard of beyond a reasonable doubt, that there was no evidence this was anything other than a low-level aide acting on his own to change the platform, without even the knowledge of Trump, let alone Putin, to conform it to Trump’s stated foreign policy. And the same is true with all of the attempts after the convention, once Trump was nominated, by Ambassador Kislyak to try and talk to the foreign policy officials within the Trump campaign. Mueller says, “The Office did not identify any evidence” in those interactions of coordination between the campaign and the Russian government. And I could read 10 more examples like that.
So, Mueller was not only charged with this cramped, narrow, legalistic, prosecutorial duty to say whether evidence rose to a standard of a beyond a reasonable doubt—which, again, even if he had only done that and concluded that not one American—not Carter Page, George Papadopoulos, not one American—was an agent of the Russian government while working for Trump, coordinated or conspired with the Trump—with the Russian government over the campaign, that would be incredibly fatal to everything the media has been doing and saying over the last three years. But he went well beyond that, as I just read, in multiple instances, and said that so much of what we were told just didn’t happen.
The BuzzFeed story about Michael Cohen telling Mueller that Trump told him to lie, BuzzFeed now admits that never happened. Paul Manafort visiting Julian Assange three times in the Ecuadorean Embassy, as The Guardian reported, that didn’t happen. Virtually the entirety of the Steele dossier, that there were these overwhelming, year-long contacts between the Trump campaign and Russia to plan the dissemination of disinformation—the fact that they were using Roger Stone, three weeks before the WikiLeaks release, to try and find out what was in those documents that WikiLeaks has, as Mike Isikoff himself, one of the proponents, the earliest proponents, of this conspiracy theory admitted, by itself proves that the Trump campaign wasn’t doing what the Steele dossier said, since had they been in bed with the Russians all year, they wouldn’t have needed Roger Stone, two weeks before the WikiLeaks release, to find out what was in the emails. They would have been a party to it. But they weren’t. The whole thing was false. It was a scam. It was a hoax.
And again, as I said, you can just throw up your hands and say, “Well, maybe Mueller just didn’t find the evidence.” I mean, how do you argue with somebody like that? Yeah, of course, I mean, maybe Robert Mueller, after 22 months, didn’t find all the smoking guns that are out there. But we can only deal with the reality that we have, which is the reality that was produced after an incredibly comprehensive investigation, a sweeping, invasive, powerful one, that was exactly what the Democrats said they wanted. And that evidence simply did not produce the evidence to substantiate the conspiracy theories we’ve been hearing for three years. And that reality will never, ever change.
AMY GOODMAN : David Cay Johnston, we’re going to let you respond, but after this music break. David Cay Johnston and Glenn Greenwald debate the Mueller report. Stay with us.
[break]
AMY GOODMAN : Tina Turner, covering The Beatles’ 1969 song “Come Together.” This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report . I’m Amy Goodman, as we continue our debate for the hour, the rematch of two Pulitzer Prize-winning journalists, David Cay Johnston and Glenn Greenwald.
David Cay Johnston, it’s your turn, up next, but I wanted to also throw in another part of the Mueller report, where he wrote, “We recognized that a federal criminal accusation against a sitting President would place burdens on the President’s capacity to govern and potentially preempt constitutional processes for addressing presidential misconduct.” The report went on to say, Mueller’s team, quote, “determined not to apply an approach that could potentially result in a judgment that the President committed crimes.” So, if you could respond to the numerous points Glenn Greenwald just raised and also that approach, which he says is going along with Department of Justice rules?
DAVID CAY JOHNSTON : Well, let’s deal with that part first. I think it’s pretty clear from the report that Mueller has problems with the Office of Legal Counsel position that you can’t indict a sitting president. Lots of people do. I do. Laurence Tribe of Harvard, who’s a great constitutional scholar, and others do. But it’s the policy. And Robert Mueller is a straight-arrow guy, so he followed the policy. And that’s partly why his report says these are matters for Congress to take up.
This is not a black-and-white situation. I think Glenn has overstated the facts by suggesting there’s absolutely nothing here, it’s completely wrong, it’s been a scam, he calls it. In fact, there is an enormous amount of evidence in this report, damning evidence, that Donald Trump’s campaign was eager to get help from the Russian government. We know that they were eager to do so, for a variety of reasons, among them, Don Jr.'s “love it” email and the subsequent efforts to lie, deny and cover up about that; Donald Trump's refusal to sit for an interview; his directing people to behave inappropriately, through either not cooperating, destroying records, etc. I mean, imagine if a previous president, let’s say Barack Obama, had had a meeting with the head of the government in Iran and had only gone with a translator from the Iranian government, or, on another occasion, with a translator from each side and had the American translator destroy their notes. I think we’d all say, “Woah! What is going on here?”
The report is clear that the Russians, through Konstantin Kilimnik, were provided with very sensitive, confidential information about polling data, that was then used to use targeted ads on Facebook. And let me explain. On Facebook, they can slice and dice stuff so that if you said, “We only want the ads to be seen by white males in the state of Wisconsin between the age of 55 and 65 who lease a Chevrolet vehicle that is not a sedan,” you can buy that ad. And so, they were able to highly target these ads. Now, that doesn’t rise to the level of a criminal conspiracy in Mueller’s view, and I totally accept that. I don’t question what’s in Mueller’s report. But the fact that they couldn’t close the loop on contacts and what was going on here, as the report says, the statement that the investigation did not establish particular facts does not mean that there is no evidence of those facts. And that’s why Mueller referred this to Congress.
That Donald Trump repeatedly lied, that the Mueller report shows that things Donald Trump called fake news he knew to be true news, and is in the Mueller report, goes to the issue Glenn and I agree on about, which is that Donald Trump is a morally corrupt, totally unfit person to be president. So, I think the report is damning as to the willingness of the Trump people to receive information, the eagerness of the Russians—and notice the report talks about the Russian government, not so much the oligarchs. Vladimir Putin, we know from this report, meets regularly with about 50 of the oligarchs and works through them. And they are not the Russian government, but they are certainly the agents of the Russian government. And that all of this material went on during the campaign and Trump lied, denied and covered up is evidence that he had a guilty mind. He had mens rea .
And so, I think that we need to recognize that while there is, without question, not the material to sustain, even if you could indict a sitting president, any kind of indictment for conspiracy—which is the word I’ve generally used, by the way—the fact is there’s a ton of damning evidence here of inappropriate conduct for a president. You take an oath of office to faithfully execute the laws. Your loyalty should be entirely to the United States. The Russians are dangling multimillion-dollar opportunities in front of Donald Trump. He lies about them. They approach—that they didn’t close deals is not—is important, but they approached them, and they were willingly embraced in a meeting by Don Jr., Paul Manafort and Jared Kushner. And this report shows extensive contacts that are very troubling. Some of them are not. Some of them turn out to be insignificant, passing conversations and things. And I agree with Glenn, some of them—and I thought so at the time—were blown up to be too big of a deal. But to say, as I think Glenn is fundamentally arguing, that there’s nothing here—he just called it a scam—I think that goes way beyond the facts and way beyond Mueller’s point that this should go to Congress and that, as he said, the statement that the investigation did not establish facts, particular facts, does not mean there was no evidence of those facts.
AMY GOODMAN : Glenn Greenwald?
GLENN GREENWALD : So, I think this—first of all, if you notice, everybody who was behind this conspiracy is starting, very bluntly, to try and conflate obstruction with collusion and, essentially, forget about the whole conspiracy and collusion part of the story and focus on obstruction, because the reality is the Mueller report—and not just the Mueller report, but the Mueller investigation—destroyed all of the predictions and hopes about what it would result in and what it would find. And that’s why there’s now this almost monomaniacal focus on the obstruction part of this story, at the expense of the collusion part.
Let me just say a couple things. This fixation on this legalistic language that Mueller included in his report, which is that a finding that we didn’t establish something doesn’t mean it didn’t happen, or doesn’t mean there’s no evidence for it, is incredibly irrational. Let me just give you an example. I can conduct an investigation and then come back and say, “My investigation did not establish that there are Martians who are controlling all of our thoughts and all of our actions using mind control methods.” That would be true. I would conduct an investigation. The evidence wouldn’t establish that. But it would also be true, I would add, that just because I didn’t find evidence to establish that doesn’t meet it didn’t happen. That’s because you can’t prove a negative. That’s all Mueller is saying. Just because our investigation didn’t demonstrate that these things took place doesn’t mean they didn’t happen, doesn’t mean that you can’t look at some events in certain ways and say that there’s some evidence for it. But, as I said, in many cases he said there was no evidence, and in many cases he says, “Our investigation did not establish.” And to try and minimize that, after three years of everything that has been dominating the news, I think, is very disingenuous.
On the question of whether or not there are disturbing aspects of Trump’s behavior, I agree that the obstruction part of the report, again, reveals some things that Donald Trump did that are, for me, utterly unsurprising, but nonetheless showing his utter lack of ethics, which is something I’ve known for 30 years living in New York. But on the part of the report that deals with everything that kicked this all off, which was Trump’s relationship with Russia, the only thing that is in the report, that David keeps harping on, is the idea that Trump and his campaign was willing to accept help from the Russians. And that’s true. When the Russians called and said, “Hey, we have some dirt about your adversary, Hillary Clinton, that shows her to be really corrupt and criminal, and we would like to give it to you,” the Trump campaign said, “Yeah, we’d love to get that.” Now, you can say, “Well, that’s just an unethical thing to do.” It’s clearly not illegal, according to Robert Mueller, because it doesn’t even rise to the level under the statute where you can make it a crime under campaign finance law, let alone conspiracy. But you can say it’s unethical, if you want.
But then you have to deal with this fact: The DNC had contractors working for it, collaborating, coordinating and working with the Ukrainian government, to dig up dirt on Paul Manafort and Donald Trump’s finances. And they succeeded in doing it. They got dirt about Paul Manafort from the Ukrainian government, because the Ukrainians wanted to help Hillary Clinton win the election, because they thought that she would be better for them than Donald Trump would be. The Steele dossier was built by someone being paid by the Democratic National Committee and the Hillary Clinton campaign, Christopher Steele, going through Moscow, working with his contacts within the Russian government, to try and get dirt about Donald Trump.
So, if you really believe that it’s so nefarious for a political campaign to try and get dirt about your opponent if you work with a foreign government to do it, why isn’t the outrage just as high when it comes to the DNC’s efforts to work with the Ukrainian government to dig up dirt about Manafort and Trump, or the use of Christopher Steele to get dirt from his contacts within Russian intelligence about Donald Trump, much of which turned out to be, if not all of it, utterly false? So, I think that that’s the most you can say, and then the question becomes: Why doesn’t that apply equally to the Democrats?
And then, I would finally add, I mean, if I were David Cay Johnston and people who thought like him, my focus now would be on demanding to know why people like Steny Hoyer and Adam Schiff and, up until now, Nancy Pelosi have pretty much said impeachment is off the table. Like, if you really believe that this is a grave threat to the republic, that these are serious crimes and misdemeanors that Donald Trump has engaged in, in abusing his power, how can you not be protesting in the streets against the leaders of the House of Representatives for failing in their constitutional duty to initiate impeachment proceedings against Donald Trump? How can it be justified, if it were really as egregious as is being suggested by David and others, for them not to do that?
AMY GOODMAN : Well, David Cay Johnston, do you think the House should move to impeach President Trump?
DAVID CAY JOHNSTON : Well, I don’t think they’re going to, because there aren’t votes in the Senate to convict. And so it would be pointless. You need 67 votes. And the Republican senators are simply not going to vote, even though, in private, many of them have made it clear, in conversations with people, that they are deeply disturbed and think Donald Trump is unfit to serve.
But, you know, Glenn said something a moment ago that is absolutely false, and I don’t want to let it slide. The Steele dossier, that was first paid for through Fusion GPS , run by a former excellent reporter for The Wall Street Journal , was initially financed by Republicans. Only after Donald Trump got the nomination did a front for Hillary Clinton, a law firm, then come in and start paying for additional work. And so, to suggest this was a DNC project is just false.
As to foreign governments, I think it’s totally inappropriate that we have these foreign—
GLENN GREENWALD : Just to be clear, I agree. Just to be—let me just interject. I agree with that. I didn’t—all I said was that the Democrats paid for that report.
DAVID CAY JOHNSTON : OK, fine.
GLENN GREENWALD : I didn’t say that they initiated the project.
DAVID CAY JOHNSTON : Fine, fine.
GLENN GREENWALD : You’re absolutely right about that. But the Democrats did pay for Christopher Steele’s work.
DAVID CAY JOHNSTON : They paid for part of it later, that’s correct.
GLENN GREENWALD : Yeah.
DAVID CAY JOHNSTON : I mean, I think this whole episode has brought to light serious shortcomings. And I’m somebody who has exposed spies and foreign agents here, going back many decades. There are real serious shortcomings in our laws. We should not be having a lot of these international contacts. But Donald Trump—the reason I think the obstruction issue is in fact highly relevant here is: Why would you lie and deny, if you haven’t done anything wrong? Lying and denying is evidence of a guilty mind. And Donald Trump lied and denied, directed other people to lie. He is essentially an unindicted co-conspirator, individual one in the criminal charges that were pled to as campaign violations by Michael Cohen.
Mueller concluded that the help that was provided couldn’t be valued, and it would be a very difficult thing to do and to suss out in terms of our campaign finance laws. But that the Trump campaign provided sensitive information that helped the Russians in their efforts to make sure that Hillary Clinton didn’t get in the White House—and, remember, the Russians also tried to help the Bernie Sanders campaign for the same reason. They did not want Hillary Clinton, because she had made it clear she was going to do everything she could, short of war, to make Vladimir Putin give up Crimea and other actions. To suggest there’s nothing going on here is, I think, just wrong. There’s lots of evidence of it. And you don’t lie, deny, obstruct and cover up, unless you know you’ve done something wrong. It may not be wrong to a criminal standard, and Mueller has said it’s not—we can’t prove anything to the criminal standard of beyond a reasonable doubt. But they show an enormous amount of conduct that is improper. If you get a call from a hostile foreign power, as Don Jr. did when he got his email, and you don’t pick up the phone and call FBI counterintelligence, I think—and I would hope that Glenn would agree with me—that that is not an act of a patriot or a loyal person or even one with a fundamental sense of decency and morality.
AMY GOODMAN : We’re going to have to break. I know that Glenn is chomping at the bit, and you’ll get your response in a minute, Glenn. We’re speaking with Pulitzer Prize-winning journalists David Cay Johnston and Glenn Greenwald on the release of the Mueller report—well, a part of it. It was redacted. Stay with us.
[break]
AMY GOODMAN : “Putting Up Resistance” by Beres Hammond. This is Democracy Now! I’m Amy Goodman. We’re conducting a debate, a rematch, between two Pulitzer Prize-winning journalists, Glenn Greenwald and David Cay Johnston, upon the release of the special counsel Robert Mueller’s 448-page report that concluded that the Trump campaign did not collude, did not conspire with the Russians to win the election, but did say that on the issue of obstruction of justice, Congress should decide. Glenn Greenwald, if you want to pick up where Johnston left off: Why didn’t Donald Trump Jr. go directly to the FBI when he was reached out to by Russian agents to ask if they wanted damaging information about Hillary Clinton, and also why Donald Trump obstructed and lied about so much?
GLENN GREENWALD : So, on that issue of Donald Trump Jr., the main point I made in my prior answer, which was a question to David, was completely ignored by him, about what the Democrats did with the Ukrainian government. And I’m interesting in reposing that question to him in just a second. And before I do, I just want to address something he said—
DAVID CAY JOHNSTON : Not true, but go ahead.
GLENN GREENWALD : —that I think is really important—OK, which was—then maybe I missed it, so I’m interested in hearing again. But David said that Hillary Clinton made it clear that she was willing to confront the Russians in every conceivable way, short of war, to make sure that they gave up Crimea. I think that is a really important point. In 2012, the Russians were very clearly hoping that Barack Obama would win and Mitt Romney would lose, because Romney was going around saying the Russians were the number one geopolitical threat and we have to be much more belligerent in confronting them, whereas Obama was saying that’s Cold War thinking and that we actually should try and get along with them a lot better. In Russian elections in the past, like when Boris Yeltsin was running, the U.S. wanted Boris Yeltsin to win, because they knew he would privatize U.S. [ sic ] industry in a way that would help U.S. companies, so they meddled in their election to help Yeltsin win. They meddled in 2012 to agitate anti-Russian protesters.
So, I think David is right. Hillary Clinton’s agenda, she was very critical of Obama for not confronting Putin in Ukraine, for not confronting Putin in Syria, for not doing more to sanction Russian oligarchs. And Obama’s position was actually closer to Trump’s, which was, “No, we should try and get along with Russia. We don’t want to provoke Putin unnecessarily. He’s a nuclear-armed power.” And he’s not that powerful over things like Ukraine and Syria, which are distant to the U.S. So, of course I think it’s rational that the Russians preferred the candidate saying, “Let’s get along with Russia,” to the candidate saying, “Let’s confront Russia more belligerently than Obama did.” That’s what the U.S. does, too. They interfere in other countries’ elections, including Russia, to help the candidate that will most help them.
But I am interested, David, in hearing your answer directly to the question of whether you are also angry, as angry as you are about Trump Jr. taking that meeting with the Russians, about the efforts to work with the Ukrainian government to dig up dirt about Paul Manafort and Donald Trump, as well as the use of Christopher Steele to dig up dirt by using his sources within the Russian government, the same Russian government with whom you say Trump worked, to dig up dirt about Donald Trump.
DAVID CAY JOHNSTON : Well, one of the differences between us, Glenn, is I’m not driven here at all by emotion. I don’t hate anybody. I’m not angry about anything. I deal in facts that I can prove and verify. And when the facts change, my view of events change. And, of course, we never have a perfect set of facts.
But I think that involvement—I said earlier—involvement by either party with foreign governments, we need better laws and rules about this. I don’t think the Foreign Agent Registration Act is sufficient. And I think it’s absolutely improper to be doing things that were done by—on both sides, by this. That’s one where I’ll agree with you about that. This Ukrainian information gathering is troubling. Opposition research goes on all the time, but there should be some rules and controls on that. And so, in all of this, let’s be very clear that Donald Trump was—
GLENN GREENWALD : So, does that mean that they’re not patriots?
DAVID CAY JOHNSTON : Well, I think that Donald Trump Jr.’s behavior was absolutely unpatriotic. Yes, I think that his failure to pick up the phone and call the FBI—
GLENN GREENWALD : What about the Democrats in working with Ukraine?
DAVID CAY JOHNSTON : I don’t—to be honest, I don’t enough about—
GLENN GREENWALD : And what about the Democrats working with Ukrainian government? Was that unpatriotic?
DAVID CAY JOHNSTON : Yeah, I don’t know enough about the details of that. I think that’s a very good question, Glenn. And I don’t know enough to give you sort of a definitive response to that. I’m very troubled by it on its face.
GLENN GREENWALD : Fair enough.
DAVID CAY JOHNSTON : OK?
GLENN GREENWALD : OK.
DAVID CAY JOHNSTON : So, but I think—you know, let’s remember here, Donald Trump was negotiating for a Trump Tower deal that would have put millions, maybe tens of millions, of dollars in his pocket, when he was running for president. He was lying and denying about various things. He publicly called for the Russians to hack—or, maybe that’s too strong a word—to find the, quote, “missing emails,” which weren’t missing at all. And within hours, Russian intelligence agents were working on doing that.
So, what we’ve seen, I think, is right in front of our eyes: inappropriate behavior, and behavior that shows that Donald Trump, in the most kind—as I’ve said before, the kindest thing you can say about Donald Trump is that he has divided loyalties. Donald Trump’s ultimate loyalty is only to Donald Trump. It is not to his oath of office. It is not to the country. At DCReport, we’ve been documenting all the things he’s doing that hurt the forgotten man, that he promised to be the champion of and who he is actively, aggressively working against in his administration. And you don’t lie, deny and cover up, unless you know you did something wrong.
AMY GOODMAN : Glenn, do you think that President Trump should be impeached over obstruction of justice? You have, what, Don McGahn quitting rather than firing Mueller, and, of course, President Trump fired Comey. But do you think, despite, you’ve always said, that this is not about collusion? You have 30 seconds.
GLENN GREENWALD : No, I don’t. And the reason I don’t is because—yeah, I don’t, because I think that the question was whether he was acting as a president in his right to stop an investigation that he knew was based on false allegations or whether he was trying to cover up his own wrongdoing. And once Mueller concluded that there was no evidence to establish the wrongdoing, I don’t think he had a corrupt motive. I think his motive was: “I think this investigation is garbage, and therefore I’m very open about the fact that I want to stop it.” And I don’t think that’s obstruction of justice. I think that’s just Donald Trump wanting to stop an investigation he believes never should have been launched in the first place.
AMY GOODMAN : And in five seconds, your thoughts on Donald Trump today?
GLENN GREENWALD : I mean, I think Donald Trump is a huge danger and menace to the republic for a lot of reasons that David is very adeptly covering, and I really hope that we can now turn our attention to those things, now that we’re done with this espionage thriller that has dominated us for three years. I hope we can focus on the things that matter.
AMY GOODMAN : We have to leave it there. Glenn Greenwald and David Cay Johnston, thanks so much. Up Next"
"Headlines for April 19, 2019",www.democracynow.org,mail@democracynow.org (Democracy Now!),04-19-2019,2019,4,https://www.democracynow.org/2019/4/19/headlines,"Mueller Report Shows No Trump-Russia Conspiracy But Leaves Open Question of Obstruction Apr 19, 2019
The Justice Department has released a redacted version of special counsel Robert Mueller’s report detailing Russian meddling in the 2016 election, the Trump campaign’s contacts with Russia and President Trump’s attempts to impede the special counsel’s investigation. The 448-page document states Trump’s campaign “expected it would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through Russian efforts,” but concluded, “the investigation did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.” The report reveals that when President Trump was first told of the special counsel’s investigation, he slumped back into his chair, proclaiming, “Oh my God. This is terrible. This is the end of my presidency. I’m fucked.” On Thursday, Trump responded to the report’s release.
President Donald Trump : “I’m having a good day, too. It was called no collusion, no obstruction.”
Mueller’s report outlined at least 10 instances where Trump tried to impede the special counsel’s investigation, but came to no definitive conclusion on whether Trump broke the law by obstructing justice. In the report, Mueller suggests that this is a decision for Congress. That contradicts the conclusion by Trump’s hand-picked attorney general, William Barr, who said Trump did not obstruct justice. House Judiciary Committee Chair Jerrold Nadler said he’d ask Robert Mueller to appear before Congress “as soon as possible.”
Rep. Jerrold Nadler : “I have formally requested that special counsel Mueller testify before the House Judiciary Committee as soon as possible, so we can get some answers to these critical questions, because we clearly can’t believe what Attorney General Barr tells us.”
Some lawmakers said the report offers a road map to Trump’s impeachment. Freshman Congressmember Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted, “Mueller’s report is clear in pointing to Congress’ responsibility in investigating obstruction of justice by the President. It is our job as outlined in Article 1, Sec 2, Clause 5 of the US Constitution. As such, I’ll be signing onto @RashidaTlaib’s impeachment resolution.” After headlines, we’ll spend the rest of the hour discussing the Mueller report and its implications with Pulitzer Prize-winning journalists David Cay Johnston and Glenn Greenwald. Trump Admin to Spend $40 Million on New Immigration Detention Camps Apr 19, 2019
The Trump administration is planning to spend $40 million to build a pair of tent cities to imprison migrant families—including children—in southern Texas. Kevin McAleenan said Wednesday the camps would be temporary, calling them part of a strategy to ease strain on Border Patrol agents in El Paso and at other U.S. ports of entry. Critics say the move is aimed at indefinitely detaining whole families in squalid conditions, in a further bid to deter migrants from seeking asylum in the U.S. Central American Migrants Claim Assault by Mexican Authorities Apr 19, 2019
In southern Mexico, authorities have halted a caravan of hundreds of Central American migrants from advancing north toward the U.S. border, where they hoped to seek asylum. The migrants were stopped in Chiapas by agents of the National Migration Institute, as Mexico’s government comes under intense pressure by the Trump administration to thwart attempts by asylum seekers to move north. This is Elizabeth, a Honduran mother of a 3-year-old boy who says she and her family were physically abused by Mexican authorities.
Elizabeth : “They came down on us as though we were criminals. From the beginning, we said that if we came, we came in peace. We have not made any fuss. We have not attacked anyone. How is it possible that now it’s the migration officials who came to attack us? What is this about? If they saw that my husband was carrying a child, why kick him and knock him down, knowing he’s got a child in his arms? What is wrong with them?” ACLU Warns of “Fascist Militia” Holding Migrant Border Crossers at Gunpoint Apr 19, 2019 Image Credit: YouTube: True Conservatives Minutes
The American Civil Liberties Union is warning that armed vigilantes are working directly with the U.S. Border Patrol to unlawfully detain hundreds of migrants at gunpoint along the U.S.-Mexico border. The ACLU cites videos posted on social media showing members of a militia group pursuing migrants in New Mexico’s desert west of El Paso, Texas, and effectively kidnapping them against their will. In one video, vigilantes armed with assault rifles are seen approaching a group of several dozen people seated on the ground, as the video’s narrator, a man named Jim Benvie, films.
Jim Benvie : “Hey, guys. This is Jim with the United Constitutional Patriots and We Build the Wall. … As you can see, we did actually end up getting everybody wound up. It was a combination of us and some good horses over there and basically a team effort here.”
In a letter to New Mexico’s governor and attorney general calling for an investigation, the ACLU called the United Constitutional Patriots an “armed fascist militia organization,” adding, “The Trump administration’s vile racism has emboldened white nationalists and fascists to flagrantly violate the law.” Nicaragua Bans Anti-Government Protests, Arresting Dozens Apr 19, 2019
In Nicaragua, police arrested dozens of protesters Wednesday as they took to the streets demanding that President Daniel Ortega step down. It’s been one year since anti-government protests erupted in Nicaragua. Human rights groups say at least 324 people have been killed in clashes involving anti-government demonstrators, police and pro-government militias. This week, Nicaragua’s government said it had released more than 600 prisoners as a gesture to opposition groups, but activists said only a small fraction of those released were political prisoners. Mali’s Government Resigns as Protesters Condemn Ethnic Violence Apr 19, 2019
Mali’s prime minister resigned Thursday along with his entire Cabinet, as public protests mounted over the government’s inability to stem ethnic violence. Last month, armed men killed 160 people from a Fulani community, as rights groups warned of mounting militia killings of civilians in central and northern Mali. The killings sparked mass demonstrations by thousands of protesters in Bamako earlier this month, demanding the government step down, as well as the departure of foreign forces from Mali. Sudan: Mass Protests Demand Civilian Rule After Omar al-Bashir’s Ouster Apr 19, 2019
In Sudan, hundreds of thousands of protesters continued to hold rallies in cities across the country on Thursday and Friday, calling for an end to military rule. The protests come as Sudan marks the one-week anniversary of longtime President Omar al-Bashir’s removal by top Sudanese generals amid a popular uprising against his 30-year rule. Since al-Bashir’s ouster, thousands of youth-led protesters have been holding a sit-in occupation of areas just outside the Ministry of Defense in the capital Khartoum. A military council has said it will oversee a transitional period of up to two years; the protesters are demanding the military quickly hand over power to a civilian-led government. The African Union is demanding the same thing or saying Sudan will have to leave the union. Al-Bashir is in the prison now where he sentenced so many to death. Bangladeshi Teen Burned to Death After Reporting Sexual Assault Apr 19, 2019
In Bangladesh, campaigners are demanding justice for Nusrat Jahan Rafi, a 19-year-old woman who was burned to death at her school after she filed a sexual assault complaint against her headmaster. In late March, Nusrat went to her local police station in her hometown south of the capital Dhaka to file a complaint. Her statement was filmed by a police officer on a cellphone, in a video that was later leaked to local media. In the video, taken on the day of the alleged assault, a visibly shaken Nusrat claimed the headmaster touched her in an inappropriate manner before she managed to escape his office. Five days after filing the complaint, Nusrat returned to her school, where she was surrounded by four or five people demanding she recant her testimony against the headmaster. When she refused, she was doused with kerosene and set on fire. She survived the assault long enough to give a statement to police, before succumbing to her injuries. The case has brought renewed attention to the plight of sexual assault survivors in Bangladesh and the impunity often granted to perpetrators of sexual violence. Saudi Court Suspends Hearing for 11 Women’s Rights Activists Who’ve Faced Torture Apr 19, 2019
A court In Saudi Arabia indefinitely postponed a hearing Wednesday for a group of 11 prominent women’s rights activists imprisoned on what human rights groups say are trumped-up charges. The women were arrested nearly one year ago as they campaigned against the kingdom’s male “guardianship” system and a ban on women drivers. Their arrests came just weeks before the kingdom lifted the ban. Among those arrested was 29-year-old Loujain al-Hathloul. Her brother Walid told the BBC Wednesday that his sister has been severely abused in Saudi custody.
Walid al-Hathloul : “All sorts of torture—electrocutions, waterboarding, sexual harassment. And this is actually done by Saud al-Qahtani, the top adviser of the crown prince. He was actually overseeing the torture at this secret facility, because when the torture was happening, that was happening at the secret facility outside Dhahban prison. And it was done in a basement. And that’s where he was laughing, he was threatening her with rape and murder.”
The latest reports of Saudi torture came after President Trump vetoed a War Powers Resolution calling on the U.S. to end military support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen, which has sparked the world’s worst humanitarian crisis. Journalist Lyra McKee Shot Dead Amid Northern Ireland Riots Apr 19, 2019
In Northern Ireland, a 29-year-old journalist was shot and killed Thursday as violent protests erupted in an Irish nationalist section of the city of Derry. Lyra McKee was a rising star of investigative journalism who published articles in The Atlantic, Mosaic Science and BuzzFeed. Investigators say they’re treating her death as a “terrorist incident” and have launched a murder inquiry. The riots broke out after a police raid that authorities said broke up a plot to stage attacks this weekend. They came just hours after U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi wrapped up a visit to Derry, where she led a congressional delegation that marked the anniversary of the U.S.-brokered 1998 peace deal known as the Good Friday Agreement. Florida Police Dept. to Investigate Officers Filmed Brutalizing Teenagers Apr 19, 2019 Image Credit: WPLG Local 10 News
In Florida, the Broward County Sheriff’s Department says it will probe the actions of officers caught on camera brutally assaulting teenagers after responding to a call about an after-school fight in a McDonald’s parking lot near their high school in Coral Springs. Viral video of the incident shows sheriff’s deputies pepper-spraying teenagers and slamming one boy’s head into the pavement before repeatedly punching him in the head. The boy was left bleeding heavily and was later rushed away in an ambulance. New York City Approves Climate Plan Meant to Curb Emissions from Big Buildings Apr 19, 2019
New York’s City Council has approved historic climate change legislation aimed at limiting greenhouse gas emissions from big buildings. Under the bill approved Thursday, most buildings larger than 25,000 square feet will need to cut carbon dioxide emissions by 40 percent by 2030, and by 80 percent by mid-century.

Meanwhile, hundreds of protesters rallied at New York City Hall Thursday evening and marched across the Brooklyn Bridge to demand a halt to the proposed Williams pipeline project, which would carry fracked gas from Pennsylvania’s shale fields under New York Harbor. Scores of elected officials have joined hundreds of environmental groups and tens of thousands of petitioners in opposing the plan. Governor Andrew Cuomo has until May 16 to halt the project. CIA Director Gina Haspel Confronted over Torture During Rare Public Appearance Apr 19, 2019 Image Credit: Twitter: @AuburnU
And CIA Director Gina Haspel made a rare public appearance Thursday, delivering a speech to students at Auburn University in Alabama that many described as a recruiting pitch for the spy agency. A few minutes into her speech, Haspel was interrupted by a protester—just after she described the thrill she felt when she was first sworn in as a CIA officer.
Protester : “Do you remember the thrill of the CIA black site that you tortured people in, and the evidence that you destroyed? Tell these young children. Tell them who you tortured. You know their names! They’re still in Guantánamo Bay!”
Haspel is a 33-year CIA veteran who was responsible for running a secret CIA black site in Thailand in 2002 where at least one prisoner was waterboarded and tortured in other ways during her tenure. She also oversaw the destruction of videotapes showing torture at the black site.

In Nicaragua, police arrested dozens of protesters Wednesday as they took to the streets demanding that President Daniel Ortega step down. It’s been one year since anti-government protests erupted in Nicaragua. Human rights groups say at least 324 people have been killed in clashes involving anti-government demonstrators, police and pro-government militias. This week, Nicaragua’s government said it had released more than 600 prisoners as a gesture to opposition groups, but activists said only a small fraction of those released were political prisoners.

Kevin McAleenan said Wednesday the camps would be temporary, calling them part of a strategy to ease strain on Border Patrol agents in El Paso and at other U.S. ports of entry. Critics say the move is aimed at indefinitely detaining whole families in squalid conditions, in a further bid to deter migrants from seeking asylum in the U.S. The original content of this program is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-No Derivative Works 3.0 United States License .

NERMEEN SHAIKH : Before dawn on Monday morning, hundreds of police in riot gear raided the Occupy Oakland encampment in order to evict peaceful protesters. It was the second time the police had evicted protesters. A similar raid was conducted on October 25th. On Monday, more than 30 people who chose to remain as an act of civil disobedience were arrested. Later in the day, Mayor Jean Quan’s chief legal adviser resigned over what he called the, quote, “tragically unnecessary” police raid.
AMY GOODMAN : I visited the campment on Sunday, prior to the raid. It was a peaceful Sunday morning. One of the people who happened to be right in front of Oakland City Hall at the Occupy Oakland encampment talked about why he was there.
ALI : My name is Ali. How are you all doing?
AMY GOODMAN : Hi. Have you been here from the beginning?
ALI : Pretty much. Pretty much, yeah.
AMY GOODMAN : And what do you want to see happen here?
ALI : Well, there’s a lot of things. You know, I’m from Oakland, you know what I’m saying? So that, for me, to see changes, it’s not a Wall Street thing, it’s not a bank thing, but it’s a social thing. You know what I’m saying? Everything that’s been going on in Oakland—the homicides, schools being closed down, libraries being shut down, teachers being cut off, public workers getting laid off, work furloughs—everything that the city is supposed to be taking care of its own is not being done. You know, that’s what I’m here, is trying to get them to start taking care of us as a people in Oakland, California. I mean, this is minute. You know, this is a small thing right now, if you look at it from Oakland’s perspective, OK? But this is not small: we are a role model for the whole world. And that’s what’s going on.
AMY GOODMAN : And how are the police dealing with this at this point?
ALI : Can I—can I be frank? I don’t care. I want to say it in different words, you know, but I just—I don’t care, you know, what the police think. I don’t care what Mayor Quan think. I don’t think what any politician think about what we’re doing here, because what we’re doing here is starting something new, you know what I’m saying? I don’t deal with any type of politic situations or none of that. What I’m dealing with is this encampment of Oscar Grant Plaza, OK? That’s the only thing. That’s the only my concern.
AMY GOODMAN : And why is it called Oscar Grant Plaza?
ALI : I mean, you know, it’s a representation of what’s been going on in Oakland, California, for a long time, with the oppression of poverty here, of the people of the community of Oakland, OK? Oscar Grant was a young male who was pretty much handcuffed on a BART train with a 250-pound officer on his back, six-four, OK? While he had another officer on his neck. And the officer pretty much pulled a gun and shot him in the back, while he was still in handcuffs, laying down on the platform on his stomach. So how—I don’t understand the threat in that, OK? And that’s the threat of these corporations on our society and our community. It represents that. We are all in handcuffs. We are all on our back. We have no way of getting out of it. And they pretty much have got these guns on our back, and they’re shooting us. It’s a representation of a whole.
AMY GOODMAN : And what do you think this encampment has accomplished? How long has it been out here?
ALI : I mean, you know, this encampment has accomplished a lot, OK, for myself and—you know, we have discussions all the time, you know what I’m saying? And it comes to what society labels us as, you know? And this right here, this encampment, has given the people a chance to change what those labels are, you know what I’m saying? Whether you’ve been called a black man who’s a criminal or a Hispanic who’s a car thief or an individual who’s a racist, this is a place where none of that exists, OK? Because if you come with those, you’re going to have some type of change. OK?
And pretty much what I’ve seen happen here, because this is our own world, our own community, our own society, that’s by the people, we feed people, OK? We house people, OK? Not just people, but families, as well, you know what I’m saying? These people, if you go around West Oakland, the homeless encampments all across West Oakland are pretty much here. They are a part of the society, and they have to be recognized that they are here. You know what I’m saying? But everybody here is not a homeless individual. Some of us are hard-working class. You got these homeless people, crack addicts, heroine addicts, disabled people, right along with the same people that are doctors, lawyers, practitioners, chiropractors, teachers. We’re all here together, OK? We are parents. We are mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters. Everything here is together, no matter what label you put on us. You know?
I’m a criminal. I’m a thug. I’m a convict. I’m a gangster. I’m a womanizer. But you know what? That’s what society labeled me as. This society—I’m not none of those. I just met these people right here, you know? I just met you guys. Do you guys consider me as a thug or a criminal or anything?
UNIDENTIFIED : No.
ALI : There we go. You know what I’m saying? And that’s what’s been going on in society is that we have these labels upon ourself, living in these low-income areas. And pretty much like I was saying is that we need to start showing the people.
AMY GOODMAN : That was Ali at Occupy Oakland on Sunday morning. Within 24 hours, the encampment was raided, scores of people arrested.
Oakland Mayor Jean Quan admitted in an interview with the BBC that she and leaders across various cities around the country experiencing Occupy protests, well, participated in a conference call.
MAYOR JEAN QUAN : I was recently on a conference call of 18 cities across the country who had the same situation, where what had started as a political movement and a political encampment ended up being an encampment that was no longer in control of the people who started them. And what I think you’re starting to see is that the Occupy movement is looking for more stability. I spent a lot of last week talking to peaceful demonstrators, ones who wanted to separate themselves in my city away from the anarchist groups who had been looking for a confrontation with the police.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : Well, as police forces violently crack down on protesters across the United States and Europe, we turn now to an author who looks at the increasing influence of military technology on domestic police forces. Stephen Graham is professor of Cities and Society at Newcastle University in the U.K. His book, Cities Under Siege: The New Military Urbanism , looks at the links between military counterinsurgency tactics deployed in war zones abroad and the methods of surveillance and control increasingly used in urban areas around the world.
Stephen Graham, welcome to Democracy Now! Could you say a little bit about what the significance of your findings in the book were regarding the Occupy movements, in the U.S. particularly?
STEPHEN GRAHAM : Yes, well, the book really tries to look at the ways in which police forces are increasingly using sort of military ideas and military tactics at the domestic scale to confront particularly mobilizations in cities, such as the Occupy movements that we’re talking about here, and how those tactics and ideas and, increasingly, technologies have very close links, very big security-industrial complexes, to the moves in the military towards a really intense focus on cities and on counterinsurgency tactics in sort of war zone cities such as Baghdad and Kabul.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : In a CNN article that appeared yesterday, the author talks to a police officer who reports that now the kind of equipment that’s accessible to the police includes machine guns, tasers, and also that larger and mid-sized police departments in the U.S. now have access to tanks. Can you say something about how this happened?
STEPHEN GRAHAM : Well, there’s been a longstanding shift in North America and Europe towards paramilitarized policing, using helicopter-style systems, using infrared sensing, using really, really heavy militarized weaponry. That’s been longstanding, fueled by the war on drugs and other sort of explicit campaigns. But more recently, there’s been a big push since the end of the Cold War by the big defense and security and IT companies to sell things like video surveillance systems, things like geographic mapping systems, and even more recently, drone systems, that have been used in the assassination raids in Afghanistan and in Pakistan and elsewhere, as sort of a domestic policing technology. It’s basically a really big, booming market, particularly in a world where surveillance and security is being integrated into buildings, into cities, into transport systems, on the back of the war on terror.
AMY GOODMAN : And then, talk about the issue of surveillance, whether we’re talking about how the Occupy movements are being watched, surveilled, monitored. Very interesting to hear Oakland Mayor Jean Quan say on the BBC that they’re coordinating—and they are coordinating with the FBI , they’re coordinating with Homeland Security—in dealing with these movements. So, talk about the surveillance apparatus, something you know very well from Britain, and name names. What are the corporations involved?
STEPHEN GRAHAM : Well, there’s a whole variety of corporations linked to university research departments, linked to large-scale data-mining companies, linked to companies like Raytheon, who most people know of as making missile systems. Increasingly, they run border surveillance systems for things like the airline security and so on, which is a big thing in Europe and North America. But the key point really here is that surveillance is being used to try and track activist groups, permanently sort of monitoring them, using video systems, using database systems, and to allow infiltration. These are very much seen as movements that need to be infiltrated. In the U.K., there’s been a big scandal because of undercover police going into activist movements across Europe—green movements, social movements and so on—with a view to sort of basically being informers and spies to allow police to sort of crack down on what is effectively completely legitimate democratic activity.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : What do you think the significance is, Stephen Graham, of the fact that protesters across the U.S.—and it’s been true in Europe, as well—are increasingly characterized as somehow criminal—drug addicts or sexual predators—or somehow a sanitation or a health hazard to the communities in which they’re protesting? Can you say a little bit about how this works?
STEPHEN GRAHAM : Well, in the book and elsewhere—other authors are writing these things, too—I think it’s important to put this debate in the bigger context of how cities have changed. And cities in the last 20 or 30 years, particularly in North America, have become much more sanitized, much more controlled by questions of zero tolerance, by questions of really aggressive policing, to clear out those that are deemed to be sort of not fitting a model of urban life, which centers on consumption, which centers on business. So there’s been a really powerful shift in cities to sort of criminalize homelessness, to criminalize panhandlers, to criminalize those not seen to belong in this—what Neil Smith in New York has called the “revanchist city,” the city taking back spaces for the wealthy, effectively. That was very much Mayor Giuliani’s strategy.
So, in a way, I think what the Occupy movement is so powerful at is demonstrating that by occupying public spaces around the world, and particularly these extremely symbolic public spaces, it’s reasserting that the city is the foundation space for democracy. And we have to reassert that symbolically and with the actual groupings of the activists in space. So the internet is not enough. It’s very much necessary to reassert that cities are political spaces which need to be used to mobilize social and political change.
AMY GOODMAN : And you talk about how the population centers have so dramatically shifted, not only in the United States, but around the world, to the cities. And it’s that question we’ll end with, Stephen Graham.
STEPHEN GRAHAM : Absolutely. Well, I mean, last year, we moved past the moment where 50 percent of the world was living in cities. By 2050, 75 percent of the world’s population will be living in cities. But too often, political and military power is controlled by people who see cities purely as threats, purely as sites of unrest, sites that need strong military and security control. And what’s so wonderful about the Occupy protests is that there’s a different, a much more hopeful idea of cities being pushed there, in a world where we have a really radical crisis and a radical sense of illegitimacy for the social model that we’re all still having to live under.

In London, climate activists with the Extinction Rebellion group chained and superglued themselves to the home of U.K. Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn Wednesday, as part of a third day of direct action protests aimed at spurring urgent action on climate change. Many of the protesters said they supported Corbyn but wanted his party to declare a national climate emergency. Elsewhere in London, protesters continued to occupy the busy Oxford Circus shopping district and superglued themselves to a train, delaying service. Topics:"

At the Vatican, 16-year-old Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg was greeted by Pope Francis Wednesday, as she continues to lead a campaign to press European leaders to act urgently on climate change. Last August, Thunberg began a series of school strikes on the climate outside the Swedish parliament, which quickly grew from a quiet, one-person weekly vigil to an international protest movement involving hundreds of thousands of schoolchildren. On Tuesday, Thunberg addressed the European Parliament, where she urged lawmakers to respond as urgently to climate change as they did when much of Paris’s Notre-Dame cathedral burned on Monday.
Greta Thunberg : “Yesterday, the world watched with despair and enormous sorrow how the Notre-Dame burnt in Paris. Some buildings are more than just buildings. But the Notre-Dame will be rebuilt. I hope that its foundations are strong. I hope that our foundations are even stronger, but I fear they are not.” Topics:"

AMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! I’m Amy Goodman. Millions around the world are celebrating Earth Day today, following a week of enormous climate activism here in the U.S. and abroad. In the United Kingdom, nearly 1,000 people have been arrested after a week of actions, as demonstrators with the group Extinction Rebellion shut down bridges and streets, occupied public landmarks, superglued themselves to trains and the Shell Oil headquarters, and rallied across London to demand radical action on climate change. On Sunday, 16-year-old Swedish activist Greta Thunberg addressed a crowd of thousands at London’s Marble Arch.
GRETA THUNBERG : We are now facing an existential crisis, the climate crisis and ecological crisis, which have never been treated as crisis before. They have been ignored for decades. And for way too long, the politicians and the people in power have gotten away with not doing anything at all to fight the climate crisis and the ecological crisis. But we will make sure that they will not get away with it any longer.
AMY GOODMAN : Last week, Greta Thunberg met with the pope.
Back in the U.S., hundreds of protesters rallied at New York City Hall and marched across the Brooklyn Bridge Thursday to demand a halt to the proposed Williams pipeline project, which would carry fracked gas from Pennsylvania’s shale fields under the New York Harbor. President Trump signed two executive orders earlier this month to facilitate the approval of pipeline projects, limiting states’ ability to regulate such projects, the moves intended in part to clear the way for permitting on the northeastern Constitution pipeline, which has stalled after New York invoked the Clean Water Act to reject the project on environmental grounds. This comes as climate activists have filed a federal lawsuit with the ACLU challenging three South Dakota laws that they say violate the First Amendment rights of anti-pipeline organizers.
Earlier this month, Nermeen Shaikh and I sat down with an organizer with Indigenous Environmental Network. He is Dallas Goldtooth, Dakota and Diné, who’s one of the plaintiffs in the ACLU lawsuit. I started by asking him to respond to Trump’s executive orders.
DALLAS GOLDTOOTH : What we’re seeing right now with these executive orders is nothing but an act of aggression against the authority for states to protect their homelands or protect the residents of their state and the lands within the borders of those states, mainly targeting the Clean Water Act. Really, what Trump wants to do is take away the states’ abilities to enforce environmental regulations against pipeline projects or other infrastructure, fossil fuel projects, and take and give that power solely to the federal government. You know, this is—it’s kind of absurd that, you know, Trump, being a representative or the figurehead of the Republican Party, is wholeheartedly endorsing an ideology that the federal government has a final say over what happens within the borders of a state and that the state has very little recourse to address these issues. The other—there are just two executive orders, so that was the first one.
The second one really specifically talked—focuses on the cross-border—the border crossing of pipelines. In this regard, we’re talking about Keystone XL. I know Enbridge, Enbridge Line 3, was also one of those pipelines that had to deal with crossing the border from Canada to transport tar sands oil. And really what the president is trying to do, and he did this a couple weeks ago by approving Keystone XL a second time, is saying that he, as the president, has the sole power to approve these projects, and is encouraging the State Department to say—to act only as advisers to the president to sign these projects.
And there’s something really—something really insidious and dangerous about this, that is just a part, a continuing part, of Trump’s legacy for overreaching his executive powers, is that the president has stated that because he is the president, he is not a federal agency, therefore he’s not beholden to any environmental regulations that federal agencies have to follow, in particular the National Environmental Protection Act, parts of the Clean Water Act. You know, he’s saying that, “As the president, I actually am—I don’t have to follow those, because I’m not a federal agency.” And that’s very, very dangerous precedent to start here, especially as we look towards a rapid expansion of fossil fuel development in this country at this current moment and what we’re trying to fight against in the protection of Mother Earth and the sacredness of the land itself.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : And, Dallas Goldtooth, could you talk about, in fact, some of the efforts that states have been making to resist, block these pipelines, in Pennsylvania, for example, and elsewhere?
DALLAS GOLDTOOTH : Yeah. Over the past decade, we’ve seen a lot of states become more aware about the dangers of fossil fuel infrastructure projects and the risks that they pose to drinking water and to clean air. I think, on the big picture, we’re seeing a greater understanding about how these projects lock us into more fossil fuel development, and therefore add to the climate chaos that we’re seeing with the increase of greenhouse gas emissions. And so you’re seeing some states, like Pennsylvania or even New York, who are taking steps to address that by putting moratoriums on fracking development or having a more stringent process or a more stringent evaluation of pipeline projects and their impacts, whether it’s very specific or cumulative impacts on climate overall. And one of those examples that the president has referenced specifically is how New York state has used the Clean Water Act to to halt the continuation of the Constitution pipeline in that area.
On the flip side, we’re also seeing states who are trying their very hardest to increase fossil fuel development in their areas. And one way that they’re doing that is to suppress the ability for common, everyday citizens to publicly protest against them or to use their First Amendment rights to speak out against these projects’ impacts on their communities.
AMY GOODMAN : Last month, the Rainforest Action Network, along with a coalition of environmental groups, including your group, the Indigenous Environmental Network, released its annual fossil fuel finance report card called “Banking on Climate Change.” The report showed that 33 of the world’s largest banks have financed $1.9 trillion into fossil fuels since the Paris Agreement was signed in 2016. Michigan Democratic Congressmember Rashida Tlaib referenced the report as she questioned CEOs from the nation’s largest banks Wednesday at a congressional hearing called “Holding Megabanks Accountable.”
REP . RASHIDA TLAIB : A report released two weeks ago shows that fossil fuel lending and underwriting is dominated by big U.S. banks, four of which are sitting right here in front of us. Chase, Wells Fargo, Citi, as well as Bank of America are top four banks in the world financing fossil fuel industry. Mr. Dimon, your bank alone has provided more than $195 billion in fossil fuel lending and underwriting over the past three years, since signing of the Paris climate agreement, making your bank the number one funder of fossil fuels in the world. Citi, Mr Corbat, has provided more than $129 billion in fossil fuel funding over the past three years, number three in the world. Mr Moynihan, Bank of America has provided more than $106 billion in fossil fuel funding over the past three years, making it number four in the world.
I want folks—don’t say that you’re committed to clean and sustainable financing, because your companies’ words are not consistent with your actions. I would call this gaslighting. That’s kind of what we call it in the neighborhood. But for the sake of this hearing, I’ll say that you are greenwashing your own track record in duping the American people into believing that you are helping address climate change. On the record, will any of your banks make a commitment to phase out your investments in fossil fuels and dirty energy and align your investments with the goals of Paris climate agreement, to help protect our planet and communities I grew up in? That goes to all of you, if you guys can answer that. Mr Corbat?
MICHAEL CORBAT : We have—we are in the business of supporting fossil fuel companies, many of which are U.S.-based companies.
AMY GOODMAN : That’s Michael L. Corbat, CEO of Citigroup, responding to that question from Michigan Congressmember Rashida Tlaib. Dallas Goldtooth, overall, your response to what she is raising?
DALLAS GOLDTOOTH : You could hear a penny drop in that room when she asked that question. You know, she raised a great point, based on the report that I, again, was a part of. That was the fossil fuel financial report that was put out. You know, at the top of the list—I mean, what that report does is it lists the top banks who are financing fossil fuel production—or, fossil fuel expansion across the globe. And JPMorgan Chase is at the very top of that. Wells Fargo comes in a close second. The top leading banks in the United States are all heavily invested in fossil fuels. And that’s why we are leading a major divestment campaign, to make sure that we are holding these banks accountable.
AMY GOODMAN : That’s Dallas Goldtooth, Diné and Dakota activist, organizer with the Indigenous Environmental Network. To hear the whole conversation with Dallas, you can go to democracynow.org.

Climate activists are calling it one of the largest acts of civil disobedience in French history. The blockade also successfully targeted French oil giant Total; Société Générale, an investment bank that funds dirty energy projects; and a state-run electric utility that relies heavily on nuclear power.

AMY GOODMAN : We begin today’s show in Sri Lanka, where government officials say a local Islamist extremist group called the National Thowheed Jama’ath carried out a series of eight bombings on Easter Sunday at Catholic churches and luxury hotels throughout Sri Lanka. The attacks killed at least 290 people, injured more than 500 and left behind scenes of carnage and chaos. Sri Lankan police have arrested 24 people in connection with the attacks. Today, Monday, another bomb exploded in a van near a church, where scores were killed the previous day, as bomb squad officials were trying to defuse it. This comes as many residents are still searching for their loved ones from Sunday’s attacks.
SRI LANKAN RESIDENT : [translated] She went to church yesterday. We kept calling her after we heard of the incident, but there was no response. We didn’t hear from her, even in the night. That is why we came here first thing in the morning.
AMY GOODMAN : The round of attacks on Sunday hit busy Easter services at churches in the heart of Sri Lanka’s minority Christian community in the cities of Colombo and Negombo and Batticaloa. Bombs also exploded in three luxury hotels in the capital city of Colombo: the Shangri-La, the Cinnamon Grand and the Kingsbury. Another blast hit a hotel near the zoo, and a final blast struck a private house in Dematagoda during a raid in connection with the attacks, officials said. Three police officers were killed.
Sri Lanka’s president said, in a statement, that, quote, “international organizations” were behind what he called, quote, “acts of local terrorists.” The statement also said the government would implement anti-terrorism measures that give additional powers to police. Sri Lanka’s health minister spoke Monday about the death toll.
RAJITHA SENARATNE : Nearly 300 people have died. Over 500 people have been injured, severely injured. Some are disabled. So, we are very, very, very sorry, as a government, we have to say. And we have to apologize to the families and the other institutions about this incident.
AMY GOODMAN : The government’s apology comes amidst questions about whether more preventative measures could have been taken. Sri Lanka’s telecommunications minister said a government memo circulated by Sri Lanka’s top police official 10 days earlier warned of a possible attack, but that the warning was ignored.
After the eight explosions on Sunday, Sri Lankan officials forced the country of 21 million people to go on a dawn-to-dusk curfew. Officials also blocked a number of social media networks in the wake of the terrorist attacks, including Facebook and WhatsApp, as well as YouTube, Instagram, Snapchat.
Sunday’s violence comes after a decade of relative peace in Sri Lanka following the end of the 25-year civil war in 2009.
We hope to be going first to the Sri Lankan capital of Colombo. We are trying to reach Bhavani Fonseka, senior researcher with the Centre for Policy Alternatives. The phone lines have been difficult, but we’re going to see if we have her on the line right now.
Thank you so much for joining us. Can you describe what’s happening in the capital, Bhavani Fonseka?
BHAVANI FONSEKA : Thank you for having me. As we speak, there seems to have been another explosion in Colombo today, near where one of the explosions happened yesterday, in Kochchikade. So there continues to be security risks and uncertainty in Colombo and across Sri Lanka.
What happened yesterday, the multiple attacks, also is unprecedented. And it comes 10 years after the end of the war. So, it’s a very novel situation for many. And the coordinated attacks at the same time has now cost nearly 300 lives, possibly more. We don’t know at the moment, but it’s had a high casualty number, as well as many others injured. So, the situation in Colombo is very uncertain. And with the security situation as we speak, explosions happening, we really don’t know where things stand at the moment.
AMY GOODMAN : So, explain exactly what you understand, Bhavani, has happened and who this local group is that many, including the government, say could not possibly have carried out this massive level of attacks, eight different explosions now, almost 300 people dead. It’s being called one of the worst terrorist attacks in South Asia.
BHAVANI FONSEKA : So, what happened yesterday, on Easter Sunday, was these eight attacks—three in churches, three in major hotels in Sri Lanka, in Colombo, the hotels—and this actually created a lot of fears, because people really had no idea. And it came at a time where there was no information in terms of security threats. Since the attacks have happened, the prime minister has gone on record and given a press conference, and today there were several other ministers in government who spoke to the media. And what has transpired is that the intelligence had actually informed of security threats a few days ago, but, according to the prime minister and some other ministers, they were not informed. So there is a huge issue of a lapse in security as to why measures were not taken.
According to the government, also they now claim there’s a particular group that seems to be associated. Now, this is going on what the government has said. I think we need to be a bit more careful in terms of what really this real situation is. But several arrests have taken place. And what we are seeing now is more surveillance, more questioning happening. And the explosion today was also in terms of a suspicious vehicle, and they actually found more explosives.
So, again, this is, as I said, a very new situation in Sri Lanka. We haven’t seen this kind of violence for over a decade. But the coordinated nature of it and from the statements made by the government, they seem to indicate it’s a local group but with possible foreign links. And this is something that we will have to see how it plays out and what more information comes to the public.
AMY GOODMAN : So, last year, there were attacks on mosques and Muslim communities by Sinhala Buddhist nationalists. That was last year. What happened there? And now talk about this targeting, which looks like—I mean, the three churches were Catholic.
BHAVANI FONSEKA : Yes. So, last year, and not just last year, the recent past, we’ve seen several incidents of ethno-religious violence where religious minorities have come under attack, and places of religious worship, from mosques to churches, have come under attack. This is not the first time a church has been attacked, but this is the largest attack. So there’s been other incidents where places of worship have come under attack.
What happened in March 2018 was in—outside of Colombo, there were different areas where the Muslim community, which is a religious minority, came under attack by extremist Sinhala Buddhist forces. There were arrests that happened with those incidents, but, to date, we have not seen anyone being prosecuted for the violence that was unleashed over a year ago. So there’s a concern in terms of accountability and whether there were actually investigations that really led to justice. Even as recent as a couple of days ago, there was a place of religious worship, a Methodist prayer center, that came under attack by Sinhala nationalist forces. There’s reported that it’s linked to a particular political group.
So these incidents are not new. It’s not isolated. It’s the scale and the coordinated nature that is new. And so, you know, there is a history. We’ve had nearly a three-decade war, but the conflicts have remained. What we’ve seen postwar, since 2009, is more increased attacks on ethno-religious lines. So, there’s a serious concern as to what the recent spate of attacks mean, the terrorist angle and the responses so far, or the lack of it. And these are the main concerns at the moment.
AMY GOODMAN : If you can explain, Bhavani Fonseka—there’s been a long history of identity-based violence, although 2009, largely, the violence between the Sinhalese and the Tamil minority, that came to—largely, came to an end. Can you give us that history?
BHAVANI FONSEKA : So, Sri Lanka has had decades of tensions, discrimination, violence. And this predates the conflict, the war, which commenced in 1983. And in 2009, the war came to a brutal end, in May 2009. And in a few weeks, we actually mark 10 years since the end of the war. But the discrimination, the targeting and the ethnic tensions have been there for decades. This was most evident during the war, but this has continued postwar, as well. So, it was ethnic, on the ethnic lines, for several decades, but now we see tensions, threats, violence on the religious lines, as well, and largely the religious minorities coming under severe attack. Financial, there’s economic interests of minorities coming under attack, so there has been several businesses also attacked.
But, unfortunately, as I said, the violence, the impunity has continued, because there has been very limited action to hold the perpetrators to account. And successive governments, not just the present government, successive governments have promised action, promised to address the ethnic question, promised a political solution, promised accountability, truth, but nothing has really materialized. So, the more recent spate of attacks and yesterday’s and today’s incidents really begs the question whether these incidents can be resolved. I feel it’s a new stage we are entering, because of the nature of the attacks we’ve seen in the last 36 hours. So, many, many more questions than answers at the present moment.
AMY GOODMAN : And can you talk about the shutting down of social media, Bhavani, the history of the use of this media? The government shut down WhatsApp. It shut down Facebook and a number of other platforms. Why?
BHAVANI FONSEKA : So, even in March 2018, the government shut down certain platforms, so, as we speak, WhatsApp, Facebook, Viber, several others are not accessible for those living in Sri Lanka. And this we saw in March, as well. And the rationale being that they were trying to contain the violence, the misinformation being spread. And this was—in 2018, we saw the block on certain social media platforms happening for a couple of days.
Now, in Sri Lanka, the violence happened at 8:45, or around that time, yesterday morning, Easter Sunday, and the block commenced a few hours later, and it’s still ongoing. There’s no word as to when this block would be lifted. So, the rationale from the government is that they need to monitor; they need to contain violence; they don’t want to spread hate and misinformation. So we will have to see how this is going to play out. But a worrying announcement today is that the government is going to bring a state of emergency in Sri Lanka. And we have a history of emergency during the war. Even last year we saw a few days where emergency was imposed. And this could lead to further restrictions, in communication, in terms of movement. And again, something we would have to see as to how this plays out.
AMY GOODMAN : We were going to have you on a live shot in Colombo. You had gotten in your car. But just explain the scene in Colombo right now. You ultimately could not make your way there in downtown Colombo.
BHAVANI FONSEKA : Yes, unfortunately. I was going to meet with some of your colleagues at a location near one of the sites which was attacked yesterday, which is just outside of Colombo, St. Anthony’s Church in Kochchikade. Your colleagues were there, and I was on my way there, when the second explosion happened. And access to that area has been now restricted, and no one can actually go in. And footage on local TV, local media, shows that there was an explosive device they found, and that’s why the area was cordoned off.
So, as I said at the very outset, it’s a very dynamic situation on the ground. A curfew was imposed yesterday. It was lifted in the morning. They now have announced curfew will be imposed again in a few hours’ time. So, between curfew and emergency being brought in, I think it captures some of the security concerns. But at a large issue of civil liberties rights, there are also concerns as to how those would be handled and whether it will be a measured response or whether this would lead to further panic and confusion.
AMY GOODMAN : Bhavani Fonseka, I want to thank you for being with us, senior researcher at the Centre for Policy Alternatives in Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Stay safe.
This is Democracy Now! When we come back, we speak with a former Tamil political prisoner, a well-known international human rights researcher now, T. Kumar, as well as Alan Keenan with the International Crisis Group. Stay with us.

AMY GOODMAN : Lang Lang, performing Schumann. This is Democracy Now! I’m Amy Goodman, as we continue to look at the situation in Sri Lanka, where government officials say a local Islamist extremist group called the National Thowheed Jama’ath carried out a series of eight bombings on Easter Sunday at churches and luxury hotels throughout Sri Lanka. The attacks killed nearly 300 people, injuring more than 500, leaving behind carnage and chaos. Sri Lankan police have now arrested about 24 people in connection with the attacks. Pope Francis condemned the attacks during his traditional Easter Sunday message at the Vatican.
POPE FRANCIS : [translated] Dear brothers and sisters, I learned with sadness the news of the serious attacks that today, Easter Day, brought mourning and pain to some churches and other places where people were gathered in Sri Lanka. I wish to express my affection and closeness to the Christian community, hit while it was gathered in prayer, and to all the victims of such cruel violence. I entrust in the lord those who have tragically died. And I pray for the wounded and for all those who are suffering as a result of this dramatic event.
AMY GOODMAN : After the eight explosions Sunday, Sri Lankan officials forced the country of 21 million to go on a dawn-to-dusk curfew. Curfew is going to hit in a few hours from this broadcast today. Officials also blocked social media networks in the wake of the terrorist attacks—these terrorist attacks, the worst South Asia has seen.
For more, we’re joined in London by Alan Keenan, Sri Lanka project director at the International Crisis Group.
Thanks so much for being with us. Can you put this in a global context? Alan Keenan, were you shocked by what took place, this Easter Day massacre in Sri Lanka?
ALAN KEENAN : Yes. Well, I think everyone was shocked. These are horrific attacks. And they’ve, rightfully, been condemned by everybody, you know, all over the world. And they really caught, I think, Sri Lanka by surprise there. As my friend Bhavani, just before me, was saying, they’re unprecedented even by Sri Lanka’s long history; you know, even relative to its long history of political violence, these are atrocious attacks.
But I think your question is a good one, because I think they’re not only unprecedented in their scale and the number of attacks in a single day and the levels of organization, but for those reasons, I think—but they’re also unprecedented in the sense that the Muslim community has never struck back at any other community in Sri Lanka, and despite, as Bhavani was saying, the last five, six years of sort of a sustained attack on the community by militants who say they’re defending Buddhism from the threat of Islamic extremism. So, until yesterday, there was really no tangible evidence of any threat of violent extremism.
And I think there are a lot of questions about to what extent those—assuming, again, that the police investigations are uncovering the real facts and that what they’ve uncovered so far is true, they’re wondering—a lot of people, I think, are wondering about whether the Sri Lankan Muslims who have been arrested were actually acting on their own or to what degree, as the government has suggested, they were working with some other kind of international organization or network. So, I think that’s one of the big questions, I think, that’s still to be sorted out.
AMY GOODMAN : Have you heard of this local group?
ALAN KEENAN : Not by name. So, National Thowheed Jama’ath is not an organization, I think, anybody really had heard of, other than perhaps some—the police, apparently, 10 days ago, had heard of them. There’s another organization called Sri Lanka Thowheed Jama’ath, which has been in the news and is a Salafi organization known for its violent rhetoric and very aggressive anti-Buddhist and anti-Christian rhetoric at times, but not known for its physical violence.
This group named now as National Thowheed Jama’ath appears to be sort of part of the same or an aspect of or a name for a group that attacked some Buddha statues in December of last year in the central town of Mawanella. And that was really the first act of any violence whatsoever against Buddhists by Muslims, to my knowledge, in Sri Lanka. And it seemed like a local and isolated event. But police investigations, a few weeks later, linked that group of young men, who were apparently responsible for those attacks on Buddha statues, linked them to a discovery of an arms cache in the northwest of the island.
And that was the first inkling that perhaps there was some kind of a local Islamist, jihadi-type organization at work. But even then it seemed relatively modest by Sri Lankan standards, the threat. So I think what emerged yesterday is really shocking in its scale and has caught everyone by surprise.
AMY GOODMAN : We’re also joined by T. Kumar, former international advocacy director for Amnesty International USA . Kumar was a political prisoner for over five years in his native Sri Lanka. He was adopted as a prisoner of conscience, and initiated a worldwide campaign, Amnesty did, for his release. He began his legal studies there, became a lawyer, devoted his entire practice to defending political prisoners. T. Kumar, it’s great to have you back on Democracy Now! Can you respond to what’s happened in your native land, in Sri Lanka?
T. KUMAR : As Alan said, the scale and the way things have happened is new and took all of us by surprise. There are two aspects to it. One is, the ethnic conflict that lasted for 30 years and came to an end about 10 years ago is totally different from what happened yesterday, Easter Sunday. What happened yesterday was, allegedly, a Muslim extremist group have targeted Christian, prominent Christian, churches on a holiest day, to launch an attack. So, the conflict between Muslims and Buddhists was there for a couple of years now, but we never heard of conflict between Muslims and Christians to this extent. There may be some very low-level tensions in certain parts of the world. Both are minorities, by the way: Muslims are around 10% of the population; Christians are about 6% of the population.
So this is basically a target of Christians. It’s more than the local angle. You know, if there is a local issue, then definitely this group would have attacked Buddhist temples. But they have attacked Catholic and Christian churches. It shows that it is more than the local issue; it’s more about international. So, that’s something. I am sure the Sri Lankan officials are looking into it. That’s why I think Sri Lankan authorities are saying that this have an international angle to it.
AMY GOODMAN : What are you concerned about right now, T. Kumar, in how this plays out? And you have the Sri Lankan government apologizing. Apparently, this memo came out. There were warnings at the beginning of April, then mid-April, then apparently 10 minutes before the attack. The government has apologized for not heeding these warnings. Now they’ve shut down social media, much of social media. And if you can also talk about the role of social media?
T. KUMAR : Yeah, the role of social media, like anywhere else in the world, is a double-edged sword. So, during the attack against Muslims about a year ago, social media played a major role in—basically, that created more tensions. So the Sri Lankan government shut down social media at that time. So it’s a standard, routine security procedure that Sri Lankan security forces are doing when they see a nature of this attack.
There is also another reason—it’s the most important one—is, if you allow social media, and people started posting pictures and statements, then that could create more interreligious violence, physical violence between Buddhists, or Sinhalese, Christians and Muslims. So, that also is important to prevent that from taking place.
AMY GOODMAN : You were imprisoned in Sri Lanka for five years, a renowned prisoner of conscience. It’s where you began your legal studies, Kumar. And now you have represented political prisoners for years. You became the international advocacy director for Amnesty USA . Can you talk as a Tamil about what’s happened since the conflicts have ended in 2009?
T. KUMAR : Since the conflict ended in 2009, there was a justice issue that became one of the main issues for the affected Tamil community. So it went all the way to the Human Rights Council, and the council pretty much urged the Sri Lankan government to initiate some justice process, which still did not happen. The other aspects are the disappearance of thousands of Tamils who surrendered, as well as others who disappeared, then the victims—the plight of the victims, especially 90,000 Tamil women, who are mostly widows. So, the situation between Tamils and Sinhalese has kind of subsided more of a violent manner into a political issue and more of an international justice issue.
But the Muslim issue started about five years after the war ended. And it started between Muslims and Buddhists. Basically, Buddhist nationalists started going after Muslims, and it erupted in violence in two different places in Sri Lanka. Then, as Alan said earlier, last December, a group of Muslims, youth, went and attacked some Buddhist statues in the north—in the Sinhalese areas. And police was able to arrest most of them, but two brothers, they could not able to arrest. So, everyone was surprised that how come Sri Lankan security forces are unable to arrest these two individuals. Now it turned out that the Muslim youths are pretty much organized themselves, and you are seeing these results yesterday.
AMY GOODMAN : What do you think are the most important questions to ask, Kumar, that the media should be asking, about what’s happening in Sri Lanka right now? Of course, it’s very important not to jump to any conclusions. We don’t know exactly who’s responsible for this attack, which is considered one of the largest terrorist attacks in South Asia.
T. KUMAR : Yeah, the most important issue that media should be focusing on is, number one, the government got intelligence report 10 days ago about specific targets. According to the reports I read, the intelligence identified churches, you know, that there are going to be attacks on churches by suicide bombers, as well as on the Indian Embassy. So they had the intelligence, but they did not act. Either they did not take it seriously or, for whatever reason, that they did not act. So, the question is why they did not act, is number one question people should ask, media should ask.
Number two is what steps Sri Lankan government is taking to prevent any ethnic-religious angles. Communal violence between Muslims and Sinhalese, both Christians and Buddhists, is going to happen. There are reports of certain attacks against Muslim shops in certain parts of Sri Lanka in the Sinhalese areas. So, that also should be raised.
And, most importantly, the final one, ensure that civil liberties and arbitrary arrests, torture, disappearance are not taking place in the context of anti-terror operations that the government will be initiating now. The danger now we are seeing is, as Tamils faced before, during the ethnic conflict and war, Sinhalese community is going to be rounded up, investigated and also singled out for everything, suspects. They are going to be the suspects.
Until—during the war, Sinhalese—I’m sorry, Sri Lankan security forces, as well as the Muslims, had a very cordial relationship. Most of the Muslims were recruited as intelligence operatives, because they live, Muslims live, among Tamils, as well as they speak the language Tamil, so it’s easy to be intelligence officers and get information. Number two, Sri Lanka also recruited Muslims as home guards. Home guards is more of a paramilitary force against Tamil Tigers, the ethnic armed group that was fighting for 30 years. So, the relationship between the Muslims as well as the political—not political, the military establishment was very, very close. There are so many senior Muslim officers in the intelligence community, Sri Lankan intelligence community, as well as in the security forces, mostly in the senior level.
AMY GOODMAN : I want to thank you, T. Kumar, for joining us, former international advocacy director for Amnesty International USA , was a political prisoner in Sri Lanka for more than five years; and, Alan Keenan, for joining us, International Crisis Group Sri Lanka project director.

In Washington state, an investigation by The Guardian reveals a prominent Republican lawmaker held private discussions with far-right figures about spying on political opponents—and even targeting them with violence. Records from the private chat room show state Representative Matt Shea discussed disrupting a planned demonstration by anti-fascist protesters in Spokane with Jack Robertson, host of the far-right show “Radio Free Redoubt,” and with Anthony Bosworth, a veteran of the 2016 occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge by an anti-government militia. The chat logs show Shea agreed to carry out background checks on the protesters and did not object when Robertson proposed attacking a woman activist with the threat: “Fist full of hair, and face slam, to a Jersey barrier. Treat em like communist revolutionaries. Then shave her bald with a K-Bar USMC field knife.” After The Guardian published its exposé, Washington’s lieutenant governor called on Republicans to eject Rep. Shea from their caucus.

Forty-one-year-old comedian Volodymyr Zelensky leveraged his celebrity in a campaign that saw him promise to root out corruption and to end the war against pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine. The U.N. says the conflict has killed 13,000 people, a quarter of them civilians, since fighting broke out in 2014. In his hit show, “Servant of the People,” Zelensky portrays a president who resigns after facing down the International Monetary Fund.

AMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! I’m Amy Goodman, with Juan González.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: We turn now to another voice from Baltimore: D. Watkins, editor-at-large for Salon and best-selling author of the new book We Speak for Ourselves: A Word from Forgotten Black America . In his book, Watkins amplifies the experiences of poor black Americans he says are typically sidelined by the public and the media, including his own life story. He writes, quote, “I’m from the bottom, and what I mean by bottom is first-generation scholars, the project babies, the people without Wi-Fi, the workers, the people most likely to get hit by police bullets. We are the subjects of protests, the rarely heard-from even as our deaths are debated by media personalities who wouldn’t step foot on our blocks. … To quote the brilliant scholar and activist Dr. Su’ad Abdul Khabeer, 'You don't need to be a voice for the voiceless. Just pass the mic.’”
AMY GOODMAN : D. Watkins joins us now in our New York studio, professor at the University of Baltimore, founder of the BMORE Writers Project, also the author of The Cook Up: A Crack Rock Memoir and The Beast Side: Living and Dying While Black in America .
Welcome back to Democracy Now! It’s great to have you with us, D.
D. WATKINS : Thank you, guys, for having me.
AMY GOODMAN : And congratulations on the book. Talk about your own life story.
D. WATKINS : So, I grew up in a place where—and it’s crazy because—you know, again, I don’t step out there and try to be the voice for everybody. I can only speak for myself. But a lot of people from my community, we don’t have like big connections to huge groups of activists, right? This is like a brand-new culture for us. We don’t have, you know, the media personalities who get the opportunity to debate and talk about our stories a lot. So, you know, when these things happen, these viral killings and these viral murders, and we see these names danced and tossed around the screen, a lot of people who actually are the victims, they don’t—you know, they don’t get a chance to interact with these types of people before it happens, until we get like brand-new hashtags. So, this has been like the basis of not just my story, but the story of like a whole lot of people. So, I try my best to use my platform to elevate other people, so that we can build like a bigger narrative for what the contemporary black experience is.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And you were listening to this previous segment that we had on the student protests in Baltimore at Johns Hopkins. Of course, Johns Hopkins is this elite school in the middle of a majority-black city.
D. WATKINS : I went to school there, and I taught there. It’s not fun.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: Incidentally.
D. WATKINS : You know, you feel like, when you are a black person—well, my experience there has been like, you know, I kind of felt like an alien. So, when I heard the message about Ron Daniels kicking the BSU out of his house, it wasn’t like a strange thing for me. Baltimore’s a 65% black city. You can probably count the tenured professors of color on like one hand. You know, so what those students are going through and what they’re fighting, it’s a real thing. And, you know, giving them a police force could potentially lead to the murder of an innocent person. Like, it’s not even—you know, it sounds so sad and horrible for me to say it, but it’s the reality, something that could definitely happen.
AMY GOODMAN : You have a chapter in your book, “I’m Sick of Woke.” What do you mean?
D. WATKINS : Sick of woke culture. It’s like everybody’s running around, you know—and it’s crazy, because it started from a great place. It’s a great place when you’re calling out people and when you’re challenging systems and when you’re trying to make it better for everybody. It’s great. But when it gets to the point where like, you know, you’re using terminology like “microaggression” and “intersectionality” and all of these different things to demonize people who don’t even know what you’re talking about, it creates like these hierarchies within movements and these hierarchies within different classes of people. And it just—it gets ridiculous. You know, it’s becoming like, you know, fake thugs. You know what I’m saying? Like, you have to have this bravado and then this sea of words and language that everyone has to adhere to, when it’s just—it becomes even more divisive, and it fights against what it’s actually supposed to mean.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: I wanted to ask you about—you have a chapter in your book on “The Tradition of Failure,” on education. And you say, near the beginning, “The lack of progress made in public schools over the last fifty years is embarrassing and anyone who has the power to fix this but chooses not to truly wants poor black kids to fail.” And you go on, the history of education in relationship to African Americans and the system of failure.
D. WATKINS : Yeah, it’s like, what was like—name one subject you hated in school when you were growing up.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: I would say math.
D. WATKINS : OK. So, imagine doing it in like freezing cold. You know what I’m saying? And this isn’t the freezing cold in 1965. This is 2017, 2018 and 2019, where there are videos of students in Baltimore City Public Schools, you know, trying to take notes, but they’ve got to stop to blow on their hands, while they’ve got coats and scarves and earmuffs on, because the inside of that school is freezing. And, you know, the governor, Larry Hogan, didn’t make a statement or say anything about it until the video started going viral. So it’s never like—you know these issues exist. You’ve been—everybody knows. We’ve been talking about it for a long time. If my older brother and cousins and friends and all of the people who went to schools always talked about the resources that they didn’t have and how messed up it was, and then my dad and his generations of people that he came up with always talk about how bad the schools were, and then I have the same thing, and then my nephews and their little friends are saying the same thing, it’s like: At what point do we fix this? You know, it’s 2019.
AMY GOODMAN : Let me go to President Obama talking about race and policing at a 2016 town hall that was hosted by ABC News.
PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA : Their is real concern about making sure that interactions between police and community don’t result in death. And nobody wishes that more than police officers themselves, because when you talk to those police officers who have—whether justified or not, whatever the findings, have ended up killing somebody, it shatters them, too. I don’t know anybody in the African-American community or Latino community or others, that may have concerns about policing, that don’t also recognize we need police.
AMY GOODMAN : So, that was Barack Obama, when he was president, at a town hall. You were there, D. Watkins. Can you respond to what he said, and what President Obama meant to you, and then President Trump?
D. WATKINS : You know, so, that was like a special day for me, because Obama was like my big entry into—like, I literally write and study and read politics all day, every week, for me. So I’m really into it. And that came from following his election. So, the minute I get an email telling me I actually get to go sit in a room with this guy who’s meant so much to me was like amazing.
And then, when I’m sitting there and I’m hearing him talking about how, you know, we can’t really prosecute police officers because we need them to protect us, I’m like, “Man, they’re blowing our heads off.” And it was a difficult thing. So, you know, part of me was like, “Well, OK, so he’s going to say what he has to say, because this is around the time Trump was starting to catch steam.” This is when the MAGA rallies started popping up, and he started to get popular. But at the same time, we were in a room full of victims. One of them was Erica Garner, and she was promised a chance, you know, to be able to tell her story and talk about her experience and how the man who killed her father actually got a raise from overtime with his new desk job after that happened. So, it was—
AMY GOODMAN : That was Eric Garner.
D. WATKINS : Yeah, Eric Garner. So, it was—it started off as being like a great experience, but it ended up being a rough day, because that’s—you know, the conversation was called, like, “The President and the People,” and, you know, the people—Erica was definitely the people, because, like Tawanda, she was out there all of the time, like trying to get justice for her dad. And she had this opportunity, and which really wasn’t an opportunity, so they brought her down there for nothing.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: But she never got to speak at that town hall, did she? Or did she?
D. WATKINS : So, she got to speak, but she didn’t get to speak like—nobody—only people who knew were people who were there. And that’s because she exploded and stormed off the set. So, when she left the set, Secret Service was like, “Whoa, where are you going there?” And she was like, “Yo, don’t touch me. This is horrible.” And someone from Obama’s team had reached out and was like, “OK, well, you’re going to get to talk to him for like two seconds.” And she told me and some other people who—we were all going back to the train station, because they were going to New York and we were going back to Baltimore. And she was like, “Yo, he basically said that he can’t really speak on what’s happening because this Dallas police situation is helping Trump out.” And she’s like, “I don’t care about that. Like, why does everything have to be about politics? I care about this person who killed my father going to jail, and it looks like it’s not going to happen.”
AMY GOODMAN : And so, your assessment of Trump today and what he’s meant for the African-American community?
D. WATKINS : Absolutely nothing. Like, Trump, Donald Trump, is like a scum. Like, he is everything that—you know, everything we feel when we have an encounter with a racist police officer, everything we feel when we know we’re qualified for a job or a loan that we don’t get, everything that tears us apart as we try to navigate in this country. And again, you know, I’m not the guy who’s trying to say everyone feels like this, but I can say everything that I’ve felt and the struggles I’ve had in academia and in media and in general, you know, is all represented in him. It’s wrapped up in his bloated orange face. Like, all that anger and that aggression is right there. You know, he’s a clear example of it. And he can laugh, and he can joke, and he can, you know, fraud the world, and it’s disheartening to sit back and watch how many people are content with that.
AMY GOODMAN : Well, I want to thank you so much for being with us, D. Watkins, editor-at-large for Salon , his new book, We Speak for Ourselves: A Word from Forgotten Black America . D. Watkins is a professor at the University of Baltimore, founder of the BMORE Writers Project.

Students at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, have entered their 21st day of a sit-in occupation of their campus administration building to protest the university’s plans for an armed police force on campus, as well as Johns Hopkins’s contracts with Immigrations and Customs Enforcement. Students at Johns Hopkins are demanding the cancellation of contracts with ICE and a pledge to donate all money received from ICE to Baltimore’s immigration defense fund. They’re also demanding voluntary recognition for all workers wishing to unionize, and a student and faculty representative spot on the university’s board of trustees. This is viewer supported news. Please do your part today. member of Students Against Private Police and also a member of the Washington Hill Community Association. Transcript This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.
AMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , as we turn now to another student protest.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: Yes, we turn now to a protest over immigration by students at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, which has entered the [21st] day—the students have been sitting in for 20 days in protesting the university’s plans for an armed police force on campus, as well as Johns Hopkins’s contracts with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
PROTESTERS : JHU , shame on you! JHU , shame on you! JHU , shame on you! JHU , shame on you!
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: The Hopkins students are demanding the cancellation of contracts with ICE and a pledge to donate all money received from ICE to Baltimore’s immigration defense fund. They’re also demanding voluntary recognition for all workers wishing to unionize, and a student and faculty representative spot on the university’s board of trustees.
AMY GOODMAN : Democracy Now! invited Johns Hopkins to join us on our show, but the university declined our request.
We are going, though, to Baltimore, Maryland, where we’re joined by two guests. Mariam Banahi is a Johns Hopkins graduate student participating in the sit-in. She’s a Ph.D. candidate in anthropology, writing a dissertation on asylum seekers in Germany. And Chris Bilal is a member of Students Against Private Police and also a member of the Washington Hill Community Association, who’s participating in the Johns Hopkins sit-in.
We welcome you both to Democracy Now! Mariam, let’s begin with your protest around Johns Hopkins’ relationship with ICE . What is it?
MARIAM BANAHI : So, we’re very interested in how Hopkins presents itself as an ethical university and concerned with health and safety at home, but also its contracts with ICE . So, since 2008, Hopkins has profited and made about $7 million from its contracts with ICE . Currently there’s about $1.7 million in contracts that are ongoing. And these are which—the administration puts these in terms that it’s supportive of medical care and things like that, rather than actually supporting the detaining of asylum seekers. However, we see that as a kind of abstraction of the violence being enacted, because they support the actual structures that facilitate the workings of ICE . So, these contracts are set to expire this year, so we would like the university to end its contracts with ICE and donate the proceeds to something like the immigrant defense fund.
AMY GOODMAN : Which is what?
MARIAM BANAHI : It provides support for immigrants, asylum seekers in court cases, but also other kinds of immigrant justice efforts that can be decided upon later.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: Now, another issue has been the university’s attempt to begin to have an armed police force. Could you talk about that, as well?
MARIAM BANAHI : Yeah, I think Bilal can speak to that, as well.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: Well, Bilal, yes?
CHRIS BILAL : Yeah. Legislation just passed. Thank you for having me. Yeah, very dangerous legislation has just passed in Baltimore, granting this university, which is a repeat offender in terms of crimes against Baltimore city residents, has—they now have a police power. And so, again, 75% of the students at Johns Hopkins University said they did not want the police force. A bunch of community associations, primarily across Baltimore city, also said that they did not want this force.
There was a letter written by 100 faculty members of the administration who also said that, you know, they wanted to disarm, de-escalate and kind of defund this machine that was going to happen, and really calling for other solutions and investment and things like mediation, Safe Streets, ROCA , and community-driven alternatives to policing, because as a public health institution, Johns Hopkins University knows better and knows that more policing does not equate with less crime, but that more policing actually causes gentrification, it causes more anxiety and public health concerns around communities, causes the extraction of wealth from communities and also normalizes state-sanctioned violence and terror against black and brown bodies across America.
So, yeah, a lot of the students are kind of challenging and demonstrating against this investment in the mass incarceration system and the school-to-prison pipeline, and are demanding equity in terms of Hopkins reinvesting that money, after divesting, into community-driven alternatives that actually support the sustainability and wellness of people in Baltimore city.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Mariam, I wanted to ask you about the sit-in and how long it’s lasted now—20 days—and what the administration’s response has been. But I wanted to first play a clip that, earlier this month, some of your protesters confronted the university’s president, Ron Daniels, and peppered him with questions, and he refused to answer any of their questions. Let’s go to a clip from that exchange.
PROTESTER : So, I mean, we just want to meet—
RONALD DANIELS : So, as I said to you, I have no intention of scheduling anything with you until you clear out of the—clear out of the building. And then you can get what any other student group is always available to, which is schedule a meeting if you want to talk about things you’re concerned with.
PROTESTER : Yes, so, we’ve been trying to discuss—
RONALD DANIELS : Thanks, guys.
PROTESTER : We’ve been trying to discuss the private police for over a year.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: That was the president being confronted by one of the students, one of your fellow protesters. Mariam, what has been the response of the university to this long sit-in now?
MARIAM BANAHI : Yeah, so, we’re actually going into—today is Day 21 of the sit-in. So, it’s been going for three weeks now. We’ll continue it, and we’ll continue to escalate.
The university response has actually been quite disappointing. We actually have—it’s basically a nonresponse. As you saw, President Daniels, the provost, Provost Kumar, refuses to speak with us. And they also, since the beginning, have refused to offer us anything in writing from our conversations and the like. The only responses that we receive for them are coordinated drop-offs of basically threats, written statements, any time that there is a supposed violation that they deem as a violation. So, I think they’re creating a paper trail in order to pursue disciplinary actions against students as soon as it’s over for them. So it’s quite alarming that there are these methods being used to intimidate protesters, intimidate students, as well as we’ve heard reports that the Dean’s Office has been calling faculty members, especially faculty members who are in more precarious positions, and threatening them, to discourage them from supporting the sit-in, from—anyone who’s stepping in the space is also being pursued and surveilled in these ways, which is extremely alarming and which actually gives credibility to our concerns about what Hopkins would do with its own private, armed police force on campus and beyond and in the community.
Another thing to mention is that the faculty supports the sit-in. There’s a unanimous faculty assembly resolution. So, the community is also supportive of the sit-in. And the support is growing. Surely, it’s growing. And we had a great number of supporters coming in this weekend. We have a whole slew of events this week and into the weekend that are already being advertised. Pastor Heber Brown III of Pleasant Hope Baptist Church has expressed his support, and came and visited us on Sunday with members of his congregation, and will do that again next Sunday at 4 p.m. So, all are welcome.
CHRIS BILAL : Yeah, I was going to—I wanted to add to that, is that I was one of the people who was asking the questions to President Daniels. And as a community member, I think that the administration’s posture of silence towards communities is really bad. And I know folks who were involved in kind of like similar movements in the past will understand, when ACT UP said that silence equals death.
So, what was interesting is his answers to a lot of questions. The police force is billed as something that will generate safety for the people and residents of Baltimore and the students of Johns Hopkins University. But the more that I speak to students, especially women on campus, there is a big trend of women saying that they will feel safe when sexual assault is investigated on campus, that safety looks like investigating frat houses that have committed sexual crimes against folks on campus. I’ve also learned that one out of three undergrads also face sexual assault. And there is this weird case at Hopkins where 18 cases of sexual assault were like kind of deleted in kind of like this weird computer glitch. So when people talk about safety, that’s actually a lie, because Hopkins has been unable to protect its own students and make its own students feel safe. So, there’s no way that they’re going to be able to make people like me safe without profiling me.
And what’s also really scary—I asked President Daniels about mediation, because, basically, Hopkins has a long history of experimenting on black and brown people in Baltimore. It has a huge history of not paying taxes in Baltimore. Johns Hopkins, as a person, was actually a liquor distributor who, like, poisoned people. And also, his family, like, owned tobacco farms. And so they have a long history of poisoning the people of Baltimore, and also not, like, listening to people of Baltimore. So, this is a situation where students were demanding a mediation. You know, like the Faculty Senate kind of proposed a neutral, non-Hopkins-affiliated, mutually agreed-upon mediator, and which the folks could talk to administration officials, like Dean Smita and Kevin and Ron Daniels, who have sat in spaces and have heard these students talk about their concerns about safety, talk about their concerns about the accountability board, talk about their concerns around the boundaries, talked about how they want President Ron Daniels to resign.
And if Ron Daniels doesn’t want to resign, I believe that he should mediate with students or negotiate with students or—again, there was a part on the video where he said, “Are you going to come to dinner?” And I think we would like to come to dinner. I think that we would actually like to see Ron Daniels come to the sit-in and have dinner with students and community members and the coalition of interfaith folks who are interested in this, to come through, or we can have dinner at President Daniels’ house, because the last time that he invited the BSU , the Black Student Union, to his house around concerns around this, he actually kicked them out and said that they were ungrateful. So, we’re also demanding that he speak with the BSU , that he speak with people from the black and brown communities, who have not been consulted, and that they also continue those meetings that they were having, these public meetings around the police force. They canceled those meetings and refused to talk to people. So, this strategy of silence is really harmful.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: Bilal, I wanted to interrupt you, because we only have a few more minutes, but I wanted to ask you—one of the demands of the sit-in is justice for Tyrone West. And I want to turn to West’s sister—
CHRIS BILAL : Yes.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: —Tawanda Jones, speaking to WMAR -2 News.
TAWANDA JONES : To know that this can happen, these are not isolated incidents by far. It’s systemically happening. It’s happening all over the world. … Accountability looks like those officers involved in my brother’s brutal execution held accountable.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: For those who don’t know, who was Tyrone West?
CHRIS BILAL : Tyrone West was a Baltimorean who was the sister of Tawanda—
MARIAM BANAHI : Brother, brother.
CHRIS BILAL : Sorry, the brother of Tawanda. And he was actually murdered by police officers from Morgan State University, another university in Baltimore city, which has a police force that Hopkins is modeling their police force off of. And so, Sister West has been out here for—and next week will be her 300th week outside demanding justice for Tyrone West.
You know, the state actually didn’t, like, release a lot of information on the case. There are a lot of discrepancies in the coroner’s report. There are two different autopsies: one that kind of basically says that he was murdered in a case of state-sanctioned terror against him, and then, of course, the state’s narrative which says that, you know, he killed himself—which happens all too often.
So, Tawanda West has been out there every Wednesday for 299 weeks demanding justice and accountability for her brother. And, you know, this is really sad, because we were just watching the news from Yale, how a police officer from Yale also just shot Stephanie and Paul. So we’re asking for justice for Tyrone West and justice for Stephanie and Paul. And we also agree with their demands to disarm the YPD department and disarm Johns Hopkins University.
MARIAM BANAHI : And this also ties back to the case at Barnard recently with Alexander McNab being stopped by campus police coming in. He’s a Columbia student going onto Barnard’s campus, which is normal, business as usual. I’m a Barnard alumna, so I was extremely disturbed by seeing this. And he was accosted and pinned to the counter once he entered the library. And this has been repetitive. However, President Beilock of Barnard has had a much, I guess, better response to what has happened than President Daniels has at Hopkins. She’s been calling for change, and she recognizes the pernicious racialized atmosphere and the racial profiling that takes place on campuses. So, I think Ron Daniels needs to take a look at this.
AMY GOODMAN : Mariam Banahi, we want to thank you for being with us, Johns Hopkins graduate student—
MARIAM BANAHI : Thank you.

AMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! I’m Amy Goodman, with Juan González.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: Well, authorities at the University of Arizona in Tucson have dropped charges against three students who held a nonviolent protest against Border Patrol agents speaking on their campus. During the March 19th protest, the students called border agents “Murder Patrol” and, quote, “an extension of the KKK ,” unquote. One of the students filmed part of their encounter from outside the classroom where the agents were speaking.
DENISSE MORENO MELCHOR : This is supposed to be a safe space for students, but we have the Murder Patrol here. How about you talk about slashing water? How about you talk about taking the shoes off migrants, letting them walk through the desert barefoot? How about you talk about all the graves of unidentified folks?
AMY GOODMAN : All three students were charged with misdemeanors. On Friday, motions to dismiss the charges were granted, after the American Civil Liberties Union and other groups led a campaign on behalf of the students.
We go now to Tucson, Arizona, where we’re joined by Mariel Bustamante, one of the so-called Arizona Three. She’s a graduating senior who’s double-majoring in law and anthropology.
Welcome to Democracy Now! , Mariel. Explain what happened, why you were there.
MARIEL BUSTAMANTE : Hi, good morning. So, it started when the Criminal Justice Club invited the Border Patrol on campus to speak to the club about a number of things, like recruitment and such. Me and my fellow protesters, we saw them on campus, and we decided to speak out, because we were unhappy with their presence there. So that was why we were there, because we saw them armed, in uniform, and we thought that their presence there was unnecessary.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And nothing happened to you at the time, but then you were later visited by—at your mother’s house, by agents looking for you? Could you talk about that?
MARIEL BUSTAMANTE : Yeah. So, we did our demonstration. It lasted about 45 minutes. No names were taken, no IDs. And we kind of went about our lives for a while. And then, about 10 days later, police came to my mom’s house, where I don’t live, and to another one of the students’ home, with a citation for our disruption of an educational institution. And we had signed the charges later. They said that if I didn’t show up to my mom’s house, that I would be subjected to arrest.
AMY GOODMAN : And can you talk about the university’s response?
MARIEL BUSTAMANTE : Yeah. So, that was pretty interesting. The president released a series of emails, the first one supporting student free speech on campus. He didn’t really pick a side. He said, you know, students are able—should be able to speak out; all sides are welcomed. And then, a few days later, after meeting with the vice president of the Border Patrol Council, Art Del Cueto, on March 25th, things kind of changed: The university took a stance with Border Patrol, supporting the Criminal Justice Club. And that’s when we knew that charges would be filed against us.
And then there was another series of emails where, as more community support was coming about on our side, on behalf of us, the university, you know, wanted to do a series of campus conversations, supported free speech again. You know, there was a lot of confusion, a lot of juggling of thoughts from the university. And to this day, you know, they haven’t really standed with either side other than the Border Patrol.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And what was the response of the faculty at the university to the charges against you?
MARIEL BUSTAMANTE : So, the faculty, it was overwhelming support, mostly, specifically from the faculty of color. The faculty of color mobilized together, at first, for the first two people who were charged, and then, the additional third, more people came together. And there was a lot of support. They used their own individual community networks. They, depending where they were in their faculty, used their power to kind of talk to other staff and professors. And they mobilized to make sure that we were safe, that we had the resources we needed to try to finish school up, to help us get legal assistance. They really mobilized. They did letter-writing campaigns. They had sit-ins with the president. They had lots of conversations with people around the school and the community. So, they were very supportive.
AMY GOODMAN : So you’ll be graduating now without charges?
MARIEL BUSTAMANTE : Yes, mm-hmm, as of—I got the call on Sunday saying that charges were dropped. So I will be able to hopefully graduate by May 9th.
AMY GOODMAN : Well, Mariel Bustamante, we want to thank you for being with us, a University of Arizona student charged with a misdemeanor for protesting a Border Patrol appearance on campus. The charges have just been dropped. And she will be graduating from U of A.

JUAN GONZÁLEZ: We begin today’s show in New Mexico, where the FBI has arrested the head of an armed vigilante group that has repeatedly filmed itself detaining migrant border crossers at gunpoint. Sixty-nine-year-old Larry Mitchell Hopkins is the leader of the far-right, pro-Trump group calling itself United Constitutional Patriots, which the American Civil Liberties Union described as an “armed fascist militia organization.” His arrest came just days after the ACLU accused the vigilantes of illegally detaining 300 migrants, including young children, near Sunland Park, New Mexico, last week. Videos posted on social media showed the vigilantes holding migrants at gunpoint. In one of the videos uploaded by the United Constitutional Patriots, a man is heard considering another means of dealing with the migrants.
VIGILANTE : The only problem is, if we shoot on the hill, it’ll be an international crisis. We’re too close to the border. Would save some time, though, wouldn’t it?
AMY GOODMAN : The videos also show militia members praising President Trump’s border policies and echoing Trump’s rhetoric about a so-called invasion of migrants. New Mexico Attorney General Hector Balderas praised the FBI for arresting Larry Mitchell Hopkins, the head of the vigilante group. Balderas said, quote, “This is a dangerous felon who should not have weapons around children and families. Today’s arrest by the FBI indicates clearly that the rule of law should be in the hands of trained law enforcement officials, not vigilantes,” unquote.
According to documents unsealed in court Monday, Hopkins was first brought to the attention of federal authorities in 2017, when the FBI received reports his group was training to assassinate Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and George Soros. His arrest Saturday on firearms charges comes 12 years after he was arrested in Oregon for unlawfully impersonating a police officer, and more than two decades after he was convicted for illegal possession of a loaded firearm in the state of Michigan in 1996.
Joining us now is Peter Simonson, executive director of the ACLU of New Mexico. He’s in Albuquerque.
Welcome to Democracy Now! , Peter. Can you lay out who this man is, who the FBI have just detained, and what his group was doing along the border?
PETER SIMONSON : Sure. Well, you’ve pretty much explained what we know about Mr. Hopkins to this point. You know, the group has been operating for a while now. I think since we found out about them late last fall, they had been convening down in the Sunland Park area. And we really did not expect to see any sort of activity of the kind that they have manifested over the last several weeks, where they are actually detaining people, dozens of families, at gunpoint, and, you know, threatening them. These are families that consist of young mothers, younger children, even infants. And, you know, if you watch the videos, they’re just chilling. They’re just heartrending, to see innocent people exposed to this kind of a menace.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: Now, Peter Simonson, there’s quite a long history, isn’t there, of vigilante groups along the border? I think back to the 1990s, when there was a whole Light Up the Border movement by people who were concerned then that there was a major crisis of migrants coming across the border, and there have been isolated instances. But now we’re talking about—it seems to be a more permanently organized group. Don’t they actually have a small area that they’re camping out in near the border?
PETER SIMONSON : Yes, that’s true. The surge that we saw in the early 2000s, in the name of the Minutemen, really was kind of a temporary movement, it seemed, and they never demonstrated the kinds of behaviors that we’re seeing right now. This group seems to have a permanent encampment there, as of until Friday, this coming Friday. The El Paso Times , in fact, yesterday reported that the Union Pacific Railroad and the Sunland Park police have required them to move off the premises. And they are putting up, as I understand it from the story, “no trespassing” signs in that area. So it’s not entirely clear what the future fate of the vigilante group will actually be. But your point is exactly right. This is a more—appears to be a more determined group, and certainly a group that feels more empowered to take law into their own hands, and doesn’t seem to understand any of the consequences of their actions.
AMY GOODMAN : I’d like to turn to Jim Benvie, the spokesperson for the United Constitutional Patriots, who spoke to the El Paso Times .
JIM BENVIE : People ask me also: What is the rule of engagement here? The rule of engagement is, is that we are here just like anybody else, and the only time that we’re going to open fire is if we feel imminent threat or danger to our lives. We are a group of basically volunteer Americans who have come down here. We’re retired vets, retired law enforcement, special forces. We’ve come down here not as a militia, but as a group of Americans to help protect the border crisis that’s going on down here. This is a national security issue. Obviously, Border Patrol is part of this, as well. We’re trying to assist them. As far as in the overload, there’s areas right now that the Border Patrol can’t cover, because we have too many people coming through the border claiming false asylum.
AMY GOODMAN : In one of the videos narrated by Jim Benvie, posted online, vigilantes armed with assault rifles are seen approaching a group of several dozen people seated on the ground.
JIM BENVIE : Hey, guys. This is Jim with the United Constitutional Patriots and We Build the Wall. … As you can see, we did actually end up getting everybody wound up. It was a combination of us and some good horses over there and basically a team effort here.
AMY GOODMAN : So, Peter Simonson, if you can describe the scene? Some of these people, were they actually handcuffed? And talk about the distinction you make between a militia and vigilante.
PETER SIMONSON : Sure. I haven’t seen that particular segment of the video, so I’m not privy to the particular details. There’s 12 hours of video that they’ve posted on their Facebook site, and it’s been hard to comb through all of it. We’ve actually been very appreciative of the media, like Democracy Now! , that has done some of that work for us.
You know, we think that these folks should be labeled “vigilantes” because they are taking the law into their own hands. They meet every definition of “vigilante.” They believe that they understand what the terms of justice should be better than what the law actually outlines for us, and are willing to actually go to the lengths of using heavy weaponry to enforce the law as they see it should be done. I think they only adopt the name “militia” for the purpose of trying to associate themselves with some sort of constitutional narrative that they think justifies their actions, when in fact they are just a lawless band of individuals who are misguided in their intentions.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And do you have any sense of what the Border Patrol relationship is to these groups? Does the Border Patrol discourage citizens from taking action, or does it welcome the support of some kind by locals?
PETER SIMONSON : Great question. I think this is one of the outstanding questions that we have right now. There’s plenty of video evidence—I think you just showed some—that suggests that the Border Patrol is actively collaborating with these folks, despite the fact that they’ve made a public statement saying that they neither condone nor endorse their activity. We have plenty of video documentation showing Border Patrol showing up to take the folks that they have illegally detained into custody. There are pictures of the Constitutional Patriot folks posing in photos with Border Patrol on horseback. There seems to have been a fairly easy and cooperative relationship between the vigilante group and the Border Patrol.
And, you know, the question I am left with is: Why did no one tell these folks to cease and desist? And if the Border Patrol is in fact a law enforcement agency, even if they themselves were not going to initiate an investigation into these folks, why couldn’t they have called upon FBI to look into the matter? We met with the U.S. attorney here in New Mexico late last night—late yesterday afternoon and asked him what has been done to tell these folks to stop what they’re doing. And, you know, he could only share so much, but it’s my understanding, from—I have been given no evidence to say that any federal authority has told these folks they need to stop what they’re doing.
And so, you know, our key concern is that families’ safety, families’ welfare is at stake here. You look at those videos, and what you see is literally dozens of families huddled in the sand in a remote part of the desert in the dead of night, surrounded by men in military camouflage, masked many times, with heavy weaponry, semiautomatic weapons in some instances. You can only imagine a situation where somebody reaches for something in their pocket, pulls out a cellphone, and it looks like a firearm. And you have a gunfight that ensues. Those kinds of tragedies are the ones we have been really trying to move to avoid.
AMY GOODMAN : Speaking to BuzzFeed News, one of the vigilantes, Mark Cheney, acknowledged some members of the—wore badges similar to those worn by Border Patrol agents. He said, “If [immigrants] can’t tell the difference, that’s their problem.” Now, isn’t that Cheney’s problem? I mean, you have the guy that the FBI just arrested, 12 years ago being arrested in Oregon for unlawfully impersonating a police officer. Isn’t it illegal to do that? And why is it just the head of this vigilante group that has been taken in? And if Trump is supporting them, what will happen next?
PETER SIMONSON : Amy, you’re asking all the questions that are foremost in our mind right now. From all appearances, these folks were impersonating federal officers, even approaching immigrant families and announcing themselves as U.S. Border Patrol, in other cases announcing themselves as polícia to the Spanish-speaking immigrants. I don’t understand how, under any definition that you see in federal law, they can’t be charged—and by “they,” I mean not just Mr. Hopkins, but the rest of the folks there that are gathered on the border—with falsely impersonating a federal officer.
And that’s just the beginning of possible federal charges against these folks. We’re also looking at possible kidnapping, conspiracy to kidnap. The fact that they have—that they’re armed and holding people at gunpoint only adds to the seriousness of those federal crimes. And so, really, we are hoping to see that our federal authorities are going to bring further charges against these people, because the video evidence—and there’s a wealth of it—shows that they should be—they appear to be guilty of multiple crimes. And Mr. Hopkins is just the tip of the iceberg.
AMY GOODMAN : And, of course, we only know about this because they made a video. They themselves posted it online. How much is this happening along the border? And let’s not forget that your state, New Mexico, is where the two children in Border Patrol custody died, the migrant children.
PETER SIMONSON : Yeah, exactly. And beyond that, obviously these folks lack some degree of competence, that they were so bold as to actually broadcast, advertise, videotape their illegal activity. But you have to think at some point some caution must have clicked in, and where their more extreme actions were happening, maybe they didn’t videotape. So, I don’t think we know the full story of how these people were actually treating the families that they were illegally taking into custody. And who’s to say whether somebody might be out in the desert still, having been the victim of a gunshot, or someone that was roughed up and escaped through another part of the border? I mean, we have no idea what these people are doing to the families that are coming across. And unless this activity is stopped, again, it could end very tragically.
AMY GOODMAN : But we do know that people like No More Deaths, who put bottles of water in the desert so that people won’t die of thirst, are being arrested. Peter Simonson, I want to thank you for being with us, executive director of the ACLU of New Mexico.
This is Democracy Now! When we come back, we’re going to cover two campus protests—a sit-in at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore and a protest at the University of Arizona—around immigration presence on campus. Stay with us.

Sri Lanka’s defense minister says Sunday’s coordinated bombings at churches and hotels across the island nation were a response to last month’s attacks on mosques by a white nationalist gunman who killed 50 Muslim worshipers in the New Zealand city of Christchurch. Sri Lankan officials say a little-known Muslim organization called National Thowheed Jama’ath carried out the Easter Sunday bombings with another Sri Lankan group known as the JMI . Separately, the self-proclaimed Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the bombings, though it offered no evidence. The death toll from the bombings rose today to 321, with more than 500 injured, as Sri Lanka marks a national day of mourning. Trump Admin to Ratchet Up Unilateral U.S. Sanctions on Iranian Oil Apr 23, 2019
The Trump administration said Monday it will fully enforce unilaterally imposed U.S. sanctions against Iran, ending a waiver program that allowed some nations to continue buying Iranian oil without suffering penalties from the U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced the tightening of sanctions Monday, saying the move will benefit Saudi Arabia and other U.S. allies in the Gulf.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo : “The United States has been in constant discussion with allies and partners to help them transition away from Iranian crude to other alternatives. And we have been working with major oil-producing countries to ensure the market has sufficient volume to minimize the impact on pricing. Both the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have assured us they will ensure an appropriate supply for the markets.”
Chinese authorities immediately pushed back against the move to ratchet up sanctions, saying it jeopardizes talks with the U.S. aimed at ending President Trump’s trade war. China is Iran’s single biggest customer of oil, consuming about half of the 1 million barrels Iran exports daily. Iran’s economy has suffered heavily since the Trump administration backed out of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, which gave Tehran sanctions relief in exchange for a promise not to build nuclear weapons.

The Supreme Court hears oral arguments today in a case challenging the Trump administration’s plans to include a question on citizenship on the 2020 census. Justices will rule on whether Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross had the authority to add the question to the census. The American Civil Liberties Union and 17 states have sued, saying Ross’s move was aimed at deterring immigrants from participating in the census, leading to a vast undercount in states with large immigrant communities. This is journalist Ari Berman speaking with Democracy Now! last Election Day.
Ari Berman : “The census is basically the DNA of our democracy. It determines so many things that we do, from how $675 billion in federal funding is distributed to how political districts are drawn to how many electoral votes states get. And if the census is rigged, then all of American democracy will be rigged, as well.” Topics: "

The Supreme Court also said Monday it will take up three cases that will determine whether LGBTQ people will be covered by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, which bars employers from discriminating against employees on the basis of sex, race, color, national origin and religion. The Trump administration will argue that the act was not intended to provide protection to gay or transgender workers. Justices will hear arguments in the case in the fall, with a decision likely by June of 2020. In the meantime, LGBTQ activists are calling on Congress to pass the Equality Act, which would amend civil rights laws to explicitly protect LGBTQ people against discrimination. Topics:"

Meanwhile, House Democratic leaders warned rank-and-file lawmakers Monday against pressing for President Trump’s impeachment. In a conference call with more than 170 lawmakers Monday evening, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other senior Democrats warned of the political consequences pressing for impeachment would have on the 2020 election. Pelosi said Democrats should instead focus on committee investigations into Trump. Over the weekend, Massachusetts Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren became the first 2020 presidential candidate to call for Trump’s impeachment. During town hall events hosted by CNN Monday, candidates Bernie Sanders, Amy Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg said they don’t support an immediate drive to impeach Trump, while California Senator Kamala Harris said she supports the idea.
Sen. Kamala Harris : “I think we have very good reason to believe that there is an investigation that has been conducted, which has produced evidence that tells us that this president and his administration engaged in obstruction of justice. I believe Congress should take the steps towards impeachment.” Topics:"

Joseph Stiglitz: Elizabeth Warren & Bernie Sanders Want to Make the Economy Work for All Americans,www.democracynow.org,mail@democracynow.org (Democracy Now!),04-24-2019,2019,4,https://www.democracynow.org/2019/4/24/joseph_stiglitz_elizabeth_warren_bernie_sanders,"Joseph Stiglitz Nobel Prize-winning economist, Columbia University professor and chief economist for the Roosevelt Institute. He served as chair of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Bill Clinton. His new book is People, Power, and Profits: Progressive Capitalism for an Age of Discontent . Transcript This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.
AMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! I’m Amy Goodman, with Juan González. The Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy has found the number of large U.S. companies who paid nothing in federal taxes has doubled in recent years. The companies include Amazon, Netflix, General Motors, IBM , Chevron, Eli Lilly, Delta, Occidental Petroleum, Honeywell, Prudential, Halliburton, Whirlpool and Goodyear. Senator Elizabeth Warren recently introduced a proposal called the Real Corporate Profits Tax to force companies to pay a 7% tax on all profits over $100 million. Warren outlined the plan on MSNBC .
SEN . ELIZABETH WARREN : It’s just if you have more than $100 million in reported after-tax profits, the 100 millionth and first dollar should be taxed at 7%, and that just goes straight across the board. The simplicity of it is part of what makes it work so well and makes sure no giant corporation in this country gets away with paying zero, while small companies and families are having to pick up the ticket to run the country.
AMY GOODMAN : So, that’s presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren. And we hope she will join us on Democracy Now! We hope all those who are her friends, in her close circle, will hear that message, and she herself. But we are joined now by Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz. His latest book, People, Power, and Profits . What about this?
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: That’s like an alternative minimum tax for corporations.
JOSEPH STIGLITZ : That’s right. And I actually think there should be a global minimum tax, because what is going on is that they’re avoiding not only taxes in the United States, but they’re looking around the world for places, like Panama and the tax paradises, to avoid taxes. Apple was particularly bad, where they shifted all their money into Ireland, from all their profits in Europe, and then did a special deal with Ireland so they basically paid almost no taxes, .02 or .2%—I mean, really very low, a real example of tax avoidance, almost at the level of evasion.
The point I want to make, the point that Elizabeth is making, is that our big corporations are showing the same ingenuity of coming out with good products—they’re showing that same ingenuity in avoiding taxes, and making sure that we have laws that allow them to do that. And she’s saying that’s wrong.
She’s also emphasized that it distorts our economy. It distorts our economy in two ways. Where business gets located is distorted, because you search for a tax haven. But it also gives these big companies an advantage over small corporations, over, you know, individual companies. And so, that’s not a level playing field. The big companies expand, not because they’re necessarily more efficient, but because they’re better at avoiding their tax obligations.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: I’m wondering, the—Elizabeth Warren, particularly, has been rolling out a series now of proposals, some of them apparently very well thought out, because we have 20 Democratic candidates, but we have sort of a lack of their specifics of what they stand for. I’m wondering what your sense—
AMY GOODMAN : Twenty tomorrow, when Biden announces.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: I’m wondering what you think about her student debt proposal and also her call to break up the big tech companies.
JOSEPH STIGLITZ : So, first of all, let me say, you know, that you should look at these proposals in two ways. She’s setting out a set of principles: We ought to have more progressive taxation and not let the corporations escape taxation; we ought to do something about the growth of monopoly power in our society; we ought to make sure that education is accessible to everybody, regardless of their income and of their parents. You know, these are basic principles which all Americans should subscribe to.
Then, the second thing is, here is a particular way we can implement that. And, you know, let’s all be—we all know that when we go to Congress, there will be a lot of discussion about how to do it, and hopefully during the primaries and the election, there will be a lot more discussion. But she’s putting forward the idea that these are doable ideas. These are not pie-in-the-sky. We can do it. We can get more progressive taxation, for instance, by a small wealth tax on those with more than $50 million. I mean, it’s not going to affect even the bottom 1%—I mean, the bottom 99% are not going to be affected. We’re talking about a fraction of the top 1%. So that’s one example.
On the student—
AMY GOODMAN : And she’s—oh, go ahead on the student loan.
JOSEPH STIGLITZ : On the student loan thing, we have a student debt now of $1.5 trillion. It’s so large, it’s beginning to affect our macroeconomy. It’s affecting individuals’ lives. They can’t get—you know, buy a home, start a family, because of the debt. Now—
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: It’s a new form of indentured servitude.
JOSEPH STIGLITZ : It’s a new form of indentured servitude. And so, we have to think about it in two parts. One, going forward, how do we make sure that a university education is affordable to everybody? And the second part is: What do we do with the backlog of $1.5 trillion?
Now, she has a particular proposal. It’s somewhat different from the one that I’ve been advocating. What I think is that you should have what I call contingent repayment. If your income is below a certain level, say, below $50,000, you don’t pay back anything. If it’s over $200,000, you might pay back 4%. And then you keep paying it back until you pay it all back, except after 25 years, you say, look at, you’ve done what you can to repay the debt, and we’ll write off the rest. One way or another, we have to deal with that legacy debt problem.
AMY GOODMAN : Let’s go to Bernie Sanders on Fox News, which was controversial in itself, but he wanted to address a Trump audience. He was speaking about democratic socialism.
SEN . BERNIE SANDERS : Democratic socialism, to me, is creating a government and an economy and a society which works for all rather than just the top 1%. It means ending the absurd inequalities that exist today. And I want to lay this out, because you’re not going to hear this much on Fox, and you’re not going to hear this much in the media, in general. And the American people have got to conclude whether we think it is appropriate and what America is about to have three families owning more wealth than the bottom half of the American society, 160 million people; whether it’s appropriate for the top 1% to own more wealth than the bottom 92%; whether it is right that 49% of all new income goes to the top 1%, when many people, Bret and Martha, who are watching this program, are working two or three jobs just to pay the bills.
AMY GOODMAN : So, that’s Bernie Sanders speaking on Fox. And again, we invite Bernie Sanders to be here on Democracy Now! at the table during this election cycle. Joe Stiglitz?
JOSEPH STIGLITZ : So, I think he’s given a good definition of what is called democratic socialism. Now, what Trump is trying to do is confuse people’s minds. Traditionally, socialism, you know, a hundred years ago, was about the ownership of the basic means of production. You didn’t hear a word about that from Bernie Sanders. He’s not talking about that old-style socialism. He’s not saying we want to bring Maduro, Venezuela, to America. That’s not what he’s talking about. What he’s really talking about is what in Europe is called social democracy, sometimes called the welfare state, sometimes—you know, it’s basically based on: We need systems of social protection; we need systems to make sure that we invest in our young people, invest in our infrastructure, invest in R&D; we invest in the future, protect the climate and protect the environment. In other words, we make our economy work for all Americans.
And the word I use is progressive capitalism. But, you know, is there any difference between my definition of progressive capitalism and what Bernie has called democratic socialism? No. It’s all trying to get at an economy that serves our citizens. And I’ve tried to emphasize there’s going to be a market part of this. And what Bernie is emphasizing, yeah, and there’s also going to be a part where the government is going to have to play a role. And I emphasize both of those in my book.

AMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! I’m Amy Goodman, with Juan González.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: Well, Disney heiress Abigail Disney is speaking out against wage inequality, calling Disney CEO Bob Iger’s salary, quote, “insane.” In an opinion piece for The Washington Post published Tuesday titled “It’s time to call out Disney—and anyone else rich off their workers’ backs,” she wrote, quote, “I had to speak out about the naked indecency of chief executive Robert Iger’s pay. According to Equilar, Iger took home more than $65 million in 2018. That’s 1,424 times the median pay of a Disney worker. To put that gap in context, in 1978, the average CEO made about 30 times a typical worker’s salary. Since 1978, CEO pay has grown by 937 percent, while the pay of an average worker grew just 11.2 percent. This growth in inequality has affected every corner of American life.”
AMY GOODMAN : Those are the words of Abigail Disney. She went on to write, “At the pay levels we are talking about, an executive giving up half his bonus has zero effect on his quality of life. For the people at the bottom, it could mean a ticket out of poverty or debt. It could offer access to decent health care or an education for a child,” she wrote.
We spend the rest of the hour looking at inequality and the state of the economy with the Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz, who served as chair of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Clinton. Joe Stiglitz is a professor at Columbia University, professor and chief economist for the Roosevelt Institute. His latest book is out this week: People, Power, and Profits: Progressive Capitalism for an Age of Discontent .
Joe Stiglitz, welcome back to Democracy Now! It’s great to have you with us. Why don’t you start off by talking about Abby Disney, what she had to say? She is the heiress of Disney, saying that Iger’s salary, the CEO , is “insane.”
JOSEPH STIGLITZ : She’s absolutely right. You mentioned that in the late '70s it was 30 to one, on average; today it's over 300 to one. And it’s not as if our CEOs have gotten 10 times as productive in those intervening years. It’s not as if—you know, American CEOs get paid so much more than their workers relative to those in Europe and even more relative to those in Japan. And it’s not because our CEOs are that much more productive. It’s because we have a real problem in our corporate governance laws, in our norms, that allow them to take away that much money.
And that money—you know, she points that it could have gone to—made a very big difference to workers. That money could also have gone into investment. You know, one of the striking things about the United States today is that while the rates of return are very, very high relative to what they’ve been in the past, the levels of investment have been low. So, you would have thought those two would have gone together, but with CEO pay and share buybacks being so large—trillion dollars of share buybacks last year—the money isn’t going either to workers or to investment.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And then, of course, you have to add the taxation policy, which is gradually protecting wealth rather than trying to create a level playing field, whether it’s with the elimination of the inheritance tax or the ending, effectively, of progressive taxation. That means that all that money that they get, they get to keep, as well, right?
JOSEPH STIGLITZ : Yeah. You know, this is a time where we—given the growth of inequality, you would have thought the natural response is to ramp up a progressivity of our tax system. And we’ve done just the opposite. The 2017 tax bill is a real illustration of that. It increased the tax rate on a majority of people in the second, third and fourth quintile. In other words, the vast middle class, when the bill is fully implemented, will see higher tax rates, in order to give a tax cut for billionaires.
Another way I put it as an economist, going back to your question about Abigail Disney, they talk about incentives. What kind of a CEO do you need to pay $60 million to get him off the golf course? You know, you don’t pay a surgeon who’s doing heart surgery, and say, “I’ll pay you a lot of money, provided I survive. But if I don’t, by the way, you don’t get anything.” Surgeons are professionals. They do all that they can to make sure that the surgery enables you to live. Our CEOs ought to be that kind of professional. And they used to be that kind of professional. They say, “My job, I’m trusted by my corporation to do the best I can for the corporation, and I’ll give it all. And you’re paying $5 million or $10 million to do that. That’s more than adequate.” And in other countries, people have that kind of sense of responsibility. But not, evidently, CEOs like that of Disney.
AMY GOODMAN : Joe, your book is titled People, Power, and Profits: Progressive Capitalism for an Age of Discontent . Should it be progressive capitalism or worker power? I mean, this is increasingly becoming the issue, when you have the top candidates and most popular political figures, like AOC , Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, like Bernie Sanders, one of the top presidential contenders, proudly calling themselves Democratic Socialists.
JOSEPH STIGLITZ : Yeah. So, in those few words in the title, I try to pack an awful lot. So, one of the things I wanted to say is that any modern economy, the market is going to have to play an important role. So, that’s why I wanted to use the word “capitalism.” But I wanted to signal that the form of capitalism that we’ve seen over the last 40 years has not been working for most people. And that’s why I talk about people. We have to have progressive capitalism. We have to tame capitalism and redirect capitalism so it serves our society. You know, people are not supposed to serve the economy; the economy is supposed to serve our people.
The other word I talk about is “power.” Here, what I’m trying to capture is, there’s a real sense of powerlessness by a lot of Americans—powerlessness in the economy and powerlessness in our politics. It’s because of the increased concentration of market power in our economy, the growth of those monopolies, tech monopolies, monopolies in so many sectors, which is one of the factors that have contributed to all this inequality. But there’s also—
AMY GOODMAN : Hasn’t capitalism always done that?
JOSEPH STIGLITZ : Not to the extent that it has. You know, you can trace out the degree of monopoly power. And, yes, it was terrible at the end of the 19th century, and that’s why we passed anti-trust laws. And they worked for a while. We broke up Standard Oil. We broke up a lot of the other big monopolies. And then, around the middle of the 20th century, there was a set of ideas that were propagated by Milton Friedman at University of Chicago, that said, “The market is naturally competitive. Don’t worry about market power.” And that was just basically giving a blank check to the formation of more monopolies.
The idea that corporations will to try to exert that kind of exploitation for market power is an old one. Adam Smith talked about it. You know, he talked about this idea that the business leaders seldom get together, even for merriment, without getting a conspiracy against the general well-being. So, he was aware of it. But that’s why we passed laws to circumscribe it. And then we had this doctrine that says, “Don’t worry about it.” And now we see the consequences of not worrying about it. And it’s reached new, high peaks.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: Well, I wanted to ask you about one section in your book where you’ve—and several of your articles—you’ve talked about China and what’s the economic model of China. In your book, you say, “For many of the billions in the developing world and emerging markets, China, using its distinctive [quote] 'socialist' market economy with Chinese characteristics, has provided a dynamic alternative vision to that of America, whose standing suffered a major blow with the 2008 crisis.” Now, China, to many folks, is basically a form of state capitalism, not really socialism, but state capitalism, yet it has had an enormous economic growth—7, 10% a year—and it’s raised hundreds of millions of people out of poverty.
JOSEPH STIGLITZ : About 740 million people out of poverty.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: So, what does that say about the form of capitalism that we have in the United States, or even in Western Europe, that China is economically providing much more to its people these days than these systems are, in terms of where it came from?
JOSEPH STIGLITZ : Well, first, you have to remember they were catching up. And it proved to be an effective instrument for catching up. But there’s a price in terms of democracy. And I would have hoped that we would be a model, showing that you can have a kind of capitalism that actually works for people, the kind of progressive capitalism that I’ve been talking about, that can deliver growth, but not just for the 1% or one-tenth of 1%, but for the majority of our citizens.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: But hasn’t the exacerbation of inequality—I go back to the collapse of the Soviet Union and the Soviet bloc. There were competing systems back then, and Western capitalism had to at least provide some benefits to its workers to prevent them from going toward socialism. With the collapse of the Soviet Union and the Eastern European countries, not only were new markets opened up for capitalism, but there was no longer a need to give any sops to the working class, as a result of the fact that there was no longer a competing system.
JOSEPH STIGLITZ : I think you’re absolutely right. And I think it’s one of the forces that have undermined the way our economic system has worked. We haven’t been challenged, to put it in a way. But we are being challenged now, because so many people have done so poorly.
AMY GOODMAN : And when you say “we,” you mean?
JOSEPH STIGLITZ : United States, we as a country, but also Western Europe. To put it, you know, another way, in the 1950s, we aspired to be the first middle-class society. And we talked about education for all. We had infrastructure investment. We had a tax rate at the top of 90%, and we had the fastest rate of growth that we’ve ever had.
AMY GOODMAN : We have to break. When we come back, we want to ask you about how healthcare for all, how canceling of student debt, pre-K, how all of these issues can be financed under progressive capitalism—all the issues that are being put forward by a few of the Democratic candidates right now.

Presidential candidate and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders said at a town hall Monday that he believed in restoring voting rights for prisoners, sparking a national discussion about re-enfranchisement for the more than 2 million Americans behind bars. Presidential hopeful Pete Buttigieg has spoken out against prisoner voting rights, while Senator Elizabeth Warren said “I’m not there yet” on the issue. Senator Kamala Harris said “there has to be serious consequence for the most extreme types of crimes,” referencing her background as a prosecutor. We speak with Ari Berman, senior writer at Mother Jones, about the public debate on voting rights for imprisoned Americans. Berman notes that prisoners are currently counted in the U.S. census in the counties where they are imprisoned, despite not being allowed to vote in most states. This is viewer supported news.

AMY GOODMAN : I want to turn to this issue of voting rights for prisoners, which has sort of exploded on the scene this week, though it’s been an issue for a long time, because, on Monday, presidential candidate Senator Bernie Sanders was asked about it during a CNN town hall, if prisoners, like the Boston Marathon bomber, should be allowed to vote while locked up.
SEN . BERNIE SANDERS : As it happens in my own state of Vermont, from the very first days of our state’s history, what our Constitution says is that everybody can vote. That is true. So people in jail can vote. Now, here is my view. If somebody commits a serious crime—sexual assault, murder—they’re going to be punished. They may be in jail for 10 years, 20 years, 50 years, their whole lives. That’s what happens when you commit a serious crime. But I think the right to vote is inherent to our democracy. Yes, even for terrible people, because once you start chipping away and you say, “Well, that guy committed a terrible crime, not going to let him vote,” or “That person did that, not going to let that person vote,” you’re running down a slippery slope.
AMY GOODMAN : Of course, Senator Sanders comes from Vermont, where prisoners can vote, as can Maine. During another presidential forum that night on CNN , presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, came out against voting rights for prisoners.
MAYOR PETE BUTTIGIEG : Part of the punishment, when you’re—when you’re convicted of a crime and you’re incarcerated, is you lose certain rights. You lose your freedom. And I think, during that period, it does not make sense to have an exception for the right to vote.
AMY GOODMAN : And CNN’s Don Lemon put the question to Senator Kamala Harris of California during her presidential town hall that night.
DON LEMON : People who are convicted, in prison, like the Boston Marathon bomber, on death row, people who are convicted of sexual assault, they should be able to vote?
SEN . KAMALA HARRIS : I think we should have that conversation.
AMY GOODMAN : So, she said, “I think we should have that conversation,” Monday night. But on Tuesday, Senator Harris said, quote, “I’m a prosecutor. I believe … there has to be serious consequence for the most extreme types of crimes,” unquote. Senator Elizabeth Warren has also weighed in about allowing prisoners to vote. Speaking at an event in South Carolina, she said, quote, “I’m not there yet.” Ari Berman?
ARI BERMAN : Well, this really is not as radical as it seems. As you mentioned, two states—Vermont and Maine—already allow prisoners to vote. Virtually every other industrialized democracy in the world allows prisoners to vote.
And it’s not about whether terrible people should lose all of their rights or be punished. It’s about whether you lose fundamental citizenship just because you did one thing wrong. And it’s interesting. Prisoners are already counted for redistricting purposes, so they are already counted where they are incarcerated, but yet they’re not allowed to vote. So it doesn’t make a whole lot of sense. And if you believe the purpose of prison is not just punishment, but rehabilitation, then allowing people to still have one of their most fundamental civic responsibilities is a key aspect of rehabilitation.
So I’m glad that we’re having this conversation. I hope it’s not demonized in the way that many media are talking about it, saying, “Should the Boston bomber be allowed to vote?” That’s incredibly disingenuous. That’s not the conversation we should be having. It’s about should millions and millions of people be stripped of their fundamental rights. And I think that’s the question we need to be having in this country.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: Of course, the decision has to be made state by state, right? It’s basically the states who decide who gets to vote in their area.
ARI BERMAN : The states decide this. And like with a lot of things, the president is not a king. OK? We have to remember that.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: Right.
ARI BERMAN : So, people think that the presidential candidates can just wave a magic wand and do everything. But right now 6 million people can’t vote in this country, either because they’re behind bars or even when they get out they still can’t vote. And the question is: Should voting be a fundamental right for everyone, no matter what you do, or should it be something that’s restricted to one segment of the population or another? And what Bernie Sanders is saying is that if you go down that road, deciding some people can vote and not others, that’s just going to lead to wider and broader disenfranchisement.
AMY GOODMAN : Well, we want to thank you both for joining us. Ari Berman is senior writer at Mother Jones , author of the book Give Us the Ballot: The Modern Struggle for Voting Rights in America . And Thomas Saenz is president and general counsel of MALDEF , the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund, speaking to us from Los Angeles.

The U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments Tuesday in a case challenging the Trump administration’s plans to include a citizenship question on the 2020 census. Voting rights activists fear that adding the question will deter immigrants from participating in the census and lead to a vast undercount in states with large immigrant communities. Census officials have estimated 6.5 million people will not respond to the census if the citizenship question is added. This undercount could affect everything from the redrawing of congressional maps to the allocation of federal funding.

JUAN GONZÁLEZ: The U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments Tuesday in a case challenging the Trump administration’s plans to include a question on citizenship to the 2020 census. Voting rights activists fear that adding the question will deter immigrants from participating in the census and lead to a vast undercount in states with large immigrant communities. Census officials have estimated 6.5 million people will not respond to the census if the citizenship question is added. This undercount could affect everything from the redrawing of congressional maps to the allocation of federal funding.
The case centers on whether Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross had the authority to add the question to the census. The American Civil Liberties Union and 17 states have sued, saying Ross’s move was aimed at deterring immigrants from participating in the census. During the oral arguments, the court’s conservative majority appeared to side with the Trump administration, while the liberal minority questioned the administration’s motives and methods. Liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor said, quote, “There’s no doubt that people will respond less. If you’re talking about prediction, this is about 100 percent that people will answer less.”
AMY GOODMAN : Chief Justice John Roberts appeared to support the addition of the citizenship question, saying it was, quote, “quite common” to add a demographics questions to the census. He asked the plaintiffs in the suit, “Do you think it wouldn’t help voting rights enforcement?” Conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh said the United Nations recommends countries ask a citizenship question on the census, listing a number of countries that ask about citizenship, including Spain, Germany, Canada, Australia, Ireland and Mexico. After the Supreme Court heard oral arguments, New York state Attorney General Letitia James, who helped bring the lawsuit, spoke outside the court.
ATTORNEY GENERAL LETITIA JAMES : Adding that particular citizenship question could lead to the undercounting in communities across America, particularly in immigrant communities and Hispanic communities. It would mean that communities entitled to resources wouldn’t get those resources. It would deny certain communities of equal representation. And so, in the interest of fairness, in the interest of upholding this quintessential American promise, we are obligated to ensure the most accurate count in the 2020 census. And as such, we must use every tool at our disposal, in our arsenal, to fight to protect its integrity. And that’s what we did today.
AMY GOODMAN : [We go now] to Los Angeles, where we’re joined by Thomas Saenz, president and general counsel of MALDEF , the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund. MALDEF is representing plaintiffs in one of the lawsuits challenging the census citizenship question. And here in New York, we’re joined by Ari Berman, senior writer at Mother Jones , reporting fellow at The Nation Institute, author of Give Us the Ballot: The Modern Struggle for Voting Rights in America .
So, Ari, you attended the Supreme Court oral arguments yesterday. Set the scene for us. And were you surprised by the tenor of the questions?
ARI BERMAN : I did. And this really is one of the most important cases for democracy in decades, Amy, because the census determines so many things in our society: how $880 billion in federal funding is allocated, how voting districts are drawn, how many House seats, how many Electoral College votes states have. There really is nothing we do that’s more important in a democracy than the census. And this one question about U.S. citizenship has the possibility to derail the entire census. One of the most important and longest constitutional responsibilities that our government has could now be derailed and turned into a political weapon by the Trump administration to target immigrants and places where lots of immigrants live.
And so, I was hoping I would hear these big-picture debates in the Supreme Court about the importance of the census and how this question threatens the census. Instead, the conservative justices on the court seemed very sympathetic to this question. They really didn’t question the motives of Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, who added this question, even though three different federal courts have struck it down. Six years ago, I was in the Supreme Court when they railed against the Voting Rights Act, called it an act of regional discrimination against the South. And then, suddenly, six years later, the same conservative justices that gutted the Voting Rights Act suddenly believe that this citizenship question is now necessary to enforce the Voting Rights Act, which every voting rights lawyer will tell you it’s not. And so, once again, we have a situation where the Supreme Court seems like they are about to side with folks that want to gut voting rights, roll back civil rights, target immigrant communities, as opposed to protecting one of the most important constitutional responsibilities that we have.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: Well, I want to ask Thomas Saenz of MALDEF , Defense and Education Fund: What do you see as the—your take on how the hearing went yesterday?
THOMAS SAENZ : Well, I think it’s hard to predict from an oral argument in any case what the outcome will be. And I do think we have a chief justice who appreciates institutional integrity of the court and, more broadly, of the Constitution. I think we’ve seen him make unexpected decisions in previous cases, reflecting that belief in ensuring institutional and constitutional integrity.
And as Ari has stated, this is the most important issue that we’ve faced in decades. The census is a mandate that goes back to our Constitution’s very beginning, the direction to enumerate every decade all persons residing in the United States. And so much of what we do over the succeeding decade, from allocating seats in the House of Representatives among the states to drawing district lines, from local level up to federal level within the states, to how we distribute resources from the federal government, is determined by that enumeration. This is so integral to what we do as a democracy that I believe, when the justices have an opportunity to reflect further, we may well see a change in their initial reaction to this late-added and falsely added question to Census 2020.
AMY GOODMAN : I want to turn to Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross speaking before the House Oversight and Reform Committee in March.
COMMERCE SECRETARY WILBUR ROSS : No one’s individual data will be used for any other purpose other than the aggregations that we provide externally. So, this is not a tool as such for immigration. Our job is simply to count the people, whether citizen or not.
AMY GOODMAN : If you can respond to the substance of this, Ari Berman, but also what has come out, the corruption around who exactly proposed this, and Wilbur Ross working with Bannon and Kobach, and who they are?
ARI BERMAN : Well, Wilbur Ross is really one of the most corrupt members of the Trump administration, and his actions in the census case demonstrate this. He has lied repeatedly about why he added this question to the census in March of 2018. He said it was needed for better enforcement of the Voting Rights Act, even though the Trump administration hasn’t filed a single lawsuit to enforce the Voting Rights Act. And this question hasn’t been on the census since 1950, and the Voting Rights Act was passed in 1965. So there was no pressing need to ask this question.
He said that the Justice Department initiated this question, when memo after memo after memo shows that Ross was the one who told the Justice Department, “We need this question on the census.”
And most importantly, he said he didn’t discuss this question with the White House, but it turns out that Steve Bannon, the chief strategist of the Trump administration and the architect of the Trump administration’s white nativist strategy, put Wilbur Ross in touch with Kris Kobach, the former secretary of state of Kansas, the leading architect of laws restricting voting and immigration in the U.S., to add this question to the census. And it was Kobach who told Wilbur Ross it was essential to add this question to the census. And this is really the smoking gun, the fact that Steve Bannon, Kris Kobach, Jeff Sessions—the most anti-immigrant, the most anti-voting rights people in the country—they were the ones who were instrumental in pushing to get this question on the census. It had nothing to do about enforcing voting rights. It was all about trying to target immigrants and preserve white political power for the next decade.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Thomas Saenz, your sense in terms of the impact that this could have if the question is allowed on the census, this whole issue, as Justice Sotomayor said, that it’s almost 100% guaranteed that many, many folks, especially immigrants in the country, will not—will choose not to cooperate with the census, and the impact that this could have, especially in the climate of the Trump administration constantly raising the dangers of undocumented immigration or, as they say, “illegal” immigration in the country?
THOMAS SAENZ : Yeah, absolutely right. The climate that’s been created by this administration, the Census Bureau has known for a long time, is already creating challenges for getting folks to respond to the census. As long ago as November 2017, before the announcement of the citizenship question, the bureau was reporting to its National Advisory Committee on Racial, Ethnic and Other Populations that it was already seeing unprecedented levels of noncooperation, unprecedented levels of refusing to completely complete a questionnaire. It was seeing that because of the atmosphere created by this administration. You add to that a citizenship question, in that level of distrust that is very high with respect to this administration in communities across the country, and you have a recipe for a very serious, serious undercount.
Now, there are folks across the country, including my own organization, MALDEF , that will work very hard to try to reassure people, to try to get as complete a count as possible. The bureau itself will invest in trying to convince people to participate. But we have created headwinds through the addition of the citizenship question, in a climate of great distrust for this administration, that make it virtually a foreseen outcome that we will have a higher undercount than we otherwise should have. And the implications of that for the next decade of policymaking in this country are monstrous.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Ari, I wanted to ask you. There are some—the extreme actions that some states in particular are taking, they’re not looking solely to redistrict based on an undercount, but also determine who gets the right to vote? I mean, actually count voters rather than residents?
ARI BERMAN : This is a really important point, Juan. And I think this is one of the reasons they want to add this question about citizenship, which is that everyone is counted for the purpose of drawing districts in this country. It doesn’t matter if you’re a voter or a nonvoter. It doesn’t matter if you’re a citizen or noncitizen. Everyone is counted, because everyone deserves representation.
What conservatives want to do now is they want to redraw districts counting only citizens, or possibly counting even only voters. What that would do is it would dramatically shift power away from areas that have a lot of immigrants, places like New York and California and Texas, and then redistribute political power to whiter, more rural and more conservative areas.
AMY GOODMAN : I mean, California could lose congressional seats.
ARI BERMAN : California could lose tens of billions of dollars. California could lose congressional seats. For the first time in the history of this country, California could actually lose congressional seats in the next round of redistricting.
AMY GOODMAN : The number of people we’re talking about is something like, it’s estimated—I think Sonia Sotomayor brought it up—something like 6 million people undercounted?
ARI BERMAN : Six million people might not respond to the form. But remember, this is going to affect a lot more than that, because it’s going to affect the places where they live. So the most populous parts of this country could lose representation. And what’s happening here is, the Trump administration wants to use the census as a weapon to preserve white political power in the face of massive demographic change, because what an accurate census is going to show is the country is more diverse than ever, more nonwhite than ever. But if you can stop that from happening, then the country is more white than it should be, more conservative than it should be and more Republican than it should be.

In Malawi, public health officials are rolling out the first-ever vaccine for malaria in a historic pilot program that could save tens of thousands of lives each year. The vaccine was launched for children in Africa, where a child dies of malaria every two minutes. It took more than 30 years to develop the vaccine, which reduced the number of malaria cases by 40% in clinical trials. NYT Report: Navy SEALs Were Ordered to Remain Silent on War Crimes Apr 24, 2019
The New York Times is reporting that Navy SEALs who witnessed their platoon chief commit war crimes in Iraq were encouraged not to speak out, and told they could lose their jobs for reporting him at a private meeting with a superior officer last year. According to a confidential Navy criminal investigation obtained by the Times, the commandos said they saw Special Operations Chief Edward Gallagher stab and kill an unarmed teenage captive, shoot to death a young girl and old man, and fire indiscriminately into crowds of civilians. But when the men on Gallagher’s team called a private meeting with their troop commander and demanded an investigation, they were told to stay quiet on the matter, and no action was taken. The group of seven SEALs eventually were able to force an investigation, and Chief Edward Gallagher was arrested in September on more than a dozen charges, including premeditated murder and attempted murder. If convicted, he could face life in prison. His trial begins May 28. Topics: Drug Company Executives Criminally Charged with Trafficking Opioids Apr 24, 2019
In New York City, federal prosecutors announced criminal charges Tuesday against top executives of Rochester Drug Co-operative, a major producer of opioids, charging them with a conspiracy to profit by illegally distributing controlled substances. This is Geoffrey Berman, U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York.
Geoffrey Berman : “RDC’s former CEO , Laurence Doud, is in custody and will be presented to a judge in the Southern District of New York this afternoon. Doud is charged with conspiring to distribute oxycodone and fentanyl and with conspiring to defraud the DEA . Doud led RDC during the entire period of the charged conspiracy and, as alleged, personally directed and profited from much of its criminal activity.”
The company’s chief compliance officer also faces criminal charges. Both executives face possible life in prison. SCOTUS Hears Case on Trump Admin’s Plan to Add Citizenship Question to Census Apr 24, 2019
The U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments Tuesday in a case challenging the Trump administration’s plans to include a citizenship question on the 2020 census. Voting rights activists fear the question would deter immigrants from participating in the census, leading to a vast undercount in states with large immigrant communities. This could impact everything from the redrawing of congressional maps to the allocation of federal funding. We’ll have more on the fight over the 2020 census after headlines. Topics: Watchdog Launches Ethics Probe into Top Interior Department Officials Apr 24, 2019
The Interior Department’s watchdog has launched a major ethics investigation into six top officials, including former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke and the agency’s current head, David Bernhardt. The probe by Interior’s inspector general follows an ethics complaint filed in February alleging the officials routinely disregarded rules requiring they recuse themselves from official meetings with former employers or lobbying clients. Secretary Bernhardt is a former oil lobbyist who’s been accused of making at least 15 policy decisions that directly benefited former clients since he joined the agency in 2017. His predecessor, Ryan Zinke, resigned in December as he faced at least 17 federal investigations into his suspected ethics violations and corruption, including a criminal probe into whether he lied to Interior Department investigators. Thousands of Boy Scout Leaders Accused of Sexual Abuse Apr 24, 2019 Image Credit: Facebook: @theboyscoutsofamerica
In a growing scandal engulfing the Boy Scouts of America, it has been revealed that nearly 8,000 troop leaders have been accused of sexual abuse over the span of 72 years. These findings were announced Tuesday in Manhattan by Jeff Anderson, a lawyer representing sexual abuse victims. According to records known as the “perversion files,” Boy Scout volunteer leaders abused more than 12,000 victims between 1944 and 2016. Anderson named 130 scout leaders in New York state who had been accused of sexual abuse at Tuesday’s news conference, noting that state law had recently changed to extend the statute of limitations for childhood sex abuse. Florida Prosecutors Drop Charges Against Black Teen Brutalized by Cops Apr 24, 2019 Image Credit: Twitter: WPLGLocal10
In Florida, prosecutors have dropped charges against an African-American teenager whose brutal arrest by Broward sheriff’s deputies went viral last week after it was captured on a cellphone video. The footage shows a white officer, Deputy Christopher Krickovich, pepper-spraying 15-year-old high school student DeLucca Rolle, before slamming his head into the pavement and repeatedly punching him in the head. Krickovich and another officer have been suspended pending an investigation; a lawyer for Rolle’s family is calling for Krickovich to be criminally charged with assault and battery. Topics: Bodycam Video Shows Connecticut Police Firing on Car with Unarmed Passengers Apr 24, 2019
In New Haven, Connecticut, newly released police bodycam video shows the moment that a pair of police officers opened fire 16 times on a car. The fusillade shattered the car’s windows and left 22-year-old Stephanie Washington hospitalized for days. The car’s driver, 21-year-old Paul Witherspoon, escaped without injury. Both passengers were unarmed. The April 16 shooting spawned a series of protests, with community groups demanding Yale and Hamden police officials fire the officers, release all video of the shooting and conduct a transparent criminal investigation. The officers have yet to be charged with any crime. Topics: Disney Heiress Calls on Her Family’s Company to Fight Inequality Apr 24, 2019 Image Credit: Facebook: @abigail.disney
Walt Disney Company heiress Abigail Disney is speaking out against wage inequality, calling Disney CEO Bob Iger’s salary “insane.” In an op-ed for The Washington Post published Tuesday titled “It’s time to call out Disney—and anyone else rich off their workers’ backs,” Abigail Disney wrote, “Iger took home more than $65 million in 2018. That’s 1,424 times the median pay of a Disney worker. … At the pay levels we are talking about, an executive giving up half his bonus has zero effect on his quality of life. For the people at the bottom, it could mean a ticket out of poverty or debt. It could offer access to decent health care or an education for a child.” Floods and Mudslides Kill At Least 33 in South Africa Apr 24, 2019
In South Africa, at least 33 people are dead in the eastern province of KwaZulu-Natal after floods and mudslides crushed homes around the city of Durban. Some parts of South Africa have received over nine inches of rain since Monday—more than three times the average monthly total for all of April. Melting Arctic Permafrost Set to Cost the World $70 Trillion Apr 24, 2019
In climate news, an alarming new report published in the journal Nature Communications finds that without immediate action to curb greenhouse gas emissions, melting Arctic permafrost could add as much as $70 trillion to the overall economic impact of climate change. Meanwhile, a draft United Nations report obtained by Agence France-Presse Tuesday reveals up to 1 million species are at imminent risk of extinction due to human behavior. The report, which is set to be released on May 6, warns the accelerating loss of clean air, drinkable water and biodiversity poses a threat no less severe than climate change. 16-Year-Old Climate Activist Greta Thunberg Meets U.K. Lawmakers Apr 24, 2019
And in Britain, 16-year-old Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg called out U.K. lawmakers Tuesday for failing to act in time to avert catastrophic climate change. Thunberg was speaking to a group of MPs from Britain’s House of Commons; Prime Minister Theresa May was invited but declined to attend.
Greta Thunberg : “Now we probably don’t even have a future anymore, because that future was sold so that a small number of people could make unimaginable amounts of money. And it was stolen from us every time you said that the sky was the limit and that you only live once.”
Greta Thunberg’s appearance at the House of Commons came as climate activists with Extinction Rebellion continued a nonviolent civil disobedience campaign. This is Zuhura Plummer, a climate activist who locked herself to a truck at London’s Marble Arch landmark, with one hand bound inside a tube labeled “Greta.”
Zuhura Plummer : “Our tube is called Greta. And this is the very truck that she spoke from yesterday. And I’m doing this because I believe I have literally no other choice. I have worked on climate change for 15 years, and it felt urgent 15 years ago, my first job. And I will sit here until I am arrested, because I don’t think we have any other way of making our point. And I see myself in the long line of amazing, amazing people who have gone before us, from the suffragettes to Gandhi to the civil rights movement, and many, many, many other people around the world who are putting their bodies and their minds and their hearts on the line.”
London police have arrested over 1,000 people since Extinction Rebellion protests broke out in mid-April.

AMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! I’m Amy Goodman, with Nermeen Shaikh.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : Former Vice President Joe Biden has entered the 2020 race for the White House, becoming the 20th Democrat to seek the nomination in the largest and most diverse field of Democratic candidates to ever run for president. Biden will hold his first fundraiser tonight in Philadelphia. It will be hosted by Comcast’s chief lobbyist, David Cohen.
AMY GOODMAN : In a campaign video released on social media this morning, Biden took aim at President Trump’s response to the 2017 “Unite the Right” march of white nationalists in Charlottesville. He began by talking about Charlottesville, the home of Thomas Jefferson, and then went on to talk about what happened most recently.
JOE BIDEN : It was there in August of 2017 we saw Klansmen and white supremacists and neo-Nazis come out in the open, their crazed faces illuminated by torches, veins bulging, and bearing the fangs of racism, chanting the same anti-Semitic bile heard across Europe in the '30s. And they were met by a courageous group of Americans, and a violent clash ensued. And a brave young woman lost her life. And that's when we heard the words of the president of the United States that stunned the world and shocked the conscience of this nation. He said there were, quote, “some very fine people on both sides.”“Very fine people on both sides”? With those words, the president of the United States assigned a moral equivalence between those spreading hate and those with the courage to stand against it. And in that moment, I knew the threat to this nation was unlike any I had ever seen in my lifetime.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : That’s Joe Biden announcing his run for president. As a longtime senator from Delaware, Biden has run twice before for the Democratic nomination. The last time was in 2008, when he ultimately became then-Senator Barack Obama’s running mate. Biden’s third bid for the presidency comes in a Democratic political climate that is notably more progressive than the last time he sought the nomination.
Biden will face scrutiny for his long and checkered record in the coming weeks, including his 1994 crime bill that helped fuel mass incarceration with financial incentives to keep people behind bars. Biden has also long faced criticism for his handling of Anita Hill’s sexual harassment allegations against Supreme Court justice nominee Clarence Thomas in 1991. At the time, Biden was the chair of the Senate Judiciary committee. Biden is also known for close ties to the financial industry, notably helping push through a 2005 bill that made it harder for consumers to declare bankruptcy. According to The New York Times , the credit card issuer MBNA was Biden’s top donor from 1989 to 2010.
AMY GOODMAN : One of Biden’s key legislative achievements was the 2005 bankruptcy law that made it harder to reduce student debt, preventing most Americans from claiming bankruptcy protections for private student loans. He also voted to authorize the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003. In the weeks before Biden announced his bid for the presidency, at least seven women stepped forward to accuse him of inappropriate touching.
Well, last month, I spoke with Andrew Cockburn, Washington editor for Harper’s magazine, about Biden’s potential run for the presidency and his recent piece headlined “No Joe!”“Joe Biden’s disastrous legislative legacy” was the subtitle. I began in Part 2 of this discussion by asking Andrew Cockburn about Biden’s role in the 1994 crime bill.
ANDREW COCKBURN : He teamed up with Strom Thurmond, this sort of very aged, old segregationist from South Carolina, you know, really the face of—the face of everything that we’d been trying to get away from. And it was really, you know, Joe—he thought this was going to really propel him to the top. As he said to a former aide, who told me—I think it was around about 1990—the aide was telling me how he, Joe, was always trying to hold hearings on crime and drugs. Every week, his poor staff had to sit around dreaming up a new excuse for a hearing on crime and drugs. And as Biden said to his staffer, he said, “I want when people hear the words 'crime' and 'drugs,' I want them to think 'Joe Biden.'” I mean, he was really running, you know, like a—like George Bush Sr., on a sort of Willie Horton. You know, it’s astonishing that this man, this politician, should be considered a front-runner for the Democrats.
AMY GOODMAN : Now, could he simply say he’s changed since then, that he’s completely reversed his position?
ANDREW COCKBURN : Well, not really. I mean, he sort of—he’s flubbed on a few things. I mean, he changed—you know, he’s apologized for a few things—not, I note, on busing; not on choice, where his record is truly terrible. He has said that he’s kind of sorry, a bit sorry, about his crime legislation. And he said he’s sorry he voted for the financial deregulation, the key repeal of Glass-Steagall. He said that was the worst vote ever—ever of his entire career, which I’m—there’s a lot of competition there. So, but even if—you know, just thinking of his political viability, supposing he has to go through the campaign saying, “Well, I’m sorry I did what I did on busing. I’m sorry I did what I did on crime. I’m sorry I did what I did on banks,” he’s going to sound like another shifty politician.
AMY GOODMAN : And on Anita Hill, “I’m sorry what I did on Anita Hill”?
ANDREW COCKBURN : And Anita Hill, “I’m really sorry about Anita Hill.” He’s expressed some regret for that, I should admit. So, you know, basically, his record has very little that’s good about it. You know, he has his sort of shtick of being the friend of the working man, but, you know, he’s been a much better and closer friend of the financial industry.
AMY GOODMAN : Talk about what happened with Neil Kinnock, the speech.
ANDREW COCKBURN : Well, very bizarre, that. He, Neil Kinnock, who at that time was the leader of the Labour Party, had this standard stump speech.
AMY GOODMAN : In Britain.
ANDREW COCKBURN : In Britain, yeah, British Labour Party. And he would—in his stump speech, he would say that, you know, he was—why was it that he was the first Kinnock in a thousand years to go to college, and Mrs. Kinnock, he invoked, too, as being the first from her family to go to college. And he made a moving sort of rags-to-riches sort of piece out of that. And Biden—Biden heard this, or his speechwriter did, and thought, “That sounds good,” and simply substituted the word “Biden”: “Why am I the first Biden in a thousand years to go to college?” and so on, so forth. And, well, what’s particularly ironic about it is that Neil Kinnock was known in Britain as the “Welsh windbag,” because he went on and on. And, of course, Biden himself is a terrible windbag. So, it was really bizarre to have one windbag plagiarizing another.
AMY GOODMAN : I wanted to talk about Iraq. In 2002, former chief U.N. weapons inspector in Iraq, Scott Ritter, said, quote, “Sen. Joe Biden is running a sham hearing. It is clear that Biden and most of the Congressional leadership have pre-ordained a conclusion that seeks to remove Saddam Hussein from power regardless of the facts, and are using these hearings to provide political cover for a massive military attack on Iraq. These hearings have nothing to do with an objective search for the truth, but rather seek to line up like-minded witnesses who will buttress this pre-determined result,” Ritter said. That same year, in 2002, Senator Biden said, quote, “We must be clear with the American people that we are committing to Iraq for the long haul; not just the day after, but the decade after. … I am absolutely confident the President will not take us to war alone,” he said. Talk about the significance of that then, and then what it could mean for today.
ANDREW COCKBURN : Well, it fits into Biden’s, you know, worldview, or, well, behavior on the international stage, throughout, which is as, you know, a very hard-line hawk. You know, as you just said, or as Ritter said at the time, Biden was really doing everything he could to assist George Bush in the run-up to the illegal invasion of Iraq. You know, on the Foreign Relations Committee, he summoned just pro-invasion witnesses. As far as I know, he was certainly not one of the famous of the five senators who took the trouble to go down and read the National Intelligence Estimate, that Senator Bob Graham has talked about, which was locked away down in the basement, which would have told them that there was a lot of doubts in the intelligence community as to whether Saddam had weapons of mass destruction and so forth. No, he just—he wanted—you know, he was all for war, and he was all for occupation, as you said.
And that fits in with, you know, his record since, most notably as vice president. Obama made him, made Vice President Biden—gave him really the—well, the Iraq file, but also the Ukraine file. And Biden used that to be an ardent proponent of, you know, more arms for Ukraine, for intervention in what is really a civil war in Ukraine. Of course, his family—his son—had very extensive business ties in Ukraine, which doesn’t look too good. His son Hunter was on the board of the Ukrainian gas company. So, you know, Biden, whenever he’s been given the chance, he’s been for armed intervention. He was ardently for the expansion of NATO , the post-1990—in the 1990s, which, you know, is really the root cause of the renewed—sort of the new Cold War. I mean, Biden was there. It’s no surprise that he describes John McCain as his best friend in the Senate.
AMY GOODMAN : Biden also said, in 2002, “I do not believe this is a rush to war; I believe it’s a march to peace and security.” So, Andrew Cockburn, if you could comment on his two runs for president, both failed? You know, all the media is saying the polls show he’s the—you know, number one now, followed by Bernie Sanders. But, of course, he’s got the biggest name recognition nationally. He was vice president for eight years under President Obama.
ANDREW COCKBURN : Well, that’s right. I mean, it is largely a factor of name recognition. But also, I mean, we have to think about those two runs. And what it showed—first of all, there was, as we’ve discussed, this astonishing gaffe in 1988, where he wasn’t just plagiarizing this British politician, by the way. It turned out that his speeches also had extensive passages lifted from Robert Kennedy, Bobby Kennedy, and Martin Luther King, unbelievably. So, you know, it’s kind of—it’s hard to explain this really sort of mental issue. But then that sank his—it’s not clear that his campaign was going anywhere, anyway, at that time.
And then, in 2008, you know, he didn’t even have that excuse of a plagiarism. I mean, he made an astonishing remark about Barack Obama early on, where he described him as “clean.” I mean, it was a very sort of racist—almost racist-sounding, patronizing remark. And he got nowhere. You know, he really sputtered in his campaign, sputtered and died.
So it’s pretty bizarre to me, this sort of—this cheering squad for Biden: you know, “Run, Joe! Run!” And I think, actually, what you—clip you showed, featured, of him at the firefighters’ convention yesterday, was very telling, because sounded like I can hear Donald Trump invoking, you know, low energy again. He didn’t sound like a, you know, ready-to-go politician at all to me. He sounded sort of rather weary. I have the feeling sometimes that he—in his heart, he doesn’t want to do it. That’s why we’ve had this sort of Hamlet performance for months now. And the people around him, all these longtime aides, this is their chance for, you know, a ticket in the big game, to be in on a big-time presidential campaign, and they’re kind of pushing him into it.
Maybe I’m wrong, but I think, you know, if he does run, those poll numbers will come down in a hurry. He’s not an effective campaigner. He hates preparation. He hates like debate prep. He’s not a great fundraiser. He doesn’t like having to sort of kowtow to big donors to get money. He’s got such an inflated ego. I really think that he is not—I’m not the only person saying this; people who’ve known him for a long time think the same—that he would really—what he really wants is to be anointed—you know, “Please, Mr. Biden, please come and be our candidate. Please come and be our president”—without having to go through the hard grind, the incredible exhaustion, of a modern presidential campaign.
AMY GOODMAN : Andrew, could you talk about the media’s coverage of him? You are really among the first, if not the first one, in this period, to start really seriously analyzing Joe Biden’s record as a senator and then as a vice president. Then the rest of the media started, well, repeating some of what you had to say.
ANDREW COCKBURN : Well, yes. So, thank you. That’s kind. But that is true. But, I mean, the pack—you know, now they’re all busy at work, like CNN digging out that very damning clip you played earlier. And there’s going to be a lot more of that. I mean, already there’s things I didn’t know that are coming up. And just imagine what it’s going to be like when he has 12 other Democrats, you know, sort of chasing him around the ring. It’s going to be like Lord of the Flies or something. It’s, you know, the people—you know, oppo researchers can be pretty good these days, and there’s a lot to come out.
And he has—you know, he has so many deficiencies as a candidate, including, I should say, because the Republicans are already saying it, a “me, too” problem. I mean, if you look on sort of Republican websites and Twitter accounts, there’s a montage going around of Joe Biden with women at photo ops, including some quite young women—children, really—you know, apparently fondling them. I’m sure it’s all very just avuncular and everything, but as one person, one political fundraiser and operative, said to me—a lady said, “I was never talking to him when he wasn’t stroking my back.” You know, he’s very tactile, which, I’m sure, is entirely innocent. But, you know, don’t think that the Republicans won’t make a lot of lot of hay with that, and probably his Democratic rivals, too.
AMY GOODMAN : That’s Andrew Cockburn, Washington editor for Harper’s magazine. To see Part 1 of our discussion, go to democracynow.org.
When we come back, we look at a New York Times exposé detailing how Navy SEALs, who witnessed their platoon chief, Eddie Gallagher, commit war crimes in Iraq, were encouraged by their superiors not to speak out, and told they could lose their jobs for reporting him. Gallagher goes on trial for murder next month. We’ll speak with New York Times journalist Dave Philipps. Stay with us.

A major new investigation by Amnesty International and Airwars has revealed the U.S.-led military coalition killed more than 1,600 civilians during the 2017 offensive to oust ISIS militants from the Syrian city of Raqqa. The coalition launched thousands of airstrikes and tens of thousands of artillery strikes on the city. U.S. troops fired more artillery into Raqqa than anywhere since the Vietnam War. At the time, the United States claimed it was the, quote, “most precise air campaign in history.” Amnesty is calling on the U.S. and coalition nations to fully investigate the mass civilian casualties. Amnesty International’s Donatella Rovera traveled to Raqqa to speak with survivors.
DONATELLA ROVERA : So, this is where we are going, because this is one of the bases where U.S. forces had their artillery battery. And they were firing from there volleys of unguided artillery shells into Raqqa. I didn’t come to Raqqa with any preconceived ideas of, you know, what had or had not happened. It’s a journey of discovering what happened. When I first came to Raqqa after the war, I knew that relentless American, British and French bombardment had killed civilians and destroyed much of the city during the battle to oust ISIS . But what I came to discover was that little or no protection was afforded to the thousands of civilians who were trapped in the city.
AMY GOODMAN : While Amnesty International’s Donatella Rovera was in Syria, she spoke with a woman named Ayat, whose entire family was killed in an airstrike.
AYAT : [translated] My children, my husband, my mother, my sister, my niece, my whole family—I’ve lost them all, my dearest ones. We were sitting in the basement when the rocket hit, just before sunset. When it hit, my face was burnt by the flames. My neighbor was in front of me and was left totally charred. When I came around, my son was screaming. He was in pain, but I couldn’t help them. He was screaming, “Mommy, help me!” I told him, “I can’t, my son. I can’t help you.” I was burnt. I couldn’t do anything. I couldn’t move my hands or feet. I wasn’t able to help him. He suffered until morning and then died. Those who can afford the missiles that kill children can afford to help. What was this war? Wasn’t the goal to free civilians? They were supposed to save us, to protect our children.
AMY GOODMAN : Those were the words of a Syrian woman named Ayat. A U.S.-led coalition airstrike killed her entire family.
We go now to London, where we’re joined by Donatella Rovera, the senior crisis response adviser at Amnesty International. She was the lead investigator of the investigation by Amnesty and Airwars titled “Rhetoric versus Reality: How the 'most precise air campaign in history' left Raqqa the most destroyed city in modern times.”
Donatella Rovera, welcome to Democracy Now! Just explain the level of the devastation and the involvement of the United States.
DONATELLA ROVERA : The devastation is clear for all to see. There is not a single neighborhood in Raqqa that was spared. There is more than 11,000 buildings that were destroyed or damaged, all over the city. People are living in the middle of the ruins.
As for the level of responsibility of the United States, they were the lead party in this military operation, that involved also U.K. and French forces. But more than 90% of the airstrikes were carried out by U.S. forces, and all of the artillery strikes were carried out by U.S. forces. So, the U.S. was, by far, the overwhelming power in this military operation that caused so many civilian casualties that could have been avoided.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : Donatella, could you explain exactly what this investigation entailed and what your findings were?
DONATELLA ROVERA : We spent weeks and months in Raqqa. Just in the past year, I’ve been back to Raqqa for four times, for weeks at a time, visited more than 200 sites of coalition strikes and interviewed more than 400 witnesses and survivors and carried out on-the-ground investigation, beyond just collecting testimonies. So, for example, I went to scrap yards to find how much they had received by way of used artillery shells and other pieces of munitions. And then, as well as the on-the-ground investigation, we carried out very extensive remote sensing with our evidence lab. We had a project whereby thousands of volunteers examined more than 2 million satellite image frames. We examined every single scrap of information that was available on open sources.
And the findings of all that is that we were able to verify, on the ground, more than 640 civilian killed. And the rest, up to 1,600, are cases where we have names, where we have very strong and credible reports. The same is also—the same information has also been collected by Airwars. So, we have done a very large part of the job that the coalition should have done and has not done until now. They have not been in Raqqa investigating on the ground, speaking to survivors and witnesses, to try and find out what the impact of the military operation that they carried out has had on the civilian population.
Our investigation shows two things. First, it is not a question of some individual, isolated cases. It is way more widespread than that. Entire families, time and time again, were wiped out—10 people here, 20 people there, 30 people in another building and so on. And secondly, our investigation shows that it is possible to do this kind of investigation on a large scale in Raqqa. It is not always the case in a postwar theater, but it is possible to do so in Raqqa. Therefore, there’s no impediment, and therefore no reason why the U.S.-led coalition has not been willing to do a proper investigation so that facts can be established, they can take responsibility. Because, until now, the coalition has only admitted to roughly 10% of the civilian casualties they’ve caused. And that’s not good enough, frankly. Eighteen months have passed since the end of the war. It is time for the coalition to be transparent, to come clean, to take its responsibility for the civilian casualties that it has caused, and to provide reparation to the victims.
AMY GOODMAN : You say that U.S. marines boast they had fired more artillery into Raqqa than any time since Vietnam. One U.S. military official boasted about firing 30,000 artillery rounds during the campaign, the equivalent of a strike every six minutes for four months straight, surpassing the amount of artillery used in any conflict since the Vietnam War. Donatella?
DONATELLA ROVERA : That is deeply worrying. I mean, obviously, you know, this was said by U.S. marines on the record. It’s nothing to be proud of, because artillery is a battlefield weapon. It is not meant for urban area. Every artillery shell has a margin of error of 100 meters or more. And we all know that in a city, where there are civilians, even just 10 meters can make the difference between a legitimate military target and a house full of civilians. So, you know, artillery is cheap, but it is very costly in terms of civilian lives when used in areas around civilians. It should never be used around civilians.
And when it comes to the air-delivered munitions, the air bombardments that were carried out by the coalition forces, the munitions were precise but were very wide-impact-radius munitions, you know, big MK-type bombs that took out entire buildings. Six-, seven-floor buildings were taken out, with civilians inside. Again, those bombs are not your most sophisticated piece of kit that is at the disposal of U.S. forces. They could have used more precise, likely more expensive and requiring—more labor-intensive to use, but it would have been possible to achieve their military objectives without causing so much harm to civilians.
And secondly, the importance of the quality of the intelligence, because, ultimately, precision munitions are only as precise as the intelligence is. And the question is whether the coalition forces put all the time and resources that they should have and could have put in to verify the target, because if, time and time again, throughout the entire military operation, we had entire buildings taken out, with, you know, tens of civilians killed, something went horribly wrong. And it should be for the coalition to show an interest, 18 months after the end of the war, in understanding what went wrong, so that the same mistakes won’t be repeated the next time, because lessons should be learned from what has been a very tragic military campaign for so many families in Raqqa.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : Donatella, in that the report is also titled—I mean, as you pointed out, the air campaign used relatively precise weapons, despite the resulting devastation, irrespective of their precision, but the artillery fire resulted in so many of these civilian deaths. And the report says that Raqqa was “the most destroyed city in modern times.” You’ve spent time both in Aleppo and in Mosul, both of which, of course, were almost entirely destroyed in war, in coalition airstrikes and NATO airstrikes. Can you talk about what happened in Raqqa that distinguishes it from these two previous wars, in Aleppo and in Mosul, Iraq—Aleppo, Syria?
DONATELLA ROVERA : It’s the scale, really. In Mosul, we saw the Old City, which is a small percentage of the city, that was entirely destroyed. In Aleppo, we saw the part of Aleppo that was under rebel control that was very largely destroyed. In percentage terms, Raqqa is another story, because in Raqqa it’s not one neighborhood or a few neighborhoods. The destruction is everywhere, with, you know, the—we’ve published a map that shows satellite imagery. It’s clear to see there isn’t a single neighborhood that was spared. So, in terms of percentage—I mean, obviously, Mosul is a much bigger city than Raqqa. The destruction there was concentrated in the Old City, which is a small percentage of the city of Mosul, thankfully. And again, in Aleppo, it was part of the city. In Raqqa, the destruction is everywhere. I have been working in a conflict situation all over the Middle East and Africa for the past two decades, and I haven’t seen this level of destruction, in percentage terms, anywhere else.
AMY GOODMAN : Amnesty International’s Strike Trackers project identified more than each of the 11,000 destroyed buildings in Raqqa hit, using this project, 3,000 digital activists in 124 countries. What did they do to determine this?
DONATELLA ROVERA : Basically, we had a project that involved online volunteers examining satellite image frames to locate the precise time when each building was destroyed. And every task was performed by multiple people, so there was a lot of peer review. And then, of course, the final information was reviewed by our qualified analysts. The importance of that project was that it allowed us to scale up the analysis of a very, very large volume of satellite imagery, that was important in understanding how the battle unfolded, troop movements, where the destruction was, and against where troop movements and the front lines were. So, that was a very important component.
And that is what makes this particular investigation different than what we’ve done before. It’s a multidimensional investigation, because it involves both very extensive work investigating on the ground, but also very innovative technology and considerable resources put into the remote sensing, looking at the satellite imagery on a very large scale and all the available information on open sources. And we’ve also done this in partnership with other organizations, such as Airwars and Syrian Archive, whereby we’ve pooled together our data and the data that they had been collecting remotely throughout the time of the military operation. And we’re also visualizing this particular—the findings of this investigation in a different way. It’s not the usual report. It’s a platform. It’s a site that will be live and that contains a lot of audio-visual material that people can explore. There is 360 imagery videos.
AMY GOODMAN : And, Donatalla, we will link to it. We’ll link to it at democracynow.org.
DONATELLA ROVERA : Thank you.

AMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now!, I’m Amy Goodman, with Nermeen Shaikh.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : The New York Times is reporting that Navy SEALs who witnessed their platoon chief commit war crimes in Iraq were encouraged not to speak out, and told they could lose their jobs for reporting him at a private meeting with a superior officer last year. According to a confidential Navy criminal investigation obtained by the Times , the commandos said they saw Special Operations Chief Edward Gallagher stab and kill an unarmed teenage captive, shoot to death a young girl and old man, and fire indiscriminately into crowds of civilians. But when the men on Gallagher’s team called a private meeting with their troop commander and demanded an investigation, they were told to stay quiet on the matter, and no action was taken. The group of seven SEALs eventually were able to force an investigation, and Chief Edward Gallagher was arrested in September on more than a dozen charges, including premeditated murder and attempted murder.
AMY GOODMAN : The court-martial centers on a charge that Gallagher stabbed to death a teenage member of the Islamic State while the unarmed youth was being treated by a medic. Gallagher allegedly also photographed members of his platoon posing with the corpse, in what was dubbed a “re-enlistment ceremony.” Gallagher then reportedly texted a photo of the dead captive to another SEAL , saying, quote, “Good story behind this, got him with my hunting knife.”
According to legal filings obtained by the Navy Times , two other SEAL petty officers have said Gallagher bragged about killing, quote, “10-20 people a day or 150-200 people on deployment.” A fellow sniper told investigators Gallagher claimed, quote, “he averaged three kills a day over 80 days.” The investigation also unveiled the words “Eddie G puts the laughter in Manslaughter” were once scrawled on the wall of a kill site in Mosul, Iraq.
Gallagher’s trial begins May 28th. If convicted, he could face life in prison. The Navy has also charged Gallagher’s boss for failing to report a war crime and for destroying evidence.
Joining us now from Colorado Springs, Colorado, is the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Dave Philipps, national correspondent for The New York Times , his latest piece headlined “Navy SEALs Were Warned Against Reporting Their Chief for War Crimes.”
Dave Philipps, welcome to Democracy Now! This is an explosive piece. Tell us about how you found out, how you discovered this story, what happened to this platoon and their allegations.
DAVE PHILIPPS : Well, thanks for having me on.
The story, of course, first came to my attention when he was arrested and charged. Whenever a chief of a platoon is arrested and charged with manslaughter and murder, you immediately pay attention and try and figure out what’s going on behind the scenes, because, as grim as it may sound, it would be very easy to make this type of thing go away if everyone was on board. You can imagine a platoon in a place like Mosul. If someone wanted to kill someone who didn’t necessarily fall into the legal parameters, that could happen, and no one would say anything, if everyone was OK with it. But what struck me is that there was a schism in this platoon, where clearly there were people who were not OK with what was going on, and thought the chief had gone over the line. So, when I saw his arrest, I really wanted to see what was going on behind the scenes.
And I was lucky enough to get a really rare look at these confidential documents, about 500 pages of a Navy criminal investigation, that interviewed these SEALs, that included hundreds of text messages from the chief’s seized phone. And they really gave us an almost unprecedented look at how these things unfolded. And as you mentioned at the top, there was a lot of details in there of killing, of indiscriminate shooting.
But what also struck me, over and over again, is, you have one SEAL who is accused of doing things that went beyond the law and murdering people, but then you have seven SEALs, at least, who stood up and said, “This is wrong. Our superior is doing something wrong,” and they did what they are supposed to do. According to the documents and what they told investigators, they went to their chain of command and tried for months to get an investigation started. And they were told, I think—I don’t know what the motivation behind it was, but they were told, “Look, decompress. Don’t worry about this. This could ruin your career. You might want to think about this. This could take down other people.” And, you know, they were really frustrated that even though they saw something abhorrent, their chain of command seemed unwilling to act.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : Well, last month, President Trump tweeted, quote, “In honor of his past service to our Country, Navy Seal #EddieGallagher will soon be moved to less restrictive confinement while he awaits his day in court. Process should move quickly!” President Trump tweeted. So, Dave, can you talk about that, the fact that President Trump has intervened on his behalf? This man, as the investigation finds, is not only accused of killing a 15-year-old boy who was an ISIS captive, being treated by a medic when he was shot by Gallagher; he killed a girl in Raqqa, an older unarmed man. And even before this in Iraq, what he did in Iraq, in Afghanistan he had killed a little Afghan girl who was being held by a man who was Gallagher’s target. He shot the girl and killed both of them, to get to the man.
AMY GOODMAN : And stabbed a teenage boy.
DAVE PHILIPPS : That’s right. So, when Chief Gallagher was arrested in September, the Navy took a somewhat unusual move of asking that he be confined in the Navy brig until his trial. And the reason that they did is they say that they had found evidence that he was trying to intimidate witnesses and tamper with the investigation, and so they wanted him in a place where he couldn’t do that.
His family took up his cause—both his brother, Sean Gallagher, and his wife, Andrea Gallagher—saying, “Here’s a man who’s supposed to be innocent unless proven guilty. He hasn’t had his day in court. He has an exemplary career”—which is absolutely true—”and yet he’s being put in a cell before he’s ever found guilty of anything.” And they found that—they said that that was absolutely outrageous. They said that the reason these allegations had come out was not because the SEAL chief had done anything wrong, but because his platoon was unable to meet his exacting standards. And—
AMY GOODMAN : Actually, Dave, we have Andrea Gallagher, the wife of Navy SEAL Eddie Gallagher, speaking with WVW TV earlier this year.
DAVE PHILIPPS : Let’s listen, because this leads to why Trump intervened.
ANDREA GALLAGHER : He was named number one chief.
KAREN VAUGN : Number one chief.
ANDREA GALLAGHER : Number one platoon. He was tasked to clear Mosul, and he did it in half the time. So, when Mattis said, “Take the gloves off,” my husband listened.
AMY GOODMAN : So, that’s Eddie Gallagher’s wife. Continue, Dave Philipps.
DAVE PHILIPPS : They made this case that—in the media, and really found resonance in conservative media outlets and in conservative lawmakers. So, very quickly, a number of Republican congressmen, led by Duncan Hunter of California, signed on, you know, demanding that he be let out of the brig. And they intervened directly—or, excuse me, spoke directly to President Trump. President Trump, I believe, within a few—
AMY GOODMAN : And this is Duncan Hunter, who you just mentioned, the congressmember, Republican congressmember from California.
REP . DUNCAN HUNTER : You have lawyers, that don’t know what the word “combat” means, prosecuting guys for killing the enemy. So, even if everything that the prosecution said is true—so let’s say that Chief Gallagher killed a verified designated ISIS combatant—my answer is: “So what?” That’s his job, to close with and destroy the enemy through fire and close combat. That’s what our military does. We would not have won World War I, we would not have won World War II, if we would have fought the way that we have to fight now.
AMY GOODMAN : That’s the indicted Congressmember Duncan Hunter, the Republican from California. Dave Philipps, describe what he is on trial for—for example, the knifing to death of this 15-year-old teenager.
DAVE PHILIPPS : What his platoon members told investigators is that the chief kind of went off the rails when he got to Mosul, Iraq. They were supposed to be in an advise-and-assist role supporting Iraqi special forces. And they were supposed to do some oversight with drones and snipers. His job was to be the tactical lead, the person who sits in the back and comes up with the plans. But instead, he spent much of his time in a hidden sniper hide, where, other snipers said, he shot, depending on who you ask, three times as much or 20 times as much as other snipers.
And as you mentioned at the top, he bragged about how many people he killed. Now, a lot of that may have just been boasting. We don’t know how many of those shots actually hit anyone. But there are specifics where other snipers say they witnessed him killing what they saw as people who were clearly civilians. There was one case where a group of girls were walking along the river that runs through the center of the city. And one of the girls, wearing a flowered hijab, was shot down. And they watched her collapse and her friends drag her away. In another case, a couple of old men in wispy white beards were along the river, as well, and one of them was shot in the back. And the snipers say that in both these cases it was Eddie Gallagher who took those shots.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : And, Dave—
DAVE PHILIPPS : Now, the case that you mentioned at the top—sorry, go ahead.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : We wanted to—very quickly, before we conclude, what do expect to come of the trial?
DAVE PHILIPPS : This is going to be really hard for a prosecutor to prove, as damning as the facts seem. This wasn’t investigated until a year later because of the delays. Much of the physical evidence that might have been able to be taken was gone. There is no body for any of these murders. A lot of it comes down to testimony. And so, I think that it’s a very open question, what happens.
AMY GOODMAN : And the killing of this teenager, you were just about to say?
DAVE PHILIPPS : This is a captive. They called him an enemy, but clearly a captive fighter, someone who’s protected by the Geneva Conventions and our own laws of war. He should have been cared for, and he was, by the other SEALs. But what the SEALs say is, then Edward Gallagher came over and, without really saying anything, took out a custom knife and stabbed him in the neck and in the torso and killed him.
AMY GOODMAN : I want to thank you so much for being with us, Dave Philipps. We’ll certainly link to your exposé in The New York Times , Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, correspondent for the Times . The piece headlined “Navy SEALs Were Warned Against Reporting Their Chief for War Crimes.”
And that does it for our broadcast. I’ll be speaking at the University of California, Berkeley , and we’ll be showing our film Four Days in Occupied Western Sahara: Africa’s Last Colony . That’s Saturday at 6 p.m. at the Genetics and Plant Biology Building in Berkeley. Check our website. I’m Amy Goodman, with Nermeen Shaikh. Thanks so much for joining us.

President Trump pushed closer toward a constitutional crisis with Congress Wednesday, vowing to fight all subpoenas from House Democrats ordering current and former aides to testify on Capitol Hill. Trump’s remarks came as the White House continued to suggest the president may invoke executive privilege to prevent former White House counsel Don McGahn from testifying publicly to the House Judiciary Committee on May 21.
President Donald Trump : “Well, the subpoena is ridiculous. We have been—I have been the most transparent president and administration in the history of our country, by far. … We’re fighting all the subpoenas. Look, these aren’t like impartial people. The Democrats are trying to win 2020.”
House Oversight Committee Chair Elijah Cummings said aides who defy subpoenas could be held in contempt of Congress, warning, “These employees and their personal attorneys should think very carefully about their own legal interests rather than being swept up in the obstruction schemes of the Trump administration.” House Judiciary Chair Jerrold Nadler has suggested fining officials personally if they refuse to testify to his committee. U.S. Forces and Allies Killed More Afghan Civilians in Early 2019 Than the Taliban Apr 25, 2019
In Afghanistan, the United Nations says U.S., its NATO allies and Afghan security forces have killed more civilians so far this year than the Taliban. New U.N. figures show that, between January and March, anti-government fighters killed 227 civilians, while Afghan and international forces killed 305 civilians. The report also found U.S. and NATO airstrikes have killed 145 civilians so far in 2019—half of them women and children. U.S.-Led Coalition Killed 1,600 Syrian Civilians in Raqqa, Syria Apr 25, 2019 Image Credit: Amnesty International
Meanwhile, a major new investigation by Amnesty International and Airwars has revealed the U.S.-led military coalition in Syria killed more than 1,600 civilians during the 2017 offensive to oust ISIS militants from the city of Raqqa. Amnesty is calling on the U.S. and coalition nations to fully investigate the mass civilian casualties. After headlines, we’ll go to London to speak with Donatella Rovera, the exposé’s lead investigator. China Jails Hong Kong Activists Who Led 2014 Pro-Democracy Rallies Apr 25, 2019
In Hong Kong, hundreds of activists held a candlelight vigil Wednesday outside the prison where four protest leaders have been ordered to serve 16-month sentences for organizing pro-democracy demonstrations in 2014. Four other activists received suspended sentences, while a ninth had her sentencing trial delayed for health reasons. The so-called Umbrella Movement brought hundreds of thousands of protesters into the streets of Hong Kong to oppose the Chinese government’s plans to allow only candidates approved by Beijing to run for office. They were ultimately unsuccessful, as Chinese officials continue a rollback of the policy known as “one country, two systems” that grants greater freedoms and political autonomy to Hong Kong. Wealthy Sri Lankan Spice Trader Among Those Arrested over Easter Bombings Apr 25, 2019
Sri Lankan police are on high alert amid fresh bomb scares in the wake of Easter Sunday attacks that killed 359 people and injured more than 500 others. Overnight, authorities arrested 16 more suspects in the case. Among those arrested so far is Mohammad Yusuf Ibrahim, one of Sri Lanka’s richest spice traders. Authorities say two of his sons were among eight suicide bombers who died in Sunday’s attacks. On Wednesday, Sri Lanka’s president sacked the country’s police chief and defense secretary amid widespread reports that security forces had ample warnings about imminent attacks ahead of the bombings, but failed to act. U.N. Condemns Saudi Arabia’s Mass Execution of 37 Prisoners Apr 25, 2019
The United Nations has condemned Saudi Arabia’s mass public execution this week of 37 prisoners—some of whom were convicted based on confessions extracted through torture. This is U.N. human rights spokesperson Ravina Shamdasani.
Ravina Shamdasani : “We had concerns about confessions that had been extracted through torture. We had concerns that the due process and the fair trial rights of the individuals had not been respected. And in at least three cases, the individuals who were executed yesterday were sentenced to death when they were minors. And this is completely unacceptable in international human rights law. So we utterly condemn the executions carried out yesterday by Saudi Arabia.” Texas Executes White Supremacist Behind 1998 Lynching of James Byrd Jr. Apr 25, 2019
Back in the United States, Texas has executed one of three white supremacists convicted of killing an African-American man more than two decades ago, in a modern-day lynching that shocked the conscience of the nation and led to state and federal hate crime laws. In June of 1998, 49-year-old Jasper resident James Byrd Jr. was chained to a pickup truck and dragged to his death. James Byrd Jr. was black. The three men who murdered him were white. One of the men, John William King, was killed Wednesday evening by a prison official in Huntsville who injected him with a single lethal dose of the sedative pentobarbital. King was an avowed racist, covered in tattoos depicting Nazi imagery, a lynching and the words “Aryan Pride.” He was the second man to be executed for James Byrd Jr.’s murder. A third man serving a life sentence for the murder is due for a parole hearing in 2034. Joe Biden Enters 2020 Presidential Race Apr 25, 2019 Image Credit: YouTube: Joe Biden
Former Vice President Joe Biden has formally entered the 2020 race for the White House, becoming the 20th Democrat to seek the nomination—the largest field ever for the party. In a campaign video released on social media this morning, Biden took aim at President Trump’s response to the 2017 “Unite the Right” march of white nationalists in Charlottesville, Virginia, and the killing of anti-racist protester Heather Heyer.
Joe Biden : “It was there in August of 2017 we saw Klansmen and white supremacists and neo-Nazis come out in the open, their crazed faces illuminated by torches, veins bulging, and bearing the fangs of racism, chanting the same anti-Semitic bile heard across Europe in the '30s. And they were met by a courageous group of Americans, and a violent clash ensued. And a brave young woman lost her life. And that's when we heard the words of the president of the United States that stunned the world and shocked the conscience of this nation. He said there were, quote, 'some very fine people on both sides.''Very fine people on both sides'?”
As a longtime senator from Delaware, Biden previously ran twice for the Democratic nomination. Biden’s 1994 crime bill, while implementing sweeping gun control, also helped fuel mass incarceration with financial incentives to keep people behind bars. Biden has long faced criticism for his handling of Anita Hill’s sexual harassment allegations against Supreme Court justice nominee Clarence Thomas in 1991. At the time, Biden was the chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Biden is known for close ties to the financial industry, notably helping push through a 2005 bill that made it harder for consumers to declare bankruptcy. He also voted to authorize the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003. We’ll have more on Joe Biden’s record as a senator and vice president later in the broadcast with journalist Andrew Cockburn. Kirstjen Nielsen Warned Against Discussing Russian Election Meddling with Trump Apr 25, 2019
The New York Times is reporting that before she left her post as head of the Department of Homeland Security, Kirstjen Nielsen sought repeatedly to sound the alarm over Russian interference in the 2020 election, but was ordered not to bring it up in front of the president. As DHS secretary, Nielsen was tasked with overseeing the nation’s civilian cyberdefenses, but according to the Times, Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney made it clear that Trump still equated any public discussion of malign Russian election activity with questions about the legitimacy of his victory. Nielsen resigned earlier this month after overseeing Trump’s “zero tolerance” immigration policy that’s seen children separated from their parents and entire families held in cages resembling dog kennels. Thousands of Indigenous People Protest Bolsonaro’s Deforestation Policies Apr 25, 2019
In Brazil, thousands of indigenous peoples and their allies are rallying in the capital Brasília, protesting a massive assault on their rights and territories by ranchers, miners and the government of far-right President Jair Bolsonaro. This is Kawaua Apurina of the Apurina tribe.
Kawaua Apurina : “We are tired of being murdered. We are tired of not having our lands demarcated. We are tired of this genocide, ecocide with the indigenous peoples. We’re defending the planet!”
The protest comes as new data from the World Resources Institute show nearly 9 million acres of pristine rainforest were cut down in 2018—with most of the destruction caused by clearcutting in the Amazon. The data show deforestation is still on an upward trend, with losses accelerating in Brazil, where loggers and cattle ranchers are pressing further into indigenous territories, aided by the government. U.K., Irish Politicians Join Funeral for Murdered Journalist Lyra McKee Apr 25, 2019
And in Belfast, funeral services were held Wednesday for Northern Irish journalist Lyra McKee, who was shot in the head by an Irish nationalist militant last week during riots in the city of Derry. Leaders from both sides of Northern Ireland’s political divide appeared side by side at the funeral; they were joined by British officials and leaders from the Republic of Ireland in St. Anne’s Protestant cathedral.
At Wednesday’s funeral, a friend revealed that just hours before she was murdered, Lyra McKee said she was about to propose marriage to her partner, Sara Canning.
A group calling itself the New IRA , which opposes the 1998 Belfast Agreement peace accord, has claimed responsibility for the murder, though it didn’t identify the shooter. Ahead of Wednesday’s funeral, Sinn Féin President Mary Lou McDonald condemned the assassination.
Mary Lou McDonald : “So it’s past time now for these groups that masquerade as Republicans to pack up and pack it in, to end their activities and to let the people get on with the work of building a new united Ireland, that Ireland that we all want, an Ireland that will be a tribute to our patriot dead and to all who died, the Ireland in which Lyra McKee should have lived.” The original content of this program is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-No Derivative Works 3.0 United States License .

In Hong Kong, hundreds of activists held a candlelight vigil Wednesday outside the prison where four protest leaders have been ordered to serve 16-month sentences for organizing pro-democracy demonstrations in 2014. Four other activists received suspended sentences, while a ninth had her sentencing trial delayed for health reasons. The so-called Umbrella Movement brought hundreds of thousands of protesters into the streets of Hong Kong to oppose the Chinese government’s plans to allow only candidates approved by Beijing to run for office. They were ultimately unsuccessful, as Chinese officials continue a rollback of the policy known as “one country, two systems” that grants greater freedoms and political autonomy to Hong Kong.

In London, climate activists with the group Extinction Rebellion concluded 10 days of civil disobedience on Thursday by disrupting the center of London’s financial district. Some activists glued themselves to the entrance to the British Treasury. Others targeted Goldman Sachs, the London Stock Exchange and the Bank of England. Over the past 10 days, more than 1,100 activists have been arrested as part of the Extinction Rebellion protests. Among those arrested on Thursday was Phil Kingston, who marked his 83rd birthday by climbing onto the roof of a train.
Phil Kingston : “I’m here because I have a belief that there is something greater than us, which tells me that we don’t own this Earth. So, I am just not accepting that we treat it as though it is our just property to do with what the heck we like. And it’s doing terrible damage. The current economy is now using 1.7 Earths, and we in the human population are being taught that this is the way of life. It isn’t. It’s the way of death.

Transcript This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.
AMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report . I’m Amy Goodman, as we spend the remainder of the hour with award-winning Filipina journalist Maria Ressa, the founder of the independent news site Rappler, vocal critic of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte. Ressa has been arrested twice in recent months by the Philippines government, as Duterte cracks down on critics and the media. In February, she was detained in a cyber libel case that’s widely seen as politically motivated. She was arrested again in late March for allegedly violating a ban on foreign media ownership. Duterte has long attempted to shut down the Rappler, which has published groundbreaking work on Duterte’s deadly so-called war on drugs that’s killed thousands of people. Duterte has repeatedly described the site as “fake news.”
PRESIDENT RODRIGO DUTERTE : You are a—a fake news outlet. And I am not surprised that your articles are also fake.
AMY GOODMAN : Duterte has also called reporters who ask him tough questions “spies,” and warned that, quote, “Just because you’re a journalist you are not exempted from assassination.”
While Duterte’s government has attempted to silence Maria Ressa, her journalism has been praised around the world. In December, she was honored as one of Time magazine’s persons of the year in 2018, and just this week named one of Time ’s 100 most influential people of 2019. On Wednesday, she won the 2018 Tully Free Speech Award at the Newhouse School at Syracuse University. We are joined by Maria Ressa right now.
Congratulations on everything that you’ve accomplished. I’m not going say congratulations for going to jail, though it might be a badge of honor, because, clearly, what Duterte is doing is attacking you for representing the press in the Philippines. But talk about why he put you in jail twice in the last months.
MARIA RESSA : I think it’s just to let us—so, I was arrested twice in about five weeks and detained once. And, you know, I have to say, I think it’s just to make sure that I feel the power of the state. It’s something that—the pace of all of this has been unprecedented. And I’ve covered the Philippines for more than 30 years. In 14 months, we’ve had 11 cases filed by the Philippine government. I’ve posted bail eight times. And then it just keeps coming. We’re going to face every single one in court. And I could face decades in jail if we lose them. And one of the things that always—it just hit me a few days ago that since January 2018, when we’ve really begun facing all of this, we have not won one single motion—not one, regardless of how ridiculous the cases are.
AMY GOODMAN : Explain what he’s charging with you. What’s this foreign ownership issue, the tax issue?
MARIA RESSA : So, I think you have to look at the whole thing, and it’s about three years long now. It’s preceded by attacks on social media, astroturfing, right? It’s fake. They seed it, it grows, and people think it’s real. And the first attack is that—was actually by pro-Duterte bloggers saying that—random question by one of the ones who become a government official, underneath—she headed social media for the presidential palace. Her first question was: “Is Rappler CIA ?” It begins there. And then, what’s seeded is that Rappler is foreign-funded. The actual case is that we’re controlled by foreigners. So ludicrous, precisely because even in the Philippines we’re known for our independence.
The thing that’s most alarming for me, though, is the fast pace of something called the cyber libel charge. In this one, a story we published seven years ago, before the actual cyber libel law was enacted, is being used against us to say we violated the law that didn’t exist yet. I don’t know how else to—you know, when I first saw it, I laughed. The National Bureau of Investigation, its own lawyers threw it out. And yet, a week later, it’s resuscitated, and now it’s in court.
AMY GOODMAN : I want to go to what happened when you were just released from jail, just this small clip.
MARIA RESSA : You cannot harass and intimidate journalists to silence. We’ll stand up and fight against it. And as long as we are a democracy under a constitution, which has a bill of rights, we will demand our rights be respected.
AMY GOODMAN : So what happens to you when you are detained? And have you dealt directly with Duterte, the president of the Philippines?
MARIA RESSA : I have. I mean, the last interview I did with him was December of 2016. And the interview that I did with him in October 2015 actually helped bring him to the attention, helped the critics of President Duterte point out that Rappler, because we covered him fairly, actually helped him get elected. Certainly, he knew the power of Rappler, our millennial demographic, and that’s perhaps part of the reason that we’re under attack.
But I think there’s something far more insidious that’s happening now. It’s normalizing these attacks. You know, when you say a million times that I’m a criminal, even though it’s not true, people begin to believe. And that’s what happened first on social media: The attacks became normal. And then people who had never met me then began to believe it. Then, a year and a half later, when President Duterte comes down and says, you know, Rappler is owned by foreigners, the cases began a week later, and we’re sandwiched there.
It’s a tough place to push back, but I think it’s truly important to do that, because this is the time—I think this is a pivotal moment for Philippine democracy. This is the time when we have to fight for the rights that are guaranteed by the constitution. We have elections coming up, May 13th. And if we lose an independent Senate, I think it’s only a matter of time before the Philippines get a new constitution.
AMY GOODMAN : What does that mean, if you lose an independent Senate?
MARIA RESSA : A lot of things, that have been—we’ve had a Senate that’s been able to block certain things, like the formation—like a new—
AMY GOODMAN : So, not the same party as Duterte.
MARIA RESSA : Yes. There were enough opposition votes that they were able to stop a new constitution being ratified, all right? So, our House of Representatives—Congress is essentially a rubber stamp now. And the Senate, in the past, was holding the line. Now it looks like we’re slated to bring in an administration Senate in the May 13—on May 13th, in a few weeks’ time. If that happens, it will only be a matter of time before the House passes a new constitution, parliamentary in nature, federalism, which is something that President Duterte wants. Not saying that federalism is not democracy, but this particular draft will fundamentally change our democracy. So, for Filipinos watching, this is our last chance. You know, we may no longer be a democracy in the way that we know it.
AMY GOODMAN : So you have Duterte saying, “Just because you’re a journalist you are not exempted from assassination.” What gives you the courage to keep taking him on?
MARIA RESSA : I don’t really look at it as taking him on, you know? I do a job. My job is to hold power to account. Rappler, we do stories that the president, that—lots of people don’t like our stories. President Aquino didn’t like our stories. But that is the task of what a reporter does, right? So, his rhetoric is a noise for me. And while it does send a signal to the government bureaucracy—certainly the cases were triggered by President Duterte—it shouldn’t stop us. And certainly, we shouldn’t allow harassment, intimidation and the fear of that stop you from doing your job. So, as far as I’m concerned, we keep going, until the constitution is changed, if that’s the case, right? We demand the rights that are guaranteed not just by the Philippine constitution, but by the bill of rights. We have a constitution similar to the United States.
AMY GOODMAN : Rappler is known for exposing the so-called war on drugs, but where thousands of Filipinos have been killed.
MARIA RESSA : Can I correct how much? It’s not just thousands. And this is Michelle Bachelet at the U.N. who used this number. The latest estimate is, since July 1, 2016, until early this year, more than 27,000 people killed. That’s a U.N. estimate, right? The Philippine police will say—will admit they’ve killed more than 5,000 people. Even that number is huge. But there’s another bucket that they go off: It’s more than 30,000 homicide cases under investigation. This parsing of the details allows lies to continue.
AMY GOODMAN : And explain who is being killed. I mean, President Duterte himself has boasted about murdering people.
MARIA RESSA : He has. And before he even became president, in an interview with me—John Oliver wound up running this—he admitted he killed people, that he killed three people, and that he would continue. You know, another phrase that was used often is that, “When I’m elected, if I’m elected, the fish in Manila Bay will be fat,” because he’ll throw dead bodies in Manila Bay, right? That was the implied statement there.
Who’s being—these are not the drug dealers who are being killed. These are the poor people. These are in the poorest of the poor areas. And this is also where you can see, in statistical surveys, support in this demographic has waned President Duterte. The people who cannot defend themselves, the people who are on a list, a random list, that is not backed. There is no trial. There’s no proof that the people being killed are even drug dealers. I think this is dangerous, in a country that has no rule of law, that normalizes extrajudicial killings. We have to demand better.
AMY GOODMAN : And President Trump, his support of President Duterte, how does that affect policy in the Philippines? How does it affect you?
MARIA RESSA : Well, when President Trump called CNN and The New York Times fake news, a week later President Duterte called Rappler fake news. I think it is a bad time for the world when the former beacon of democracy, the fighter for press freedom and human rights, is noticeably absent. And I think you’re feeling that all around the world. Simultaneous to that, though, is the American technology companies that have allowed cheap armies on social media to roll back democracy, a new weapon used against journalists. This is psychological warfare, right? And when you’re attacked—
AMY GOODMAN : You’re holding up your phones.
MARIA RESSA : Yeah. When you’re attacked—at one point I was getting 90 hate messages per hour. Per hour. You can’t even—it’s a whole new thing. So, anyway, how do we deal with it? We continue doing our jobs. We demand accountability. We tell our people. And I think the problem, though, is that—I think maybe same in the United States—is, in the Philippines, fear is palpable. And if it’s not fear, it’s apathy. People want to duck until this time period is over. And I think what it—
AMY GOODMAN : Well, you clearly aren’t. And I want to thank you so much for being here. Five seconds, a message to the world about the importance of press freedom.
MARIA RESSA : Press freedom is not just for journalists. I think this is a critical time for democracy around the world, both in the Philippines and in the United States. And you must fight for your rights while you still can.
AMY GOODMAN : Maria Ressa, I want to thank you so much for being with us, founder, CEO ,executive editor of Rappler, an acclaimed Philippines news website, has been arrested twice in recent months.
I’ll be speaking Saturday night at UC Berkeley , 6:00—check our website—on the occupation of Western Sahara. I’m Amy Goodman. Thanks for joining us.

Roe v. Wade Under Threat: Planned Parenthood Pres. Speaks Out as State Laws Threaten to Ban Abortion,www.democracynow.org,mail@democracynow.org (Democracy Now!),04-26-2019,2019,4,https://www.democracynow.org/2019/4/26/roe_v_wade_under_threat_planned,"president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America and the Planned Parenthood Action Fund. Transcript This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.
AMY GOODMAN : I want to go beyond Trump’s gag rule, just the latest in a series of attacks on reproductive rights here in the United States, as 28 states, more than half the states, consider legislation to ban or restrict abortion in various ways. Among the slew of strategies are trigger bans, to make abortion completely illegal in a state should Roe v. Wade be overturned, and six-week abortion bans. Earlier this month, Ohio Governor Mike DeWine signed into law a six-week abortion ban, what some call the fetal heartbeat bill. It bans abortions once a fetal heartbeat can be detected, something that typically happens just six weeks into a pregnancy, before many women even realize they’re pregnant. The bill does not include exceptions for cases of rape or incest. A similar law is set to take effect in Mississippi in July, while judges have for now blocked these six-week bills from going into effect in Kentucky and Iowa. Can you talk more about this? And I know that you at Planned Parenthood don’t like to refer to these six-week abortion bans as “fetal heartbeat” bills, and if you can explain why?
DR. LEANA WEN : Well, I’m a doctor and a scientist, and I have to call it as it is. And what it is, what these bills are, are essentially a ban on all abortions, because, at six weeks, most women don’t even know that they’re pregnant. And we’ve seen, this year, 16 states introduce bans on abortions as early as six weeks.
And we need to call out how extreme these bans are. The bill that passed in Georgia, is expected to be signed by the governor any day now, allows the state to investigate women for miscarriages. In Alabama, there is a bill that would impose a Class A felony on doctors, sentencing doctors who perform abortions to up to 99 years in prison. There was a bill in Texas—that failed—but that bill would have the—would impose a death penalty, capital punishment, the death penalty, for women who seek abortion care. And more than 300 people came to testify in favor of this bill that would impose the death penalty on women.
If there’s any doubt about what’s happening around the country, we just have to look at the legislation that’s been introduced this year, and what politicians, these anti-women’s health politicians, are saying about it. They are saying, blatantly, boldly, that what they are trying to do is to overturn Roe v. Wade . They want for these extreme bills to make their way up to the Supreme Court to overturn Roe . And that’s what’s at stake here. What’s at stake is the right to safe, legal abortions. And we know what happens when that right is taken away, because we have the examples around the world and we know what happened in the U.S. pre- Roe , which is that thousands of women died. And we cannot go back to that time.
And that’s why Planned Parenthood is fighting back with everything that we have. We are opposing these rules. We’ve fought back many of these bad bills. And we’re also working with our champions across the country to protect and expand the right to reproductive healthcare, because we know that reproductive healthcare and women’s healthcare must be treated as what they are, which is healthcare, and that the vast majority of the American people support women making their own healthcare decisions, not politicians telling women and families what we should be doing with our health and our bodies.
AMY GOODMAN : Dr. Leana Wen, we want to thank you so much for being with us, president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America and the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, first physician to lead the organization in nearly 50 years, also the first Asian American and first immigrant ever to hold that office.
When we come back, we’ll spend the remainder of the hour with the award-winning Filipina journalist Maria Ressa, founder of the independent news site Rappler, a vocal critic of the Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, who has just imprisoned her twice.

"Planned Parenthood President: Trump's ""Pro-Life"" Agenda Is Killing Thousands in the U.S. and Globally",www.democracynow.org,mail@democracynow.org (Democracy Now!),04-26-2019,2019,4,https://www.democracynow.org/2019/4/26/planned_parenthood_president_trumps_pro_life,"president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America and the Planned Parenthood Action Fund. Links Transcript This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.
AMY GOODMAN : Well, I want to turn to the Trump administration’s attack on reproductive rights here in the United States. A second federal judge has blocked a gag rule that would have stripped federal funding known as Title X for Planned Parenthood and other clinics that refer patients for abortion or even mention abortion as an option. The judge’s ruling halts the gag rule, which was announced by President Trump in February and was scheduled to go into effect May 3rd. Washington state Federal Judge Stanley Bastian ruled against the changes to Title X funding Thursday, saying they would require clinics “to face a Hobson’s choice that harms patients as well as the providers.” This came two days after an Oregon judge issued a preliminary injunction to stop the gag order from going into effect, calling the rule a “ham-fisted approach to public health policy.” Oregon Federal Judge Michael McShane said, quote, “At the heart of these rules is an arrogant assumption that the government is better suited to direct women’s health care than their providers,” he said.
Title X covers non-abortion services like STD prevention, cancer screenings, contraception; provides over $280 million in funding for 4 million mostly low-income women every year.
Talk about the significance of what happened this week in two states, two federal judges saying no to the Trump administration, and what the Trump administration is trying to do with this gag order that was supposed to go into effect next week, Dr. Wen.
DR. LEANA WEN : What the Trump administration is trying to do with this gag rule is to prevent doctors from fulfilling our ethical obligation. When I became a doctor, I took an oath that I would always provide honest, full and accurate information to my patients. To restrict what I can say, to have the Trump administration or any politician telling me what I can and cannot say to my patients, is just unethical, unconscionable and, frankly, unthinkable. This is the reason why over a hundred medical, nursing, public health groups, including the American Medical Association, American Nurses Association, American Public Health Association, have stood up in strong opposition to this Title X gag rule, because we know that it would force us to compromise the oath that we took to serve our patients, and also that it would not happen for any other aspect of healthcare. I mean, how ludicrous would it be if doctors now cannot tell our patients who come for insulin and who have diabetes—if we cannot tell them about where they can go to get insulin, a life-saving and life-changing treatment?
And so, this ruling is important because it is a preliminary injunction that blocks this gag rule from taking effect. It also continues to allow Planned Parenthood and other health centers to continue serving millions of patients around the country who depend on us for primary and preventive services. As you said, Amy, Title X provides for affordable birth control, breast and cervical cancer screenings, STI treatment, HIV testing. In many parts of the country, this is the only way that individuals with low income, who live in rural areas, are able to get access to healthcare. And taking that away, we know the consequence, which is that people are going to delay getting healthcare. Cancers are going to end up getting diagnosed later. There will be increased rates of STIs and unintended pregnancies. That’s what happens when people cannot get the reproductive healthcare that they need.
AMY GOODMAN : So, again, give us the scenario. A woman comes into your office, and she says, “What are my options?” If this gag rule were in effect, if she’s just learned that she was pregnant, you, as a doctor, would not be able to even say—forget referring her somewhere or to a Planned Parenthood clinic even, you couldn’t even say, “Your options are keeping the baby or terminating the pregnancy”? You couldn’t say “terminating the pregnancy,”“abortion”?
DR. LEANA WEN : Well, here’s the thing. Congress has made it very clear, by passing laws about it before, that physicians and nurses and providers must be able to provide the full range of options, because that’s what medicine is about. It’s not up to me as the doctor to tell my patients what they should do. My obligation is to provide all the information and empower my patients to make the best decisions for themselves.
Under this gag rule, if a patient came to me and I work at a clinic that receives Title X federal funding, I would not even be able to provide a referral to a woman even if she’s specifically asking for a referral for abortion care. And it’s not even clear what I would be allowed to do if it’s medically necessary in order to save her health; if she has a life-threatening condition, a condition that threatens her health, if I’m able to make referral in that case.
And I want to point out not only how unethical this is, but also how discriminatory it is, too, because this is saying that if you are a person who’s wealthy, if you have private insurance, you can still go to your doctor and get accurate medical information and the healthcare that you need. But if you are a woman of low income, if you are a family with low income, not only can you not get healthcare access, but you would not even be able to get accurate information from your doctor. This is just one more example from the Trump-Pence administration of a discriminatory policy that would worsen health outcomes and worsen disparities for those who already face disproportionate barriers to care. The people who receive Title X are those who are uninsured, those who live in out-of-the-way, rural areas. It’s people of color. It’s people who already face these barriers.
And it also puts providers into an impossible position, because either you continue to serve patients or you’re forced to compromise your ethics. And from our standpoint in Planned Parenthood, we cannot accept these gagged funds. We would never force our doctors to censor themselves. We would never provide care to our patients that’s anything less than full, accurate, honest, the same compassionate, high-quality, nonjudgmental care that we provide through our 600 health centers across the country now.
AMY GOODMAN : I wanted to ask about the global gag rule. Shortly after his inauguration in January 2017, President Trump reinstated this controversial global gag rule, the policy originating in the Reagan era banning U.S. funding for any international healthcare group that performs abortion, advocates for the legalization of abortion or even mentions it, even if those activities are funded by non-U.S. money. Then-White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer commented on that decision.
PRESS SECRETARY SEAN SPICER : Well, I think the president, it’s no secret, has made himself—made it very clear that he’s a pro-life president. He wants to stand up for all Americans, including the unborn. And I think the reinstatement of this policy is not just something that echoes that value, but respects taxpayer funding, as well, and ensures that we’re standing up not just for life, for life of the unborn, but for also taxpayer funds that are being spent overseas to perform an action that is contrary to the values of this president, and, I think, continue to further illustrate, not just to the folks here in this country, but around the world, of what a value we place on life.
AMY GOODMAN : So, that’s a familiar voice to many, though no longer there, the former press spokesperson for President Trump, Sean Spicer. Dr. Leana Wen, what this means globally, and also for the many groups, explain Planned Parenthood Federation of America’s role globally.
DR. LEANA WEN : Well, I just have to point out the hypocrisy here, because if we truly were to value life, we would be looking to expand access to healthcare, not gut it. Let’s look right here in the U.S. as an example. We have rising maternal mortality right here in the U.S. American women are 50% more likely to die in childbirth than our mothers were. We are the only industrialized country where maternal mortality is going up. African-American women in the U.S. are three to four times more likely to die in childbirth and thereafter than white women. A woman in Georgia is 10 times more likely to die in childbirth than a woman in California. Look at what this administration is trying to do right here in the U.S., which is cutting healthcare access, taking away access to birth control, taking away and sabotaging the Affordable Care Act, that provides care to women, that also allows for women to receive care in pregnancy, and gutting, dismantling Medicaid, that provides care to low-income women, families and children.
I mean, there’s huge hypocrisy right here in the U.S., but that hypocrisy we’ve seen time and time again, and actually first with this Trump-Pence administration’s policies globally. One of the first things that this administration did was to reinstate and expand the global gag rule. And we’ve already seen the impact of this gag rule, because they have taken away funding from clinics, health centers, organizations, that even offer information about abortion care and the full spectrum of reproductive healthcare, which is what abortion is. Abortion is a standard medical procedure that’s part of the full spectrum of reproductive healthcare. And for many people, it is lifesaving. It is a critical procedure. It is a critical part of modern medicine. We’ve seen what happens when people, internationally, do not have access to safe, legal abortions. Actually one-tenth of maternal mortality globally is due to unsafe abortions. Thirty thousand women die every year around the world because they do not have access to safe, legal abortions.
And by the Trump-Pence administration imposing a global gag rule, not only are they worsening maternal mortality globally, in the U.S., what they’re also doing, too, is to take away funding from organizations that provide care for patients with HIV / AIDS , that look to prevent STIs and HIV worldwide. And there are health centers and clinics and organizations that have had to close their doors around the world, that provide food and nutrition assistance to families, that provide care to individuals with HIV infection. And what this Trump-Pence administration is doing is worsening health. And so, I find it extremely hypocritical that they get to call themselves “pro-life,” when what they are doing is worsening health outcomes and leading to more people dying in the U.S. and around the world.

"""A Shameful Week for the U.S."": Trump Admin Guts U.N. Resolution to End Rape as Weapon of War",www.democracynow.org,mail@democracynow.org (Democracy Now!),04-26-2019,2019,4,https://www.democracynow.org/2019/4/26/a_shameful_week_for_the_us,"president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America and the Planned Parenthood Action Fund. Transcript This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.
AMY GOODMAN : The Trump administration is under fire after the United Nations Security Council passed a resolution to end rape as a weapon of war on Tuesday that excluded any mention of sexual and reproductive health. The resolution was gutted after the U.S. threatened to veto the measure altogether unless language referencing reproductive health was taken out due to the Trump administration’s belief the language was code for abortion. The watered-down measure also weakened references to the International Criminal Court, making it harder for women and girls to seek justice.
France’s U.N. ambassador blasted the move, saying, quote, “It is intolerable and incomprehensible that the Security Council is incapable of acknowledging that women and girls who suffered from sexual violence in conflict, and who obviously didn’t choose to become pregnant, should have the right to terminate their pregnancy.”
The resolution was championed by Nobel Peace laureate Nadia Murad, a Yazidi Kurdish human rights activist from Iraq. She was kidnapped by the self-proclaimed Islamic State and held as a sex slave for almost three months.
NADIA MURAD : [translated] We come here today and ask that those perpetrators of genocide be brought to justice. They used Yazidi women as a weapon of war, hence they need to be tried before a special court so that they would be tried for the crimes they committed. Bringing elements of ISIL to justice in the framework of an international tribunal, that tries them for crimes of genocide and sexual violence against women, would send messages to others and prevent such crimes in the future.
AMY GOODMAN : And this is human rights attorney Amal Clooney addressing the Security Council on Tuesday.
AMAL CLOONEY : This is your Nuremberg moment, your chance to stand on the right side of history. You owe it to Nadia and to the thousands of women and girls who must watch ISIS members shave off their beards and go back to their normal lives, while they, the victims, never can.
AMY GOODMAN : The gutted resolution is just the latest in the Trump administration’s hard-line stances on U.N. resolutions. In recent months, they’ve also opposed using the word “gender” in U.N. documents, in what is seen as an attack on transgender rights.
We’re joined now by Jessica Neuwirth, the director of the Human Rights Program at Roosevelt House at Hunter College, the director of the Sisterhood Is Global Institute. She sent a letter Wednesday to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo protesting the U.S. stance on the Security Council resolution on sexual violence in conflict. Jessica Neuwirth has worked as a consultant to the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda on issues of sexual violence in several cases, including a landmark decision recognizing rape as a form of genocide.
Jessica Neuwirth, welcome to Democracy Now! So, talk about what happened at the United Nations this past week.
JESSICA NEUWIRTH : Well, I have to say, it was really a shameful week for the United States. Ten years ago, it was the United States that pioneered the resolution that created an office to deal with sexual violence in conflict and a special representative of the secretary-general at a very high level. And the goal of the 10-year anniversary resolution was to strengthen the mechanisms and move the agenda forward. And while in the end it did that, in some important respects, most of the energy, instead of reinforcing political will, was used to battle this assault by the United States and its continuing threat to veto the resolution, in part because of the language “sexual and reproductive health,” because of references to the International Criminal Court—all the mechanisms that actually do strengthen the work of the U.N. and others around the world to stop sexual violence in conflict, and then, of course, on the sexual and reproductive health, I mean, the services that are most needed by women and girls who have been raped in war zones.
AMY GOODMAN : So, can you talk about the origins of this resolution, that originally Germany put forward, right?
JESSICA NEUWIRTH : Germany sponsored the resolution, and, as I said, it was really designed to move the agenda forward. And we’re used to seeing the United States in the U.N. also try to move these agendas forward. And this time around, what we saw was the United States lining up with China and Russia against its allies, its closest allies, like France, Belgium, Germany, the U.K., really blocking efforts to get the resolution passed. And it was only because of the really dramatic compromises that were made that the resolution in the end did pass. And as I said, there are some good things in the resolution that we don’t want to ignore, but it was really shameful, you know, to be an American walking around the halls of the U.N.
AMY GOODMAN : So, the United States forced the U.N. Security Council to remove the words “sexual and reproductive health,” to which people like the French ambassador was outraged, in response saying this is just unacceptable?
JESSICA NEUWIRTH : It was a rare moment for ambassadors to be openly voicing that kind of disappointment. The U.N. is a very diplomatic place. But following the passage of the resolution, not only the French, but the South Africans, the Belgians, the British really spoke very strongly.
AMY GOODMAN : Let me go to the British. The United Kingdom’s special representative on preventing sexual violence in conflict, Tariq Ahmad, addressed the United Nations Security Council Tuesday.
TARIQ AHMAD : We regret that the language on services for survivors of sexual violence recognizing the acute need for those services to include comprehensive reproductive and sexual healthcare, including safe termination of pregnancies, did not meet with all the councilmembers’ support. However, Mr. President, it is important that we maintain effort, our consistent efforts, in this respect, and we maintain that progress that we have made on this issue.
AMY GOODMAN : And this is the French ambassador to the United Nations, François Delattre, also speaking Tuesday.
FRANÇOIS DELATTRE : [translated] In the face of certain threats, I would still like to underscore how essential it is, for France and in the name of victims, to ensure that these victims can have access to sexual and reproductive health. This is an essential point.
AMY GOODMAN : That was the voice of the translator. Jessica Neuwirth?
JESSICA NEUWIRTH : Yes, and the South African ambassador, I would say, went even further and noted the hypocrisy of adopting a survivor-centered approach, which was one of the wonderful things about this resolution, that it really tried to put survivors at the center of all efforts to combat sexual violence in conflict, and yet, at the same time, denying them the services or our right to access services that are so vitally needed. So, I think what he said was that the message to survivors is that consensus in the U.N. is more important than their needs, despite the fact that the U.N. had just said that their needs should be central to any effort.
AMY GOODMAN : Now, this is nonbinding, but talk about the effects of this on the ground—you’ve long worked on these issues of sexual violence—and what it means to address sexual and reproductive health.
JESSICA NEUWIRTH : Well, the most important thing, which is true for all of these resolutions, many of which have really important and great ideas in them, is to see them get implemented. And so, I think how it will play out on the ground is actually going to depend on how much political will there really is to implement these mechanisms that exist, even though we weren’t able to create more mechanisms. I think one of the important things in the new resolution is a greater support for sanctions for perpetrators. So, I think we have to see: Are these perpetrators actually going to be sanctioned? And can we use the existing tools, which, by and large, have not been effective to date, not because they can’t be effective, but because they just haven’t been used properly? So, I think that what the survivors said, or what Dr. Mukwege, who works closely with survivors, and Nadia Murad said—
AMY GOODMAN : And Dr. Mukwege, of course, of the Democratic Republic of Congo, together with Nadia Murad, are both this year’s Nobel Peace Prize winners—well, the award given in 2018. And both attended this hearing.
JESSICA NEUWIRTH : They both attended. They both spoke very strongly on behalf of survivors and the need for justice. And so, I think what matters the most in the end is what happens after. You know, are these just empty words and a battle over words, or can we really move forward with what is in the resolution, honor the survivors and support them in many ways, including with sanctions and efforts to bring the perpetrators to justice?
Another important point in the resolution that’s new is a focus and, for the first time, a mention of children born of rape. Around the world in these conflict zones, there are children born of rape who face many particular problems. And there is a report coming out, thanks to this resolution, that will focus on their needs and their issues.
AMY GOODMAN : And your letter to Secretary of State Pompeo?
JESSICA NEUWIRTH : I wrote to Secretary Pompeo in a moment of tremendous frustration, because it just was—it was just horrifying to watch this destructive effort, which at various points in time seemed like it really could torpedo the entire resolution, which was only saved because of the major compromises that were made, that were so disturbing to so many of us. And so, you know, I just pointed out that the United States had an authorship role in all of this work and that it was such a reversal. And I think we have to remember the context. These are girls and young women who are being raped by ISIS terrorists or Boko Haram, and the first thing they need is reproductive healthcare. And if they become pregnant, the idea that they would be forced to carry to term that pregnancy from rape, caused by rape, has been found by the United Nations and other fora to constitute a form of torture.
AMY GOODMAN : And can’t help but note that President Trump—right?—the world leader who is pushing this forward and taking out references to sexual reproductive health, himself has been accused of sexual harassment and sexual assault by at least 16 women.
JESSICA NEUWIRTH : I think the insensitivity—that’s probably a kind word, the “insensitivity”—of the administration to the needs, in general, of women, even here in this country, but in particular, again, the sort of dire circumstances of these women who are facing the most brutal mass rapes, is really just—it leaves me speechless.
AMY GOODMAN : Well, I want to thank you so much for being with us. Last question. You were sitting right behind Nadia Murad at the U.N. Security Council hearing. The Murad rule that the U.K. is expected to launch, the Murad Code?
JESSICA NEUWIRTH : The U.K. has been a real leader in efforts to raise attention and awareness to the issue of sexual violence in conflict and to come up with various codes of conduct and remedial mechanisms. So, I think that effort will be continuing. There’s a big conference later this year.
AMY GOODMAN : Well, we will certainly cover that. Jessica Neuwirth, I want to thank you for being with us, director of the Human Rights Program at Roosevelt House, Hunter College, also the director of Sisterhood Is Global Institute, and sent a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo protesting the U.S. stance on the Security Council resolution on sexual violence in conflict. Jessica Neuwirth has worked as a consultant to the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda on issues of sexual violence in several cases. I want to thank you so much for being with us.
When we come back, we’re going to get response from Dr. Leana Wen, who is the new president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, and also talk with her about the Title X rulings that have come down this week. We’ll talk about the gag rule and the global gag rule. Stay with us.
[break]
AMY GOODMAN : “Blackbird” by Nina Simone. This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report . I’m Amy Goodman, as we turn to the new president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Dr. Leana Wen. She was just honored by Time magazine this week as one of Time 100, the most influential people of 2019.
Before we talk about Title X, I wanted to get your response, Dr. Wen, to what just took place at the U.N. Security Council, a resolution that was passed 13 to 0 on sexual violence against women, rape against people in war zones, but the U.S. gutting that resolution, taking out any reference to sexual and reproductive health.
DR. LEANA WEN : I have treated women who were infected with HIV as a result of rape during the war. I’ve helped women who were the victims of sexual torture, with clubs and bayonets, and had fistulas and required lifesaving support. What we need to do for these women who are victims of war and horrific situations is to provide them with the care that they need. And excluding sexual and reproductive healthcare undermines their ability to get that care.
It’s time for us, as the U.S., to value women’s rights as human rights. And what this Trump-Pence administration has consistently shown, globally and in the U.S., is that they do not value women’s lives. And the policies that they are championing are, frankly, oppressive. They counter best practices when it comes to public health. And frankly, they are misogynistic.

In Sri Lanka, government officials have lowered the death toll from the Easter Sunday attacks on churches and hotels to about 253. That’s more than 100 lower than the previous estimate. Authorities said there were so many body parts at the bombing sites it was difficult to obtain a precise death toll. More than 500 people were injured. Over the past day, Sri Lanka’s top police official and defense secretary have both resigned in response to the government’s failure to follow up on warnings that an attack was imminent. Anita Hill: I Am Not Satisfied by Biden’s Apology over Handling of Clarence Thomas Allegations Apr 26, 2019 Image Credit: Facebook: @ProfAnitaHill
Former Vice President Joe Biden recently reached out to Anita Hill prior to entering the presidential race. Biden has long been criticized for his handling of Hill’s allegations that now Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas had sexually harassed her in the workplace. Biden was chair of the all-male, all-white Senate Judiciary Committee in 1991 when Hill testified. He forced Hill to discuss in graphic detail Thomas’s sexual comments, and he did not invite other women to testify who could have corroborated Hill’s allegations. Anita Hill told The New York Times she was not satisfied with Biden’s comments during their phone conversation. Hill said, “I cannot be satisfied by simply saying, ’I’m sorry for what happened to you.’ I will be satisfied when I know there is real change and real accountability and real purpose.” Topics: As Comcast Lobbyist Hosts Biden’s First Fundraiser, Campaign Boasts of Support from “Top 1%” Apr 26, 2019
In other campaign news, Biden marked his first day on the campaign trail by attending a $2,800-per-person fundraiser in Philadelphia at the home of Comcast’s top lobbyist, David Cohen. Attendees included Daniel Hilferty, chief executive of Independence Blue Cross, the largest health insurer in the Philadelphia area. Senator Bernie Sanders criticized Biden for holding a fundraiser in the home of a corporate lobbyist. Former Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell, who co-hosted the Biden fundraiser, appeared on CNN this morning, and said the fundraiser attracted the top 1%.
Ed Rendell : “For 90% of the people who attended last night’s fundraiser, they’re contributing against their own financial interest. They will do better with a Republican president, because they’re in the top 1%. So they’ll do better with a Republican president. It will probably cost them money if Joe Biden wins, because I think he’ll bring some sense to the tax cut and he’ll probably raise rates on the top 1%. So, all these people gave money even though it was against their own financial interest.” Topics: Biden Hires Ex-Bernie Sanders Staffer as Senior Adviser Apr 26, 2019 Image Credit: Gage Skidmore
In other campaign news, Biden has hired Symone Sanders to be a senior adviser to his campaign. Sanders is a prominent African-American political strategist who served as press secretary for Bernie Sanders’ presidential run in 2016. Last month, Symone Sanders donated $250 to the campaign of Pete Buttigieg. Topics: Hundreds of Thousands Protest in Sudan Demanding Civilian Rule Apr 26, 2019
In Sudan, hundreds of thousands of protesters gathered outside Sudan’s Defense Ministry Thursday calling for civilian rule following the recent military coup that ousted Omar al-Bashir. About 100 Sudanese judges joined the protests, chanting, “Civilian, civilian, protected by the judiciary.” In a concession to the protesters, three prominent Sudanese generals have agreed to resign from the ruling Transitional Military Council. Protesters are vowing to stay in the streets until military rule has ended.
Awad al-Bashir : “All of our demands have been carefully studied, are well known, and we insist on them. We will not leave this sit-in until all our demands are met, at the forefront of which is a civilian government.” Topics: North Korea’s Kim Jong-un Accuses U.S. of Acting in Bad Faith in Nuke Talks Apr 26, 2019
North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has wrapped up his first-ever meeting with President Vladimir Putin. Kim criticized the United States for acting in bad faith during his recent nuclear summit with Trump and warned that the situation on the Korean Peninsula could return to what he described as its “original state.” On Thursday, Putin said the international community—not just the United States—should be involved in negotiations on North Korea’s nuclear program. Topics: In Response to Yellow Vest Protests, Macron Vows to Cut Taxes, Tells Nation It Must Work Harder Apr 26, 2019
French President Emmanuel Macron has vowed to cut taxes and increase pensions as part of a package of reforms aimed at quelling the 6-month-old yellow vest protests. Macron outlined his proposals in an over two-hour press conference in which he also told French workers they must work harder. Topics: Report: U.S. Sanctions Have Killed 40,000 in Venezuela Since 2017 Apr 26, 2019
More than 40,000 people have died in Venezuela since 2017 as a result of U.S. sanctions. That’s the conclusion of a new report by the Center for Economic and Policy Research and the economist Jeffrey Sachs. The report examines how U.S. sanctions have reduced the availability of food and medicine in Venezuela and increased disease and mortality. Jeffrey Sachs said, “American sanctions are deliberately aiming to wreck Venezuela’s economy and thereby lead to regime change. It’s a fruitless, heartless, illegal, and failed policy, causing grave harm to the Venezuelan people.” Topics: Second Judge Blocks Trump’s Title X “Gag Rule” on Abortion Apr 26, 2019
In the second time this week, a federal judge has blocked a new rule that would have stripped federal funding known as Title X for Planned Parenthood and other clinics that refer patients for abortions or even mention abortion as an option. U.S. District Judge Stanley Bastian of Washington state ruled against the changes on Thursday, saying they would require clinics “to face a Hobson’s choice that harms patients as well as the providers.” The judge’s ruling halts the so-called gag rule, which was announced by President Trump in February and was scheduled to go into effect on May 3. This came two days after an Oregon judge issued a preliminary injunction to stop the gag order from going into effect. Topics:"

AMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report . I’m Amy Goodman, with Part 2 of our interview with Maria Ressa. She’s the founder, CEO and executive editor of Rappler, the acclaimed Philippines news website. Maria Ressa has been arrested twice in recent months by the Philippines government, as President Duterte cracks down on critics and the media. In February, she was detained in a cyber libel case that’s widely seen as politically motivated. She was arrested again in late March for allegedly violating a ban on foreign media ownership. She’s here in New York City after being named one of Time magazine’s 100 most influential people of 2019, joining us now for Part 2 of our discussion.
Can you talk about the “matrix,” Maria?
MARIA RESSA : I wish it was a movie. Just this week, it looks like, we’ve escalated fantasyland, right? But the presidential palace—so, it was first seeded as a story in a pro-government newspaper, that’s run by the head of international public relations for President Duterte. It alleges that a group of independent news sites, including Rappler and the Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism, which was founded by Sheila Coronel, who is now a dean at Columbia Journalism School here—that Sheila and I and others, who are independent journalists, are plotting to oust President Duterte, as in coup plotters, right?
They released a “matrix.” They’re calling it the “matrix,” but a very crude link analysis—expensive software that tries to make fantasy look like a reality. We reacted very quickly. It’s just—it’s fantasy. And everyone else—the focus of this was Ellen Tordesillas, who runs Vera Files, also another accredited fact-checker by Facebook in the Philippines. It’s a concerted attack. When government says something, regardless if it’s a blatant lie, people listen to it. And so, this opens up a whole new can of worms. You know, the—
AMY GOODMAN : And you, of course—you and Rappler, again, are on this list.
MARIA RESSA : Yes. I’m still there, along with some of our board directors. It looks like someone just took a list of the directors of Rappler and plastered it onto this matrix. The problem is that they’ve already seeded things like the Department of Justice saying, no, they won’t file cases. Who asked them whether they should file cases? And then the Philippine National Police has said that they’re going to proactively investigate the journalists and the people named on this fantasy list. It’s like inception, you know? And I guess that makes me both angry and embarrassed for the Philippine government.
AMY GOODMAN : And, of course, I mean, in naming all these journalists and journalistic organizations, with Duterte calling reporters who ask him tough questions “spies,” and, again, saying, “Just because you’re a journalist you are not exempted from assassination,” it’s like a hit list.
MARIA RESSA : You can see it all converging. Correct. So, this is kind of—the drug war, President Duterte released a narco list—right?—his list of people in the drug war. Very quickly, journalists pointed out that some of the people named in that list, A, are dead, B, are not where they’re supposed to be. It’s very easy to fact-check this matrix and show that it isn’t true. But there are already repercussions, when the police begin to investigate you. I mean, why would they even investigate? There isn’t any evidence. But this is how things are set in motion.
AMY GOODMAN : This is President Duterte speaking to your news organization, Rappler, in October of 2015, when he was the mayor of Davao City, before he was president. He’d been accused of running death squads.
MAYOR RODRIGO DUTERTE : I must admit that I have killed. Three months early on, I killed about three people.
AMY GOODMAN : So, that’s, at the time, Mayor Duterte—
MARIA RESSA : Correct.
AMY GOODMAN : —now president, talking to you—
MARIA RESSA : Yeah.
AMY GOODMAN : —boasting about killing three people.
MARIA RESSA : This was in October of 2015.
AMY GOODMAN : You think this helped get him elected president?
MARIA RESSA : Sadly, I believe so. And looking back on it, you know, I asked the tough questions, but I didn’t drill. And I think one of the most interesting things in that is partly because he was refreshing. He admitted. Who admits to you on camera that they killed people, right?
But then, beyond that, let’s take a look at what the propaganda machine has done. President Duterte faced human rights charges of—it’s something called DDS , that he ran the Davao Death Squad. After the propaganda machine kicked into motion, DDS had a new meaning, because they just astroturfed it. It became Duterte Diehard Supporters. And I guess that goes to how all these attacks continue. Because they control the pipeline of information and they use social media effectively, they’re able to turn white to green, and something that was a negative has now become a positive.
AMY GOODMAN : So, talk about the recent decision of the Philippines’ highest court ordering Duterte, the government, to release documents relating to thousands of deaths linked to his so-called war on drugs.
MARIA RESSA : The executive office has kind of pushed back. Every time the government or journalists have asked for any kind of documentation in this war on drugs, where tens of thousands—27,000, according to the U.N.'s latest estimate—have been killed since July 2016. So the Supreme Court recently ruled that they would need to release the documents. And we've seen the first group. And what it’s shown is that there is incomplete records, that the criminal cases have not been filed and that more needs to get done. But that’s a minor victory, right?
And that’s part of the reason, shortly before that decision, Rappler decided to go to the Supreme Court on a press freedom issue. And I hope that other Filipino journalists are going to be joining this case. It’s a case that Rappler has been banned from coverage of the presidential palace for 14 months now.
AMY GOODMAN : What do you mean?
MARIA RESSA : President Duterte, literally, when he didn’t like a corruption story we had—it alleged corruption against his aide, who is now running for the Senate—he just unilaterally banned our reporter. So she walked into the palace, and the guard prevented her from coming in. There was confusion, no written order, but we were banned from the palace. Then, in succeeding months, we were banned from any event, even if it’s private, anywhere in the Philippines where President Duterte speaks. And what really triggered our case was when there was a campaign rally and President Duterte was speaking, and they threw our reporter out. So, we came in. We filed this case three weeks ago with the Supreme Court, hoping that they will pick it up. And it looks like at least the journalism community in the Philippines will come and support it. So, that’s a good thing. But these are small. These are small efforts to try to hold the government to account.
AMY GOODMAN : So, let’s talk about the devastation in the Philippines from the war on drugs. Rappler has helped expose Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte’s deadly war on drugs, including in a video series titled Impunity . This video was titled “Alias Heart.” Heart de Chavez was allegedly murdered by the Philippine National Police January 10, 2017. This clip includes police officer Captain Edwin Fuggan [ sic ], Heart’s sister Arriane and Heart’s mother Elena.
ELENA DE CHAVEZ : [translated] I held her against my chest. That was why my clothes were covered in blood. When I saw her, there was a hole in her face, here.
ARRIANE DE CHAVEZ : [translated] Somebody there said that before Heart was brought into the house where she was shot, they kicked her first. They broke her arm.
ELENA DE CHAVEZ : [translated] That wasn’t just it. They shot my daughter four times.
ARRIANE DE CHAVEZ : [translated] When you’re a rich person, you’re treated like a VIP , but when you’re a poor person, the treatment is RIP .
ELENA DE CHAVEZ : [translated] I know it was the cops who killed her.
CHIEF DANTE NOVICIO : There is no evidence the police did the killing, because the alleged suspects were wearing bonnets, so it’s hard. It’s hard to say.
ARRIANE DE CHAVEZ : [translated] I can identify those who killed my sister as cops.
CHIEF DANTE NOVICIO : The police do not go into homes to kill people. We do have police operations when police do end up killing, so they’ve developed a mindset that it’s the police who killed.
INTERVIEWER : [translated] Do you have plans to file a case?
ELENA DE CHAVEZ : [translated] How can I file a case? Who will I file against? Even if I wanted to, who will I file a case against? Duterte? That he ordered the killings?
AMY GOODMAN : That piece from the Rappler Impunity series. What has happened in that case, the killing in 2017?
MARIA RESSA : Everything is open. You know, there are so many mothers who have lost children. One case had a 5-year-old killed. And there is no sense of justice. And I think that’s what we’re trying to go back to. When the state begins to act like a criminal, when there is no accountability, when people are dying at this rate, there’s something fundamentally wrong. And part of what we’re also trying to remind Filipinos is that we shouldn’t accept this. This shouldn’t become normal.
AMY GOODMAN : So, you’re heading back to the Philippines tonight. Are you afraid?
MARIA RESSA : I think I’m trying to be prepared. You know, when I come out and when I landed in New York, it’s like I don’t realize how heavy the air has become, and when I get here, it’s like—you know, I take a deep breath: “The air is clean! Oh my god! This is what freedom feels like!”
AMY GOODMAN : Well, not quite.
MARIA RESSA : Well, literally, yes, but compared to… And then, now that I’m getting ready—you know, last night, I just started getting mentally prepared. I’m looking forward to seeing my team, who’s doing good work. We’re in the last few weeks of a critical election. If we lose an independent Senate, we could lose our democracy. There is a lot at stake in these elections. And I’m not so sure Filipinos are aware of that, right? So, I’m getting ready. I am energized. We’re going back to battle.
AMY GOODMAN : This is from The New York Times , talking about the elections that are happening on May 13th. “President [Rodrigo] Duterte has publicly released a new list of people [that] he claims are 'narcopoliticians,'”—
MARIA RESSA : Yeah.
AMY GOODMAN : —”vowing his remaining three years in office will be the bloodiest yet in his war on drugs. The list … [including] the names of 46 officials—33 mayors, eight deputy mayors, one ex-mayor, a provincial board member and three members of Congress. In the past, many of those who were listed ended up dead at the hands of police[men] or vigilantes.”
MARIA RESSA : That’s what we’re fighting. Who vets this list? You know, how do you get on this list, especially the first list that we saw? There were dead people already on the list, right? There were vendetta—people who get on there because the people who had power to put them on could. This is extrajudicial, and in the same way that journalists were listed without evidence. We need to demand evidence. We need to hold the executive to account for this. And having said that, what’s the point of this, right? It’s to control power. It sows fear. It makes people afraid to ask and to speak; otherwise, they could be included.
AMY GOODMAN : So, you’ve been arrested twice, jailed once. How much have you had to pay in bond or bail?
MARIA RESSA : Rappler has had to pay more than the entire Marcos family.
AMY GOODMAN : Now, Marcos, the former dictator.
MARIA RESSA : The former dictator.
AMY GOODMAN : And Imelda Marcos, of course, still alive.
MARIA RESSA : Imelda Marcos, who’s been convicted, right? They are convicted. And yet, here we are.
AMY GOODMAN : And she’s out on bail.
MARIA RESSA : She’s never been arrested. And—
AMY GOODMAN : But she’s had to pay something.
MARIA RESSA : Like a fraction of what I’ve had to pay.
AMY GOODMAN : And tell us what she’s been convicted of.
MARIA RESSA : The worst. I mean, the family has siphoned. She has a slew of cases in four different countries, siphoning money away from—
AMY GOODMAN : About how much?
MARIA RESSA : The big number that was thrown at the Marcoses at the very beginning is $10 billion. That is huge.
AMY GOODMAN : And you’ve had to pay more than Imelda Marcos.
MARIA RESSA : I’m very special. And this is why this special treatment, this weaponization of the law—you know, I appeal to the Filipino—the men and women in the judiciary. You have to fight this individual battle for integrity, because we need to maintain the spirit of our constitution. We cannot give it up without a fight.
AMY GOODMAN : Maria Ressa, you go back and forth between the United States and the Philippines. Can you talk about a comparison between Presidents Duterte and Trump?
MARIA RESSA : I think that, you know, the Philippines is a cautionary tale for the United States. What shocked me is how fast things can change. And I think Americans need to be aware that the things that you think have been there for a very long time, it can turn on a dime. And in within six months in the Philippines, all of a sudden it’s OK to kill. If you look at Cambridge Analytica, that scandal, the most number of compromised accounts are in the United States. The country with the second most number of compromised accounts is the Philippines. You can do a lot with the technology that is there. And if your leader is pushing top down, society can transform. Your institutions are still pushing back. But the same thing that I tell Filipinos: Now is the time to fight for your rights. If you do not fight for these rights, they can be taken away, and it can happen quickly.
AMY GOODMAN : May 13th is the elections. And talk about what’s at stake.
MARIA RESSA : There’s a lot at stake for the Philippines in the May 13th elections, because what stopped a change of government in the Philippines has been an independent Senate. The House bill actually already pushed forward and approved a new constitution.
AMY GOODMAN : You have two bodies in the Legislature, like ours.
MARIA RESSA : We’re very much like the United States. Our constitution is patterned after the U.S. Constitution. We have a bill of rights very similar to the U.S. Bill of Rights. We have a House of Representatives and a Senate. The House of Representatives already passed a new constitution, a draft. It didn’t go through the Senate. It was dead on arrival, right?
AMY GOODMAN : And that’s one that would support Duterte’s changes.
MARIA RESSA : Well, this was before. After May 13th, all of the surveys are showing that administration candidates could win the new Senate. And if that happens, it will be only a matter of time before we get a new constitution. It will be parliamentary. It will most likely be a federalist form of government. But forget the facade. The substance of it will fundamentally transform the democracy that we have, take away a lot of the bill of rights, put a lot of power in the hands of President Duterte to appoint a transitional committee. We will no longer be a democracy. Our justice system will be completely transformed. So, this—there’s a lot at stake.
AMY GOODMAN : In what way?
MARIA RESSA : If you’re Filipino, you’ve got to ensure that we retain an independent Senate. There must be checks and balances, regardless of how tiny it is.
AMY GOODMAN : Could the term of Duterte be extended?
MARIA RESSA : If the constitution is changed, everything can happen.
AMY GOODMAN : How long does he have now?
MARIA RESSA : Right now a Philippine president has a 6-year term and can only have one 6-year term. He’s halfway through his term. But if the constitution is changed, you know, all bets are off.
AMY GOODMAN : And when President Trump talks about fake media, when President Trump talks about the media as the enemy of the people, what are your thoughts?
MARIA RESSA : The same things. I mean, they’re the same type of leader—and this is what I said in the toast at Time 100—you know, even though they’re on near opposite sides of the world.
AMY GOODMAN : So, wait, let’s talk about this toast.
MARIA RESSA : Yeah.
AMY GOODMAN : You were just awarded as one of 100—Time 100 most influential people in the world of 2019. You were one of five people chosen to give a toast. Among those in the audience was Jared Kushner—
MARIA RESSA : Jared Kushner, yes.
AMY GOODMAN : —the son-in-law and senior adviser to President Trump.
MARIA RESSA : Yes. And in the toast, I talked about how my sister and I, both born in the Philippines, made two different choices. She chose to make her home here in New York. And then I chose the Philippines. I chose Manila as my home, for better or worse, you know? And I talked about how, despite that, our leaders are identical in style—populist, authoritarian tendencies, sexist at best and misogynistic at worst—and how this is transforming not just the way governance works, but the very values that are the foundation of what our societies are made of, right? The values and the principles, I think that’s the part that we keep forgetting. This will have an impact on the next generation.
AMY GOODMAN : Could you see Jared Kushner as you were speaking?
MARIA RESSA : I couldn’t. But Brian Stelter actually tweeted about it while while it was happening. I didn’t think about, you know—frankly, I’m just calling a spade a spade. You can see it in his—Jared Kushner can see that in President Trump’s words and his actions.
AMY GOODMAN : And what you’re saying to the American people about the moves that have to be made, you’re making me think about Yale historian Timothy Snyder’s book, On Tyranny: Twenty Lessons from the Twentieth Century .
MARIA RESSA : On Tyranny , correct, right.
AMY GOODMAN : About shoring up institutions, responding very quickly, because things descend rapidly.
MARIA RESSA : You cannot be apathetic. You cannot think someone else will do it. Every one of us who cares about democracy, who cares about safeguarding our rights, jump in now, because the battle is now. You will see a quick erosion if you hold back. This is a collective responsibility. And this is the generation that will either win it or lose it.
AMY GOODMAN : What kind of resistance is there on the ground in the Philippines? What kind of pushback is there?
MARIA RESSA : Not much. It’s fragmented. In the Philippines, part of the problem is this—the information operations on social media is effective. We have a popular president, in the 80 percent approval ratings, compared to President Trump’s 30-plus, right? So, it’s—
AMY GOODMAN : Duterte.
MARIA RESSA : Duterte’s approval ratings are high. And again, I don’t know whether that’s reality or not—right?—because the astroturfing on Facebook works. And then the second one is, when you do these statistical surveys, they’re done in their homes, with the addresses on record. If you know that and you live in an area where law and order is weak or where martial law has been declared, would you really say you’re not for President Duterte? I mean, you know, so that’s why these elections are important.
Fear is a factor. You’ve seen that. You’ve talked—we’ve talked about the list, not just of people to be killed in the drug war, but journalists who are speaking up.
AMY GOODMAN : The “matrix.”
MARIA RESSA : The “matrix.” It’s another list, right? It’s a list of people to be targeted. It’s to sow fear. It’s not just about us. In fact, it’s probably not about me. It is about what that does to a society: “If you follow her and you speak out, you are going to be treated like this.” I go back, cautionary tale. This is a tried and tested method of the way President Duterte has ruled Davao City since 1988.
AMY GOODMAN : What in your background has given you this courage? Who are your role models?
MARIA RESSA : I come from different cultures. You know, my family left the Philippines when martial law was declared in the '70s. I grew up in New Jersey, in Toms River, New Jersey. And after I graduated college, I went to Princeton. And this is also ironic, because Imee Marcos, the daughter of Ferdinand Marcos, says that she graduated from Princeton. But Princeton says no. And then, when they congratulated me for the Time 100, then it became a big news in the Philippines again, right? Princeton now has a role in the Philippines. But I guess part of it—it's crazy! I feel like Alice in Wonderland, and the Mad Hatter is in charge. I just have to keep walking through, and I’m going to have faith that on the other side the world will be right-side up.
AMY GOODMAN : Well, I want to thank you so much for being with us. Safe travels back to the Philippines. Maria Ressa, founder, CEO , executive editor of Rappler, acclaimed Philippines news website. Maria Ressa has been arrested twice in recent months by the Philippines government, as Duterte cracks down on the media and all critics. In February, she was detained in one case that’s widely seen as politically motivated, arrested again in late March. We will continue to follow what she faces in the Philippines. She came here to New York to be honored as one of Time 100’s most influential people of 2019 and receive an award from Syracuse University’s journalism school. Each time she comes to the United States, it looks like, at this last point, she’s getting yet another journalism award. We only hope that protects her in the Philippines.

In other campaign news, Biden marked his first day on the campaign trail by attending a $2,800-per-person fundraiser in Philadelphia at the home of Comcast’s top lobbyist, David Cohen. Attendees included Daniel Hilferty, chief executive of Independence Blue Cross, the largest health insurer in the Philadelphia area. Senator Bernie Sanders criticized Biden for holding a fundraiser in the home of a corporate lobbyist. Former Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell, who co-hosted the Biden fundraiser, appeared on CNN this morning, and said the fundraiser attracted the top 1%.
Ed Rendell : “For 90% of the people who attended last night’s fundraiser, they’re contributing against their own financial interest. They will do better with a Republican president, because they’re in the top 1%. So they’ll do better with a Republican president. It will probably cost them money if Joe Biden wins, because I think he’ll bring some sense to the tax cut and he’ll probably raise rates on the top 1%. So, all these people gave money even though it was against their own financial interest.” Topics: 2020 Election The original content of this program is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-No Derivative Works 3.0 United States License .

Former Vice President Joe Biden recently reached out to Anita Hill prior to entering the presidential race. Biden has long been criticized for his handling of Hill’s allegations that now Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas had sexually harassed her in the workplace. Biden was chair of the all-male, all-white Senate Judiciary Committee in 1991 when Hill testified. He forced Hill to discuss in graphic detail Thomas’s sexual comments, and he did not invite other women to testify who could have corroborated Hill’s allegations. Anita Hill told The New York Times she was not satisfied with Biden’s comments during their phone conversation. Hill said, “I cannot be satisfied by simply saying, ’I’m sorry for what happened to you.’ I will be satisfied when I know there is real change and real accountability and real purpose.” Topics: 2020 Election The original content of this program is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-No Derivative Works 3.0 United States License .

In Mozambique, at least five people were killed, and thousands more feared trapped, after the second major cyclone to hit southeastern Africa within weeks roared ashore as a Category 4 storm with winds of over 135 miles per hour. Cyclone Kenneth was the strongest storm ever to make landfall in Mozambique. Officials are warning the death toll is likely to rise, after the storm flattened whole villages, bringing heavy rains that left some towns in northern Mozambique cut off by raging floodwaters. Officials are warning of a looming humanitarian disaster in a region that’s still reeling from Cyclone Idai, which struck in March, leaving nearly 600 dead, while sparking a cholera epidemic and shortages of drinking water and food.

From LBJ to Robert Moses: Robert Caro on Writing About Political Power & Its Impact on the Powerless,www.democracynow.org,mail@democracynow.org (Democracy Now!),04-29-2019,2019,4,https://www.democracynow.org/2019/4/29/from_lbj_to_robert_moses_robert,"Pulitzer Prize-winning author of The Power Broker: Robert Moses and the Fall of New York and The Years of Lyndon Johnson . His most recent best-selling book is titled Working . Links Transcript This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.
AMY GOODMAN : We turn now to one of the nation’s most celebrated writers, the two-time Pulitzer Prize winner Robert Caro. He’s out with a new book titled Working , that gives an inside look at his remarkable research and writing process. And it does appear that Robert Caro is always working.
Forty-five years ago, he published his first book, The Power Broker: Robert Moses and the Fall of New York . Over a seven-year-period, he conducted over 500 interviews for what turned out to be a 1,200-page book looking at how Robert Moses reshaped the nation’s largest city, New York. The Modern Library would later name The Power Broker as one of the top 100 nonfiction books of the 20th century, along with such works as Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring and W.E.B. Du Bois’s The Souls of Black Folk .
And Caro hasn’t stopped working since. For the past 45 years, Robert Caro, with much help from his wife Ina, has been researching the life and times of President Lyndon Baines Johnson, from his childhood in Hill Country, Texas, to his time in the White House. Four volumes have been published so far: The Path to Power , Means of Ascent , Master of the Senate and The Passage of Power . They total more than 3,000 pages. Robert Caro is now writing the fifth volume, looking at Vietnam, the Great Society and President Johnson’s decision not to seek re-election in 1968.
Robert Caro has been described as “the greatest political biographer of our times” and “America’s biographer-in-chief.” But to reduce Caro’s work as simply biographies of great men misses the point. Caro uses both Moses and Johnson to show how political power works. Caro writes that by focusing on Robert Moses, he was able to explore, quote, “the realities of urban political power, power in cities, [power] not just in New York but in all the cities of America in the middle of the twentieth century.” With LBJ , Caro helped expose how national power works in the Senate and the presidency. Robert Caro once told Kurt Vonnegut, quote, “What I’m trying to do, is to show not only how power works but the effect of power on those without power. How political power affects all our lives, every single day in ways we never think about,” he says.
Well, with Democracy Now! co-host Juan González, who today is joining us from Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey, we’re spending the hour with Robert Caro.
Welcome to Democracy Now! It’s great to have you with us, Robert.
ROBERT CARO : Great to be with you.
AMY GOODMAN : I want to go back to 55 years ago. In fact, it would be 55 years ago in July that President Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act of 1964. And go back a few months before that, when Lyndon Baines Johnson, standing next to a blood-spattered Jackie Kennedy, would be sworn in as president. He could have taken on any issue at that point, becoming president. Warned by many in his inner circle, “Don’t do the Civil Rights Act. Don’t lose the South,” he moved forward. Describe for us—set the stage and the place. Talk about LBJ’s decision to go this route.
ROBERT CARO : Four days after the assassination, he has to give an address to the joint session of Congress. He’s not even in the Oval Office yet. He’s still working out of his private home in Washington. Three or four of his speechwriters are sitting around the kitchen table trying to draft a speech. And at some point Johnson comes down wearing a bathrobe and asks them how they’re doing. They say, “Well, the only thing we’re all sure of is don’t make civil rights a priority. If you anger the Southerners who control Congress, they’re going to stop your whole legislative program, like they did Kennedy. It’s a noble cause, but it’s a lost cause. Don’t fight for it.” And Lyndon Johnson says to them, “Well, what the hell is the presidency for then?” And, of course, in his speech, he says, with all the Southern senators sitting in a row in front of him, “Our first priority has to be the passage of the civil rights bill.”
AMY GOODMAN : And talk about the battle that ensued? You particularly focus on Richard Russell, and you pit these two—well, they pitted themselves against each other.
ROBERT CARO : Well, Russell—you know, Johnson convinced the Southern senators—for 20 years before 1964, every vote that he made was on the side of the South. He not only supported every Southern bill and opposed every civil rights bill, but he was a Southern strategist. And Russell took him under his wing. Richard Russell was the most powerful figure in the Senate. He was the head of the mighty Southern Caucus. You have to understand, Amy, in that year—I forget the—I may have the numbers wrong here, but approximately right—of the 16 great standing committees in the Senate, 11 were chaired by Southerners or their allies. They had all the power in the Senate. And Russell raised Lyndon Johnson up to the position of majority leader. It was him who really put Johnson in.
So, I would speak to some of the Southern senators. And I asked one of them—I remember Herman Talmadge, who was actually dying when I finally got to talk to him. He was the senator from Georgia. Finally talked to me, and I’m asking him about this, and I said, “Well, what did Lyndon Johnson convince you should be the relationship between white men and black men? What did he believe?” Talmage said, “Master and servant.” And I said, “So how did he make you believe that?” And Talmadge, who was a sharp man and proud of his sharpness, said, “He talked to me all the time. I thought we were friends. I thought I knew what he really believed.” So I said, “Well, how did you feel when Johnson gave the speech saying our first priority must be the civil rights bill? How did you feel sitting there as he stands there saying this?” Talmadge said—there was this long pause—finally, he says to me, “Sick. I felt sick.”
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Robert Caro, what then changed Johnson and made him such a proponent of the civil rights movement?
ROBERT CARO : Well, I’m not sure that anything changed Johnson. You see, it may be that he believed the same thing all along, but he concealed it for 20 years. You know, why do I think Lyndon Johnson truly believed in civil rights, that it wasn’t a political thing? Because when he was 20 and 21 years old, he went to college; it was a college he called the poor boys’ school. He didn’t have enough money to continue. He had to drop out between his sophomore and junior year and teach school. And he taught in a school in a little town down near the Mexican border in Texas, in what they called “the Mexican school.” I wrote about that. No teacher had ever cared if these kids learned or not. This teacher cared. He was so insistent that they learn English—he thought that was the crucial thing—if, at recess, he heard boys shouting in excitement on the baseball diamond in Spanish, he’d run out and spank them on the spot. Girls, he gave a tongue lashing to.
Now, all this time later, he has concealed this. Now he becomes president. He has the power. You know, we all learn Lord Acton’s axiom, “All power corrupts. Absolute power corrupts absolutely.” I’m not sure that, as a result of my work, I believe that. What I really believe, I believe that power does not always corrupt. Sometimes power cleanses. But what power always does is reveal. When you get enough power so you can do what you want, then people see what you wanted to do all along.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: Well, you know, I was interested in your new book, Working , and obviously some of the stuff that you have in here is a distillation not only of what you learned in the bigger books that you wrote but also the process by which you learned them. You talk about the rise of power of Lyndon Johnson, and you center on this moment in October of 1940, when it appeared to be that Johnson really, as a young member of Congress, begins to gain much more influence and power. And you were fascinated to try to understand what had happened in October of 1940 to suddenly catapult Johnson into a key figure. And you end up discovering this whole connection that he developed to the oil barons of Texas and the funding of the Democratic Party. I’m wondering if you could talk about that?
ROBERT CARO : Yes, it was quite—you see, he’s been in Congress only three years. He’s 32 years old. He has no power. And then, all of a sudden, after the month of October 1940, just before the election, he’s the guy, you see in the files, senior congressmen asking for five minutes of his time. So I said, “What happened during that five months?” At that time I was talking to a notable Washington fixer, a very ebullient wheeler-dealer in Washington for decades, named Tommy the Cork. He used to call me “kid.” So, I said, “What happened in October 1940?” I remember Corcoran said to me, “Money, kid. Money. But you’re never going to be able to write about that, kid.” And I said, “Why not?” He said, “Because Lyndon Johnson never put anything in writing.”
Well, Corcoran was only partly right: Johnson hardly ever put anything in writing. But as I’m going through the papers in the Johnson Library, there are two amazing documents. One is a telegram from Brown & Root, the huge Texas oil contracting and dam building firm for whom Johnson is getting a federal contract, saying to Lyndon Johnson at the beginning of October 1940, “Lyndon, the checks are on the way.” And the money that is being sent to him—unprecedented amounts of money—is for him to distribute to congressmen, because Lyndon Johnson is a genius. He doesn’t have any power, but he realizes there is one thing he has that no other congressman has. He knows two groups of people. He knows the Texas oilmen and contractors who need favors from the federal government, and he needs—and are willing to pay to get it, to give campaign contributions, and he knows the Northeastern, Northern liberal congressmen who need money for their campaigns. He arranges that all this money be given through him, and that creates power.
And there is a list that I found in the Johnson Library that was just remarkable. You know, we wonder: How do you prove that economic power has such an effect on political power, that economic power creates political power sometimes? You see it all in this list. The list is typed by one of Johnson’s secretaries. There are two typed columns. In the left column is the name of the congressman who’s asking for money. In the center column is how much money he’s asking for—small amounts, tiny amounts by our standards: “Lyndon, need $450 for poll watchers,”“Lyndon, $700 will give me a round of last-minute advertising.” But in the left-hand column—left-hand margin, next to the congressman’s name, there is, by each name, something in Johnson’s handwriting. Sometimes he writes—if he’s giving the congressman all the money the guy has asked for, he writes, “OK.” Sometimes, if he’s giving him part of it, he writes, “OK,” and the amount: “OK, 300,”“OK, 500.” But sometimes he writes, “None.” He’s not giving him anything. And sometimes he writes, “None, out.” And I asked his longtime assistant John Connally, “What did it mean when Lyndon Johnson wrote, 'None, out'?” And Connally said to me—I’ll never forget his tone—he said, “That guy was never going to get money from Lyndon Johnson. Lyndon Johnson never forgave, and he never forgot.”
AMY GOODMAN : We’re talking to Robert Caro, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of two books, The Power Broker: Robert Moses and the Fall of New York and The Years of Lyndon Johnson . His most recent best-selling book is titled Working . We’re speaking with Robert Caro for the hour. Stay with us.
[break]
AMY GOODMAN : “We Shall Overcome,” live recording of the late folk legend Pete Seeger singing at Carnegie Hall in 1963. Pete Seeger was born 100 years ago this Friday, May 3rd, 1919. This is Democracy Now! I’m Amy Goodman, with Juan González, who’s joining us from Rutgers University in New Jersey, where he teaches. Our guest for the hour is the Pulitzer Prize-winning author Robert Caro, won the prizes for two books, one on Robert Moses, one on President Johnson, though he’s actually written four on President Johnson and writing a fifth, and now has a new book out called Working . As we listened to that break, Pete Seeger singing “We Shall Overcome,” talk about Lyndon Johnson hearing that song outside the White House.
ROBERT CARO : He’s hearing it. You know, in those days, we had Martin Luther King marching in Selma. The marchers, the pickets, the civil rights movement believed Lyndon Johnson wasn’t fully on their side. They heard his Southern accent. They are singing it on Pennsylvania Avenue outside the White—you can hear it, you know, in the family dining room at the White House. On the night that he goes to Congress to deliver his speech on the Voting Rights Act, as the car turns out of the White House onto Pennsylvania Avenue, the pickets are there, just pressing almost up to the car. And among the things they’re chanting, “Hey, hey, LBJ , just you wait, see what happens in ’68.” And they’re singing “We Shall Overcome.” Johnson is sitting in the back of the car. Three aides are facing him. He doesn’t even look up. He’s turning the pages. But I asked one of the aides, who knew Johnson; I said, “Did he hear them?” He said, “He heard.”
He goes to Congress and gives this speech in which he adopts the key line, the anthem of the civil rights movement, “We shall overcome,” as “our” anthem. He says, “It’s not just Negroes who have to overcome. We have to overcome our prejudice. And we shall overcome.” When Johnson’s car comes back to the White House, I wrote, the pickets were gone.
AMY GOODMAN : I want to turn to an audio recording of a phone call between President Lyndon Johnson and the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. This is from January 15, 1965, as they’re discussing the Voting Rights Act, that would be—Johnson would sign off on.
PRESIDENT LYNDON B. JOHNSON : Then we’ve got to come up with the qualification of voters. That will answer 70% of your problems.
REV . MARTIN LUTHER KING JR.: That’s right.
PRESIDENT LYNDON B. JOHNSON : If you just cleared out everywhere, make it age and read and write. No tests on what Chaucer said or Browning’s poetry or constitutions or memorizing or anything else.
REV . MARTIN LUTHER KING JR.: Yes.
PRESIDENT LYNDON B. JOHNSON : And then you may have to put them in the post office, let the postmaster—that’s a federal employee that I control, who they can say is local, he’s recommended by the congressman, he’s approved by the senator. But if he doesn’t register everybody, I can put a new one in.
REV . MARTIN LUTHER KING JR.: Yes.
PRESIDENT LYNDON B. JOHNSON : And it’s not an outside Washington influence; it’s a local man. But they can just all go to the post office like they buy a stamp. Now, I haven’t thought this through, but that’s—that’s my general feeling. And I’ve talked to the attorney general, and I’ve got them working on it. I don’t want to start off with that, any more than I do with 14-B, because I wouldn’t get anything else.
REV . MARTIN LUTHER KING JR.: Yes, yes, yes.
PRESIDENT LYNDON B. JOHNSON : Do you—and I don’t want to publicize it. But I wanted to—that’s—I wanted you to know the outline of what I had in mind.
REV . MARTIN LUTHER KING JR.: Yes. Well, I remembered you mentioned it to me the other day at the White House. And I have been very diligent about making this statement.
PRESIDENT LYNDON B. JOHNSON : Well, your statement was perfect about the vote’s important, very important. And I think it’s good to talk about that. And I just don’t see how anybody can say that a man can fight in Vietnam but he can’t vote in the post office.
REV . MARTIN LUTHER KING JR.: Yes.
AMY GOODMAN : That was, by the way, that conversation, 1965, was on Dr. King’s birthday at the time. The Voting Rights Act would be signed August 6, 1965. That was Johnson speaking to Dr. Martin Luther King. And I wanted you to comment on their relationship. I once was speaking to Harry Belafonte and said, “When you get on in years and can’t remember your almost daily conversations with Dr. King, you can just apply under the Freedom of Information Act to the FBI to get the transcripts of all the conversations you had.” Robert Kennedy, Johnson’s attorney general, had King wiretapped. Talk about that relationship and what Lyndon Baines Johnson did in signing both the Civil Rights Act and, one year later, the Voting Rights Act.
ROBERT CARO : Well, you know, in the tape you just played, the most significant line was the first two lines that Johnson said. He says, basically, “If you make it easier for Negroes to register, 70% of your problem is solved.” Johnson believed that if they, black people, were given the right to vote, they could take care of a lot themselves. They would start electing their own officials. They would start to change America. So he’s saying to King, “The thing that I’m concentrating on is that you can register just as easy as going into a post office. If we give them the power to vote, they’ll have the power they need.”
You know, Martin Luther King, for a long time, didn’t trust Lyndon Johnson. You know, he didn’t fully—he didn’t believe he fully believed it. When Johnson gives his speech and says, “We shall overcome,” Martin Luther King is down in Selma. He’s listening to it on television in the living room of one of his supporters. And when Johnson says, “And we shall overcome,” they turn around and look at Dr. King, and it’s the only time, they say, they ever saw him cry.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Robert Caro, to go back to your approach to writing and researching, especially in this age when everyone or most of the young people get their information and their news from Twitter and Facebook posts and relatively short articles that they might read online, you actually moved with your wife to Texas to be able to really get into the subject matter of LBJ and his role in history and where he came from. Could you talk about your approach to spending years, often, just writing one book?
ROBERT CARO : Well, on the research—you know, I write pretty fast, although no one believes that. It’s the research that takes the time. The particular thing you’re talking about, moving to the Hill Country, I thought we wouldn’t have to do that. There were already, as I recall, seven biographies published. They all had chapters on his youth that depicted him a certain way. But I’m trying to get a little more detail, just so I can write better couple of chapters myself. And I realize I’m talking—the people in the Hill Country then, it was a land of such loneliness, such poverty, that’s, for me, coming from New York—I said to Ina, “You know, I’m not understanding these people. I’m not understanding their mores. I’m not understanding this country, the Hill Country. And therefore, I’m not understanding Lyndon Johnson, because this is what he came out of and shaped.” So, I said, “We’re going to have to move down there and get to know these people.” Ina, who loves Paris, who writes books on French history herself, said, “Why can’t you do a biography of Napoleon?” But we moved down there.
You know, interestingly, when you talk about why it’s hard to get these people to talk to you, they mistrusted journalists, because when Johnson was president, journalists would come down for three or four days, or maybe even a week, and go back and write these series of articles on what the Hill Country was really like. I’ll tell you what the Hill Country was like. You’d go to interview some person who was alive who knew Lyndon Johnson in high school, now is old. And the directions would be something like: You drive out of Austin for 47 miles; you watch for the cattle guard on your left; you turn left there, and you go on this rutted, unpaved road for like 30 miles; at the end of it is a house with a person with the information you need. You say, “I haven’t passed a house for 30 miles. Who does this person talk to? Does she have any friends?” It’s a different—they’re very wary of strangers. And I wasn’t getting people to talk to me at all. So, as soon as we moved down there, as it happens, as soon as they realized someone had come to stay, in trying to understand them, they would tell me what Lyndon Johnson was really like as a young man, which was very different from anything that had been depicted before.
AMY GOODMAN : You talked about moving there with Ina, your wife.
ROBERT CARO : Yes.
AMY GOODMAN : I wanted to talk about her role—
ROBERT CARO : Sure.
AMY GOODMAN : —which you have extolled, her role in your work. I mean, everything from, when you moved to Hill Country, how she gets to befriend this taciturn woman who was an important source for you, turning up with homemade fig jam she made herself, that opens up the people to speak. But it’s more than the jam. It is the research. It is your trusted fellow researcher, partner in all of this.
ROBERT CARO : Yes. You know, Ina is the only—you know, you look at other biographies, and at the end, in the acknowledgments, they might name three or four, or more, researchers who helped them. I found that there’s only one person besides myself that I’ve ever been able to trust to do my research, and it’s Ina. She is a wonderful researcher. She is also a historian in her own right. You know, in her high school yearbook, says her ambition is to be historical researcher. So, we’ve spent a lot of months and even years of our lives in the Lyndon Johnson Library going through papers.
AMY GOODMAN : We’re going to break for a moment, and then we’re going to come back to continue this discussion and also talk about Robert Moses—
ROBERT CARO : OK.
AMY GOODMAN : —the man who you wrote the book about, The Power Broker . Robert Caro, the twice Pulitzer Prize-winning author of The Power Broker: Robert Moses and the Fall of New York and The Years of Lyndon Johnson ; his most recent best-selling book, Working . This is Democracy Now! Back in a minute.

AMY GOODMAN : “Waist Deep in the Big Muddy,” Pete Seeger singing live on the CBS show The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour in 1967. The song was initially censored from the original broadcast, but then, under enormous pressure, CBS gave in. This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report . We’re spending the hour with the Pulitzer Prize-winning author Robert Caro, who’s out with a new book called Working: Researching, Interviewing, Writing . He won the Pulitzer Prize for the Master of the Senate , about Lyndon Johnson, and, before that, he wrote—he won the prize for The Power Broker: Robert Moses and the Fall of New York . I’m Amy Goodman, with Juan González.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: Well, Robert Caro, I’d like to turn to The Power Broker . I’ve often said over the years to all of my friends in journalism, as well as the students I’ve taught, that you really cannot understand modern urban America without having read The Power Broker . It is really the Moby-Dick of nonfiction writing in America in terms of its epic approach and analysis of how power is wielded and how cities are shaped. Could you talk about how you first decided to write about Robert Moses, perhaps the most powerful unelected official, never elected to any office, in the history—in the modern history of New York, and really had influence in cities across the country?
ROBERT CARO : Well, I was a reporter for Newsday , an investigative reporter. So, I had won a number of minor, really minor—believe me, really minor—journalistic awards. But when you’re young and you win anything, you think you know everything about, and I thought I really understood political power.
Robert Moses wanted to build this bridge from Rye to Oyster Bay. You know, he built these bridges across Long Island Sound. He built the Triborough, the Bronx-Whitestone, the Throgs Neck. Now he wants to build the Rye-Oyster Bay Bridge. Newsday assigns me—I was then, whatever, 24, 25—to look into it. And I discover it’s this really terrible idea. It would have generated so much traffic, the Long Island Expressway would have needed 12 more lanes just to hold the cars, and the piers of this bridge would have had to be so big that they would have caused tidal pollution in Long Island Sound. I went up to Albany. I saw the governor, Nelson Rockefeller, his council, the assembly speaker, the president of the state Senate. Everybody understood this was a terrible idea. I write this story saying the idea is dead. I go on to something else.
About two weeks later—I have a friend in Albany—he calls me, and he says, “Bob, you ought to come back up here. Robert Moses was here yesterday.” So I said, “Oh, I don’t think so. I think I took care of that bridge.” He says, “Well, Robert Moses was up here yesterday. I think you ought to come back.” I come back. I speak to the same people—the governor, the assembly speaker, etc. They all think this is now the greatest idea in the world, and, in fact, the state is going to pay for the initial stages of it.
And I’m driving back to Long Island, and I remember it was 163 miles. And I’m thinking, “You know, you think you know what political power is. You don’t have the faintest idea what it is. You think you’re in a democracy, and political power comes from being elected from the votes that people cast at the ballot box. Here’s a guy who was never been elected to anything, and he had more power than anyone who was, more power than any mayor, more power than any governor, more power than any mayor and governor combined. And he held his power for 44 years. And with hit, he shaped all New York City. And you, Robert Caro, don’t have any idea where this power comes from.” And I also realized, neither does anybody else. That’s when I decided to do The Power Broker .
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: Well, in Working , you talk about also the impact that Moses had on the neighborhoods of the city—
ROBERT CARO : Yeah.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: —and really redesigning many of New York City’s neighborhoods. And you say at one point, “He shaped the city physically not only by what he built but by what he destroyed. To build his expressways, he evicted from their homes 250,000 persons, in the process ripping out the centers of a score of neighborhoods, many of them friendly, vibrant communities that had made the city a home to its people. To build his non-highway public works, he evicted perhaps 250,000 more.” Perhaps half a million people were displaced by the public works of Robert Moses.
ROBERT CARO : Yes.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, of course, many people don’t think about the impact. The destruction of communities in the ’50s and ’60s then led to the rise of crime in the ’70s and ’80s in many of these same neighborhoods.
ROBERT CARO : Well, you know, what you’re talking about is when I decided that my books had to be different than what I thought they would be at the beginning. I came to realize that if I wanted to write about political power the way I wanted to write about it, I would have to show the effect of power not just on those who wield power, but on those on whom it’s wielded, on the powerless; show what government can do for people, for good, but also to people, for not good.
And what I did was I decided to take one mile of the 627 miles of expressways and parkways that Robert Moses built, and show the human cost of that one mile—to do that, I think he had evicted 15,000 people for this one mile; it’s a mile of the Cross Bronx Expressway in a neighborhood called East Tremont—and find the people who had lived there before. Now, before, this was a lower-middle-class community, largely Jewish, but a lot of Irish and German in there. These people were not well-off, but as long as they had a community and neighborhood where they knew had all their friends and neighbors, they had something. I had to find them. Finding them wasn’t easy, because they were scattered all over the four winds. It’s like the tsar issuing an edict in Russia. I think of Anatevka every time I see Fiddler on the Roof , the little town of Anatevka. These people, I found them in Co-op City, in small apartments, in the housing projects, living with their relatives.
And when I would come back and write my interviews, I saw that I was writing one word over and over: “lonely.” I was asking people, “What’s life like now?” And over and over again, they would say, “Lonely.” They had lost their neighborhood, their sense of community. And this is the human cost of what—part of the human cost of what Robert Moses did.
AMY GOODMAN : I wanted to go back to 1953. The TV program Longines Chronoscope interviewed Robert Moses. This is the anchor William Bradford Huie questioning Moses.
WILLIAM BRADFORD HUIE : Of course, to build these roads, you have to move a lot of people’s homes, don’t you, sir?
ROBERT MOSES : Yes, especially in urban communities, in urban and suburban communities. That is one of the big problems.
WILLIAM BRADFORD HUIE : Could you give us any indication of how many homes would have to be moved in building the New York Thruway?
ROBERT MOSES : Well, the New York Thruway is—I would say three-quarters of it is in open territory where there’s no problem. The other one-fourth, I wouldn’t—I wouldn’t know how many.
AMY GOODMAN : So, that’s Robert Moses in 1953. And I was wondering if you could comment on what he’s saying, and also the building of Jones Beach, the access to Jones Beach, what Robert Moses intended—people of color, poor people not being able to get there. Talk about this, Robert Caro.
ROBERT CARO : Well, I’ll talk about the Jones Beach first. You know, Jones Beach is, on the one side, the wonderful side of Robert Moses. He creates the world’s greatest bathing beach in Long Island. There was no place for the masses of New York City, by which was meant, then, white, middle-class people. The automobile age was just flowering. It was the 1920s. And he’s creating Jones Beach. It’s an act of great inspiration.
But he doesn’t want poor people, and, in particular, poor people of color, to use Jones Beach. So what he does—poor people in the 1920s and '30s don't have automobiles, so the only way they can get to Jones Beach is by mass transportation. So he takes care of the railroad side of that very easily: The Long Island Rail Road wants to build a spur to Jones Beach, he just says no. But they can also get out there by bus. He doesn’t want to take any chances of that, so the parkways out there—first, he has legislation passed that buses can’t use the parkways, which are the only way to Jones Beach. But then, as his chief aide once said to me, Amy, he said, “You know, the commissioner”—they called him the commissioner—”the commissioner knew that legislation can always be changed. You can’t change a bridge when it’s up.” So, if you drive out to Jones Beach, you see along the Southern State and the Meadowbrook parkways, the roads to Jones Beach, “clearance”—there are 173 of these bridges—”clearance, 13, nine inches,”“clearance, 10 feet,” because buses needed 14 feet of clearance. So people couldn’t get there in buses.
One of the revelatory moments of my life and Ina’s life, I wanted to see how this affected over the decades. So now I’m doing The Power Broker . It’s not 1930 anymore, when he opened it. It’s now, let’s say, 1970, 40 years later. There’s one big parking lot in Jones Beach with four underpasses that people use to get to the beach. We stood there. I had a pad. And I said whites, Latinos, blacks. And to this day, one of the moments that shaped my career as a biographer was the rage, really, that kept building in me as you had all these things for the white people, the number, hardly any for the Latinos and even less for the blacks. You said, this is what public works, public policy does to the powerless, to poor people, and how long the effect of it lasts.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Robert Caro, you mentioned that many people called him the commissioner.
ROBERT CARO : Yes.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: I want to get back to this issue of how he was able to effect so much dramatic change in New York City through basically the skillful use of what’s known as a public authority to circumvent the elected bodies of government. And he was basically the chair or the sole member of so many little-known public authorities. How he wielded that power, if you could talk about that?
ROBERT CARO : Yes. You know, Robert Moses was a political genius. As I said, looking into him, I realized how little I knew about how political power worked, how he knew everything. He thinks he’s going to get elected to something. He runs for governor of New York state, and people don’t like him, and he loses by what I think is still the largest majority anyone ever lost by a state election in New York. He thinks he’s going to be mayor of New York. He’s not going to be mayor of New York. He realizes he has to get power to build these great public works, these huge public works, somewhere.
He takes a yellow legal pad and goes into a little room next to his office and sits there by himself and drafts legislation which basically create public authorities in the modern form. Before that, they were just entities that sold bonds to build a bridge or a tunnel, collected tolls until the bonds were paid off, and went out of existence. He created legislation that said these authorities will never go out of existence. And as long as he is head of the authorities, he’s going to have the power of the authorities. And these authorities, of course—you know, for about 30 years, if you were paying a toll at any bridge or tunnel in New York City, you were basically paying it directly to Robert Moses. He had more money to build things than the city did.
AMY GOODMAN : If you could talk about the building of Lincoln Center, this cultural mecca, and what it destroyed? And talk about the communities of color that lived in that area.
ROBERT CARO : Well, when you look at Lincoln—you know, this is why The Power Broker is a very complicated—was a complicated book to write, because there are these two vividly different sides of Robert Moses. One is this genius that can conceive of huge public works. The other is this absolute disregard to what happens to the human beings who lived there before, and also the shape in which they’re built.
When you look at Lincoln Center today—you said, before, there, it was low-income, but not a slum, but a thriving low-income neighborhood, which was simply wiped out for Lincoln Center. But what got me about Lincoln Center was that part of this Lincoln—the front part of Lincoln Center is wonderful. Go to the back wall of Lincoln Center. That’s the wall that looks out on what’s left of the neighborhood that had been there before, a poor neighborhood. It’s blank. There are almost no entrances to Lincoln Center. It’s turning its back on New York City, on the poor people of New York City.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: Robert Caro, I’d like to ask you, in the little time we have left, about your writing style. I mean, your books are always very vivid and descriptive, but some of your sentences go on for pages. Could you talk about whether you consciously write these amazingly long sentences?
ROBERT CARO : Well, I don’t do that consciously. The answer to your question is a quick one: No. They just seem to—sometimes they seem to come out that way. Some people say I write too many very short sentences. I’d like to think that means I write contrasting sentences.
AMY GOODMAN : And you write longhand, and then you type? I don’t mean into a computer, but into a typewriter?
ROBERT CARO : Yeah, yes. I write my first few drafts in longhand on a legal pad, and then I use a Smith Corona Electra 210.
AMY GOODMAN : Because?
ROBERT CARO : Oh, it’s to slow myself down, Amy. I think I write too fast. I want to make myself think things through. And I find if I write it in hand, it’s a little bit slower, so I think a little bit more.
AMY GOODMAN : You are a testament to the need for journalists at newspapers, when we see staffs being cut, the level of investigation that you need to investigate power and give voice to the powerless. We want to thank you so much for being with us. We will do Part 2 and post it online at democracynow.org. Robert Caro, Pulitzer Prize-winning author. I’m Amy Goodman, with Juan González.

Sri Lanka has banned face coverings in public, following the Easter Sunday attacks that left more than 250 people dead last week. The country’s president, Maithripala Sirisena, said he was using an emergency law to enact the ban Monday, citing public safety to outlaw “all forms of clothing that cover a person’s face and prevents them from being identified.” Muslim leaders are criticizing the move, which is thought to target the niqab and burka worn by some Muslim women. Kenneth Roth, the executive director of Human Rights Watch, tweeted, “No indication that recent Sri Lanka bombers covered their faces but President Sirisena bans face covering. That needless restriction means that Muslim women whose practice leads them to cover up now won’t be able to leave home.” This comes as 15 people, including six children, died Friday in a raid on a suspected hideout of militants connected to the attack. Three men set off explosives as troops attempted to raid the house, killing the children and three women. Thousands in Hong Kong Protest Proposal to Allow Extradition to China for Trial Apr 29, 2019
In Hong Kong, tens of thousands of people marched peacefully Sunday against a proposal that would allow people to be extradited to mainland China for trial—where they would face far fewer protections than afforded under Hong Kong’s policy known as “one country, two systems.” Many of the protesters held umbrellas, recalling the 2014 Umbrella Movement pro-democracy protests. This is Jayson Shing, one of the marchers.
Jayson Shing : “Once this law has been passed, it won’t matter if you are an average person or a foreigner coming through Hong Kong. There will be a real possibility you’ll be taken and sent off to the mainland.” Topics:"
