Trump defends “very fine people” Charlottesville comments.,slate.com,Molly Olmstead,04-26-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/trump-very-fine-people-charlottesville-defense.html,"Ocasio-Cortez Accuses Kellyanne Conway of Trying to “Stoke Suspicion Around My Christianity” In his campaign announcement video Thursday, Joe Biden reminded the viewers of a particularly shocking moment from the Trump presidency. In August 2017, after violence during a rally of white supremacists and neo-Nazis left one counterprotester dead and dozens injured, President Trump defended the marchers during a press conference and argued that there were “some very fine people on both sides .” Biden’s reference put Trump on the defensive, and in a new statement on Friday, the president indicated he doesn’t regret his remarks about the Unite the Right rally, a white supremacist gathering organized to bring together a large number of far-right groups that had risen in prominence after Trump’s election and pegged to the removal of a statue of Robert E. Lee. “If you look at what I said, you will see that that question was answered perfectly,” Trump said. “I was talking about people that went because they felt very strongly about the monument to Robert E. Lee—a great general, whether you like it or not.” Technically, Trump had mentioned Lee—later on, after he had already weathered a backlash for his initial comments. The press conference in which he first drew moral equivalence between anti-racist protesters and avowed white supremacists came on Aug. 12. “We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides,” he said, placing an emphasis on the last three words. He repeated: “ On many sides .” He gave another more diplomatic response the next day, but the president doubled down on the “both-sides” position three days later, tossing aside his more carefully scripted remarks about condemning hatred to blast his critics in a combative exchange with reporters . “You had a group on one side that was bad, and you had a group on the other side that was also very violent,” he said. “And nobody wants to say that. I’ll say it right now. You had a group—you had a group on the other side that came charging in, without a permit, and they were very, very violent.” It was at that point that he wove in his material about Lee:
But not all of those people were neo-Nazis, believe me. Not all of those people were white supremacists, by any stretch. Those people were also there because they wanted to protest the taking down of a statue, Robert E. Lee. If you look at some of the groups and you see—and you’d know it if you were honest reporters, which in many cases you’re not—but many of those people were there to protest the taking down of the statue of Robert E. Lee. So this week it’s Robert E. Lee. I noticed that Stonewall Jackson is coming down. I wonder, is it George Washington next week? And is it Thomas Jefferson the week after? This argument did not reflect the reality of the situation—there were white supremacists shouting “white lives matter” and “Jews will not replace us.” Instead, he attempted to reduce this violent hatred to an issue of statue preservation. The president then uttered a phrase that would become a rallying cry for his critics. “Yes, I think there’s blame on both sides,” he said. “And you had some very bad people in that group, but you also had people that were very fine people, on both sides.” He suggested that some of the white supremacists were there simply to harmlessly protest the removal of “to them, a very, very important statue.” Trump furiously criticized the “alt-left” as being “very, very violent” and “swinging clubs” and demanded to know if the “alt-left” had “any semblance of guilt.” Trump was grasping for a defense, furious about the bipartisan and nearly universal criticism of his earlier statements. As the New York Times put it: “Venting, his face red as he personally executed the defense of his own actions that no one else would, Mr. Trump all but erased any good will he had earned Monday when he named racist groups and called them ‘repugnant to everything we hold dear.’ ” Biden, in his video, held up Charlottesville and Trump’s poor response to the violence that broke out there as representative of why he is seeking the presidency. Some have accused Biden of using the city and the traumatic event as a prop, but others believe that evoking one of the president’s worst moment of the past two and a half years will speak to a certain segment of the electorate. If nothing else, Biden’s video did get Trump talking—and digging that hole ever deeper. Support our journalism

Avengers: Endgame’s female superheroes are mistreated and then united to take a bow.,slate.com,Inkoo Kang,04-26-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/avengers-endgame-female-representation-black-widow.html,"Endgame Is a Love Letter to Robert Downey Jr. From the Marvel Cinematic Universe This post contains spoilers for Avengers: Endgame . Avengers: Endgame takes its fan-service duties seriously. As the culmination of an 11-year, 22-film cycle, this season finale of a film has to resolve countless storylines and character arcs, but it also takes frequent breathers to feature, say, Captain America fighting an earlier version of himself, the Hulk taking selfies with fans, and a wastrel Thor issuing threats through a headset while playing Fortnite with his fellow Ragnarok survivors. And yet there’s one bit of fan service that couldn’t land more gracelessly if it were tossed off the cliff on Vormir. During the final showdown with Thanos for the fate of the universe, Captain Marvel, Valkyrie, Okoye, the Wasp, and several other female characters get in formation, presumably for audiences to rally around Marvel’s commitment to gender equality and women’s representation. Instead, the scene immediately revealed itself as the apotheosis of the studio’s expectation that fans of female superheroes be satisfied with scraps, while courting woke points for its supposed forward thinking. Endgame treats most of its female characters as walking applause lines first and people (or space aliens) second. Let the record speak for itself: Marvel put out 20 movies with male protagonists, many of them brain-meltingly similar to one another, before releasing its first built around a female superbeing. That 2019 movie, Captain Marvel ,was also the first Marvel movie with a female director in co-helmer Anna Boden and only the second with female screenwriters in Boden and Geneva Robertson-Dworet. Maleness isn’t a disqualifier for writing women well, of course, but even the most dynamic female supporting characters in the Marvel canon—such as Thor: Ragnarok ’s Valkyrie and Black Panther ’s Okoye and Shuri—are relegated to secondary arcs and largely pop off the screens because of the charisma of the actresses embodying them. Many of the other Marvel superheroines have been mired in controversies: Black Widow calling herself a “monster” for her inability to conceive children (after a forced sterilization) in Age of Ultron , Mantis being called ugly in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 , the Wasp having to wait the duration of an entire movie before getting to suit up and size down (at which point she was immediately Snaptured). Then there’s the depressing fact that so many female characters primarily exist to scold or discourage , their most notable superpower consisting of constantly looking like they’re wagging their fingers while not physically performing that action. Humor and valor are the currencies of the Marvel movies. Too often, the women are left in arrears. Endgame is no exception. Tony Stark quips, Captain America checks out his own ass, Thor channels the Big Lebowski, and even the Hulk finds the Buddhist bro within. Hawkeye broods, but he’s ultimately rewarded for his quest with the movie’s yawn-inspiring vision of bliss: heterosexual domesticity. Black Widow, in contrast, seems to hit all the female obligations of superhero tales: to be no fun, yearn romantically, then die, arguably so a man can find happiness. In the rare moments when the female heroes who have been afforded a non-sourpuss personality in other movies show up—Captain Marvel, Valkyrie, Okoye, Shuri—they don’t get to show it. Gamora, Scarlet Witch, and the Wasp may not have a sense of humor—a lack that is frankly the most dehumanizing trait a writer can give a character—but at least they’ve got backstories as superpowered beings. The presupposition that we’re supposed to salute fifth-billed characters like Mantis and Pepper Potts just for showing up demonstrates how deep Marvel had to dig to come up with these ostensible triumphs of feminism. Then there’s the ways Endgame fails its two biggest female characters, Black Widow and Nebula, by not bothering to fully develop their emotional journeys. Black Widow’s readiness to give up on life is hardly established, and on Planet Vormir, she’s on the verge of getting back what she’s desired all along—a family—before killing herself. Even more insultingly, the only continuous Avenger who still hasn’t gotten her own movie—though one’s been promised for years and may yet happen —gets a fraction of the mourning that Tony Stark enjoys. Iron Man gets a funeral, with slow pans across the gathered grievers. Black Widow gets a single mention. Her disappearance from the movie couldn’t have been more abrupt if Scarlett Johansson had magically vanished from the set midway through shooting.

But the greater affront might be the Marvel movies’ ongoing treatment of Nebula, whose tale of grisly, lifelong abuse by her father is seldom given the gravity it deserves. We feel Nebula’s physical pain in Endgame , as she’s pried apart once again by Thanos to serve his own agenda. But the Guardians of the Galaxy movies have tended to villainize her for not getting over her brainwashing fast enough, and now Endgame , which finds her rehabilitated, dares not acknowledge the full horror of a woman forced to kill a stunted, not-yet-ready-to-heal version of herself to save her sibling. In fact, Endgame ’s pat appeal to sisterhood, which unites Nebula and Gamora, is symptomatic of its overall treatment of female characters as walking applause lines first and people (or space aliens) second. The fans are ready to clap for their female favorites, but Marvel should try giving them something to cheer for first."
Ukraine Elected a Sitcom Star President. His Show Tells Us What to Expect.,slate.com,Jennifer Wilson,04-26-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/ukraine-president-volodymyr-zelensky-sitcom-servant-of-the-people.html,"Watch Conan O’Brien Get Effortlessly Upstaged by a Dog Who Refuses to Wear a Fake Beard Last year, the production company behind Servant of the People , Kvartal 95, registered a political party by the same name and nominated the show’s lead actor, comedian Volodymyr Zelensky, for the presidency. Political observers largely regarded his candidacy as a publicity stunt, and in truth, Zelensky did much to encourage that point of view. In lieu of participating in debates, he held large rallies that reportedly felt more like comedy shows than campaign events (he also charged an entrance fee). But on April 21, life imitated primetime, and Zelensky walked away with 73 percent of the vote (an even higher margin than his TV character’s win), beating out the incumbent Petro Poroshenko. As Zelensky has no prior political experience and largely avoided discussing policy during his campaign, it’s difficult to predict what his presidency might look like. All we really have to speculate from is his television show. So what can Servant of the People tell us about how Zelensky might govern Ukraine? Perhaps quite a lot, given how eerily Zelensky’s candidacy mirrors Vasyl Holoborodko’s rise to power: Both were heavily reliant on harnessing a potent mix of anti-establishment sentiment, social media prowess, and countrywide desire to play a joke on the powers that be. Much like the viral video that garnered nationwide support for Vasyl’s presidential run, Servant of the People quickly shifted from mere entertainment to a real political sensation. In 2017, Zelensky told the website Cinema Escapist, “I have started receiving more messages from ordinary people that confirm there’s a desire for [someone like Holoborodko] to lead Ukraine through its current realities.” Those current realities are frightening. An ailing economy, widespread government corruption, and continued fighting with pro-Russian separatists have left Ukrainian citizens feeling beleaguered, frustrated, and maybe, it turns out, even a little desperate. Outside observers, particularly in Russia, have tended to paint Ukraine’s political difficulties as insurmountable and the country as endemically dysfunctional, teetering on the verge of becoming a failed state. The appeal of a show like Servant of the People is that it pushes against the idea that there’s anything structurally wrong with Ukraine; the country just needs good, honest people in office, and then everything will be OK. As one of Vasyl’s friends and appointees puts it: “The country is fine. We just have a lot of jackasses.” Servant of the People pushes the idea that “the country is fine. We just have a lot of jackasses.” In the pilot episode, we find Vasyl living with his parents, sister, and niece in a cramped apartment with outdated furnishings and broken appliances. His father drives an unregistered taxi to supplement the paltry government subsidy he receives as a pensioner. Vasyl works as a public school teacher where he collects a salary that—as his father likes to remind him—is less than he’d receive collecting unemployment wages. Vasyl even has to take out a loan to buy a microwave oven. But one day the family gets a knock on the door: The prime minister is there and congratulates Vasyl, now President Holoborodko. The show flashes back to Vasyl’s history classroom. After learning that his students have been pulled out of class to build voting booths for the upcoming election, he rants to a colleague in a profanity-laden tirade about the uselessness of voting: “It’s always the lesser of two assholes, and it’s been this way for 25 years.” It turns out a student is secretly recording Vasyl, who adds, “If I could have one week in office, if such a thing were possible, I would show them! Fuck the motorcades, fuck the perks, fuck the weekend chalets.” The video quickly garners 8 million YouTube views, and a political star is born. Social media was also a major component of Zelensky’s candidacy. Instead of participating in debates or giving interviews, Zelensky communicated almost exclusively with voters via Instagram (he has 4.7 million followers to Poroshenko’s 286,000).

Thanks for signing up! You can manage your newsletter subscriptions at any time. As president, Vasyl starts to make good on his viral rant. We see him become turned off by the opulence of the presidential estate. During a tour of the property, he’s shown an antique chandelier that was recently replated with gold. “Remember the 2008 crisis?” his aide asks him. “This was that.” In just a couple of episodes, a disgusted Vasyl moves back in with his family and calls for sweeping anti-corruption reforms including one requiring government employees to declare their assets. That mirrored a real initiative implemented in 2016 that showed just how much wealth Ukraine’s political elite was amassing (the mayor of Dnipro had a ticket to space on a Virgin Galactic flight) while the country’s average monthly income teetered around $200. On Servant of the People , Vasyl’s reforms predictably attract pushback from political elites who do their best to collect kompromat (Russian for “compromising material”)—a word that has become increasingly well-known in the U.S. thanks to the alleged pee tape. But their operatives come up empty. Vasyl, in the tradition of inspiring TV presidents, is the real deal, an honest, hardworking teacher who can’t be blackmailed or bought. This is the fantasy of Servant of the People —and it’s a popular one, not just in Ukraine. The ratings success of the show attracted attention from studios worldwide. In 2016, Fox bought option rights to make an American version of the show. Production companies in France and Greece swiftly followed suit. The original series was translated and aired in South Korea in 2017, and Netflix purchased streaming rights the same year. The show’s popularity and global appeal should come as no surprise; the idea that real political change can be ushered in by electing the right people without any radical altering of the political structure is a comforting, if silly, thought. And perhaps nowhere is that thought more attractive than in a country like Ukraine, which has seen revolutions and popular uprisings (most recently the 2014 Maidan movement) yield little in the way of actual change. In the pilot episode, Vasyl, shortly after finding out he’s won, turns to his prime minister and says: “It feels like this is a practical joke.” It is uncanny to watch this scene, indeed this entire show, knowing what we know now. Whether or not Zelensky’s candidacy was indeed a practical joke or publicity stunt gone wrong, his election means that, for better or worse, anyone can become president. Either way, it makes for good TV, and it’s a reminder that democracy can be—and maybe is even supposed to be—scary."
The Supreme Court’s Anti-Worker Rulings Are So Routine Now That We Hardly Notice Them. Big Mistake.,slate.com,Sheldon Whitehouse,04-26-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/sheldon-whitehouse-roberts-supreme-court-lamps-plus.html,"Trump: Fox’s Napolitano Asked for Supreme Court Seat, Pardon for His Friend The Supreme Court’s conservative bloc delivered yet another 5–4 decision helping corporate interests this week. You may not have heard about it, as these 5–4 pro-corporate rulings are now issued like clockwork. A distinct pattern has emerged among the court’s “partisan” rulings, where the Roberts Five render a 5–4 decision attracting no support from the more liberal justices. This one comes at the expense of American workers. This latest partisan 5–4 decision—which came in the case of Lamps Plus Inc. v. Varela —used the Federal Arbitration Act, a law governing how parties can resolve disputes through private arbitration proceedings, to deny a defrauded worker a chance at a class action. Again, if you missed it, you’re not alone. Partisan decisions from the Roberts Five choking off the rights of workers and consumers and protecting corporations from accountability have become so boringly predictable that they’re hardly news anymore. The Federal Arbitration Act is a favored weapon of the corporate-friendly Roberts Five. In a series of these partisan 5–4 decisions, the Republicans on the Roberts court have morphed that statute into a get-out-of-accountability-free card for corporations: Rent-a-Center v. Jackson (2010), AT&T v. Concepcion (2011), American Express v. Italian Colors Restaurant (2013), and Epic Systems v. Lewis (2018), to name a few. All made it harder for workers to get their day in court. All went well beyond the original meaning of the act when passed in 1925, which was to “enable merchants of roughly equal bargaining power to enter into binding agreements to arbitrate commercial disputes,” as Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg explained in a 2018 dissent in Epic Systems . These same arbitration cases often also display the Roberts Five’s fierce hostility—in both judicial and arbitration settings—to plaintiffs who seek to join their claims in collective or class-action cases. This hostility lets corporate malfeasance resulting in high-volume, low-dollar injuries go unremedied. The court’s hostility lets corporate malfeasance resulting in high-volume, low-dollar injuries go unremedied. Lamps Plus is a textbook example. The plaintiff, Frank Varela, sued his employer, Lamps Plus, after a company data breach led to a fraudulent tax return being filed in his name. Relying on the Roberts Five’s arbitration precedent, Lamps Plus lawyers drove Varela’s claims out of court and into corporate-friendly arbitration. In arbitration, Varela sought to arbitrate his claims for a class of similarly situated workers. The 9 th Circuit agreed, applying the legal doctrine of contra proferentem —a long-settled principle of state contract law that ambiguities in contracts be construed against the party that drafted the contract, particularly where that party has greater bargaining power. “A reasonable—and perhaps the most reasonable—interpretation of [the agreement’s] expansive language is that it authorizes class arbitration,” the 9 th Circuit majority said. Then the Roberts Five went to work. Notwithstanding these state contract law principles (remember federalism?) or the absence of any textual support in the arbitration statute (remember textualism?), the 5–4 Roberts majority held that to construe ambiguities against the drafter of an arbitration agreement (almost always a corporate drafter) would contravene what it called the Arbitration Act’s “first principle”—that “arbitration is strictly a matter of consent, not coercion.” As a matter of fact, this employer had drafted the arbitration agreement (ambiguities and all) and had forced Varela to sign it as a condition of his employment. Some consent. (The Roberts Five have a tendency to invent facts in cases to suit their desired outcome— Citizens United and Shelby County being notable examples.) Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in dissent pointed out how “treacherously” the court has strayed from the principle that arbitration is a matter of consent: “Shut from the Court’s sight is the ‘Hobson’s choice’ employees face: ‘accept arbitration on their employer’s terms or give up their jobs.’ ” Once again, the corporate interest won, 5–4. There is an established pattern of bias toward the corporate elite, inconsistent with Roberts’ famous assertion from his confirmation hearing that the justices are just “calling balls and strikes.” In partnership with the American Constitution Society, I just published a review of Chief Justice John Roberts’ tenure through 2018 describing this pattern. Republican appointees have delivered for corporate or conservative interests in 73 partisan, 5–4 decisions during the Roberts era, with big Republican donor interests winning 73 out of 73 decisions. More tellingly, the Roberts Five often trample purportedly conservative judicial principles—respect for states’ rights, textualism, judicial restraint, stare decisis , even originalism—when those principles stand in the way of an outcome they want. In nearly 55 percent of those 73 decisions, one or more of those traditionally conservative judicial principles was ignored. Driving consumers and employees into forced arbitration takes away their constitutional right to a jury trial and spares mighty corporate defendants the embarrassment of testifying under oath, divulging corporate documents through discovery, or being treated equally with an injured person. Closing off class actions—the only economically feasible path to litigate high-volume, low-dollar fraud—creates a safe harbor for this form of corporate misbehavior. Many of the 73 Roberts Five decisions serve to protect corporations from these consequences. Equality before the law is a fundamental tenet of our democracy. Courts and juries have a constitutional role in checking the power of wealthy elites who can push ordinary people around, and who are often not checked by legislatures and executive officials. While the chief justice has recently been inclined toward grand public gestures defending his court’s impartiality , the unmistakable pattern of partisan 5–4 decision leads to an inescapable conclusion: that the Roberts Five are pursuing political outcomes, and are willing to violate basic principles of American governance to execute the right-wing, corporate Republican game plan. Lamps Plus is another case in point. Support our journalism

"Texas retracts claim of mass voter fraud touted by Trump, halts planned purge.",slate.com,admin,04-26-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/texas-retracts-voter-fraud-claim-stops-purge.html/,"The Press Didn’t Just Report Accurately on Trump-Russia Corruption. It Prevented the Corruption From Being Worse. On Jan. 25, Texas Secretary of State David Whitley issued a shocking advisory alleging that 95,000 noncitizens were on the state’s voter rolls, 58,000 of whom had cast at least one ballot. Whitley, a Republican, directed county registrars to commence an immediate purge of these noncitizens using lists he would provide. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, also a Republican, promptly tweeted a “VOTER FRAUD ALERT” summarizing Whitley’s findings, and President Donald Trump repeated Whitley’s claims two days later. By that point, counties had already begun notifying targeted voters that they would be purged from the rolls. On Friday, Whitley quietly promised to rescind his January advisory and halt Texas’ voter purge as part of a settlement with multiple voting rights groups. The factual basis of Paxton and Trump’s tweets has been not just undermined, but fully revoked. Friday’s settlement is a good reminder to be incredibly skeptical of government officials who make eye-popping claims of voter fraud and whose partisan interests are at stake. Over and over and over again, these claims are later proved to be extremely dubious—if not outright false. Whitley compiled his purge list by using Department of Public Safety records to identify individuals who presented documents indicating that they were noncitizens when they obtained or renewed a driver’s license. It cross-referenced that list with the voter rolls, and voilà , found 95,000 names that appeared on both. What Whitley did not consider is the fact that more than 50,000 Texans are naturalized each year—and when they gain citizenship, they do not have to inform the Department of Public Safety. Thus, it’s overwhelmingly likely that a huge number of people Whitley flagged have become U.S. citizens and are lawful voters. As I explained in February: “Driver’s licenses issued to non-citizens are valid for six years, and over the last six years, nearly 350,000 Texas adults have been naturalized. If even one-third of those adults registered to vote, they could easily account for the total number of ‘non-citizen’ voter registrants on Whitley’s list.” So Whitley’s list didn’t really target noncitizens; it targeted naturalized citizens, which happens to be unconstitutional. In response, a coalition of voting rights groups—including Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund, the League of United Latin American Citizens, the American Civil Liberties Union, Dēmos, the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, and the Texas Civil Rights Project—filed lawsuits. A federal judge blocked the purge in late February, describing it as “ham-handed,” “a solution looking for a problem,” and an effort “to intimidate the least powerful among us.” Seeing the writing on the wall, Whitley chose to settle the cases rather than suffer a protracted court battle over his indefensible purge. Under the terms of Friday’s settlement, Whitley must retract his January advisory and ask counties to stop purging voters on the basis of the lists he sent. Instead, Texas will undertake a narrow and restrained approach, using much more detailed, precise criteria and up-to-date information to maintain its voter rolls. Naturalized citizens will not be targeted, and voters suspected of lacking citizenship will have a real opportunity to prove they’ve been misidentified. The state will train county registrars to ensure that they do not purge voters on the basis of incomplete or suspect data. After the Texas purge began, I noted that Whitley had taken a page from the Kris Kobach playbook, tossing out a wildly inflated claim of noncitizen voting, then used the ensuing panic to justify mass disenfranchisement. But that tactic does not necessarily work when voting rights advocates are prepared to pummel the state with lawsuits that uncover the lies and duplicity used to concoct the state’s initial claim (or when the initial claim is so easily proven to be bogus). The Friday settlement ending Texas’ planned purge is an object lesson in the vital role that swift, smart lawyering can play in safeguarding the franchise. If the state hadn’t faced an immediate hail of lawsuits, it may well have gotten away with its lawless assault on suffrage.

The best gift you can give a teacher is a thank-you letter.,slate.com,Matthew Dicks,04-27-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/human-interest/2019/04/best-teacher-gift-costs-nothing-thank-you-cards.html,"Teacher Appreciation Week snuck up on you? Slate’s Ask a Teacher columnists dish on gifts teachers actually want . Carrie Bauer explains why you should never look to Pinterest for teacher gift inspiration . It’s the last day of fourth grade. Kids are so loud and excited that it feels like summer vacation has started one day early. Except the classroom also looks like Christmas, at least to me. My classmates are filing into the room carrying boxes of every size and shape, wrapped in colorful paper and ribbons—gifts for our teacher, Mrs. Lavern. I don’t have a wrapped gift for Mrs. Lavern. I like her as much as everyone else, but my parents have never had the money to purchase gifts for my teachers. I wear my cousin Russell’s hand-me-down clothing—every item too long and too wide—and I raise my hand every morning when Mrs. Lavern asks who is getting a free hot lunch. Giving Mrs. Lavern a box of chocolates is simply not my parents’ priority. And I get it. Still, I feel small and stupid every time my classmates bring in gifts and all I have to offer is a homemade card. I can barely muster the courage to hand it to her when the time comes. Thirty years later, standing before my own class of two dozen fifth graders, I cherish these personal cards from students and parents more than anything purchased from a store, and I’m sure Mrs. Lavern felt similarly. This is why when I’m asked, as I often am, what parents should give their children’s teachers, I always say the same thing: a heartfelt letter. This isn’t just because my family couldn’t afford presents, though that certainly shaped my point of view. It’s also because, as a teacher, I’ve seen how valuable a truly thoughtful note can be. I know that many parents are looking for a quick token to express their appreciation , and as a busy parent myself, I understand that perspective. And those gifts are certainly appreciated. But a sincere thank-you note can have a deeper impact than you might think. Teachers whom administrators trust are able to deviate from the curriculum and work more creatively. They are able to take more risks and teach outside the box. Teachers exist in an odd bubble. A student might say “thank you” at the end of the day or offer us a hug after we help them tie their shoes. They may even leave a note on our desk, like the one I recently received from one of my fifth graders that said, “You make me mad in a good way.” But for the most part, we work hard every day for students who don’t always have the words, inclination, or awareness to express their appreciation. We spend thousands of hours with these little people, struggling to teach them to read and calculate and write. We relentlessly encourage them to make good decisions and treat others with kindness. We fall in love with our students, but in June they exit our classrooms. They may cherish the memories of our time together, but we often never hear about the difference we’ve made in their lives. As you’ve no doubt heard, teaching is often described as “thankless work.” In fact, most of what we hear are questions, concerns, and complaints from parents. Parents wonder if their child has friends, is reading at grade level, or is behaving in the cafeteria. Does Charlie need math support? Shouldn’t Elizabeth be in the gifted program? These are perfectly legitimate questions, and I love discussing my students with their parents, who are, and should be, their children’s fiercest advocates. But many of those same parents are also watching their children grow over the course of the year. They know if their child’s teacher has celebrated their child’s successes or focused only on her struggles. They can tell you with perfect accuracy if a teacher has taken a special interest in their child or if their child has seemingly fallen between the cracks. If your child’s teacher has made a real impact on your child, take a moment during Teacher Appreciation Week to let that teacher know how much her dedication and effort has meant to you. In fact, take it one step further. Rather than simply sending a thank-you letter to your child’s teacher, forward it to that teacher’s superintendent and principal too, or even better, write directly to the superintendent and principal and forward a copy to the teacher as well. I know how helpful these letters can be because I once received such a letter. In June of 2001, I had just completed my second year of teaching, and I was hoping to get tenure soon. On the last day of the school year, I found a note in my teacher mailbox, written by the mother of one of my students. It was addressed to the superintendent of schools, and I could see from the envelope that a copy had also been sent to my principal. I expected the worst—a note addressed to the superintendent is never good—but in fact, the mother had written to express her appreciation for me: “I am pleased to write to you to sing the praises of one of your elementary school teachers, Matthew Dicks,” it began. She told the superintendent that I am tough and that I “challenged the students effectively.” She said that her daughter had developed a deep love for reading, writing poetry, solving math problems, and “even Shakespeare!” After that note, I had no trouble getting rehired for the next year. While a principal conducts formal observations of a teacher and spends time in the classroom throughout the year, a teacher teaches for more than 1,000 hours per year. An administrator might be lucky to see three or four of those hours. Superintendents almost never enter a teacher’s classroom, and even if they stop by for a visit, they don’t get a measure of a teacher’s skill and dedication. That parent’s insight into my teaching meant everything. Teachers held in high esteem can become team leaders, which is often the first step toward an administrative position, and these positions are often accompanied by a bump in pay. A solid reputation makes it easier to facilitate or avoid a grade-level change or transfer to another school. It may also help a teacher to counteract the words of a parent who has lodged a complaint. If parents are clearly happy with a teacher’s performance, the lone complaint can appear as more of an outlier than the beginning of a pattern to an administrator. Teachers whom administrators trust are able to deviate from the curriculum and work more creatively. They are able to take more risks and teach outside the box, like teaching Shakespeare to third graders. And for a teacher hoping to earn tenure, a letter like the one I received can serve as ammunition when a principal argues in favor of that teacher’s tenure to the powers that be. Save yourself some money on Starbucks gift cards this year. Instead, sit down and spend an hour writing something meaningful and impactful about your child’s teacher. Then send it to the principal and even the superintendent. It’s the least-expensive and most-appreciated gift you may ever give. "

It is currently very difficult to get your gender legally changed in the U.K. That might change. In recent months, philosophers have been drafted into making complicated and contentious arguments about what it is to be a man, woman, or any other gender in the service of advancing or blocking the movement for trans rights and recognition. In particular, it has exposed a conflict between trans-rights advocates and a certain wing a feminism, a conflict that has its roots in America in the ’70s. On this episode, we look at the historical origins of this conflict by looking at a single event involving two women in the ’70s, one of whom founded the gender-abolitionist wing of feminism, while the other founded transgender studies. That event, and those ideas, help us to understand the stakes and contentiousness today. This is Part 1 of 2 on the metaphysics of gender and, in particular, the question of what is a woman?

Trump again re-enacts Paris terror attacks using finger guns: “Get over here!

After angering many in France (and around the world) last year when he used finger guns and sound effects to act out the 2015 terrorist attacks on Paris that killed 130 people, he was at it again this week. Speaking to the National Rifle Association convention, Trump once again used the attack as an example of why the United States needs lax gun laws. Last year, that little skit by the president led to complaints both from the French Foreign Ministry and François Hollande, who was French president at the time of the attacks. But that didn’t stop Trump from repeating the same talking point. “Paris, France, they say has the strongest gun laws in the world,” Trump told the crowd in Indianapolis Friday . “If there was one gun being carried by one person on the other side, it very well could have been a whole different result.” Trump then went on to act out the massacre: “Get over here! Boom! Get over here! Boom! And then they left. They were captured later.” The president went on to say that even if a there were a couple of guns in the crowd, the attacks “probably wouldn’t have happened because the cowards would have known there are people in there having guns.” Last year, the spokeswoman for the French foreign ministry issued a statement condemning the president’s remarks: “France expresses its firm disapproval of the comments by President Trump about the attacks of 13 November 2015 in Paris and asks for the memory of the victims to be respected.” Support our journalism

Sam Donaldson: Sarah Sanders deserves “lifetime achievement Oscar for lying.”,slate.com,Daniel Politi,04-27-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/sam-donaldson-sarah-sanders-lifetime-achievement-oscar-lying.html,"A New Obstruction Case Against a Judge Proves William Barr’s DOJ Is Now Just an Arm of President Donald Trump Former ABC News anchor Sam Donaldson slammed White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders for her seeming penchant for lying, saying her efforts at not telling the truth deserve an Oscar . What sets Sanders apart, the former White House correspondent said, is how willing she seems to lie about even the smallest things. “Look, I’ve had the pleasure of working with almost every press secretary beginning with Pierre Salinger in John F. Kennedy’s administration and, except for Ron Ziegler who lied for Richard Nixon, I’ve never seen anything like this with Sarah Sanders,” Donaldson said. And even when it came to Ziegler “there’s a difference” because “Ziegler lied about one thing” and that’s whether Nixon was engaged in a cover-up of Watergate but he was still truthful on other matters. On the other hand, “Sarah Sanders simply lies about everything, taking a cue from her boss. Not just one thing.” President Trump claims he's the most transparent president in history, but the White House has not held a press briefing in a record-breaking number of days""Sarah Sanders simply lies about everything, taking a cue from her boss."" - Former White House correspondent Sam Donaldson pic.twitter.com/HWccmTsbaZ — CNN (@CNN) April 27, 2019 The lies coming out of Sanders’ mouth are so frequent that “I think she’s had an Oscar, a lifetime achievement Oscar for lying,” he added. Donaldson did go on to say though that the real problem was Trump, not his press secretary. “And let’s face it, I don’t know her. I feel a little sorry for her because it’s the boss who does it,” Donaldson said. “She takes the cue from him. Leadership begins at the top. And so it is all the bad things that happen in the administration.” It isn’t just the frequency of the lies, Donaldson went on to say, but also that her lies are far from inconsequential. Other press secretaries may have made up quotes in support of their boss. But Sanders’ lies “are more than innocuous, they fester and they serve not the public’s interest but disinterest in learning the truth.” Donaldson made the comments during a conversation with CNN’s Anderson Cooper about Trump’s claim that he is “ the most transparent president .” Support our journalism

Trump didn’t say a word about the top draft pick, Heisman Trophy winner Kyler Murray, who is black and was selected by the Arizona Cardinals. Instead, he was full of praise for Bosa, who is white and was selected by the San Francisco 49ers. “Congratulations to Nick Bosa on being picked number two in the NFL Draft. You will be a great player for years to come, maybe one of the best,” Trump wrote . “Big Talent!

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 27, 2019 While some were quick to highlight the fact that Trump chose to praise the white player while ignoring the black player , the tweet also came shortly after Bosa expressed contrition for some politically controversial tweets. Specifically, Bosa addressed a since-deleted tweet in which he called Colin Kapernick a “clown.” “I definitely made some insensitive decisions throughout my life,” Bosa said at a news conference Friday .. “I’m just excited to be here with a clean slate. I’m sorry if I hurt anybody. I definitely didn’t intend for that to be the case.” He also denied that the “clown” tweet referred to Kaepernick´s efforts to raise awareness. “It’s not like I’m saying his stance and what he was doing, that’s not what I was calling or talking about at all. It was just a specific thing that happened and me as a young kid a thought popping in my head and boom, decided to tweet it out,” he said . “Bad decision. I respect what he’s done. If it empowers anybody then he’s doing a good thing. So, I apologize for that.” The tweet, which was sent in August 2016 at the height of the controversy of Kaepernick’s refusal to stand for the national anthem, was deleted as part of a broad scrubbing of controversial social media posts. He also deleted other tweets, including some that were supportive of Trump. He also allegedly deleted a tweet that called Beyoncé’s music “complete trash” and another one that allegedly characterized Black Panther as the “worst Marvel movie.” In an interview with ESPN, Bosa said he “had to” delete the tweets because “there is a chance I might end up in San Francisco.” Support our journalism

A law enforcement source tells ABC News the suspect appeared to fire “more than 10 rounds” before leaving, noting it all happened very quickly. “[We were] outside in front of our house and heard about six gunshots, a pause, some yelling and then another six or seven gunshots,” neighbor Chris Folts said. The San Diego County sheriff’s office said on Twitter that a man has been detained in connection with “a shooting incident” that took place at the Chabad of Poway synagogue.

Golden State Warriors vs. Houston Rockets: Is Kevin Durant the best player in the world?,slate.com,Nick Greene,04-27-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/golden-state-warriors-vs-houston-rockets-is-kevin-durant-the-best-player-in-the-world.html,"The Spurs Forgot How Fouling, Time, and Points Work The only knock you can make on Kevin Durant’s 50-point performance against the Los Angeles Clippers is that Golden State needed to play a Game 6 in order for it to happen. The Warriors lost as many home games in this first-round series (two) as they did during their previous two postseason runs combined, and the extra work of Friday’s 129-110 victory took its toll. While Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson both suffered—and played through—ankle injuries, Durant took control of the offense and tested the endurance of the Staples Center’s scorekeeper. Durant scored 38 before halftime, which tied an NBA playoff record for most points in a single half. He was as efficient as he was prolific, and it only took him 26 shots to reach his final tally of 50 points. It was the kind of performance where the numbers themselves make for jaw-dropping highlights, but the actual highlights are worth watching, too. 50 pts | 15-26 FG — ESPN (@espn) April 27, 2019 Seven-footers aren’t supposed to be that nimble, and Durant scored with the ease of a retirement home orderly retrieving a blanket from a moderately high shelf. It looked so effortless that I was relieved to see him out of breath during the halftime interview, if only for the sake of his opponents’ pride. “We tried everything,” Clippers guard Lou Williams said after the game. “Sometimes, you come across special people and it doesn’t matter what you send to them.” Can’t hate on this answer. Good series 😂😂😂 pic.twitter.com/shHHDKzy1Q — Warriors on NBCS (@NBCSWarriors) April 27, 2019 “That was one of the great performances I’ve ever seen in my life, and I’ve seen some good ones,” Warriors head coach Steve Kerr said after the game. Kerr called Durant “ the best player in the world ,” and the forward won’t have to wait long to justify that praise. Golden State’s next series, against the Houston Rockets, starts on Sunday. No team has come closer than the Rockets to toppling the Warriors during the Durant era. They pushed Golden State to a Game 7 in last year’s Western Conference Finals before succumbing to one of the coldest (and oddest) shooting performances in postseason history ( 7-for-44 from beyond the arc ). If you believe luck manifests itself in broad, pendular swings, then Curry and Thompson’s ankle injuries probably look pretty significant. Both players are expected to play in Game 1, but they were clearly hobbled against the Clippers on Friday so expect Durant to be tasked with much of the heavy lifting. For at least the immediate future, Golden State will be his team. Despite winning two consecutive Finals MVP trophies, Durant has been something of an adjunct superstar during his tenure with the Warriors. He’s been the plus-one to their party, and this has helped fuel rumors of his imminent departure during free agency this summer. Some league insiders are treating this as a foregone conclusion , meaning all that’s left to determine is whether or not Durant leaves as a champion. That, like everything else related to the Warriors at the moment, is completely up to him."
Oliver North is out as president of NRA amid bitter leadership battle.,slate.com,Daniel Politi,04-27-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/oliver-north-ousted-president-nra-wayne-lapierre.html,"William Barr Is Cowering at the Prospect of a Proper Cross-Examination The bitter leadership battle that has engulfed the National Rifle Association and recently burst into public view has come out with a clear winner. Oliver North surprised attendees at the group’s annual convention by announcing that he would not serve a second term as president of the organization, as is tradition. Although he doesn’t outright say it, the letter North had someone read on his behalf at the convention makes clear that he was forced out following his efforts to get longtime CEO Wayne LaPierre out of the organization.In the statement, North says he was “informed” that he would no be nominated for reelection after his term ends Monday. “I’ve been on the NRA board for more than two decades,” North said. “It was a great privilege to serve as your president this past year, an honor second to only serving our country as a U.S.Marine in combat.” North went on to say that shortly after he took office in September he was faced with a spate of complaints about how much money the NRA was paying a contractor. North also called for a committee to be set up to review the NRA’s finances. The shocking turn of events at the organization that is embroiled in an intense leadership battle comes a day after it was revealed that LaPierre wrote a letter to the board accusing North of extortion. In the letter, LaPierre said North, the former Marine Corps lieutenant colonel who is best known for the role he played in the Iran-contra affair, had threatened to release “damaging” information about him to the board. “Delivered by a member of our Board on behalf of his employer, the exhortation was simple: resign or there will be destructive allegations made against me and the NRA,” LaPierre wrote in the letter that was first reported by the Wall Street Journal. The leadership dispute also comes at a time when the New York attorney general, Letitia James, has opened an investigation into the group’s tax-exempt status, reports the New York Times . That looming investigation is in part what sparked the confrontation. “The current situation,” North wrote in his statement, means that the organization’s “non-profit status is threatened.” James’ actions were hardly a surprise. Before he relection last year, she had vowed to investigate the NRA’s tax-exempt status, saying in an interview that while the group claimed to be “a charitable organization” it was actually “a terrorist organization.” Support our journalism

Conan O’Brien hired a dog to wear a beard. Big mistake.,slate.com,Matthew Dessem,04-27-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/conan-obrien-dog-wearing-fake-beard-off-script.html,"“We discussed this, and I said no.” TBS Silent film comedian Monty Banks once claimed that his career took off because he didn’t understand English. Hired to play minor roles and do odd jobs at Keystone, the Italian immigrant came to Mack Sennett’s attention when filmmakers started complaining that he wouldn’t take direction; upon looking into the matter, Sennett discovered that Banks was failing to do what he was told, but not out of arrogance. Since he had very little idea what his directors were saying, he took his best guess and improvised, with results that Sennett reportedly found funnier than following instructions would have been. A long career in comedy—cut short when sound film made Banks’ accent an insurmountable obstacle—was born. All of which is to say that the heroic dog in this Conan sketch needs a Mack Sennett to champion his bold and daring comedic vision, because this is a star turn: As originally written, this would have been a mildly amusing sketch about the all-too-often overlooked issue of beard sanitation, with some sort of meta-twist once the dog with a beard arrived. As performed, however, it is a brilliant and hilarious sketch about a dog who refuses to wear a fake beard, then yells at Conan O’Brien for trying to make a dog wear a fake beard in the first place. It’s rare to see a true breakout performance in a late-night sketch, and rarer still to see that performance come from a performer refusing to follow the script—there’s Andy Kaufman on Fridays and not much else—but this is the genuine article. But even when a good boy goes rogue, television is a collaborative medium, and everyone else on Conan deserves credit for immediately switching gears and helping to execute the dog’s vision. Andy Richter and Conan O’Brien both take their cues from the dog’s energy, swallowing their pride and correctly recognizing that they were now in a new, funnier sketch than the one they’d originally planned. And the off-the-cuff decision— probably made by Conan director Billie Bollotino —to shoot a slow push in on the bearded dog’s disapproving stare is the stuff television legends are made of. But it’s the basset hound who deserves the most credit for picking up the bearded dog’s vibe and running with it, and not just because basset hounds are not very good at running with anything . In his initial appearance, before the sketch goes off-leash, the basset hound does more or less what he’s supposed to, looking confused but not unhappy about replacing a bearded man in Conan’s studio audience. After the beard incident, however, he gives Conan an even more withering stare than the bearded dog, complete with an intimidating streamer of drool. This final twist turns what could have been a botched sketch into an unsparing critique of the uneasy bond between man and dog, particularly with regards to men who make dogs wear fake beards on late night television. It’s the greatest achievement in beard-related sketch comedy since “ The Bearded Men of Space Station 11 ,” and we owe it all to the unerring comedic instincts of one very good dog.

Marvel A lot of people all over the world decided to watch Avengers: Endgame on Friday, and they paid a lot of money for the privilege, Variety reports . In fact, in many countries, they paid more money than any person or group of people has ever paid to watch a single movie in a single day. Tony Stark and company earned $156.7 million dollars domestically on Friday, which shatters the previous record for a Friday opening of $119 million, held by Star Wars: The Force Awakens . Avengers: Endgame also broke the record for Thursday previews, taking in $60 million to The Force Awakens ’ $57 million. Internationally, the movie was also no slouch: In China, it earned $107.2 million on its Wednesday debut, the country’s largest single-day box office haul. It also broke the single-day box office records in Argentina, Australia, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Columbia, Egypt, Hong Kong, New Zealand, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, the Philippines, Taiwan, Thailand, Trinidad, the U.K., and Uruguay. What’s more, it set top opening day records in Indonesia, Malaysia, Netherlands, Greece, Portugal, Slovakia, Turkey, and the Ukraine. That’s 28 of the 193 member states in the United Nations, or just under 15%, the greatest international consensus anyone has achieved since we agreed we weren’t going to do anything about climate change . Domestic weekend estimates for the film range from $310 million to $345 million, which will easily break Avengers: Infinity War ’s current record of $257.7 million. It had already broken the international record by Friday, pulling in about $487 million so far. The Fate of the Furious only managed a paltry $443 million. Finally, Avengers: Endgame is playing on more North American theater screens than any film in history, with 4,662 separate screens showing Avengers: Endgame . Those are impressive numbers, but consider this: The maximum potential domestic box office—all 327.2 million people in the United States and another 37.06 million Canadians paying an average price of $9.11 to see the same movie on the same weekend—is just over $3 billion, even if no superfans see the movie twice. That means that for all the shattered records, the latest chapter in the Marvel Cinematic Universe will only make it 11.5 percent of the way to complete cultural hegemony.

White House Correspondents' Dinner: Watch Ron Chernow pine for a more civilized age.,slate.com,Matthew Dessem,04-28-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/white-house-correspondents-dinner-ron-chernow-whcd.html,"Ron Chernow speaking at the White House Correspondents’ Dinner. CSPAN After last year’s White House Correspondents’ Dinner, in which Michelle Wolf drew fire for correctly noting that press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders lied to the press , the White House Correspondents’ Association decided to hire a historian instead of a comedian. Ron Chernow, author of Alexander Hamilton , got tapped primarily to provide less controversy, as he acknowledged:
I confess that I was surprised when I got the invitation to speak here tonight. I mean, I knew they weren’t approaching me as an international sex symbol, right? Then Olivier told me that they wanted to try “boring” at this year’s dinner, and I said, “Oh, I can deliver on that big time . Now you’re talking my language.” For the most part, Chernow succeeded. Here’s his full speech: Since Stephen Colbert’s legendary 2006 WHCD appearance in 2006, the WHCD has occasionally been a venue where people spoke frankly about the government—and world—we’ve built. Chernow’s speech, although it included a few quips about Donald Trump’s intelligence, seemed like it was written on another planet, someplace where authoritarianism could be effectively fought with civility:
Even though it may seem wistful and naïve and a touch quixotic, I would like to keep alive tonight the fading memory of more civilized dealings between chief executives and the news media. Call it a museum of presidential decorum. At this confrontational moment in American politics, we must recall that civility has been an essential lubricant in our democratic culture and that our best presidents have handled the press with wit, grace, charm, candor, and even humor. Chernow is exactly right: That does seem wistful and naïve and a touch quixotic. It doesn’t matter how plush the velvet glove on the iron fist is, and there is no amount of wit, grace, charm, or humor that would make the resurgence of authoritarianism and white supremacy in the United States any better for anyone. Still, candor does matter, and it is true that Donald Trump is a different sort of president. Chernow made this point by tracing the history of presidential relationships with the press, sharing stories about both Roosevelts, Kennedy, and, of all people, Ronald Reagan:
Now, Ronald Reagan was a no less sunny personality and a past master, of course, of media relations. When he became president, he said, “I think that most of the time, the overwhelming majority of reporters do a fine job, and as a former reporter, I know just how tough their job can be.” Nevertheless, Reagan had a sometimes bumpy relationship with the press. Then on March 30, 1981, he was shot and nearly killed outside this very hotel, the Washington Hilton, as he was about to duck into his limousine. A bullet lodged within an inch of his heart. Reagan was scheduled to speak at, yes, the White House Correspondents’ Dinner. And so he telephoned in this line instead. “If I could give you just one little bit of advice: When somebody tells you to get into a car quick, do it.” That was a touch of class that has been sorely missing in our political culture in recent years. It was a subtle reminder that whether Republicans or Democrats, we are all bona fide members of Team U.S.A., and not members of enemy camps. With all due respect to Chernow, what the government of the United States is missing today is not “a touch of class,” or a phone call from the president to the White House Correspondents’ Dinner, and Ronald Reagan’s lawless , inhuman presidency should be a model to no one. It’s pointless to decide who is a bona fide member of “Team U.S.A.” when the planet is boiling and white supremacists are shooting up synagogues , but pretending that the politicians responsible are not “members of enemy camps” to all humanity is voting for table manners over the survival of the species. But Chernow did point to journalists who spoke frankly about how power and money work, including Ida B. Wells , Jacob Riis , Lincoln Steffens , Ida Tarbell , and Upton Sinclair , all of whom are well worth reading and contrasting with Chernow’s palpable wish for a more civilized era. There’s nothing civil about any of this. There never has been. Get Slate Culture in Your Inbox We encountered an issue signing you up. Please try again.

"The Spurs Forgot How Fouling, Time, and Points Work",slate.com,Nick Greene,04-28-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/nuggets-beat-spurs-after-san-antonios-lack-of-foul-play.html,"Ian McEwan Should Read Some Science Fiction If a buzzer-beater is a definitive and thrilling way to end a basketball game, then the Denver Nuggets won Saturday’s Game 7 against the San Antonio Spurs with whatever the opposite of a buzzer-beater is. After Denver took a 90-86 lead on a Jamal Murray teardrop, the Nuggets’ Torrey Craig blocked the Spurs’ DeMar DeRozan at the rim at the other end. Denver center Nikola Jokic grabbed the rebound with a little more than 27 seconds remaining and Denver … just dribbled out most of the shot clock? THE NUGGETS GET THE BUCKET AND BLOCK TO SECURE THE SERIES! 😱 #MileHighBasketball pic.twitter.com/7PK3QC20vU — NBA on TNT (@NBAonTNT) April 28, 2019 San Antonio is always one of the best-coached teams in the NBA with Gregg Popovich at the helm, yet the Spurs failed to foul and extend the game—something any grade-school squad ( and most college teams ) would know to do. Popovich was on the floor yelling at his players , but his instructions were lost in the din of the Pepsi Center. When asked about it after the game, Popovich said, “ Obviously he didn’t hear it cause he didn’t foul .” The “he” Popovich is referring to here is Spurs veteran LaMarcus Aldridge, who was the on-ball defender during that last possession. Though, after 13 years in the league, Aldridge should probably know what to do when his team is down 4 with the clock running down, even without someone yelling “foul!” in his ear. Aldridge was not alone in his aloofness. San Antonio’s failure to foul during the last sequence didn’t get a single mention from the TNT commentating crew. Denver got one last shot up at the buzzer but, with only a few seconds left, San Antonio couldn’t do anything with the rebound. It was a fitting end for a sloppy game, one in which the Spurs shot 22 percent in the first quarter and the Nuggets nearly threw away a 17-point third-quarter lead. If both teams are doing their best to lose, then it’s only fair to sound the buzzer and let everybody go home."

In a pair of tweets after his campaign rally in Wisconsin, Trump said that Napoitano had become “very hostile” toward his administration after he rejected his requests. “Ever since Andrew came to my office to ask that I appoint him to the U.S. Supreme Court, and I said NO, he has been very hostile!

Trump even quoted Napolitano in his tweets several times during his presidency and referred to him as a “ very talented legal mind ” during a joint news conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel.

"Judge Damon Keith, civil rights icon, dies at 96.",slate.com,Mark Joseph Stern,04-28-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/judge-damon-keith-civil-rights-icon-dies.html,"A Police Shooting at Yale Shows How Campus Police Have Fostered a Climate of Fear The United States lost a civil rights icon on Sunday when Judge Damon Keith died at the age of 96. A judicial giant who served on the bench for more than 50 years, Keith adamantly refused to tolerate injustice in any form. His landmark opinions defending the constitutional liberties of unpopular groups provoked ire and, at times, death threats against the judge. But Keith never yielded, facing down opponents as powerful as the president of the United States and as violent as the Ku Klux Klan. He maintained his resolute belief in equality to the very end of his extraordinary career. Keith was born in Detroit on July 4, 1922, a patriotic coincidence he always relished. He served in a segregated Army unit during World War II, an experience that drove home the evils of American racism. “I served my country,” Keith later said , “but when I returned, I still had to ride on the back of the bus, drink from separate water fountains and use separate bathrooms. I thought, is this what I’ve been fighting for? Have I been laying down my life to come back to this world of Jim Crows and racists?” After attending Howard University School of Law, Keith worked closely with the NAACP and eventually served on the Michigan Civil Rights Commission. In 1967, President Lyndon Johnson appointed him to federal district court in Detroit; 10 years later, President Jimmy Carter elevated him to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6 th Circuit. As soon as Keith joined the bench, he faced a series of hugely controversial disputes over civil rights. In 1970, he ordered the desegregation of public schools in Pontiac, Michigan, prompting serious threats against his life. A year later, the KKK firebombed 10 Pontiac school buses. (Keith never considered backing down, explaining : “I don’t scare easily.”) In 1971, he ruled that the city of Hamtramck’s “urban renewal program”—which mostly entailed demolishing black people’s homes—constituted unlawful housing discrimination and ordered the homes rebuilt. That same year, Keith halted the Nixon administration’s warrantless wiretapping program. President Richard Nixon sued Keith in an effort to maintain the practice, but the Supreme Court unanimously sided with Keith, holding that Nixon had violated the Fourth Amendment. These decisions alone would’ve been enough to cement the judge’s legacy . But on the 6 th Circuit, he continued to field contentious disputes over civil rights. In 2002, he wrote the decision for the court in Detroit Free Press v. Ashcroft , a challenge to the Bush administration’s efforts to close off post-9/11 deportation hearings to the public and press. Keith ruled that the First Amendment barred the government from holding secret deportation hearings. It was in this opinion that Keith coined his famous phrase “democracies die behind closed doors.” The passage in which that aphorism appears is worth quoting in full. Explaining that a free press is a vital safeguard of immigrants’ rights, Keith wrote:
Today, the Executive Branch seeks to take this safeguard away from the public by placing its actions beyond public scrutiny. Against non-citizens, it seeks the power to secretly deport [immigrants] … The Executive Branch seeks to uproot people’s lives, outside the public eye, and behind a closed door. Democracies die behind closed doors. The First Amendment, through a free press, protects the people’s right to know that their government acts fairly, lawfully, and accurately in deportation proceedings. When government begins closing doors, it selectively controls information rightfully belonging to the people. Selective information is misinformation. The Framers of the First Amendment … protected the people against secret government. The Bush administration declined to appeal Keith’s decision to the Supreme Court. Even in his mid-90s, Keith never wavered from his staunch defense of the Constitution. In October 2016, at age 94, he wrote an impassioned and historic dissent from a 6 th Circuit decision allowing Ohio to curtail black voters’ access to the ballot. Keith, in protest, included a gallery of “martyr of the struggle for equality” in his opinion. He explained:
The utter brutality of white supremacy in its efforts to disenfranchise persons of color is the foundation for the tragedy that is the majority’s effort to roll back the progress of history. I will not forget. I cannot forget—indeed America cannot forget—the pain, suffering, and sorrow of those who died for equal protection and for this precious right to vote. I add the following publicly available historical statements to humanize the struggle for the right to be equal participants in the democratic process. Later, Keith told me he “wanted to dramatize the racist attitude of the majority.” He made no effort to conceal his disdain for the conservative judges who turned a blind eye to Ohio’s racist assault on the franchise. Today, judges like Keith are in short supply. In just two years, President Donald Trump and Senate Republicans have stacked the judiciary with judges who are overwhelmingly straight, white, and male . These individuals were chosen because of their past work defending the powerful and harming the powerless. Many spent their careers helping to abridge minority voting rights and now refuse to say if Brown v. Board of Education was correctly decided. Some promoted racist conspiracy theories and defended states’ rights to disenfranchise black voters. These judges are anathema to Keith’s enduring vision of constitutional equality. His death is a great loss for the country—and a reminder of what judicial courage looks like at a time when it is in increasingly short supply. Support our journalism

The Milwaukee Bucks’ superstar has the wingspan of a California condor and can get from half court to the hoop with a single dribble . Defending him must be like putting a lightning bolt in a headlock, which why I’m happy I will never have to try. The Boston Celtics don’t have that luxury, but if Game 1 of their second-round playoff series against the Bucks is any indication, they have a pretty sound plan for how to approach him. Boston won 112-90 on Sunday, and they limited Antetokounmpo to just to 22 points on 33 percent shooting. It was a great all-around performance from the Celtics, and their defense on Milwaukee’s MVP candidate is what stood out the most. Boston sent waves of players at Antetokounmpo, but center Al Horford was tasked with the brunt of this work. Horford is an experienced defender, and he stayed between Antetokounmpo and the rim all game. In one second-quarter sequence, Hoford stuffed Antetokounmpo twice, and he spiked the second attempt like he was playing tetherball against a summer camp nemesis.

Attorney General Barr threatens to cancel House testimony on Mueller report amid format dispute.,slate.com,Daniel Politi,04-28-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/attorney-general-william-barr-threatens-cancel-house-testimony-muelle.html,"Trump: Fox’s Napolitano Asked for Supreme Court Seat, Pardon for His Friend Attorney General William Barr has threatened he may not show up to his scheduled testimony before the House Judiciary Committee about special counsel Robert Mueller’s report on Thursday as his office has made it clear to Democrats that he is none too happy with the format of the hearing. CNN was first to report the story, which was later confirmed by several others, citing an unnamed committee source that said Barr wouldn’t go to the hearing unless there was a change in the proposed format. Failing to attend the hearing would mark a huge escalation in tensions between the Trump administration and Democrats , who have requested to see the full, unredacted Mueller report. There are two basic sticking points. First, House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler has proposed that after lawmakers complete their allotted time for questioning there would be an additional 30-minute round for each side of the aisle in which Democratic and Republican counsels could question Barr . “The attorney general agreed to appear before Congress. Therefore, members of Congress should be the ones doing the questioning,” Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said. “He remains happy to engage with members on their questions regarding the Mueller report.” Barr is also reportedly opposed to the idea of moving to a closed session if lawmakers want to discuss parts of special counsel Robert Mueller’s report that were redacted. Nadler was defiant Sunday morning, telling CNN that Barr would not “dictate the format of the Judiciary Committee.” Nadler added that “the witness is not going to tell the committee how to conduct its hearing, period.” Asked what could be the next step if Barr doesn’t agree to testify, Nadler didn’t mince words. “Then we will have to subpoena him, and we will have to use whatever means we can to enforce the subpoena,” he said. Barr is scheduled to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday and the House committee on Thursday. Seeing as though the hearing is still a few days away, the two sides could still come up with some sort of compromise that would allow it to move forward as scheduled. Support our journalism

Replays of Harden’s miss showed that Draymond Green encroached slightly into his landing area (while Harden kicked out his legs while airborne). This alone would not have been too controversial, but a Warriors player sliding under a Rockets jump-shooter had been a theme for much of the first half. The officials didn’t call fouls then, either. The NBA rulebook states that “ [d]efenders may not move into the landing area of an airborne shooter. ” Golden State guard Klay Thompson did this with enough frequency during the first half that ABC play-by-play announcer Mike Breen said that he was fortunate to not have four fouls called against him (Thompson had one foul at the time). During Klay Thompson's defensive matchups against James Harden, it appeared multiple fouls should've been called after he landed underneath Harden's feet during his shot attempts. https://t.co/zSZr2Ug8Dj — Twitter Moments (@TwitterMoments) April 28, 2019 The commentating crew brought in rules analyst Steve Javie for his perspective, and the retired NBA official said that he believed the close-outs in question were indeed illegal. Later in the game, Paul drained a 3-pointer as the Warriors’ Shaun Livingston crowded his landing space. The officials held their whistles, and Paul earned the first of his two technical fouls for protesting the non-call. That is tough, CP3 😤 pic.twitter.com/QPtdcPwU4K — NBA on ESPN (@ESPNNBA) April 28, 2019 After the game, Rockets head coach Mike D’Antoni said that the officials told him at halftime that they had missed those calls on the Warriors’ close-outs. Coach D’Antoni: “They (Referees) came at halftime and said they missed it. That’s what they told me. They missed four of them. That’s 12 foul shots.” #Rockets pic.twitter.com/DcPX5yBPLT — Alykhan Bijani (@Rockets_Insider) April 28, 2019 The Warriors should be familiar with this type of play, as their former center Zaza Pachulia helped make it infamous. In the 2017 postseason, Pachulia injured then–Spurs star Kawhi Leonard when he slid his feet under Leonard during a 3-point attempt . The ensuing ankle sprain knocked Leonard out of the playoffs, and the league updated the rulebook in the offseason to address the issue. Dubbed “the Zaza rule,” it lets officials call a flagrant or technical foul if they deem a player’s close-out to be intentional or unnaturally reckless. “ It’s 100 percent for the safety of the players ,” Joe Borgia, NBA senior vice president of replay and referee operations, said at the time. No one was injured during any close-outs on Sunday, but Houston’s hopes of winning the series were certainly dinged. As the league prepares its officiating report for the game, all Rockets general manager Daryl Morey can do is shrug. Been working on things since 2006 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ https://t.co/DchJM8vl2l"

HBO There are two versions of Last Week Tonight . First, there’s the Last Week Tonight that exists online, where the conversation is driven by the segments released on YouTube. These are almost always the show’s trademark longform muckraking pieces on a single issue of public concern, from corporate tax rates to the NRA’s television network . Then there’s the much stranger version of Last Week Tonight that airs on HBO, where the longform segments are preceded by shorter, weirder bits, like the legendary montages of C-SPAN anchor Steve Scully being patient with people who call into his show. Last week, Oliver’s main story was about the Mueller Report, an informative and funny 15-minute rundown of the latest developments in what Oliver calls “Stupid Watergate.” But there’s no Last Week Tonight this week, presumably because HBO needs the time to kill off as many Game of Thrones characters as possible, so the network posted a segment from last week’s episode on YouTube instead. It’s a rare chance for non-HBO subscribers to get a glimpse of bizarro- Last-Week-Tonight . Ladies and gentlemen, meet Chiitan: Chiitan’s antics are not a matter of public concern outside of Susaki, Japan, but they’re a matter of public delight all over the world.

Burqa ban: Sri Lanka bans all face veils after Easter bombings.,slate.com,Daniel Politi,04-29-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/burqa-ban-sri-lanka-bans-face-veils-easter-bombings.html,"William Barr Is Cowering at the Prospect of a Proper Cross-Examination As of Monday, Muslim women in Sri Lanka will no longer be allowed to wear face veils in public . All types of face coverings that could hide someone’s identity are now banned in the country under an emergency law. The measure was imposed a week after more than 250 people were killed in a series of bombings that targeted churches and hotels. “President Maithripala Sirisena took this decision to further support the ongoing security and help the armed forces to easily identify the identity of any wanted perpetrators,” read a news release from the president’s office. Catholics in Sri Lanka, meanwhile, were not able to attend Sunday Mass as churches remained shut amid fears of further attacks. Many Catholics stayed home and watched a televised service given by the Archbishop of Colombo Malcolm Ranjith from his home. In a sign of unity, President Maithripala Sirisena, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, and former president and opposition leader Mahinda Rajapaksa attended the service in person. “This is a time our hearts are tested by the great destruction that took place last Sunday,” Ranjith said during his televised Mass. “This is a time questions such as, does God truly love us, does he have compassion toward us, can arise in human hearts.” The concern of further attacks comes amid warnings from both local officials and the U.S. Embassy that more attacks could be imminent. In an illustration of how serious the threat could be, authorities say they found a sophisticated bomb-making operation at a site where three militants blew themselves up after law enforcement officials found them. Police also raided the headquarters of the hardline Islamist group National Thawheed Jammath (NTJ) that was founded by the man suspected of being the mastermind behind the Easter bombings. Authorities believe the founder of NTJ, Zahran Hashim, was one of the nine suicide bombers. Support our journalism

Game of Thrones: The cinematography in the Battle of Winterfell was too dark for many viewers to see.,slate.com,Matthew Dessem,04-29-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/game-of-thrones-long-night-dark-cinematography-twitter-complaints.html,"SPOILERS FOLLOW! BEWARE! TAKE CARE! This week’s Game of Thrones was ostensibly about the Battle of Winterfell, the final confrontation between the armies of the evil Night King and the forces of humanity. But for many viewers, the episode was much more than an epic battle: It was also a whirlwind tour of the limits of video compression algorithms and home video display technology. Which is to say that a lot of people couldn’t see anything . On Sunday night, Twitter was full of viewers complaining about the show’s cinematography, which has often been dark, but never quite so consistently stygian. Dave Itzkoff of the New York Times summed up the general impression the episode made on many: just an incredible episode so far pic.twitter.com/43JpqyvWbj — Dave Itzkoff (@ditzkoff) April 29, 2019 In reality, Fabian Wagner’s cinematography on the episode, aptly named “The Long Night,” wasn’t quite as dark as Itzkoff’s screenshot, but it wasn’t exactly bright either. Here’s a random still captured from the HBO Now version on a laptop, then cropped to Slate’s preferred aspect ratio and slightly enlarged. It is murky : HBO I specified where and how I got that image and what I did to it afterward because what’s going on here isn’t just the artistic decision to shoot Game of Thrones in very low light, or to stage the Battle of Winterfell as a horror movie in which the living dead abruptly loom out of the snowy darkness. Those were both good decisions, and it’s hard to think of a better recent use of darkness than the defeat of the Dothraki in this week’s episode. The problem is that the entire television infrastructure that distributes Game of Thrones , from the cameras in Ireland to the eyeball in your own personal head, does a uniquely bad job with dimly lit scenes. And “The Long Night” was practically nothing else. The trend toward darker television has been going on for a while, and not just on HBO. As several prestige-TV cinematographers explained to Slate back in 2016 , the switch to digital filming and post-production made it easier and faster to work in low light than it had been on film. Simultaneously, the switch from cathode-ray tubes to high definition televisions made that same low-light cinematography look worse than it ever had before, especially on lower-end models. Meanwhile, cable companies switched to digital distribution , applying their own video compression to the already-compressed signals they got from networks. Streaming services like HBO Now do the same thing in order to fit HDTV signals into as little internet bandwidth as possible. Every time lossy video compression is applied to the video, the image quality drops. And guess what kind of scenes current video compression techniques do the worst job with? It’s a perfect storm: Every recent advance in television technology seems to have been designed specifically to make “The Long Night” difficult to make out.

Thanks for signing up! You can manage your newsletter subscriptions at any time. There are ways for a home viewer to mitigate the damage, first and foremost by darkening the room. Watching over internet streaming is better in many cases too, because it means cutting your cable company out of the loop, and the compressed versions of HBO Now episodes, which can be encoded in advance, might undergo a little more quality control than the versions cable companies create on the fly from HBO’s live feed. And calibrating your television, even if that just means using the signal patterns on a THX DVD or Blu-Ray to set the brightness and contrast, will do a lot to help. (As a bonus, paying attention to any or all of those things will make everything you watch look better, not just Game of Thrones .) But there’s just no way to feed images like the ones in “The Long Night” into the current television distribution system and have them look good in everyone’s living room. So can anything be done? Well, there’s a tradition in the music industry of taking the final mix of a recording and testing it out on a car stereo, to see what the beautiful music playing out of the expensive monitor speakers in the studio sounds like when it’s filtered through crappy car speakers, competing with engine noise. The reason audio engineers do this is not because they love the way music sounds in a 1989 Honda Civic. It’s because they have no control over the listening environment where their work will eventually be heard, and they want to make sure it’s tolerable even under the worst of circumstances. There’s a trade-off, of course: a car radio–friendly mix might sound a little worse than the original version when it’s played on a high-end stereo in a soundproof room. It’s lowering the ceiling to raise the floor, and normally I’m not very sympathetic to that kind of approach. But we’re on Game of Thrones ’ eighth season: If the general public were going to calibrate their televisions or darken their rooms in order to appreciate thecinematography, they would have done it by now. So if TV directors aren’t already making a point of running their work through the worst compression algorithm any cable company uses, then watching it on a cheap LED screen in a room with plenty of natural light, it’s probably time to start. If they need an unsuitable-for- Game-of-Thrones living room to use as a model for their test environment, Game of Thrones Twitter is full of potential volunteers."

Ian McEwan’s Machines Like Me and science fiction.,slate.com,Laura Miller,04-29-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/ian-mcewan-science-fiction-machines-like-me.html,"A Military Strategist Defends the Living Army’s Tactics in the Battle of Winterfell Every so often, a literary novelist offends the community of science fiction writers and fans. They can be touchy, given that their genre is often misrepresented by outsiders. For example, despite having, by her own account, written, read, and enjoyed many science fiction novels, Margaret Atwood once described the genre as “ talking squids in outer space ,” a statement that has reliably fueled outrage for a decade and counting. (Although, with admirable humor, the science fiction novelist Vonda McIntyre created a web site, Talking Squids in Outer Space , dedicated to enshrining examples of the genre using just that motif.) The latest and most egregious example is Ian McEwan. In an interview with the Guardian , the author of Atonement asserted that his new novel, Machines Like Me , takes the motif of artificial intelligence into new territory by addressing it “not in terms of travelling at 10 times the speed of light in anti-gravity boots, but in actually looking at the human dilemmas of being close up to something that you know to be artificial but which thinks like you.” As many commentators have pointed out , this absurd statement exhibits ignorance of a huge swath of well-known science fiction, from the writings of Philip K. Dick to films and TV series like 2001: A Space Odyssey and Westworld , all of which do precisely what McEwan claims is groundbreaking about his own novel. If McEwan had read some of the genre’s best treatments of this theme, Machines Like Me might have been a better book. The novel is set in an alternate version of the 1980s, one far more advanced technologically than the one we’re familiar with. The narrator, Charlie Friend, is a day trader with a shabby London flat and a rattletrap car, but when he gets a small inheritance from his late mother, he blows 84,000 pounds on a robot, a newly released model nearly indistinguishable in appearance from a young man. At the same time, he falls in love with his upstairs neighbor, Miranda. Over time, a romantic triangle between man, woman, and android develops. McEwan has often been celebrated for his interest in science, but the alternate history he has created for this fiction is even more rickety than Charlie’s car. Charlie’s world surpasses our own, posits McEwan, with such impressive advances as “brain-machine interfacing” and organic-seeming androids, because Alan Turing, instead of committing suicide at 41, has survived into old age. Brilliant as Turing was, this vein of Great Man sentimentalism is silly. For example, if McEwan thought about it a bit, he’d have realized that creating a product like Adam, Charlie’s robot, would require advances in many more fields than artificial intelligence. It would take chemical, engineering, and industrial genius to create a material that looked, felt, and functioned like living human skin.

Thanks for signing up! You can manage your newsletter subscriptions at any time. Any writer asking his readers to enter into an imaginary world different from the one around us faces a challenge: how to ease the reader into this altered reality without resorting to long passages of exposition. Over the decades, science fiction writers have developed a sophisticated range of narrative tools to help them do this. Dick’s The Man in the High Castle —set in a counterfactual history in which the Axis powers won World War II and are occupying the former United States—opens his novel with a scene in which a shopkeeper selling Americana caters fawningly to a stylish Japanese couple. Everything about the interaction, including how the shopkeeper tries to suss out the rank and influence of his new customers, conveys what the reader needs to know about the world Dick’s characters inhabit. Part of the pleasure of reading novels like this comes from surmising the rest. Real people don’t spend a lot of time musing on the broader historical context of their everyday lives. But in Machines Like Me , they do, and the novel is larded with long, tedious passages of potted history:
Nothing proved more vividly the maxim that technology renders civilisation fragile than the great traffic paralyses of the late seventies. By then, autonomous vehicles comprised seventeen per cent of the total. Who can forget that roasting rush-hour evening of the Manhattan Logjam? Due to an exceptional solar pulse, many on-board radars failed at once. McEwan might have decided that he didn’t want to bother with concocting a rationalized, convincing world in which to set Machines Like Me. Science fiction writers do that, too! For example, time travel is the only unrealistic touch in Octavia Butler’s Kindred , and in his first novel, Gun, With Occasional Music , Jonathan Lethem makes no effort to explain the technology behind procedures that allow animals to become as intelligent as people or couples to trade erogenous zones. The “science” in this type of science fiction either serves as a handy device (transporting a girl from the 1970s to an antebellum slave plantation) or as a metaphor for the disjunctions and perplexities of contemporary life. McEwan seems to be after the latter effect—he’s not really interested in how a machine like Adam could be engineered—but he also seems to have fallen in love with the half-baked historical scenario he’s come up with as a backdrop for his robot love story. (In addition to Turing’s survival, this alternate 1980s has got a Beatles reunion and Britain losing the Falkland Islands War.) The result works neither as a parable of free will and selfhood nor as an experiment in imagining the quandaries waiting in our future. If only McEwan could strap on those antigravity boots and travel at 10 times the speed light back into the past. Then he could start this lazy, flimsy novel over, only this time with the humility to learn from those who have boldly gone before. "

Spanish elections: Far-right Vox party does worse than expected but still crosses historic threshold.,slate.com,Brietta Hague,04-29-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/spanish-election-vox-party-far-right-congress.html,"Bibi Wins Reelection—and With Trump in the White House, There’s Nothing Stopping Israel’s Drift to the Right BARCELONA, Spain —Chants of “viva España” echoed through the drab hotel conference room on Sunday night as Vox party supporters waited to see if they would be a new force in Spanish politics. A white-haired woman waving a Spanish flag danced awkwardly in front of a large television screen in a bid to brighten the mood. But early news from the TV pundits was making the crowd nervous. A record 75.8 percent of Spaniards had turned out to vote. And Vox officials knew it was probably because so many people were afraid of their party. “Vox is a party that generates a lot of sympathy and a lot of antipathy,” Juan Carlos Segura, a Vox candidate for regional office in Catalonia, told me. “A lot of people are scared because they think we’re an extreme-right party. But in reality, we are not.” The world first noticed Vox in December when it unexpectedly won 12 seats in regional elections in Andalusia. Before then it had been a little-known fringe party promoting a hard-line nationalist, anti-immigration, and anti-feminist agenda. But growing public concern over Muslim migration and disquiet over Catalonia’s independence push bolstered its support. While the party rejects the far-right label, its campaign has run on the promise of repealing domestic violence legislation, restricting abortion, and embarking on a new reconquista , or reconquest. Spain had not had a far-right party in its national parliament since democracy was restored in 1981. Many had long believed that the long period of right-wing dictatorship under Gen. Francisco Franco, who died in 1975, had made Spain immune to the nativist, nationalistic movements now on the rise across the rest of Europe. Suddenly, it seemed to critics, the barbarians were at the gate. “I’m terrified,” one Catalan acquaintance told me before the election, saying his parents planned to send his gay brother abroad if Vox came to power. “These fascists, who are anti-women, anti–gay rights, and anti-immigration, come from the days of Franco. They descend from prominent business and families of that era. They’ve been lying dormant.” While the party rejects the far-right label, its campaign has run on the promise of repealing domestic violence legislation, restricting abortion, and embarking on a new reconquista , or reconquest, a reference to the Christian knights who drove the Muslim Moors from Spain. The party has been taking advice from former Trump Svengali Steve Bannon on how to sell its agenda. Slick social media postings projected a populist message of making Spain great again. Even in the left-wing stronghold of Catalonia and its regional capital Barcelona, Vox was campaigning hard to win over Catalans concerned about the dangers of separatism and to energize Spaniards who had been moving for generations to the relatively affluent northeast in search of jobs. Catalans were exhausted by the independence movement, according to Segura. “The [Catalan] nationalists have access to public money, which they use for independence propaganda. A party like Vox, with great aspirations not only to end separatism but to eliminate Catalan autonomy and restore the autonomy of Spain, has had the confidence and support of many people during the campaign,” he said. In cosmopolitan Barcelona, the party was putting forward its most presentable face, choosing Ignacio Garriga, black dentist and NYU graduate, as its highest-profile candidate. The son of African migrants, Garriga spent the campaign arguing for expelling tens of thousands of undocumented migrants. “Vox is not racist. Just look at me,” he told the El Mundo newspaper . “Look into my eyes and tell me if I can despise my mother or my grandmother who are black.” But the presence of two police vans and heavily armed officers outside Vox’s election night venue was a testament to the fact that Catalonia has at times felt like enemy territory for the Vox campaign. Every rally has been shadowed and harassed by hostile crowds of anarchists and independence activists. “We like dialogue, democracy, and we are tolerant,” Segura said. “But parties of the extreme left don’t accept this. When we rally, they throw rocks at us, they physically attack many of our people, including children, with iron bars. No one from Vox is aggressive to anyone.” At a rally in the neighbouring Catalan town of Terrassa on Thursday, mainly elderly Vox supporters had to run the gantlet of antifa demonstrators shouting, “Fascists!” “They are like Franco,” said Alba, a member of the local antifa collective. “They’re primarily running against independence and that’s their principal slogan, but behind that is a fascist agenda. We’ve been in a financial crisis for years and years, and people blame foreigners and immigration, and Vox is popular for this reason. They also blame social problems on feminist movements.” Vox had gone into election night hoping to win up to 37 of the 350 total seats in the Congress of Deputies and potentially enter a new right-wing coalition government. But as the night wore on, the mood in the gathering in Barcelona shifted from nervous to somber, even with a stirring ’80s rock version of the national anthem blaring over the speakers. It became clear that the ultranationalist wave was not going to be quite the tsunami they had hoped for. Ignacio Garriga won a seat, but all the party’s other Catalonia candidates fell short. Across Spain, the party won just 24 seats with 10 percent of the vote. Just as people were starting to leave, Garriga and his entourage entered the venue for the first time to announce he was happy with the result. “Today is a day to celebrate, friends. Spain has stood up today. Today is the starting point of the reconquest throughout the length and breadth of the nation,” he told the crowd. It’s not the triumph Vox had hoped for, but it’s still a momentous development for Spain. With seats inside Parliament, Vox will now be able to challenge conservative parties to embrace its ultranationalist agenda. The party’s success has come at the expense of Spain’s traditional right. Partido Popular, once the conservative party of power, suffered its worst-ever defeat, losing 71 seats. Like Vox, it won just a single seat in Catalonia. The biggest winner of the night was the center-left Partido Socialista Obrero Español, which had run a minority government before calling snap elections after Catalan independence parties withdrew support. The left-wing Unidas Podemos party, once a bitter rival to the Socialists, also did well, winning 42 seats. With no party winning a majority, the coming days will be dominated by horse-trading to form a coalition or workable minority government. All signs are that the left will dominate. The Socialists may even be able to take power without needing the support of Catalonia’s independence party. The right, for now, is in a smaller minority. But Ignacio Garriga promises it is just the beginning: “Spain has stood up and said that it wants 24 brave people to enter the Congress to say—until now—what no party has said.”"

Attorney General Barr Threatens to Cancel House Testimony on Mueller Report Amid Format Dispute,slate.com,Daniel Politi,04-28-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/attorney-general-william-barr-threatens-cancel-house-testimony-mueller.html,"Ocasio-Cortez Accuses Kellyanne Conway of Trying to “Stoke Suspicion Around My Christianity” Attorney General William Barr has threatened he may not show up to his scheduled testimony before the House Judiciary Committee about special counsel Robert Mueller’s report on Thursday as his office has made it clear to Democrats that he is none too happy with the format of the hearing. CNN was first to report the story, which was later confirmed by several others, citing an unnamed committee source that said Barr wouldn’t go to the hearing unless there was a change in the proposed format. Failing to attend the hearing would mark a huge escalation in tensions between the Trump administration and Democrats , who have requested to see the full, unredacted Mueller report. There are two basic sticking points. First, House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler has proposed that after lawmakers complete their allotted time for questioning there would be an additional 30-minute round for each side of the aisle in which Democratic and Republican counsels could question Barr . “The attorney general agreed to appear before Congress. Therefore, members of Congress should be the ones doing the questioning,” Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said. “He remains happy to engage with members on their questions regarding the Mueller report.” Barr is also reportedly opposed to the idea of moving to a closed session if lawmakers want to discuss parts of special counsel Robert Mueller’s report that were redacted. Nadler was defiant Sunday morning, telling CNN that Barr would not “dictate the format of the Judiciary Committee.” Nadler added that “the witness is not going to tell the committee how to conduct its hearing, period.” Asked what could be the next step if Barr doesn’t agree to testify, Nadler didn’t mince words. “Then we will have to subpoena him, and we will have to use whatever means we can to enforce the subpoena,” he said. Barr is scheduled to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday and the House committee on Thursday. Seeing as though the hearing is still a few days away, the two sides could still come up with some sort of compromise that would allow it to move forward as scheduled."
"Democratic 2020 primary unity pledges urged by activist group, George Takei.",slate.com,Ben Mathis-Lilley,04-29-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/democratic-2020-primary-unity-pledges-indivisible-george-takei.html,"Rod Rosenstein, the Man Responsible for the Mueller Investigation, Resigns The latest hot trend in Democrat World is to ask primary candidates and their supporters to take a “unity pledge.” The grassroots activist group Indivisible launched its version last Thursday, which calls in general terms for a “constructive” primary in which “shared values” are highlighted and everyone immediately gets behind the eventual nominee rather than continuing to hold grudges for the next 1,000 years . On Friday and Saturday, #resistance celebs George Takei and Alyssa Milano, whose combined Twitter/Instagram followers total 9.94 million, took things a step further and asked their social-media hordes to agree not to speak “negatively” about anyone in the race at all: Will you join me in pledging not to speak negatively about any of our candidates? We don’t know who the nominee will be, but they need to be as strong as they can be going into the election against Trump. — George Takei (@GeorgeTakei) April 26, 2019 #IPledge to not speak negatively about anyone running for President. Do you? https://t.co/d5VKX30Dyy — Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano) April 27, 2019 The motivation here is the idea that nasty primary campaigns can depress the enthusiasm of the losers’ supporters; Indivisible has addressed that problem directly by scheduling a “Weekend of Action” after the Democratic National Convention during which supporters of both winning and losing primary candidates will be able to join hands to knock on doors and make phone calls for the nominee. Another motivation is the idea that negative primary campaigning can pre-emptively destroy the winning candidate’s reputation among general-election swing voters, hence the Takei/Milano/My Mom model, in which if you can’t say something nice you shouldn’t say anything at all. The problem with unity enforcement, though, is that it tends to protect the status quo, because it means never criticizing the frontrunner, which gives party insiders and major donors—who are free to line up behind particular candidates before they even launch their “exploratory committees”—even more influence than they already have. Joe Biden, for example, has already gotten more endorsements from top party figures than any other candidate despite having only been in the race for only a week, and he leads in most polls in part by virtue of name recognition. But is the average Democratic voter really well served by a regime in which it’s considered improper to criticize Biden? Or, to be more specific, is the country better off if Democrats aren’t complaining that Biden held his first official campaign fundraiser at the home of the man who supervises lobbying operations for Comcast , a monopolistic mega-corporation that is reviled by its customers ? If it’s not cool to complain about that kind of thing, why even have a Democratic Party at all? It seems like Indivisible’s version of the pledge would allow me to make this point, for what it’s worth, so long as I did so while emphasizing shared values (let’s say by pointing out that 77 percent of Democrats favor the enactment of laws restricting the amount of influence that big donors have on the political process) and presenting constructive context (let’s say by pointing out that candidates like Elizabeth Warren and John Hickenlooper have already outlined proposals to prevent further monopolization of the American economy). Alyssa Milano’s unity pledge, however, would forbid me from speaking my truth. But as I have always said, I will not be silenced by Alyssa Milano. Joe Biden, do better! Support our journalism

Samantha Bee roasts Trump at Not the White House Correspondents' Dinner (VIDEO).,slate.com,Natalia Winkelman,04-29-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/samantha-bee-full-frontal-white-house-correspondents-dinner.html,"A Military Strategist Defends the Living Army’s Tactics in the Battle of Winterfell At the White House Correspondents’ Dinner on Saturday night, the annual event replaced its usual comedian speaker with a historian instead , breaking with tradition in favor of a less-controversial speech. Unsurprisingly, Donald Trump skipped the celebration once again, marking the third year in a row in which the president, none too keen on jokes at his own expense, has refused to attend. But while the official dinner passed with little laughter , Samantha Bee took the reins on a much livelier parallel event: the second ever Not the White House Correspondents’ Dinner. The Full Frontal affair was launched in 2017 as an alternative to the main event, and this year’s installment, which aired at the same time as the official historian-led dinner, proved just how crucial Bee’s efforts to support journalists and free speech are turning out to be.

A Police Shooting at Yale Shows How Campus Police Have Fostered a Climate of Fear,slate.com,TJ Grayson,04-29-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/stephanie-washington-yale-shooting-campus-police.html,"William Barr Is Cowering at the Prospect of a Proper Cross-Examination Sitting in the front seats of their car earlier this month, Stephanie Washington and Paul Witherspoon could be seen in a cellphone video singing love songs to one another, laughing, smiling, and apparently savoring each other’s presence. Soon after, both of these young, black New Haven, Connecticut, residents would be under gunfire, and Washington would be shot in the face, sustaining injuries. Neither posed a threat, but that didn’t matter to the Yale and Hamden police who shot at them. On April 16, Yale police officer Terrance Pollock and Hamden police officer Devin Eaton opened fire on Washington and Witherspoon. While the bullets missed Witherspoon, some of the more than 15 shots hit Washington, who now appears to be in stable condition. The involvement of university police in this tragic event implicates the entire Yale community. As a Yale Law School student, I, along with the thousands of students who walk the streets of New Haven and enjoy the privileges that come with our institutional affiliation, am culpable for this act of police violence. As a Yale Law School student, my tuition helped fund this life-threatening incident. And as a black Yale Law School student, I know how easily that same violence could have been directed toward me . Yale’s current approach to policing has created a confusing and complicated accountability structure. Since the shooting shined a light on New Haven’s convoluted system of policing, students and activists have taken their demands for justice to the streets , following the lead of local organizers like Kerry Ellington from New Haven for Black Lives. The presence of multiple police forces—Yale Police (YPD), Hamden Police, and New Haven Police—has resulted in a complex and fear-inducing degree of surveillance. This concern is not unfounded. In recent years, there have been other prominent incidents of overpolicing in New Haven. Last year, a black student was accosted by several police officers after falling asleep in a common room of a dorm; four years ago, a Yale police officer pulled a gun on the son of New York Times columnist Charles Blow. Other black Yale students have expressed concern over what has been described as a climate of racial profiling. The anxiety and concern this atmosphere creates warrants interrogation, particularly as a rapidly increasing number of universities follow in Yale’s footsteps and begin the controversial process of expanding the authority of campus police. Ultimately, Yale’s resources must be better spent. Rather than financing a subsidiary community police force, Yale should limit the authority of YPD and invest directly in New Haven by paying the taxes the city’s residents have been demanding for years. University police forces like Yale’s maintain contracts with host cities whereby the scope of their authority is defined. Often, as in Yale’s case, these university-funded officers function as a sworn police force, with many of the same responsibilities as the city’s. These agreements are frequently framed as a necessary form of institutional support from the university to the city: Campus police forces like YPD are known for being better trained, paid, and resourced than police departments in the surrounding area. The true benefits, however, are being called into question. Yale and similar universities undoubtedly have an obligation to invest in the surrounding area. Yet tragedies like Washington and Witherspoon’s near-death experience demonstrate that this is not the way to do it. Yale’s current approach to policing has created a confusing and complicated accountability structure. This policing regime has been described by activists as a triple occupation, a perception rooted in fears of overpolicing. The significance of this perception alone cannot be overstated. In fact, professors here at Yale have shown that the distrust this creates between community members and the police weakens police legitimacy in a way that hinders the efficacy of policing itself. Yale is not alone, of course. Throughout the country, universities are bolstering the authority of campus police, ultimately complicating accountability mechanisms. As recent examples like Johns Hopkins’ restructuring of its campus police show , these expansions of power are often initiated in the face of intense opposition from community members. What’s a more effective way for universities like Yale to contribute to their surrounding areas? Paying their fair share in taxes. Cities like New Haven and Baltimore are resource-deprived. With a poverty rate of more than 25 percent, New Haven lacks the funds to effectively invest in a strong police force and violence-prevention programs that tackle crime. The implications of this lack of resources are severe. As sociologists like Robert Vargas have shown, this broad underfunding of government services has been known to intensify the very crime rates campus police are asked to address. This does not have to be the case. Despite their wealth, universities like Yale use almost every loophole possible to avoid taxes. Although Yale owns more than $100 million in real estate assets—making it the city’s fourth-largest property owner—it is a tax-exempt entity. From 2010 through 2015 , Yale avoided paying corporate income taxes on earnings from its $25 billion endowment, resulting in savings of $2.1 billion. During this same period, Yale saved $708 million in municipal property taxes, something many corporate entities would have paid. And again, Yale is not alone. Far too many universities, including Johns Hopkins , have leaped at opportunities to limit their contributions to the surrounding community by failing to pay a fair share in taxes. If universities truly care about the safety of their communities, they will invest directly in a way that would make institutions like YPD obsolete. Only then can universities like Yale begin to improve, rather than make worse, the lives of those in their city’s communities. Only then will these universities give their cities the autonomy they deserve when it comes to policing and begin to address the all-too-common violence inflicted on people like Stephanie Washington and Paul Witherspoon.

Game of Thrones tried to make Arya’s big moment both surprising and inevitable.,slate.com,Sam Adams,04-29-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/game-of-thrones-arya-night-king-battle-of-winterfell-long-night.html,"Game of Thrones Taught Us to Want Death. Then It Changed the Rules. She was meant for this. The Battle of Winterfell may have been the most complicated undertaking in Game of Thrones ’ history, but in retrospect, the episode had one simple purpose: convincing the audience that, after 70 hours and nearly eight years, the fitting ending for the show’s apparently immortal, nigh-all-powerful Night King was a knife in the gut from a teenage girl. The ground troops who were slaughtered by the thousands—and, in some cases, reanimated and killed again—didn’t matter in the end. It was Arya, with the Valyrian steel dagger, in the godswood. “The Long Night,” as the episode is formally called, splits roughly into two parts, the first concerned with what happens outside Winterfell’s walls, the second, after the dead breach the castle gates, set within them. During the first part, which she spends standing atop the battlements with her sister, Arya is mostly a bit player: She lets loose a few well-timed arrows (the Hound says thanks), exchanges some significant glances, and hands a dragonglass dagger to Sansa before sending her down to the crypt. When Sansa balks, insisting she doesn’t know how to use a weapon, Arya advises her to “stick ’em with the pointy end”—a reference that goes all the way back to the second episode of the series, when Jon Snow gave Arya her sword, Needle, with identical words of wisdom . The reversal is a reminder of how far Arya has come, but it also foreshadows the end of the episode, when she and Jon will switch their expected roles: He’ll be the one helplessly pinned down by a larger enemy, and she’ll be the one to slay the (figurative) dragon. The episode featured several nods to Arya’s past, including her sword-fighting tutelage in King’s Landing under Syrio Forel , whose refrain was picked up by the mystical Red Woman: “What do we say to the God of Death? Not today.” Fulfilling her prediction that they would meet again, Melisandre recalled her prophecy of the eyes Arya would one day shut forever : brown, green, and [pause for emphasis] blue. That took us back to Season 3 , two years before Arya began her assassin training in earnest, and two more before Bran passed on to her the dagger she would use to save his life and kill the Night King. (That dagger itself had been wending its way toward the climactic moment for years; it’s the one an assassin used to try to kill Bran in Season 1.) The episode also pointed ahead to its surprise ending by frequently cutting between Arya and Lyanna Mormont, also a pint-size female badass, who, while being crushed to death in an undead giant’s hand, still mustered the strength to draw her sword and stick him in the eye. (Underlining the idea that there’s no correlation between size and bravery, Lady Lyanna’s last stand and Arya’s battle with a horde of zombie wights were intercut with shots of the towering Sandor Clegane cowering against a wall.) “The Last Night” worked to conceal its Arya ex machina twist from first-time viewers, dropping Arya from most of its final act in hopes that we’d forget her purposefully striding away from the Red Woman and the Hound, a killing look set on her face. But watch it again and the episode is making a sustained argument—a plea, really—for us to see Arya’s killing of the Night King as a satisfying, even inevitable, culmination. This isn’t just chance—which is good, because no one is that lucky—it’s fate, the fruit of a design so grand that even the Three-Eyed Raven and the Red Woman can only glimpse its outlines. Beric Dondarrion, who’d come back from the dead a half-dozen times, lived so that he might sacrifice himself for Arya. Theon Greyjoy’s death might seem a pointless one—why charge at an enemy you know you can’t wound?—but you can theorize that he gained Arya the few precious seconds necessary to ensure she could launch herself at the Night King before he drew his sword and killed Bran. When Theon apologizes for betraying the Starks, Bran monotonously reassures him, “Everything you did brought you here,” a tautology tinged with mystical purpose. Seeing her father beheaded set Arya on a course to becoming a killer rather than watching others be killed, but here she’s face to face with the fear that her own death might be as pointless as Ned Stark’s. As the Hound says, they’re not just fighting the dead: They’re fighting Death, and death always wins in the end. The sequence’s mechanics are pure video game, but there’s real terror in Arya’s eyes, a vulnerability we haven’t seen since the days when Arya didn’t know which end of a sword to use. But when the Red Woman reminds her that she’s been training very nearly her whole life for this, she surmounts her fear. She’s been waiting for her moment, and so have we.

Richard Lugar: The late Republican senator helped protect the world from nuclear chaos and mentored Barack Obama.,slate.com,Fred Kaplan,04-29-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/richard-lugar-obituary-nuclear-policy-barack-obama.html,"Why Are Companies Buying Cyberinsurance That Doesn’t Cover Cyberattacks? Former Sen. Richard Lugar, who died on Sunday at the age of 87, was the most mild-mannered historic figure of our time, a moderate Republican whose signal achievement helped save the world from calamitous chaos. His passing is worth noting because nothing like his achievement could occur, nor could anyone like him rise to power, in today’s political climate. His great deed was the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction Act of 1991 , co-sponsored with Democratic Sen. Sam Nunn (bipartisan bills were routine in Congress back then), which, in the wake of the Soviet Union’s implosion, authorized $400 million a year to deactivate—over the years—7,500 nuclear warheads, shut down 47 biological weapons centers, retrain 58,000 weapons scientists, and lock up enough fissile material to build thousands of nuclear bombs, throughout the former Soviet republics. At the time of the act’s passage, Nunn was chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee and Lugar was ranking minority member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Some Soviet Consulate officials—whom they’d met while monitoring U.S.-Soviet arms control talks in Geneva—approached them with warnings that the world was in trouble. Officers guarding the Soviet nuclear stockpile were deserting in droves, leaving fissile materials and the weapons themselves open to rogue elements and terrorists. The Kremlin needed Western money to pay the guards and Western technicians to build new locks. There was initial reluctance, especially in some Republican circles, to spend American taxpayers’ dollars to beef up Russian security, but most lawmakers grasped the urgency. The bill easily passed the House and the Senate on voice votes. Over the next several years, “Nunn-Lugar” came to refer to a range of efforts to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons in the post–Cold War era. Its two sponsors traveled frequently to Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan—the former Soviet republics where nuclear weapons had been based—to witness the dangers, and observe the dismantlement, of missiles, warheads, and bombs. When I interviewed Lugar a year ago, for a forthcoming book on the history of American nuclear-war policy, he told me about one of his first inspection trips, to the Pervomaisk missile base in Ukraine, where he watched an enormous intercontinental ballistic missile, tipped with several nuclear warheads, being pulled out of its underground silo. He and his hosts took the long elevator ride down the tube to see the launch facility. The first thing he saw, when they reached the bottom, was a guard’s desk and, on the wall behind it, photographs of large American cities. It occurred to him: Those cities had been the targets of that missile. Like most politicians, like most Americans, Lugar—who had been mayor of Indianapolis before winning his first election to the Senate in 1976—hadn’t closely followed the arcana of the nuclear debate before this immersion. The thought made him shiver more than a little—and deepened his commitment to his new mission. His enthusiasm for foreign policy, once a plus for Republican candidates, was turned into a mark against him. Another historic consequence of all this was the role Lugar played in the education of Barack Obama. As a freshman senator in 2005, Obama nabbed a slot on the foreign relations committee and threw himself into the work. Often, as a hearing rambled on beyond its first hour, Obama and the committee chairman were the only senators in the room. Since the Republicans had taken control of the Senate two years earlier, the chairman was Lugar. Almost 30 years Obama’s senior, he was impressed and took to mentoring the up-and-comer. After a few of these hearings, Obama asked if he could tag along on one of Lugar’s visits to the former Soviet republics. They went together that August, on a weeklong tour of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons sites. It was an eventful trip: Russian border guards detained the senators for three hours at the airport in the Siberian city of Perm, demanding to search their aircraft, which they suspected was a spy plane. Top Kremlin officials, alerted by the U.S. Embassy, eventually ordered the guards to let the plane leave for its next stop, in Ukraine, and apologized to the senators. During their holdup, Obama and Lugar discussed the issues, and the politics of the issues, more deeply than they had before. When Obama became president three years later, his signal achievements on nuclear security all stemmed from his tutorship with Lugar. These included the U.S.-Russian New START, or Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty; the Iran nuclear deal; and the Nuclear Security Summits , which extended the aims of Nunn-Lugar and resulted in the removal or downgrading of enough highly enriched uranium to build nearly 7,000 nuclear bombs at more than 50 facilities in 30 countries, as well as the installation of radiation detectors at 329 international border crossings. After six terms in the Senate, Lugar was defeated in the 2012 primary by Indiana’s treasury secretary, a Tea Party candidate named Richard Mourdock, who was subsequently trounced in the general election by Democrat Joe Donnelly. Lugar lost because he was, by then, too moderate for the Republican Party. His enthusiasm for foreign policy, once a plus for Republican candidates, was turned into a mark against him. Lugar’s complacency, a trait of many multiterm incumbents, compounded the trend. One of Mourdock’s catchy lines was that Lugar had spent more time in Moscow, Russia, than in Russiaville, Indiana—and the jab hit a sore spot: Lugar hadn’t lived in his “home state” since 1977, when his Senate career began. After his defeat, Lugar established the Lugar Center, a Washington-based think tank affiliated with Indiana University and the University of Indianapolis.* Nunn left the Senate voluntarily, 16 years before Lugar, in 1996 after serving four terms, tired of holding a minority seat in a chamber that Republicans had recently taken over.* In 2001, he created, and still co-chairs, the Nuclear Threat Initiative , which has carried on the Nunn-Lugar Act’s work with private funding. There is no one like either of them in the Senate today—lawmakers who also see themselves as diplomats, more devoted to national policy than to party politics—and the country is poorer because of it.
Correction, April 29, 2019: This piece originally misstated that Nunn left the Senate six years before Lugar. It was 16 years before.
Correction, April 30, 2019: This piece originally misstated that the Lugar Center is sponsored by the University of Indiana. It is affiliated with Indiana University and the University of Indianapolis. Support our journalism

"Game of Thrones taught us to want death, then denied it.",slate.com,Willa Paskin,04-29-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/game-of-thrones-battle-of-winterfell-deaths.html,"Game of Thrones Tried to Make Arya’s Big Moment Both Surprising and Inevitable This post contains spoilers for Game of Thrones . At 8:04 EDT last night, 56 minutes before the third episode of the eighth season of Game of Thrones began, I got a text: “Hi would anyone like to speculate who is gonna die tonight on GOT. I have a list.” So did I. So did everyone else. The Battle of Winterfell was the long-awaited fight with the vast armies of the frozen undead, this was Game of Thrones , and obviously some people were going to die. Not just ancillary people, but substantial characters. Definitely Grey Worm. Probably Brienne. Perhaps Sam. Maybe even a Lannister. And then, instead, they didn’t. All respect to the Mormont line and Dolorous Edd (aka the guy whose name I had to look up four times, no dis!), these were not the people you’d expect to die in an epic battle, one HBO has promoted like it was a luxury handbag, its value unrelated to anything like utility or aesthetics but rendered only in terms of effort and cash. We had steeled ourselves for worse, for the death of someone who would really make us cry—and it didn’t come. I have seen this outcome described as fan service, but it is more singular than that. This was not what the audience wanted, exactly. We were busy cosplaying as Arya, running the death list over and over in our heads after all! (Grey Worm. Brienne. Jorah. Tyrion ? Could it be Tyrion?) Fans have been running down clues about who would die like a maniac CSI squad hellbent on determining a particular form of zombie death. And then, instead, barely anything. It’s like craving spaghetti for dinner, and then your parents feed you an ice cream sundae instead. Thank you. I will eat that. It tastes … good? But why are you serving this to me? In the beginning, Game of Thrones , following the lead of George R.R. Martin’s books, distinguished itself from other magical fantasy sagas with its attention to realistic detail, both tactile and tactical. Like HBO’s The Wire , Game of Thrones took a genre we were familiar with and refreshed it by wonking out. Armies of men with swords and spears would not just meet on battlefields. We would be let into the backroom dealings, the fumbling strategy sessions, the rancid, watery alleyways. Issues of winning and losing would jostle for space with questions like: How do you fund an army, how do you execute a war, how do you move a battalion across a sea, how do you rule, and above all how do you contend with the brutal accidents of brutal life? But for all of its attention to the strategic details usually glossed over in legends about future kings, nothing indicated Game of Thrones ’ differencefrom the fantasies that came before it like its willingness to do death—because there it broke not with just fantasy but nearly all fiction. From the moment that the heroic Ned Stark, decent yet unstrategic, found his head on a stake at the end of Season 1, Game of Thrones flouted a rule: Main characters don’t die. (A corollary: Main characters are on contract.) But on Game of Thrones , they did . On TV, death (like, literal darkness and nipples) can be a cheap shorthand for depth, proof not of seriousness but of seriosity. Sometimes shows kill people not to demonstrate the awful, wasteful carnality of life, but to prove they are a show about this very thing, now voyeuristically rendered for your viewing enjoyment. Game of Thrones has done much of this—hundreds of extras who have died bloody, crunchy, grimy deaths over its many seasons—but it has also given us deaths that were more than just some sick thrill. In killing Ned, and Robb, and Joffrey, in constantly violating basic structural storytelling conventions—don’t kill your heroes or your villains (till the end)—it brought us closer to the thudding, juddering unfairness, the finality and randomness, the awful abruptness, even when expected, of real death. And with these relatively early major character deaths, the audience became conditioned to expect more, and I don’t just mean in some Pavlovian way. ( Game of Thrones on. Time to slobber for dead meat.) We became, like many of the surviving characters, cynical. We learned to check our hope. Life on Game of Thrones is nasty, brutal, and short. Good people die and being too good might actually kill you. Strategy plays its part but so do chance and cruelty. There goes the Red Viper and Margaery (who I still like so much I checked how to properly spell her ridiculously spelled name), and there goes Stannis, and there goes a little girl burned to death on a stake by an evil witch, who, actually, it turns out could kind of see the future a quarter of the time. Life is horrible. But then, around when Jon Snow was stabbed to death and resurrected as a man with an important mission (but still no ability to make varied facial expressions), something new began to settle on Game of Thrones , a new feeling, a new flavor: untouchability . Jon Snow was inviolable. Was Dany? What about the Starks and Lannisters? This new vibe hung over the show, but it was hard to tell if it was really here to stay. It was late enough in the show’s run, these characters were beloved enough, that they needed a proper sendoff before death, right? OK, well, here was the Battle of Winterfell. A proper sendoff! We weren’t spoiled, but we all knew what was coming. And then it didn’t. We in the audience, panting for death, may be creepy, we may be callous and bloodthirsty, but we seem to have learned the lesson of the show—that happy endings are for stories—better than the show has learned it itself. With each episode of the final season, Game of Thrones has painted itself further into a corner where the end will decide how good or bad the whole thing really was. Is this a show about a morally complicated, morally impossible world? Or is this just a fantasy wrapped in complicated, fetid clothing that it is now throwing off piece by piece, revealing it was basic all along: a quest for the good leader who will restore order to the land, a legend about how systemic evil can be defeated by one (really) badass girl. There are, of course, three episodes left, and surely, deaths will come. (Definitely, still, a Lannister.) But whatever happens, we are squarely back inside a story where death is deployed not with the horrible casualness of life but with the care—and the restraints—of fiction. In acquiescing to this convention, the show has cast off what was most original and truthful about it: the way it illustrated death’s complete lack of cooperation with the wants of men. You do not really get to tell death “not today.” But on Game of Thrones , now you do. The Game of Thrones TV Club Recaps Season 8

He is known as the first black American to be nominated for an Academy Award for Best Director for his 1991 film Boyz n the Hood , an achievement that paved the way for black filmmakers like Steve McQueen, Barry Jenkins, and Spike Lee, who have each received directing nominations in the years since. Lee and Singleton became longtime friends, and while discussing Lee’s BlacKkKlansman on the Directors Guild of America’s The Director’s Cut podcast in August , the pair reminisced about the time when they first met. It was the summer of 1986, when Lee was promoting his debut feature, She’s Gotta Have It , in Los Angeles. Singleton, who was 18 at the time, says that he was visiting a Santa Monica theater to see Akira Kurosawa’s Ran when he first caught a glimpse of Lee’s film. “I saw the trailer to She’s Gotta Have It , with my man taking out tube socks on the street,” Singleton remembers, referring to the film’s high-concept movie preview , in which Lee peddles socks and begs moviegoers to buy enough tickets so that he can give up the side hustle. Singleton remembered thinking, while watching the trailer, “I gotta come, I gotta come be here.” When Singleton returned to the cinema the following week, Lee was greeting viewers out front. “I was outside the theater passing out buttons,” Lee says. “He came up to me—what did you say?” “I said, ‘I’m going to film school at USC in two weeks,’ ” Singleton recalls. ” ‘Watch out for me.’ ” Upon hearing news of Singleton’s passing, Lee wrote a remembrance of the initial encounter on Instagram: “Over many years people have told me ‘I’m going to be a filmmaker’, when John said that to me the 1st time we met, I believed him right away. It was no surprise.”"
Michael Avenatti pleads not guilty to dozens of charges that he was better at stealing than lawyering.,slate.com,Elliot Hannon,04-29-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/michael-avenatti-pleads-not-guilty-stormy-daniels-lawyer-fraud-hassan-whiteside.html,"Swarthmore Students Occupy Frat House After Documents Leak With Reference to “Rape Attic” Attorney Michael Avenatti was in federal court Monday, this time as a defendant pleading not guilty to 36 counts , which include wire and bank fraud relating to a series of alleged embezzlement schemes that saw him swipe money from a paraplegic man and the ex-girlfriend of an NBA player. It’s quite an astonishing fall for the man who made his name as former porn star Stormy Daniels’ attorney as she battled with former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen and then, somehow, grew in stature to a national anti-Trump spokesman camped out on CNN and MSNBC taking shots at the president in the name of decency and justice. For a moment, Avenatti’s ascent had reached so high that he even toyed with running for president himself before things started to unravel for the 48-year-old. “With a public defender at his side, the 48-year-old Avenatti pleaded not guilty to all charges in the 36-count indictment which alleges that he stole more than $12 million in settlement money from five of his clients, failed to file income tax returns, failed to pay millions in taxes, submitted fraudulent loan applications and concealing assets from bankruptcy court,” CBS L.A. reports . Even in the age of Trump that, um, isn’t exactly presidential material. The allegations made against Avenatti aren’t pretty. Here’s what prosecutors are accusing Avenatti of in the case that is expected to go to trial on June 25: • Stealing $4 million from a paraplegic man to finance a coffee business. • Embezzling $2.5 million from the ex-girlfriend of Miami Heat player Hassan Whiteside to purchase a portion of a private jet. • Failing to file personal income tax returns from 2010 onward. • Using fake financial data and forged personal income tax returns in order to secure $4.1 million in loans from a bank in Mississippi. In an unrelated, but equally not great development, Avenatti was also charged last month with trying to extort more than $20 million from Nike. Avenatti 2020!"
William Barr is cowering at the prospect of a proper cross-examination. - Slate Magazine,slate.com,,04-29-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/william-barr-jerry-nadler-testimony-judiciary-committee.html,"This piece first appeared on the blog Impeachable Offenses . This weekend brought a subtle, but important, bit of good news for those interested in effective congressional investigations of the Trump administration. Attorney General William Barr is threatening to refuse the request of the House Judiciary Committee that he testify later this week. Reportedly, Barr is balking because the committee will deviate from the pattern of recent congressional hearings in which members do all the questioning and every member gets a paltry three to five minutes to ask questions of the witness, with no opportunity for follow-up. Instead, House Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler is delegating some of the questioning to committee lawyers who will have 30 minutes to pursue lines of questioning to their logical conclusions. There may also be a private session about any classified materials in the Mueller report. The “get every Member on camera for five minutes” mode of proceeding has long had those of us who are trial lawyers tearing our hair and screaming at our TV sets (or computer screens). It is guaranteed to be ineffectual for three reasons: First, cross-examination, particularly of reluctant or hostile witnesses, is the single most difficult trial skill. To do it well takes training and years of practice. Perishingly few members of either the House or Senate have the professional background to have mastered it. For most of those few, the experience was years in the past, and they’ve lost their edge. Second, the best cross-examiner in the world can do little if confined to an arbitrary five-minute limit. Thus, even the rare talented congressional interrogator can be filibustered for five minutes by any reasonably self-possessed witness. It is extraordinarily heartening to see that Nadler seems to have learned a lesson from history. Third, sequential questioning by members could be made fractionally more effective if all the members (or at least all the members of one party) carefully coordinated the topics and lines of questioning to be pursued. But there is little indication that this is ever done, and it would require a degree of diligence, focus, and cooperative spirit improbable in a group composed of office-seekers eager to get individual, and distinctive, face time. If you want an eye-opening contrast to the aimlessness and patent grandstanding of most modern congressional hearings, go watch the proceedings of the Senate and House committees investigating Nixon and Watergate. Three key differences jump out: First, the committee’s professional counsel did much of the questioning; second, they were unconstrained by artificial time limits; and third, the senators and congressmen of both parties were prepared for their turns at questioning and were obviously interested in learning the truth. Moreover, in order to promote candor and avoid concerns about unfairly besmirching reputations, a number of the key hearings were held in private . The result was that, in Watergate, both the Senate and House hearings were genuine factual inquiries in which witnesses were compelled to answer questions comprehensively and explain inconsistencies in their stories. Both sets of hearings maintained coherent narratives and exposed important facts that would not otherwise have come to light. It is extraordinarily heartening to see that Nadler seems to have learned a lesson from history. Barr’s anguished cries at the prospect of a modest move back toward earlier and more productive modes of procedure should be seen as what they are—the vain protestations of a lawyer who knows the power of competent cross-examination and desperately wants to avoid having it directed at him. That said, Nadler’s proposal is only a modest step in the right direction. The staff questioning will still be broken up into five-minute alternating chunks between majority and minority counsel, which is sadly reminiscent of the clumsy experiment by the Senate Judiciary Committee’s Republican majority in the Kavanaugh Supreme Court confirmation hearings. Nadler should do two things. He should stick to his guns in this confrontation with Barr. And in the future, he should move even more firmly in the direction of procedural rules that, in living memory, facilitated the discovery of truth. Committees of both the House and Senate who want facts should follow and build on his example. Support our journalism

Bernie Sanders 2020: Trying to restore the vote to prisoners hurts more than it helps.,slate.com,Jon Sherman,04-29-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/bernie-sanders-felon-voting-enfranchisement-democrats-2020.html,"Swarthmore Students Occupy Frat House After Documents Leak With Reference to “Rape Attic” With every passing week, there seems to be a new litmus test for Democratic presidential candidates. Last week’s was whether a felon should be permitted to vote while serving time in prison. At CNN town halls on April 22, Sen. Bernie Sanders endorsed the idea of enfranchising those currently serving prison sentences, Mayor Pete Buttigieg did not, and former prosecutor Sen. Kamala Harris hedged, calling for “a conversation.” But no one’s commitment to voting rights should be judged based on a policy that has been adopted by only two states —Maine and Sanders’ Vermont. This is not a pragmatic or strategic approach to changing these laws in the near future. Reasonable people—including those who care deeply about civil rights and democracy—can and do differ on whether felons should be allowed to vote during incarceration, even as more and more citizens and their representatives favor earlier and easier restoration of this right. There are millions of disenfranchised people nationwide who have completed their prison sentences , and restoring their right to vote would constitute a tectonic shift in civil rights. Focusing on this widely popular policy goal before trying something that is far less agreed upon is not just practical politics but also smart policy. Most states restore voting rights at some point after incarceration, usually following parole or probation, while an ever-shrinking minority of states require a felon to petition the state government for restoration. But only 15 states —plus the District of Columbia—restore voting rights immediately upon release from incarceration. Bringing 33 additional states into that column would constitute an enormous change—a “revolution” by any definition. It would immediately restore the voting rights of millions who are still completing a period of supervised release but who have successfully finished their prison terms. Permitting parolees and probationers to vote helps reintegrate them into society, and there is some evidence that it can diminish the chances that a person will break the law again . There is also already momentum for change on this issue, as evidenced by the passage of a constitutional amendment in Florida restoring voting rights to most felons who have completed their sentences, Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s decision to reenfranchise parolees in New York, and Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds’ support for amending the Iowa Constitution to restore voting rights to returning citizens who have completed their sentences. There is already momentum for change on this issue. But as any observer of the state legislative debates on this issue knows, there is no nationwide consensus or trend in favor of Maine and Vermont’s policy to let all felons vote, including those still in prison for the most serious and violent crimes. This year in New Mexico, where Democrats control both houses of the legislature and the governor is a Democrat, a bill to end all felon disenfranchisement , including during incarceration, stalled in committee. By the time legislators decided to amend it to restoration following release from prison—which would have restored an estimated 16,000 people—they ran out of time and the bill failed . Now, nothing will pass until 2021. By contrast, last week in Nevada, a bill to adopt voting rights restoration following the end of incarceration passed the assembly with bipartisan support and is on to the state Senate. If enacted, this legislation will restore approximately 77,000 people in one fell swoop. The assembly speaker, who sponsored AB 431 , should be commended for not holding up the voting rights of approximately 77,000 American citizens who have completed the hardest part of their criminal sentences for the much more controversial voting eligibility of about 14,800 people in prison . Colorado is currently considering similar legislation . Drawing the line at restoration following release from prison is a pro-voter and completely defensible position. It is also the line drawn in the Democracy Restoration Act , a bill that has been introduced in Congress for many sessions and has now been incorporated in H.R. 1 , which the House of Representatives recently passed. Adopting restoration upon release from prison would vastly improve the laws in no fewer than 33 states, if adopted, restoring voting rights to an estimated 2 million to 3 million people. That could hardly be dismissed as minor, craven, or incremental reform. Seeking change in the near term requires advocacy based on the evidence of where popular will is currently and where it could be led. Taking stock of where 50 state legislatures and the D.C. Council are on this issue is a good gauge of popular opinion and the scope of likely reform on felon voting rights restoration. This approach would positively affect millions of people right away: people who have paid their debt and who should be given a chance to fully participate in their communities. Support our journalism

Rod Rosenstein resigns after shepherding the Mueller investigation to its completion.,slate.com,Elliot Hannon,04-29-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/rod-rosenstein-resigns-after-shepherding-the-mueller-investigation-to-its-completion.html,"Swarthmore Students Occupy Frat House After Documents Leak With Reference to “Rape Attic” Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein submitted his resignation to Monday, bringing to a close a tumultuous two years at the helm of the Mueller investigation that saw him alternatively enrage President Donald Trump and anti-Trumpers on the left. Rosenstein had been rumored to be on his way out of the Justice Department for months—and throughout the ups and downs of the special counsel investigation always seemed precarious in the job—but will officially leave his post, on his own terms, on May 11. The resignation letter reads as an affirmation of some of the achievements that Rosenstein believes have been accomplished during his tenure at the DOJ. The note also has a number of more cryptic passages that are either aimed at Trump himself or as a reminder of the principles that the Justice Department aims to embody. “I am grateful to you for the opportunity to serve; for the courtesy and humor you often display in our personal conversations; and for the goals you set in your inaugural address: patriotism, unity, safety, education, and prosperity, because ‘a nation exists to serve its citizens,’ ” Rosenstein wrote in his resignation letter . “We enforce the law without fear or favor because credible evidence is not partisan, and truth is not determined by opinion polls. We ignore fleeting distractions and focus our attention on the things that matter because a republic that endures is not governed by the news cycle. We keep the faith, we follow the rules, and we always put America first.” Rosenstein’s legacy remains unclear, but the second in command at the DOJ was in the thick of this tumultuous presidency from the outset and made what was the most consequential move of Trump’s presidency so far—the appointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel in May 2017. Rosenstein had been handed decision-making authority over the Russian investigation after then–Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself. While the appointment of Mueller to investigate Trump’s Russia ties and possible obstruction of justice angered the Trump administration, Rosenstein also tweaked the left by writing a letter critical of James Comey that was used by Trump to fire the then–FBI Ddirector in the early days of his presidency. More recently, despite managing to stay in his job long enough to see the Mueller investigation to its completion, Rosenstein sided with Attorney General Bill Barr on his handling of the release of Mueller’s findings. The roll-out has been criticized as a cover up operation for the president. Rosenstein’s successor, Jeffrey Rosen, is awaiting confirmation from the Senate."

Right Wing Smear Campaigners Try to Cook Up Fake Sexual Assault Accusations Against Pete Buttigieg,slate.com,Elliot Hannon,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/right-wing-smear-wohl-burkman-fake-sexual-assault-accusations-pete-buttigieg.html,"Trump: After Birth, Baby Is “Wrapped” in a Blanket and Mother, Doctor Decide Whether to “Execute the Baby” The Daily Beast reported Monday that noted right-wing smear campaigners Jacob Wohl and lobbyist Jack Burkman have been busy trying to cook up a controversy about Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg. The pair have reportedly been trying to recruit Republican men to make sexual assault accusations against Buttigieg, the openly gay Democratic mayor of South Bend, Ind. As with most things Wohl and Burkman touch , the scheme appears to be comically simplistic, deeply cynical, and possibly illegal. One example of the smear campaign being pushed by the two are the made up accusations posted by Michigan college student Hunter Kelly. In a Medium post Monday, a user with a Hunter Kelly profile made a vague accusation that he was “sexually assaulted by Mayor Pete Buttigieg” in February and promised “[i]n the days and weeks ahead, I will share my full story with the nation.” “That post was tweeted out by David Wohl, Jacob’s father, and quickly re-written by the site Big League Politics, which is known as a landing ground for right wing conspiracy theories,” the Daily Beast notes. Subtle. The Beast got in touch with the real Hunter Kelly who said the Medium account and the Twitter account associated with it were not his. It appears that Wohl and Burkman simply impersonated Kelly to smear the presidential candidate online. Kelly wrote a Facebook post later Monday titled: “I WAS NOT SEXUALLY ASSAULTED.” In another instance, a Republican source told the Daily Beast that Wohl and Burkman had approached him trying to get him to come forward with false allegations that Buttigieghad sexually assaulted him when he was too drunk to consent.
The pitch by Wohl and Burkman wasn’t detailed, the source said, but it resembled past attempts by the duo to peddle dubious sexual assault allegations against perceived political foes. It would involve the accuser giving a press conference where he would publicly make his accusations about Buttigieg. The source said Wohl and Burkman seemed to want him to figure out many of the details, including a window of time during which he and Buttigieg were both in Washington, when the fabricated offense may have occurred. “When the source expressed reluctance, they assured him the scheme would make him wealthy, famous, and a star in Republican politics,” the Beast reports. “Wohl cited the national recognition given to Christine Blasey Ford after she accused Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault during his confirmation hearings last year.”"

Scottish writer Ali Smith just released Spring , the third in a planned quartet of novels named for each of the seasons. The first in the series, Autumn , was released just months after Britain voted to leave the EU and was heralded as the first great post-Brexit novel. Kurt Andersen spoke with Smith in 2017 when Autumn had just been published in America . While the book feels allegorical, it’s also firmly grounded in current events. “I kind of felt I would be cheating the novel if it didn’t face the contemporary or the contemporary didn’t face it,” Smith says. The novel centers around the tender and playful cross-generational friendship between the novel’s main characters, Elizabeth and Daniel. They meet when Elizabeth is just 8 years old and intrigued by her whimsical, elderly neighbor, and the two grow close over the years through their pun-filled chats and shared love for art. There is also this remarkable third character in the book who looms over Elizabeth and Daniel’s lives: the artist Pauline Boty , who died young and until recently was forgotten to art history, but in the 1960s was a central figure in the burgeoning British pop art movement. “If there’s a spirit behind this book, it’s a spirit of Pauline Boty, who was the one and only female U.K. pop artist,” Smith explains. “She was a glorious, inventive, and experimental figure, in her art and also in the world.” 💃 See Pauline Boty's 'The Only Blonde in the World' on display at @Tate_StIves https://t.co/zf6qfnnqDl pic.twitter.com/tqWclX6rPc This podcast was produced by Studio 360’s Zoë Saunders.

FBI says it foiled army veteran's plan to bomb Nazi rally in Los Angeles.,slate.com,Molly Olmstead,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/fbi-los-angeles-nazi-rally-bomb-plot.html,"Trump: After Birth, Baby Is “Wrapped” in a Blanket and Mother, Doctor Decide Whether to “Execute the Baby” A California man has been arrested over an alleged plot to bomb a white supremacist rally in Los Angeles, law enforcement said in court documents published by the Los Angeles Times . The man was allegedly motivated by a desire to seek revenge for the mass shootings last month in two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand. Mark Steven Domingo, a 26-year-old Army veteran who recently converted to Islam, was arrested Friday night after allegedly accepting what he believed to be an improvised explosive device from a bomb maker. An undercover FBI agent posing as the bomb maker had worked with a confidential FBI source as part of a weekslong effort to uncover Domingo’s plans. The suspect had allegedly weighed several forms of retaliation for the New Zealand shootings, which left 50 people dead. He told FBI informants he wanted to cause “mass casualties” and considered attacks against Jews, police, churches, and tourists at the Santa Monica Pier, according to court documents. But he ultimately came to focus on a planned white supremacist rally in Long Beach. According to the Associated Press , no actual white supremacists showed up at the rally, which was planned for Sunday. Instead, a large group of counterprotesters rallied to demonstrate against hate. The FBI was first alerted to Domingo’s alleged plans after he posted to an unnamed platform his desire for revenge after the New Zealand attack. He told an informant who had been working with the FBI for the past six years that he considered, among other forms of terror, shooting Jews as they walked to synagogue. He also said he thought the U.S. should experience another event similar to the 2017 mass shooting in Las Vegas. “Its not about winning the civil war its about weakening America and giving them a taste of the terror they gladly spread all over the world,” he allegedly wrote . He reportedly boasted about his firearms, including two semi-automatic rifles. Domingo allegedly went as far as to purchase several hundred nails to be used as shrapnel in a pressure cooker bomb and to visit the park where the rally was to occur. But according to the court documents, he expressed some hesitation about following through with his plot. He allegedly told the confidential source he wanted to “sleep on it” but then said the next day that he wanted to go forward with the plan. Authorities have said Domingo worked alone. He has been charged with attempting to provide material support to terrorists and faces up to 15 years in prison if convicted."
"Sanders, Buttigieg, Booker, Castro 2020: Why a mayor hasn’t become president in almost 100 years.",slate.com,Henry Grabar,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/business/2019/04/mayor-president-2020-sanders-buttigieg-booker-castro.html,"Dear Care and Feeding: Can We Have Daytime Sex When Our Son’s in the House? A few weeks ago, I watched Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti give what sounded awfully close to a stump speech at a luncheon in New York. He started with the usual spiel about mayoral aptitude—bipartisanship, innovation, infrastructure, getting things done—and went on to discuss his own heritage, green jobs, climate change, immigration, the Hyperloop, pesticides, inequality, and Americans “feeling left behind.” He capped it all with a gender-neutral patriotic paraphrase of the poet Robert Browning: “A person’s reach should always exceed their grasp—or what is America for?” To which, once the rapturous applause had died down, his interlocutor responded, “You just articulated why you should be running for president.” No one is asking for another Democratic candidate for president. Still, Garcetti has long been considered the man who might finally reconcile the gap between American mayors’ high sense of self-worth and their dismal record seeking higher office. It is one of the most beguiling statistics in U.S. politics: No one with mayoral experience has become president since Calvin Coolidge, who was briefly mayor of Northampton, Massachusetts, and only two others preceded him: Grover Cleveland, who was mayor of Buffalo, New York, and Andrew Johnson, who was mayor of Greeneville, Tennessee, for two years in the 1830s. Garcetti says he’s not jumping into the 2020 primary, but his peers are: South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg is currently sitting at third in the polls. New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, former mayor of Newark, is running. So is Julián Castro, who was mayor of San Antonio before he became President Barack Obama’s secretary of housing and urban development. And former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper, who was mayor of Denver. And Sen. Bernie Sanders, who got his start in politics as mayor of Burlington, Vermont. And then there is New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, who may not be officially running yet but whose dogged, fruitless pursuit of national popularity is proof, in its own way, of mayoral tenaciousness, bravery, and idealism. At first glance, being the executive of an American city seems like a fine job from which to launch a greater political career. In reality, very few representatives, senators, or Cabinet officials have come through local politics. Why haven’t mayors broken through? Does the fact that so many are running this time around mean something’s changed? Does the fact that so many mayors are running this time around mean something’s changed? One obvious answer to the first question is that the sphere mayors operate in is largely subservient to state and federal government. Power resides with state and federal officials, who tend to take credit and deflect responsibility when it comes to urban affairs. A governor might score points for a tax cut, for example, but leave it to a mayor to figure out how to maintain after-school programs with less revenue. De Blasio, in particular, has been a victim of this dynamic, big-footed and blamed by New York’s powerful governor , Andrew Cuomo, on matters as small as animal rescue and as big as education. “Things could be worse,” President Lyndon Johnson quipped during a difficult moment in the Oval Office, “I could be a mayor.” That structure puts mayors on the outside track for higher office but, more importantly, reinforces the fact that they have little say on big issues. “Mayors have way less power than you think,” says Richard Schragger, the author of City Power . “In Charlottesville, the mayor couldn’t control guns, couldn’t take down Confederate monuments, couldn’t control the minimum wage, couldn’t adopt inclusionary housing ordinances.” In many cases, even basic local policymaking has been co-opted by statehouses dominated by conservative, anti-urban interests. Which, of course, is as much a problem for us as for mayors: America’s rural-dominated government—which gives eight senators to Wyoming, Vermont, and the Dakotas (total population 2.8 million) and two to California (population 39.6 million)—gives little thought to metropolitan issues like homelessness or public transportation. After two terms in South Bend, Buttigieg could be an example of the shortfalls of running for higher office on a mayoral record. For one thing, voters probably won’t care how a mayor picked up snow or rebuilt the waste-to-energy plant, even as reporters home in on the more controversial aspects of a tenure, like Buttigieg’s dismissal of a black police chief and his efforts to enforce building code violations in communities of color. For another, the kind of coalition building and compromise that’s required to run a city may look unattractive, particularly in the base-driven primaries, compared with candidates who have hewed to neat ideological lines in the legislature. Michael Bloomberg finally seems to have realized his moderate vibe makes him a bad fit for the Democratic electorate. And as Rudy Giuliani worked his way into the GOP mainstream, particularly during a primary run for president in 2012, he strayed so far from his centrist reputation that in 2018 he was booed at a Yankees game —a rebuke that would have been unthinkable a decade earlier. (This challenge of getting through primaries on pragmatism has also applied to governors, though their issues are more relevant during a presidential campaign.) A record of getting things done just might not be that appealing . For a third, most Americans have long associated city politics with corruption or graft, first that of the white urban machines—think the Daleys—and later that of black leaders like Detroit’s Coleman Young and Washington, D.C.’s Marion Barry. Add to that the greater crisis of disinvestment, crime, and poverty that afflicted so many U.S. cities in the second half of the 20 th century. Add to that, perhaps most importantly, the indelible association in the white mind of the American city with black power and racial conflict. Perhaps it is no surprise that for so long no one thought of city hall as a building block in a national platform. But maybe that’s changing. Mayoring is not just about picking up garbage and clearing snow anymore: Some mayors have advanced complex, progressive social agendas, like de Blasio’s success in providing prekindergarten to 70,000 kids. Others, like Garcetti, can lay claim to ambitious infrastructure initiatives—Los Angeles County is setting aside $120 billion to fund regional transportation, including highways and rail projects. Still others have led the way on issues that have newfound national resonance, like climate change, housing, and racial justice. And virtually every big-city mayor has been loud and clear about his support for immigrants and opposition to federal immigration policy, with many maintaining so-called sanctuary cities in open defiance of federal law enforcement . The reputation of the American city isn’t what it used to be. The country’s drug problem, once a symbol of urban dysfunction, is mostly white and rural now. Despite President Donald Trump’s repeated invocation of Chicago’s gun violence, urban politics is just as likely to signify class, power, and money. That’s certainly true of cities where gentrification and displacement have upended black and Latino neighborhoods and created new emblems of urbanity for public consumption. But it’s also true of places like Milwaukee, as the political scientist Katherine Cramer has shown, despite the fact that urban poverty remains endemic. Even a mayor of a depressed, post-industrial city is just as likely to be associated with condos and bike lanes as with unemployment or racial strife—or sometimes, as in Buttigieg’s case, with both. The truth is, many mayors are presiding over downtown revitalization and neighborhood poverty at the same time. But to a visitor, things look good: Auto theft is down, condos are up. Most importantly, the Democratic Party is not what it used to be: The urban-rural divide is real, and more than ever, Democratic votes are to be found in the country’s cities and suburbs. There are fewer rural Democrats than at any time in history. The party is less white than ever before. The consequences of those shifts are emerging in policy discussions—for example, in Sens. Booker, Kamala Harris, and Elizabeth Warren emphasizing housing policy, or in the expectation that all Democratic candidates will answer questions about policing. We may not get a president who ran one of the country’s cities, but at least, for a change, we’ll get to talk about them. "
Stephen Moore—Whose Fed Bid Is Crashing and Burning—Wanted to Get Rid of Child Labor Laws,slate.com,Jordan Weissmann,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/business/2019/04/stephen-moores-fed-bid-crashing-burning-joni-ernst-richard-shelby.html,"Trump Just Gave Democrats Another Reason to Launch an Impeachment Inquiry I don’t want to jinx anything, but Stephen Moore’s chances of actually making it to the Federal Reserve are starting to look a bit dicey. As journalists have continued to comb through his back catalog of magazine columns and public appearances, they’ve churned up more and more outrageous and offensive tidbits, and collectively, they seem to be eating away at his support in Congress. Just this week, the New York Times reported that at a 2016 debate about the minimum wage, he said that the U.S. should nix many of its child labor laws. (He feels it’s important that young people should get work experience early.) “I’m a radical on this,” he said, in total sincerity. “I’d get rid of a lot of these child labor laws. I want people starting to work at 11, 12.” This sentiment pops up from time to time among especially batty conservatives. Readers who are especially fond of political trivia might remember Newt Gingrich once made a similar argument during the 2012 Republican primary. (He thought kids should have the opportunity to work as janitorial assistants in public schools.) But it was not a great look then. It is still not a great look now, coming from a potential Fed nominee. (Trump previously said he intended to tap Moore for the central bank’s Board of Governors, but hasn’t officially done it yet.) Moore’s image has already taken a beating thanks to revelations that he owes the government $75,000 in back taxes and penalties, was held in contempt of court for failing to pay alimony, and spent years as a pundit writing sexist dribble that he has since tried to defend as comedy. (He mocked women’s sports, criticized the idea of women serving in the military, downplayed the seriousness of women being sexually harassed by drunk frat guys on college campuses, and—while married—joked about his kid foiling efforts to pick up younger women, among other bits.) And many Republicans on the Hill seem to be getting tired of it. “His past writings are ridiculous,” Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst told reporters on Monday. “I’m not enthused about supporting him, let’s put it that way.” Richard Shelby, the powerful GOP senator from Alabama, is also making skeptical noises. Via Politico :
Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) said he thought Moore would be an interesting pick for the Fed but added that he too has qualms about what he has said about women.
“I think everybody does,” he told reporters. “My wife is a professor, you know? She broke through a lot of ceilings and everything,” adding that he has a granddaughter who “thinks she can do anything.”
“I know him, but a lot of these things have come up about his taxes, about his child support and alimony, about things he’s written about women,” he said. He said those things would all be considered if he’s nominated. Shelby is a senior member of the Banking Committee, which would have jurisdiction over Moore’s nomination. And remember, Mitt Romney has already hinted that he has qualms with Moore’s qualifications. (The man spent much of his life as conservative political advocate and pundit, co-founding the Club for Growth and writing editorials for the Wall Street Journal; he also lacks an actual economics Ph.D.) Point being, things aren’t looking great for ol’ Steve. In related news, the White House has finally started going through Moore’s past writing, looking for any other bombs. Better late than never? Update, April 30, 2019, 2:12 PM: Moore may be in even deeper trouble than I thought. About 10 minutes after I published this post, Politico posted an article with more cautious and critical comments from Republicans. “These stories that have come out recently will be a good test about what the support level is up here,” said Senate Majority Whip John Thune, which sounds like a hint that Moore’s chances may be on the verge of an imminent collapse. “If you have Joni [Ernst] and other members of our conference … as affected by some of these stories as she was, we’ll get a sense of that pretty quickly.” An anonymous Republican senator was more blunt: “I don’t imagine he can get the votes.” Update, April 30, 2019, 2:50 PM: Yeah, it looks like this ship has hit an iceberg. BREAKING: GOP Sen. Joni Ernst is the first to go on record against Steve Moore.She says it is “very unlikely” she would support Moore and that she has told the White House that. #Fed"
Venezuela: Opposition leader says armed forces are joining him.,slate.com,Joshua Keating,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/venezuela-guaido-maduro-coup.html,"Why So Many Black and Female Voters Seem to Be Buying What Biden Is Selling It’s all or nothing for Juan Guaidó now. Venezuela has been in an agonizing stalemate since January, when the opposition leader and president of the national assembly declared himself interim president of the country and was quickly recognized as such by the United States and the majority of governments in the region. President Nicolás Maduro, who remains in control of the country’s government and armed forces, has refused to budge. Meanwhile, crippling international sanctions have worsened the already dire economic conditions in what was once one of Latin America’s richest nations, now plagued by food and medicine shortages, widespread blackouts, and an ever-worsening refugee crisis. On Tuesday morning, Guaidó threw down a gauntlet by releasing a video from an air force base near the capital, Caracas, surrounded by armed military forces. Guaidó said that the “main military units of the Armed Forces” were backing what he called the final phase of “Operation Liberty.” He also appeared with imprisoned opposition leader Leopoldo López, who said he’d been freed by military guards loyal to Guaidó. Gunfire between pro-Guaidó and pro-Maduro troops was reported at the air base following Guaidó’s announcement. #OperacionLibertad was quickly backed on Twitter by U.S. officials including Vice President Mike Pence, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, national security adviser John Bolton, and Sen. Marco Rubio. Regional governments including Colombia and Brazil also voiced their support. Guaidó has been calling for the armed forces to back him from the beginning, but Tuesday’s actions are a significant escalation, the apparent beginning of an attempted military coup, though not everyone wants to call it that. Rubio, describing Guaidó as the internationally recognized legitimate president, has called CNN’s reporting “grotesque” and “shameful” for describing Tuesday’s events as an “armed coup.” He protests a bit too much: Calling something a coup is not a value judgment. Brutal dictators can be overthrown by their own militaries—just look at recent events in Sudan—and there are plenty of examples of militaries acting in coordination with peaceful protesters and even working to restore democracy . The bigger reason to be hesitant about calling Tuesday’s events a coup is that it’s not clear an overthrow is actually happening. The fighting at the air base fizzled out quickly, and while there have been demonstrations and violent clashes between protesters and security forces throughout Caracas, Reuters reports that “several hours after Guaidó’s announcement there was no sign of any other military activity and there were no immediate reports of casualties.” Maduro has tweeted that regional defense commanders have “expressed their total loyalty,” and until we see otherwise, the assumption should be that the bulk of the military is still backing the government. Still, if a small but significant part of the armed forces has defected to Maduro, it could raise the stakes of the standoff significantly: While the Maduro government has arrested hundreds of opponents in recent weeks, it hasn’t touched Guaidó himself, recognizing the risks of detaining the man whom many world governments recognize as the legitimate president of Venezuela. Bolton has promised a “significant response” if Guaidó is touched. Tuesday’s actions will raise pressure on the regime to take action to finally stop Guaidó, and raise pressure on his international backers to take action—peaceful or otherwise—on his behalf. Today may not be the final battle for control of Venezuela, but the odds just went up significantly that Guaidó will end up dead, in jail, or sitting in the presidential palace.

"Despite William Barr’s objections, it’s normal for Congress’ staff to question witnesses.",slate.com,W. Neil Eggleston,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/william-barr-testimony-house-judiciary-committee-iran-contra-history.html,"Trump Just Gave Democrats Another Reason to Launch an Impeachment Inquiry As William Barr and the House Judiciary Committee have continued to spar over whether or not—and on what terms—the attorney general might appear in front of the committee later this week, I have been reminded of the congressional hearings that took place in the summer of 1987 regarding the Iran-Contra affair. At the time, I was deputy chief counsel of the House Select Committee to Investigate Covert Arms Transactions With Iran. Rep. Lee Hamilton, a Democrat, was the chairman of the House committee, and John Nields was chief counsel. Sen. Daniel Inouye was chairman of the parallel Senate committee, and Arthur Liman was chief counsel. The hearings performed both an oversight and a public education function as the country was struggling to understand what had happened within the administration regarding the secret sale of U.S. military missiles to Iran and the diversion of the proceeds to the Contra rebels in Nicaragua. Although separate committees, the panels held the hearings jointly. Both senators and members of Congress attended the hearings and asked questions of the witnesses. It was essentially a joint investigation. In the summer of 1987, it was also riveting television. In the current case, the House Judiciary Committee has reported that Barr is threatening not to show up to scheduled testimony about the Mueller report on Thursday because the committee proposes to allow staff attorneys to question the attorney general. This allowance is in line with historical precedent, as I know well from my time working on the Iran-Contra hearings as a staff member who questioned top administration officials on behalf of the committee. Indeed, during the Iran-Contra hearings more than 30 years ago, I do not recall any administration witnesses refusing to testify at the hearing, except for Lt. Col. Oliver North and Adm. John Poindexter, who would not testify without immunity. The committees granted them immunity; they were later indicted and convicted at trial; and their convictions were overturned on appeal because of the immunity grant. I do not recall any limitations on the questions we were entitled to ask any witnesses, including administration witness, except that classified matters were addressed in closed testimony. Similarly, I do not recall the administration witnesses refusing to answer any questions. I do not recall any real or sustained objection to the decision to have committee lawyers conduct the questioning. Of particular relevance to the current dispute between the attorney general and the House Judiciary Committee, witnesses who testified at the hearings were first questioned on television and in open hearings not just by the members of Congress but by lawyers on the committees’ staff. As I recall, the House and Senate committees divided the witnesses over which committees’ staff would be the first questioner. If the Senate lawyer was the first questioner, the House lawyer would take a turn at the conclusion of the Senate lawyer’s questioning. Only then did the senators and members of the House begin their questioning. There was no serious outside challenge of whether committee lawyers would conduct the questioning or members of Congress would perform that role: Both did. This practice applied to all witnesses, including the Cabinet secretaries and other senior administration officials who testified. Caspar Weinberger, who was secretary of defense, was later indicted for his testimony; he was pardoned by President George H.W. Bush. Attorney General Edwin Meese also testified at the hearings without limitation. The committees believed that the oversight and public education functions of the hearings would be better met by initial uninterrupted questioning by committee counsel. The committees also believed that it was entirely under its discretion to determine the best method of conducting the hearings. Again, I do not recall any real or sustained objection to the decision to have committee lawyers conduct the questioning. The committee lawyers did not take the place of the members of the two committees, each of whom also had the opportunity to ask questions of the witnesses. Rather, the staff lawyer questioning permitted the foundation to be laid so that the member questions were more effective and more focused on the policy issues that the committee was exploring. The process the committees chose worked. The role of a committee lawyer questioner at the Iran-Contra hearings was not my only exposure to the practice of having counsel conduct questioning in congressional hearings. In the 1990s, I was an associate counsel in President Bill Clinton’s White House counsel’s office. I was called to testify before the Senate Whitewater Committee, an examination that also took place in an open hearing and on television. The initial questioning was done by Michael Chertoff, who was lead counsel to the committee. At the time, Republicans controlled the Senate, and Sen. Al D’Amato was the chairman. A number of Clinton administration witness were called to testify before that committee and, to my memory, were all questioned first by committee counsel. I don’t remember any objection from the Clinton White House to that process. What I vividly remember is that it was significantly more fun being the questioner than the witness.

"Warriors, Rockets complain too much.",slate.com,Ben Mathis-Lilley,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/warriors-rockets-complain-too-much.html,"The Spurs Forgot How Fouling, Time, and Points Work On Sunday, the Golden State Warriors and Houston Rockets took part in what was ostensibly an NBA playoff game—the first of their Western Conference semifinals series—in Oakland, California. More than a matchup of professional basketball clubs, though, the Warriors’ 104–100 victory was a prelude to a postgame gripe session that looks set to continue into Tuesday night’s Game 2 and beyond. The bitching and moaning started on the court, crescendoing after this crucial play, in which the Rockets felt James Harden got fouled by the Warriors’ Draymond Green: CP3 got ejected after this wild Rockets final possession 😮 pic.twitter.com/qXqGJ9Yqjo — SportsCenter (@SportsCenter) April 28, 2019 Defenders are prohibited from moving into the “ landing area ” of a player taking a shot. The NBA’s VP of refereeing would later admit that, earlier in the game, the Warriors’ Klay Thompson should’ve been whistled for undercutting Harden’s ability to land. But on this play, it looked like Harden kicked his feet forward unnaturally in an effort to draw contact; ESPN’s Scott Van Pelt has compiled video evidence demonstrating that Harden tends to make this kicking motion when there’s a defender in front of him but not when he’s wide open and shooting normally. While the NBA’s rule book doesn’t set precise dimensions for what constitutes a landing area, the league said in a postgame statement that referees had been correct not to call a foul given that Harden had only drawn contact by extending his legs. As you can see, Harden’s teammate Chris Paul was so upset by the sequence beginning with Harden’s shot that he got ejected and has since been fined $35,000 for “ recklessly making contact with a game official .” After the game, Harden—who shoots far more free throws than anyone in the league—complained that he wasn’t being given a “ fair chance ” by referees. And then it emerged that the Rockets had been so mad about the officiating in their Western Conference Finals loss to the Warriors last year that they’d prepared an entire report about it , one that argued that refereeing bias—rather than the 27 straight 3-point attempts they missed during Game 7—was responsible for their defeat. Which is all very tedious, coming from a team whose offensive strategy is largely predicated on exploiting the gray area between drawing fouls and flopping . Live by the sword, die by the sword, Daryl Morey! Does this mean we should all root for the Warriors instead ? Hardly! Golden State is also insistent, and has been for years , that NBA referees are biased against them . The paranoia manifests itself not just in comments to the press but in near-constant in-game complaining: This season Green and teammate Kevin Durant tied for the league lead in technical fouls with 16, while now-injured Warrior DeMarcus Cousins got 7 despite only playing in 30 games. (Efficient!) Last season, Green and Durant were second and third on the same list, and they’ve already gotten three techs each in this year’s playoffs. Durant has also recently complained that the media isn’t fair to him , while Green was suspended by the Warriors earlier in the season after reportedly calling Durant a “bitch” in a locker-room tirade . It’s truly a tangled web of techs and suspensions that the Warriors weave—an atmosphere of bickering made all the more bizarre by the fact that they are a team of All-Stars who win almost all their games. The hedonic treadmill is real. So, we have two of the league’s most popular and heavily promoted teams, each believing in a theory of persecution that’s supported by neither common sense nor statistical evidence , each more than willing to complain to anyone at any time about this and other subjects. The once-lovable favorites are drowning in a bitter marinade of whining and infighting, while the underdogs have snatched unlikability from the jaws of, uh, rootableness. Also, the teams’ game Tuesday night will be refereed by an official who was voted worst in the league in an anonymous poll of NBA players, and who both Harden and Paul have criticized publicly as recently as February. I’ll be pulling for the asteroid!"
Wonder What Wellness Branding Looks Like in Your Mouth? Kendall Jenner’s “Moon Oral Care” Is Here.,slate.com,Rachelle Hampton,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/human-interest/2019/04/kendall-jenners-moon-oral-care-is-wellness-culture-in-your-mouth.html,"A “Nice” Guy Suddenly Said Awful Things to Me During Sex. Is This Normal? The Kardashian-Jenner empire is once again expanding. And for the first time, Kendall Jenner—previously the only sister without her own beauty brand—is getting involved in the industry conquests. In an Instagram post last Wednesday , the model and now entrepreneur announced she was excited to help launch Moon Oral Care (with the company’s founder, Shaun Neff). It is, rather obviously, a dental care line that is founded on the noble belief that “taking care of your teeth shouldn’t just do something — it should make you feel something.” What exactly that something is isn’t entirely clear. Perhaps that wonderful, tingly feeling of disrupting your periodontitis in full view of all your followers? It was only a matter of time before Jenner launched a product of her own, but with lip kits , perfume , jeans , and whatever Poosh is already staked out by her sisters, it was up in the air as to what region of the body she’d claim as hers to beautify. And with notable branded gaffes like that poorly thought out Pepsi commercial and Fyre Fest in her past, it’s safe to say that whatever Jenner launched needed to be relatively non-controversial. Hello, teeth . Along with acting as the brand’s face, Jenner also has a stake in Moon Oral Care’s business. The line includes Instagram-bait dental innovations like matte black toothbrushes, activated charcoal whitening toothpaste in “lunar peppermint,” and a special Kendall Jenner tooth-whitening pen, all in sleek packaging that will look at home next to your Sunday Riley serums and Glossier Cloud Paint. The entire line, which only includes natural, vegan, and PETA-certified ingredients, is already available on Moon Oral Care’s website and will be in ULTA stores starting in May. Jenner’s dental care line didn’t strike me at first as being at home with the rest of her family’s business ventures. Sure, charcoal toothpaste had its Instagram moment , and you can’t really ride the New York City subway without seeing a Quip toothbrush ad , but thus far Kardashian-Jenner-branded ventures have largely stayed within the lucrative realm of traditional beauty products that outlast a single trend cycle. When I think of the things that influencers are most likely to try to keep selling me, floss—jet-black packaging notwithstanding—isn’t really at the top of the list. But the fact that a member of one of the most business-savvy families in America has decided to stake a claim not in the relatively obvious, safe realms of makeup or clothes, but in something beauty-adjacent but also kind of gross like dental care, signals just what a behemoth the $4.2 trillion wellness industry has become. Moon Oral Care is one of many product lines that fit into the subtle cultural shift toward expensive beauty care that is marketed as “natural.” Rather than covering up flaws or (supposedly) turning back the clock with mysterious anti-aging compounds, these products perfect or brighten or whiten and only with the “best ingredients.” This evolution is at the heart of no-makeup makeup and the ongoing rise of frou-frou skin care, as well as the turn away from framing weight loss as a quest to well, lose weight. Instead, we are in pursuit of feeling stronger or cleansing our bodies of toxins, hiding our mothers’ diet culture in the new language of luxurious empowerment, of freedom from chemicals in a world where pollutants are slowly killing us and our planet. Indeed, Moon Oral Care promises a “routine worthy of your countertop,” an all-natural treat to yourself that you deserve, leagues above the unworthy drugstore toothpaste. And like so much wellness, it lies at the intersection of murky science and chic packaging. As a recent Atlantic piece by Ferris Jabr detailed , the evidence behind most dental procedures and interventions is tenuous at best. Because of the way that dentistry evolved, isolated from other more rigorously researched bodies of medicine, many of the truisms we hear about how best to take care of our teeth are little more than maxims passed down through the ages, internalized as truth. “As a profession, dentistry has not yet applied the same level of self-scrutiny as medicine, or embraced as sweeping an emphasis on scientific evidence,” Jabr writes. And yet, like skincare, dental care is designed to protect and perfect one of the very first things that others see when they interact with you. The lack of evidence behind treatments and products, combined with the fact that having bad skin and teeth can have a negative effect not just on self-esteem but on how others perceive you , creates a bevy of vulnerable underinformed consumers. In other words, a perfect market to corner in a larger industry that is designed to make you feel bad about yourself while simultaneously producing a solution to your woes. Of course, none of that makes Moon Oral Care uniquely devious. By all means, it’s probably as effective as any other dental product on the market, and it’s certainly prettier. But Jenner’s business-savvy step into both dental care and the marketing of “natural” ingredients as automatically superior to their “chemical” cousins suggests to me that we are only just beginning our journey toward the wellness-ification of everything. At the very least, it means that, served alongside with Instagram ads for dermabrasion or cycling classes, I can soon expect to see smiling influencers with charcoal-stained teeth."
10 Questions Raised by the Sonic the Hedgehog Trailer,slate.com,Natalia Winkelman,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/sonic-hedgehog-trailer-questions-teeth-robotnik.html,"What’s It Like to Almost Beat Jeopardy ’s Game-Changing Champion? There’s been plenty of confusion surrounding the live-action Sonic the Hedgehog movie ever since its announcement, and the movie’s new trailer leaves us in an even murkier cloud of supersonic dust. Here are several of our most pressing questions. Is Sonic … an alien? Some of us thought he was just a normal anthropomorphic sneaker-wearing hedgehog. Is he a hedgehog, an alien, or a hedgehog alien? Are we going to have to brush up on our Sonic canon? Why is this trailer scored to “Gangsta’s Paradise”? Whether Sonic is a hedgehog, an alien, or a hedgehog alien, Coolio’s meditation on the cycle of violence in poor American communities still seems like a confusing music choice, at best. What happened to James Marsden’s career? This is a long way from playing an X-Man. And Jim Carrey’s? Has he been spending too much time painting ? If Sonic is from another planet, why does he speak English like Jean-Ralphio ? Are his language-learning skills as speedy as his feet? And what’s with his body ratio? He looks more like a very small man in a royal-blue gorilla suit than our classic long-legged ball of barbs. Even Sonic creator Yuji Naka wasn’t convinced by initial images, taking to Twitter to call out the creature’s humanlike torso. And his bare hands? Naka also noted the lack of handwear . Is this an origin story about how Sonic got his gloves? And those pearly whites?! While hedgehogs, in real life, do have teeth (Earth hedgehogs, anyway), Sonic typically does not. The trailer’s shot of his full set of choppers is, frankly, terrifying. Get Slate Culture in Your Inbox We encountered an issue signing you up. Please try again.

Are Sonic’s fox and *Googles* echidna friends still on their own … planet? Are they waiting until the second trailer to see whether this movie can justify its existence? Maybe we’d stay away, too."
The confirmation class that protested Methodist LGBTQ politics reveals the huge split within the church.,slate.com,Ruth Graham,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/human-interest/2019/04/methodist-church-lgbtq-policy-middle-school-protest.html,"What Happens When You No Longer Want to Be the Man You Were Raised to Become? Something unusual happened one recent Sunday morning at First United Methodist Church in Omaha, Nebraska. It was the Sunday after Easter, and a group of eight middle school students had spent the past school year in confirmation class together, preparing to become formal members of their church. Their confirmation service was set to take place that day. But this year, the class made other plans: Together, the students wrote a statement rejecting their membership as an act of resistance. Two class members read it in front of the church. “While we love our congregation,” they said, as their parents and other members watched from the pews, “we believe the United Methodist policies on LGBTQ+ clergy and same-sex marriage are immoral.” A clip from the presentation went viral on Monday, as evidence that “this generation will save us all”: In case you needed a reason to believe that this generation will save us all, here it is. The entire confirmation class at First United Methodist Omaha decided not to join at this time in protest of the UMC’s anti lgbtq+ policies. 🌈❤️ pic.twitter.com/mDjwMTu9ZJ — Sheri Shuler (@SheriShuler) April 28, 2019 It was pretty clear from that snippet that the congregation didn’t recoil in outrage at the youth protest; a smattering of applause can be heard in the last few seconds. But the clip didn’t capture the completeness of the church’s support for the act of defiance. According to Kent Little, FUMC’s lead pastor, the class received a standing ovation. Then the church offered a blessing for each child, “affirming their decision and affirming their faith,” followed by a celebratory lasagna dinner. Little said that he has only had one or two young people in 27 years decide to opt out of church membership after going through the confirmation class. “To have them band together and say ‘No,’ that’s not a small thing,” he said. “We adults could learn something from that.” This is a strange, sad time in many United Methodist Church congregations across the United States. At a large church conference in February, delegates voted to strengthen the denomination’s opposition to gay clergy and to same-sex marriage. Unlike many mainline denominations, the United Methodist Church has never formally welcomed gay clergy or sanctioned same-sex marriages. But in practice, the denomination offered individual congregations wide latitude in recent years. The triumph of the “traditional plan”—the name given to the proposal to crack down on queer clergy and same-sex marriage ceremonies in the church—changes that, threatening violators with suspension and defrocking. Last week, a Methodist court upheld the substance of the changes , which go into effect in January 2020. This is a strange, sad time in many United Methodist Church congregations across the United States. The “traditional plan” raises the possibility that the country’s largest mainline Protestant denomination will fracture over an issue about which it had long tolerated a measure of disagreement. The American branch of the denomination is not clearly liberal or conservative: Elizabeth Warren, George W. Bush, and Jeff Sessions are all Methodists. The overwhelmingly white American church is also shrinking. The vote in February signified the gathering strength of the denomination outside the United States; the “traditional plan” was backed by a coalition from the Philippines, countries from Africa, and other countries where a socially conservative version of Methodism is growing. American evangelical Methodists supported the plan too. Like many progressive Methodist churches, Little’s congregation is now figuring out whether its future lies outside of the denomination. FUMC is a large church, and it has a history of activism going back to the 19 th century. Its leaders like to tell stories about the time the congregation apparently refused to pay a pro-slavery pastor the denomination assigned to it in 1858, and about its support of the Native American civil rights leader Standing Bear a few decades later. In 1997, the church’s senior pastor, Jimmy Creech, performed a “covenant service” for two women; in 1999, he did the same for two men, and was defrocked by the denomination . The next year, the church joined a network of “reconciling” Methodist churches that advocates for the full inclusion of LGBTQ people into the denomination. In that context, the 2019 FUMC confirmation class’s decision to protest its denomination’s rightward shift is not a rejection of its own church, but an affirmation of what it’s learned from it. The church has a youth group specifically for queer young people, and it is hosting its annual “Pride Prom” in a few weeks. In its statement, the class cites the church as the source of the students’ convictions: “There are many things we have grown up appreciating about FUMC Omaha,” they wrote. “We have always known that gay families were just like any other families, [and] we are surrounded by peers with all gender identities … We appreciate that we have never thought anything was strange about women pastors. We have fond memories of singing in the children’s choir and watching the kites on Easter morning.” Little said the class started working on this statement after the church conference in February. The students’ teacher, Tim Fickenscher, told Religion News Service that the idea started with two girls in the class, and he gave others in the class wide latitude to come to different conclusions. By the time Little met individually with each student, the customary conclusion to the confirmation class, all eight had decided they could not in good conscience join the church. The class says in the letter that it will delay confirmations until it sees how FUMC responds to the “traditional plan.” In early April, the church council voted to withhold the remainder of the 2019 payments it would usually make to the denomination while it decides how to move forward. It also voted to continue hosting same-sex weddings and encouraging the clergy to officiate, in defiance of the denomination. The next step is to hold a series of small group meetings to start determining which path the congregation as a whole prefers. It could stay in the denomination and continue the struggle; disaffiliate and join another denomination, like the United Church of Christ; or become an independent church. “Those of us who want change and full inclusion, can we create something new? And how long do we wait for that to happen?” Little asked. “For a lot of people, the UMC is our home. How do you walk away from that?”"
Trump’s “execute the baby” lie has a dangerously effective history.,slate.com,Rebecca Onion,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/trump-execute-baby-propaganda-history.html,"Why So Many Black and Female Voters Seem to Be Buying What Biden Is Selling On Saturday, at a rally in Green Bay, Wisconsin, Donald Trump repeated his absurd claim that pro-choice women and doctors are “executing” newborns and therefore must be stopped by stricter laws. The most recent version of Trump’s ginned-up nightmare , which the president has taken to conjuring on the campaign trail this year, referenced a bill advanced by state Republicans that would make doctors liable if they withhold medical care from a fetus that had survived an abortion attempt. Because doctors would already provide that care in such an (extremely unlikely) event, the Democratic governor has promised to veto it. But Trump’s fantasy brooks no facts: “The baby is born,” he declared. “The mother meets with the doctor. They take care of the baby. They wrap the baby beautifully. And then the doctor and the mother determine whether or not they will execute the baby.” (Cue righteous boos from the audience.) How can the reality-based community, where it is understood that mother-doctor infanticide conspiracies are not real, even respond to a story like this? One response is: Tell the truth about the difficult circumstances around nonviable pregnancies. This time around, a former NICU nurse wrote a viral Twitter thread about what happens in a hospital after the birth of a baby too disabled to live. The last time Trump told this crazy story, in February, while discussing recent New York state legislation to expand abortion rights past the 24 th week in cases where the fetus isn’t viable or the mother’s life is threatened, OB-GYN and writer Jen Gunter described her own experience giving birth to a “son who was born to die” in a New York Times op-ed, titled “ I Didn’t Kill My Baby .” But none of these earnest and well-meant counternarratives are going to change the minds of people who already believe that women and doctors might actually do something like this. That’s because the story is much more than “bullshit,” a “lie,” or a “falsehood.” Trump’s abortion story is a piece of atrocity propaganda. It draws on a centuries-old trope—the cruel and capricious murder of infants—to confirm his supporters’ beliefs that the liberals and feminists living among them are, secretly, selfish monsters. And for those who’ve deployed it in the past, it has proved dangerously effective. This is why, out of all the terrifying crap that comes out of his mouth, I think it might be the scariest. Here’s the history Trump is tapping. The most durable murdered-babies lie ever is the blood libel. Anti-Semitic accusations of Jewish ritual murder of children have fueled pogroms since at least the 12 th century. (The Holocaust Encyclopedia finds mention of such charges against Jews as far back as the second century B.C.) Over the years, this idea that Jews kill children for their blood has found purchase in writings by people as integral to the “Western tradition” as Geoffrey Chaucer and Martin Luther. The Nazis made extensive use of the theme. In 1939, the cover of the anti-Semitic newspaper Der Stürmer featured a medieval depiction of a group of Jewish adults draining blood from a toddler while the bodies of five already-murdered children lie at their feet. Nor are such blood libels a relic of the past. As Talia Lavin has observed , the manifesto allegedly written by last weekend’s synagogue shooter contained a reference to Simon of Trent, a 2-year-old Christian boy who died in Italy in 1475 and whose death was used as pretext for a wave of anti-Semitic violence. Even as Jews have borne the brunt of the baby-killing myth, propagandists for other causes have used it to their advantage. After the Irish Rebellion of 1641, in which Irish Catholics attacked Protestant settlers, depositions of witnesses to the events were published in London, shifting the tide of British opinion against the Irish . The witnesses often mentioned hearing of—but never seeing —Irish Catholics ripping open pregnant women, pulling out their babies, and beating them to death against rocks. In 1782, Benjamin Franklin, of all people, put together a counterfeit newspaper with an article supposedly describing atrocities committed by the Seneca Indians against colonial frontier families at the behest of the British government. (By telling this story, Franklin wanted to turn the British public against their government and give the new United States purchase at the peace negotiations that were ongoing at the time.) In this grisly fiction, a Seneca representative mailed a British agent a bunch of scalps of American frontier families, including scalps of boys and girls, as well as “29 little infant Scalps of various sizes; … a little black Knife in the middle to shew they were ript out of their Mothers’ Bellies.” Anti-German propaganda during World War I was full of violently murdered babies. After the war, Arthur Ponsonby, a liberal member of Parliament interested in exposing the way such propaganda helped shape the public’s will to fight, published a report called “ Falsehood in War-Time ”(1929), which included a chapter titled “The Belgian Baby Without Hands.” In it, Ponsonby collected the many times that this story—that German soldiers invading Belgium had cut off babies’ and children’s hands and arms, often leaving them alive to serve as warnings to the populace—appeared in French, British, American, and Italian newspapers. In France, Ponsonby found, newspapers even embellished the story by “depicting German soldiers eating the hands.” The story of the handless baby or child traveled even further than the other tales of babies impaled on bayonets or nailed to doors, despite the fact that it seemed physically improbable that any child could survive such mutilation. “Everybody wanted to believe the story,” Ponsonby writes, “and many went so far as to say they had seen the baby.” Despite the modicum of caution Americans and British people felt toward anti-German propaganda after the baroque excesses of the run-up to the First World War, 1940s Americans were much more comfortable consuming propaganda that demonized the Japanese. And so the baby killers migrated east. Historian John Dower notes that, in an American propaganda film made during World War II , actors playing Japanese soldiers tossed Chinese babies onto bayonets. The baby-killing fable still works to foment war. Most recently, in the run-up to the Gulf War, the American PR firm Hill & Knowlton, hired by the Kuwaiti government in exile, helped spread a dubiously sourced atrocity story about Iraqi soldiers ripping premature babies from incubators in a hospital so that they could carry off the machines, then leaving the infants on the floor to die. The story really went early-1990s viral when the daughter of Kuwait’s ambassador to the United States gave “testimony” about the incident, which she at first claimed to have witnessed (and later said she’d heard about from others), in front of a congressional committee. But here we have a president (who, always remember, probably doesn’t actually care whether anyone has an abortion) spreading baby-killing propaganda against his own people. In so doing, he’s contributing to what scholar Carol Mason calls “the apocalyptic narrative of pro-life politics. ” Mason surveys books, pamphlets, speeches, and ephemera produced by and for anti-abortion activists between the 1960s and 2000s, and shows how they depicted the abortion debate as an epic battleground between good and evil. Through these stories, Mason writes, pro-life Christians came to see themselves as “a chosen minority facing a satanic majority hell-bent on providing abortions.” Trump’s story, clumsy though it may sound to the uninitiated, fits right into this cosmology. In 1984, sociologist Kristin Luker observed , after interviewing activists on either side of the abortion debate, that large amounts of “surprise, outrage, and vindictiveness” occur within conversations on this issue because it calls people’s “world views” into question—those ideals that are so deep inside us that we don’t even know how to name them. “Denying that one’s opponents are decent, honorable people is one way of distancing oneself from the unsettling thought that there could be legitimate differences of opinion on one’s most cherished beliefs,” Luker wrote. For the anti-choice activists Luker interviewed, the possibility of choosing abortion strikes at the heart of their understanding of women’s purpose: to become mothers. That’s why the detail of the blanket in Trump’s story—“They wrap the baby beautifully”—sticks in the mind, as it’s meant to do. These baby-killing liberals, this story telegraphs to Trump’s base, are coldblooded and unnatural, offering care one minute and turning on their infants in the next. Possibly, the story says first, they aren’t even women. Possibly, it implies next, they aren’t even human."
Trump just gave Democrats another reason to launch an impeachment inquiry.,slate.com,Mark Joseph Stern,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/trump-democrats-impeachment-house-subpoena-deutsche-bank-lawsuit.html,"William Barr’s Testimony Implies That Robert Mueller Should Say Whether Trump Committed a Crime President Donald Trump keeps giving the House of Representatives excellent reasons to begin an official impeachment inquiry. The latest came on Monday when Trump and some members of his family filed a lawsuit to quash subpoenas asking Deutsche Bank and Capitol One to turn over financial records concerning the Trumps and their business. The president argues that House Democrats issued the subpoenas for illegitimate reasons unconnected to any formal business of Congress. This argument is quite weak under Supreme Court precedent , since Congress has broad constitutional authority to conduct investigations. But if Democrats are worried about making the case in court that their subpoenas are tethered to a legitimate congressional function, they have a simple solution at hand: Admit that these subpoenas may serve as a prelude to impeachment. No one seriously questions Congress’ power to issue subpoenas as part of its oversight duties. But Trump’s lawyers insist that these subpoenas, which have not yet been released to the public, go too far. They were, Monday’s lawsuit alleges, “issued to harass” the president, “to rummage through every aspect of his personal finances” to locate “material that might be used to cause him political damage.” Because “no grounds exist to establish any purpose other than a political one,” the suit claims, the federal courts must prohibit the banks from complying with the subpoenas. This analysis might be compelling from a partisan perspective. But from a legal standpoint, it is highly dubious. In 1975’s Eastland v. United States Servicemen’s Fund , the Supreme Court ruled that the Constitution’s Speech or Debate Clause generally bars courts from interfering with congressional subpoenas. The court explained that as long as Congress is operating within the “sphere of legitimate legislative activity” or “with respect to other matters which the Constitution places within the jurisdiction of either House,” the judiciary is flatly forbidden from impeding its subpoena power. Trump’s lawyers insist that Democrats’ subpoenas breach this sphere, writing that “investigations are legitimate only insofar as they promote some legitimate legislative purpose.” And because “there is no possible legislation at the end of this tunnel,” the subpoenas fall outside the House’s constitutional authority and must be quashed. This reading of Eastland is, at best, creative: The Supreme Court did not limit the “legitimate legislative sphere” to the deliberation of legislation alone. Instead, citing an earlier case , it asked whether the subpoenas were part of the “deliberative and communicative processes … with respect to the consideration and passage or rejection of proposed legislation or with respect to other matters which the Constitution places within the jurisdiction of either House.” Note that the court did not require Congress to justify its subpoenas by pointing to some proposed legislation that an investigation might further. Rather, the court explained that “the power to investigate is inherent in the power to make laws” and that the “issuance of subpoenas” has “long been held to be a legitimate use by Congress of its power to investigate.” In other words, Congress’ paramount constitutional duty is to “make laws.” To legislate, Congress must investigate; to investigate, Congress must issue subpoenas. And courts may not second-guess a congressional committee’s decision that an otherwise lawful subpoena may aid future legislation. Under constitutional text and Supreme Court precedent, then, Trump’s lawsuit should fail. The current Supreme Court, however, has not proved especially respectful of precedent. It also seems eager to shield this administration from scrutiny and aggrandize Trump’s powers . So, it certainly wouldn’t hurt if the House had a backup argument—one that relied not only on precedent linking investigations to legislation, but that explained how these subpoenas directly assist the House exercise “matters which the Constitution places within the jurisdiction of either House.” That’s where impeachment comes into play. There is a possibility—not huge, but not trivial—that conservative judges could interfere with these subpoenas by asserting that they are too detached from actual legislation to constitute “legitimate legislative” actions. But Congress does not only have the power to make laws; it also has the power to impeach the president. It shares that authority with no other body; the decision to impeach the president is the House’s alone. And as ThinkProgress’ Ian Millhiser has noted , the House’s power to investigate the president’s potential “high crimes and misdemeanors” is inherent in its authority to impeach him. Congress members need to inspect the president’s alleged crimes to determine whether impeachment is an appropriate remedy. Under constitutional text and Supreme Court precedent, then, Trump’s lawsuit should fail. If Trump’s lawsuit winds up before a court that appears hostile to the subpoenas, the House should be prepared to explain why its investigation is necessary to promote all of its legitimate congressional interests. Not just hypothetical legislation, but in other core constitutional powers. Congress already knows that Trump may have accepted payments from foreign governments in violation of the Constitution . It also knows that he obstructed justice in an effort to impede special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation—which, among other things, reportedly inspected Trump’s financial records. Congress thus has an excellent reason to subpoena bank records of Trump, his business, and his family, seeking proof of misconduct grave enough to trigger impeachment proceedings. Any court that hampered the House’s ability to obtain those materials by exercising its subpoena powers would act in clear contravention of the Constitution. Even in our increasingly Trump-friendly judiciary, it is difficult to imagine judges so blatantly interfering with the congressional process. Democrats should admit what everyone already knows: These subpoenas may undergird eventual articles of impeachment. There is nothing shameful about that, and no reason to keep it a secret. To the contrary, it’s a smart strategy to fend off Trump’s legal challenge and remind courts that the House is operating squarely within its constitutional prerogatives. Support our journalism

Here’s the perfect big economic policy idea for Pete Buttigieg.,slate.com,Jordan Weissmann,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/business/2019/04/pete-buttigieg-economic-policy-warren-sanders-2020.html,"Here’s Why the Dothraki Attack in Game of Thrones Was So Devastating Pete Buttigieg sometimes gets criticized for not talking enough about public policy, which I think is a bit unfair. Early on, the precocious mayor of South Bend made it clear that his first priority as president would be a series of small d-democratic reforms that might also happen to help the big D-Democratic Party—from granting statehood to Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico to potentially overhauling the way Supreme Court appointments are made. The 37-year-old wants to make sure the U.S. doesn’t fall into permanent minority rule under the GOP, which is a big part of why the press started paying attention to him in the first place, especially millennial journalists at outlets like mine and others where we like to dwell on the precariousness of the entire U.S. political system (which is also why it’s a bit odd that some people on the left have caricatured him as a milquetoast moderate suit). What Buttigieg really hasn’t done is lay out a traditional domestic agenda focused on issues like economics or health care, the way Sens. Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren—whose entire campaign apparatus is essentially a mini think tank—have. Instead, he’s focused on telling his personal story, dropping literary references, and talking about national values, an Obama-esque strategy that’s yielded political dividends but probably can’t go on forever. I mean, even Beto O’Rourke, the LiveJournal candidate, just rolled out a 3,000-word climate change plan. At some point, Mayor Pete is going to need a big economic idea. One can’t campaign on a love of Ulysses and court reform alone. So I’d like to offer a suggestion. Buttigieg should back a job guarantee, but wrap the concept in a big gauzy, swath of patriotism by calling it a national service corps to win over moderates who’d ordinarily recoil at the idea. The jobs guarantee, you may recall, was the hot lefty policy idea around this time last year— an extremely simple and incredibly radical proposal in which the federal government would promise to directly provide a job to every American citizen who needs work. The notion has been floating around for a while, but after it gained traction in some thinkier corners of the internet, Democratic candidates including Sens. Cory Booker, Kirsten Gillibrand, and Sanders all backed some version. There are a number of, shall we say, unanswered questions about how a job guarantee would actually work. For one, nobody really has any clue what the government would hire all of these unemployed Americans to do; some advocates talk nebulously about “care work,” like looking after the elderly and children, a lot of which should probably be handled by professionals rather than a temporary workforce that waxes and wanes depending on the health of the economy. Others take inspiration from the Depression-era Works Progress Administration and Civilian Conservation Corps, and imagine massive public works projects, as if this wouldn’t massively tick off America’s construction unions. Rep. Ro Khanna, a Democratic congressman from Silicon Valley, has offered up a modified job guarantee (he prefers to call it a “job opportunity bill”) that tries to deal with some of these issues. Modeled off a smallish program that ran during the Great Recession, it would pay private employers in the nonprofit, public, and private sectors to hire workers who have either been unemployed for 90 days or whose income leaves them under the poverty line. The jobs would last up to 18 months, with the possibility of a temporary extension, with the goal of getting people into real-world jobs where they could receive some training and a foothold in the labor market. It’s the closest thing to a workable model for something resembling a job guarantee. Now, what does any of this have to do with Buttigieg? Lately, the candidate has been talking about how he’d like to create a supersized national service program, in order to try and foster a new sense of national unity and purpose. “We really want to talk about the threat to social cohesion that helps characterize this presidency but also just this era,” he told MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow earlier this month. “One thing we could do that would change that would be to make it, if not legally obligatory, but certainly a social norm that anybody after they’re 18 spends a year in national service.” Now, on the one hand, expanding opportunities for national service is typically a little hard to get excited about. It’s an old warhorse proposal politicians like to bring up when they want to get a glowing write-up from someone like David Brooks (who, by the way, seems very taken with Buttigieg). But here’s the thing: It’s also could be pretty wildly ambitious. There are around 8 million 18- and 19-year-old Americans right now. To put that in perspective, Americorps, our current stump of a (non-military) national service program, only has about 75,000 volunteers per year. If Buttigieg really wants to create a national service program that can provide every young adult with a gap year doing good in their community, he’ll have to do the sort of logistical thinking and planning necessary for a job guarantee. So why not go a little bigger? Why not mash together this hypothetical National Service Corps with a proposal like Khanna’s, by opening it up to the unemployed and underemployed who need job skills? You could even make private sector work an option for older applicants in need of a job or retraining? Politically, there are several advantages to this approach. For one, calling it a national service program instead of a job guarantee would probably disarm some of the opposition from moderates who are skeptical of socalism-tinged economic schemes. It would also give the government some leeway to scale the program over time, as more community organizations either sprouted up or expanded in order to start taking advantage of new workers. Now, am I writing all of this mostly because I’m a policy and economics geek who would be personally amused if an ex-McKinsey consultant managed to package a radical policy proposal with roots in the utopian left in a way that appealed to the mushy centrists of the New York Times opinion page? Sure, yes, absolutely. But I also think it’d be an interesting way for a candidate like Buttigieg to fuse his broad theme of restoring American institutions and national unity with a big play for economic justice. Just an idea. Support our journalism

Federal judge rules in favor of Democrats in emoluments lawsuit against Trump.,slate.com,Elliot Hannon,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/federal-judge-rules-for-democrats-emoluments-lawsuit-case-against-trump-hotel.html,"Barr Rigged Trump’s Acquittal A federal judge, on Tuesday, ruled in favor of congressional Democrats, allowing their lawsuit that accuses President Trump of violating the emoluments clauses of the Constitution to proceed. More than 200 Democrats in Congress filed suit against Trump last year alleging his ongoing business interests that have continued into his presidency amounts to receiving payments from foreign governments, which is expressly prohibited by the Constitution. Trump has technically stepped down from the day-to-day running of the Trump Organization, but still has ultimate authority over its operation and profits from its success. That creates problems, Democrats (and others) allege, because the president is in a position to directly benefit from the actions of foreign governments who could stay in his hotels or engage with any of his other businesses as an effort to curry favor. There is a separate case currently working its way through the court system, brought by the attorneys general of D.C. and Maryland, that specifically deals with the potential emolument violations of Trump’s D.C. hotel. In that case, Justice Department lawyers have successfully blocked efforts to subpoena Trump’s financial records, but Tuesday’s ruling gives new hope to Democrats looking to ensure Trump’s opaque financial dealings aren’t above the law. Justice Department lawyers representing the president had asked the court to dismiss the suit on the basis that, the DOJ says, the clause is not intended to be an overall ban on private business transactions with foreign governments. Despite decades of arguing the exact opposite, far stricter interpretation of emoluments, the DOJ has changed its tune under the Trump administration and adopted a far more tailored interpretation of the clause such that it only bars a president from taking payment from a foreign government for an act he undertakes in his official capacity as president. That literal reading seems like a pretty naive understanding of how influence and corruption are carried out. Either way, Trump’s lawyers say that since his profits are from market-rate transactions they are not emoluments, or gifts, just, you know, deals. District Judge Emmet G. Sullivan rejected the DOJ’s narrow interpretation of what constitutes an emolument as “unpersuasive and inconsistent.” Sullivan ruled in September that the Democrats had legal standing to pursue the case, but still needed to weigh in on the definition of an emolument in order to determine if Trump might be breaking the law. “The emoluments cases, which could eventually end up at the Supreme Court, appear to mark the first time that federal judges have interpreted these clauses and applied their restrictions to a sitting president,” the Washington Post reports . “Led by Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) and Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), the Democrats filed their suit last year asking the court to force Trump to stop accepting payments they consider violations of the Constitution’s foreign emoluments clause.” "
"Infrastructure Week, really? Democrats and Trump talk about a bill.",slate.com,Jim Newell,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/infrastructure-week-democrats-trump-meeting-really.html,"Trump Just Gave Democrats Another Reason to Launch an Impeachment Inquiry It is once again Infrastructure Week in Washington, and this time, it might be more than a joke. Congressional Democratic leaders visited the White House on Tuesday to sketch out the contours of a bill, and initial reactions suggested that the meeting went well, with all principals minding their manners. The two sides will aim for a $2 trillion package targeted at rebuilding “roads, highways, bridges, tunnels and railroads, modernizing our air travel system, and expanding broadband access for our great farmers and rural America,” per a White House statement. Democrats and the Trump administration agreed to meet again in a few weeks to discuss the more nettlesome question of financing. Is there any reason to believe that this infrastructure effort will end differently than any of the other times over the past decade that leaders have called for upgrading “our crumbling roads and bridges,” before forgetting about it? In fact, maybe. Some favorable incentives to pass such a bill are in place for the two most crucial figures in any major bipartisan legislation, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and President Donald Trump. But there are still vast policy disagreements separating the two sides, and whether they allow those disagreements to scuttle the entire effort is a political choice that all involved will have to make. Pelosi wants to show that her majority is capable of governing and to give her dozens of vulnerable House members—all of whom campaigned on passing an infrastructure bill—an accomplishment on which to run. Both she and those vulnerable members are particularly sensitive to the impression that they would only use their majority to investigate the president. This meeting, which Democrats requested just as they were getting a tsunami of questions about impeachment, was itself an effort to change the conversation. In Trump’s case, he, too, would like a big, bipartisan accomplishment that throws trillions of dollars toward American jobs while he’s running for reelection. No longer does he have to abide by former adviser Gary Cohn’s plan from early 2018 to leverage a more modest investment of $200 billion through the private sector. (Trump never liked that plan and was so bored upon its presentation that he drew doodles about Steve Bannon throughout the meeting about it.) Democrats control the House now, and they would prefer to spend on public investment rather than give private corporations some money to pocket. But, while the political will to spend trillions on infrastructure exists among both House Democrats and the White House, members of both parties are already drawing policy lines in the sand. On Monday, Pelosi and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer sent a letter to the White House saying that the package must be paid for “with substantial, new and real revenue.” Schumer, speaking on the Senate floor later that day, offered a suggestion for a source of revenue: rolling back some of Republicans’ signature 2017 tax legislation. “By reversing only the most egregious giveaways in President Trump’s tax bill—those given to the wealthiest of the wealthiest—and raising the corporate tax rate a smidge,” Schumer said. “We could finance the entirety of a trillion dollar infrastructure bill.” (Now that they’re looking at a $2 trillion bill, two smidges might be in order.) And while the president has been receptive to increasing the gas tax to pay for an infrastructure package, Democratic leaders are not. “Unless President Trump considers undoing some of the 2017 tax cuts for the wealthy,” a source close to Schumer said, “Schumer won’t even consider a proposal from the president to raise the gas tax, of which the poor and working people would bear the brunt.” “Working people shouldn’t take another big financial hit in order to be able to get to work and take care of essentials,” Sen. Ron Wyden, the ranking Democratic member of the Senate Finance Committee who was also at Tuesday’s White House meeting, told reporters on Monday, “and particularly not when the big multinational companies, which are causing most of the wear and tear to the infrastructure, got all of these tax breaks.” I asked Wyden whether he had any reason to believe that the president would be open to undoing some of his biggest legislative accomplishment. “You would have to ask him,” he said. Or I wouldn’t, because such a bill would never reach the Oval Office. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Tuesday that rolling back the 2017 tax bill, at all, to pay for an infrastructure package would be a “nonstarter” in the Senate. “You would have to ask him,” Wyden said. Or I wouldn’t, because such a bill would never reach the Oval Office. “This tax bill is what’s generated this robust economy,” McConnell said at his weekly press conference. “The last thing we want to do is step on all of this growth by stepping back and repealing, in effect, what has generated all of this prosperity and low unemployment.” Republicans in Congress, along with some of the president’s advisers, would prefer to bring down the bill’s cost by loosening requisite environmental, permitting, and labor regulations. While Trump was meeting with Democrats, his chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, made these points in an interview, saying that he’s told the president he “won’t see a single lane of traffic or road paved before the end of your second term” without regulatory changes.” Mulvaney was generally skeptical of a deal coming together. “Do I think there’s an interest in doing it? Yes,” he said. “Do I think there’s probably more interest, especially on the Democrats’ part, to make a show for trying to get a deal? Yeah.” Mick Mulvaney, a piece of work though he may be, may have it right here, even if it’s more of a two-way street than he lets on. As much as Pelosi may want to protect her front-line members facing reelection, she and Schumer must also recognize that cutting such a deal with Donald Trump would help his reelection chances and invite blowback from the Democratic base.And congressional Republicans, too, don’t want to give off the impression that everything runs smoothly when the Republican president works with a Democratic Congress. The safer route for either side would be to set up the meetings, walk through the motions, blame the other party’s rigidity as the talks fall apart, and then campaign blandly on infrastructure ahead of the election. And if neither party wins unified control of Congress and the White House in 2020? Repeat. Support our journalism

Mueller wrote letter to Attorney General Barr criticizing portrayal of Russia investigation findings.,slate.com,,05-01-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/05/mueller-wrote-letter-to-attorney-general-barr-criticizing-portrayal-of-russia-investigation-findings.html,"Swarthmore Students Occupy Frat House After Documents Leak With Reference to “Rape Attic” Special counsel Robert Mueller wrote a curt letter to Attorney General Bill Barr complaining about Barr’s characterization of the special counsel’s findings to Congress, the Washington Post reports . Days after Barr wrote a four-page memo to Congress outlining what he said were the key findings of the Mueller report, Mueller responded in a letter dated March 27, telling Barr he found his portrayal of the recently completed report “did not fully capture the context, nature, and substance” of the findings. Barr’s memo several days earlier was the first inkling the general public had received of the conclusions of the nearly two-year long special counsel investigation. Barr wrote that there was insufficient evidence of a criminal conspiracy by the Trump campaign in its dealings with Russians and that while Mueller’s team had not come to a conclusion on whether the president obstructed justice, Barr had reviewed the evidence and found there wasn’t enough of it to support charging Trump with obstruction. In his response to Barr, Mueller, per the Washington Post’s reporting, seemed to take umbrage with Barr’s characterization of the obstruction findings. “The summary letter the Department sent to Congress and released to the public late in the afternoon of March 24 did not fully capture the context, nature, and substance of this office’s work and conclusions,” Mueller wrote. “There is now public confusion about critical aspects of the results of our investigation. This threatens to undermine a central purpose for which the Department appointed the Special Counsel: to assure full public confidence in the outcome of the investigations.” The Barr memo was worded and released in such a way that implied Mueller had given Trump a pass on obstruction, a point which was picked up in news coverage of Barr’s description. When the Mueller report itself became public this month however, it became clear that Mueller had compiled a substantial obstruction case, leaving it to Congress to decide whether to pursue it. Barr’s release of the report’s findings, however, went to great lengths to set a narrative that Trump was in the clear and give it time to congeal well before there was any information available to refute Trump’s barrage of self-exculpatory tweets. Mueller’s letter appears to hint at that frustration around what appears to have been an intentional attempt to muddy the water. DOJ officials told the Post they were surprised at the tone of the letter and Barr and Mueller spoke on the phone for 15 minutes the following day in what was described as a cordial conversation that included differences on how to proceed with the report’s release. “After the Attorney General received Special Counsel Mueller’s letter, he called him to discuss it,” a Justice Department spokeswoman said Tuesday. “In a cordial and professional conversation, the Special Counsel emphasized that nothing in the Attorney General’s March 24 letter was inaccurate or misleading. But, he expressed frustration over the lack of context and the resulting media coverage regarding the Special Counsel’s obstruction analysis. They then discussed whether additional context from the report would be helpful and could be quickly released.” “However, the Attorney General ultimately determined that it would not be productive to release the report in piecemeal fashion,” the spokeswoman’s statement continues. “The Attorney General and the Special Counsel agreed to get the full report out with necessary redactions as expeditiously as possible.” Stay tuned, Barr is scheduled to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday morning for questioning."
Why it was so important for PewDiePie to denounce “subscribe to PewDiePie.”,slate.com,Evan Urquhart,05-01-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/technology/2019/05/pewdiepie-subscribe-meme-new-zealand-video.html,"Trump’s “Tim Apple” Gaffe Is No Gaffe at All. It’s a Sensible Way to Remember Someone. You know the violence has gotten pretty bad when a YouTuber feels it necessary to denounce his own subscription drive. In a video on Sunday, YouTube megastar PewDiePie made the surprising request that “I think it’s time to end the ‘subscribe to PewDiePie’ movement, or meme.” It was a belated response to the slogan being used by a mass murderer in Christchurch, New Zealand, on March 15—and to the phrase more generally having been adopted by the white supremacists and trolls found in online warrens like 8chan, where the shooter was a poster—but it should come as a relief to anyone who knows a young person who is a PewDiePie fan. Here, finally, is a place to start a conversation about how, sometimes, an “ironic” joke or a meme can sour into a calling card for a movement that non-ironically wants huge numbers of people to die for their religion or their race. If only there were a clearer dividing line between racist scum whom we should shun forever and 13-year-olds who like lolz, this world would be an easier place to live in. But like me, you might have young relatives, children of friends, or friends of your children who grew up watching PewDiePie play video games and goof around. If you ask them, you’ll probably find that many of these youth don’t understand why everyone is so mad at poor PewDiePie. Then, if you let them, they’ll probably try to explain to you, earnestly, that all those instances of anti-Semitism on PewDiePie’s YouTube channel were misunderstood jokes. Unless you’re lucky, after they explain this they won’t want to hear anything more. How did we get here? A Swedish gamer and entertainer known for his edgy humor and Let’s Play –style gaming videos, PewDiePie became the holder of the most-subscribed channel on YouTube in 2013, and he held that position until an Indian music channel called T-Series threatened to surpass his subscriber count last year. Although PewDiePie himself is more or less apolitical, those anti-Semitic jokes, and the backlash they engendered, earned him support and sympathy within the alt-right/white supremacist movement. PewDiePie, in return, has occasionally followed or recommended the content of some people from these communities. In that context, his drive to have people “subscribe to PewDiePie” in order to keep him at the top spot (thereby resisting a non-European, nonwhite challenge to his dominance) seems to have resonated deeply with racist online trolls, including one who vandalized a WWII memorial and another who became the shooter at Christchurch. The nuances of how an apolitical but edgy-racism-tinged YouTuber has become a symbol for real racists he disavows is a hard thing to explain to his young fans. I’ve blundered into more than a few of these conversations, and the result is always a train wreck. Provocative online trolls, including members of the alt-right, have set a neat trap whereby anyone who criticizes racist, sexist, or anti-Semitic humor is a hysterical social justice warrior, which doesn’t leave a lot of room to help a young person understand the ways “just joking” is currently being used by deadly serious racists to deflect, to camouflage, and to recruit. These people, whom PewDiePie dismissed in his video as a few deadbeats in an otherwise positive fan community, aren’t stanning the guy with the history of “ironic” anti-Semitism by accident. When you chum the water, it should come as no surprise when this attracts a pack of sharks. But although this is all perfectly clear to any adult who’s been paying attention, a young person who lacks a frame of reference may have trouble taking it in. This is especially so when online racists are waging a propaganda campaign to ensure these kids stay angry and alienated by anything that sounds even vaguely like something an SJW might say. That’s why PewDiePie coming out against his own subscription slogan feels so huge. Not because PewDiePie’s hands are clean, but because his willingness to draw the line at being associated with mass murder means that there actually is a line. It’s not just joking when the guy who says “subscribe to PewDiePie” goes on to take 50 innocent lives. It’s no longer a funny game when this same murderer flashes the OK sign , thereby tricking gullible people into thinking that … the OK sign is something a white supremacist mass murderer might flash. Whatever their origins, these jokes are not just jokes, and these memes are more than just memes. Who is using them now, and why, matters much more than the motives of whoever originated them. With his video, PewDiePie has finally acceded to the truth: Even if you personally disagree with murdering people for their race or religion, it is still possible that through your action or inaction you could give comfort and shelter to people who do. If this happens, then however innocent you feel yourself to be, you have a responsibility to act. This is no small thing. It is foundational to understanding how racism and hatred function in our world to know that it requires relatively little from us to grow strong and thrive—some silence here, laughing at a tasteless joke there, and before you know it your YouTube channel is the recruiting ground for would-be genocideers. If PewDiePie has accepted this, however late, however gracelessly and partially, it gives the rest of us a place to start when talking with his young fans."

Conan: Andy Richter didn't enjoy Avengers: Endgame because he saw the wrong movie.,slate.com,Matthew Dessem,05-01-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/culture/2019/05/andy-richter-avengers-endgame-romantic-comedy-homonym-conan-obrien.html,"The theatrical experience continues to decline. TBS After its box-office-record smashing weekend , everyone was talking about Avengers: Endgame , and the cast of Conan was no exception. On Tuesday, the late-night host discussed Marvel’s latest smash hit with his sidekick Andy Richter. Andy had a slightly different moviegoing experience than the rest of America: And that is why you never go to the movies at the Homonym on Wilshire. It was a cruel lesson for Richter, but it’s also an inspiring business model for the rest of us. If The Asylum has been able to lurch along since 1997 with a direct-to-video model based on homonyms and misunderstandings, there’s no reason consumers wouldn’t want to get ripped off the same way, but with popcorn. Why yes, this does seem like a good place to embed the trailer to Independents’ Day : I am a sucker for any joke in which two people believe they are taking about the same thing, but very much are not, and Richter’s moviegoing mishap is a good execution of that basic structure. But it’s still a sketch: both Richter and Conan are working from a script, slowly leaking out enough information to make the premise clear, and both men know that they’re making a joke. The best execution of this structure, now and probably forever, was Jon Hendren’s legendary discussion of Edward Snowden on HLN, in which he got host Yasmin Vossoughian to unwittingly help him pull off the same bit. Wait for it: It’s hilarious watching Hendren string Vossoughian along, but on rewatching, I realize his version of the joke is slightly hampered by the fact that he plays fast and loose with the details. There’s no waterbed or topiary in the movie, which is about a low-budget film director trying to make an epic about the North African campaign of the Roman Civil War.

"Introducing Man up, Slate’s podcast about manhood and masculinity in 2019.",slate.com,Aymann Ismail,05-01-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/human-interest/2019/05/man-up-podcast-masculinity-2019-aymann-ismail.html,"Comment Listen to the show in Apple Podcasts , another podcast player, or the player below. When they immigrated from Egypt, my parents brought a lot of ideas about what kind of men their sons should be. It was all around my blue-collar, immigrant corner of North Jersey: a wife from the tribe, dutiful kids, a man as the natural leader. As the youngest of four kids, three of them boys, I didn’t much question who I was meant to be. In fact, I took it for granted, shut down my doubts in my teen years, and took on an air of tough indifference. If I acted like that man, then I would be that man. It worked for a while. Fast forward about 15 years, and I’m married— kind of by accident . In two years with my wife, I’ve realized how little of our marriage my parents would recognize. My wife and I are open with each other about things I never thought I would talk about with anyone when I was younger, when I equated openness with failed masculinity. I didn’t plan it this way. At the same time, I didn’t fight it. I don’t know what changed to lead me to this place where I am not quite what I thought I’d be, and not entirely sure what I want to be, and yet here I am. And looking at what’s going on around me—in the relationships I see between other men and their families, men and other men, men and women, not only among friends and loved ones but in the news the past couple of years, and in our culture—it’s pretty obvious that the kind of man my hardheaded Muslim teenage self planned to become is not me. I want to know how and why that’s true, and I want to know what’s next for me and for guys who may be wondering the same about themselves. That’s the idea behind the new Slate podcast Man Up. In a previous series for Slate, “ Who’s Afraid of Aymann Ismail? ,” I traveled around the country to investigate stereotypes about American Muslims, whether that meant going to the office of a Islamophobic Texas legislator outside Dallas or excavating some of my family’s own skeletons . With Man Up, I’m doing a lot of the same: having tough, funny, enlightening conversations where I try to get beneath the notions we’ve taken for granted, and asking hard questions about the ideas we have about what a man should be. Every week, we’ll hear stories from men and women. They might be embarrassing or disturbing. The story might, as with our first episode live Wednesday, be about the urge to fight—to be aggressive and dominant—no matter the cost. It might be about growing up as the only girl in a group of male friends and what happens when your crew discovers sex. It might be about what happened when I yelled at my brother’s kids the way our dad once yelled at us (it wasn’t good). My goal is just to be as honest as possible, even when we don’t like what I hear, from others and from myself. As I start my own family, I’ve waited for some kind of eureka moment when I wake up with the complete sense of the man I ought to be, whatever that means. It hasn’t happened. So this is what I’m going to be investigating in these conversations, too: me. Every story I’ve heard so far has helped me figure out a little more about myself and form a more complicated picture of what being a man can mean. It turns out that if you are vulnerable, and ask for vulnerability, you might be surprised by what happens. And we want to invite you to do that with me. Tell me something you think about but can never quite find a way to talk about with other people. Send an email to , or better yet, leave me a voicemail at 805-626-8707. We’ll play some on the show and ask more questions. We’ll be back every week with more stories, I hope including yours. Support our journalism

iPhone reactions are ruining group texts and irritating friends.,slate.com,Shannon Palus,05-01-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/human-interest/2019/05/iphone-reactions-group-texts-chats-bad.html,"Rabbit Holes: If “Listening to Your Body” Is the Highest Virtue on Wellness Instagram, I’m a Saint Texting is how we now all communicate, which would be fine and pretty easy, except that the rules keep getting more complicated. A small, but terrible, complication was quietly introduced to texting in the fall of 2016, tucked into an update to iPhone operating systems: reactions. Right now, if you’ve got a friend who employs reactions you’re thinking, Oh God, those stupid things . For the blissfully uninitiated, there are six text reactions: thumbs up, thumbs down, double exclamation point, question mark, a heart, and “HA HA.” When you send someone a text on their iPhone, the recipient may choose to reply normally—you know, by texting back. Or the recipient may emit a reaction, a small blunt tool of confusion. Reactions are confusing and annoying. They’re quietly ruining group chats and therefore our society. Kill them! Like all facets of texting, these character expressions may seem simple to the untrained eye. Yet they’re less simple than entirely unformed, so meaning-free they require their own Rosetta stone to untangle —without the upside of actually enriching our language the way the vast and varied world of emojis can. The reaction confers no benefit, while making things more complicated. Is it curt to send a cartoon thumbs up to someone who has announced killing it at a work presentation? Is a question mark a sign of curiosity, or passive-aggressive confusion at a grammatical error? Is there anyone on the planet who would experience the warm camaraderie of laughter through “HA HA”? What? Slate Are these reactions supposed to be comments? Or some kind of telepathic intonation? From a design standpoint, it’s impossible to tell. While a text has a little tail on one side like a cartoon dialogue bubble, indicating that it is speech, reactions are trailed by a distinct small circle, giving the impression that the response it contains is being not said but thought . It is as though the heart, or thumbs up, is maybe supposed to be a first draft, or an idea, or a feeling, rather than a concrete statement. We simply do not need this additional layer of interpretability—or, really, mis-interpretability. Under very specific circumstances, reactions can be helpful in one-on-one interactions. Their primary utility is in indicating generously that you have seen a text, a more sophisticated and modern version of “kk,” or the dreaded “k.” I have a couple of dear friends who will often respond with a heart reaction. This is nice because we live in different cities, have busy schedules, and text heavy emotional things that cannot always be addressed immediately but call for some kind of acknowledgment. Also, I know for sure that these women are not passive-aggressive monsters. Utilized between us, the bubbles firmly convey “Got this, I’m available for a phone call soon, I bet you look amazing today.” Exercise caution using the reaction with anyone with whom you do not have this level of connection. And please— no matter how well you think things are going —exercise extreme caution with anyone you’ve been dating less than six months. When should you should avoid reactions, no matter what? Group interactions. This is not because reactions are objectively more confusing, meaning-wise, in larger text conversations. In fact, in larger group texts, all information flies so quickly that there often isn’t really time to wonder exactly what anyone is saying. Take things as literally as possible, and move on! A real cluster. Slate No, reactions ruin group texts because of crummy UI. When a member of a group text reacts to a message, the sender of the message receives a notification. (Fine, I guess, although I do not need a notification for HA HA. But why have this feature at all if at best it functions so similarly to a text?) But to the other people in the text, your reaction is an irritant. It is not clear, for example, who is doing the reacting. To see who reacted to, say, one friend’s text asking if anyone wants to meet up for drinks later, one has to—and I literally just figured this out—hold a finger down on the original text until a summary of the reactions and reactors pops up. Who has ever done this? Who has navigated a constantly shifting iOS interface expertly enough to get this relevant (?) information to pop up? The other thing—the biggest thing, really—is that reactions only work if you have an iPhone. If you do not, your friend’s reactions are delivered to you cumbersomely spelled out. If you are in a group text with even one Android user, everyone gets everything cumbersomely spelled out. Beware the story of the woman who was the lone iPhone user joining a group text full of Android-ees. When she reacted to a text, her new friends were getting not an ambiguous character in a thought bubble, but the words “laughed at” followed by the entirety of the reacted-to text message. As a befuddled group text mate recounted on Reddit : “ALL OF US WERE GETTING SECRETLY PISSED OFF AT HER!!” But even should Apple and Android someday combine forces to fix this UI, there’s just no upside to reactions. If you use them, please stop. Apple, please eliminate them! The archaeologists of the future already have enough to untangle with the blood-drop emoji ."

Michael Thomas/Getty Images Americans have a love affair with meat. Many romanticize the sizzle of a steak, the iron-pink bleed of a medium-rare burger, and the imagined farm they came from. It’s a love that has come at a cost: An enormous industrialized livestock system rife with animal abuse uses up massive amounts of land and water. It may also be responsible for nearly one-sixth of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions. Yet, tech-driven startups say they can offer a better way. New waves of investment have cell-cultured food companies in an edible space race to see who can get their so-called cell-based meat—animal tissue grown in bioreactors instead of live animals—on consumers’ plates first. Advances in molecular science have also fueled a new boom in plant-based meat offerings that look, smell, taste, and even grease and bleed like their fleshy counterparts. And these companies aren’t marketing to vegans and vegetarians. You can now get an Impossible Foods burger instead of a beef patty on your Burger King Whopper. Beyond Meat is stocked in the meat section of most U.S. grocery stores. But can these slaughter-free meat alternatives really become cheap and mainstream enough to replace your traditional chorizo or chicken nugget? Can these biotech creations overcome the uncanny “ick” valley from consumers stuck on ideas that meat should come from farms and not the lab?

Seasteading hits snags in Thailand.,slate.com,Joshua Keating,05-01-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/technology/2019/05/seasteading-thailand-chad-elwartowski-nadia-summergirl-thepdet.html,"With Smarter Living, the NYT Is Making an Old Bet on Service Journalism Every piece of land in the world (well, almost every piece ) is occupied by one country or another. Wherever you are, there’s a government looking to impose its laws on you. So what are you to do if none of the 193 or so national governments that have carved up the Earth’s landmass suit you? Take to the sea, obviously. That, more or less, is the thinking behind seasteading, a movement of people looking to create autonomous dwellings or cities at sea, outside the sovereignty of any nation-state. Seasteading has been in the news in recent days thanks to a couple—U.S. citizen Chad Elwartowski and his Thai partner, Supranee Thepdet, aka Nadia Summergirl—who have gone into hiding after being charged by the government of Thailand with violating national sovereignty by living in a small cabin mounted on a weighted spar, anchored 12 nautical miles off the shore of Phuket. The two are currently in hiding and the charge against them theoretically carries the death penalty, though Thai authorities, who have seized the property, say they may end up being charged with a lesser offense. The home was launched in February, funded by a group of entrepreneurs called Ocean Builders with assets gained from early investments in bitcoin. “I just want to get seasteading [to] happen for real. I want to make it happen here in Thailand,” Elwartowski told Reason in March, saying he saw his home as a proof of concept for more ambitious projects to come. If the project had been successful, the plan was to sell other units to create a sort of colony around Elwartowski and Summergirl’s seastead. A short documentary series on YouTube, The First Seasteaders , shows the raising of the 20-meter spar, during which Elwartowski proclaimed, “To all those out there who want to control people’s lives through force, here’s my big finger to you.” The seasteading concept has some historical antecedents , notably the Principality of Sealand, a long-standing micronation established on a disused British artillery platform in the North Sea by pirate-radio DJ Paddy Roy Bates in 1967. But the movement’s modern incarnation dates back to the founding of the Seasteading Institute in 2008 by Patri Friedman, a former Google employee and grandson of free market economist Milton Friedman. The institute received early financial backing from the libertarian billionaire Peter Thiel, though he’s since somewhat distanced himself from the project . “Nobody thinks two people on a floating home is a new country that’s going to threaten anyone’s sovereignty."" — Patri Friedman While the eventual goal of seasteading is still the creation of fully autonomous, politically sovereign communities, for the time being, the institute is looking to promote partnerships to build floating cities in cooperation with existing governments. The institute signed an agreement with the government of French Polynesia to build a lagoon in Tahiti in 2017, but the French Polynesian government has since declared that project void after public backslash. In an interview last week, I asked Friedman, who is still chairman of the board of the Seasteading Institute but says he is no longer involved in day-to-day operations, whether Elwartowski and Summergirl’s fate would be a setback for the movement, a discouragement for those who might want to try seasteading. “I think that it’s more likely to wise up potential seasteaders to make sure they dot their I’s and cross their T’s legally,” he told me. “What I’ve gathered from what Chad and Nadia wrote is that they did notify the Thai government in advance. So I think seasteaders need to make sure that they get things in writing, that they’re talking to the right parts of the government and don’t just assume good will.” Friedman drew a distinction between small-scale projects like this one and the “larger projects with nation-level partnerships” that have been the Seasteading Institute’s main focus. “Nobody thinks two people on a floating home is a new country that’s going to threaten anyone’s sovereignty,” he said. “It’s a honeymoon, not a country.” He said he believed other countries in the region could be more understanding and that Elwartowski and Summergirl might very well get another project up and running soon, on firmer legal footing this time. “It’s ridiculous that Thailand is saying that it’s treason to try out a new kind of floating home. It’s like threatening the death penalty for somebody not registering their car,” he added. It shouldn’t be surprising that Elwartowski and Summergirl were bitcoin investors. Friedman said he sees seasteading and cryptocurrency as simpatico movements for “people who believe in decentralization of things traditionally done by a monopoly government using new technology.” On the other hand, Friedman rejects the notion that seasteading is only for political libertarians. “That’s sort of the most visible group and the easiest branding with, say, Peter Thiel’s funding or my being Milton Friedman’s grandson,” he said. “But I don’t necessarily believe that libertarians or anyone else knows exactly how to make a great new government. The real problem is we don’t have ways to try out new laws and new systems of government at a small scale and scale up the ones that work. I think that I’ll probably like the more-libertarian ones best. But regardless of where I live, the more differentergovernments that are out there, the happier I will be.” When it’s not dismissed outright, seasteading is often ridiculed as a movement of Silicon Valley billionaires looking to avoid taxes or, in the longer term, escape ecological disaster. Friedman objects to that, saying, “There’s already a whole bunch of tax havens. We cannot compete with the Bahamas.” He says he believes that, in the long term, “most of the people who live [on seasteads] are going to be people from countries where the government doesn’t work very well. So even if those of us who have the resources to pursue it now are from that first-world demographic, I think that the people that it will help most are the people in the developing world.” While it would be a stretch to say that seasteading is gaining anything resembling mainstream acceptance, the general idea of sea-born construction is looking less far-fetched. The artificial islands China has been constructing to bolster its sovereignty claims in the South China Sea could be looked at as quasi-seasteads, though with more of a Tiananmen than a Burning Man political ethos behind them. Friedman also points to a speech from April by U.N. Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed in which she suggested that “floating cities can be part of our new arsenal of tools” for addressing the impact of sea level rise on coastal regions and small island states. Ironically, given this month’s events, she used Bangkok as an example of a city that is “sinking by around 2 centimeters every year … while sea levels in the Gulf of Thailand are rising.” Districts of floating houses have been looked at as a potential tool for climate change adaptation. As I discuss in my book, Invisible Countries , small island states facing the prospect of mass displacement due to climate change could resort to something resembling seasteading in order to maintain their political sovereignty, reinforcing “their territory to keep at least some physical structure above water and keep a small group of inhabitants behind, even if the bulk of the population has relocated.” This is not exactly the original intention behind seasteading. The idea was to allow people to escape the grasp of nation-states, rather than help existing nation-states perpetuate themselves in a warming world. But Friedman is unbothered by the shift. “If the economic driver for improving the seasteading technology is climate change mitigation, that’s great,” he said. “The more companies that are designing and building these things and the more mature the technology is, the easier that makes it for people that want to take to the sea for other reasons. Because it’s a very challenging environment, but, heck, it’s a lot less challenging than outer space.” "
Blood Heir’s YA author turns cancellation into a publicity boost.,slate.com,Ruth Graham,05-01-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/culture/2019/05/blood-heir-amelie-wen-zhao-controversy-publication.html,"Why Game of Thrones ’ Biggest Battle Was Such a Thrilling Disappointment First-time novelist Amélie Wen Zhao reportedly received a six-figure advance for her trilogy of young-adult novels, which she sold last year to a Penguin Random House imprint. Her story is set in a fictional empire with an enslaved underclass called Affinites; protagonist Princess Anastacya Mikhailov lives in hiding because of her similarity to the Affinites, and the plot unspools from there. Blood Heir , the first novel in the series, was scheduled to publish next month. That was before the novel came under a tidal wave of criticism from early readers who saw in the book an offensive likeness of American slavery and black oppression. In January, Zhao abruptly issued a statement apologizing for the “pain” her book had caused and asked her publisher to cancel its publication. Now, Zhao told the New York Times, she has changed her mind . Reeling from the criticism after pulling the book from publication, she took time to reread her manuscript several times and decided her critics were wrong. In March, she contacted her editor at Delacorte Press to tell her she wanted to proceed after all. Zhao and the publisher solicited new feedback from experts including a human-trafficking scholar, “academics from different multicultural backgrounds,” and multiple “ sensitivity readers ” who scan manuscripts for stereotypes. She made additions and revisions in response. “We ultimately think our YA readers are very smart,” her editor told the Times. “They can read what they want to read and use their critical thinking skills to work through it.” The tweaked version of Blood Heir will be published in November. So-called cancellation isn’t always permanent in the wider world. Blood Heir is not the only book to have run into the wood chipper of “YA Twitter,” the small but influential community of largely adult online readers who can make or break a book’s fortunes—or at least its online reputation—long before it is available to most readers. Laurie Forest’s much-hyped debut novel, The Black Witch , faced serious backlash in 2017 after one YA blogger called it “the most dangerous, offensive book I have ever read” in a nearly 9,000-word review that blasted the fantasy novel as “racist, ableist, [and] homophobic.” (The book was published on schedule.) Author Keira Drake postponed and revised her fantasy novel, The Continent , after early readers criticized it for trafficking in ugly stereotypes of Native Americans. In March, Kosoko Jackson pulled his first novel , a romantic thriller about a relationship between two teenage boys set in the Kosovo War, after a Goodreads reviewer called it out for representational offenses. Jackson issued a statement apologizing to “those who I hurt with my words.” (Like Zhao, he addressed his apology to “the book community.”) His next novel , about a gay teen who time-travels to the scene of the Stonewall riots, is scheduled to be published next year. In hindsight, Zhao’s handling of the episode is a master class in turning an online backlash into a boon. The move allowed her to make a public gesture toward taking her critics seriously, while also winning sympathy and support from the many people who view the YA community’s self-appointed representation police with distaste. Although the withdrawal looked like a defeat at the time, it also boosted Zhao’s profile significantly. The announcement of the book’s return was granted flattering coverage in the Times. And the novel itself will be published less than six months later than originally scheduled. The return of Blood Heir is a reminder that for all the agita about free speech and “Twitter mobs,” so-called cancellation isn’t always permanent in the wider world.

One of the early criticisms of Blood Heir was that it seemed to depict a black character named May being rescued from the slave trade, and then dying so the white protagonist can live. As one Twitter critic, YA novelist L.L. McKinney, put it at the time, the book was “pretty much about slavery and oppressions suffered by the Black community.” I haven’t read Blood Heir , which obviously has not yet been published. But Slate’s Aja Hoggatt read the first version in January and concluded that it’s not even clear that May is black. Zhao, who was raised in Beijing, said at the time that she intended to refer to indentured labor and human trafficking in Asia. In a new statement announcing the book’s comeback, Zhao goes further. “I researched extensively on the subject of modern-day human trafficking and indentured labor throughout the world and specifically from my heritage,” she writes. “It is my hope that Blood Heir will confront the silence surrounding this epidemic that continues to affect 45 million victims globally.” She emphasizes several times that she is writing from within her own culture, an important assurance for YA Twitter, which uses the term “own voices” to refer approvingly to a book written by an author whose marginalized identity (or identities) matches her protagonist. (Dip into this thread by one of Blood Heir’s early critics, in which she performs “50-page tests” on novels she is not sure she wants to read, rejecting many for violations like “Indian-inspired fantasy by a white woman” and “I don’t like reading about allocishet white boys, thank you.”) Zhao’s statement concludes that she is excited for readers “to have a chance to engage in further dialogue about these important social issues.” Time will tell how substantive Zhao’s revisions are and whether they will satisfy her critics. Does YA Twitter really want authors to change, or does it just want to tear down those who don’t kowtow to them? But reframing her fantasy novel as an invitation to “engage in dialogue” about a real-world issue is savvy, given the context. It’s easy to reject a “problematic” novel; according to the new rules of YA Twitter, that rejection can even be a moral act. It’s harder to reject an attempt to “confront the silence” around an indisputably horrific human tragedy. In emphasizing a social issue rather than a story, Zhao may have given her novel a second chance at life. It remains to be seen whether it will actually be good for her story. "
Barr Says Trump Was “Fully Cooperating” With Mueller Investigation When He Tried to Terminate the Mueller Investigation,slate.com,Ben Mathis-Lilley,05-01-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/05/barr-trump-full-cooperation-mueller.html,"America’s Attorney General Thinks Donald Trump Is Above the Law Here’s a fun short story of political absurdity. It begins with what Attorney General William Barr said in an April 18 press conference just before the public release of the full-but-redacted Robert Mueller special counsel report:
The White House fully cooperated with the special counsel’s investigation, providing unfettered access to campaign and White House documents, directing senior aides to testify freely, and asserting no privilege claims. It was clear when the report was released that “fully cooperated” was an extreme stretch given that Trump had, for example, literally dictated an announcement he wanted then–Attorney General Jeff Sessions to make that would have terminated the portion of Mueller’s work involving contacts between Trump and Russia. Here’s how the report summarizes that incident (Corey Lewandowski was one of Trump’s 2016 campaign managers):
On June 19, 2017, the President met one-on-one with Corey Lewandowski in the Oval Office and dictated a message to be delivered to Attorney General Sessions that would have had the effect of limiting the Russia investigation to future election interference only. One month later, the President met again with Lewandowski and followed up on the request to have Sessions limit the scope of the Russia investigation. (The phrase “limiting the Russia investigation to future election interference” is euphemistic here—the explicit purpose of the Mueller inquiry as it was formally defined was to examine “links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump” in order to “ensure a full and thorough investigation of the Russian government’s efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential campaign.”) Given that Sessions had recused himself from the investigation because it involved inquiries into his own conduct, Trump’s request was inappropriate on multiple levels—and, whether or not it rose to the level of criminal obstruction, certainly did not constitute full cooperation. On Wednesday, Vermont Sen. Patrick Leahy asked Barr about this, shall we say, tension during Barr’s appearance before the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Barr’s answers were … well:
LEAHY: You think that’s fully cooperating, to instruct a former aide to tell the attorney general to unrecuse himself, shut down the investigation, and declare the president did nothing wrong?
BARR: I don’t think—well, obviously, since I didn’t find it was obstruction, I felt that the evidence could not support obstruction.
LEAHY: I’m asking you if that’s fully cooperating. I’m not asking you if that’s obstruction. Is that fully cooperating?
BARR: He fully cooperated.
LEAHY: By instructing a former aide to tell the attorney general to unrecuse himself and shut down the investigation and declare the president did nothing wrong, that’s fully cooperating?
BARR: Where is that in the report?
LEAHY: That is on Volume II, page five—on June 19, 2017, the president dictated a message to Lewandowski that Jeff Sessions should publicly announce he was not recusing himself from the Russia investigation, that it’s very unfair to the president as the president has done nothing wrong. Is that cooperating?
BARR: Firstly, asking Sessions to unrecuse himself, we do not think, is obstruction.
LEAHY: —And to declare that the president did nothing wrong. I’m not asking you if it’s obstruction. Is it cooperating?
BARR: I don’t know if that declares the president did nothing wrong. Although the president, in terms of collusion, did nothing wrong. Isn’t that correct?
LEAHY: Collusion is not a crime. It’s the obstructing. But is that fully cooperating, to say that?
BARR: Well, I don’t see any conflict between that and fully cooperating with the investigation. So there you go. He doesn’t see it."
Venezuela: Maduro survives attempted military uprising. What happens now?,slate.com,Joshua Keating,05-01-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/05/venezuela-maduro-guaido-best-shot.html,"America’s Attorney General Thinks Donald Trump Is Above the Law This clearly wasn’t how it was supposed to go. On Tuesday morning, the Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaidó, who is recognized as the interim president of the country by the United States and other countries, broadcast a video from a military base flanked by armed National Guard troops who had defected to the opposition. It appeared that the armed forces of Venezuela, or at least a significant portion of them, might finally have turned on embattled de facto President Nicolás Maduro. But as the day wore on, it became clear that Guaidó didn’t have the numbers. After an initial skirmish, there were no additional signs of military forces fighting on the opposition side. The army remained with Maduro. Demonstrations flared throughout Caracas, and more than 60 people were injured , including in one grotesque incident, captured on video , in which an armored vehicle plowed into a throng of protesters on a crowded overpass. At the end of the day, Maduro appeared on TV flanked by his senior military commanders. Guaidó, from an undisclosed location, called for more protests Wednesday—May Day—but it’s becoming clear that the opposition took its best shot on Tuesday and fell short. Was something else supposed to happen? U.S. officials seemed to suggest so. In a video message posted on Twitter, National Security Adviser John Bolton named several senior Venezuelan officials who had “all agreed that Maduro had to go.” Sen. Marco Rubio tweeted that four of the men sitting with Maduro during his announcement had been involved in launching the uprising. It’s not clear quite how closely the Trump administration was involved with this overthrow attempt, but it seems like there was at least some expectation in Washington that these military brass would turn on Maduro when the time came. So what happens now? Guaidó and his supporters will continue to try to rally public support, but it’s unclear how many setbacks like this his movement can sustain. Leopoldo López, the former presidential candidate and opposition leader who had been imprisoned but then surprised supporters by appearing in public with his protégé Guaidó on Tuesday, has sought refuge at the Spanish Embassy . Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Wednesday that “ military action is possible ,” which sounds drastic but has more or less been the official U.S. position since the beginning. For now, it seems unlikely. The administration’s attention appears to be shifting to Venezuela’s foreign allies. Pompeo accused the Russian government of dissuading Maduro from leaving for Cuba on Tuesday. “He had an airplane on the tarmac. He was ready to leave this morning, as we understand it, and the Russians indicated he should stay.” (This could be true—the Russians have denied it—but it seems odd given that Maduro doesn’t appear to have ever been in any serious danger.) President Donald Trump also threatened Cuba with a “ full and complete embargo ” unless it ceases its military support for Maduro’s government. This would seem a pretty trivial threat given that Cuba has been under a U.S. embargo since the early 1960s. Yes, there are ways to tighten the embargo and amp up the pressure, but it seems unlikely the Cubans will fold after half a century. It feels more like an acknowledgment that Washington is running out of means to impose pressure on Venezuela itself. Much of the Trump administration’s bluster in the past two days—including Bolton’s message, in English, “to all the patriotic citizens of Venezuela,” appears intended more for consumption by voters in Florida than by the generals in Caracas. Without the military turning against Maduro, it’s hard to see a path to victory for the opposition, even with heavy backing from the U.S. and other foreign powers. Unfortunately, given the grim shambles of a situation he’s created in Venezuela, Maduro now appears likely to hang on to power."
Trevor Noah isn't impressed by Trump's nickname for Joe Biden (VIDEO).,slate.com,Natalia Winkelman,05-01-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/culture/2019/05/trevor-noah-joe-biden-sleepy-nickname-daily-show.html,"Here’s Why the Dothraki Attack in Game of Thrones Was So Devastating Since launching his campaign last week, Joe Biden has already gained ground with a tidal wave of media attention and a major speech in Pittsburgh . But another sign of the former Vice President’s growing popularity, as The Daily Show host Trevor Noah noted, is that he’s been graced with that most vile of distinctions: the Trumpian nickname. “Sleepy Joe,” as Trump has been calling Biden—while also seeking him out for a fisticuffs —brings to mind a sluggish man losing his wits, and it doesn’t help that Biden’s first rally was filled with verbal stumbles, such as substituting “hudge fund” for “hedge fund.” Of course, flubs are inevitable for speechmakers, and nobody’s better at spinning them than Trump. “When he makes a mistake, he doesn’t let it trip him up. He just creates a new reality and plows right through,” Noah said. As for the jeering new nickname: Calling someone sleepy is a sort of “weird slam,” but it’s bound to make for some pretty hilarious attack ad ammo.

While companies scramble to define what “A.I. ethics” means for them and citizens see algorithmic decision-making creeping into their daily experience, policymakers are facing tough choices about how to regulate this new computational wild west. Yet public dialogue about the future of A.I. seems to be stuck in a loop, repeating the same stories about killer robots, job-stealing A.I.s, and godlike supermachines. Is science fiction to blame for selling us simplistic visions of A.I. apocalypse? How can we make sure the stories we tell ourselves about intelligent machines will examine real-life challenges like data-based discrimination and privacy invasion, not just far-fetched threats like Terminator uprisings? What lessons can we learn about present-day policy conundrums from the rich history of A.I. in science-fiction literature and film?

America’s attorney general thinks Donald Trump is above the law.,slate.com,Dahlia Lithwick,05-01-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/05/william-barr-donald-trump-media-defense-obstruction-of-justice.html,"Barr Has Left Congress No Choice: Mueller Must Testify Next When Attorney General Bill Barr gave a press conference in advance of his release of the Mueller report on April 18, the most shocking moment came when he claimed that the president’s attempts to curtail the Mueller investigation were justified because the investigation had annoyed him. “The president was frustrated and angered by a sincere belief that the investigation was undermining his presidency, propelled by his political opponents, and fueled by illegal leaks,” Barr said. At the time, it was stunning how deliberately Barr seemed to be very specifically appropriating President Donald Trump’s extralegal talking point about blaming the press and the president’s enemies for the president’s conduct. As my colleague Mark Joseph Stern noted that day , this wasn’t a legal defense. It was nothing short of the claim that if the president feels harassed, it isn’t illegal to stop an investigation. As Stern put it:
Barr’s message here is simple: Trump is the real victim. The victim of the media and leaks. The victim of excess scrutiny and oversight. The victim of what Barr appears to believe was an overly intrusive investigation conducted by overzealous “federal agents and prosecutors.” All of Trump’s lying, his interference, his efforts to publicly discredit the probe, his public assault on Mueller—all of it is excusable, Barr implied, because the probe found “no collusion.” Indeed, Barr writes off Trump’s campaign against the investigation as a perfectly understandable effort to maintain his innocence. His acts were not obstructionary; they were noble. That defense was shocking not simply because it had nothing to do with the legal questions of conspiracy and obstruction before Mueller and Barr, but also because it seemed to have explicitly adopted and accepted the Trumpist worldview that holds any attempt at oversight or investigation deemed by the president to be unjustified harassment is illegitimate. This is, by the way, pretty much the same legal theory being invoked this week to reject the authority of congressional oversight and subpoenas . As Steve Vladek observed this past weekend, the defense that absolutely everything is a witch hunt and thus not legitimate is not a specific constitutional claim. It is, however, a recipe for a constitutional crisis. This now appears to be a central tenet of the legal strategy Trump and his surrogates are pushing forward, though. At his testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday morning, Barr seems to have again blamed the existence of a witch hunt against Trump for virtually everything Trump later did to put a stop to it. The press was again cited as the reason he rushed out his initial, erroneous summary of the report, as was the public’s “high state of agitation.” Barr even claimed that it was the press coverage of the initial Mueller report summary that troubled Mueller, rather than Barr’s own letter downplaying the report’s findings. Barr testified that Mueller told him “the press reporting had been inaccurate.” And yet, in Mueller’s March 27 letter objecting to Barr’s characterization of the report (which just became public on Tuesday ) there is NOTHING to suggest that Mueller thought it was the press that got it wrong. Then, in response to questions from Sen. Dianne Feinstein about why it was that Trump ordered former White House counsel Don McGahn to end the Mueller probe, Barr seems to have again taken the legal position that the president’s anger and frustration over press reports that he had instructed McGahn to fire Mueller somehow made this directive permissible. Barr seemed to be saying that Trump could not have committed obstruction by asking McGahn to fire Mueller, so long as he was attempting to forestall further negative press. As Barr put it:
If the president is being falsely accused, which the evidence now suggests that the accusations against him were false, and he knew they were false, and he felt that this investigation was unfair, propelled by his political opponents and was hampering his ability to govern, that is not a corrupt motive for replacing an independent counsel. This is an astonishing claim—that if the president feels that the investigation is unnecessary and is resulting in him being harassed or misrepresented in the media, then the president is justified in taking any action he sees fit to stop it without running afoul of the obstruction laws. It’s also a claim that was refuted in the Mueller report itself . It’s Nixonian in scope to imply that anything Trump wants to do in order to push back against the media and protect his reputation is legal and justified. Barr has not been having a good morning. Mueller’s now-public March 27 letter has revealed that the otherwise sphinx-like special counsel was frustrated by the way Barr initially characterized the report, putting the attorney general in a defensive position from which he has had trouble recovering. In addition to adopting and expanding the president’s war on the press and witch hunt defenses, Barr has now placed the Justice Department itself into the crosshair—implying that the DOJ itself and Mueller are bound to a view of the law that somehow takes into account the president’s antipathy and anger toward his perceived enemies as inherently exculpatory. We know that Donald Trump hates the media, and he hates being criticized, and he believes that his own suffering justifies all of his actions. We’ve known that for a long time. But for the attorney general to expressly adopt the view that the president can’t obstruct justice if he’s doing it because the press is annoying him is an appalling next step in the descent into establishing an imperial presidency, unchecked by either Congress or a free media. Every president believes the media gives him a raw deal. Barr just put the Justice Department’s imprimatur on the claim that such feelings put the president above the law. Support our journalism
