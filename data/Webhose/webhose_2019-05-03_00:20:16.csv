The Latest: UK lawmakers to vote on 4 options,www.dailypolitical.com,Trevor Kearing,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailypolitical.com/2019/04/03/the-latest-uk-lawmakers-to-vote-on-4-options.html,"5:20 p.m. Get alerts:
Four choices are being considered by british lawmakers to Prime Minister Theresa May Brexit bargain, in hopes of finding a plan which could command majority support.
Two proposals that aim to retain close ties between Britain and the European Union are for votes Monday night in Parliament included by the choices. An individual would continue to keep the U.K. at a customs union for products with the EU later Brexit, while the other requires Britain to remain in the bloc’s sole market for both goods and services. Another option needs any Brexit agreement to be filed to a public referendum, and also the fourth says Britain should cancel its death if it comes of crashing out of the bloc with no agreement within two days.
House of Commons Speaker John Bercow picked the options from eight thoughts filed.
___
2:55 p.m.
A major credit ratings agency has reiterated the collection of problems it foresees if the country crashes out of the European Union without an exit deal Britain encountering.
Standard & Poor’s said in an upgrade Monday a twisted Brexit would”adversely impact revenue levels and growth prospects, as well as government finances.”
S&P also has been warning that Britain’s withdrawal may”significantly restrict” access to key European economies.
S&P has said such a scenario could lead it to downgrade Britain’s AA credit rating.
The bargain three times of May has been voted down by parliament.
The EU gave Britain until April 12 to leave the bloc without a deal or to come up with a strategy.
It is uncertain if any alternative that might win approval in the House of Commons would be accepted by May.
___
1:25 p.m.
The chief executive of industrial maker Siemens U.K. is imploring British lawmakers to combine with a compromise Brexit deal, saying the country’s political chaos is creating the U.K. a”laughing stock.”
Parliament is set to vote Monday on alternatives to the Union withdrawal bargain proposed by Prime Minister Theresa May.
He said that choice will allow frictionless trade to continue involving the U.K. and also the EU, something many companies have come to rely on.
Maier also composed that Britain’s political paralysis has been”which makes it tough to win support for finely balanced investment decisions which in the end have an impact on U.K. jobs, innovation and the validity of our activities here.”
May’s spokesman, James Slack, states the prime minister knows that”business wants certainty.” He said lawmakers should support.
___
1 p.m.
Britain either has to leave the EU on April 12 or think of an alternate strategy, which — unless it determines to reverse Brexit — is most very likely to entail regretting its withdrawal in the bloc well prior to the May 23-26 European Parliament vote.
Some British politicians have indicated the U.K. could remain for longer without engaging in the EU elections. But European Commission leader Jean-Claude Juncker told reporters at Saarbruecken, Germany that”if the British have not left April 12 and there’s an extension, then Britain has to get involved in the European election.”
He added”that’s (in) that the treaty. Whether I want that is another question.”
___
12:35 p.m.
European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker says it is time to get the British Parliament to spell out what it wants on Brexit — and states the mythical sphinx is easier to decode than U.K. lawmakers.
After rejecting British Prime Minister Theresa May’s divorce bargain three times, U.K. lawmakers are holding a series of votes on Brexit alternatives Monday in an attempt to obtain the elusive thought that could control a majority.
Juncker stated in a speech Monday to the Saarland state legislature at Saarbruecken, Germany:”We know what the British Parliament does not want, but we haven’t heard what it wants.
Enough of the very long silence.”

11:40 a.m.
Ignore airline easyJet has warned that the U.K.’s pending withdrawal from the European Union is likely to hurt earnings in the second half of its fiscal year as travelers hold back on booking tickets amid the impasse over future connections.
EasyJet claims its first half loss of 275 million pounds ($360 million) was in expectations, but also the outlook for the six months through September will be”more careful” because of”softness in ticket yields from the U.K. and around Europe.”
Shares fell 8.3 percent in early London trading following the profit warning. Shares in other airlines and travel companies also fell, with British Airways proprietor IAG down 2 per cent and travel group TUI down 2.5 percent.
___
10:30 a.m.
Further evidence has emerged that British producers are building their cushions against the chance that the country crashes out of the European Union without a offer.
Financial information company IHS Markit found that Brexit stockpiling is giving a boost to manufacturing — at least briefly.
According to the firm, its purchasing managers index for the sector rose to a 13-month high in March into 55.1, up 3 points from the preceding month. Anything over 50 indicates a growth in output.
Stockpiling has become increasingly prevalent over the past few months as Britain’s exit looms — originally scheduled for March 29 but as delayed at least to April 12.
Given the doubt, companies have stored up on raw materials and on those products they need from everywhere in the EU.
___
8:45 a.m.
Prime Minister Theresa May’s main disciplinarian states the authorities ought to have told people they would need to accept a softer form of departing the European Union after May dropped her majority in the 2017 general election.
Smith says May known as the election to strengthen her hand in delivering Brexit, but was weakened when she lost her majority. He says the authorities”ought to have only been clearer the results of the, the parliamentary arithmetic, would signify that this would be necessarily a sort of softer kind of Brexit.”
The remarks come after Parliament rejected May’s EU withdrawal deal for a third period on Friday.

On April 4, the NATO alliance turns 70. Representatives from the alliance's current 29 member nations will meet in Washington to commemorate the occasion.
There's much to commemorate, as well as current issues to anticipate and address.
Arguably, NATO is the world's longest-lived military collective defense alliance.
The term ""collective defense"" matters in this preeminent estimate. In a collective defense alliance, allies pledge to defend each against external military threats.
When NATO turned 61 in 2010, the Brookings Institution concluded that 61 birthdays made it one of the six longest-lived military alliances since 1500 A.D. I'll try to minimize the footnote work and collapse historical debates. The Franco-Turkish alliance (established 1536) ostensibly persisted until 1914 (World War I), though as the 19th century elapsed, this alliance had expired. At times France and Ottoman Turkey fought as allies (Crimean War). However, the core deal was respect for the other's interests, not mutual defense. France and Britain's Entente Cordiale (1904) remains in effect, but when inked, it was basically an agreement to end their quarrels. 1919's ABC Pact (Argentina, Brazil and Chile) is nominally in effect, but it's a collective security deal, a notch down from defense. The UN (1945) is a collective security arrangement, not a collective defense alliance. The Organization of American States (1948) aspires to collective defense. But that aspiration rates a sad sigh. View Cartoon
NATO was anything but a laugh. It won the Cold War with the USSR, and since it won while avoiding thermonuclear devastation, it won brilliantly.
Yet as the Cold War waned, NATO death notices waxed. The obit crowd judged NATO a dinosaur of the bipolar world that they swore disappeared when the USSR shrank to Russia.
The obits reprised a Mark Twain one-liner. When Twain learned that a New York newspaper had published his obit, he wisecracked, ""The reports of my death are greatly exaggerated.""
Why did the obit writers get it wrong? Some were schooled on reductive headlines focused on the Washington-Moscow face-off, so they missed the complexities. Others were ideologues bogged by reductive reasoning; it's all communism versus capitalism! However, the geopolitical world has never been bipolar. Our world is fragmented, with multipolar eddies vexing Great Powers that rise and -- unless they adapt to new conditions -- fall, no matter their creeds or politics.
NATO adapts. During the 1990s, it became a collective security alliance and a collective defense alliance. Fighting international terrorism (9/11) and ""out of region"" contingency operations to deter a threat are collective security operations.
Russia attacked Georgia (not a NATO member) in 2008. The Russian bear was reviving. Recommended Beth Baumann
In 2010 (date of Brookings report), the Kremlin declared that NATO's enlargement was Russia's principal threat.
Be your own worst enemy, Vlad. NATO's Article 5 collective defense guarantee exemplifies the hard Cold War diplomacy that has 21st-century value.
Article 5's nickname has a French literary connection: ""the three musketeers clause."" One for all and all for one, the dashing musketeers affirmed. Article 5 says that ""an armed attack against one or more of them ... shall be considered an attack against them all.""
Article 5 has been invoked just once: the day after al-Qaida's 9/11 attacks on the U.S.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has made degrading NATO a foreign policy goal. Why? Because NATO deters his ambitions. Article 5 is the core of it, but not the whole story.
Finland and Sweden (so-called neutrals) know NATO is vital. Truth is they've known for 70 years. A substantial number of citizens in Finland and Sweden support NATO membership.
Seventy years of NATO still matters, to Europe and the U.S., because an alliance coordinating the defense of democratic nations still serves several critical purposes. Fighting and winning complex belligerencies requires coordination. "

The five federal court districts that sit along the U.S.-Mexico border were the top five districts in the country for the number of defendants they convicted and sentenced to imprisonment in fiscal 2018, according to data published by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts.
The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas ranked No. 1. It convicted 8,179 criminal defendants and sentenced 7,126 of them to imprisonment in the last fiscal year.
It was followed by the Southern District of Texas (6,140/5,939), the Southern District of California (5,723/5,470), the District of Arizona (4,731/4,378) and the District of New Mexico (3,979/3,923).
The combined jurisdictions of these five federal district courts cover the U.S.-Mexico border from the Pacific to the Gulf of Mexico.
The other five U.S. District Courts that rounded out the top 10 were the Southern District of Florida (2,279/2,104), the Northern District of Texas (1,504/1,431), the Middle District of Florida (1,568/1,388), the Southern District of New York (1,369/1,283) and the Central District of California (1,141/946).
The 7,126 criminals convicted and sentenced to imprisonment by the Western District of Texas in fiscal 2018 were more than five times the 1,283 convicted and sentenced to imprisonment by the Southern District of New York.
In fiscal 2018, according to Table D-7-1 published by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, a total of 79,704 criminal defendants had their cases disposed of by U.S. District Courts. View Cartoon
Of these, only 6,595 -- or 8.3 percent -- were not convicted. That included 6,275 whose cases were dismissed, 237 who were acquitted in a jury trial and 83 who were acquitted in a bench trial.
The other 73,109 criminal defendants were convicted and sentenced to some type of penalty. Of these, 1,330 were only fined, and 6,437 were released under supervision and 65,342 were sentenced to imprisonment.
In the nation-leading Western District of Texas, the court disposed of the cases of 8,470 defendants. Of these, only 291 -- or 3.4 percent -- were not convicted. These included 273 whose cases were dismissed, 14 who were acquitted in a jury trial and 4 who were acquitted in a bench trial.
The 8,179 defendants who were convicted and sentenced in the Western District of Texas included 10 who were only fined, 1,043 who were released under supervision and 7,126 who were sentenced to imprisonment.
The most common alleged offenses in the Western District of Texas, not surprisingly, were immigration-related, according to Table D-9-1 published by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts. Of the 8,470 defendants whose cases the court disposed of in fiscal 2018, 4,995 were categorized as ""improper reentry by an alien."" Another 860 were described as ""other immigration offenses.""
Other defendants whose cases were disposed of by the Western District of Texas, however, included 772 cases involving alleged non-marijuana-related drug offenses; 727 alleged marijuana-related offenses; 337 alleged offenses involving firearms or explosives; 306 alleged cases of fraud; 82 alleged sex offenses; 47 alleged assaults; 46 alleged cases of burglary, larceny or theft; and 17 alleged robberies. Recommended Beth Baumann
There is a historical lesson to be learned from this data.
In fiscal year 2000, according to Table 2 in the United States Attorneys' Annual Statistical Report for that year, U.S. district courts found 57,746 criminal defendants convicted of crimes. The five top districts that year for defendants found guilty were the Western District of Texas (4,129), the Southern District of Texas (3,984), the Southern District of California (3,960), Arizona (3,177) and the Southern District of Florida (2,047).
New Mexico finished sixth (1,689).
In fiscal 2010, according to Table 2 in that year's U.S. Attorneys' report, U.S. district courts found 81,934 defendants were convicted of crimes. The top five districts that year were the Southern District of Texas (8,406), the Western District of Texas (8,218), Arizona (5,715), the Southern District of California (4,773) and New Mexico (3,905).
Southern Florida dropped to sixth (2,570).
The lesson: The political leaders of this nation have known for years that the sort of criminal activity that is prosecuted in federal courts -- as demonstrated by the government's own data on federal court convictions -- is disproportionately focused along the nation's southern border.
And they have not fixed it. "
Nancy Pelosi's Perv Problem,townhall.com,Michelle Malkin,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://townhall.com/columnists/michellemalkin/2019/04/03/nancy-pelosis-perv-problem-n2544182,"
""Joe Biden's woman-touching habit.""
""VP Joe Biden goes #FiftyShadesofGrey during last night's awkward Top Ten List.""
But not until two Democratic women came forward this past week was Biden forced to respond. Nevada Democrat Lucy Flores accused the hair-sniffing 76-year-old Beltway barnacle of making her feel ""uneasy, gross, and confused"" at a campaign event in 2014. Former Connecticut Democratic aide Amy Lappos described how Biden ""rubbed noses with me"" at a private fundraiser in 2009 after grabbing her face with both hands. It was ""absolutely disrespectful of my personal boundaries.""
If these were women accusing Republican men of such behavior, Pelosi would be issuing scathing recriminations, not jokey etiquette tips. But Nan's nonchalance about her fellow Democrats' invasions of personal space is par for her cad-supporting course. I remind my readers of Pelosi's twisted track record:
In 2017, she defiantly stood by accused groper John Conyers calling him an ""icon"" who ""has done a great deal to protect women"" and downplaying his secret sexual harassment settlement with a former female staffer -- one of three former employees alleging sexual abuse.
In 2013, Pelosi refused to call on her old pal and former Democratic mayor Bob Filner of San Diego to resign after multiple women accused him of harassment and assault. One staffer claimed Filner had ordered her to ""work without her panties on."" Others alleged he forcibly kissed them. Another said she had contacted Democratic higher-ups in California about a half-dozen women. ""What goes on in San Diego is up to the people of San Diego. I'm not here to make any judgments,"" Pelosi declared.
In 2011, Pelosi refused to condemn disgraced Rep. Anthony Weiner until his interactions with an underage girl in Delaware were exposed by conservative bloggers and confirmed by police. Only then did Pelosi rush from behind to lead the demands for Weiner's resignation.
In 2010, then New York Democratic Rep. Eric Massa resigned amid a sordid sexual harassment scandal involving young low-paid male staffers he allegedly lured to his Capitol Hill playhouse for ""tickle fights."" Pelosi's office had been informed months before, by a staffer of former Democratic Rep. Barney Frank, of Massa's predatory and harassing behavior with multiple congressional employees. Massa's former deputy chief of staff and legislative director also contacted leading Democrats on the House Ethics Committee. Former House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer also knew of Massa's misconduct. But Pelosi said and did nothing until allegations went public. A toothless House Ethics Committee investigation went nowhere. Recommended Hmm: AOC's Former Staffer Has An Interesting Admission About 'Democratic Socialism' Beth Baumann
Also in 2011, seven-term liberal congressman and former Democratic Rep. David Wu of Oregon was exposed by his own staffers, who revolted against their drunk-texting, tiger costume-wearing boss and pressured him to seek psychiatric help. House Democratic leaders, desperate to keep one of their own in office, ignored the pleas. Only after The Oregonian newspaper published allegations by a teenage girl who had complained for months to apathetic Capitol Hill offices of an ""unwanted sexual encounter"" with Wu did Pelosi make a show of calling for a House Ethics Committee investigation -- which went, you guessed it, nowhere.
Yet, just days ago in The New York Times, feminist Tina Brown heaped praise on creep-enabler Pelosi's unique leadership tied to her XX chromosomes -- a woman's ""rich ways of knowing"" that rejects ""traditional male paths of ejaculatory self-elevation."" Reality does not match the rhetoric.

In the aftermath of the February 2018 mass murder at a Parkland, Florida high school, it became readily apparent that danger signs and evidence abounded that a disturbed former student at the school was likely going to commit such a heinous crime. Despite local, state and federal law enforcement officials having possession of such knowledge, they failed to act on that information even though they had lawful and ready means to do so.
Now, rather than hold responsible those who failed in their responsibilities in that tragedy, and to address specifically the reasons why our law enforcement and judicial systems failed in that instance, state governments and the Congress of the United States are moving to dramatically reduce due process protections for everyone , or at least for everyone who owns a firearm. The vehicle being used to thus undermine citizens’ rights guaranteed by the Second Amendment, are so-called “red flag” laws (also known as “Emergency Risk Protections Orders”).
The problems evident in the Parkland mass murder and others – Sutherland Springs, Texas in 2017, Charleston, SC in 2015, and Sandy Hook in 2012 -- are very real and very serious; and need to be addressed. However, doing so in ways that expand the government’s power to confiscate law-abiding citizens’ firearms without affording them long-standing and constitutionally-based due process, is neither necessary nor appropriate. Yet this is precisely what is happening. View Cartoon
To gun-control advocates like 2020 presidential hopeful Sen. Cory Booker, every mass shooting is the result of insufficient gun-control laws –“loopholes” in Liberal Speak. To them, the failure on the part of law enforcement and other government agencies to have used the training, laws and procedures already available to them prior to a shooting tragedy, is not the problem. The problem always is that there were not enough gun control laws in the first place. In this worldview, the default solution is to give government more power to control and limit firearms. Thus – red flag laws.
“Restraining orders”– that is, orders issued by judges that prevent individuals from doing something – are not new. Courts in our country, using procedures inherited in large measure from the English common law, have long recognized that there will be situations in which threatened or anticipated harm can provide a basis for a court doing something not normally favored or allowed – taking a person’s property or freedom without full opportunity for that person to defend against such action. Such procedures are the exception to the rule, however, and must be – and to this point, have been – carefully circumscribed and limited. Only in the rarest of circumstances are such restraining orders issued ex parte ; that is, without notice to the target of the order to defend against the action.
The new red flag law proposals now being enacted by several states, and aided by proposals being pushed in the Congress by Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) and others, take the concept of a judicial restraining order to a new, and problematic level. These proposals create a new category of restraining orders applicable to owners of firearms, and would permit virtually anyone at any time to enlist local law enforcement and a judge to issue ex parte orders (sometimes by phone) directing law enforcement to seize a person’s firearms based on fear that they might in the future commit a bad act with a gun. Recommended BREAKING: DOJ Slams Accusations Attorney General Barr is Mishandling the Release of Mueller's Report Katie Pavlich
The concerns fueling these “red flag” proposals are genuine, and they are urgent. The solution, however, is not to toss due process out the window in the name of “public safety.” The question we ought to be asking (and to which we should be demanding answers) is why the powers and the tools already possessed by police agencies and our courts at all levels of government, are not being employed when and how they should be.
The problem is greatly exacerbated because state governments have for years failed in their responsibility to provide adequate funding and personnel resources with which to address mental health issued displayed, often openly, by individuals like Nikolas Cruz in Parkland prior to their deadly rampages.
Yet, rather than address these long-standing problems, with better training, more funding, and holding accountable bureaucrats and law enforcement officials who fail in their responsibilities, state governments are rushing to enact red flag laws and the Congress, as evident in last week’s Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on this very topic, appears ready to donate tens of millions of taxpayer dollars to state governments to establish such procedures.
Red flag laws offer a comforting solution to an exceedingly complex problem; but they come at a heavy cost to our Bill of Rights. "
Democrats for Trump (Apparently),townhall.com,Bill Murchison,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://townhall.com/columnists/billmurchison/2019/04/03/democrats-for-trump-apparently-n2544178,"Police Aren't Enough
The second-most extraneous topic in American politics is to what effect Joe Biden's invasion of Lucy Flores' personal space by kissing her noggin has on the Democratic presidential race -- and maybe life in general.
Which leaves in first place the fervent efforts of leading Democrats to excavate from the Mueller report such evidence as destroys the reign of President Donald Trump.
This isn't to call Trump innocent of reproach or personal behavior worse than that which Biden may have engaged in at his morally sloppiest. It is to wonder that the Democrats have yet to figure out what people seem to want from their political leaders in these extraordinary times.
Speaker Nancy Pelosi is no pal of the president's -- or of his policies -- but she has a hard-bitten demeanor that prevents her imagining that voters long for a knock-down, drag-out over impeachment of the president for offenses that seem not to overwhelmingly interest the voters.
What interests the voters overwhelmingly, the polls indicate, is the economy, and then health care costs, and then education, terrorism and immigration in varying order, depending on when you ask the question. But Rep. Adam Schiff and the Democratic House's trumpeted suspicions about the Muller report engage far fewer Americans than might have been the case last month.
One doesn't have to argue that the report ""exonerated"" Trump -- that's to say cleared him, congratulated him, recommended him for the Nobel Prize -- to find the report and its results a poor fit for modern anxieties. What are we looking for here, now that Attorney General William Barr has declared the absence of evidence pointing to collusion with the Russians and Robert Mueller hasn't been heard dissenting from Barr's interpretation? What we seem to be looking for, those who can't let go of this thing, is an excuse not to contest the next presidential election with well-thought-out plans for knocking over and extinguishing Trump's presidential legacies. View Cartoon
If Trumpian collusion, atop the usual catalog of personal sins, looks to be right now becoming a ho-hum issue for 2020, it's up to Schiff to see what he can do about it and to remind voters what the true stakes are: namely, turning the country over to the Democrats.
This is, in fact, a fair aspiration -- a part of the game called politics. If, whatever your party, you're nutty enough to want to run the United States, free speech gives you the right to try. At any political level, you're entitled to develop a political program and take it to the voters, so they can render judgment on you. If, say, Lucy Flores thinks Joe Biden got in her face five years ago and, hence, doesn't deserve to govern us, power to her for saying so -- for so long as she can convince herself it matters to people with other things on their minds, such as the economy and the country's leaky borders.
But if such suspicions outrank in your own mind the stated concerns of the voters, you've, um, got significant problems. This may be one reason some Democrats cling to collusion like a mountaineer clings to his rope: Drop it and down you go. Democrats appear not to have decided who they are or what they want. They lack coherent programs, especially in economic terms -- the terms that affect the largest number of voters by affecting their jobs and paychecks. Left-wing Democrats such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Elizabeth Warren have the big idea that the country requires bigger, costlier government. It is their right to say so. It is the voters' right, correspondingly, to respond. No wonder the idea of keeping the Mueller report front and center appeals to party leaders and candidates with wet thumbs in the air, waiting to see which way the political winds blow.

I have been an advocate for years of changing our Social Security system to a program of ownership rather than government taxing and spending.
To those walking around with the idea that Social Security is some kind of pension in which you have been investing for years -- forget it.
Current retirees get their money from payroll taxes paid by those currently working. It's a government tax-and-spend program.
The problem is that because Americans are living longer (good news) but having fewer children (bad news), the number of working Americans per retiree keeps shrinking. The only way to keep the program going is raising taxes or cutting benefits as the worker-to-retiree ratio continues to shrink.
D-Day, when the whole thing is now projected to collapse, according to Social Security Trustees, is 2034 -- just 15 years away. Revenues projected for that year will cover only 79 percent of the funds needed for payout to retirees.
Keeping the finances in balance will require a 21 percent benefit cut, a 27 percent tax increase or some combination.
But the problem really isn't just one of demographics and arithmetic. It's a problem of principles.
After President Franklin D Roosevelt signed Social Security into law in 1935, its constitutionality was challenged. That case, Helvering v. Davis, in which the Supreme Court found Social Security constitutional, changed the landscape of America regarding our sense of the role of government. View Cartoon
Prior to this, the welfare state, so much a part of our lives today, where government taxes one set of citizens and redistributes to another, was not understood to be among the powers the constitution grants to the federal government.
Helvering v. Davis changed all that and opened the door to any federal program that could be deemed in the ""general welfare.""
Once, the lion's share of federal spending was defense. Today, defense comprises only 15 percent of the federal budget, with most of the $4.2 trillion of federal spending going to entitlement and welfare programs, which are key drivers of our massive federal deficits and debt accumulation.
Invariably, when I convey that Social Security is an entitlement program, I get indignant letters from people saying they paid taxes all their working life to qualify for this benefit.
Some 62 million are now collecting Social Security benefits. According to Gallup, 57 percent of retirees say Social Security is a ""major source"" of their retirement income.
But none of these tens of millions are in the system by choice.
Government forces them to pay in. Government determines what they will get. And government determines the conditions under which they will get it.
And government has changed the rules innumerable times, and now it is about to change them again -- if we allow it. Recommended Hmm: AOC's Former Staffer Has An Interesting Admission About 'Democratic Socialism' Beth Baumann
The extent to which Americans have conceded the moral dignity and economic benefits of ownership, allowing government to take control of their lives, has hurt our country.
Countless studies have shown that investing the equivalent of one's payroll tax in a personal retirement account over a 45-year working life would produce far higher returns than Social Security now delivers. Now those Social Security returns are about to get worse with the changes necessary to get the system back in balance.
Equally important, you own your personal account. It's your personal wealth that you control and watch accumulate, and that you can pass on to heirs.
This is particularly important to low-income Americans who have no other platform for accumulating and bequeathing wealth.
According to Gallup, 36 percent of African Americans compared with 60 percent of white Americans own stock in some form.
Bringing a culture of ownership to low-income Americans can be transformational.
Nothing could be more American than to reform and transform our broken Social Security system to a system of personal ownership, saving and wealth accumulation. "
Better Than Obamacare,townhall.com,Betsy Mccaughey,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://townhall.com/columnists/betsymccaughey/2019/04/03/better-than-obamacare-n2544188,"Police Aren't Enough
""If the Supreme Court rules that Obamacare is out, we'll have a plan that is far better than Obamacare,"" President Donald Trump pledged Wednesday. Democrats and their media toadies attacked, claiming Trump will sucker-punch consumers with ""junk"" plans and abandon people with preexisting conditions -- even cause about 20 million Americans to lose coverage, as New York Times columnist Paul Krugman warns. These claims are lies.
Trump said the plan will be released after the 2020 election, but White House health experts have already put out reports suggesting what the Trump alternative will look like. The key pieces are a special fund for people with preexisting conditions, lower-cost plans and Medicaid reform.
The Trump administration wants to protect people with preexisting conditions by duplicating nationwide what several states have done to fund coverage for the sick separately. That's not abandoning the sick.
A tiny 5% of the population consumes nearly 50% of the healthcare. Forcing consumers to pay the same for insurance regardless of health status, as Obamacare does, is extortion. Actuarial experts explain that's why Obamacare premiums have almost tripled since 2013.
When healthy consumers in Alaska rebelled against skyrocketing premiums, the state set up a separate fund to pay the costs of seriously ill Alaskans out of general revenue, rather than hide the cost inside the premiums that healthy buyers pay. Premiums dropped 22% overall and 39% for bronze plans. Now, other states are experiencing similar success. View Cartoon
Is the money available for a nationwide guarantee? Yes. Coverage for chronically ill people in the individual market will cost about $20 billion a year, less than half the $55 billion spent subsidizing people to overpay for Obamacare. The remaining funds will be sufficient to subsidize premiums in the individual market, which will be substantially lower than now.
A February report from Trump's Council of Economic Advisers proposes this remedy, disproving whopper No. 1, that Trump will forsake people with serious illnesses. Democrats claim Obamacare is the only way to cover preexisting conditions. Wrong. It's just the unfairest way.
Trump's reform will also slash premiums by liberating consumers from having to buy plans loaded with items Obamacare mandates, such as pediatric dental care -- even if you don't have kids -- or maternity coverage -- even if you're 50. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi ardently defends these mandates, warning insurance with fewer benefits is ""junk"" and insisting consumers need protection. That's whopper No. 2. Look who's actually being protected.
Insurance companies -- they helped write Obamacare. Mandated benefits are their profit protection, not consumer protection. The more a plan costs, the more profits the law allows insurers to make.
The Trump administration is trying to circumvent Obamacare's insurance rules and enable consumers to buy low-cost options such as short-term plans and association plans. But House Democrats just introduced a bill outlawing these options, which the Congressional Budget Office predicts some 6 million buyers will prefer within three years. Who's ripping coverage away from millions? The Dems. Recommended Hmm: AOC's Former Staffer Has An Interesting Admission About 'Democratic Socialism' Beth Baumann
That brings us to whopper No. 3, that Trump's reforms will cause millions to become uninsured. Here are the facts: Of the 20 million newly covered because of Obamacare, three-quarters went on Medicaid, not private health plans. Medicaid was originally meant for low-income women with children and the disabled. The health law added millions of able-bodied childless adults. Trump isn't revoking the Medicaid expansion.
But the administration wants able-bodied recipients to work. A shocking 40% don't work, even part time. The administration already backs state efforts to discourage freeloading, and a Trump replacement plan should make it nationwide. Healthy Medicaid recipients would be required to work, attend school, care for family or volunteer. In short, get off the couch.
Democratic pols say it's ""cruel."" Really? Why should taxpayers support healthy people who refuse to work, when jobs are plentiful?
Don't believe the dire predictions. Trump's reforms will enable millions priced out of Obamacare to buy insurance, while protecting people with preexisting conditions and getting the scammers out of Medicaid.

When Joe Biden Is Suddenly Creepy,townhall.com,Brent Bozell,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://townhall.com/columnists/brentbozellandtimgraham/2019/04/03/when-joe-biden-is-suddenly-creepy-n2544176,"When Joe Biden Is Suddenly Creepy Share The opinions expressed by columnists are their own and do not represent the views of Townhall.com. Source: AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin Planned Parenthood on the Defensive
The Democrat-media complex has suddenly decided that Joe Biden has a creepiness problem. Why now? Why not when he was vice president for eight years? Does anyone remember the allegedly fierce White House press corps pelting the press secretary with questions, asking when then-President Obama would tell his understudy to stop putting his hands on women -- and little girls -- and putting his face uncomfortably close to theirs?
There have been scads of photos of Biden pawing women, putting his arms around girls, kissing their necks, etc. Conservatives have mocked them for a long time. But liberals always suggested it was just ""Biden being Biden.""
Back in February 2015, the internet went viral with pictures and video footage of Biden at the swearing-in ceremony for Ash Carter as secretary of defense. He stood behind Carter's wife, Stephanie Carter, and placed his hands on her shoulders and his nose in her ear, whispering ... something. The optics were eerie, to say the least. But this was Uncle Joe, and it generated only a light gasp followed by giggles.
NBC noted that The Washington Post called him ""the world's most powerful close talker."" ABC actually quoted The Daily Caller for a giggle: The new secretary of defense ""Can't Even Defend His Wife From Joe Biden,"" the Caller headlined. They were also jokey at CNN, as John King mused, ""I guess it all depends on your generation and your view of Joe Biden. But at one point, if you watch her eyes, she looks like she wishes she could say, 'Scotty, beam me up.'"" View Cartoon
This changed last Friday, when Lucy Flores, a 2014 Democratic candidate for lieutenant governor of Nevada, recounted a tale of then-Vice President Biden grabbing her by the shoulders, and leaning in to smell her hair and kiss her on the head. Flores is a backer of Sen. Bernie Sanders.
She testified: ""I felt two hands on my shoulders. I froze. 'Why is the vice-president of the United States touching me? ... He leaned further in and inhaled my hair. I was mortified ... He proceeded to plant a big slow kiss on the back of my head. My brain couldn't process what was happening. I was embarrassed. I was shocked. I was confused.""
Biden issued a statement in response: ""I have offered countless handshakes, hugs, expressions of affection, support and comfort. And not once -- never -- did I believe I acted inappropriately.""
So what happened to turn the tables on Uncle Joe, who's now five years older, and presumably less menacing? The big change in the interim is the #MeToo movement, of course, where excesses have ruined what would otherwise be a noble demand for a return to chivalry. Biden's behavior in no way compares to the rapacious assaults of a Harvey Weinstein. There's no evidence of sexual harassment. It doesn't matter. To the radicals, perception's enough to justify a lynching. Recommended Hmm: AOC's Former Staffer Has An Interesting Admission About 'Democratic Socialism' Beth Baumann
But it's not just the #MeToo overreach. Biden is leading in many polls, and that's a problem for the radicals who perceive that he's not leftist enough. He's not perceived to be as leftist as Sanders. He's not perceived to be as leftist as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. It doesn't matter that he favors abortion on demand, or that he declared in 2012 that transgender discrimination is ""the civil rights issue of our time."" It doesn't matter that he's taken a far-left position on just about everything. He may rate a 99 percent on the left, but it is looking for 103 percent.
The No. 1 ""journalism"" objective in 2020 is beating President Trump. They are clearly seeking to remove the biggest obstacle to an American socialist revolution. Democrats who don't march in lockstep may be yesterday's news.

"Mike Pence Threatens Strong Action Against Cuba, Vows to Keep Pressure On Venezuelas Maduro",www.newsweek.com,,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsweek.com/mike-pence-strong-action-cuba-venezuela-1384035,"Vice President Mike Pence issued a stern warning to Cuba on Tuesday, accusing the Caribbean nation of providing support to the government of Venezuela’s President Nicolás Maduro.
The White House will take “strong action not only to isolate Venezuela but also we’re looking at strong action against Cuba,” Pence said Tuesday, according to Bloomberg ’s Jennifer Jacobs. Cuba “continues to provide personnel and support to the dictatorship in Venezuela,” the vice president alleged. He added that President Donald Trump is considering “a broad range of options.”
Prior to his remarks on Cuba, Pence called for the release of six executives of Citgo Petroleum Corporation, who have been detained in Venezuela for more than a year. “They’re being held illegally,” he said, Bloomberg reported . “[Maduro’s] regime should release all political prisoners.”
Vice President Mike Pence speaks during the annual Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in National Harbor, Maryland, on March 1. Pence issued a stern warning to Cuba on Tuesday, accusing the Caribbean nation of providing support to the government of Venezuela’s President Nicolás Maduro. MANDEL NGAN/AFP/Getty Images The Citgo executives were arrested in Venezuela just before Thanksgiving in 2017. Five of the six are American citizens, according to NBC News . They were initially called to fly to island nation for a corporate meeting with Venezuela’s state oil giant PDVSA. However, during the conference they were arrested by Venezuelan authorities and Maduro's government accused them of embezzlement.
Pence’s comments regarding Venezuela and Cuba came as he met with family members of the detained executives. “The vice president will reiterate the administration’s deep concern for the welfare and safety of all wrongfully detained American citizens and he will call on Maduro to release all political prisoners immediately and unconditionally,” a White House official told Reuters prior to the Tuesday meeting.
In Venezuela, the Trump administration has backed opposition leader Juan Guaidó, who has declared himself interim president. Although Maduro has dismissed the challenge as “coup” and accused the U.S. of trying to kill him, Guaidó, who heads Venezuela’s National Assembly, claims that he is acting within provisions laid out by the constitution. Maduro won re-election last year in an election that was condemned by the opposition and many in the international community. A large number of Venezeulans boycotted the election all together and the opposition leveled accusations of voter fraud.

Trump administration officials have repeatedly signaled that the White House plans to increase pressure on the Latin American governments of Venezuela and Cuba, as well as Nicaragua. At the beginning of November, White House national security adviser John Bolton dubbed the three nations the “troika of tyranny,” and referred to their leaders as the “Three Stooges” of socialism.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo also took aim at the three countries after meeting with Brazil’s newly inaugurated right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro in early January. “Look forward to working together [with Bolsonaro] to support those suffering in #Cuba, #Nicaragua, and #Venezuela under the weight of dictatorships [sic],” Pompeo wrote on Twitter.
But some lawmakers have raised concerns about the Trump administration’s policies toward the Latin American nations. Representative Ilhan Omar, a progressive Democrat from Minnesota, has pointed to double standards in Washington’s efforts to address human rights violations. In an editorial published by The Washington Post last month, Omar argued that “we do not have the credibility” to call out abuses by adversarial governments in Venezuela, Cuba and Nicaragua, when we “do not also support those fighting for human rights” in friendly Latin American nations such as Guatemala, Honduras and Brazil.

The Assembly Labor and Employment Committee will consider two California Chamber of Commerce-opposed bills that would add another layer of burdens on employers and their ability to manage their workforce.
On April 3, the committee will consider: AB 628 (Bonta; D-Oakland) significantly expands the definition under the Labor Code, which is inconsistent with the definition in the Government Code, which will lead to inconsistent implementation of anti-harassment policies, confusion, and litigation. Also, provides an unprecedented, uncapped leave of absence for victims and their “family members,” which is broadly defined, that will add another layer of burdens on employers and their ability to manage their workforce. AB 1224 (Gray; D-Merced) Unduly burdens and increases costs on employers by mandating they provide an additional three-month protected leave of absence from work for family medical leave, that could total over 6 months of leave for an employee, and exposes employers to costly litigation for any alleged violation. AB 628: Uncapped New Leave of Absence for Employees and Their Family Members
CalChamber is opposed to AB 628 because the bill would create inconsistent definitions under the Labor Code and Government Code, impose an unlimited leave of absence on employers for employees and their family members, and impose another pathway for costly litigation against employers for issues that are already protected under the Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA).
Although the CalChamber supports efforts to eliminate harassment in the workplace, this proposal will create significant challenges for employers to manage their workforce and comply with existing anti-harassment requirements. AB 1224: New Three-Month Leave of Absence on Employers
AB 1224 creates a new leave whereby an employee needs to work for an employer only for 900 hours in the 12 months before taking leave. This would expand the amount of protect leave and employer must grant to half a year.
The CalChamber-led coalition opposing the bill is concerned that AB 1224 will: Impose Additional and Overwhelming Costs on Employers . Even though the leave under AB 1224 is not “paid” by the employer, that does not mean the employer will not endure added costs. While the employee is on leave, the employer will have to: 1) maintain medical benefits; 2) pay for a temporary employee to cover for the employee on leave, usually at a higher premium given the limited duration of employment; or 3) pay overtime to other employees to cover the work of the employee on leave. Expose Employers to Costly Litigation for Potentially Frivolous Claims . AB 1224 exposes employers to costly litigation under FEHA. An employee who believes the employer did not provide the 12 weeks of protected leave could pursue a claim against the employer seeking compensatory damages, injunctive relief, declaratory relief, punitive damages, and attorney’s fees.

AB 628 and AB 1224 will be heard in Assembly Labor and Employment on April 3. CalChamber is urging businesses to contact their Assembly member on the committee and urge them to oppose AB 628 and AB 1224 ."

Americans Borrowed $88 Billion to Pay for Health Care Last Year: Survey
A new report from Gallup and the nonprofit West Health on “The U.S. Healthcare Cost Crisis” includes some sobering numbers about the financial burdens created by the current system — and about Americans’ fears about the broader economic hit that could result from spiraling costs.
“Relative to the quality of the care they receive, Americans overwhelmingly agree they pay too much, and receive too little, and few have confidence that elected officials can solve the problem,” Gallup says. More than three in four Americans believe they pay too much for care relative to the quality of care they get. Most Americans (64 percent) say they are “completely” or “mostly” satisfied with their own health care experiences, but that figure drops to 39 percent when they consider how the system serves Americans in general. Americans borrowed an estimated $88 billion to pay for health care in the past year. Gallup estimates that 2.7 million Americans borrowed at least $10,000 and another 1.6 million borrowed more than $5,000. Americans pulled an estimated $126 billion from savings to pay for health care in the past year. Sixty-five million adults did not seek treatment for a health issue in the past year, and 15 million have deferred buying prescription drugs, because of the costs. Forty-five percent of Americans, including a third of those earning more than $180,000 a year, are concerned that a major health issue could bankrupt them. Given a choice between freezing health care costs for the next five years or a 10 percent boost to their household income, 61 percent said they prefer the freeze in costs. Three in four Americans expect their health care costs to keep rising over the next two years. Seventy-seven percent believe the government isn’t doing enough to keep prescription drugs affordable, while 74 percent say the same about health care costs in general. Seventy-seven percent say they are concerned that health care costs will result do lasting damage to the U.S. economy. About 70 percent of Americans say they have no confidence in their elected officials to bring down health care costs via consensus legislation.
The survey of more than 3,500 U.S. adults was conducted January 14 to February 20.
A separate Gallup survey released Monday found that health care tops the list of American’s worries for the fifth straight year, followed by federal spending and the budget deficit. "
"IRS Audits Hit the Working Poor, African Americans Harder",www.thefiscaltimes.com,mrainey,04-03-2019,2019,4,http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2019/04/02/IRS-Audits-Hit-Working-Poor-African-Americans-Harder,"IRS Audits Hit the Working Poor, African Americans Harder iStockphoto April 2, 2019 MOST POPULAR
Where does the IRS focus its audits in the U.S.? According to a new study by Kim M. Bloomquist, a former senior economist at the tax agency, the most heavily audited county is not, as you might suspect, New York County, home to Wall Street and many finance industry titans, or Santa Clara County, California, where Silicon Valley millionaires prowl the streets in electric-powered sports cars. No, the area whose residents have the highest audit rate is Humphreys County, Mississippi, and its residents are quite poor and disproportionately African American.
Writing about the report at ProPublica, Paul Kiel and Hannah Fresques say that the working poor are audited by the IRS at unusually high levels, and as a result, residents of rural counties in the South receive more attention from the tax agency than their fellow citizens in wealthier parts of the country.
The reason? The working poor are more likely to claim the earned income tax credit, which is designed to help low-income workers by boosting incomes through tax rebates. But the IRS now audits EITC recipients “at higher rates than all but the richest Americans,” Kiel and Fresques say, citing a ProPublica study published last year. As a result, the counties with the highest audit rates are poorer than average, and many have higher-than-average minority populations:
“The five counties with the highest audit rates are all predominantly African American, rural counties in the Deep South. The audit rate is also very high in South Texas’ largely Hispanic counties and in counties with Native American reservations, such as in South Dakota. Primarily poor, white counties, such as those in eastern Kentucky in Appalachia, also have elevated audit rates.”
Humphreys County attracts so much attention from the IRS because more than half of its taxpayers claim the earned income tax credit, the authors say. “Humphreys, with a median annual household income of just $26,000, is audited at a rate 51 percent higher than Loudoun County, Virginia, which boasts a median income of $130,000, the highest in the country.”

Why Trump Punted on Obamacare Replacement Until After 2020 Elections,www.thefiscaltimes.com,yrosenberg,04-03-2019,2019,4,http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2019/04/02/Why-Trump-Punted-Obamacare-Replacement-Until-After-2020-Elections,"Why Trump Punted on Obamacare Replacement Until After 2020 Elections JOSHUA ROBERTS/Reuters April 2, 2019 MOST POPULAR
In a flurry of tweets Monday night, President Trump continued to criticize the Affordable Care Act but indicated that any new vote on a Republican plan to replace the law would wait until after the 2020 elections, essentially punting on a hot-button political issue he had resurrected just last week to the consternation of many Republicans.
The Trump administration argued in a court filing last week that the entire Obama health care law should be ruled unconstitutional. Trump followed up on that filing by declaring that the GOP would soon be known as “the party of health care,” but his fellow Republicans were surprised by Trump’s push and generally wary of reengaging in a fight that helped Democrats retake control of the House in the 2018 elections. And the ensuing scramble made clear that the party still doesn’t have an Obamacare alternative that it can coalesce behind, even as Trump announced that GOP lawmakers would “come up with something really spectacular.”
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) told reporters on Tuesday that he spoke with the president Monday and made clear that the Senate will not be taking up comprehensive health care legislation before the 2020 election. Trump’s tweets came after that conversation.
White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said Tuesday that the president ""wants to work with Congress to come up with the right health care plan."" She added that Trump is focused on protecting patients with preexisting medical conditions, making care more affordable and giving patients a say in the care that they receive.
Why it matters: Trump appears to have accepted GOP calls that he hold off on a new Obamacare replacement effort and instead focus his reelection strategy on attacking Democratic Medicare-for-all proposals. That likely makes political sense, for now, especially since Republicans don’t have a plan — and even if they did have one, it wouldn’t have a chance of passing a divided Congress. It’s much easier to attack the Democratic plans, promise Americans will get “great health care” and leave the thorny details aside.
Trump’s decision ensures that health care will be front and center in the 2020 elections, though it alleviates some of the immediate pressure on Republicans to produce a plan. In the meantime, though, the Trump administration continues to support a lawsuit that could result in the Affordable Care Act being struck down — and 20 million Americans losing coverage — without providing an alternative. “In short,” writes Bloomberg columnist Max Nisen, “the GOP is gambling with the stability of the U.S. health-care system because its best health policy ideas can’t pass on their own merits.”
The bottom line: The problem for Trump, New York magazine’s left-leaning columnist Jonathan Chait says , is that “the Republican party is structurally and endemically incapable of devising a health-care program that is remotely acceptable to the public. The reason, which has been amply demonstrated over the last decade, is that most people think ‘great’ health insurance gives everybody access to medical care. But paying for that care requires some combination of taxes and regulations on insurance, both of which violate conservative dogma.” "
Sen. Ron Wyden Proposes Annual Capital Gains Tax,www.thefiscaltimes.com,mrainey,04-03-2019,2019,4,http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2019/04/02/Sen-Ron-Wyden-Proposes-Annual-Capital-Gains-Tax,"Sen. Ron Wyden Proposes Annual Capital Gains Tax JOSHUA ROBERTS April 2, 2019 MOST POPULAR
Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, wants to change the way capital gains are taxed by imposing an annual levy on investments.
How it would work: While Wyden said details would come at a future date, the general idea is that investors would pay a tax based on valuations of their holdings each year, with all annual gains treated like income – even gains that have not been realized. This “mark-to-market” approach would tax all capital gains at a maximum rate of 37 percent.
How it works now: Currently, capital gains are taxed only when an asset is sold. Year-to-year increases in value are not taxed, as long as an investor continues to own a given asset, and in some cases, assets can pass to descendants without ever being taxed. When gains are realized, they are taxed at a special, lower rate that tops out at 23.8 percent.
Who would be affected: Capital gains are concentrated in high-income households. According to the Tax Policy Center , “In 2016, capital gains were 46.4% of adjusted gross income (AGI) for those with AGI over $10 million, compared to 0.7% for those with AGI under $100,000.”
Why the change? In a statement Tuesday, Wyden framed the proposal as a way to reduce wealth inequality:
“There are two tax codes in America. The first is for nurses, police officers and factory workers—those who earn wages and pay taxes with every paycheck. The second is for millionaires and billionaires—those who use their wealth to build more wealth, paying what they want, when they want.
Everyone needs to pay their fair share and the best approach to achieving that goal is a mark-to-market system that would require the wealthy to pay taxes on their gains every year at the same rates all other income is taxed. This eliminates serious loopholes that allow some to pay a lower rate than wage earners, to delay their taxes indefinitely, and in some cases, to avoid paying tax at all.”
What the critics are saying: Most agree that the proposal has little chance of passing any time soon, but it clearly would represent a significant change for the way wealth is taxed in the U.S. Lily Batchelder of NYU Law School tweeted ,“Wow, this is a game changer” that would raise “a huge amount of revenue from the wealthy.” Her colleague David Kamin agreed, saying the proposal “has potential to raise significant $$ and make it much harder for those at the top to avoid taxes.” But he also pointed to important, potentially thorny issues, such as how annual volatility would be treated and how non-liquid assets would be valued.
David Miller, a tax lawyer, told Bloomberg that in his estimate, a mark-to-market capital gains tax on the wealthiest households could raise hundreds of billions of dollars of revenue over 10 years.
But the opposition to such a system would no doubt be intense. Sen. Pat Toomey (R-PA) dismissed the proposal as a “breathtakingly terrible idea,” and said it would go nowhere as long as Republicans were in a position to stop it. "

The IDF informed the family of a Palestinian who killed an IDF soldier and Israeli civilian in a terror attack outside the settlement of Ariel that their home will be confiscated and demolished in less than a week.The head of the Central Command, Maj.-Gen. Nadav Padan, signed an order on Wednesday to confiscate and demolish the apartment where Omar Abu Lila lived. The demolition order will take effect on Tuesday.Abu Lila fatally stabbed 19-year-old St.-Sgt. Gal Keidan on March 17 at the Ariel junction and then stole his gun, shooting him at close range before opening fire at vehicles passing through the junction, fatally hitting a 47-year-old father of 11, Rabbi Ahiad Ettinger.Abu Lila then stole a car and drove to the nearby Gitai junction, where again opened fire, striking soldier St.-Sgt. Alexander Dvorsky, who remains in the hospital.Abu Lila then fled on foot into the nearby village of Burqin, and was killed in a shootout with authorities two days later in the Palestinian village of Abwein, north of Ramallah.While some NGOs and human rights organizations criticize the army for using collective punishment by demolishing the homes of the terrorist’s families, the IDF believes they are a key deterrent to stop other potential attackers.Nevertheless homes razed by the Israeli military have been rebuilt, most recently by the family of Ashraf Walid Suleiman Na’alwa who shot dead two Israeli civilians in the Barkan industrial zone in October.Meanwhile, a terrorist who attempted on Wednesday to stab an Israeli driver stuck in a traffic jam at the Bitot Junction near the village of Huwara south of Nablus, was shot by the driver and subsequently died. The Palestinian was transferred to Beilinson Hospital in critical condition and died from his wounds.Yehoshua Sherman, director of URP’s field division, was in the vehicle when the Palestinian, holding a knife, tried to open the door.“I left the vehicle while the terrorist tried to overtake the next vehicle. I neutralized him by gunfire while assisting another resident from a nearby settlement who was behind me,” Sherman said.“This incident illustrates the importance of completing the construction of the Huwara bypass as agreed with the prime minister,” said the head of the Shomron Regional Council Yossi Dagan. Dagan also backed the father who neutralized the terrorist and saved his daughter.Samaria has been a hotbed for terrorist attacks and attempted terrorist attacks in recent months.Late last month, a bus was set alight after terrorist allegedly threw a Molotov cocktail at it in the northern West Bank near the settlement of Kedumim, according to local media reports.While the bus was damaged, there were no injuries since it was empty.Just days before, two Israelis were lightly injured after a Molotov cocktail was thrown at their vehicle in the northern West Bank, close to the city of Nablus.On March 18, two Israelis, a 19-year-old soldier and 47-year-old father of 11, were killed in a terrorist attack near the settlement of Ariel.An IDF officer was seriously injured and a Border Police soldier was lightly injured after Palestinians rammed them with their car during an arrest operation in the West Bank, the military reported following the event.The force opened fire on the vehicle’s three occupants, killing two and wounding the third, who was arrested. The Palestinian Ministry of Health identified the two killed as 20-year-olds Amir Mahmoud Darraj from the village of Kharbatha al-Misbah and Youssef Raed Mahmoud Anqawi from Beit Sira. The injured Palestinian, also aged 20, was identified as Haitham Jumaa Alqam from the village of Safa. Ilanit Chernick contributed to this report.

French President Emmanuel Macron has called for a European Renaissance. This article examines the potential business risks this proposal portends for foreign investors.
On March 4th, French President Emmanuel Macron seized the spiritual banner of the European Union (EU) and made his case appealing for a Renaissance of the Union. The core principles of the EU are being challenged on many fronts. There is an ugly Brexit battle in the west, scorn and vitriol from Italy and Greece in the south, and nationalistic attacks on the EU’s structures in Warsaw, Budapest , and other capitals. Macron’s attempt to rekindle the European spirit is a very public attempt to repudiate the populist agenda simmering throughout the member states. But will there be a Renaissance; will the EU continue to centralize power and inspire European unity? Or will there instead be a period of policy strife and conflict? More importantly from a political risk perspective: how will the near future of the EU impact business interests on the continent?
Future of Europe: Gazing into the crystal ball The United Kingdom’s torturous Brexit process serves one clear purpose for the rest of the EU: member states and their populations have seen that divorce from the Union is a painful and costly process. Nevertheless, it represents an extreme manifestation of the growing dissatisfaction of many European voters on the direction the EU has taken. Populist parties, especially, have seized on scapegoating the EU as a political ploy to drum up votes.
Complaining about the structure or policies of the EU has been a trend for many years. However, now the tone has shifted to a cri de coeur from voters who are frustrated by economic stagnation and are grappling with the dramatic wave of recent migration into the EU.
The EU is likely entering a challenging period of bureaucratic stagnation and painful public debate. Macron’s public spat with populist leadership in Italy is emblematic of this Sturm und Drang struggle in Europe. Progressive, liberal EU-oriented leadership will be forced to reckon with underlying symptoms of the populist wave. Spurred by both economic discontent and a strong desire for ‘tradition’ (which is often simply xenophobia in its myriad manifestations), the populist movements are almost universally challenging the value and direction of the EU.
Macron’s attempt to ignite a counter-movement is generally well-received by the public in other EU nations. However, the vitriol poured on him by political opponents in France underscored that his position as a long-term spur to European renewal is fragile at best.
The European parliamentary elections in May will undoubtedly reflect this divergence in opinion about the Union’s future. Certain parties are committed to dismantling or degrading the structure of the EU to further their own agendas – and they may have the votes to do it.
What political risks do businesses in Europe face? This struggle over the direction of the EU will also determine how it is positioned as a business platform vis-à-vis other major trading powers in the next decade. Of special interest, of course, are the competitive markets in China and the United States. Recent calls to create ‘European Champions’ , especially in the tech industry, suggest member state leaders are willing to embrace a more protectionist position. This would help them to compete against the United States and China for their share of global trade. Additionally, what else can we expect from the internal struggle to renew or revamp the EU in the wake of ‘Brexit’? With strong populist forces dictating the terms of public debate, what political risks will businesses face?
Fortress America will encourage a similar reaction in Europe The Trump administration’s hardline stance with China, which has slowed global growth, may at long last be paying some dividends in opening China, at least on paper, to more favourable terms for U.S. trade. While the U.S. – EU trade war has been in abeyance pending discussions between the trade offices in the two countries, those negotiations have shown little progress. If the U.S. uses similar tactics with the EU, the resulting trade conflict could drag on for an extended period. It will, in the short-to-medium term, risk that further trade barriers will be set up against U.S. companies and other competitors to protect EU interests.
Combined with German and French shared interests to challenge the U.S. on tech and fight the influence of U.S.-based companies such as Apple, Google and Microsoft; there is a substantial risk that both direct and indirect methods of regulation (such as the GDPR) will be imposed to limit U.S. access to the EU market.
Competition law will change, ostensibly in favour of EU consolidation Despite wrenchingly different perspectives among member state constituencies, the national governments seem committed to change. They want to restructure competition law in the EU to support European mergers so that they are theoretically more competitive. Since the issues are complex and don’t appear to lend themselves to populist scare-mongering, endeavours to support the creation of ‘European Champions’ of industry should meet with comparatively little public interest or resistance. The Franco-German alliance is, on this issue , stable and strong. Other nations have signed up to reforming the competition system as well, agreeing that the system is outdated. With Commissioner Vestager leaving her position , the bureaucracy which supports EU competition reviews and policies will be more open (and vulnerable) to change.
Increased scrutiny of financial transactions and the role of the European bank Banks moving operations out of the UK due to Brexit were already warned of a forthcoming increase in scrutiny as the traditional financial centre of London becomes diffused over the EU. These moves have been to Frankfurt, Luxembourg, Paris, and Dublin, among others. The growing concern over Russian funds being whitewashed by banks in the Baltic States and Scandinavia means that this is an area where member states and the EU will find common ground to enhance scrutiny and tighten the rules on foreign funds entering the EU banking system. However, a greater role and further autonomy for the European Central Bank in monetary policy is likely not in the cards due to concerns from populist parties as to its role in the economy.
The Brexit crucible Regardless of the political battles to determine the direction of the EU in the next few years – whether to centralize and re-invigorate the ‘ever closer union’, or to decentralize powers back to the member states in certain areas – the painful divorce process that the globe has witnessed with the UK’s attempt to leave the EU serves one positive purpose. For most observers, watching the UK struggle to extricate itself has cooled their ardour to do the same. From a political risk perspective, the risk of further fracturing of the union has decreased in the immediate future. While no one can be certain of what direction the EU will take, it will at least move forward as a unit."

According the below linked Newsday piece?
The group, Elmont Against the Megamall, has financial connections to California and Virginia and distant connections to Republicans …..
Something VERY Interesting is going on here….
Democratic Governor Andrew Cuomo took a hit on Amazon leaving Long Island City, in Queens , NYC….
This group (That no one knows about) all of the sudden start’s spending over a half millions dollars against the Belmont Islanders project?…., huh?
In September 2018, Elmont Against the Megamall paid $346,000 to The Crux Group, the West Hollywood company. In October 2018, the community group paid another $34,000 to Crux, and in December 2018 it paid the firm an additional $102,000, state filings show.
“We believe this project is too big for the community, period. It will overrun the community with traffic from outside Elmont, turning a bad traffic situation into a living nightmare,” said Howard Kushlan, co-founder and CEO of The Crux Group.
Kushlan would say only that he expresses the views of members of Elmont Against the Megamall.
The Belmont project is undergoing a lengthy environmental review process scheduled to be completed in June. Developers want to build a 19,000-seat arena, a 250-room hotel and 435,000 square feet of retail.
Jack Sterne, spokesman for Empire State Development, the state agency overseeing the Belmont project, questioned the legitimacy of Elmont Against the Megamall.
“It’s clear that this faceless ‘opposition group’ isn’t listening to the community, and exists solely to promote its own interests and peddle propaganda,” Sterne said. “Fortunately, the Elmont community is far too smart and engaged to be tricked by anonymous big-money interests,”
Local residents and some state lawmakers questioned how the group, which describes itself as a grassroots community organization, was able to raise so much money.
“Whoever is behind this is hiding behind the group name, and there’s nobody I can speak to about what their beliefs are,” said Jon Johnson, who sits on the 15-person Community Advisory Committee formed by ESD. The panel meets regularly to discuss issues related to the Belmont development….."

Wouldn’t he LOVE THAT!….
President Trump reiterated a threat to close the U.S.-Mexico border after a meeting at the White House on Tuesday, saying he stands ready to take drastic action if the country doesn’t do more to curb illegal immigration. He also railed against the U.S. immigration system and said he wants to “get rid” of immigration judges who hear migrants’ cases.
“Security is more important to me than trade,” Mr. Trump said when asked about the severe economic impact of closing the border. “We’ll have a strong border or we’ll have a closed border.”
The president spoke after meeting in the Oval Office with Jens Stoltenberg, the secretary general of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
Last week, Mr. Trump tweeted threats to close the border if Mexico doesn’t do more to cooperate with the U.S. and slow the flow of migrants. But the commander-in-chief appeared to shift that timeline Tuesday, saying Mexico is assisting the U.S. more than it was even a few days ago. The president said he’s still “totally prepared” to close the border if necessary.
Along with a list of frustrations over immigration, however, Mr. Trump included immigration judges. U.S. immigration court backlogs are at all-time highs , with not enough judges to adjudicate the cases. That problem was exacerbated by the government shutdown earlier this year.
“We need to get rid of chain migration, we need to get rid of catch and release and visa lottery, and we have to do something about asylum. And to be honest with you, have to get rid of judges,” Mr. Trump said in his laundry list of frustrations with the U.S. immigration system……"

The polling got it right…..
Attorney Lori Lightfoot defeated Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle in Tuesday’s election, making her Chicago’s first African-American female mayor, according to unofficial returns.
Lightfoot jumped out to an early lead over Preckwinkle, a longtime political power broker, and had what appeared to be an insurmountable lead.
Lightfoot, a former federal prosecutor making her first run for elected office, had 74 percent to Preckwinkle’s 26 percent, with nearly 83 percent of precincts reporting, according to unofficial vote totals.
A disappointed but upbeat-sounding Preckwinkle stepped to the microphone at her election gathering and thanked those who supported her unsuccessful run in Tuesday’s historic mayoral election.
“This may not be the outcome we wanted, but while I may be disappointed, I’m not disheartened,” Preckwinkle said. “For one thing this is clearly an historic night.”
Not long ago, two African-American women in a runoff for mayor would have been unthinkable, she said….."
Marlon Brando Would Have Been 95 Today: His 15 Best Movies Ranked,www.newsweek.com,David Sim,04-02-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsweek.com/marlon-brando-birthday-best-movies-ranked-1382836,"By David Sim and Eve Watling On 4/3/19 at 12:10 AM EDT
On what would have been his 95th birthday, Newsweek ranks Marlon Brando's 15 best movies according to data from Rotten Tomatoes, Metacritic and IMDb. Newsweek Share
Marlon Brando was born on April 3, 1924, in the city of Omaha, Nebraska. He took to acting naturally—his mother was an actress, he showed talent early on with spot-on impersonations, and had an early job working as a cinema usher. Despite his obvious talent, his childhood was marred by his parents’ alcoholism and a strained relationship with his father.
He dropped out of his military high school after clashing with the faculty, and was rejected from the Army due to a tricky knee. Instead, the teenager moved to New York to study theater. He honed his extraordinary acting talent under the wing of Stella Adler—she developed his naturalistic approach, which would go on to steer movie acting away from glossy theatrics toward a rough, emotional realism.
This determination to forge his own path got him accused of being “difficult” but it was soon clear the young actor was onto something special. His first film role was as a paraplegic in 1950’s The Men . On release, The New York Times wrote “Brando as the veteran who endures the most difficult time is so vividly real, dynamic and sensitive... Out of stiff and frozen silences he can lash into a passionate rage with the fearful and flailing frenzy of a taut cable suddenly cut. Or he can show the poignant tenderness of doctor with a child.”
HIs next role, as Stanley Kowalski in A Streetcar Named Desire , was one of his greatest. Brando had played the role previously on stage, and his sweaty, shirt-tearing performance catapulted him into fame and earned him a best actor nomination at the Oscars—the first of the four consecutive years he would be up for the award. His rebellious image was augmented by his part as a biker in 1953’s The Wild One , which kickstarted a spike in leather jacket sales.
On the Waterfront followed the following year, with Brando’s sensitive, partly-improvised acting finally earning him a Best Actor award. In what feels like miscasting today, he played the lead in the Old Hollywood musical Guys and Dolls , clashing with co-star Frank Sinatra.
He made his directorial debut with western One-Eyed Jacks , taking over the reins from original director Stanley Kubrick. The movie was panned, and Brando’s controversial behavior on his following movie Mutiny on the Bounty led some to question whether the actor was done with Hollywood.
The 1960s were not kind to the actor, who seemed only semi-committed to the poor roles he chose. Then came Frances Ford Coppola’s astonishing 1972 movie The Godfather , which would re-establish Brando’s reputation, winning him his second—and last—best actor award. Last Tango in Paris was also released that year, signaling that Brando had found an affinity with the New Wave auteurs that emerged at the dawn of the 1970s.
But other than his appearance in Superman , the decade wouldn’t give him another real success until he reunited with Coppola for Apocalypse Now in 1979. That would be the last of his really great movies—Brando died on July 1, 2004 of respiratory failure.
On what would have been his 95th birthday, Newsweek looks back over his incredible career, ranking his 15 best movies according to critical aggregation websites Rotten Tomatoes, Metacritic and IMDb. Prev Next

Corbin Smith 04.03.19 1:12 AM ET
E very time Trump comes up, my father gets angry. “He offends me to my core,” he says, barely keeping himself from screaming. It’s not about politics, really, so much as it is about the pure venom of the man . He is a revolting presence—preening, privileged from the womb, incompetent, greedy, hypocritical in manners subtle and gross. The Bush years were a nightmare, in some ways that Trump isn’t even close to touching, but Bush just doesn’t have the sickening aura that Trump carries in everything he does . For so many people, this bloviating buffoon being the president of the United States never quite stops being weird and aggravating. Entirely too much of the man seeps into too much of people’s lives, ruining or straining people’s familial relationships, making the news hard to watch, flooding your Facebook feed with his crap, day after day after day.
The sportswriter Rick Reilly has taken his frustration with Trump and written a book called Commander in Cheat: How Golf Explains Trump . The book is a middle-length examination of Trump’s relationship to golf—an index of wild stories about Trump on the links and his work as a golf course owner and operator. It’s a slight volume, 240 pages, but it is just filled back-to-front with story after story about Trump being a shithead in relation to the game of golf. That one man’s relationship to a single game can contain so much pestilence honestly takes the reader’s breath away. The sheer quantity of anecdotes is a twin monument to the horror of the man’s approach to life and his weird obsession with golf.
Reilly speaks to dozens of people who have played with Trump, who all say that he is a habitual cheater in ways both large and small. One time while he played with Mike Tirico, the ESPN announcer ( and fellow creep ), and after Tirico hit a nice wood over a hill and onto the fairway, Trump allegedly went ahead, picked up the ball and threw it in a bunker trap to deny Tirico the advantage. He takes mulligans constantly, and is said to hit several balls off the tee and just pick the one that went furthest. Caddies gave him the nickname “Pelé” on account of the sheer volume of times he has kicked the ball out of the rough. He gimmes a chip shot while playing with Reilly, a journalist who was playing with him for the express purpose of writing about the game in a book.
Trump is a pretty good golfer, especially for an older man, but he still lies about his accomplishments like a lunatic. He claims to have won 18 Club Championships—Reilly digs into this claim, discovers that most of them are seniors titles and the others are total horseshit. He says he has a 2.8 handicap, but everyone Reilly speaks to says it’s more like a 7 or an 8. His etiquette is terrible. He drives a cart everywhere on the course—even on the greens—as he famously loathes exercise. At courses he owns, Trump has a custom-made cart that goes twice as fast as all the other carts, so he can blow through the course as quickly as possible.
Speaking of Trump’s ownership prowess, it’s pretty bad. He steamrolls course architects, hacks, and high-end pros alike, preferring courses that are littered with fake waterfalls and overly-manicured greens that look nice but play dull. Winning on one of his courses is generally a matter of power off the tee, which is weird because his drive is the best part of Trump’s game. He has open contempt for basically any good business practice you can imagine. Reilly chronicles him not giving a damn about local environmental concerns, openly shortchanging contractors (he allegedly stiffs one guy to the tune of tens of thousands of dollars but the guy still votes for him, a too-clean metaphor if I’ve ever heard one), unleashing armies of lawyers to achieve his concept of what a golf course is supposed to look like. He hates when windmills are visible from his courses.
After buying property to develop in Scotland, Trump tries to buy all the houses in the line of sight of his course . When he is not able to do this, he tries to get the local government to exercise eminent domain on the homes, so he can bulldoze them and get that pristine sightline he has always dreamed of. This obviously does not work, and the owner of one of the houses, Michael Forbes, raises a massive Mexican flag as a gesture of solidarity, and tells Trump to stick his money up his ass. Trump then proceeds to insult Forbes over Twitter:
This goes on and on and on and on. The vast majority of Reilly’s book is filled with stories, one after another, that illustrate that Trump’s life in golf is a total nightmare, on and off the course. Reilly wrote this book with a sense of grand purpose. He dedicates it to “The Truth,” and claims that Trump’s golf malfeasance is the key to really understanding him. I suppose this might be the case: he is a narcissist and habitual liar who tries to bend Heaven and Earth to get his way, and his life in golf is a nice and tidy display of that.
But the window Reilly looks at Trump through is pretty apolitical—the virulent racism he utilizes to stir up the rubes isn’t really mentioned much, and the method by which his grifting got him to where he is goes mostly unexamined. The closest the book gets to digging into why someone might find him appealing at all is in his interviews with Tom Fazio, a prodigious course designer who dishes on his former employer at length, recognizing that he’s a weird guy and terrible president but saying he still likes him regardless, just because hanging out with him is so weird and fun. Reilly also tries to tie some of Trump’s shitty in-office decisions to golf, an exercise that is a real stretch. He suggests, for instance, that Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates were excluded from the travel ban list because Trump wants to operate courses there, when it probably had more to do with the United States’ longstanding regional alliances.
What Reilly’s book does express is the feeling of living through this time in America. I couldn’t read Rick losing his mind about Trump shitting all over the thing he loves without thinking of my dad listening to Trump saying some dumb crap on NPR and having a big blue vein bulging out of his head. Reilly loves golf—too much, honestly—and he believes that the game’s truth and beauty come from its embrace of fair-play camaraderie, and the pure pleasure of a stroll on a nice day. Trump’s golf life is a single-minded assault on all of these values that Reilly ascribes to the game. Like so many people in America right now, the thing he loves most in this world is getting sullied by this blowhard. Everyone without a red hat on has something that irks them about this guy, and reading Reilly bury his face in the poison that aggravates him most, suck in deep, and expel the hatred back onto the page is deeply cathartic."

Standing Athwart,therionorteline.com,Utah,04-02-2019,2019,4,https://therionorteline.com/2019/04/02/standing-athwart/,"“A conservative is someone who stands athwart history, yelling Stop, at a time when no one is inclined to do so, or to have much patience with those who so urge it.”
~ William F. Buckley, National Review (19 November 1955)
I’m in a pretty ugly and cynical mood these days, especially where politics is concerned. It seems to me we live in an age where we are about to begin paying for mistakes of the past…and I mean really paying for them.
Progressivism has stripped all meaning from America’s founding values and has effectively rendered worthless the status of being an American citizen. There was a time when we paid taxes for the privilege of being a citizen and those taxes went toward protecting the value of being a citizen – today, we are simply extorted to pay for things people want who do not value being American. In a way, we pay ransom to preserve fractions of the freedoms guaranteed in the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.
Every single aspect of the Bill of Rights is compromised, nullified or is currently under attack. From the First Amendment to the Tenth, our own government is in open violation of every single one.
We have decided, in our infinite wisdom, to expose all to moral hazard by extending the rights of citizens to non-citizens and equating people who pay no taxes or own no property to people who do, eliminating the value of actually being an American citizen. Like the old saying states, when everyone is special, no one is.
It has devolved to such a level that our elected officials, especially those from the Democrat party, openly scoff at the concerns of the citizens who pay the bills, deriding them as bigots, racists and xenophobes. If you express any concern for the decay of the country of your birth, you are immediatley described as evil.
And we allowed this. At best, we have allowed a loud, vocal minority to shout us down and at worst, there really is a majority of people who simply don’t care.
I tried to make a point about illegal immigration the other day – that people coming to the US with no knowledge of America’s history, the reasons it was founded, the painful transformation it has endured to attempt to live up to those founding values would logically have no affection, allegiance or loyalty to her – and then I realized that this not only describes illegal immigrants but what seems to be a growing segment of young American citizens. These people can’t discern the difference between fact and opinion and yet they vote and hold office without even the most basic understanding of what their vote means or what their role in a constitutional government means
The Internet promised to be the greatest tool for knowledge since the ancient library at Alexandria but instead, it gave us the ignorance of another Alexandria – Alexandria Ocasio Cortez. Not to pick on Che-quita Khrushchev, but she is the poster child for such mile wide and inch deep transient knowledge that google experts and scholars possess. Che-quita is just the most prominent current example of what Ronald Reagan said –“It isn’t so much that liberals are ignorant. It’s just that they know so many things that aren’t so.”
Comedian Flip Wilson created a famous skit about a crooked preacher who founded “The Church of What’s Happenin’ Now!” in which the rules were constantly bent to the benefit of the preacher’s own desires. Progressivism is nothing but the post-millennium version of that church. It is a church where only now matters, where relativism and ignorance are seen as values and destruction of Western Civilization is a virtue. Righteousness is defined as compliance with the destructive progressive agenda.
But there is s difference between being righteous and self-righteous. Being righteous means being morally right or justifiable; virtuous. Righteous people are validated by immutable principles, their actions are guided by them. Being self-righteous is defined as having or characterized by a certainty, especially an unfounded one, that one is totally correct or morally superior. Self-righteous people are guided by malleable propositions, not principles and define their “principles” to justify their actions.
Where the actions of righteous people are justified by their principles, self-righteous people justify their principles through their actions. Their actions are always approved because their motives are assumed to be the purest – even when they are not.
The progressive left has become all they once professed to hate. The only way they can exist in this environment of cognitive dissonance and hypocrisy is to “other” all who are non-progressive. Everybody else is evil, a Nazi, a racist and God only knows what else. They have succumbed so much to the self-love philosophy of “Gosh darn it” Stuart Smalley (Al Franken), they have come to only worship themselves and this church will continue to attract the weak minded because absent principles or morals, progressivism promises the seduction of always being right
The fatal flaw in this Church of Progressivism is that no moral superiority can be built on a foundation of amoral or immoral acts.
As we are witnessing at our southern border, nothing short of direct confrontation with the progressive agenda is going to work. It’s way past time to be standing athwart and yelling “Stop!”
God help us all."

Dahir,04-02-2019,2019,4,https://reason.com/archives/1995/07/01/sticker-shock,"On either side of the main entrance to the capitol building in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, are larger-than-life statues depicting men and women herded in masses, struggling for those oblique ideals that government art always seems to evoke: liberty and freedom and justice.

Crime History Media Music Congress Several years ago, Pennsylvania's lawmakers decided those white-stoned statues guarding the gates of liberty and freedom and justice were taking just a bit too much liberty in dangling their freedom for all to see. So they commissioned modern-day artists to plaster over the statues' private parts.
This year, Pennsylvania's lawmakers are involved in a new debate over a different kind of public exposure. As a result, they found themselves unwittingly exposed to other possibly offensive art: an anti-censorship activist attempting to regale them loudly with the naughty lyrics of number-one rapper and murder suspect Snoop Doggy Dogg during a debate over a new law that would outlaw selling recordings with warning labels to minors. This dispute has drawn the national attention and lobbying muscle of special interest groups and civil liberties advocates--and also splintered traditional liberals and fueled charges of racism from all sides.
Black-and-white ""Parental Advisory: Explicit Lyrics"" labels have been applied to albums by the recording industry itself for nearly a decade. But the labeling was only agreed to under public pressure, and with the understanding that the labels were informational, not a legal instrument to restrict sales. If this bill passes--and it seems likely to--it could change the ground rules not only in Pennsylvania, but in other states looking to follow suit.
Similar debates are already raging in at least four other states:
■ In Washington state, the Harmful Material to Minors bill would create ""adults only"" sections in music stores, and keep minors out of concerts where ""harmful recordings"" were performed.
■ In Louisiana, a $1,000 fine or six-month prison term could be handed down to violators of a proposed bill that would prohibit the sale or distribution of ""lyrics harmful to minors,"" with a minor defined as an unmarried person under the age of 17.
■ In New York, a bill proposed in March would prohibit the sale of music to minors with lyrics describing, advocating, or glamorizing suicide, sodomy, rape, incest, bestiality, sadomasochism, adultery, murder, violent racism, religious violence, morbid violence, or the illegal use of drugs or alcohol.
■ And in New Mexico, a bill currently in the state House's Judiciary Committee would make it illegal to expose minors to violent or sexually explicit material through media including pictures, sculptures, film, and music.
Such laws would be a serious blow to First Amendment rights. But beyond the legal and constitutional problems are more difficult questions about racism, the social responsibility of the megamillion-dollar recording industry, and the ever-increasing violence that plagues America's city streets and the teenagers who hang out there.
A floor vote on the Pennsylvania bill is expected sometime this fall in the state House of Representatives. It sailed through the Judiciary Committee 15-6 in February, and it can probably pass on the floor with the same margin of popularity.
The law, if passed, would create two new crimes in Pennsylvania. First, it would make it a crime for any store owner to knowingly sell a tape or compact disc with a parental warning label on it to anyone under 18 years old, unless the minor's parents were present. It would also make it a crime for a minor to misrepresent himself or herself as being 18 years old in order to buy music with a warning label. Anyone who sells the music to a minor would owe a $25 fine for the first offense and a $100 fine for each subsequent offense. Minors caught buying the music would be forced into 10 hours of community service.
Democratic state Rep. T.J. Rooney, the prime sponsor of the bill, says the measure would help curb ""youth violence that is undoubtedly fueled by the type of irresponsible stuff they hear in these recordings....I'm not dumb enough or naive enough to believe if this bill passes it will solve all our problems. But it's got to be part of the larger discussion.""
The discussion isn't just about whether any restriction of music sales is right. A larger question is: What music is being labelled, and who does the labeling?
""All the talk about this being unconstitutional is a bunch of crock,"" says Rooney. The Constitution safeguards the public against governmental powers. Since the state would have nothing to say about which recordings get slapped with a label, the state would not be acting as a censor, he says. ""It just drives the record industry nuts because we're using their own standards,"" Rooney chuckles.
To some degree, he's right. The unhappy task of self-censorship already falls on the recording industry. In 1985, under pressure from the National Parent-Teacher Association and the Parents Music Resource Center (led by now-Second Lady Tipper Gore), the recording industry agreed to voluntarily sticker music with violent or sexually explicit lyrics. The measure was meant to help parents decide what music may or may not be appropriate for their children to hear.
Now Rooney wants to use that same voluntary industry standard to regulate the sale of music, something that not only goes beyond the original intent of the labels, but in fact does exactly what the labeling was designed to prevent.
Legal history suggests the government can't base laws on industry standards and then claim it isn't compromising the Constitution. In a landmark 1970 case (which, coincidentally, was decided in Pennsylvania and prosecuted and lost by now-U.S. senator and presidential candidate Arlen Specter), the courts ruled that the movie industry's self-imposed rating system couldn't be adopted as a legal standard."

"The Economy Is Growing, But Many People Aren't Feeling the Benefits",www.governing.com,Liz Farmer,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.governing.com/topics/finance/gov-brookings-metro-monitor-inclusion-economy.html,"Finance The Economy Is Growing, But Many People Aren't Feeling the Benefits Median earnings, poverty and employment rates have stagnated, and racial gaps have worsened, according to a new Brookings report. Five cities, however, are bucking these trends. by Liz Farmer | April 3, 2019 AT 4:00 AM The racial gap in median earnings and poverty rates increased in many metro areas over the last decade. (AP/David Zalubowski) SPEED READ: The Brookings Institution released a new Metro Monitor report. Median earnings, poverty and employment rates largely recovered from the recession but have stagnated. Most of the progress in narrowing racial gaps is in employment rates, not median earnings or poverty rates.
In the decade since the Great Recession, most cities have recovered. But even in places that have bounced back -- some stronger than before -- many people are still struggling.
A new report by the Brookings Institution outlines how the economic expansion over the last decade has been a lopsided one marked by growing income inequality, wage stagnation and racial divides. RELATED The Economy Is Growing. These Workers' Paychecks Aren't. Think Income Inequality Is Bad? Retirement Inequality May Be Worse. Big Business Tax Breaks May Worsen Income Inequality Black and Out of Work: How the Recession Changed Government Employment The Income Gap Between Black and White Men Is Getting Worse The report's approach, says co-author Chad Shearer, is more holistic than most because it looks at not just growth and prosperity but how they translate to individuals.
“[America's] economic growth has benefitted some more than others,” he says, “so we think it’s important to focus on how inclusion metrics are changing by race and ethnicity.”
Inclusion metrics measure changes in median earnings, poverty and employment rates. Without accounting for race, those three metrics largely recovered from the recession by 2015, says Shearer, but they have stagnated since then.
For example, Tulsa, Okla.'s median wage increased by nearly 15 percent between 2010 and 2015 while its relative poverty declined by 5.4 percent. Between 2016 and 2017, its poverty rate still improved, but median earnings fell.
The main reason for this stagnation is that big increases in employment rates have usually come from job gains in low-paying sectors like retail and hospitality. While that’s a positive for job growth, particularly for lower-skilled workers, these jobs tend to have lower wages.
“So as you’re adding these jobs and improving your employment rate, you’re lowering your median earnings,” says Shearer. “That kind of job growth can be a drag on the inclusion indicator.” Racial Gaps
With respect to race, the Brookings report shows that dozens of places made progress in overall racial inclusivity over the last decade. But, the gains were largely limited to narrowing the racial gap between employment rates. The racial gap in median earnings decreased in as many areas as it increased; and the racial gap in poverty rates increased in 54 out of 100 metro areas.
Narrowing the prosperity gap between whites and people of color has proven to be one of the most elusive tasks over the last decade. Silicon Valley is a classic example.
The San Jose metro area scores among the nation's highest for growth in jobs, wages and economic output. But it scores dead last on racial inclusivity. When compared with people of color, whites in the region now earn nearly $9,000 more a year on average and have a lower poverty rate and unemployment rate.
It's not surprising then that nearly two-thirds of Bay Area residents say the quality of life there has worsened over the last five years, according to a recent poll . Outliers
A few places are bucking these trends.
The metro areas of Chattanooga and Knoxville, Tenn.; El Paso, Texas; and Los Angeles made consistent progress in all areas except entrepreneurship, according to Brookings. And Denver made across-the-board improvements for all types of economic growth -- the only metro area to achieve this over the past decade.
The five cities have at least one thing in common: They tend to attract younger workers and are in states that rank high in Fitch Rating’s measurements for working-age populations and productivity. Experts say growth in the working population -- particularly skilled labor -- is a key ingredient to economic growth. Looking Ahead
If cities want true, inclusive growth, Shearer says they need a long-term vision focused on making that happen through the development of industries that fuel growth.
Denver’s already thinking like that.
For the past three years, local officials collected public input and used those comments to draft their 20-year plan for inclusive growth . The latest draft was released this month and is heavily focused on promoting health and social equity through land use and zoning, housing affordability, mobility and community amenities. Among other things, the plan calls for increasing access to healthy food through community-supported agriculture, farmers’ markets and incentives to build grocery stores in so-called food deserts."
