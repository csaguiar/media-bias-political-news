London, April 6 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 6th Apr, 2019 ) :Championship leaders Norwich are closing in on promotion to the Premier League after thrashing QPR 4-0, while Leeds crashed to a damaging 1-0 loss at Birmingham on Saturday.
Teemu Pukki's brace plus goals by Emiliano Buendia and Marco Stiepermann sent Norwich seven points clear at the top .
The Canaries, who have now won eight successive league games, look odds-on to return to the top-flight after Leeds slumped to third place.
Birmingham's top scorer Che Adams had gone six games without a goal, but he ended that run on the half-hour mark to give the hosts, who had lost five in a row, a first win since their nine-point deduction.
Sheffield United leapfrogged Leeds back into the top two with a 1-0 win over Preston.
David McGoldrick scored the only goal in the 31st minute at Deepdale to put the Blades one point clear of Leeds .
Fourth-placed West Bromwich Albion's automatic promotion hopes were dealt a blow with a 2-0 defeat at struggling Millwall.
The Baggies had won three in a row but were behind when Ryan Tunnicliffe's shot evaded Sam Johnstone's weak attempted save.
Albion's Jay Rodriguez fired a penalty wide in the second half and seven minutes later Ahmed Heghazi, who was later sent off, deflected Ben Thompson 's cross into his own goal.
Bristol City remain in the play-off places, despite Anthony Pilkington's stoppage-time equaliser for Wigan in a 2-2 draw at Ashton Gate.
Aston Villa scored twice in stoppage time to make it six wins in a row and move up to fifth with a 3-1 win at Sheffield Wednesday.
Wednesday, unbeaten in 11 games since Steve Bruce took charge, were ahead after just seven minutes as Gary Hooper converted George Boyd's cross before John McGinn's fourth goal in his last four games levelled the scores.
Wednesday missed the chance to go ahead again from the spot as Steven Fletcher's penalty was saved by Jed Steer after 57 minutes. And Albert Adomah and Tammy Abraham's added-time strikes made the Owls pay the price .
Swansea piled the pressure on under-fire Middlesbrough manager Tony Pulis with a 3-1 win at the Liberty Stadium.
A sixth successive defeat continued a slide which has seen Boro slip out of the play-off places.
Collin Quaner's first-half double gave rock-bottom Ipswich a 2-1 win to leave Bolton eight points from safety.
Rotherham remain in the relegation zone but boosted their survival hopes with a 2-1 win over Nottingham Forest.
Hull extended their unbeaten home run to 11 matches with a 3-1 win against Reading , who are now just a point outside the bottom three.
Having drawn their last four matches 0-0, the first English side to do so since Arsenal in 2008-09, Stoke beat Blackburn 1-0 thanks to Peter Etebo's first-half goal. Facebook Twitter Google + Related Topics"
'Yellow vests' march again as government tries to regroup,www.urdupoint.com,,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.urdupoint.com/en/miscellaneous/yellow-vests-march-again-as-government-trie-587795.html,"'Yellow Vests' March Again As Government Tries To Regroup Umer Jamshaid 7 minutes ago Sat 06th April 2019 | 11:25 PM
Paris, April 6 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 6th Apr, 2019 ) :Thousands of ""yellow vest"" protesters marched Saturday for the 21st consecutive week to denounce French government policies, as the authorities prepare to unveil the results of a nationwide consultative exercise designed to address public grievances.
From Rouen in the north and Lyon in the southeast -- as well as the capital Paris -- protesters took to the streets carrying banners denouncing French President Emmanuel Macron. In the west, French and German activists joined forces on the border .
Some masked protestors clashed with police in Rouen , but there was nothing like the scale of violence seen in previous weeks' protests, such as the March 16 riots in Paris that saw luxury stores on the Champs-Elysees ransacked.
Interior ministry figures -- consistently dismissed as underestimates by the protesters -- put the turnout across France at 6,300 at 2:00 pm (1300 GMT) of which 3,100 were in Paris .
That was significantly down on the 282,000 who turned out for the first yellow vest rally in November last year -- but many of the remaining activists have made it clear they will keep marching until they get satisfaction from the government .
""What will get me to stop, is the resignation of ( Interior Minister Christophe) Castaner, because of the police violence,"" said Catherine, 59, a demonstrator in Paris .
Castaner has been heavily criticised both by yellow vest activists and opposition politicians for having played down reports of police violence despite growing numbers of serious injuries among protesters.
- Results of consultation - Next week, the government will announce the results of the ""Great National Debate"", a series of town hall meetings launched across France in January to take the temperature of the nation -- and get Emmanuel Macron's troubled presidency back on course.
The idea is to collate grievances and decide on solutions. Macron's office said the president would announce the first measures to be taken by the middle of April .
Many yellow vest activists have denounced the exercise as a smoke screen designed to take their movement off the streets.
And an opinion poll published Thursday by pollsters Delabre suggested that the public was not convinced either. Of 1,002 surveyed, 68 percent did not think that people's views would be taken into account; 79 percent did not think it would resolve the current political crisis.
The government received another setback last Thursday when France 's Constitutional Council struck down a measure that would have let authorities ban certain individuals from protesting.
It was a key element of the government 's plan to crack down on violence at ""yellow vest"" demonstrations, but the council, which rules on the validity of laws, said the proposal gave officials ""excessive latitude"".
A new law will nevertheless allow the authorities to impose heavy fines on people organising unauthorised demonstrations and for anyone covering their face during a protest .
France has been rocked by months of weekly Saturday protests by the yellow vests, which emerged over fuel taxes before snowballing into a broad revolt against Macron.
The protests have often degenerated into rioting and fierce clashes with police in Paris and other cities, often by far-left and far-right extremists wielding metal bars or slingshots. Facebook Twitter Google + Related Topics"
"President Trump Says Rep. Ilhan Omar is Anti-Israel, Jared Kushner is Key to Bringing Middle East Peace, in Speech to Republican Jewish Coalition",www.newsweek.com,Gillian Edevane,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsweek.com/president-trump-says-rep-ilhan-omar-anti-israel-jared-kushner-key-bringing-1388188,"On 4/6/19 at 4:35 PM EDT Share U.S.
During a free-flowing and often self-congratulatory speech Saturday at the Republican Jewish Coalition’s annual leadership conference, President Donald Trump slammed freshman representatives in Congress, accused asylum seekers of being “scam” artists and once again said his son-in-law Jared Kushner was the most qualified person to secure peace in the Middle East.
Over the course of the hour-long performance, Trump frequently went off-script, jumping from topic to topic while taking opportunities to drop names and insult his political critics and opponents.
'She Doesn't Like Israel'
During his opening remarks, Trump made disparaging comments about Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar.
""Special thanks to Representative Omar of Minnesota,"" joked Trump , adding ""Oh, I forgot. She doesn’t like Israel. I forgot. I’m so sorry.""
The quip came just one day after a man was arrested for threatening to murder Omar over spurious, conspiratorial claims that falsely paint her as an agent for the Muslim Brotherhood. (Omar has repeatedly caught Trump’s ire over her criticism of Israel’s treatment of Palestinians, as well as her progressive policy positions.)
He also lambasted Freshman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez for working as a bartender before running for Congress.
“Green New Deal! Proposed by a wonderful young bartender—29 years old,” he said, referring to Ocasio Cortez.
'Asylum Program is a Scam'
The president's comments regarding asylum seekers echoed the harsh remarks he made during a visit to the southern border city of Calexico, California, on Friday, denegrating migrants seeking to cross into the U.S. not as refugees, but con artists.
“The asylum program is a scam,” Trump said on Saturday. “Some of the roughest people that you’ve ever seen. People that look like they should be fighting for the UFC. They read a little page given by lawyers that are all over the place. They tell them what to say. You look at this guy, you say, wow, that’s a tough cookie.”
Trump expressed his disbelief that burly men with tattoos on their faces were truly in any peril back in their home countries. Instead, he told the audience, he believed these asylum seekers were the ones causing the trouble.
Peace in the Middle East
In regard to brokering peace between Israel and Palestinians, Trump assured the audience that his son-in-law Jared Kushner, who had no previous diplomatic or political experience, was the best person for the job.
“I would like to see peace in the Middle East. If those three can’t do it, you’ll never have it done,” Trump said, referring to Kushner, Israel advisor Jason Greenblatt and U.S. Ambassador to Israel David Friedman.
At one point, Trump touted his administration’s efforts to withdraw from the Iran-Nuclear deal, which was reached in 2015 with the United Nations Security Council and the European Union. The Obama-era pact offered Iran billions of dollars in sanctions relief on the condition that the country curb its nuclear program.
“We’re not gonna be fools anymore. Last year I withdrew us from one of the most dangerous, one-sided deals ever negotiated: the disastrous Iran-Nuclear deal,” he said, without providing evidence. “They wanted to kill Israel. They wanted to destroy Israel.”

TERROR ATTACK in Sweden: Right-Wing Politician BOMBED by far-left Antifa Extremists,dcgazette.com,505335761211,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://dcgazette.com/2019/terror-attack-in-sweden-right-wing-politician-bombed-by-far-left-antifa-extremists/,"TERROR ATTACK in Sweden: Right-Wing Politician BOMBED by far-left Antifa Extremists 04/06/2019
Guest post by Peter Imanuelsen , more commonly known as Peter Sweden
Early Monday morning yet another explosion took place in Sweden. The target of the attack was a family home belonging to a former parliamentary candidate for the right-wing nationalist Alternative for Sweden (AfS) party. The victim of the attack has given an exclusive interview to PeterSweden , reporting for The Gateway Pundit, bringing you the latest on this horrible attack.
The politician was at home with his three kids when the attack took place.
The upper part of his door was blown up, sending glass fragments all over the inside of his house. Thankfully he was with his children on the upper floor, but if anyone had been on ground level there would have been risk of serious harm.
Swedish police have concluded that it was a very powerful banger that was used in the attack, containing up to 100 grams of gunpowder. The police suspect that this is a hate crime, and are investigating if there is a political motive for the attack.
This is not the first time that this right-wing politician has been the victim of an attack. On the 22nd of March his car was vandalized and the words “Nazi” was sprayed on it. According to the man, he is almost certain that it was Antifa in the city of Lund that was behind it, but according to him, the police didn’t even investigate this vandalization of his car.
According to the politician, he is a victim of a terrorist attack committed by far-left extremists.
The political party that he was a candidate for, Alternative for Sweden, is a new, right-wing, nationalist party. They are against mass migration and anti-EU.
Europol data shows that 36 people were arrested for far-left terrorism in 2017. Far-left attacks like this are severely under-reported in the mainstream media.
Here is the exclusive interview given by the victim. It has been translated from Swedish.
You were recently the victim of an explosion on your house in Sweden. Can you explain what happened, is there major damage to your property?
AfS politician : The upper part of the door with paned windows was blown up. That caused shattered glass to fly in the whole house. If any of us had been in the ground floor, we would have been injured. Me and my three children were at home.
Do we know if this attack is politically motivated, if yes, do you have any suspicion on who is behind this?
AfS politician : They sprayed the words “Nazi” and other graffiti on the sides of my car on the 22nd of March, and all the tires had punctures in them. Yes, fairly sure that it was AFA Lund (Antifa). They have also sent other things to one of my colleagues.
Have you or any others from Alternative for Sweden had any form of threats against you from far-left extremists before?
AfS politician : Several from Alternative for Sweden, and people who have attended our open air meetings have been doxed
We know that in the US, Antifa have been labelled as terrorists. Is this a terrorist attack?
AfS politician : Definitely a terrorist attack, and the mainstream media, especially Sydsvenskan have toned it down.
How do you view this, is this an attack on democracy and freedom of speech? Is this an attempt to scare the right-wing movement in Sweden into silence?
AfS politician : Without a doubt this is a threat against democracy and freedom of speech. I am deeply worried for the future of Sweden.
How is your family and children doing after this attack?
AfS politician : Naturally they are shaken. The children were at home. Incredibly cowardly to attack a family with kids.
How do you view the political development in Sweden, especially considering what just happened?
AfS politician : The left is feeling cornered, and they are bringing forth their vanguard and the “good and just violence”. There is a mass awakening among people, and they are realizing that Sweden is collapsing on all fronts. The state is responding with oppression and censorship. Tragic.
Obviously the conservative politician is very concerned for his family’s safety."

agree that our system of government depends on an informed, participating citizenry. It can be hard enough to understand what Congress is doing, but it’s even harder to grasp how Congress operates.
And yet, rules that govern how things get done often determine what those things end up being. As such, it’s very important that Americans understand how the Senate majority just changed—and hopefully, improved—the process for debating the president’s nominations.
Republicans on Wednesday, in a pair of 51-48 votes almost entirely along party lines, revised one part of that process. The move will expedite the confirmation process for President Donald Trump’s district court nominees and sub-Cabinet posts at federal departments and agencies.
The Constitution doesn’t say much about this process, only that the president needs the Senate’s “advice and consent” before he can appoint someone he has nominated.
Constitution gives the Senate authority to establish “the rules of its proceedings.” In other words, the Constitution assigns this role to the Senate, but without telling the Senate how to do it.
The process of the Senate evaluating nominees and deciding whether to give its consent is often called the confirmation process, and it operated pretty smoothly for nearly two centuries.
But as the federal government grew in size and power, the appointment of those who lead it has become more important and, therefore, more contentious.
Though designed to be the weakest branch, the judiciary has in recent decades become the strongest. Its power to determine what our laws mean is magnified because judges do not have limited terms. Once they are appointed, they serve until they decide to leave, an average of nearly 25 years.
As a result, the judicial confirmation process has become particularly difficult. Until the past couple of decades, 96% of federal judges were confirmed without even a roll call, or recorded, vote, and 97% had no opposition at all.
Those days are gone.
Trump is making significantly more judicial nominations—and the Senate Judiciary Committee is holding hearings for far more of them—than under the previous five presidents.
Final confirmations by the full Senate, however, are off the pace. The cause is an organized campaign, utilizing several specific tactics, by Democrats and their liberal allies to make the rest of the process as slow and cumbersome as possible.
Senate Republicans have now neutralized one of those tactics.
Senate Rule 22 provides for a process to invoke cloture, or end debate, which is necessary before the Senate can vote on confirmation.
Even when the Senate votes to bring debate to a close, however, Rule 22 allows up to 30 more hours of debate.
Democrats had abused that part of the Rule 22 process. First, they refused to shorten that 30-hour period of debate even for nominations they didn’t intend to oppose. Second, they almost never actually went to the Senate floor and debated the nomination being considered.
just empty time, with the clock ticking for no purpose other than delaying the inevitable. Nominations that would have been confirmed in a few hours took several days.
Majority Leader Mitch McConnell gave Democrats a final opportunity to dial back such obstruction. The Kentucky Republican brought up a resolution to shorten post-cloture debate for most nominations with limits very similar to those the Senate voted 78-16 to adopt for the 113th Congress (2013-14).
Democrats supported those limits when they ran the Senate under President Barack Obama, but filibustered them now that they are the minority under Trump.
On Wednesday, McConnell achieved the same reform in a different way. He proposed lower limits on post-cloture debate, not in the form of a written resolution, but as a “point of order,” or a question of procedure that required an answer from the Senate’s presiding officer.
Senate then voted on whether to endorse the presiding officer’s decision. McConnell used this approach because it could not be stopped by a filibuster the way the resolution had been the day before.
Remember, that is the very last step before a final confirmation vote. The Senate has already voted, often overwhelmingly, that it wants to end debate. Making that final period of available debate a little shorter is not, in the big scheme of things, a significant step.
however, have a significant impact. When similar debate limits were in place in 2014, the Senate confirmed 89 judicial nominations, the second-highest annual total in American history.
Even if Democrats continue forcing the Senate to use the formal Rule 22 process to end debate, the Senate will be able to do so for more nominees in a shorter period of time.
Today, 142 positions across the federal judiciary are vacant, the highest number since June 1991. Of those vacancies, 90% are on the U.S. District Court, the lowest level of the judiciary, where every case must begin.
No business or organization could function properly if 17% of its workforce was absent, yet that is the condition of the federal judiciary today.
The bottom line is that the Senate’s process for considering nominations has become too divisive and subject to abuse. The judiciary, and the American people who depend on it, suffer as a result.
While controversies can arise about an individual nominee here or there, the process must be less cumbersome for the large majority, who should be easily confirmed.
Republicans have, in effect, opened one of the gates that have kept the process backed up. They need to seize this opportunity so that the government that Americans elected in 2016 can function as it should."

Biden's behavior may be unsettling, but I don't think it is either lewd or rude. People have differing senses of personal space. I am a short man. I find it unsettling when a tall man stands close to me so that I must arch my neck back to try to look him in the eye. I also find it unsettling when a tall woman insists on hugging me so that my nose ends up beside her breast.
Are these men and women rude? I don't think so. Some may described them as inconsiderate, but I would certainly not declare them ineligible for positions of public office or trust. Everyone does not have to share our idiosyncrasies for us to accept them. Reply Margaret H. Laing said 1 day, 2 hours ago
I'll agree with both of you, gentlemen -- I'd consider Biden unsettling and inconsiderate. However, I'm left wondering just how much shock must be involved to keep a woman from saying ""Hey, don't do that!"" Or a man, for that matter... We can all pronounce ""Don't do that"" and ""May I?"" easily enough, surely."

Scouting Reports from Brooks Baseball .
Corbin Burnes : Corbin Burnes has thrown 822 pitches that have been tracked by the PITCHf/x system between 2018 and 2019, including pitches thrown in the MLB Regular Season, the MLB Postseason and Spring Training. In 2019, he has relied primarily on his Fourseam Fastball (95mph) and Slider (88mph), also mixing in a Sinker (97mph) and Curve (80mph). He also rarely throws a Change (90mph).
His fourseam fastball is straight as an arrow, generates a high number of swings & misses compared to other pitchers' fourseamers, has some natural sinking action, results in somewhat more flyballs compared to other pitchers' fourseamers and has slightly above average velo. His slider generates an extremely high number of swings & misses compared to other pitchers' sliders, is an extreme flyball pitch compared to other pitchers' sliders, has short glove-side cut, is much harder than usual and has some two-plane movement. His sinker is basically never swung at and missed compared to other pitchers' sinkers, is thrown at a speed that's borderline unfair, results in more flyballs compared to other pitchers' sinkers, has less armside run than typical and has little sinking action compared to a true sinker. His curve is basically never swung at and missed compared to other pitchers' curves, results in more flyballs compared to other pitchers' curves and is slightly harder than usual. His change is thrown extremely hard, results in more flyballs compared to other pitchers' changeups and has a lot of backspin.
Sean's Note: Burnes, like Woodruff, was also broken in via the bullpen last season. He had an excellent year in 2018 with an ERA under 3.00. His first start in 2019, he struck out 12 Cardinals in five innings but allowed three homers in a no-decision. His slider and curve ball are plus pitches and he also has a mid to high 90's fastball.
Final Thoughts: The Cubs finally made some bullpen changes after another rough pitching performance. Carl Edwards was sent to AAA Iowa to try to figure things out. Mike Montgomery went on the injured list with shoulder fatigue. In their place, Alan Webster and Kyle Ryan come up to Chicago. Webster was good this spring and Ryan, acquired off waivers from the Twins, just got beat out by Randy Rosario for the final 'pen spot. Cole Hamels needs to have a good start after the short starting outings the last few games. Daniel Descalso moves up to the leadoff spot for the first time."

The first time on Laura.
*He fell head over heels when he saw her in the church Sainte-Claire d' Avignon. And just like that he lost his vocation for the priesthood. Laura reportedly was a vision to behold. There was one impediment to any relationship: she was married. Her husband, Hugues de Sade, happened to be an ancestor of the notorious Marquis de Sade. Laura died 21 years later almost certainly without any idea of Petrarch's passionate love for her. His intense feelings sublimated into some of the most famous love poems in world literature. Check out a sample below.
It was on that day when the sun’s ray
was darkened in pity for its Maker,
that I was captured, and did not defend myself,
because your lovely eyes had bound me, Lady.
It did not seem to me to be a time to guard myself
against Love’s blows: so I went on
confident, unsuspecting; from that, my troubles
started, amongst the public sorrows.
Love discovered me all weaponless,
and opened the way to the heart through the eyes,
which are made the passageways and doors of tears:
so that it seems to me it does him little honour
to wound me with his arrow, in that state,
he not showing his bow at all to you who are armed."

There's a lot we don't know about early human migration into America. As things are now, we won't be learning much more.
Bullshit. Kennewick man was DNA tested and both his Y-DNA haplogroup and mitochondrial DNA are both found uniquely now among native Americans (not anywhere else in the world) from southern Canada down to Patagonia. Anzick boy (3500 years older than Kennewick - roughly 13000 BP and the oldest Clovis burial) is exactly the same - related uniquely to native Americans - 80-90% of whom from Canada to Patagonia share those DNA parental markers. The same goes for every old remains that has been DNA tested rather than via some voodoo phrenology.
They all tell the same story - and trash every other bogus agenda-driven hypothesis. A small group (prob 100-200 people max) of ethnically mixed East Asian and Siberian crossed over Beringia from 30,000-18,000 years BP. At which point they were cut off from Eurasia forever - and that particular ethnic mix then disappeared in Eurasia. And they worked their way south in different waves over the next few thousand years and populated the Americas. Today's Inuit mostly come from a later migration wave. There is pre-Clovis archaeology scattered throughout the Americas but no remains."

Win at all costs , eh?
“I’m not running for president just to talk about making real structural change, I’m serious about getting it done. And part of getting it done means waking up to the reality of the United States Senate,” Warren said. “So let me be as clear as I can about this: When Democrats next have power, we should be bold. We are done with two sets of rules, one for the Republicans and one for the Democrats. And that means when the Democrats have the White House again, if Mitch McConnell tries to do what he did to President Obama and put small-minded partisanship ahead of solving the massive problems in this country, then we should get rid of the filibuster.”
Maybe the Republicans should beat her to the punch and eliminate it now. The Democrats have shown us time and time again that they will not honor old rules if they get in their way. Posted by Owen at 1608 hours No comments "
MPs discuss ways to achieve gender equality at CSW63,www.ipu.org,suroor,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.ipu.org/news/news-in-brief/2019-04/mps-discuss-ways-achieve-gender-equality-csw63,"MPs discuss ways to achieve gender equality at CSW63 MPs discuss ways to achieve gender equality at CSW63 MPs discuss ways to achieve gender equality at CSW63 News in brief
Watch the video
The IPU and UN Women held a joint parliamentary event at the 63rd Session of the Commission on the Status of Women (CSW63) on 13 March 2019 in New York. Participants at the event discussed ways of making social protection programmes more gender responsive.
The parliamentary event, Investing in gender equality: Parliaments ensuring social protection, public services and infrastructure deliver for women and girls , was attended by over 170 people, including three women Speakers from Namibia, Togo and Zimbabwe; 110 MPs from 35 countries, of which 100 were women; parliamentary staff; government officials; and representatives of international and non-governmental organizations.
Social protection programmes are crucial to creating a sustainable society: they protect people from poverty and assure the equal distribution of public services, such as health, water and sanitation. Unfortunately, they are often designed without taking women’s needs and changing roles into consideration and are based on outdated gender roles. Parliaments play an important role in ensuring that the programmes help women by allocating adequate resources to gender equality and by overseeing social protection programmes.
The parliamentary event aimed to share best practices of parliaments. Participants suggested four ways to make sure that social protection, public services and infrastructure could advance gender equality. First, MPs should promote the adoption of laws that give legal status to social protection programmes and to gender-responsive budgeting. Second, parliaments should carry out oversight to guarantee that the design and implementation of social protection, public services and infrastructure take into account women’s needs and realities and are adequately financed. Third, parliamentarians should engage more with citizens, especially women and young people, to build the political will to achieve gender equality, and should consult with women on public policy design. Fourth, parliaments themselves have to be gender equal by increasing the number of women MPs, ensuring women MPs are represented in leadership positions, and gender-mainstreaming structures in parliament.
The IPU also co-organized three side events on sexism and gender equality, all of which were well-attended with over 100 people at each. On 12 March, the IPU and the Permanent Mission of Finland to the United Nations organized an event, Sexism, Harassment and Violence against Women Parliamentarians . Participants took stock of the legal measures and policies taken to combat violence against women MPs and to share best practices. The event aimed to strengthen partnerships at global, regional and local levels, and to increase the impact of the work on this issue.
Two side events took place on 14 March. The first one, organized by the IPU, UN Women and the Permanent Missions of Trinidad and Tobago, Fiji, Albania and Canada, was called From Critical Mass to Gender Parity—Women in Decision-Making Do Make a Difference! Participants discussed how women leaders have brought about positive change, especially in social protection programmes and in eliminating gender-based violence.
The second side event, organized by the IPU, UN Women and the Permanent Missions of Trinidad and Tobago, was titled Data on Women in Politics: Getting to Equal? Using findings from the IPU's report, Women in Parliament and UN Women’s research into local government, participants examined the trends of women in politics."

Global contest announced by the World Future Council, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU), with the support of the Office of the UN Secretary-General's Envoy on Youth, the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and Youth Policy Labs.
On the eve of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) Youth Forum and the 140 th IPU Assembly, the World Future Council, the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), with the support of the Office of the United Nations Secretary-General’s Envoy on Youth, the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and Youth Policy Labs, have kicked off a global call for nominations to identify and honour the world’s most successful policies enabling youth empowerment.
Every year, the most visionary policies tackling humankind’s most pressing challenges are celebrated through the Future Policy Award (FPA) , the only global award that recognises policies for the benefit of present and future generations. The World Future Council has awarded this annual prize since 2010 in partnership with UN agencies and the IPU. Recognising that youth empowerment is critical to achieve the Agenda 2030 and address key sustainable development and justice challenges, the Future Policy Award 2019 will put the spotlight on policies that empower young people through decent and sustainable jobs as well as civic and political participation for sustainable development and peace.
Youth empowerment: key to achieving a fairer, more just and sustainable future
Today, there are 1.8 billion young people - the largest generation the world has ever seen. The majority of them live in the so-called developing world. They are almost three times as likely as adults to be unemployed. Yet young people embody the potential of a society and play a crucial role as key architects of the future of their families, communities and countries. Young people are on the frontlines of political and social change and have the power to renew cultures as well as maintain important traditions. With the multiple global challenges we face – climate change, unsustainable food systems, dramatic loss of biodiversity, water scarcity, growing inequalities, conflicts and much more - it is absolutely critical that youth empowerment is promoted and supported through inclusive, effective, inspiring and innovative laws and policies that promote their rights and speed up common action. It is also vital that youth voices are heard and that they meaningfully participate in the design, implementation and monitoring and evaluation of such laws and policies for example, through parliaments, civil society organizations, and other formal and informal means.
The award will highlight proven policies that effectively promote and scale up local, national and international youth empowerment solutions. We seek policies that advance the economic empowerment of young women and men in decent and sustainable jobs, for instance, youth skills development programmes that pave the way for youth to build the green economy we need. It also encompasses youth entrepreneurship or programmes targeting particularly marginalized groups including women. We also seek inspiring policy and legislative frameworks that enable much more civic engagement and political participation of youth. This includes, for instance, policies that promote enhanced youth representation in politics and decision-making, and enable the integration of youth at all levels of governance.
Representatives of international organizations, academia, non-governmental organizations, parliaments, government agencies, and others have until the 26th April to nominate exemplary policies through the online form (available in English, at http://bit.do/eNoZb ) or with a word version of the form (available on request, in English, French and Spanish, at: ). Winners will be selected by a high-level jury of experts and announced in October 2019 at an award ceremony in Belgrade, Serbia, during the 141 st IPU Assembly. For further information, please visit: https://www.worldfuturecouncil.org/p/2019-empowering-youth/ .
Youth at a crossroads
Achim Steiner, UNDP Administrator and Vice-Chair of the UN Sustainable Development Group says: “Youth are powerful agents of change, driving important conversations and actions today on critical issues like climate change, peace building, and social entrepreneurship. In recognition of this role, UNDP supports initiatives globally that recognize, promote, and support youth leadership, expanding civic space for youth and encouraging youth-led innovation.”
“At a time when world youth population is bigger than ever before, only 2.2 per cent of parliamentarians worldwide are under 30 years of age . This is just the tip of the iceberg of the youth political deficit. Representation is a source of strength. Laws and policies that empower youth and better include them in decision making results in better outcomes for people of all ages and future generations. This Future Policy Award is a timely opportunity to share and celebrate laws and policies that have proved successful. I call on you all to nominate your experiences not only for a chance to win the Award itself, but to inspire further action around the globe,” underlines Martin Chungong, Secretary General of the IPU.
“This year’s Future Policy Award will celebrate proven solutions that make youth empowerment a reality. The World Future Council is determined to work with its partners in order to identify and share the best policies for advancing decent and sustainable jobs and civic and political participation in the interest of sustainable development and peace. It is critical that we learn from policies that are already making an impact,’’ says Alexandra Wandel, Executive Director of the World Future Council.
“In the world there are 1.8 billion young people, the largest generation ever. Most of them live in developing countries where they tend to make up a large proportion of the population. This reason should be enough to understand the crucial importance of effective youth policies to promote young people’s meaningful political and civic engagement, as well as their economic empowerment and access to decent and green jobs,” says Ms. Jayathma Wickramanayake, United Nations Secretary-General’s Envoy on Youth.
The winners of the 2019 Future Policy Award will be celebrated at a high-level award ceremony at IPU’s 141st General Assembly in Belgrade (Serbia) in October 2019, convened by the World Future Council in partnership with IPU and UNDP, with the support of the Office of the United Nations Secretary-General's Envoy on Youth, the ILO, the Michael Otto Foundation, the Jua Foundation and Youth Policy Labs. The Award Ceremony typically brings together more than 200 decision-makers, including heads of state, ministers, permanent representatives, parliamentarians, youth, heads of international organisations and leading civil society organisations from across the world.

Just a reminder that we *used to* have a president – Barack Obama – we could all be proud of, who represented the best of American (and humanity); who was brilliant both intellectually and in terms of social intelligence; who had empathy and caring for people everywhere; who had integrity; who was intensely curious about the world around him; who deeply respected science and empirical evidence; etc, etc. Now, sad to say, we don’t have any of that – at least not in the White House, where we have the absolute worst of humanity – but still…this just-concluded Obama Foundation Town Hall Europe (see video, below) is a great reminder of what we can – and MUST – aspire to in our country’s leadership. It’s also just plain inspiring to sit and listen to both Barack Obama and also the impressive, talented young people at this forum. After watching this, I almost felt for a second like the slime of the past two years had been washed off a bit, and that maybe there’s still hope for humanity and the planet after all?

"According to Activate Virginia, Only 26% of Virginia House Dem Candidates – ALL Incumbents – Accept Dirty Dominion $$$",bluevirginia.us,lowkell,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://bluevirginia.us/2019/04/according-to-activate-virginia-only-26-of-virginia-house-dem-candidates-all-incumbents-accept-dirty-dominion,"Energy and Environment According to Activate Virginia, Only 26% of Virginia House Dem Candidates – ALL Incumbents – Accept Dirty Dominion $$$ The only VA House Dems still saying they'll accept Dominion $$$ are incumbents. Meanwhile, the Senate Dems still overwhelmingly take Dominion $$$. By 2
According to a survey conducted by Activate Virginia , only 25.77% of Virginia House Democratic candidates (including incumbents) accept campaign contributions from Dominion Energy. Another 15.46% have positions on this issue that are currently “unknown,” for whatever reason (note: they absolutely should state publicly where they are on this, for or against taking Dominion’s money). And a whopping 58.76% of Virginia House Democratic incumbents and candidates have stated that they will NOT take money from Dominion Energy (or Appalachian Power, which is also heavily fossil-fuel-powered).
As someone who’s been fighting Dominion Energy for years, and also asking candidates whether they’ll refuse to take Dominion’s money since at least 2009, those numbers are truly astounding. Consider that just a few years ago, this issue was barely even on the radar screen. So kudos to all the activists, including Activate Virginia founder Josh Stanfield – and also to folks like Michael Bills (who funds the group Clean Virginia , whose goal is to “Advance clean governance , clean energy , and clean competition by fighting monopoly utility corruption in Virginia politics”) and has pledged “his own money to fund candidates who swear off donations from Dominion Energy”— who have pushed Virginia House Democrats away from Dirty Dominion Dollars, and towards a focus on figuring out how to move rapidly to a clean energy economy.
With that, who are the Virginia Democratic House of Delegates candidates and incumbents who still accept Dirty (both environmentally and in terms of political corruption) Dominion Dollars? As it turns out, ZERO Virginia House Democratic candidates explicitly say that they will accept Dominion’s money. So the following list is ALL incumbents – 26 out of the 49 Virginia House Democratic caucus members. Del. David Reid (HD32) Del. Kathleen Murphy (HD34) Del. Ken Plum (HD36) Del. David Bulova (HD37) – UPDATE: Del. Bulova emailed me this afternoon to say, “I informed Dominion/APCO early last year that I would no longer be personally accepting money from them…I didn’t take anything from them in 2018, and I don’t plan to in the future as well. However, I also don’t believe in taking pledges — so this is just something I decided to do because I thought it was right.” Del. Vivian Watts (HD39) Del. Steve Heretick (HD79) Del. Matthew James (HD80) Del. John Bell (HD87) [ UPDATE : Del. Bell emailed me, “FYI, I have taken the Clean VA pledge and have told Dominion/APCO that I won’t accept donations from them and haven’t done so since 2017 (a total of 2 lifetime donations totaling $1K). I also introduced a bill this year which of course the republicans killed that would prohibit all contributions from publicly regulated monopolies.”] Del. Jay Jones (HD89) Del. Mike Mullin (HD93) Del. Cia Price (HD95)
Does the fact that these folks take money from Dominion impact their voting and/or positions on things like the Atlantic Coast Pipeline, you ask? Well, put it this way: if you look at my list of who supports/opposes the pipelines, you’ll see a *lot* of overlap with the names listed above (e.g., Delegates Reid, Delaney, Heretic, James, Lindsey, Ward, and Price support one or both pipelines, while several others – Delegates Bagby, Filler-Corn, Sickles, Herring, Watts, Jones, Aird, Torian, McQuinn, Carr, Mullin, Tyler, Bourne – are listed as unclear/neutral). Also note that three House patrons of the “Dominion Bill” (Delegates Bagby, Lindsey and Plum) continue to take Dominion $$$. So…yeah, there does seem to be a strong correlation here, the only question being whether it’s also causation.
I’m not sure exactly what to make of the VA House Dem candidates who won’t say and/or haven’t said what their positions are on this issue. Those folks include: Jennifer Woofter (HD22), Irina Khanin (HD29), Ann Ridgeway (HD30), Mark Wolfe (HD50), Rodney Willett (HD73), Len Myers (HD81), Alex Askew (HD85), Hassan Ahmad (HD87), Kecia Evans (HD88), Martha Mugler (HD91), Shelly Simonds (HD94), Mark Downey (HD96), Francis Edwards (HD99), Phil Hernandez (HD100). For whatever reason, we don’t know where these folks stand on whether or not to take Dominion $$$, but I’d argue that Democratic voters have the right to know this information, before they go to the polls on June 11.
Finally, thanks to all the candidates and incumbents who have pledged not to take money from Dominion Energy. Note that a large majority of candidates are refusing to take this money, while among incumbents, the “Class of 2017”“Blue Wave” folks are particularly strong on this issue, with Delegates Jennifer Carroll-Foy (HD2), Wendy Gooditis (HD10), Chris Hurst (HD12), Danica Roem (HD13), Kelly Fowler (HD21), Elizabeth Guzman (HD31), Kathy Tran (HD42), Lee Carter (HD50), Hala Ayala (HD51), Dawn Adams (HD68), and Schuyler VanValkenburg (HD72) all taking the pledge. Also note that “Class of 2017” Delegates Cheryl Turpin (HD85) and Debra Rodman (HD73), both of whom are now running for State Senate, also have taken the pledge, as has newly elected Del. Ibraheem Samirah (HD86). And thanks to incumbent, non-“Class of 2017” Delegates Sam Rasoul (HD11), Mark Keam (HD35), Kaye Kory (HD38), Paul Krizek (HD44), Mark Levine (HD45), Patrick Hope (HD47), Rip Sullivan (HD48), Alfonso Lopez (HD49) for also ditching Dirty Dominion Dollars. Nice job by all of these folks. And, of course, I encourage everyone else to join them.
P.S. I’m not sure if Josh Stanfield has finished up the State Senate candidates list, but as of right now, it looks like most if not all Senate Democratic Caucus members continue to accept Dominion money. The contrast with the House of Delegates Democrats is stark; why is that? Post Views: 965"
We Don’t Need the Mueller Report to Know. We’ve Witnessed the Crime.,bluevirginia.us,Andy Schmookler,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://bluevirginia.us/2019/04/we-dont-need-the-mueller-report-to-know-weve-witnessed-the-crime,"We Don’t Need the Mueller Report to Know. We’ve Witnessed the Crime. By 5
There are good reasons to care about getting the Mueller Report released to its intended audience—to the Congress, and thence to the American people.
But we – the American people — don’t need the Mueller Report to know that Trump has obstructed justice.
It is probable that when Congress and we see the Mueller Report, we will find that it points to the conclusion that Donald Trump has committed that crime – obstruction of justice — which we know, from the articles of impeachment brought against Richard Nixon, is an impeachable offense.
But we – the American people – already have been witnesses to more than enough to draw that conclusion, beyond a reasonable doubt.
Between what we’ve seen and heard from Trump himself, publicly, and what we’ve heard from very highly credible witnesses, we know that Trump has been trying continuously, in a myriad of ways, to hinder, stonewall, defeat – in a word, to obstruct – the investigation.
We’ve witnessed, for example, Trump Repeatedly calling the investigation a “Witch Hunt,” to discredit an investigation that was protect himself against the rule of law represented by this investigation that was legitimate and important, that threatened him, and that was headed by the man with perhaps America’s greatest reputation for investigative competence and integrity. Baselessly attacking America’s main instruments of law enforcement, including trying to ruin the FBI careers of witnesses against him. Getting Devin Nunes to serve the White House rather than fulfill the proper role of the Chair of the House Intelligence Committee/ Using pardons in an unprecedented way. Almost without exception, those Trump has chosen to pardon seem selected as a means to send messages to potential witnesses that they should stay quiet, that they can disobey a court order, or whatever it takes so long as they help protect him. (E.g. the court-defying Sherriff Arpaio; the campaign-finance-law-violating Dinesh d’Souza; and Dick Cheney’s aide Scooter Libby, who lied to federal investigators and obstructed justice.) Trump has turned the pardon power into a means for the head of a criminal gang to send messages to the gang’s members. The entirely credible testimony of James Comey – supported by a contemporaneous memorandum and a handful of credible witnesses – that Trump sought to get Comey to drop the investigation into Michael Flynn. Trump’s televised statement to Lester Holt that Comey was fired because of the “Russia thing,” which he also told the Russian Foreign Minister and the Russian ambassador in the Oval Office. Trump’s public (as well as private) excoriation of his Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, for having recused himself from that investigation, as required by Justice Department regulations, rather than staying where he could protect the President from the investigation. His reliably reported efforts to fire Mueller (blocked only by the White House counsel). Calling those who cooperated with federal law enforcement “rats,” while praising those like Manafort who impeded the investigation (even acting as a spy for the Trump team and lying to investigators in violation of his cooperation agreement). Appointing Bill Barr, who signaled in his unsolicited memo – a clear job application – that he would protect Trump from obstruction charges if he were Attorney General.
This is just a partial list of countless acts of obstruction that we ourselves have witnessed, and have heard of from entirely credible witnesses.
While each example is a scandal –some of them small, some of them major — all of them assembled together present an unambiguous picture of the President of the United States attempting to defeat this essential effort of the American legal system to hold the President accountable and uphold the rule of law.
Indeed, Trump has been so focused on protecting himself from the legitimate workings of the law, and so creative in coming up with ways to do so, that one would be hard put to come up with what more he could have done to hinder, discredit, defeat –obstruct — this legitimate investigation.
Yes, it would be good to have the Mueller Report, which we can assume does a masterful job of laying out for Congress all the facts relevant to rendering a judgment regarding Trump and the crime of obstruction of justice.
But let’s not forget that we don’t need that masterful presentation to tell us whether or not Trump is guilty of that crime, because ourselves have witnessed it."

by Cindy; Originally posted at VAPLAN
Over the last couple years, the Virginia Department of Corrections has made the news headlines, and not in a good way: There was the death of Jamycheal Mitchell while in the custody of the Hampton Roads Regional Jail, where he was being held awaiting mental health treatment after being arrested for stealing a Mountain Dew, a Snickers Bar, and a Zebra Cake, totalling $5.05. A woman also died in custody at the Virginia Correctional Center for Women, after her emergency grievance form begging for medical help was ignored. There was the report issued by Brian Moran , Secretary of Public Safety and Homeland Security, declaring that restraining children at the Shenandoah Valley Juvenile Center by placing mesh drool bags over their heads and taping them to chairs did not constitute abuse or neglect . There was a sudden policy pronouncement that banned women visiting prisons from wearing a tampon, which was retracted a week later after massive public outcry. There was an ACLU report about the extensive, long-term use of solitary confinement in Virginia prisons. There was a New York Times article about lactating female employees working at correctional facilities having to smuggle breast pump components into their workplace to get around oppressive security rules. Then there was the time Brian Moran had to apologize after sharing a Facebook post urging a boycott of Nike due to its support of Colin Kaepernick, whose protest kneel during an NFL game brought important attention to the issue of police brutality.
All these headlines have made many legislators, and activists too, give some serious thought to issues of criminal justice reform and prison reform. Delegate Kaye Kory (D-38), in particular, wanted to tackle the issue of access to feminine hygiene products for female inmates–which the inmates had to spend their limited funds to buy from the prison commissary. So she sponsored HB83 last year, which requires correctional facilities to provide such items without charge. The bill, surprisingly, passed the General Assembly unanimously. But in preparing to present this bill and subsequently in following up to verify that the facilities were actually implementing the policy, Delegate Kory visited a number of correctional facilities and met many female inmates.
She learned about an incredible nonprofit organization, Friends of Guest House , that helps women re-enter the community after incarceration. A couple weeks ago, they co-hosted a discussion on issues affecting women in the criminal justice system. They brought four formerly incarcerated women with them, to share their stories. I’d like to tell you a bit about them (my notes were a little messy, because I literally cried through almost the entire event):
Heidi was in a long-term abusive relationship with a man that beat her so regularly that she was in and out of the hospital constantly, with cuts, bruises, fractures, and broken bones. Each time she left with a prescription for painkillers. Like many victims of domestic abuse, she had lost or pushed away most of her close family and friends. So when she finally developed an addiction to those painkillers, she had no support network to turn to for help. Eventually, she was arrested on four charges of drug possession, and held on no bond. (Interestingly, she never actually possessed any drugs at the time of her arrest, just related paraphernalia–but after prosecutors told her they would hold her in custody while they waited for lab results on the paraphernalia, she agreed to a plea deal stipulating that they would find residue on the items.)
She described her detox this way: “You are stripped, and then left naked in an empty room, with no sheets on the bed (because you might use them to kill yourself), eating food with no utensils, for 7-10 days, and then at the end of those days, they determine if you’re ready to go into the general population.”
Because there are only a small number of female-only correctional facilities in Virginia, and as of June 2018, 6,700 women in jails and prisons, many women are incarcerated in formerly male-only facilities. To avoid the challenges of maintaining a co-ed facility, women in these prisons are often kept indoors in their cells throughout their incarceration. Heidi told us: “for 17 months, I didn’t see the sun. I worked from 11 pm to 6 am every day in the kitchen, for no pay, just for the reward of getting out of that box.”
Guest House helps women like Heidi who can’t go back to the home or community that led to their incarceration find a place where they can get a fresh start after their release. “The day I walked in, I was broken. I had no family, no friends, no toothbrush. They took me in and treated me kindly and unconditionally without judgement.”
The second woman, Cindy, had struggled for several years with painful dental problems; while she was waiting to be able to have major surgery to extract several teeth, she was given a prescription to percocet. She soon found herself addicted, and when the doctors finally cracked down on her prescriptions, she switched to heroine. At one point, she was in jail and pregnant–she had to give birth to her baby with one leg shackled to the delivery table. Later, during her post-partum period, she was kept sedated with psychiatric drugs day and night.
The third woman was Helenia. She grew up in the “projects” in Alexandria. Growing up, her mother ran a liquor house, driving to DC to buy alcohol which she then sold out of her house illegally. Helenia worked for her mom from a very young age. She said she has a 40 year history of experience with substance abuse. During her third time in prison, she received a scholarship that helped her commit to staying clean, and to set some goals for her life.
She’s quite a character, and her humor takes the hard edge off listening to her describe the challenges of life after incarceration. Helenia spent 18 months at Guest House after release from prison. She said you can meet all sorts of people there–lawyers, realtors, people running for office, even Delegates. “My whole Rolodex has changed!” When she started attending Howard University with the help of a scholarship she received, Guest House helped her with books and transportation to make sure she could succeed. But even as a student, when she applied for a job cleaning rooms on campus, she was told “due to your felony conviction, at this time you are not qualified for a job.” She left Howard for another college, and is close to completing a degree in social work and is hoping to start her own nonprofit agency helping women leaving prison to get vocational training.
The fourth woman arrived late to the event, because she was coming from her job as a professional chef. She’s made quite a success out of herself since being released. She went straight from prison into Guest House, and from there was able to get culinary training from the DC Central Kitchen , and now is working at the Old Ebbitt Grill . She said that she’s been able to get her record expunged in Maryland, but that it is much harder in Virginia–you can’t even apply until after probation is over. (A woman in the audience spoke up as well, mentioning that she was on probation following a DUI conviction five years earlier, and that she’d kept out of trouble ever since, had been steadily employed, and had been offered a dream job in North Carolina, which she couldn’t accept because probation prohibits her from moving.)
As I said, I cried through much of this event. It was both heartbreaking to hear the stories about the horrors of life in prison–and how easily these women’s lives went off track, often pushed by forces beyond their control; and also heartwarming to hear what incredible support and assistance and love they were able to receive from Guest House. But here’s the thing: Guest House’s residential program can only accommodate 26 women. That’s a tiny fraction of the number of women who need a place like this. The criminal justice system would be far more effective and create much safer communities if we put more effort and money behind making the entire system more rehabilitative, and focused more on re-entry and setting people up to succeed following incarceration.

Governor Northam Announces Release of Virginia’s Draft Chesapeake Bay Restoration Plan,bluevirginia.us,Blue Virginia,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://bluevirginia.us/2019/04/governor-northam-announces-release-of-virginias-draft-chesapeake-bay-restoration-plan,"Governor Northam Announces Release of Virginia’s Draft Chesapeake Bay Restoration Plan By 0
From Gov. Northam’s office:
RICHMOND —Governor Ralph Northam today released for public review and comment a new restoration plan for Virginia’s portion of the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries. The plan, referred to as the Phase III Watershed Implementation Plan, will guide local, state, and federal actions through 2025 and is designed to achieve the Commonwealth’s commitments to reduce nutrient and sediment pollution.
The Commonwealth has made significant progress in reducing pollution, and the Bay’s living resources are responding. Cleaner waters are supporting more fish and oysters and underwater grasses are rebounding. Continuing that progress will necessitate accelerated and more significant action by government, wastewater utilities, the agriculture industry, landowners and homeowners, lawn care companies, the general public, and many more. The Phase III Watershed Implementation Plan serves as a blueprint for action.
“We know that simply maintaining our current level of efforts will not get us across the finish line in time—that’s why my administration is committed to putting the Commonwealth on a solid path toward cleaner water and a fully restored Chesapeake Bay,” said Governor Northam . “Our plan identifies the additional deliberate, focused, and science-based actions necessary to meet our shared goals, and will serve as a roadmap for addressing pollution and cleaning up the Bay. Together, we can take specific steps to ensure that future generations of Virginians have the opportunity to enjoy our waterways, and build a healthier, more diverse economy with improved recreation and tourism opportunities, additional water-based industries, and more sustainable land uses.”
“This plan will ensure that Virginia achieves its pollution reduction goals no later than 2025 and prioritizes actions that are practical, cost-effective, and provide multiple benefits to the Commonwealth, whether that is flood control, coastal resilience, wildlife habitat or economic development,” said Secretary of Natural Resources Matthew J. Strickler .
“For the past year, we have engaged local planning district and regional commissions and soil and water conservation districts to guide development of our plan,” said Director of the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality David Paylor . “Their on-the-ground expertise and experience proved critical to preparing an effective plan.”
The public is invited to review the draft Phase III Watershed Implementation Plan and provide recommendations during the comment period. All comments received on or before June 7, 2019, will be considered. The draft Phase III Watershed Implementation Plan can be found here .
Secretary Strickler’s letter to the Environmental Protection Agency is available here .
A webinar will be held on May 13, 2019, at 9 a.m., and repeated at 6 p.m., to share information about the draft Phase III Watershed Implementation Plan. The webinar will provide an overview of the plan and provide information about the comment submittal process. During the webinar, the public is invited to ask questions, which will be answered in the order they are received as time allows. All questions will be compiled and addressed in a Frequently Asked Questions document that will be available with the final Watershed Implementation Plan. The webinar will be recorded and available for future viewing on DEQ website .

(My latest challenge to the conservatives) By
This is my weekly op/ed to run in my very red congressional district (VA-06).
Republicans might usefully ask themselves: “With whom – outside of the Republican camp – does our Party have a good relationship?”
Not with blacks , as the long-time Republican dog-whistles (since Nixon’s “Southern Strategy”) have given way to the clearly audible signals from Trump – signals heard well by former KKK Grand Wizard David Duke and his ilk. The White Supremacists have recognized with gratitude that Trump has released that old deep cultural current of racial enmity from the cage in which, after centuries, it had at last been placed.
Nor with Hispanics , who have been characterized as “rapists” and vicious gang members, and who have watched Republican policies deliberately tear Hispanic children from their parents.
Nor Muslims , whose proposed exclusion was a big applause line in Republican campaigns.
Nor with our long-time European friends and allies , who just in recent weeks have become open about their unhappiness and anger at the combination of insults and bullying and abandonment they’ve experienced lately from the Republican leader of the nation that used to be “the leader of the free world.”
And, for sure, not with American liberals and Democrats , whom Republicans have been treating like enemies since the early 90s.
The enmity across America’s political divide has not been a two-way street—until fairly recently. I am in a position to testify to this because I’ve been in continuous engagement with both conservatives and liberals for more than a quarter century, and I can say: the hostility of Republicans toward Democrats was quite evident for more than a decade before Democrats started returning that feeling.
On the right, the likes of Rush Limbaugh, Newt Gingrich, and Karl Rove toiled for years to lead their followers into ever more intense contempt and hostility toward Liberals. They taught that conservatives should not regard liberals as their decent fellow citizens with whom to work for the common good.
(Even in Shenandoah County, where I live, Democrats have experienced Republicans’ treating them with the attitude of, “We’re at war with you.” When Democrats have publicized plans for rallies – in downtown Woodstock – Republicans have arrived early to stand in the way of the Democrats’ effort to communicate with the public. Their political culture makes them feel free to express such enmity, rather than to respect the Democrats’ right to have their public say in our democratic process.)
In recent years, liberals have begun to recognize how much pleasure many people on the right derive from anything that makes liberals unhappy.
(One flagrant example is the “Coal Rollers” of a few years ago—the men who would go out of their way to fix up their pick-ups so that they’d belch lots and lots of black smoke. Worth doing for how unhappy it makes those environmentalist liberals. And then there’s this from Ann Coulter in one of her books: “You must outrage the enemy. If the liberal you’re arguing with doesn’t become speechless with sputtering, impotent rage, you’re not doing it right.” I know of no liberal who would speak that way about conservatives, or would command any audience if they did.)
Enmity toward various groups of people outside of their own “kind” seems the common denominator of Republican approaches to issues across the board.
Is this “spirit of enmity” a solution to the mystery I’ve been struggling with for some time? The mystery, namely, of how the people in the Republican base can look at the conduct of this President of the United States – despite his displaying so many of the vices our culture has taught us to abhor — and like what they see.
This idea came to me when I heard an astute political observer talking about why Trump’s base supports him on the wall. It’s not because they believe the wall is necessary, he said. Nor does it matter whether it will work. He proposed that it wasn’t about such practicalities at all. Rather, they like Trump’s dramatizing “The Wall” as a symbolic expression of their hostility to the people – people different from themselves – on the other side of the border.
The most fundamental moral issue in the human world might be stated “Love or Conflict.”
That seems to be Jesus’s message, when he says “Love they neighbor.” (Even if someone is your enemy, he says, him too you should love.) Rabbi Hillel says much the same: “That which is hateful to you, do not do to another.” So also with Buddha: “Radiate boundless love towards the entire world — …unhindered, without ill will, without enmity.”
So being possessed by a spirit of enmity is no small thing.
We began here with the question, “With whom – outside of the Republican camp – does your Party have a good relationship?”
If you are supporting a political force that is at odds with everybody else, doesn’t that suggest that in the choice of Love or Conflict, you’re making the wrong choices? Post Views: 201"
