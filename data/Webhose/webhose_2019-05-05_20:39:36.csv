Writing for the National Review, David French declared that “corporate gun control might be the worst threat to gun rights.”
Things are looking up on the government front regarding gun rights. Having Brett Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court helps ensure that draconian forms of gun control remain the fantasies of the left. Add to that “constitutional carry” is steadily spreading in the red states. Twelve states now allow concealed carry without a permit.
However, one looming threat to your constitutional right to bear arms that isn’t beholden to any kind of established oversight: Corporate gun control.
Corporations can kill financing for the gun industry, stifle free speech and isolate gun advocates on their social media platforms without direct repercussions. Unless Constitutionalists cease supporting these organizations, they will continue unabated.
This harkens back to the under-the-radar program by Former President Barack Obama and Former Attorney General Eric Holder called “Operation Choke Point.” The Obama admin would have the FDIC label gun retailers or any market they didn’t particularly like as ‘high risk’, which would prompt payment processors to stop providing services. It’s hard to think that this new threat from corporations wasn’t at least inspired by or even given impetus by this two commies.

A highly agitated Nancy Pelosi smacked the lectern during a press briefing Thursday while demanding the release of Trump’s tax returns as well as the Mueller’s report.
A House committee chairman formally demanded Wednesday that the IRS to turn over six years of President Trump’s personal tax returns, the first such demand for a sitting president’s tax information in 45 years.
White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said Thursday that the White House “is not interested in playing a bunch of political games like the Democrats in Congress clearly want to spend their time doing.”
Trump ‘doesn’t have any intention to release those returns,’ Sanders said, insisting, as the president has, that his returns are ‘under audit,’ and ‘he doesn’t anticipate that changing at any point anytime soon.’
“Show us the tax returns,’ the House Speaker demanded in reply, adding the House Democrats are ‘not walking away just because you say no the first time around.”
Pelosi recently refused to release her tax returns. Who would like to see how the Speaker’s salary of $223,500 has allowed for her net worth to grow to $120 million?

Our Turn: Frank D. Sánchez and Brandon Phivilay: R.I. taxpayers should fund more tuition,www.providencejournal.com,Frank D. Sánchez and Brandon Phivilay,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.providencejournal.com/opinion/20190405/our-turn-frank-d-sxe1nchez-and-brandon-phivilay-ri-taxpayers-should-fund-more-tuition,"By Frank D. Sánchez and Brandon Phivilay Friday Apr 5, 2019 at 11:02 PM
The number-one reason students drop out of college is because they can’t afford it. Many cite balancing the demands of studying with the long hours of working a job — or in some cases, multiple jobs — needed to pay tuition as the primary reason for their departure.
The two authors of this piece, the president of Rhode Island College and a full-time student who holds down two jobs to pay his way through school, are keenly aware of how challenging that balancing act can be for families. Gov. Gina Raimondo’s proposed expansion of the Rhode Island Promise Scholarship is key to getting more Rhode Island College students to Graduation Day and to preparing the workforce we need for today’s economy.
 We know that the cost of a college education is one of the single largest investments many families will make. Similarly, loans to pay for college will be the first significant debt many students will take on, and in many cases will stay with them well into adulthood. Higher education has long been a ticket to a stable middle-class lifestyle, but these skyrocketing costs have created a significant barrier to achieving it.
If enacted, Rhode Island Promise will help break down this barrier for Rhode Islanders by making the cost of a four-year Rhode Island College degree one of the most affordable in the nation at approximately $19,000.
 A college degree is often the start of a virtuous cycle because those who complete a four-year degree are much more likely to earn more throughout their lifetime and have children who also complete college. And yet, we both know of too many talented students who studied hard and still fell short of finishing their degree because they couldn’t pay for it.
 The Promise Scholarship would also help close the widening gap in Rhode Island’s workforce by producing more graduates with the types of four-year degrees employers look for when recruiting. With 65 percent of today’s jobs requiring at least a postsecondary degree, and with seven in ten Rhode Island College students staying in the Ocean State upon graduation, the scholarship will help more Rhode Island students cross the finish line prepared to compete for these high-skill jobs.
 Here’s how the Promise Scholarship at Rhode Island College would work:
 First, the proposal requires students to have real “skin in the game.” Students must pay tuition at RIC for their freshman and sophomore years. Qualifying students may not attend another college or university, including the Community College of Rhode Island, prior to enrolling at RIC.
 Second, students are required to apply for financial aid before they can receive the RIC Promise, making it a last-dollar scholarship that will cover remaining gaps in tuition after all possible aid resources have been exhausted.
 Third, and perhaps most importantly, students must demonstrate serious commitment in their first two years by maintaining a minimum GPA while carrying a full course load.
 We urge the General Assembly to approve this smart investment in Rhode Island’s future. We know well that every budget is the product of tough choices made amid competing demands. But we can think of no better way to invest a relatively small amount of the total state budget — roughly $3 million out of nearly $10 billion — than in providing the final piece of the puzzle that makes Graduation Day possible for hundreds of young Rhode Islanders.
 The students walking our campus today are working hard to fulfill dreams of becoming business owners, teachers, and nurses. Let’s make a relatively small investment in securing their futures that will pay dividends for our economy and our entire community over a generation.
 Frank D. Sánchez is the president of Rhode Island College. Brandon Phivilay is a freshman at Rhode Island College. He is an intended nursing major with a 4.0 GPA."
"Donald Trump, international criminal - Palmer Report",www.palmerreport.com,Tim Faulkner,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.palmerreport.com/analysis/international-criminal-trump-don/17211/,"Line
Following World War II, nations around the world came together to create a set of rules to establish human rights laws that cannot be violated, even during times of war. The Geneva Convention ensured and defined basic rights to all individuals. The treaties created at this time led to future international conventions in order to guarantee the rights and freedoms of a multitude of individuals. The 1951 Refugee Convention is a United Nations multilateral treaty that spells out exactly what constitutes a refugee.
This convention followed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948, which stated in Article 14 that “Everyone has the right to seek and to enjoy in other countries asylum from persecution.” Based on these proclamations, concerning the rights of individuals seeking asylum in foreign nations, it is clear that Donald Trump’s administration has been, and currently is, violating human rights on a wide scale basis.
While the number of refugees seeking asylum in America is certain to increase, this is partially due to the recent move by Trump to end American assistance to Central American countries. Despite the clear international laws in place, Trump has made clear that he is refusing to accept such necessary human rights agreements. While it should surprise absolutely nobody that Trump is willing to violate laws protecting human rights, it makes it that much more disgusting that he is doing this in order to enhance any justification for his illegal national emergency declaration at the southern border.
While meeting with patrol border agents in California on Friday, Trump made the statement that “The system is full. We can’t take you anymore. Whether it’s asylum, whether it’s anything you want, it’s illegal migration, we can’t take you anymore.” Trump continued, “Our country is full, our area’s full, the sector is full. We can’t take you anymore, I’m sorry, can’t happen. So turn around, that’s the way it is.” Not only is Trump blatantly ignoring the needs of desperate humans seeking refuge from terrible circumstances, he is also breaking international law by denying the rights of asylum seekers .

Boy did the ex ever make a mistake. That E4 did not have drive or discipline.
I would bet that it is at least in the double digits the number of people, who if cheated on would resort to violence (i.e spousal abuse or violence against the other).
If the military is serious about spousal abuse and if they want to keep their pipeline of workers/soldiers predictable, lower cost (no training wasted on people with charges against them) and workers working to their full pontential, they will not turn a blind eye.
One reason perhaps there was no violence in this case was that the E5 new the E4 was a pud and did not amount to much. So he could sit back over the next few years and enjoy the train wreck, while he moved on with a better woman. But is that typical?"

The year 1962 was actually in the midst of Khrushchev's brutal repression during which authorities forced many of the remaining churches in Russia to close. The number was reduced from 22,000 in 1959 to 13,008 in 1960 and to 7873 by 1965. So take your bigotry and false facts and shove it."

British Columbia bearing ‘brunt’ of impact from Huawei arrest: Horgan,www.nationalnewswatch.com,The Canadian Press,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalnewswatch.com/2019/04/05/british-columbia-bearing-brunt-of-impact-from-huawei-arrest-horgan-2/,"By The Canadian Press — Apr 5 2019
VANCOUVER — Premier John Horgan says British Columbia, as the country's gateway to Asia, is bearing the brunt of the impact of Canada's tense relationship with China over the arrest of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou.
Speaking at the Council of Forest Industries convention in Vancouver Friday, Horgan described Meng's arrest as ""profoundly regrettable,"" but adds ""extradition treaties are extradition treaties"" and he doesn't think the federal government had any other option.
Meng was arrested in Vancouver in December on a request from the United States, which wants her extradiated to face charges including conspiracy, fraud and obstruction.
Horgan says the province does have an option, and that's to continue to be aggressive and forward-looking when it comes to trade with Asia.
He says it's a critically important market and boosting innovation in export products will be a ticket to success, adding that the province has an opportunity to grow the market for engineered wood products.
B.C. does billions in trade with China and Horgan says he's confident that relationship remains in good shape.

"Masse swims to Canadian record, world-leading time at Canadian trials",www.nationalnewswatch.com,"Lori Ewing, The Canadian Press",04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalnewswatch.com/2019/04/05/masse-swims-to-canadian-record-world-leading-time-at-canadian-trials/,"By Lori Ewing, The Canadian Press — Apr 5 2019
TORONTO — With a victory and a spot on the world championship team already safely tucked in her figurative back pocket, Kylie Masse had nothing to lose.
The 23-year-old from LaSalle, Ont., broke her own Canadian record and touched the wall in the world's fastest time this year to win the 200-metre backstroke at the Canadian swimming trials on Friday.
""It does (mean a lot),"" Masse said of the world-leading time. ""It's nice to be at that mark this early in the season. I know what I'm capable of now and so I can just get back to work and continue to work on things to be even faster.""
Two days after she won the 100 backstroke — she's the reigning world champion and Olympic bronze medallist at that distance — Masse finished in two minutes 5.94 seconds at the Toronto Pan Am Sports Centre. Taylor Ruck of Kelowna, B.C., claimed the silver in 2:06.70.
""I wasn't expecting (the record), but I always want to try to go best times so I'm really happy with that time,"" Masse said. ""I think getting on the team in the 100 and having a good race in the 100 definitely gave me a nice confidence coming into the 200 and I just tried to be relaxed and stay in control.""
Markus Thormeyer of Vancouver won his third race in as many days, adding a victory in the 200 backstroke to his medal haul. Thormeyer won in 1:57.42, edging Cole Pratt of Calgary (1:58.07).
Maggie MacNeil of London, Ont., captured the women's 100 butterfly (57.04), while Rebecca Smith of Red Deer, Alta., was second (58.30).
Quadruple Olympic medallist Penny Oleksiak was third (58.61), meaning she won't swim that event, in which she won silver in 2016 in Rio, at the world championships. Oleksiak had qualified for the world team however earlier in the week.
The trials determine the Canadian team for the world championships later this summer in Gwangju, South Korea. Swimmers must finish first or second at the trials, plus be under the FINA A qualifying time in their event, to make the team.
The women's 200 backstroke was one of the marquee events of the evening, featuring the backstroke specialist Masse versus Ruck, an 18-year-old who captured a record eight medals at last year's Commonwealth Games in Australia.
""She has such a strong backstroke and I knew she would be right there, and it would be a tough race,"" Masse said of Ruck. ""So I was expecting her to go super fast. But if one of us goes fast it's only pushing the other person, so to be both of us together is pretty neat, and great for us as well.""
The two went through the first 50 metres in identical times, Ruck had a slight edge through 100 metres before Masse pulled away over the final 100.
Two days after setting a Canadian record in the 100 backstroke, Thormeyer narrowly missed the Canadian record of 1:57.34 in the 200 back.
""(The record) is always kind of in the back of my head,"" Thormeyer said. ""Missing it by a little bit kind of stings, but that's life I guess.""
Mackenzie Padington of Campbell River, B.C., won the women's 400 freestyle (4:08.82), narrowly beating Emma O'Croinin, a 15-year-old from Edmonton (4:09.11), who's the youngest swimmer to make the world team so far.
""I'm a swimmer that goes out for it. She was the one who pushed back the most,"" Padington said of the stiff competition posed by O'Croinin. ""I have never personally met her but I am so proud of her. Two years ago was my breakout year. Now she's the young one and I'm so happy.""
""She is four years younger than me. We don't see kids her age go under 4:10. She has so much potential. It's quite amazing.""
O'Croinin was similarly amazed.
""I'm kind of shocked. I just wanted to go out there and see what I could do. I'm really happy with the way it turned out,"" she said.
Jeremy Bagshaw of Victoria won the men's 400 freestyle in 3:50.96.
Para swimmer Alec Elliot collected a pair of gold medals, winning both the men's 100 butterfly and 400 freestyle multi-class races.
Para swimmer Aurelie Rivard won the women's 400 freestyle.
Earlier, Tess Routliffe won the multi-class para 50 butterfly, while Etienne Boutin-Cote won the men's event. Samantha Ryan won the para 100 butterfly.
Some 600 swimmers are competing this week for spots on six Canadian teams: the FINA world championships, the world para championships, the Pan American Games, the Parapan American Games, the FISU Summer Universiade, and the FINA world junior championships.
The teams will be named Sunday evening.
