""The more data we produce, the more digital detritus we throw out there,"" she says. And someone will need to clean it up. Think Facebook content moderators and YouTube video screeners. ""As good as AI is and will be, it will require these very human skills of discretion to be able to do that work,"" says Gorbis. But these jobs come with issues. Though they are physically safer than the manufacturing jobs of the 20th century, they can be highly stressful, exhausting and even lead to PTSD, as The Verge's Casey Newton reports in an investigation of the lives of Facebook's moderators. Those digital janitors earn $28,200 a year. And such workers are typically hired on a part-time or contract basis. When millennials are earning $15 an hour, or $31,000 a year, they are regarded as middle wage, even though that would not be sufficient to support the accouterments of the traditional middle-class American lifestyle. But, but, but: These don't have to be ""bad jobs"" forever for millennials, Gorbis notes. Manufacturing jobs seemed like bad jobs before labor unions and regulators stepped in to improve pay and conditions, she says. ""We made them into good jobs."" The bottom line: In the future, ""I think there will likely still be lots of jobs for people with less education,"" says Jed Kolko, chief economist at Indeed. ""The bigger questions are: What will those jobs pay? Will they have benefits and a predictable schedule? Will they lead to careers?"" "
Even More Trouble Lurks For Anthony Weiner,townhall.com,Beth Baumann,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://townhall.com/tipsheet/bethbaumann/2019/04/06/even-more-trouble-lurks-for-anthony-weiner-n2544373,"Even More Trouble Lurks For Anthony Weiner Share Share Tweet Source: AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File
Former Congressman Anthony Weiner (D-NY) is finishing up the end of his 21-month sentence for illicit contact with a 15-year-old girl. Weiner has been labeled a Level 1 offender, meaning he's unlikely to reoffend. A judge ordered him to register as a sex offender for a minimum of 20 years, the Associated Press reported.
The sex offender registration process requires him to verify his address every year. If he moves, he has to notify the state of his new address within 10 days of moving. Weiner also has to visit a police station every three years to have a new picture taken.
Although Weiner will be a registered sex offender, he won't show up in New York's online data base. The reason? His Level 1 low-level designation means he will only show up when a person calls the toll free number.
According to CNN , level three sex offenders – the highest designation – authorities are required to provide the public with the person's address and he or she is required to register as a sex offender for life.
Back in 2017 Weiner pleaded guilty to sending lewd pictures to a 15-year-old. He had a similar incident occur back in 2011, when he accidentally tweeted inappropriate pictures of his crotch. The pictures were meant for a college student. At that time he resigned from Congress. Recommended The Democratic Field Is A Rainbow Of Sameness Derek Hunter
He tried to revive his political career in 2013 when he ran for New York City mayor. His race ended when, once again, it was revealed that he was having lewd conversations with various women.
Weiner is scheduled to be released on May 14th. He faces three years of court-ordered supervision.
The former Congressman did not appear at Friday's hearing."

"As season winds down, things are looking up for Celtics",www.providencejournal.com,Jim Fenton The Brockton Enterprise,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.providencejournal.com/sports/20190406/as-season-winds-down-things-are-looking-up-for-celtics,"As season winds down, things are looking up for Celtics By Jim FentonThe Brockton Enterprise Saturday Apr 6, 2019 at 6:50 PM Apr 6, 2019 at 6:50 PM
Their home opener was played on Oct. 16 under a bright spotlight as the first game on the NBA schedule.
The Celtics hosted the Philadelphia 76ers on national television in a game that was viewed as a possible preview of the Eastern Conference finals.
Nearly six months later, the Celtics draw the curtain on their 41-game regular-season home schedule on Sunday night on the verge of clinching the fourth seed in the conference.
It is not exactly where the Celtics figured to be when the season got going back in mid-October, but with the playoffs set to begin next weekend, there appears to be hope on the horizon.
After going on a roller-coaster ride for much of this disappointing season, the Celtics seem to be going in the right direction at the most important time of the year.
They have won five of six games, including a pair of important matchups against the Indiana Pacers, and are showing various signs of straightening out problem areas that have lingered throughout the fall and winter.
The Celtics (48-32) can close the deal on the No. 4 seed with a win over the improved Orlando Magic (7:35 p.m., TV: NBC Sports Boston; radio: WBZ-98.5 FM) in the home finale. The game could even turn out to be meaningless for the Celtics if the Pacers lose at home to the Brooklyn Nets in a 5 p.m. start.
The magic number for being the No. 4 seed was reduced to one on Friday night when the Celtics put together a complete game in rolling by the Pacers, 117-97.
“This was one of our better games this season by far,’’ Al Horford told reporters after the win in Indiana.
Since going on a four-game losing streak in March, the Celtics are 5-1 with the only loss coming against the Nets when both Horford and Kyrie Irving sat out.
They started the run with a victory over the lottery-bound Cleveland Cavaliers and defeated the Heat and Pacers twice each.
The Celtics have looked like they were getting their act together on several occasions in the past, but something feels different about this upswing.
Gordon Hayward is starting to play like the All Star he was with the Utah Jazz, which resulted in a four-year, $128-million contract Boston. He then suffered a gruesome injury that ended his season on Opening Night in October 2017.
In the Friday night win over the Pacers, Hayward was 9-for-9 and scored 21 points in 26 minutes. According to the Celtics, he is the team’s first player to have at least 20 points without missing a shot since Kevin McHale on March 2, 1986.
The Celtics have won 17 of the 20 games in which Hayward has scored at least 15 points.
Since returning from a concussion on March 24, Hayward is averaging 16.4 points on 40-for-68 shooting and has been more aggressive getting to the basket and creating opportunities.
“That’s a lot of what I did when I was in Utah, finishing in the lane with different types of finishes off one foot, two feet, fade-back, things like that,’’ Hayward told reporters on Friday night. “It’s coming together nicely and I have to continue to attack and get to the line.’’
An improved Hayward to go along with Jaylen Brown and Terry Rozier plus either Marcus Morris or Aron Baynes (depending on who starts) would give the Celtics a dangerous bench in the playoffs.
Jayson Tatum is also playing a more aggressive brand of basketball in this stretch, and the move by coach Brad Stevens to insert Baynes into the starting lineup has paid off.
With Baynes and Horford together up front, the Celtics defense has been noticeably improved. Teams had scored at least 100 points in 14 straight before the Pacers were held to 97, the first time the Celtics held anyone below 100 since the Golden State Warriors had 95 on March 5.
Unless the 76ers collapse in their final games, the Celtics and Pacers will meet in the playoffs starting next Saturday or Sunday. Wrapping up the No. 4 seed on Sunday will allow the Celtics to rest everyone in Tuesday’s finale at Washington. Never miss a story

The Origin of The Feces – President Trump Smartly Draws Attention to Beginning of Russian Conspiracy Effort… | The Last Refuge,theconservativetreehouse.com,,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://theconservativetreehouse.com/2019/04/06/the-origin-of-the-feces-president-trump-smartly-draws-attention-to-beginning-of-russian-conspiracy-effort/,"Posted on April 6, 2019 by sundance
In a series of tweets today President Trump smartly directs attention to the origin of the operation to create the Russian Collusion-Conspiracy narrative, calling it a “con job”, and “made up fraud”.
Calling attention to the origin of the fraud avoids the justification trap we have previously discussed. Additionally, focusing on the beginning of the corrupt operation helps contrast the pending conclusions as released by AG Bill Barr and the Mueller report findings.
The Trump-Russia investigation was based on a fraudulent premise, purposed for use by a weaponized and politicized intelligence apparatus including the CIA, DoS, DOJ and FBI. It is also the origin of the feces that holds the greatest risk to those who constructed the surveillance operation.
President Trump avoids the issue(s) surrounding how President Obama and high-ranking intelligence officials (Comey, Clapper, Brennan, Yates), intentionally lied and misrepresented themselves to Trump and the transition team, and instead focuses directly on the origin of their fraud.
Some of the intentional misinformation stems from intelligence officials telling direct lies (ex. telling President-elect, and President Trump he was not under investigation). Other aspects were lies of omission surrounding the Steele Dossier during the January 6th, 2017, intelligence briefing session with the President-elect in Trump Tower.
There were many misleading and false statements, with varying scales of severity, during the period from November 9th, 2016, through 2017. The FBI, DOJ, ODNI, CIA and intelligence officials were intentionally not being direct and honest with President Trump and key members of his new administration. Obviously their lack of honesty was a serious issue, and in some cases had serious ramifications.
The expressed finding by Robert Mueller’s two-year probe of ‘no Trump-Russia collusion, no Trump-Russia conspiracy, and no Trump-Russia obstruction’ has led to some hindsight reviews by media voices where anger surfaces about the now visible deception.
However, there is also a trap laid here and Democrats were hoping outraged voices would walk straight into it. Obviously President Trump is avoiding that bait by going directly to the origin of their operation.
At 12:15pm on January 20th, 2017, Obama’s outgoing National Security Advisor Susan Rice wrote a memo-to-self . Many people have called this her “CYA” (cover your ass) memo, from the position that Susan Rice was protecting herself from consequences if the scheme against President Trump was discovered. Here’s the email :
On January 5, following a briefing by IC leadership on Russian hacking during the 2016 Presidential election, President Obama had a brief follow-on conversation with FBI Director Jim Corney and Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates in the Oval Office. Vice President Biden and I were also present.
President Obama began the conversation by stressing his continued commitment to ensuring that every aspect of this issue is handled by the Intelligence and law enforcement communities “ by the book “.
The President stressed that he is not asking about, initiating or instructing anything from a law enforcement perspective. He reiterated that our law enforcement team needs to proceed as it normally would by the book.
From a national security perspective, however, President Obama said he wants to be sure that, as we engage with the incoming team, we are mindful to ascertain if there is any reason that we cannot share information fully as it relates to Russia.
[Redacted Classified Section of Unknown length]
The President asked Corney to inform him if anything changes in the next few weeks that should affect how we share classified information with the incoming team. Corney said he would.
Susan Rice ~ ( pdf link )
As stated, many have looked at this as a “CYA” memo , but that’s not what this is.
This is a justification memo, written by an outgoing National Security Advisor Susan Rice to document why there have been multiple false and misleading statements given to the incoming President Trump and all of his officials.
This is not a “CYA” memo, this is a justification memo for use AFTER the Trump-Russia collusion/conspiracy narrative collapsed; if the impeachment effort failed.
The “ By The Book ” aspect refers to President Obama and Susan Rice being told by CIA Director John Brennan, FBI Director James Comey, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, and Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates, that President Trump was the subject of an active counterintelligence investigation to determine if he was under the influence of the Russian government.
Even the timing of the memo, written 15 minutes prior to the end of the Obama administration, is ex-post-facto useful as evidence of the author’s intent.
Put aside the nonsense aspect to the origination of the investigation for a moment; that part doesn’t apply here…. Accept their position ‘ as if’ it is substantive.
We are talking about Brennan, Comey, Clapper and Yates telling President Obama and NSA Susan Rice that President-elect Trump is under a counterintelligence investigation where the suspicion is that Donald J Trump is an agent of a foreign power.
Under that auspices (fraudulent though it may be) the incoming President is a counterintelligence investigation target. A potentially compromised Russian asset. Under this auspices all of the officials would be permitted to lie and mislead their target, so long as they did so “By The Book.”
That’s their justification for a lengthy series of lies and false statements.
That’s why FBI Director James Comey can lie to the President and tell him he’s not the target of the ongoing Russia investigation. That’s the justification for keeping the accusations inside the Steele Dossier (remember, the Dossier is evidence) from the President-elect. That’s the justification for all of the officials to lie to President Trump, and even mislead the media if needed.
The Susan Rice email is one big Justification Letter ; setting the stage for all of the participants to have a plausible reason for lies to anyone and everyone.
Call out John Brennan for telling Harry Reid about the Steele Dossier during his gang-of-eight briefing, but not telling Go8 member Devin Nunes about it. Brennan escapes by saying Nunes was on the Trump transition team; and briefing a conflicted politician on the dossier would have compromised the FBI investigation. See how that works?
Call out James Comey for lying to President-elect Trump during the January 6th Trump Tower meeting…. Comey escapes by saying Trump was a target of the FBI investigation for potential compromise as a Russian asset; informing the target of the evidence against him would have compromised the investigation. See how that works?
Every lie, every omission, every false and/or misleading statement, must first be filtered through the “By The Book” prism of Trump being considered a Russian asset. This is the justification trap democrats are waiting to exploit for maximum damage and diminishment of counter attack.
The “ By the Book ” justification, where every action could have been taken because Trump might have been an actual Russian operative, is the weapon under the camouflage tarp as the radical left lures-in their political opposition. They shrug their shoulders and say in condescending voice: ‘ well, we didn’t know; we had to be prudent ‘, etc.
Getting outraged about the Obama administration’s lies, misstatements and fabrications can backfire if you don’t first think about it from their constructed frame-of-reference.
The ‘By-the-Book’ framework is based on a false-premise; but the action, just about any action, taken to mislead (even undermine) the incoming administration is excusable under this carefully crafted justification memo. That’s exactly why Susan Rice wrote it; and each of the participating members knows they can use it, when needed.
The way to get around the legal and political defense inside this justification memo is to ignore the activity of those protected by it and go directly to the origin of how they created that false premise in the first place:
♦ Prove the July 31st, 2016, Crossfire Hurricane operation originated from fraud by exposing the CIA operation that created the originating “Electronic Communication” memo. Declassify that two-page “EC” document that Brennan gave to Comey.
♦ Reveal the November 2015 through April 2016 FISA-702 search query abuse by declassifying the April 2017 court opinion written by FISC Presiding Judge Rosemary Collyer. Show the FBI contractors behind the 85% fraudulent search queries. [Crowdstrike? Fusion-GPS? Nellie Ohr?]
♦ Subpoena former DOJ-NSD (National Security Division) head John Carlin , or haul him in front of a grand jury, and get his testimony about why he hid the abuse from the FISA court in October 2016; why the DOJ-NSD rushed the Carter Page application to beat NSA Director Admiral Mike Rogers to the FISA court ; and why Carlin quit immediately thereafter. Squeeze this bastard’s nuts in the proverbial legal vice.
♦ Prove the Carter Page FISA application (October 2016) was fraudulent and based on deceptions to the FISA Court. Declassify the entire document, and release the transcripts of those who signed the application(s); and/or depose those who have not yet testified.
♦ Release all of the Lisa Page and Peter Strzok text messages without redactions . Let sunlight pour in on the actual conversation(s) that were taking place when Crossfire Hurricane (July ’16) and the FISA Application (Oct ’16) were taking place.
♦ Release all of Bruce Ohr 302’s, FBI notes from interviews and debriefing sessions, and other relevant documents associated with the interviews of Bruce Ohr and his internal communications. Including exculpatory evidence that Bruce Ohr may have shared with FBI Agent Joseph Pientka. [And get a deposition from this Pientka fella]
In short, avoid the “ justification trap ” by ignoring the downstream activity (stemming as a result of the fraudulent origin), and focus on revealing the origin of the fraud. Share this:"

Who would get them and why? Would someone with two slaves in his or her family three get half of what someone with four slaves in his or her family tree receives? Would middle-class and poor blacks get the same? Would reparations be in lieu of affirmative-action programs, which also purport to right historic injustices, or in addition to them?
Those are just the start of the questions, but unlike in past decades, many if not most “civil rights” and black nationalist groups have joined forces to make “reparations” a legitimate item on the racial progress agenda. Gone are the luminaries among black intellectuals and leaders who voiced their disgust and distrust of “fake reparations” as either an “apology” for slavery or as a sop to black charities and “rights” organizations that thirst for bounty from a reparations pot.
Some damned deplorable old ofay racist blue-eyed devil cracker muuhfuuuuh delves a little deeper :
HOT FLASH: Concerning slavery and interracial animosity, there are things everyone should know – yeah, more “in the land of should” stuff – but few people do: The institution of slavery is as old as recorded human history. Slavery still exists today, though “under cover,” in the Middle East, Africa, and various Indian Ocean societies. Among First World nations, the first to abolish slavery was Great Britain in 1833. The United States followed in 1866. You may recall the unpleasantness that was required to do so. Interracial animosity is a constant of human existence. Attempts to eliminate it have failed wherever and whenever they’re tried. History suggests that interracial animosity is not connected to whether slavery exists or has ever existed in a given locale.
In other words, the races naturally look upon one another with a degree of suspicion that unfortunate events can elevate to open hostility. Moreover, there are reasons for this: not cultural but biological reasons that are written into the genes of every race.
White Americans have done their damnedest to eliminate interracial friction. It hasn’t worked – but not because white Americans haven’t given it a sincere effort.
White Americans have allowed black racialists, in collaboration with the political class, to make us feel guilt for something in which we had no part: slavery. Indeed, most of us have no ancestors who ever owned slaves. The total number of American slaveowners before 1866 was about 30,000. Even if those thirty thousand slaveowners had borne ten children each, and their children and children’s children did likewise, that would amount to only 30 million descendants of slaveowners: less than 10% of today’s population.
But slavery – more specifically, “the legacy of slavery” — is the hook on which the racial rabble-rousers hang their claims of white oppression of blacks. It’s total nonsense and always has been, even in the South during the Jim Crow era .
Don’t take my word for it; look it up. American blacks prospered steadily, both economically and socially, from 1866 to 1964: a century of relentless advancement. Husbands were reunited with wives. Families sundered by slavery regathered. Ironically, Southern blacks did better, statistically, than those who relocated to Northern states, even under the Jim Crow regime: the Northern cities to which they moved tended to erect barriers to the trades and new enterprises the migrating blacks would otherwise have entered!
But racialist demagogues don’t want you to know that. It would take the bread out of their mouths. They also don’t want you to know that by inhibiting productive work and encouraging illegitimacy and fatherless families, the welfare state has done more harm to American blacks than two centuries of slavery could ever have done .
Racialist demagogues are far more concerned with maintaining their followings and the revenue to their “foundations” than with improving any aspect of race relations. So the crusade to impose unearned guilt on American whites and extract tribute from us through the legal system must continue.
And people ask where the white identity and white nationalist movements get their impetus. It is to laugh…hollowly, and with many a tear.
Now, I don’t disagree with any of the sentiments expressed in the above excerpted posts. Any attempt at “reparations” legislation will be scandalous folly, doomed to fail for all sorts of good and patently obvious reasons. It will end up satisfying precisely no one on either side of the equation—not the beneficiaries, not the people forced to pay a tab in no just or logical sense their own. It will be unjust and tyrannical by definition, coercing people whose ancestors never owned a single slave into coughing up handsomely to other people many of whom are not the descendants of slaves. It will be farcical, unfair, unethical, and completely unworkable.
Worse yet, it will also be truly, definitionally racist: a government-sponsored program of coerced confiscation from blameless people guilty of no crime, the ill-gotten gains then gifted to ersatz “victims” who have been done no conceivable harm—ie, a wealth-redistribution scam based wholly on skin color and nothing whatsoever else.
In other words, these comically-misnomered “reparations” will be just another typical government boondoggle, gratifying only the tens of thousands (or more) of overpaid, slothful bureaucrats hired to manage the whole sorry scheme—bureaucrats who will never be fired, because this new grift will conjure reasons for itself to extend its mandate indefinitely…just like every other eternal government goat-rope does.
I know all this, and so do you, and so does anybody with half a lick of sense. Honestly, though, I hope they go through with it anyway. Because I’m pretty danged confident that the day the “reparations” con is voted into existence will also be the day every self-respecting white person in the country quietly removes himself from the taxpayer rolls for good, his eyes having been opened at last to his true status as both despised whipping-boy and taken-for-granted feed trough. Which overdue awakening, in turn, will mark the beginning of the end for FederalGovCo, however the final result ends up working itself out."
Ex-Auburn coach Tommy Tuberville to run for U.S. Senate seat in Alabama - Breitbart,www.breitbart.com,,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.breitbart.com/news/ex-auburn-coach-tommy-tuberville-to-run-for-u-s-senate-seat-in-alabama/,"Ex-Auburn coach Tommy Tuberville to run for U.S. Senate seat in Alabama UPI 6 Apr 2019
April 6 (UPI) — Former Auburn football coach Tommy Tuberville announced Saturday he will run for the U.S. Senate in Alabama as a Republican.
Tuberville, who also has coached at Mississippi, Texas Tech and Cincinnati, said he will seek the seat held now by Democrat Doug Jones, who defeated Republican Roy Moore in a special election on Dec. 12. Jones became the first Democrat to hold become a senator from Alabama since 1992.
“After more than a year of listening to Alabama’s citizens, I have heard your concerns and hopes for a better tomorrow,” Tuberville, 64, posted on Twitter. “I am humbled to announce the next step — I will be a @GOP candidate for US Senate. I invite you to join my team.”
Sean Spicer, the former White House press secretary, is working on Tuberville’s campaign, CBS Sports reported.
The Republican primary is March 3, 2020, and the general election is Nov. 3, 2020.
U.S. Rep. Bradley Byrne, R-Mobile, also is seeking the Senate seat.
In 2017, Tuberville filed paperwork and took out a $100,000 loan for a potential campaign as governor. He ultimately decided against it, citing his support for Gov. Kay Ivey, the Montgomery Advertiser reported.
Tuberville has never run for political office before.
In coaching, he won 159 games with 99 losses over 21 years, including 85-40 in 10 seasons with Auburn as the most successful coach at the Alabama school.
He made the announcement before Auburn men’s basketball played for the first time in the NCAA Final Four — against Virginia in Minneapolis, Minn.

Great March of Return is Palestinians' Cry for Justice,www.opednews.com,Ramzy Baroud,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.opednews.com/articles/Great-March-of-Return-is-P-by-Ramzy-Baroud-Great-Return-March_Hamas_Israel_Justice-190406-697.html,"Details DMCA - Advertisement -
The aims of the Great March of Return protests, which began in Gaza on March 30 last year, are to put an end to the suffocating Israeli siege and implement the right of return for Palestinian refugees who were expelled from their homes and towns in historic Palestine 70 years ago.
But there is much more to the protests than a few demands, especially bearing in mind the high human cost associated with them. According to Gaza's Ministry of Health, more than 250 people have been killed and 6,500 wounded, including children, medics and journalists.
Aside from the disproportionately covered ""flaming kites"" and youths symbolically cutting through the metal fences that have caged them for many years, the marches have been largely nonviolent. Despite this, Israel has killed and maimed protesters with impunity. - Advertisement -
A UN human rights commission of inquiry found last month that Israel may have committed war crimes, resulting in the deaths of 189 Palestinians, within the period March 30 to December 31. The inquiry found ""reasonable grounds to believe that Israeli snipers shot at children, medics and journalists, even though they were clearly recognizable as such,"" the investigators concluded.
Many in the media, however, still do not understand what the Great March of Return really means for Palestinians. A cynically titled report in the Washington Post attempted to offer an answer. The article, ""Gazans have paid in blood for a year of protests. Now many wonder what it was for,"" selectively quoted wounded Palestinians who, supposedly, feel that their sacrifices were in vain. Aside from providing the Israeli military with a platform to blame Hamas for the year-long march, the long report ended with these two quotes: The March of Return ""achieved nothing,"" according to one injured Palestinian. And ""the only thing I can find is that it made people pay attention,"" said another.
If the Washington Post paid attention, it would have realized that the mood among Palestinians is neither cynical nor despairing. The Post should have wondered: If the march had ""achieved nothing,"" then why are Gazans still protesting, and why has the popular and inclusive nature of the march not been compromised? - Advertisement -
Sabreen Al-Najjar, the mother of young Palestinian medic Razan, who was fatally shot by the Israeli army while trying to help wounded protesters, wrote in the Independent last week: ""The right of return is more than a political position, more than a principle: Wrapped up in it, and reflected in literature and art and music, is the essence of what it means to be Palestinian. It is in our blood.""
Indeed, what is the Great March of Return but a people attempting to reclaim their role, and be recognized and heard in the struggle for the liberation of Palestine?
What is largely missing from the discussion on Gaza is the collective psychology behind this kind of mobilization, and why it is essential for hundreds of thousands of besieged people to rediscover their power and understand their true position, not as hapless victims, but as agents of change in their society.
The narrow reading, or the misrepresentation, of the Great March of Return speaks volumes about the overall underestimation of the role of the Palestinian people in their struggle for freedom, justice and national liberation.
The story of Palestine is the story of the Palestinian people, for they are the victims of oppression and the main channel of resistance, starting with the Nakba the creation of Israel on the ruins of Palestinian towns and villages in 1948. Had Palestinians not resisted, their story would have concluded then, and they would have disappeared.
Those who admonish Palestinian resistance or, like the Post, fail to understand the underlying value of popular movement and sacrifices, have little understanding of the psychological ramifications of resistance the sense of collective empowerment and hope that spreads among the people. In his introduction to Frantz Fanon's ""The Wretched of the Earth,"" Jean-Paul Sartre describes resistance, as was passionately vindicated by Fanon, as a process through which ""a man is recreating himself."" - Advertisement -
For 70 years, Palestinians have embarked on that journey of recreation of the self. They have resisted, and their resistance in all of its forms has molded a sense of collective unity, despite the numerous divisions that were erected among the people. The Great March of Return is the latest manifestation of the ongoing Palestinian resistance.
It is obvious that elitist interpretations of Palestine have failed; Oslo proved a worthless exercise in empty cliches, aimed at sustaining American political dominance in Palestine as well as in the rest of the Middle East. The signing of the Oslo I Accord in 1993 shattered the relative cohesiveness of the Palestinian discourse, thus weakening and dividing the Palestinian people."
Donald Trump resorts to speaking ill of the dead - Palmer Report,www.palmerreport.com,Robert Harrington,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.palmerreport.com/analysis/whole-new-low-trump-manage-donald/17218/,"Donald Trump resorts to speaking ill of the dead Robert Harrington | 3:00 pm EDT April 6, 2019 Line
It is so thoroughly manifest in human convention, it’s even enshrined in Latin: “de mortuis nihil nisi bonum” (of the dead speak nothing but good). Whenever there have been exceptions we have always known what they were, and without needing to be told, e.g., Hitler, e.g., Charles Manson. Whatever side of the political aisle one may occupy, I think most rational people would agree that Barbara Bush belonged on the “nihil nisi bonum” side of the ledger.
Except Trump, of course. With Trump, no one and nothing is sacred. It’s a constant of Donald Trump’s peevish littleness to expect something small, decayed, infantile, churlish and unbecoming from his mouth for any occasion on any topic. The hilarious early days of the Trump “presidency,” when broadcasters were wringing their hands and positively hugging themselves with delight concerning the “any day now” prospects of Donald Trump doing something, anything, “presidential,” are thankfully over.
And now for my least favorite bit when writing for Palmer Report. I sometimes have to quote Donald Trump. Here goes. “I have heard that she was nasty to me, but she should be. Look what I did to her sons.” I suppose among the worst things you can do to a mother is boast about how you have harmed her children. Lucky for Trump, Mrs. Bush isn’t around to defend herself.
Yet again “the Donald” took a shot, and yet again it was an indecorously cowardly and cheap one. Had he had Roger Stone around to defend him, he might have said what Stone said: “she’s dead and he’s president – who won that one?”
In the era of the “best words” uttered by the “best people,” Donald Trump has taken us to a low I would not have thought possible two years ago. Not to say I didn’t know then that he was capable of being cheap and petty and scabrous and uncouth – I’ve known about that for 35 years or so – no, it’s that so many Americans would continue to adore him despite that. That so many Americans would applaud even when he attacks beloved icons of the past like Barbara Bush, icons of their very own party. For me, of course, Donald Trump occupies the Hitler and Manson side of the “nihil nisi bonum” ledger. When Trump eventually dies, I plan to speak ill of him immediately, savagely, unsparingly and continuously. And the sooner the better. "
Identity Rules: A Report from Reddening Chicago,www.opednews.com,Paul Street,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.opednews.com/articles/Identity-Rules-A-Report-f-by-Paul-Street-Chicago-Americas-Murder-And-Racist-Killing-Capitol_Chicago-Mayoral-Race_Chicago-Police_Emmanuel-190406-478.html,"New Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot( Image by Daniel X. O’Neil from USA • CC BY 2.0) - Advertisement -
Fake-Progressive Identity Cloaking
Beyond the identity-politicized excitement of Chicago electing its first Black female chief executive and becoming the largest U.S. city to have a Black female mayor (and to have a gay mayor), there wasn't all that much for a leftist to choose from between victor Lori Lightfoot and her opponent Toni Preckwinkle. Mayor-Elect Lightfoot is a longtime corporate lawyer, a partner in the venerable multinational Mayer-Brown firm, and a former federal prosecutor. She covered for the legendarily racist Chicago police (currently operating under a federal civil rights consent decree) in her role as the head of outgoing Mayor Rahm Emanuel's Police Accountability Task Force. She did the same on the Chicago Police Board under Mayor Richard M. Daley.
A Chicago Tribune investigation of Lightfoot's Mayer-Brown years found that ""she has represented corporate clients accused of racial discrimination, as well as police and prosecutors accused of the kind of misconduct she has criticized as a candidate. Lightfoot also has made millions of dollars working at a firm whose attorneys have represented tobacco companies and other corporate clients accused of egregious wrongdoing."" - Advertisement -
None of this stopped Lightfoot from branding herself as an outsider ""progressive"" seeking to clean up the city's corrupt practices and deliver its forgotten people and neighborhoods from oppression and neglect.
""It's hard,"" Chicago native Matt Reichel wrote me, ""not to be skeptical of a former federal prosecutor who spent most of her career siding with the cops in police misconduct cases until she recently decided to opportunistically re-brand herself a 'reformer.'""
There's a reason that white police officers voted for Lightfoot. ""If someone had told me in the era of Richard J. Daley (when I moved to Chicago) that cop neighborhoods such as Mount Greenwood would vote overwhelmingly for an African American woman,"" longtime Chicago activist Kingsley Clark writes, ""I would have said: 'What are you smoking, man!' The word 'progressive' lost meaning with the Clintons and was buried deep in this mayoral election. Those Chicagoans who cling to that illusory concept are going to be mightily disappointed."" - Advertisement -
Like with the silver-tongued neoliberal ""from Chicago"" (really from Honolulu and Harvard Law) Barack Obama? Obama must have used the word ""progressive"" at least a thousand times to describe himself on his path to the presidency between 2004 and 2009. We saw how that worked out.
The 44th president called to congratulate Lightfoot, one rich fake-progressive identity-cloaked corporatist talking to another.
A Neoliberal Machine Mayor-in-Waiting
Lightfoot's victory is arguably another in a long line of nails in the coffin of the old Chicago machine. Preckwinkle is a longstanding machine politician, the president of the Cook County Board and the head of the Cook County Democratic Party. She has been caught up in the campaign finance shenanigans of the legendarily corrupt 14th Ward alderman Ed Burke. The Black female Preckwinkle was bidding to become the first politician to hold both the Chicago mayoralty and the top Cook County Democratic position since the original Chicago Mayor Daley the last big city patronage boss Richard J. Daley (whose reign ran from 1955 through 1976).
But the old machine, based on the trade of city jobs for votes, died long ago. The new machine under Mayors Richard M. Daley (1989-2011) and Rahm ""Mayor 1%"" Emanuel (2011-2019) has been based on neoliberal ""pinstripe patronage"" the trading of city contracts, corporate privatization deals, tax-breaks, and taxpayer-funded development deals greased by regressive Tax Increment Financing (TIF) arrangements (rampant throughout the city). The ""business community"" got behind Lightfoot in the reasonable expectation that she will keep urban neoliberalism machine set on profit.
According to veteran Chicago left activist and author Joe Allen, ""The fact that the leader of the Democratic Party and such an entrenched politician as Preckwinkle went down to historic defeat shows once again that the political establishment is under siege in Chicago and across the United States...But when it comes to all the key issues around police reform, gentrification, the schools,"" Allen ads, Lightfoot ""is our class enemy."" - Advertisement -
What's Officially ""Historic"" and What's Not
Beyond the ideologically narrow contest between Lightfoot and Preckwinkle, the most interesting and genuinely progressive development in Chicago's runoff election last Tuesday was that three self-described socialists Byron Sigcho Lopez (25th Ward), Rossanna Rodriguez-Sanchez (30th Ward), and Andre Vasquez (40th Ward) defeated establishment aldermanic candidates. Lopez, Rodriguez-Sanchez, and Vasquez will join two other socialists Dan La Spata (1st Ward) and Carlos Ramirez-Rosa (35th Ward) in the Chicago City Council."
Deflation Is Not Preventing Consumers from Buying Items in Japan,www.opednews.com,Dean Baker,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.opednews.com/articles/Deflation-Is-Not-Preventin-by-Dean-Baker-Decline_Economy_Japanese-Internment_Money-190406-574.html,"Details DMCA - Advertisement -
The New York Times ran one of its periodic pieces on how bad things are in Japan. The gist of this piece is that China's economic slowdown is hurting Japan, so Japan may have been mistaken to rely on China as a major export market. As the subhead tells readers:
""A slump in exports raises questions about how effective Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's economic policies would have been without Chinese help.""
This is a truly bizarre sort of argument. China has the largest economy in the world on a purchasing power parity basis. It is also very close to Japan geographically. It would be utterly nuts for Japan not to turn to China as a major market for its exports. - Advertisement -
Furthermore, most projections show that China's economy is slowing, not going into a recession. But, even if it does fall into a recession, it is unlikely that it will last forever. If China has a growth rate of 5.0 percent annually coming out of the recession (far below its recent pace), it will be by far the fastest growing market in the world in absolute size. Japan's businesses would surely want access to this market.
The piece also paints a dire picture of Japan's economy that is at odds with reality. It comments:
""Longstanding problems like deflation, bureaucracy and a shrinking population added friction to the country's growth. - Advertisement -
""As deflation pushed down prices, companies struggled to increase profits. Deflation generally discourages consumers from making major purchases as they wait for lower prices and better deals.""
Japan's rate of deflation has only exceeded 1.0 percent in 2009. With a rate of deflation of 1.0 percent, a $20,000 car would sell for $100 less if buyers waited six months. It is unlikely that many consumers will make that decision. In this respect, it is worth noting that computer prices have fallen at double-digit annual rates for most of the last four decades. This has not impaired sales in the computer industry in any obvious way.
The piece also bizarrely asserts:
""Increasing government spending has also proved tricky.
""Japan has the highest level of debt in the industrialized world, so finding money to spend can be difficult.""
Actually, Japan borrows long-term at a negative nominal interest rate , meaning that investors pay the Japanese government to borrow money from them. That means finding money to spend is in fact very easy. (Its interest burden is lower as a share of GDP than in the United States.) - Advertisement -
More generally, the picture of Japan as an economic basket case turns reality on its head. As I wrote a few months back:
""According to the IMF , Japan's per capita GDP has increased by an average rate of 0.9 percent annually between 1990 and 2018, while this is somewhat less than the 1.5 percent rate in the United States, it is hardly a disaster. In addition, average hours per worker fell 15.8 percent in Japan over this period, compared to a decline of just 2.9 percent in the United States.""
The story of Japan's economy being in desperate straits is entirely a media invention, it is not based in reality."
Michael Cohen claims he's given federal prosecutors new evidence of Trump-related crimes,www.opednews.com,Daily Kos,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.opednews.com/articles/Michael-Cohen-claims-he-s-by-Daily-Kos-Crime_Injustice_Investigation_Michael-Cohen-190406-588.html,"Details DMCA
While Attorney General Bill Barr has been hiding the Mueller report from Congress, and Donald Trump has been running around claiming full exoneration (a claim sadly repeated by many traditional news outlets and Very Serious People in the media), Michael Cohen has been very busy combing through his records, records that were recently returned to him by prosecutors. - Advertisement -
In an interview on MSNBC's The Beat with Ari Melber , Cohen's attorney, Lanny Davis, told Melber that Cohen has given new evidence of crimes to prosecutors in the Southern District of New York. Here's the exchange between Davis and Melber (the entire interview can be seen below): DAVIS: Mr. Cohen is fully cooperating with the Southern District of New York and is offering more information that he's now discovered when he retrieved back his documents and cell phones from the Southern District. He's working with Congress.
Melber: Are you suggesting he has additional evidence beyond what he laid out in his congressional testimony?
Davis: That is correct. And he also has additional information for the Southern District of New York involving other criminal behavior. - Advertisement -
Davis also marveled that no charges have been filed against Trump. Organization executives Donald Trump Jr. and Allen Weisselberg, who were clearly implicated in the criminal conspiracy to illegally reimburse Cohen for hush money related to the Stormy Daniels case. Davis noted how exceptionally rare it was for someone to publicly testify about crimes committed by a sitting president, both before and after he took office, and have nothing come from that. He further noted that while there might be objections to indicting a sitting president, Donald Jr. and Weisselberg are not covered under any similar legal arguments, and it is truly puzzling that they have not yet been charged.
In related news, Cohen (via his attorneys) reached out to Congress this week to say he has been going over the devices and files returned to him by the SDNY and has retrieved 14 million files from a hard drive. Those files contain ""emails, voice recordings, images and attachments from Mr. Cohen's computers and phones. To date, Mr. Cohen has located several documents that we believe have significant value to the various congressional oversight and investigation committees.""
Cohen and Davis are asking for Cohen's prison sentence to be delayed so that he can continue to comb through these records to provide additional information to prosecutors, and they note the injustice of Cohen being the only Trump Organization employee to be doing prison time for these crimes.
Finally, in closing, we write this as Mr. Cohen's attorneys, as well as those who believe in basic justice. It is a fact that Mr. Cohen remains the only member of the Trump Organization, including Mr. Trump himself, who has been prosecuted and who is going to prison for conduct almost all of which was for the benefit of Mr. Trump personally and indeed directed by him. In our opinion, there is something unjust here. In addition, it is our professional opinion that the length of the sentence to which Mr. Cohen was subjected is, most respectfully, disproportionate given the particular facts and circumstances underlying each of the crimes to which Mr. Cohen pled guilty.
In addition to that letter, Davis sent a 12-page memo to House Democrats . From BuzzFeed:
In a 12-page memo sent to top House Democrats, Cohen's attorneys said Trump ""encouraged Cohen to lie and say all Moscow Tower project contacts ended as of January 31, 2016 using 'code' language telling Cohen during various conversations that there was 'no collusion, no Russian contacts, nothing about Russia' after the start of the campaign. [...]"" - Advertisement -
Davis went further, attaching documents they claim show additional crimes committed by Donald Trump.
The more than 100 pages of documents included with Cohen's memo claim to lay bare a ""conspiracy to collude"" with the Russian government during the campaign, along with an array of other crimes by the president. The memo also for the ""first time discloses Michael Cohen's testimony to the Mueller team and to other non-public testimony to congressional committees,"" according to Cohen's legal team.
In addition, Cohen and Davis claim that Trump instructed him to lie about the Moscow Trump Tower project and that Ivanka Trump was aware that Cohen had initially lied to congressional investigators probing the Moscow Trump Tower deal."

A new White House report proposes cutting regulations to protect workers and children, while piling on yet more tax cuts for billionaires. Spiderman, Hulk, Captain America, and Iron Man Details DMCA Take the recent forecast by the White House Council of Economic Advisers. It essentially hails Trump as genius-on-a-stick, claiming that his economic policies will achieve magical growth and prosperity for the people in perpetuity.
Never mind that most of these policy proposals aren't even being considered, much less enacted. Indeed, the council's report is so fantastical that some student interns who worked on it slipped in such comic book names as Batman, Captain America, and Spider-Man, citing them for helping prepare it! - Advertisement -
Mockery aside, the report does reveal that Trump and company are quietly pushing a radical right-wing deregulation agenda under the ruse of stimulating economic growth.
For example, it calls for eliminating minimum safety and educational standards for operators of child care centers, complaining that such regulations to protect children can ""increase the cost of obtaining care, thus serving as a disincentive [for parents] to work.""
Yeah, just shoo the little tykes into unregulated corporate pig pens, so mom and dad can work minimum-wage jobs, thus boosting corporate profits all-around, and then call the whole mess ""progress."" - Advertisement -
Meanwhile, the president's economists admit that the only way they can get America's economic growth above a dismal 2 percent a year is for Congress to make two big changes: (1) roll back labor rules that protect America's workers from corporate exploitation, and (2) pass another round of even deeper tax cuts for corporations and billionaires, since the 2017 cuts didn't work .

Mitch McConnell is destroying the Senate -- and American government,www.opednews.com,Robert B.

Yes, Donald Trump has debased and defiled the presidency. He has launched blistering attacks on Democrats, on judges he disagrees with, journalists who criticize him and the intelligence community.
But McConnell is actively and willfully destroying the Senate.
Last Wednesday he used his Republican majority to cut the time for debating Trump's court appointees from 30 hours to two , thereby enabling Republicans to ram through even more Trump judges. - Advertisement -
McConnell doesn't give a fig about the Senate, or about democracy. He cares only about winning. On the eve of the 2010 midterm elections he famously declared that his top priority was for Barack Obama "" to be a one-term president .""
Between 2009 and 2013 , McConnell's Senate Republicans blocked 79 Obama nominees. In the entire history of the United States until that point, only 68 presidential nominees had been blocked.
This unprecedented use of the filibuster finally led Senate Democrats in 2013 to change the rules on some presidential nominees (but not the supreme court), to require simple majorities.
In response, McConnell fumed that ""breaking the rules to change the rules is un-American."" If so, McConnell is about as un-American as they come. Once back in control of the Senate he buried Obama's nomination of Merrick Garland for the supreme court by refusing even to hold hearings.
Then, in 2017, McConnell and his Republicans changed the rules again , ending the use of the filibuster even for supreme court nominees and clearing the way for Senate confirmation of Trump's Neil Gorsuch.
Step by step, McConnell has sacrificed the Senate as an institution to partisan political victories. - Advertisement -
There is a vast difference between winning at politics by playing according to the norms of our democracy, and winning by subverting those norms.
To Abraham Lincoln, democracy was a covenant linking past and future. Political institutions, in his view, were "" the legacy bequeathed to us ."" On the eve of the Senate's final vote on repealing the Affordable Care Act in July 2017, the late John McCain returned to Washington from his home in Arizona, where he was being treated for brain cancer, to cast the deciding vote against repeal. Knowing he would be criticized by other Republicans , McCain noted that over his career he had known senators who seriously disagreed with each other but nonetheless knew ""they had an obligation to work collaboratively to ensure the Senate discharged its constitutional responsibilities effectively."" In words that have even greater relevance today, McCain added that ""it is our responsibility to preserve that, even when it requires us to do something less satisfying than 'winning.'"" Political success should never be measured solely by partisan victories. It must also be judged by the institutional legacy passed onward. The purpose of political leadership is not merely to win. It is to serve. In any social or political system it's always possible to extract benefits by being among the first to break widely accepted norms. In a small town where people don't lock their doors or windows, the first thief can effortlessly get into anyone's house. But once broken, the system is never the same. Everyone has to buy locks. Trust deteriorates. Those, like Mitch McConnell, who break institutional norms for selfish or partisan gains are bequeathing future generations a weakened democracy.
The difference between winning at politics by playing according to the norms and rules of our democracy, and winning by subverting them, could not be greater. Political victories that undermine the integrity of our system are net losses for society.
Great athletes play by the rules because the rules make the game. Unprincipled athletes cheat or change the rules in order to win. Their victories ultimately destroy the game.
In terms of shaping the federal courts, McConnell has played ""the long game,"" which, incidentally, is the title of his 2016 memoir . Decades from now, McConnell will still be shaping the nation through judges he rammed through the Senate.
But McConnell's long game is destroying what was once known as the world's greatest deliberative body.
He is longest-serving leader of Senate Republicans in history but Mitch McConnell is no leader. He is the epitome of unprincipled power. History will not treat him kindly."

Deformed face of Lady Liberty
On Friday, in its latest move against Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro ""official"" Washington put sanctions on companies, its heads and 35 tankers delivering oil to Cuba.
Looking at the names-none recognized here-it appears Washington is getting desperate with its schemes to bring down Maduro. - Advertisement -
Though we continue to hear the likes of idiot Senator Marco Rubio intoning the all too familiar ""all options are on the table"", aka a US military operation into Venezuela, even he concedes the Venezuelan army and a majority of the people continue their support of Maduro, not Juan Guaido, the self appointed interim president of Venezuela the US and its lackeys recognize.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has made it clear he doesn't support US actions against Maduro, as does China, Cuba, Nicaragua, Bolivia, Iran ,South Africa, North Korea and notably NATO members Turkey and Italy all countries the US has sanctioned, threatened or provoked-Turkey accepting Russian made S-400 ABM's and Italy signing on to China's BRI, Belt and Road Initiative, which the US condemns as Chinese overreach.
But the key country against US depredations in Venezuela is Russia. - Advertisement -
Russia doesn't have a huge military contingent in Venezuela, some 100 military personnel-reportedly-advisers and a couple of military transports that recently sent material and cargo over the last two weeks.
We continually hear Trump and his coterie of officials barking they want Russia out of the country yet it appears Russia isn't going anywhere, bringing a stalemate to US intentions for regime change.
The world is watching.
Any US led or supported military, mercenary operation against Venezuela will be seen as outright aggression against a sovereign country, the worst form of aggression cited in the UN Charter which the US is a signatory. It would be a war crime.
Initiating coups, assassinations, regime change operations against any government the US opposes, many that were legitimately elected, exposes Washington as the sinister empire that it is.
Certainly not a supporter of ""freedom and democracy"", a falsehood that masks its real intentions. - Advertisement -
Though the propaganda of America's ""goodness"" in the world continues to be spewed by Washington's unofficial mouthpiece, its complicit enabling corporate MSM, more and more American people recognize they've been sold a rotten bill of goods-though other than some protest demonstrations have yet to rebel in significant numbers.
As this author candidly admits it may be wishful thinking Venezuela could be Washington's last gasp attempt at regime change where the world finally steps up and says enough. Washington's depredations against Venezuela are so bald faced, out in the open, they're unmistakably aggression, against international law.
More and more voices are heard in Europe, one of the latest was a German MP who said, ""70 year old NATO should retire [1] , as he lambasted the organization for conducting aggressive wars."

I'm calling Sen. Sanders ""the Ref"" because he has successfully resisted almost all of the DNC and RNC scams and traps.
Unlike tRump who allowed the RNC to roll over him to install a wide array of these nuts and kooks, Sanders has an actual history of independence from the corruption inherent in money-focused factions.
Every time you hear that 10% of Sanders supporters voted for tRump... understand the FULL truth. In open primary states where Republicans were allowed to vote for Sen. Sanders, between 12 to 14% of Registered Republican voters crossed party lines in support. When Sen. Sanders was cheated out of the primary by the DNC, those Registered Republicans REFUSED to vote Hillary so it is true that about 10% of these registered Republicans voted for tRump. They refused to vote Hillary.
This is a BIG clue as to how Sen. Sanders would beat tRump. Biden won't win, he is stuck in a #metoo loop and has NO history of beating propaganda and half-truth rhetoric. Sen. Sanders has the specific history of being successfully independent with the right vision.
I can't wait to see his administrative picks. This is the man that BUILT the Progressive Caucus and lit the imagination of the new generation of women and minorities.

""We are now faced with the fact, my friends, that tomorrow is today. We are confronted with the fierce urgency of now. In this unfolding conundrum of life and history, there is such a thing as being too late. Procrastination is still the thief of time. Life often leaves us standing bare, naked, and dejected with a lost opportunity.""
- Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr., ""Beyond Vietnam."" Riverside Church, April 4, 1967
Dear Chelsea, - Advertisement -
Do not lose heart, for as a prisoner of conscience, your inspirational witness sustains so many of your less free brothers and sisters on the outside. Our hearts and hands reach out to you with love and thanksgiving. Your courage is contagious, or so I hope, for it resonates in the soul of every person who senses the meaning of the power of individual conscience to oppose state violence and the beauty of those who will not betray a comrade, who will not deliver the Judas kiss demanded by the killers, as you will not betray your brave brother, Julian Assange, also held under lock and key for the ""crime"" of revealing the truth.
You remind me of another young woman from long ago and far away whose bravery in the face of radical evil is celebrated today as a sign of hope in dark times. She is Sophie Scholl, the young German college student who, like you, was arrested for releasing documents exposing state atrocities, who, like you, was prompted by a higher power, by her conscience, who, like you, was arrested for releasing documents exposing such crimes against humanity, in her case those of Hitler.
Little seems to change over the years, doesn't it? The killers go on killing, from Golgotha in ancient Jerusalem to Hitler's Germany to Vietnam and Iraq and on to Palestine and Syria today. Why bother with the list. History is a litany of bloodbaths. Where does it all go, this blood? Does the good earth soak it up? - Advertisement -
But in all the darkness, certain lonely voices of resistance have kept the lighted chain of faith alive. You stand in that line, a living embodiment of a faithful non-violent warrior. So does Julian.
I am writing this epistle to you on 4 April, the day in 1967 that our brother Dr. Martin Luther King stood tall in the pulpit of Riverside Church in New York City and followed his conscience by breaking with those who urged him to ignore the truth eating at his soul. The truth that he must not remain silent about the U.S. obscene war against Vietnam. ""A time comes when silence is betrayal,"" he said. Then he added:
""The truth of these words is beyond doubt, but the mission to which they call us is a most difficult one. Even when pressed by the demands of inner truth, men do not easily assume the task of opposing their government's policy, especially in time of war. Nor does the human spirit move without great difficulty against all the apathy of conformist thought within one's own bosom and in the surrounding world"" This I believe to be the privilege and the burden of all of us who deem ourselves bound by allegiances and loyalties which are broader and deeper than nationalism and which go beyond our nation's self-defined goals and positions. We are called to speak for the weak, for the voiceless, for the victims of our nation, for those it calls ""enemy,"" for no document from human hands can make these humans any less our brothers"". A true revolution of values will soon cause us to question the fairness and justice of many of our past and present policies. On the one hand, we are called to play the Good Samaritan on life's roadside, but that will be only an initial act. One day we must come to see that the whole Jericho Road must be transformed so that men and women will not be constantly beaten and robbed as they make their journey on life's highway. True compassion is more than flinging a coin to a beggar. It comes to see that an edifice which produces beggars needs restructuring"". When I speak of love, I am not speaking of some sentimental and weak response. I am not speaking of that force which is just emotional bosh. I am speaking of that force which all of the great religions have seen as the supreme unifying principle of life. Love is somehow the key that unlocks the door which leads to ultimate reality. This Hindu-Muslim-Christian-Jewish-Buddhist belief about ultimate reality is beautifully summed up in the first epistle of Saint John: ""Let us love one another (Yes), for love is God. (Yes) And every one that loveth is born of God and knoweth God. He that loveth not knoweth not God, for God is love. . . . If we love one another, God dwelleth in us and his love is perfected in us."" Let us hope that this spirit will become the order of the day.""
Chelsea, you have heeded Dr. King's message and you have put to shame those of us who profess faith in ""the living God"" that informed Martin's call for a non-violent revolution.
You, like Sophie and Julian, have released documents that tell the truth about the savage actions of our government.
You have suffered for us many times over. You have stood strong and tall, like Jesus in front of Pilate, and you have shown the road we must all travel out of the darkness that threatens to consume us. - Advertisement -
You have shown us by your actions ""that silence is betrayal"" when it comes to one's government's immoral and illegal actions.
And you have shown us by your sacred silence in Caesar's court that is a U.S. grand jury, that your conscience will never allow you to betray another truth-teller.

Nonzero: The Logic of Human Destiny, is an ambitious book, with a title that one might deem grandiose. But the author, Robert Wright, crafts a satisfying, readable tour de force that synthesizes human history, anthropology, game theory, biology, and ethics. Readers of OpEdNews should find the book interesting, because it speaks to hopes for progressive change and because it transcends (or is orthogonal) to debates about top-down versus bottom-up change.
The book first explores the evolution of human societies towards larger and more complex social organizations. Hunter-gatherers came under the command of village chiefs. Over time, chiefdoms defeated, or merged, with other chiefdoms, forming city-states. This evolution was accompanied by the rise of agriculture and writing. City-states eventually merged to form nation states, which traded with, and fought with, one another. Nation states merged into larger nations and, recently, into supranational governing bodies such as the European Union and the United Nations. - Advertisement -
The reasons why people and communities merge into larger cooperative entities are twofold. First by banding together they can better compete with other groups, either in war or in economic exploitation (e.g., corporations). Another reason for merging into larger, cooperative entities is that free trade and division of labor are more efficient. The market system, of products, services, and ideas, allows for greater economic productivity and a richer cultural life.
""[E]xpanding non-zero-sumness has in the meanwhile carried the rational for supernational governance well beyond peacekeeping."" That is, it's not only because war is so destructive that city-states and nations cooperate and construct international rules and mechanisms of cooperation. ""Everything from tax policy to accounting standards to environmental policy to policing power is creeping towards the supra-national level."" The result needn't be a single world government. It could be something like the European Union, wherein member states give up some sovereignty and, effectively, become like provinces in confederation.
Even biology isn't all about competition, though books on evolution tend to emphasize survival-of-the-fittest. Genes cooperate within and between chromosomes. Species cooperate symbiotically. Animals care for and ""love"" their offspring, their siblings, and their kin. There are social insects. Among humans, the growth of civilization has involved the extension of altruism towards wider and wider swaths of humanity, and to more and more species. The fittest species have evolved means to cooperate. - Advertisement -
Ants and other social species thrive because the various individuals have identical genes. There is strong evidence that the mitochondria that power our cells were once independent bacteria-like organisms. Kin selection explains why we may risk our lives for close relatives. Reciprocal altruism explains why we may make sacrifices for countrymen. ""Non-zero-sumness, in addition to being the reason that organic complexity exists, and the reason communication got invented, is the reason there is love."" (p 262)
The logic of non-zero-sumness is what ""organized genes into little primitive cells, little primitive cells into complex, eukaryotic cells, cells into organisms, and organisms into societies.""
Wright argues that, contrary to what the biologist Stephen Jay Gould claims, there is a direction to evolution: towards more complexity. Furthermore, it's not true that species evolve only in response to changing habitats. They evolve also in response to other species. For example, there is an arms race of complexity between predator and prey species. And there are non-zero sum interactions that increase complexity and cooperation: it pays to specialize.
Evidence of increasing complexity includes the fact that eyesight has arisen independently in evolution dozens of times, while flight has arisen at least three times. Multi-cellularity evolved more than ten times. Organelles (such as mitochondria and chloroplasts) evolved multiple times, but it's unclear whether the important invention of the nucleus was repeated.
Similar evolution is apparent in the cultural sphere. Across continents, multiple societies have evolved from hunter-gatherers, to chieftans, to city-states, and then to nation states.
Chance events (e.g., meteors) can have a huge effect on details of evolution they can even destroy many species. But, Wright argues, the general trajectory of increasing complexity and higher levels of coordination seem to be universal in both biology and cultures. - Advertisement -
Wright makes a good analogy. The person who wins the lottery is extremely lucky: the chance of a particular person winning is very low. But the chance that someone will win the lottery is very high. Similarly, we humans are lucky that our ancestors accumulated the traits needed for us to develop intelligence, dexterity and culture. But, contends Wright, it seems likely that some species would evolve these features, because the various components have evolved separately and because arms races between species are an ""escalator"" that tends to drive species towards higher complexity.
Genes and memes co-evolve. For example, genes for larger brains, for dexterous hands, and for vocal chords that could speak certainly co-evolved with cultural accretions that took advantage of those abilities.
Both biological evolution and cultural evolution depend on the interplay between zero-sum games (competitions, such as predator-prey dynamics and war) and non-zero sum games (the coordination by individuals to win the zero-sum games). ""[Z]ero-sum dynamics intensify non-zero-sum dynamics; competition between entities encourages integration within them."" Alas, war is an engine of creation."
Senator Merkley of Oregon Sounds Alarm on McConnell's Senate Tricks to Ram Confirmation for Trump's Judges,www.opednews.com,Stephen Fox,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.opednews.com/articles/Senator-Merkley-of-Oregon-by-Stephen-Fox-Judge-Merrick-Garland_McConnell-Mitch_Merkley-Jeff_Reid-Harry-190405-911.html,"(33 fans) - Advertisement - Mitch McConnell Destroys The Senate So Trump Can Destroy The Judiciary Mitch McConnell has changed the rules of the Senate so that Donald Trump's judicial picks can get approved even faster. The .nuclear option. that McConnell is ... Details DMCA
This is far more serious than I had originally determined, and will result in Trump's reshaping so much of America's judiciary, a warped legacy that will go on for decades, even if Trump resigned tomorrow....I hope to compile some other Senate commentaries on this urgent matter.
McConnell has said the rule change was necessary given that roughly 80 percent of Trump administration nominees are being held up. - Advertisement -
""The status quo is unfair, unhealthy and unsustainable,"" McConnell said in an op-ed sent to the Courier Journal this week . ""This president and all future presidents deserve a more functional process for building their administrations.""
From Martin Longman's brilliant analysis of the Senate history involved in his oped in the 4/1/2019 Washington Monthly:
What makes the nuclear option ""nuclear"" is that it violates the rules in order to change the rules. It should require a super-majority to change a rule, so using a mere majority to make it so a mere majority can prevail is not supposed to be permissible. - Advertisement -
In this case, McConnell is going nuclear to eliminate a problem that he invented. It was only because of McConnell's willingness to abuse the spirit of the rules that Harry Reid eventually succumbed to pressure to fight back in the only way he could.
Many people warned that as soon as Reid took one step down that road, it would open the floodgates to more and more changes to eliminate the minority party's rights in the Senate. Others warned that the Republicans would make the same changes once they were in the same position, so it was foolish for Reid to hold off on the premise that he could preserve comity in the Senate. Both groups were correct. McConnell was intent on breaking the traditional Senate, and his guiding star is only to do what gives him an advantage in whatever set of circumstances he finds himself. This rule change isn't such a big deal in itself. It only speeds up the process of confirming people who are going to confirmed anyway. But it's galling that McConnell is willing to explain the change by arguing that ""Since January 2017, for the first time in memory, a minority has exploited procedure to systematically obstruct a president from staffing up his administration."" A benevolent God would strike him dead for making a statement that egregiously self-serving and false.
To quote Senator Merkley: Mitch McConnell has taken another step shattering the Senate to pack the courts with right-wing ideologues.
First, it was an all-out confirmation blockade, refusing to confirm any Obama nominees to the DC Circuit, often called the nation's second-most important court.
Then, of course, there was the unprecedented theft of a Supreme Court seat. Then using the ""nuclear option"" to ram through confirmation of a Supreme Court justice with little debate. And now the nuclear option again, this time to enable him to dramatically increase the rate at which Trump nominees get confirmed, with little scrutiny and virtually no debate.
If historians look back wondering who broke America, the answer very clearly will be Mitch McConnell. And that's why it's critical that we fire him as majority leader, put Democrats back in charge, and then fix the Senate that McConnell and the Republicans have so badly damaged. - Advertisement -"

It is curious that the host of Information Clearing House has not responded to Tom Feeley. Legally it would seem that the host of the website could tell the owner of the website that the host company had decided to cease hosting the website. But the host should not be able to effectively steal the ICH content by preventing Tom Feeley's access to his website's material.
Moreover, ethically, the host company should provide time for ICH to transfer to a new host.
If this is an action by the host, Tom should tell us who is the host so that everyone can protest and boycott that company. Indeed, the host might be subject to legal action.
It is possible that the host is not responsible and does not know the explanation. ICH's disappearance could be the work of an immature and narcissist hacker amusing himself by causing trouble for others. It could be the work of the CIA, NSA, or Israel Lobby, or some Identity Politics freak. It could be a glitch of the digital world -- just wait until there are self-driving cars. You can't trust the digital world any more than you can trust CNN, MSNBC, NPR, the New York Times, Washington Post, Washington or London.
We can take for granted that there will be determined attacks on all truth-tellers as they challenge the controlled explanations that those who rule use to hide their real agendas. Not long ago all of the interviews on my site disappeared. Fortunately, it was possible to recover them and provide additional backup.
The cost both personal and financial of providing alternative explanations to the controlled ones is rising. If readers don't support the sites that are willing to take on the challenges and risks of trying to ascertain and tell the truth, truth will disappear. - Advertisement -
Truth might disappear anyway. Consider that Julian Assange has been framed by Washington -- which is determined to destroy WikiLeaks for telling the truth -- and essentially imprisoned for many years in the Ecuadoran embassy in London. The presstitute media, instead of defending the constitutional right and responsibility of journalists to hold governments accountable, instead worked hand in hand with tyrants to destroy Julian Assange. Yet there are still large numbers of insouciant fools who rely on these presstitutes for their information.
In addition to the growing censorship, I have noticed among younger generations the disappearance of the very concept of objective truth. They see truth as the mere expression of some identity interest. There are racial truths, gender truths, sexual preference truths, and apparently also age truths. The younger ages, or many of them, cannot tell the difference between an explanation and a justification. If you explain something to them, they think you are defending it, or endorsing it, and that it is your belief. In other words, communication on the basis of facts and logical explanation becomes impossible.
I think much of the Western world has sunk into this mind-frame, which might also be the case in the rest of the world."

I don't share the interest many have in the reported mass shootings. However, there are wider issues associated with the shootings, and I do find these issues interesting. For example, mass shootings are a relatively new occurrence. I believe the first was in 1966 at the University of Texas when a former US Marine who was enrolled as a student shot a number of people from the university's clock tower. What caused this breakdown in moral behavior? We can't simply say that the shooter became unhinged or insane. There have always been such people. Had the Marine been on active duty in Vietnam and experienced mass shootings of Vietnamese? Did he decide to bring the horror inflicted by Americans on Vietnamese home to Americans? Did student protests against the Vietnam war in which he was at risk make him feel unappreciated?
I don't remember if there were answers provided in 1966. I understand people's frustration with the lack of answers that is often the case in events today. For example, readers ask me, as if I know, why the New Zealand government has criminalized having a copy of the New Zealand shooter's manifesto. I do not know, but a good guess is that the New Zealand government wants to control the explanation, and does not want any competition from the shooter himself.
Remember the 2016 Nice, France, truck attack on Bastille Day when a white delivery van was reported to have run over a large number of people. The only video we had of the truck's progress was a fuzzy one that showed little taken at a distance from a hotel balcony by the exact same person who provided the only video of an earlier reported terror attack in Germany. That the same person happened to be present with camera ready for back-to-back terrorist events in two different countries struck many as suspicious. - Advertisement -
Suspicions mounted when it was reported that Nice city officials had video cameras on every corner, block by block, of the avenue along which the truck progressed, but were prohibited from releasing the videos by the central authorities in Paris who ordered the Nice officials to destroy the only evidence that clearly recorded the event.
Nice authorities resisted this order as it was an order to destroy evidence, which is a felony, but the evidence was never publicly provided. Many who followed the story justifiably concluded that the French government was hiding the evidence in order to control the story. The presstitute media, including the BBC, never expressed any interest in why the actual evidence of what happened was deep-sixed. The presstitutes reported as if the fuzzy video, which in fact showed no one being hit by a truck, much less the more than 500 reported killed or injured, proved the official story.
All of these terror events, those that seem to be real and those that seem to be staged, have explanations ready prior to the event. Indeed, the explanation of the event is sometimes provided as the news is reported. This should strike people as suspicious, and it does strike some that way. - Advertisement -
Thus, I understand that many wonder why the New Zealand government and the presstitute media are suppressing the shooter's explanation.
A long succession of poorly reported terror events, together with such blatant and obvious lies told by Washington and its NATO vassals as Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction, Assad's use of chemical weapons, Iranian nukes, Russian invasion of Ukraine, Russia-gate, the lies about Gaddafi, Maduro the dictator starving his own people, and so on and on, have destroyed trust in governments and the media. People are accustomed to seeing high government officials of Western countries stand in front of a TV camera and tell the most blatant and obvious lies.
Whatever you decide is the case in the New Zealand shooting, take care not to conflate a protest or a defense of the West, however misguided, with ""white supremacy,"" as the latter is how the story is spun. If a defense of the West is white supremacy, then a defense of blacks is black supremacy and a defense of Jews is Jewish supremacy. It is, of course, much safer to defend blacks and Jews than white gentiles, which shows that whites certainly have no supremacy.
Consider also whether there is a difference between the New Zealand shooter killing Muslims in a mosque and the US and its vassals, including the New Zealand government, killing Muslims in mosques, weddings, funerals, schools, hospitals, and play grounds during the past 20 years of indiscriminate bombings that constitute ""the war on terror.""
Terror is what the Western governments with scant protest inflict on Muslims. Perhaps the New Zealand shooter thought as everyone else was killing Muslims, he could also.
Another interesting question is whether left-wing and Jewish groups who work overtime to demonize white people, especially heterosexual males, have any responsibility for the New Zealand shooter's reported attack. Was it an act of frustration by a shooter provoked by the constant demeaning of his race, gender, sexual preference, and culture? - Advertisement -
Jewish lobbies have largely succeeded in establishing Jewish Supremacy. In many Western countries it is, or borders on, a hate crime to criticize Jews and Israel. Scholars have even been imprisoned for correcting errors in the Holocaust story. In the US, Jewish lobbies have succeeded in having half of the states pass laws denying state government contracts to any business or person who participates or supports in any way boycotts of Israeli goods and services or advocates for disinvestment in Israeli companies. President Trump even cut off US aid to the Palestinians whose country has been stolen by Israel. It is considered antisemitism to even mention what Israel has done, and is currently doing, to Palestinians. Professors lose their university positions. Journalists get fired. Students are sent to sensitivity training.
This is real supremacy. White gentiles have nothing like it. Yet Jewish lobbies -- the very people who constantly complain about hate speech -- use hate speech to the full extent as they lead the movement to demonize white gentiles. Here is the latest ""media advisory"" from the Center for Jewish Civilization at Georgetown University."
Kim holds onto lead at Texas Open - Breitbart,www.breitbart.com,,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.breitbart.com/news/kim-holds-onto-lead-at-texas-open/,"Kim holds onto lead at Texas Open AFP 6 Apr 2019
San Antonio (AFP) – South Korea’s Kim Si-woo will take a slender one-shot advantage into the final round of the Valero Texas Open after a birdie on the 18th hole left him within sight of a wire-to-wire victory on Saturday.
Kim, who had started the day four shots clear, had gradually been reeled in by Canada’s Corey Conners as he struggled to adjust to steady rain and gusty winds at TPC San Antonio’s AT&T Oaks Course.
However the 23-year-old from Seoul steadied himself on the back nine, and delivered a birdie on the long par-five 18th to post a three-under-par 69 to move one shot clear of the field heading into Sunday’s final round at 15 under.
“It was a tough day, rain and wind early on,” said Kim. “But the weather got better and I played better. I felt a little bit of pressure but it feels great and I’m looking forward to tomorrow.”
Conners meanwhile put himself into contention after carding a six-under-par 66 which left him at 14 under after 54 holes.
Conners, who is yet to taste victory on the PGA Tour, could complete a remarkable week on Sunday if he is able to claim the his first title.
The 27-year-old is only playing in San Antonio this week after battling through qualifiers last Monday, winning a six-way playoff to book his place in the field.
A win on Sunday would leave Conners $1.35 million richer, and earn him a ticket to next week’s Masters in Augusta.
“I’ve managed my game really well, struck the ball really solidly, got myself out of trouble,” Conners said. “It’s a tricky golf course and ball striking is really important. I feel like I’ve been really solid with all of that.”
Conners and Kim spent most of the day locked in a duel for the lead.
Early on, Kim could only watch as the birdies dried up and Conners chipped away at his lead with five birdies and four pars over the front nine.
After opening with a bogey, Kim could only make two birdies before the turn to leave him locked with Conners down the stretch.
A birdie on the par-four 10th moved Kim to 14 under overall while Conners could only bogey.
Conners reeled off back-to-back birdies on the 11th and 12th to move to six under for the day, and although a bogey on the 15th threatened to check his progress, a birdie on the par-three 16th kept him at 14 under.
Kim, who had aced the par-three 16th on Friday, was left kicking himself after missing a short birdie putt which would have given him sole possession of the lead. However he recovered with a birdie on the 18th to ensure a slender advantage ahead of the final round.
Kim and Conners will have little margin for error on Sunday, however, with a crowded leaderboard lurking just off the pace.
Leading the chase behind is Charley Hoffman, who produced the best round of the week on Saturday with an eight-under-par 64, 13 under overall after 54 holes.
Three players are two shots behind Hoffman on 11 under — Venezuela’s Jhonattan Vegas, Lee Kyoung-hoon of South Korea and Scott Brown.
But there was disappointment for three-time major winner Jordan Spieth. Spieth endured a Jekyll and Hyde round, making two bogeys and two double bogeys over the front nine to reach the turn at six over for the day.
Spieth however shrugged off that disastrous start to make five birdies over the back nine including a birdie-birdie-birdie finish to claw his way back to seven under, eight off the pace.

What Monroe Doctrine?,www.opednews.com,Philip Giraldi,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.opednews.com/articles/What-Monroe-Doctrine-by-Philip-Giraldi-Economic_International_Military_Monroe-Doctrine-190405-678.html,"Details DMCA - Advertisement -
Because there is a presidential election coming up next year, the Donald Trump Administration appears to be looking for a country that it can attack and destroy in order to prove its toughness and willingness to go all the way in support of alleged American interests. It is a version of the old neocon doctrine attributed to Michael Ledeen, the belief that every once in a while, it is necessary to pick out some crappy little country and throw it against the wall just to demonstrate that the United States means business.
""Meaning business"" is a tactic whereby the adversary surrenders immediately in fear of the possible consequences, but there are a couple of problems with that thinking. The first is that an opponent who can resist will sometimes balk and create a continuing problem for the United States, which has a demonstrated inability to start and end wars in any coherent fashion.
This tendency to get caught in a quagmire in a situation that might have been resolved through diplomacy has been exacerbated by the current White House's negotiating style, which is to both demand and expect submission on all points even before discussions begin. That was clearly the perception with North Korea, where National Security Adviser John Bolton insisted that Pyongyang had agreed to American demands over its nuclear program even though it hadn't and would have been foolish to do so for fear of being treated down the road like Libya, which denuclearized but then was attacked and destroyed seven years later. The Bolton mis-perception, which was apparently bought into by Trump, led to a complete unraveling of what might actually have been accomplished if the negotiations had been serious and open to reasonable compromise right from the beginning. - Advertisement -
Trump's written demand that Kim Jong Un immediately hand over his nuclear weapons and all bomb making material was a non-starter based on White House misunderstandings rooted in its disdain for compromise. The summit meeting with Trump, held in Hanoi at the end of February, was abruptly canceled by Kim and Pyongyang subsequently accused Bolton and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo of making ""gangster-like"" demands.
The second problem is that there are only a few actual casus belli situations under international law that permit a country to attack another preemptively, and they are usually limited to actual imminent threats. The current situation with Venezuela is similar to that with North Korea in that Washington is operating on the presumption that it has a right to intervene and bring about regime change, using military force if necessary, because of its presumed leadership role in global security, not because Caracas or even Pyongyang necessarily is threatening anyone. That presumption that American ""exceptionalism"" provides authorization to intervene in other countries using economic weapons backed up by a military option that is ""on the table"" is a viewpoint that is not accepted by the rest of the world.
In the case of Venezuela, where Trump has dangerously demanded that Russia withdraw the hundred or so advisers that it sent to help stabilize the country, the supposition that the United States has exclusive extra-territorial rights is largely based on nineteenth and early twentieth century unilaterally declared ""doctrines."" The Monroe Doctrine of 1823 and the Roosevelt Corollary of 1904 de facto established the United States as the hegemon-presumptive for the entire Western Hemisphere, stretching from the Arctic Circle in the north to Patagonia in the south. - Advertisement -
John Bolton has been the leader in promoting the Monroe Doctrine as justification for Washington's interference in Venezuela's politics, apparently only dimly aware that the Doctrine, which opposed any attempts by European powers to establish new colonies in the Western Hemisphere, was only in effect for 22 years when the United States itself annexed Texas and then went to war with Mexico in the following year. The Mexican war led to the annexation of territory that subsequently became the states of California, New Mexico, Nevada, Utah, Arizona and Colorado. In the same year, the United States threatened war with Britain over the Oregon Territory, eventually accepting a border settlement running along the 49th parallel.
Meanwhile the march westward across the plains continued, forcing the Indian tribes back into ever smaller spaces of open land. The US government in the nineteenth century recognized some Indian tribes as ""nations"" but it apparently did not believe that they enjoyed any explicit ""Monroe Doctrine"" rights to continue to exist outside reservations when confronted by the ""manifest destiny"" proponents who were hell bent on creating a United States that would run from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean.
The Roosevelt Corollary of 1904 amended the Monroe Doctrine, making it clear that the United States believed it had a right to interfere in any country in the western Hemisphere to maintain good order, which inevitably led to exploitation of Latin American nations by US business conglomerates that could count on a little help from US Marines if their trade agreements were threatened. In 1898, Washington became explicitly imperialist when it defeated Spain and acquired effective control over Cuba, a number of Caribbean Islands and the Philippines. This led to a series of more than 30 interventions by the US military in the Caribbean and Central America between 1898 and 1934. Other states in the region that were not directly controlled by Washington were frequently managed through arrangements with local autocrats, who were often themselves generals.
Make no mistake, citing the Monroe Doctrine is little more than a plausible excuse to get rid of the Venezuelan government, which is legitimate, like it or not. The recent electrical blackouts in the country are only the visible signs of an aggressive campaign to destroy the Venezuelan economy. The United States is engaging in economic warfare against Caracas, just as it is doing against Tehran, and it is past time that it should be challenged by the international community over its behavior. Guns may not be firing but covert cyberwarfare is total warfare nevertheless, intended to starve people and increase their suffering in order to bring about economic collapse and take down a government to change it into something more amenable to American interests."

Withholding the revelations of the Mueller report to the general public arouses the highest suspicions of culpability in the matters investigated as well as the judicial propriety in handling the report by the Attorney General. This action undermines the essential trust people should have in its government and casts further doubts on its legitimacy.
A country is bound together by a sense of patriotism. Citizens are asked to risk their lives for country in the event of war or subversion. In our democratic society, founded upon the principle of government of, by, for the people, it is incumbent upon officials to equally serve our country by performing their duties in a faithful and honest fashion. If there is any malfeasance disclosed in the Mueller report, it is their patriotic and moral duty to report it to the public. To deceive the public by suppressing the truth in vital concerns marks one not fit to govern and an enemy of the people.
There is an essential difference in standards of ethics in the worlds of government and business, although seldom observed. Business operates with compromised ethics to achieve maximum material gain. Good government aspires to universal principles of ethics to promote the general welfare, which may be different from achieving maximum material gain. Government should not be ruled by people following business ethics.
We look for someone in government like Daniel Ellsberg or Chelsea Manning, who takes his or her patriotic responsibilities and dedication to universal principles of morality seriously, to bypass the red tape and present the Mueller report to the public regardless of risk. - Advertisement -"
UK's May warns deal with opposition only way to secure Brexit - Breitbart,www.breitbart.com,,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.breitbart.com/news/uks-may-warns-deal-with-opposition-only-way-to-secure-brexit/,"UK’s May warns deal with opposition only way to secure Brexit AFP 6 Apr 2019
London (AFP) – Prime Minister Theresa May on Saturday defended her decision to turn to Britain’s main opposition to get her EU divorce deal approved, warning without cross-party consensus Brexit could “slip through our fingers”.
The beleaguered leader opened talks this week with the Labour Party in a bid to break months of stubborn opposition in parliament to the withdrawal agreement she struck with European leaders last year.
MPs have rejected three times her deal finalised with the bloc last November to end 46 years of membership.
May’s overtures to Labour came ahead of an EU summit on Wednesday where she must secure another Brexit extension, until June 30, to prevent Britain crashing out the bloc at the end of next week with no accord.
The country’s original March 29 departure date was delayed to April 12 last month.
“We must deliver Brexit and to do so we must agree a deal,” May said in a statement released by Downing Street, adding the two main parties agreed on major aspects of Brexit.
“That is the basis for a compromise that can win a majority in parliament and winning that majority is the only way to deliver Brexit.
“The longer this takes, the greater the risk of the UK never leaving at all. It would mean letting the Brexit the British people voted for slip through our fingers.”
However after several days of negotiations with Labour, its leader Jeremy Corbyn complained he had not “noticed any great change in the government’s position so far”.
“I’m waiting to see the red lines move,” he added.
Meanwhile EU members, who must give unanimous backing to any further Brexit delay, are growing increasingly impatient at the dysfunction in Westminster.
They could offer just a shorter postponement — or a longer period of up to a year.
French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told reporters at a G7 meeting in France on Saturday that it was time for the Brexit crisis to end.
“The British authorities and the British parliament need to understand that (the EU) is not going to be able to constantly exhaust itself with the ups and downs of domestic British politics,” he said.
However Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar cautioned it was “extremely unlikely” a member would veto another extension, while revealing he now favoured a lengthy delay.
–‘Restore national identity’–
Despite the continued uncertainty over Brexit, it emerged on Saturday that the British government has begun issuing passports with the words “European Union” removed from the front cover.
The interior ministry said a longstanding decision to start introducing the travel documents without reference to the bloc had gone ahead from March 30.
But it confirmed that some newly issued passports will still bear the bloc’s name due to an attempt to save public money by using up “leftover stock”.
British passports had already become ensnared in the country’s Brexit divisions.
The government in 2017 announced that it would return to traditional blue passports “to restore national identity”, pleasing Brexiteers but drawing scorn from Remainers.
The travel documents had dark blue covers from 1921, but Britain switched to burgundy from 1988, in common with other members of the-then European Community.
The new production contract is to begin in October 2019, with passports currently being issued in the burgundy colour.
–‘Listen to suggestions’–
Whether Britain will have left the bloc by then is uncertain.
Even those of May’s Conservative colleagues who back her deal have denounced any outreach to Labour, while the most hardline Brexiteers remain implacably opposed to her deal.
Reports in Britain’s Sunday newspapers said Tory MPs would try to oust May if Britain had to contest European Parliament elections in late May as part of a lengthy Brexit delay.
But Finance Minister Philip Hammond, who backed Remain in Britain’s 2016 referendum and is seen as favouring as soft a Brexit as possible, urged his divided party to show flexibility.
“We should be open to listen to suggestions that others have made and some people in the Labour Party are making other suggestions,” he said.
Labour is pushing for a much closer post-Brexit alliance with the EU, including participation in a customs union.
May has previously dismissed the idea because it bars Britain from striking its own trade deals with global giants such as China and the United States.
But the opposition party is also facing internal division on the issue.
Eighty Labour MPs wrote to Jeremy Corbyn on Saturday urging him to secure a guarantee of a second referendum in any Brexit deal he reaches with May.

Team Mueller Fires a Warning Shot,www.opednews.com,Marc Ash,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.opednews.com/articles/Team-Mueller-Fires-a-Warni-by-Marc-Ash-Attorney-General-William-Barr_Mueller-Investigation_Team-Mueller_Truth-190405-499.html,"Details DMCA - Advertisement -
Attorney General William Barr moved swiftly and deliberately to preemptively control the narrative on the Mueller Report. The report itself was two years in the making and the subject of significant speculation and anticipation. Barr's summary, days after the report was delivered to him by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, seemed to commandeer the discussion and redirect it in an optimal direction for Donald Trump's public relations messaging.
Recent revelations through intermediaries to reporters at The New York Times, The Washington Post, and NBC News have provided the first official indication that Barr's representations of the report may have been inaccurate at best, if not politically motivated. It might be only the beginning.
This first round of expressions by Mueller team members, although not without important clues, consists of measured disclosures through third parties. It's a shot across the bow of the Trump camp and the Attorney General. - Advertisement -
Investigators working for Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox during the Watergate investigation, as the process reached a climax in the fall of 1973, were wary of what Nixon might do with the vast powers of the presidency to derail their investigation. Now, decades later, the Watergate investigators openly admit they made copies of the key evidence and the most sensitive documents, taking copies out the door with them to preserve what they had found.
It is hard to imagine that Mueller's Russia-gate investigative team, with the constant threat of being shut down or derailed by President Trump, would not have taken similar precautions.
Part of what Mueller's investigators are saying is: ""We can and we will if necessary, resist any official attempt to cover up the findings of this investigation."" In an investigation that has been as buttoned up as any high-profile investigation in U.S. history, these signs of protest mark a significant departure from the seamlessly comment-less Special Counsel process that has operated in a virtual media vacuum for two years. - Advertisement -
If there was evidence of obstruction by President Trump or anyone acting on his behalf, that would necessarily constitute evidence of a cover-up. The ""team members"" now finding ways to be heard understand that evidence quite well they compiled it. Seeing the cover-up continue by the suppression or redefining of the findings of their investigation is apparently not setting well.
Attorney General Barr's preemptive public relations strike appears to have failed, and the truth is starting to assert itself. If Barr continues his efforts to keep the grist of the Mueller investigation out of public view, team Mueller is well positioned to push back. They seem willing.

Review: Bergdahl: Reluctant soldier - confused peacenik,www.opednews.com,Eric Walberg,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.opednews.com/articles/Review-Bergdahl-Reluctan-by-Eric-Walberg-Desertion_Soldier-Captured_Taliban-190405-309.html,"- Advertisement - Matt Farwell, Michael Ames, American Cipher: Bowe Bergdahl and the US Tragedy in Afghanistan , Penguin, 2019.
Bergdahl captured the American imagination in 2009 when he disappeared from what had become his living hell. His battalion commander, Lt Baker, was not only an obnoxious tyrant (handing out Field-Grade Article 15s, just short of a court martial, supposedly for being out of uniform, but in fact for complaining about the mission to a Guardian photo-journalist in a video broadcast), but he had ordered them to build the OB (observation post) Mest on a cemetery, defiling, even defecating on gravestones near the FOB (forward operating base) Sharana.
He was as much a victim of the latest American COIN (counterintelligence) strategy as a deserter. Taken captive by the enemy (Taliban) under the protection of an ally (Pakistan), embodying the self-enforcing illogic of the entire war.
The FOB's OP (army talk is littered with acronyms and abbreviations, quickly reducing any text or conversation to gobbledygook) would transfer authority to Afghan troops operate under US troops, the idea being to eventually leave the Afghans in sole charge. They would establish security, identify the Taliban, separate them from the local population, show the villagers they were better off with Karzai and the Americans in charge. Abracadabra. The Taliban would just disappear, as they very well ought to. - Advertisement -
But it's not the Taliban who have disappeared. Between 2006 and 2014, 20,000 soldiers have deserted from Iraq and Afghanistan. Since 2001 the army pressed charges against less than 2,000, half pleaded guilty, 78 were tried and convicted. That pales in comparison to more than half a million draft resisters/ deserters from 1966 to 1973. Desertion is as American as apple pie.
Bergdahl's 4 weeks of hell sent him over the edge. He forgot the most important rule about the army. Don't think. Just obey orders. Your superior is always right. It's not clear what exactly B decided he was going to do, but he snuck away in the night, careful not to be noticed and headed for "" hmmm. I guess he hadn't really decided anything other than giving himself over to the Taliban, which was pretty easy. Hours after dawn, the word got out and Taliban equivalent of UPS picked up their load and whisked him across the border into FATA (federal administrative tribal areas) in Pakistan, just out of reach of the US army.*
Domino or butterfly effect? - Advertisement -
His desertion (he eventually ignored his defence lawyer and pleaded guilty) set in motion a domino effect on a massive scale, but not the one the prosecution tried to pin on him: that B's desertion led to soldiers' deaths. The early angry accusations soon melted under examination, leaving B's actions as a butterfly effect in a chaotic world.
Even his hated superior Baker later admitted that DUSTWUN (missing soldier alert), while difficult, had also produced some of the greatest disruptions of Taliban networks that he had seen at any point during the war. Commanders in the field used the search for Bergdahl as a justification for more aggressive tactics to achieve stability in the area.
It was a great way to motivate troops -- rescuing a soldier was more 'fun' that just terrorizing hostile Afghans. It was a real mission, not the phony one they would be doing otherwise. ""Everyone knew it was going on.""
Baker sounds like a real SOB (making all the troops shave 6 times in a row because one missed a stray hair, screaming two inches from their faces). Insisting the OB be built on a cemetery and desecrating graves set off an alarm in B's mind. Afghan soldiers were known to turn their guns on their American comrades for less. But, what the hell, whiskey, tango foxtrot,** Afghanistan is FUBAR.***
In American Cipher , Farwell and Ames don't need any purple prose. Hard facts do the trick. For instance, in 2007 a soldier in B's 2nd Platoon, Blackfoot Company, 1/501, Evan Vela, killed an unarmed captive Iraqi on orders from his superior, staff sergeant Hensley. He was court-martialed and sentenced to 10 years. Rather than murder, Henley was acquitted, charged only with a minor infraction.
It would be hard to beat Sergeant Robert Bales who slipped off base in Kandahar twice in one night in 2012 and shot 16 civilians in their homes in front of their families. At least he got life. It's a miracle that B's handlers didn't string him up in response when they heard of this. - Advertisement -
B enlists in 2008 and he is deployed in May 2009. At the end of training (Fort Richardson, Alaska), Command Sergeant Major Wolfe told them: I know you all joined because you want to rape, pillage and kill. That's why I joined. But you need to think about COIN, winning over local farmers, merchants, drivers.
The training screams of cognitive dissonance. During training, they would chant 'trained to kill, kill we will.' Sex assaults and rapes were rampant at Fort Richardson."

Ten percent of us have high concentrations of ten or more toxins in our blood,www.opednews.com,Robert Adler,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.opednews.com/articles/Ten-percent-of-us-have-hig-by-Robert-Adler-Citizens_Diet-And-Health_Health_Health-190405-397.html,"By Robert Adler (Page 1 of 1 pages) (# of views) 5 comments , In Series: What are we doing to our kids and ourselves? - Advertisement -
It's common knowledge that we're all exposed to many different kinds of toxins from the air we breathe, the water we drink, the pesticides and other chemicals we're exposed to and many other sources, and that some of those accumulate and persist in our bodies. Pollutants have a variety of health impacts Details DMCA
What we didn't know but researchers have just discovered, is that at least some of those pollutants are not spread randomly through the population, with some individuals having more of one and others having more of a different one. Much like income or wealth, some people have just a little while some have a lot. - Advertisement -
A new study of Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs)--the first that looked at many different kinds of POPs in the same people at the same time--found that that they were strongly clustered, with more than 10% of the U.S. population carrying ten or more different POPs in their blood at concentrations above the 90th percentile. Blacks, people with low incomes, people with a high body mass index (BMI) and older individuals were more likely to carry heavy loads of multiple organic toxins.
When I asked physician and epidemiologist Miquel Porta , one of the study's authors, about the implications of his findings, he first cautioned about stirring up fear. ""As a physician, I firmly believe that fear is seldom compatible with a broad vision of health,"" he wrote. However, he went on to emphasize that finding that a large number of people have 90th-percentile-or-higher concentrations of 10 or more known toxins needs to be noted by researchers and public health authorities:
""Whatever we know, whatever we think we know about the adverse health effects of a given chemical compound, and about the adverse health effects of several different compounds, simply think that it will not be uncommon for them to be--each and all--present at high concentrations in a significant minority of your patients, constituency, citizens, family or friends. And then think about the plausible negative health effects of the combination or 'cocktail' at high and low concentrations."" - Advertisement -
As reported in the journal PLOS One , Porta and his colleagues looked at the concentrations of 91 POPs in the blood of 4739 people living in the U.S. They found that 13% of the people studied had 10 or more of the most frequently detected organic pollutants at or above 90th percentile levels. You can view the original article here . ""Decades after the evidence on the presence of toxic chemical mixtures in humans became available, official approaches to assess the risks for human health of such mixtures continue to lag tragically behind scientific evidence of the adverse effects of individual compounds and the potential effects of mixtures,"" Porta writes. ""We provide a method to improve exposure assessment. Our method is an important complement to what is usually done.""
In other words, it's no longer justifiable to study one toxin at a time in one group of people at a time. Now that we know that many different toxins pile up in certain populations, with the odds tilted by race, age, income and other factors, studies, recommendations and regulations that don't take that into account from the start are likely to seriously underestimate the risks to the health of a significant number of people.
Porta and his colleagues have followed up on these findings by studying the impacts of multiple toxins in seemingly healthy people. You can read my post about that work here ."
Israel was behind President Morsi's overthrow says Israeli General,www.opednews.com,Abdus-Sattar Ghazali,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.opednews.com/articles/Israel-was-behind-Presiden-by-Abdus-Sattar-Ghaza-Amnesty_Camp-David_Coup_Custody-190405-297.html,"(8 fans) - Advertisement -
Israel was behind the 2013 coup in Egypt that toppled Mohammad Morsi, Egypt's first ever democratically-elected president, an Israeli general has revealed.
In June 2012, Mohammad Morsi, a member of the Muslim Brotherhood party, become Egypt's first freely elected president.
Israeli Brigadier General Aryeh Eldad wrote in an article in Maariv newspaper that Israeli intelligence officials had reason to believe that Morsi ""intended to cancel the peace agreement with Israel and send more Egyptian military forces to the Sinai Peninsula.""
In 1978, Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin signed the Camp David peace agreement that, among other things, required Israel to withdraw all forces from the Sinai Peninsula while limiting the number of forces Cairo could deploy to the region. The peace agreement also called for the resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. - Advertisement -
In October 1981, President Anwar Sadat was assassinated during the annual victory parade held in Cairo to celebrate Operation Badr (1973), during which the Egyptian Army had crossed the Suez Canal and taken back Sinai Peninsula from Israel.
According to Eldad, when Israeli officials found out about Morsi's alleged plans, they made it a priority to overthrow the Egyptian president and replace him with the current president, General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, who served as Morsi's defense minister before the coup.
""At that stage, Israel was quick and willing to activate its diplomatic tools, and perhaps even greater means, to bring Abdel Fattah el-Sisi to power in Egypt, and convince the then US administration under President Barack Obama not to oppose this move,"" wrote the Israeli general. - Advertisement -
General el-Sisi, who later assumed the title of Field Marshal, came to power in 2013, after leading the successful military coup against President Morsi.
Egyptian parliament is now considering constitutional changes to extend his presidency until 2034.
Forty years after the Camp David peace treaty, Jordan and Egypt are the only two Arab states to have full diplomatic ties with Israel, but the relations remain limited and taboo among the general populations.
Eldad pointed out that ""it is too early to talk about the usefulness of the peace agreement with Egypt, 40 years after the signing of the Camp David agreement in 1979, and contrary to the expectations that were issued when it was made, the agreement was able to withstand and continue, but opponents of the withdrawal from Sinai were not wrong then, because we did not have a real peace with Egypt.""
He added that ""the Camp David agreement is the first of its kind between Israel and a hostile Arab state, which was then the largest and most dangerous Arab country. It resulted in the withdrawal until the last millimetre according to the international border between Egypt and Israel, knowing that I did not expect that Sadat would fulfil his commitment to the peace agreement with Israel, but I was wrong, too.""
After the military coup in 2013, newly instated President Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi pledged to maintain peace with Israel. Cooperation between Tel Aviv and Cairo has since strengthened, with the two countries coordinating efforts against an alleged insurgency in the Sinai. - Advertisement -
In 2015, Egypt voted for Israel to join the UN Office for Outer Space Affairs. This was the first time that Egypt had ever voted in Israel's favor at the United Nations.
Egyptian security officials regularly close the Rafah border crossing into Gaza and destroy tunnels used by smugglers to transfer basic food and medication to the besieged enclave, home to some two million Palestinians.
The deposed president Morsi, 68, has been serving a 20-year prison term on charges of ordering the arrest and torture of protesters, a 25-year jail term on charges of passing intelligence to Qatar and a three-year term for insulting the judiciary."
Republicans Have Put Our Country on a Path of Warp-Speed Decline -- And They Want You to Think It's Worth Cheering For,www.opednews.com,Thom Hartmann,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.opednews.com/articles/Republicans-Have-Put-Our-C-by-Thom-Hartmann-Funding_Health_Republican-GOP-Dirty-Tricks_Republican-Pandering-190405-772.html,"- Advertisement -
Listening to Republicans, it's apparent they don't have much respect for the intelligence of the American people.
Over 70 percent of Americans want a national health care system like every other developed country in the world has, but the GOP tells us that we just aren't smart enough to make it work. It'll be too confusing and complex for average Americans, they say, and, besides that, if the government ""takes over"" our health care system, we're on our way to tyranny.
About two-thirds of Americans think that we should have free college education for anybody intellectually capable of attending, and free trade schools as well -- like pretty much every other developed country in the world (and quite a few of the developing countries). Republicans tell us that we can't use government funds to pay off our nation's $1.5 trillion in student debt because we just borrowed that exact amount last year to give tax rebates to billionaires, so there's nothing left. We're just not smart enough to fix the problem. - Advertisement -
And we could never, they tell us, go back to the free college like Thomas Jefferson created ( he founded the University of Virginia as a free college), Abraham Lincoln instituted (he pushed for and got legislation to create 54 ""land grant"" colleges like Michigan State University with enough formerly public land that they could provide free or very cheap tuition), and Ronald Reagan ended in California when he was governor. Grandpa might have been able to pay for college with a part-time job in a gas station or restaurant (as I and most in my generation did), and no other country in the world may have the kind of student debt we have, but it's just the way it is, they tell us. American's just can't figure it out.
Nearly eight out of 10 Americans think taxes should be raised on the wealthy, but, the Republicans tell us, that would create economic chaos and destroy the economy. We'd end up like all those other countries where there's a strong and vibrant middle class, but the billionaires can't hoard their wealth without limit, and that would be a disaster... because... freedom . Americans who think rich people should pay their fair share of taxes to help the country are just, well, not that bright, says the GOP.
Just under two-thirds of Americans think our minimum wage should be $15 and look at Denmark, where MacDonald's pays $20 an hour and a Big Mac costs only 80 cents more than in the United States (and Danish workers can easily afford that!). ""Can't we do that or even three-quarters of that?"" they ask. ""No,"" Republicans say, ""it'll be too much of a burden on the poor executives and stockholders who might have to take slightly lower pay and dividends. It's not possible."" We're just not clever enough to figure out how to do such things, they tell us. - Advertisement -
The Green New Deal is supported by 81 percent of registered voters , but, Republicans tell us, Americans just aren't as smart as Norwegians (who have 60 percent of all car sales electric now and will totally phase out gas and diesel cars in eight years) or Germans (who produced more than 100 percent of the electricity their country needed a few days last year from renewable sources). We have to keep digging coal and drilling for oil and gas, polluting the planet, causing tens of thousands of cancers, and destroying the biosphere, because, after all, we wouldn't want to cut the revenue to a vital industry, would we? Republicans even think that Americans will believe them when they say that the Green New Deal will mean we all have to stop eating hamburgers and flying, and must turn our cars over to ""jackbooted thugs from the big government.""
A solid majority of Americans think women should make their own decisions on birth control and abortion, and that America should do more to provide prenatal care, and nine out of 10 Americans think we should offer government-funded free pre-K daycare. But Republicans point to the states they run, like Mississippi where a woman is more likely to die in childbirth than in Bosnia or Botswana, and tell us that this is just how things have to be. Only by outlawing all abortion, Mississippi Republican Governor Phil Bryant tells us , can Mississippi become ""the safest place in America for an unborn child."" Nothing else will work; we've lost that ""take a man to the moon and bring him home safely"" intellect we used to have.
Whether it's strengthening environmental regulations, breaking up monopolies , restraining CEO pay , fully funding our public schools, or getting money out of politics -- all things that have been done by most if not all of the fully developed countries in the world -- Republicans tell us we just can't do those things here in America. We're just not that intelligent.
The story goes that Lincoln, during his debates with Stephen Douglas, said , ""You can fool all the people some of the time, and some of the people all the time, but you cannot fool all the people all the time.""
Clearly the modern Republican Party, its billionaire funders and its media oligarchs have decided to stick with Lincoln's logic. As long as they can fool some of the people all of the time, they don't give a rat's ass about the rest of us; that's enough to win elections, particularly if they can continue to strategically suppress millions of votes.
They have their plan, and they're sticking to it. They're really, really smart. - Advertisement -

So Biden got up with his usual grin And said, ""That's a classic political sin. You should always look down 'fore taking a chair, 'Specially with wise-guys like ol' Bernie there, Who think they've given a permanent shove, To our party's core and the nation thereof."" . And striking bold stance leaning on the chair's back, He said, ""I'll just stand, since you all show a lack Of true recognition of what I stand for: Civil rights, health care, and concern for the poor, All that I fought for when you guys were teenies, The prob' being then we had Bush and his meanies."" . Bernie said, ""Hold on, Joe, you're stretching too far, You're selling a rusted bald-tire used car. Sure, you have some qualities worthy of Dems, But of them your leftist cred much haws and hems. Miss America might for dog-catcher run, But lose on a platform of fashion and fun. . ""So if you're planning the Centrist Waddle, With HRC as your political model, Remember her message did squat on the stump, And got mashed to fodder by sleaze-master Trump, So this time around we do poor versus rich: That's the best way to leave Don in the ditch."" . But Joe said ""No, there's room for us all,"" And gave the table a mighty great haul Back to the center and admonished the rest To support his nom' after he's won the quest, Which he might do when it's all said and done, And means that Trump has re-election near won."
