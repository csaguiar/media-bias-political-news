Hacker group posts hundreds of law officer records,www.nbcnews.com,,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/hacker-group-posts-hundreds-law-officer-records-n994231,"BOSTON — Authorities were investigating Saturday the online posting by a hacker group of the personal information of hundreds of federal agents and police officers apparently stolen from websites affiliated with alumni of the FBI's National Academy. The Associated Press counted at least 1,400 unique records of employees of the FBI, Secret Service, Capitol Police, U.S. Park Police and other federal agencies as well as police and sheriffs' deputies in North Carolina and Florida. The records included home addresses and phone numbers, emails and employers' names.
Hackers posted hundreds of law enforcement officers' records online, authorities said. Al Drago / Bloomberg via Getty Images file The FBI National Academy Associates said in a statement that the information, posted late Thursday, appears to come from the websites of three local chapters of the nonprofit, which claims nearly 17,000 members nationwide and in 174 countries.
It said it was working with federal authorities to investigate.
The group said its national database was unaffected. It said the three affected chapters were using third-party software but said it was ""too early to determine if this impacted the breach.""
""If it is determined that there has been felonious activity, we well prosecute the culprits to the fullest extent of the law,"" said the group, which is based in Quantico, Virginia, home to the academy.
The AP is not identifying the hackers' website. A linked Twitter account says the group is based in Ukraine.
The hack was first reported by the news site TechCrunch.

In Texas two children, ages 8 and 3, died when a tree fell on a car Saturday afternoon, trapping them inside, according to the Angelina County Sheriff's Department. They were pronounced dead at the scene. In West Monroe, Louisiana, a 13-year-old boy drowned in a drainage area in what officials believe was a weather-related incident, said Glen Springfield, spokesman for the Ouachita Parish Sheriff's Office. Several streets were closed in the city of around 13,000 and a flood warning had been issued for the area, officials said. A fourth person who died in the storms was a woman killed by weather-related debris near the community of Weches in Houston County, Texas, the sheriff’s office said. The age of the woman was not released. Weches is west of Nacogdoches. A man in his mid-to-late 80s also died over the weekend in Monroe County, Mississippi, according to volunteer fire coordinator Terry Tucker. Tucker did not disclose the exact cause of his death other than to say it was weather-related. 83 million people under threat of tornadoes, strong winds and flooding April 14, 2019 00:59 In Franklin, Texas, a tornado touched down and destroyed homes Saturday, injuring about a dozen people described as walking wounded and sending two people to the emergency room, Robertson County Sheriff Gerald Yezak said. ""A strip of homes on the other side of town over here are completely gone, just gone, everything is gone,"" Robertson County Emergency Management Coordinator Billy Huggins said. The National Weather Service's Fort Worth office tweeted that after a preliminary damage assessment, the tornado in Robertson County was estimated to have a peak intensity of EF-3 with winds of 140 mph. The damage survey will continue over the next several days, the service said. Huggins said he got a call from the National Weather Service around 11:20 a.m. about a storm system that was on the ground and headed towards Franklin. ""We started trying to get people activated to get eyeballs on it, and by then the thing was moving fast and it went right through town,” he said. The weather service said severe thunderstorms from east Texas to Arkansas were possible Saturday, and the threat of severe weather will then affect the Ohio Valley into the southeastern U.S. on Sunday. Angelina County is around 120 miles north of Houston, and Franklin, a town of about 1,500, is about 110 miles northwest of Houston. In Alto, Texas, Marry Lamar with the volunteer fire department said a suspected tornado touched down Saturday, and several people were injured. The front wall of a gym at a school was blown off as were windows and doors at a fire house, Lamar said. Video posted on social media showed trees and power lines down and homes damaged in the town of just over 1,200 people. Meteorologist John Moore said a possible twister touched down Saturday in the Vicksburg, Mississippi, area, the Associated Press reported. No injuries were reported, but officials said several businesses and vehicles were damaged. Vicksburg Mayor George Flaggs Jr. told NBC affiliate WLBT the storms “just came in all at once” with heavy winds and rain. ""It was like it was a war zone; I’ve never seen nothing like it my life,"" Flaggs told the station. ""It looked like everyone was safe,” he said. “It's unbelievable. We’ve been blessed. What we’re going to do now is begin to recover."" He said power crews were working to restore electricity to around 1,700 customers, and he asked people to not panic and to use caution when using alternate power sources like generators.

""Unfortunately, the western half of the state may have a few tornadoes before sunrise while many people are in bed,"" meteorologist Jim Stefkovich said in a statement . In Roberston County, Texas, the damage in Franklin was called “devastating” by Huggins, the emergency management coordinator. He said that everyone has been accounted for. ""To this small town of Franklin, it's very devastating, how we're going to get people help to restore their homes that don’t have insurance or what have you, it's going to be pretty difficult,"" he said.

Oprah Winfrey, Stevie Nicks, and Condoleezza Rice. Reuters, AP, Getty Get the Know Your Value newsletter. SUBSCRIBE April 12, 2019, 6:01 PM GMT By Julianne Pepitone Kate Kaufmann always planned to have children. Never did she imagine that she’d spend years researching and writing about women who — just like her — aren’t mothers in a culture that expects it. Over the decades after her infertility journey, Kaufmann found women who aren’t mothers (by choice or circumstance) face unique challenges when it comes to managing their careers. “It’s a part of the conversation we don’t know how to have,” said Kaufmann, author of the new book “Do You Have Kids? Life When the Answer is No.” “There are stigmas and stereotypes on both sides, and it’s a shame, because as women the experiences we all have are so rich."" Kaufmann and other experts Know Your Value spoke to noted we don’t even have a great word to describe these women in conversations about parenthood. Non-mothers? Child-free or childless? They all describe women in terms of the absence of motherhood. According to Kate Kaufmann, ""There's an assumption that if you don't have kids you have more time available."" DelPozo Photography What's more, there's a pervasive double standard for women. Melanie Notkin, author of “Otherhood: Modern Women Finding A New Kind of Happiness ,"" who is childless by circumstance, feels people sometimes think that means ""I am a quote-unquote ‘career woman.’” About 14 percent of women in the age bracket 40 to 44 — generally considered the end of the childbearing years — are not mothers, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data . In the celebrity realm, several high-profile women have proudly discussed their child-free status in recent years, including Oprah Winfrey, Lily Tomlin, Condoleezza Rice and Stevie Nicks. Whether you’re childless, child-free, or unsure about whether you want to or will become a mother, here’s what you need to know about managing your career. Career opportunities Increased ability to take career risks: Without the inherent ties of kids who depend on you, taking risks can be more appealing compared to those who are parents. Jenn Seva, 48, who works in business development at a gaming company in Seattle and does not have children by choice, recalled the flexibility to consider a job that would have taken her away from the man who would later become her husband for more than two years. “I have the privilege to allow myself to be ... well, what some people stigmatize as selfish,” Seva said. “But I’ve given myself the power to prioritize what I want, and put that at the center of my decisions.” Jenn Seva, 48, lives in Seattle and says she is childfree by choice. Holla Roa Higher earnings: Without the need for maternity leave or taking significant time off to raise children, women without kids are more likely to have continuous careers. Some analyses of the gender wage gap conclude this difference is key: A 2014 study that analyzed pay data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics found that married women without children earn 93 cents to a child-free man’s dollar. But married mothers with young kids earn only 76 cents on that dollar. Potentially reduced risk of burnout: Anyone, with or without children, can spend too much time working. And we all have personal lives to balance with the responsibilities of the office. But for those who aren’t parents, work days aren’t punctuated by helping with homework or lengthy bedtime routines. Generally, your downtime is your own to de-stress, unplug and do what you feel like. Jane Terzis, 68, is a fine artist living in Portland. Courtesy of Jane Terzis. Jane Terzis, 68, a fine artist who now lives in Portland, Oregon, enjoyed a fruitful career as an art professor, prison arts program director, yoga studio owner, freelance illustrator and more. Terzis is childless by circumstance after spending 10 years on an infertility journey that included traveling from Juneau to Seattle for treatments. “Days in academia are long, and for a few years there I came home practically falling on my face every night,” Terzis said. “But I came home to a husband who’d made me dinner and then we could relax and watch a movie, or I could go right to bed. Of course I worked with mothers who managed it, but looking back, it’s really hard to imagine getting through it while caring for a child."" Workplace pitfalls to watch for Assumptions that you can work nights, weekends, whenever: Colleagues and bosses may assume women without kids are always available for that weekend shift, the late meeting or the overnight call with India. “There’s an assumption that if you don’t have kids you have more time available,” Kaufmann said. “On a general level that might be true, but of course these women have their own rich lives. [In researching the book,] I was struck by how many women I interviewed are deeply involved in their communities. Or you might have a parent with dementia, or health concerns yourself. Your time is not less valuable.” Notkin, the “Otherhood” author, cautioned that women may have to speak up. “I actually had to say to my [former] boss, having these meetings at 6 and 7 p.m. isn’t helping my own career and dreams and it isn’t sustainable for me,” said Notkin, who now runs her own business. Melanie Notkin, author of ""Otherhood: Modern Women Finding A New Kind of Happiness."" Ana Gambuto “I actually had to say to my boss, having these meetings at 6 and 7 p.m. isn’t helping my own career and dreams and it isn’t sustainable for me,” Notkin said. “Because people assume things about a female employee — that no one needs her, that she has nothing going on — the reality is that sometimes you need to address it. It doesn’t have to be confrontational, just matter-of-fact with examples.” Feelings of “otherhood”: Particularly at workplaces with several women of childbearing age, “there will be conversations you’ll feel left out of and celebrations where you'll feel sidelined,” Kaufmann said. Office baby showers may be particularly difficult for people who are childless by circumstance. Terzis, the artist and former professor, once experienced a “baby boom” in which five of the 17 faculty in her department were expecting babies at the same time: “Baby showers were tough,” she said. “It wasn’t until 10 years ago, when I was nearly 60, that I finally gave myself permission to not attend any more baby showers.” Beyond the one-off celebrations, constant feelings of being outside of the peer group culture can be even more challenging. “There’s a group of moms at work who definitely bond over that; they have a friendship on this very intimate level,” said Seva, the gaming company manager. “If a new mom is coming back to work and the breast pump isn’t working, that’s a private thing they’re going to discuss. I get that. But the result is that some people are in the inner circle, and I as a non-mom am on the outside.” Connecting with other colleagues outside of the mom group can be a way to cope. Finding other common ground to bond with the women who are mothers is another effective tool. Stigmas and stereotypes that can bleed into work: But those mothers may inadvertently make assumptions about what their child-free and childless counterparts want to hear about. Several women told Know Your Value they would have been happy to hear about their colleagues’ kids, but they felt people assume they don’t care or even that they hate children. They talked about being left out not only of first birthday parties in their social lives, but discussions at the workplace. “It’s like, ‘Of course I care what’s going on with you! You’re my colleague!’” Seva said. “There are times I’d be happy to pick up any slack, or take that late call, to help you out. But I can’t if I don’t know about it.” Seva compared it to “framing the world like a sitcom: We put people in their little boxes and make assumptions about the way this kind of person is. To change the conversation, you have to be part of it — and often, we don’t even make it to that step.” The decisions and circumstances surrounding parenthood are deeply personal, so it isn’t surprising that the conversations are difficult — especially at the office. But, Kaufmann agreed, that’s why stigmas fester and stereotypes persist. “It’s a conversation that doesn’t feel comfortable, which means there’s room for all of us to learn and explore,” Kaufmann said. “There is inequity on both sides, and stereotypes about all kinds of women. To change it, that means stepping right into it.” MORE FROM knowyourvalue "

He wanted big dogs, he said, and was drawn to the wolf-like appearance of the breed. A few weeks later Mulhall received a call from HBO that would change his life — and that of his dogs.
Odin and Thor are now better known to ""Game of Thrones"" fans as Grey Wind and Summer, the dire wolves of central characters Robb and Bran Stark.
Their roles in the show transformed the dogs from household pets into superstars.
They now have their own Instagram account, have been visited by over 400,000 tourists and are insured for more than $1 million each.
For locals like Mulhall, the show is much more than an epic tale of battles, ice zombies and dragons.
Related Opinion Opinion 'Game of Thrones' trailer breakdown: What HBO does — and does not — want us to know about season eight Over the course of eight seasons, ""Game of Thrones"" was filmed in more than 49 locations throughout Northern Ireland. From historic castles to rugged coastlines and ancient forests, the sites have grown popular with fans eager to visit — and meet the real dire wolves.
Ace Del Cruz was so excited he could barely speak after petting Odin and Thor. “Seeing the dire wolves, you get to pet them, just seeing them is so amazing,"" said Del Cruz, a Philippines native and show enthusiast. ""I can’t even pronounce what I want to say.”
“It is kind of surreal that they were in ‘Game of Thrones’ and they are here,” said Susan Hewitt from Essex, England.
Tourism has become big business for Northern Ireland, with the show helping to attract 120,000 visitors a year and bringing in $40 million annually to the local economy.
Mulhall now runs a successful company, DireWolf Tours, that in addition to featuring his beloved dogs takes fans to key sites across the region.
“It has taken over our lives,” he said. “Every day ‘Game of Thrones’ is playing some part in my life, and it just got bigger and bigger and madder and madder and it keeps going on!”
William van der Kells runs a similar business nearby at Castle Ward, which is better known to ""Thrones"" viewers as Winterfell — the home of the Stark family. Van der Kells teaches tourists to shoot arrows and throw axes.

— NI Greenways (@nigreenways) April 17, 2017 For many, however, the positive attention is preferable to the way things were before. For decades, Northern Ireland struggled to draw visitors, with many people associating the country with the decadeslong sectarian conflict known as ""the Troubles,"" even after it largely ended in 1998.
Van der Kells believes ""Game of Thrones"" has helped alter that perception. “We had 40 years of violence. People have got killed, maimed, injured. Now we have fantasy violence, and it is bringing in more money.”
Rosemary McHugh of Tourism NI, the government's official tourism body, agreed. “It has given us that new narrative … which makes Northern Ireland a more exciting place,"" she said. ""It has put our landscapes and our heritage out there in an exciting way.”
How Brexit could push N. Ireland to the brink Jan. 11, 2019 06:14 The show has brought benefits beyond tourism, too, providing ample employment opportunities.
Nearly 13,000 extras have been used during shooting in the country according to HBO, including Mulhall and his brothers. Their father, boasting a long silver beard, played a Dothraki slave-master.
Much of the cast, including stars Kit Harrington and Maisie Williams, have been guests at The Cuen Inn in the village of Strongmore.
The owner, Caroline McEarlean, now serves a popular ""Game of Thrones banquet"" complete with alcohol served in locally produced goblets modeled after those used by the show’s wealthy Lannister family.
This attention to detail has paid off. “It is phenomenal. It is the most significant financial impact that in our 29 years of business we have ever experienced,” she said. “And it’s not going away.”
Everyone from casting agents to taxidermists has enjoyed a bit of the action. The total benefit to the Northern Irish economy is estimated to be over $240 million over the past decade.
But while winter has arrived for the show's characters, Northern Ireland residents are confident the ""Game of Thrones"" boom will not die when season 8 ends.
“There is going to be a legacy,"" van der Kells said. ""The thing has got such cult status now I think people will come over and over again.""

Soccer in the spotlight as Europe grapples with racism on and off the field,www.nbcnews.com,,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/soccer-spotlight-europe-grapples-racism-field-n992911,"World Soccer in the spotlight as Europe grapples with racism on and off the field A growing number of young stars are speaking out as stories of players facing abuse from fans, both on the field and online, have gained attention in recent weeks.

Carl recine / Reuters Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. SUBSCRIBE April 14, 2019, 7:29 AM GMT By Patrick Smith LONDON — At 24, Linton Harris’ soccer career is over. But it's not injury that's caused him to hang up his cleats, it's racism. While playing for the tiny amateur team Wymeswold FC in a local county cup final last Wednesday — a far cry from the glitz and glamour of England's Premier League — Harris claims he was subjected to racist shouts, including monkey noises. Harris was later sent off. ""Typical black man, ruining the game,"" someone was heard to shout from the crowd as he made his way from the field. What happened next was almost unheard of: A teammate was then sent off for supporting Harris — he was appealing to the referee, who had not stopped the game — and the entire team then walked off with 12 minutes still remaining. The game was abandoned. Harris has scored 46 goals this season, helping Wymeswold win its league. But, he says, he really is quitting. ""Oh yeah, definitely, 100 percent — I'm done with playing football altogether,"" he told NBC News. ""It's just getting worse and worse."" This story of abuse in front of a small number of fans may not grab many headlines. But it comes at a time when racism in British and European soccer is very much back in the spotlight. Stories of players facing abuse from fans, both on the field and online , have gained attention in recent weeks. It's unclear whether this is due to an increase in racist abuse around the game, or simply an increase in the attention paid to such incidents. But what does seem to be changing is that a growing number of young stars are speaking out. And Harris is not the only one considering walking away from the beautiful game after being exposed to its ugly side. Danny Rose, a Tottenham and England defender, said last week that he is looking forward to retiring so he doesn't have to deal with the abuse and all the politics that surrounds it. ""At the minute, how I program myself is that I just think: 'I've got five or six more years left in football and I just can’t wait to see the back of it,'"" he told the media after a number of black England players were subjected to racist chants from home fans during a game in Montenegro. ""Seeing how things are done in the game at the minute, it’s just — whatever, isn’t it? I just want to get out of it."" Raheem Sterling, 24, is fed up, too. And with the added prominence that comes with each match-winning performance for Premier League giants Manchester City, he is making his voice heard. Best way to silence the haters (and yeah I mean racists) 🙉😘 #2019 #getsomeeducation pic.twitter.com/ohhkOJtdey — Raheem Sterling (@sterling7) March 25, 2019 After scoring England’s fifth goal in a 5-1 win over Montenegro, Sterling walked toward the fans with his hands to his ears — a direct response to the racist taunting, he later confirmed. Sterling 's talent saw him first rise to prominence as a teenager. He is the subject of consistent scrutiny from the British tabloids, and many have argued that his media treatment is worse than that given to white players of his generation. A number of recent incidents on the field have prompted Sterling to become an eloquent spokesman for black players, calling for greater punishment for teams and fans who transgress. Raheem Sterling of Manchester City discusses racism, the relentlessness of media stereotypes about black players and his decision to call out both after he was racially abused during a Premier League match in December https://t.co/X7k8RMyQcC — The New York Times (@nytimes) March 11, 2019 A spokesperson for Kick it Out, a charity devoted to fighting discrimination in the sport, told NBC News that officials rarely, if ever, follow the correct procedure when racist chanting or behavior is reported during a match. ""Players are being failed by the football authorities,"" the spokesperson said. ""Players are not being protected and it's only a matter of time before they take matters into their own hands and do things like walk off."" For many, the recent instances of racist abuse are a grim reminder of the past, and a sad indictment of a soccer culture that many thought had outgrown such ugly discrimination. Trailblazing black players regularly had to endure monkey chants and banana skins being thrown at them on the field in the 1970s and the 1980s. ""In football, I think we operate in what I call a 'white habitus,' which means that apart from the players, the majority of people who watch the game are white,"" said Jamie Cleland, a British academic at the University of South Australia, who has studied discrimination in sport. ""Throughout football history whiteness has been a key part of the game."" ""In the 1980s, people would throw bananas at players, and what's happening now is very overt monkey chanting such as at the England vs Montenegro game — and social media is creating another outlet for these 'fans,' to use the term broadly, to express these racist thoughts,"" he added. Cyril Regis was one of the first high-profile black players to make it at the elite level. ""As a player, I just made sure I did not crumble from the abuse; that was my way of fighting back,"" he said in 2002. The idea of silencing racists on the field and then letting the authorities deal with the aftermath is popular among many professionals. England is far from alone in dealing with the problem. A recent incident in Italy went viral on social media, leading to a similar debate over how best to respond to the issue. Moise Kean — a talented young forward for Italian champions Juventus — gestured to opposition fans with his arms outstretched after scoring in a game earlier this month, an apparent act of defiance in reaction to racist chants. While Kean's reaction was not dissimilar to Sterling's, the response of his teammates was. Veteran defender Leonardo Bonucci said the blame for any racist taunts was split ""50-50"" between the fans and Kean himself. Coach Massimiliano Allegri even said Kean ""shouldn't have celebrated in that manner."" Their reactions were widely criticized. For his part, Sterling said in a press conference this week that walking off the pitch would only let the racists win. ""To win the game would hurt them even more,"" he said. ""They're only trying to get you down."" Patrick Smith"

The Lyrid meteor shower is back. Here's how to see April's shooting stars.,www.nbcnews.com,,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/mach/science/lyrid-meteor-shower-back-here-s-how-see-april-s-ncna993891,"April brings the return of the annual Lyrid meteor shower . Skywatchers may be able to see the shooting stars, though experts say the full moon threatens to upstage this year’s show. “The light from the full moon is pretty much going to completely wash out the Lyrids this year,” Bill Cooke, a meteor expert at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, said in an email.
The Lyrids — so named because they appear to stream from the constellation Lyra — begin on the evening of April 16 and continue through April 28. The action will peak on the night of April 22, when — moonlight and weather permitting — viewers may be able to see about 20 meteors an hour.
In some previous years, skywatchers reported seeing as many as 100 meteors an hour .
Related Space Space First-ever photo of a black hole reveals what had been unseeable Meteor showers occur when bits of fast-moving debris from a comet collide with Earth’s atmosphere as our planet travels around the sun. As the grains of rock and dust smash into air molecules, they quickly heat up to temperatures as high as 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit (1,650 degrees Celsius) — and create dazzling streaks across the sky as they burn up.
“I kind of like thinking about the fact that the particles burning up in our atmosphere during a shower have been orbiting the sun for centuries, finally hitting the top of our atmosphere and going out in a streak of light,” Cooke said.
In the case of the Lyrids, the debris comes from comet C/1861 G1, or Comet Thatcher, which was named for the amateur astronomer A. E. Thatcher, who first spotted the comet April 5, 1861.
No special equipment is needed to see shooting stars. ""All you have to do is lie on your back and look straight up — pretty easy,” Cooke said. Just make sure to pick a viewing spot away from city and street lights — and put aside your smartphone.
“Observing meteors requires letting your eyes adapt to the dark, so one does not want to be looking at the screen of a phone or tablet,” he said. “That also takes your attention away from the sky.”

"For 'Game of Thrones' superfans and devoted conspiracy theorists: Similar psychology, different outcomes.",www.nbcnews.com,Ben Kesslen,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/internet/game-thrones-superfans-devoted-conspiracy-theorists-similar-psychology-different-outcomes-n994006,"On Reddit, some “Game of Thrones” fans subscribe to a tortuous theory that a group of old, scholarly men — the maesters — are part of a sprawling and hidden conspiracy to exert control over the show’s mythical kingdom. They write thousands of words to each other proving that every obscure clue adds up to a big picture that only they can see. Just a few clicks away, other Reddit users are sure that a secretive group — the Illuminati — is part of a sprawling and hidden conspiracy to control the real world. They do exactly the same thing.
There are some clear parallels between fan conspiracy theories and political conspiracy theories. They were once confined to the far corners of American culture, but in recent years have flourished thanks in part to internet message boards and social media, which offer anyone the opportunity to publish, debunk, rebunk and remix their own imaginary concepts and share them with like-minded theorists.
The theories, however, share more than just message boards. The psychology of groups and the internet’s propensity to amplify outlandish content and reward the people who create it has created the kind of feedback loops in which bizarre theories — from both fantasy fans and the politically paranoid — flourish.
Russell Zimmerman, 41, a writer, game developer and military historian, loves to theorize about “Game of Thrones,” particularly the books on which it is based, George R.R. Martin’s series, “A Song of Ice and Fire.” But some theories are even too much for him, such as one that argues one character (Varys, the spymaster) is secretly a sea creature .
Zimmerman compared the fan theory to a real-life conspiracy theory.
“To me, that's about the level of ‘out there’ crazy-talk as assuming there's a kiddie porn ring in the basement of a pizza shop without a basement,” he said, referring to the “pizzagate” conspiracy theory that remains popular on the fringes of the far right.
'Game of Thrones' fans gear up for the hit show's end April 12, 2019 02:16 “Thrones” is not the only show with a strong internet following and crackpot theories.
The popular Adult Swim show “Rick and Morty” has various fan guesses at the show’s secrets. BBC’s “Doctor Who,” which follows a time-traveling human-looking alien exploring the universe, has its own theories . And in the early days of the consumer internet, “ The X-Files ,” a show that often touched on real-life conspiracy theories, gave birth to some of the first online fan theories .
Meanwhile, any number of real-world conspiracy theories have taken hold among various political and social groups on the internet.
Joseph Uscinski, associate professor of political science at the University of Miami and author of “Conspiracy Theories and the People Who Believe Them,” said diehard fans and conspiracy theorists share a love of extrapolating from the facts in their possession.
“Conspiracy theories are similar to fan fiction in that they both allow people to make up whatever they want,” he said.
Uscinski said that whether it’s “Game of Thrones,” “Star Wars” or the JFK assassination, people can take a plot or an event and “go to wherever they want with it.”
As an example, Uscinski cited Qanon, a remarkably popular genre of conspiracy theories that generally center on a mysterious figure who claims that President Donald Trump is working to uncover a powerful group of pedophiles.
“You have this anonymous poster, Q, who puts out nonsensical clues and people try to make sense of it and try to figure out what happens next,” he said. “They are enjoying this. They like piecing these things together. It’s a fan thing for them.”
Brendon Boutin, 32, who runs a popular “Game of Thrones” recap channel, “Man of Recaps,” said the excitement generated by both kinds of theories drove their popularity.
“I think the biggest similarity is the feeling you get, the rush of hunting for the truth and discovering secret knowledge,” Boutin said by email. “I watched some 9/11 ‘Truth’ videos back in the day, and those brought about the same thrill as discovering Jon Snow's parentage.”
“Game of Thrones” is far from the only show to have a fervent fanbase that has created its own theories, but few have created a community as rich and active, both online and off. Laurel Steinberg, a New York-based relationship therapist, said the behavior shown by conspiracy theorists and superfans is “absolutely analogous.”
The only conspiracy theories I entertain are from Game of Thrones
— Brandon (@JealousCloud) April 5, 2019 “People like to feel part of a group, part of a movement, part of a team,” Steinberg said. “It feels good to have something that gives them a identity. It feels good to have something to be excited about, and watch develop in real time.”
But “Thrones” fandom is also susceptible to the same internet dynamics that have spurred ever-more outlandish conspiracy theories, rewarding people who can draw the most attention.
“You're able to create community, and then become an expert. You’ve ridden the tailcoats of the star and then you become a breakout star in that community,” Steinberg said.”You become an influencer.”
Chloe Ketchum, 27, who co-hosts a podcast about the series, “Girls Gone Canon,” said that while she enjoys the feeling of community around “Game of Thrones,” she’s also seen the lengths some fans will go to attract a following.
“There are creators that push shock value to get views,” Ketchum said. “People will do anything for attention.”
While there are similarities in the psychology behind intense fandoms and political conspiracists, Uscinski stressed that they result in divergent behaviors. He said fans will generally abandon theories that don’t hold up, whereas conspiracy theorists ignore evidence that proves them wrong.
There’s also the real-world consequences. Conspiracy theories around politics and current events have inspired some people to commit acts of violence , which has led to efforts by politicians and activist groups to force internet platforms to reign in the spread of the disinformation that can fuel the theories.
“When the show comes out, people will disregard their theories that didn’t turn out to be true,” he said. “But with flat earthers, when they do an experiment and it doesn’t show them what they want, they still hold that belief anyway. They’re much more invested”

Active shooter drills are scaring kids and may not protect them. Some schools are taking a new approach.,www.nbcnews.com,Elizabeth Chuck,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/active-shooter-drills-are-scaring-kids-may-not-protect-them-n992941,"Heidi Lee Pottinger’s 5-year-old son was at a football game last fall with his father when, following a touchdown, celebratory fireworks rocketed into the sky. Panicked by the popping sounds, the little boy turned to his dad. “Active shooter!” he cried, tears in his eyes.
Pottinger’s son is one of millions of schoolchildren in America who have done active shooter and lockdown drills. The exercises, a legacy of the April 20, 1999, Columbine High School rampage, are intended to prepare teachers and students for the rare threat of a gunman opening fire in their school.
Pottinger’s son started doing the drills at his private nursery-through-eighth-grade school when he was just 3. During the drills, the Tucson, Arizona, youngster — whom Pottinger asked NBC News not to name to protect his privacy — would quietly crouch with his classmates and teachers behind furniture, rehearsing what to do if a real shooter were to burst in.
The drills affected him deeply. At home, he bit his nails and did pretend lockdowns while he was playing. Eventually, he refused to go anywhere alone, even to his room or a bathroom at home.
“He would say, ‘The lockdown is going to get me,’” Pottinger, a maternal and child researcher at the University of Arizona College of Public Health, said. “It just really caught me off guard. ... This is his childhood and it should be carefree, and it’s not.”
Active shooter drills have become more common as school gun massacre after massacre has made headlines. The drills give teachers and students a blueprint to follow during emergencies, which may save lives . Forty-two states have laws requiring some sort of emergency or safety drills in schools, many of which are designed to protect against active shooters, according to the nonprofit Education Commission of the States.
But there is hardly any research on the drills’ effectiveness, and while there are some federal recommendations , there is no standard template for schools to follow in terms of how to do them, how often to conduct them and how to explain them to students of different ages.
Over the past two decades, the drills have ramped up in intensity — with some schools going so far as to use fake blood and fire blanks at students . A drill last month at an Indiana school prompted outrage when teachers were shot execution-style with pellet guns , leaving them injured.
Related News News Indiana teachers hurt by Airsoft guns used in active shooter drill say sheriffs went too far At the same time, students’ anxieties have swelled. Some are not told that the lockdowns are just drills, prompting them to send what they believe are final goodbyes over text to their parents or faint or throw up . Others are afraid to go to school in the days following the drills.
As a result, a growing number of schools are experimenting with ways to lessen the toll of the drills while still doing everything possible to keep students safe. For some school districts, that means using age-appropriate language; for others, it involves having guidance counselors or school psychologists available during and after the drills.
But even relatively tame active shooter drills with plenty of warning can traumatize students, critics say, raising the question of whether schools should do them at all.
“Children are much more likely to be abused by a parent than shot at school, to be in a car accident, to be screamed at by a teacher. We don’t practice that.”
“Children are much more likely to be abused by a parent than shot at school, to be in a car accident, to be screamed at by a teacher. We don’t practice that,” said Joy Levinson, a New York City-based clinical psychologist who has had elementary-age clients tell her they wet their pants in class because drills made them afraid to go down the hall to the bathroom.
“It causes school to feel unsafe, like a place we can’t learn,” she said. “That’s what schools are for.”
Borrowing police and prison lingo for schools Virtually all public schools in America teach students some form of emergency preparedness, ranging from fire and tornado drills to mock lockdowns.
While drills date back decades — students in the 1950s dove under their desks during the Cold War’s “duck-and-cover” nuclear bomb drills — it was only in the past 20 years that “active shooter” and “lockdown” entered the educational lexicon.
Originally a recreational hunting term, “active shooter” became part of law enforcement’s vocabulary after Columbine. The general public, including schools, started using the term several years later, according to Northeastern University criminologist James Alan Fox. At first, schools simply called the exercises “Columbine drills,” he said.
Students and faculty run out of Columbine High School during a shooting rampage by two teenagers on April 20, 1999. Gary Caskey / Reuters, file “Lockdown” drills, borrowed from prison jargon, later became regularly used to refer to a rehearsal for anything that might require students and teachers to stay put in a classroom with locked doors, closed windows, lights turned off and blinds drawn — such as nearby police activity, a natural disaster or an active shooter.
No matter what they’re called, the objective of the drills is clear: to protect students and teachers.
Fox argues that there is no way to prove active shooter drills work, because it would be impossible to conduct such an experiment. But some who have come face to face with gun violence say they are certain the drills saved lives.
When a gunman rushed toward a schoolyard full of children at Rancho Tehama Elementary in Corning, California, in November 2017, staff immediately ushered students inside. They implemented lockdown procedures they had rehearsed as the gunman shot at the building.
One student was shot in the chest and foot and survived. But no one else was hurt — something Corning Union Elementary School District Superintendent Richard Fitzpatrick credited to staff, who he said “flawlessly” locked down the school after years of practice.
Many parents also support drills, saying it’s necessary for children to understand the dangers they could face.
“I think it’s important to have a plan,"" Sarah Caron, whose son survived the Sandy Hook Elementary shooting in 2012, told Today.com last year, ""even if it is ultimately deviated from.”
Are drills causing more harm than good? Still, the backlash to active shooter drills has grown, amid criticism that they are particularly traumatic for children given that it’s hard to shield them from news coverage of mass shootings happening around the country.
“The tragedies are happening not just in public schools, but at a movie house down the street, at a nightclub,” said Lily Eskelsen Garcia, president of the National Education Association , which represents more than 3 million teachers and education support professionals.
“When they know what has happened from Columbine to Parkland and that crazed people have walked through schools,"" she said, ""this is something that reminds them, ‘I could be killed every time I walk into school,’ even if there is a .0001 chance that this will ever happen to them.” (Last year, the Washington Post estimated the odds of a public school student getting shot and killed since 1999 to be about 1 in 614,000,000.)
Related News News Parkland students mock new security measure — clear backpacks The lack of rules for the drills has also caused problems.
Some schools do not notify teachers and students in the days beforehand, based on state laws that require the drills to be conducted without prior warning. Once a drill starts, administrators might announce over the loudspeaker that it’s just an exercise. Or they might not: When two Wisconsin schools held “Code Red,” or school violence, drills in October 2018 without telling teachers and students that they were just drills, enraged parents wrote a letter to the school district , blaming it for “creating a false sense of trauma in staff and students for the sake of ‘making it seem real’ or in order to have people ‘take it seriously.’” (A bill introduced earlier this month would give Wisconsin school administrators the ability to warn students beforehand.)
Some worry that too much emphasis on active shooter drills comes at the expense of preparing for more probable situations that schools may face, such as a noncustodial parent trying to sign a child out of school, a pupil choking or an extreme weather event.
“What people should be practicing are functions,” Michael Dorn, executive director of school-safety consulting firm Safe Havens International, said. “What we suggest to people to do is you have an array of protective actions, lockdowns, evacuations, reverse evacuations, where you practice going back into the building when the danger is outside.”
He discouraged simulating real shootings, which may look very different in reality than they did during the simulation.
“It can have the reverse effect of what you want,” Dorn said. “You not only induce trauma, but people will be less able to survive if they encounter the real threat.”
‘Don’t be scared, be prepared’: Lessening the anxiety Some educators and school safety experts are experimenting with ways to minimize students’ stress.
At Liberty Central School District in Liberty, New York, the district’s motto for drills is “Don’t be scared, be prepared.” Teachers tell the more than 1,800 students in the district in advance about the drills, giving them a general time frame for when to expect them. They review their purpose, as well as the procedures, superintendent of schools Augustine Tornatore said.
“These are tough conversations to have, but it’s important elementary school students know that if something bad is happening, that they have a way of dealing with it,” he said.
But the district recognizes some children will still have anxiety during the drills, Tornatore said, so school guidance counselors, social workers and psychologists follow up with students afterward. There is also sensory support and occupational support in classrooms for students with special needs during the drills, such as giving a student who tends to feel anxious a ball to squeeze.
At the 6,800-student Oak Creek-Franklin joint school district just south of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, teachers tailor drills to the youngest students, calling them “buddy room drills” so they sound less scary. The term is used to practice anything that requires quickly moving, say from one classroom to another or inside from the playground, assistant superintendent for operations Daniel Unertl said.
Another option, according to some school safety experts, is to leave students out of active shooter drills altogether.
“There’s no evidence that they work, and if the real thing does happen, when adrenaline is pumping, all those lessons learned can be forgotten.”
Fox, the Northeastern criminologist, does not see how students benefit from them, arguing that teachers can learn just as well to practice for these events from their local police departments without students being traumatized in the process.
“There’s no evidence that they work, and if the real thing does happen, when adrenaline is pumping, all those lessons learned can be forgotten,” he said.
“It doesn’t mean you shouldn’t do anything — it would be just as effective if you just told kids what happens in the case of an active shooter,” he added, just as safety videos on planes don’t involve passengers actually rehearsing an evacuation.
Pottinger, the Arizona mom, said talking through her son’s fears and giving him coping strategies (including telling him to envision an imaginary cloud keeping watch over him) helped him to not be as nervous. She has switched her son to a preschool closer to home but does not blame his previous school, which she believes was just doing what administrators felt was in the kids’ best interest.
Still, she said, seeing the effect that the drills had on her son was “really concerning.”
“I do understand that these protocols are unfortunately becoming more normal and needed,” she said, “but I think there are other strategies that can be implemented.”

"Gun control case study: A mass shooting, major reforms, then a political backlash",www.nbcnews.com,Adam Edelman,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/gun-control-case-study-mass-shooting-major-reforms-then-political-n991096,"Former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper bills himself as the experienced, consensus-building Democrat in the 2020 presidential race, one who has successfully tackled divisive issues like gun control. But his signature achievement as governor — a package of gun bills passed in 2013 — was undertaken without any Republican support and exacted great political cost on state Democrats, several of whom were recalled or resigned under threat of being removed from office. Hickenlooper has since expressed serious misgivings about how he handled the issue, publicly pondering whether it was worth it and apologizing to one of the key players in the process — although he still touts it on the campaign trail as one of his major accomplishments.
It began on July 12, 2012, when James Holmes opened fire inside an Aurora, Colo., movie theater, killing 12 people and injuring 70 others. During the attack at a midnight showing of a ""The Dark Knight Rises,"" Holmes, who experts testified during his trial was mentally ill, wielded a modified semiautomatic AR-15 rifle, a 12-gauge shotgun and a .40-caliber semiautomatic pistol . He bought all the firearms legally .
Afterward, local and national gun-control groups, lawmakers and mental health advocates banded together to push tough gun control laws in a purple state where gun rights enjoyed significant support.
Their efforts were successful. After vigorous debate — and protests from pro-gun groups and gun-owning Coloradans — Hickenlooper signed three bills into law in 2013.
One, a so-called ""high-capacity magazine ban,"" limited ammunition magazines to 15 rounds. A second put in place universal background checks for all gun purchases , expanding the checks to sales and transfers between private parties and to online purchases. The third measure required gun purchasers to pay for the background checks.
Lawrence interviews presidential contender John Hickenlooper March 7, 2019 04:52 All three bills passed the state Senate and state House either entirely along party lines or with just one Democrat joining all Republicans in opposition . Four other bills, including an assault weapons ban, did not advance.
Republican opponents of the measures argued they infringed on Second Amendment rights and that state Democrats were doing the bidding of national gun control groups (which poured hundreds of thousands of dollars into the state during the process) and the Obama White House, which at the time was advocating for national gun control legislation in the aftermath of Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, Conn., in 2012.
The political price to be paid The Republican and gun group-led backlash came fast and furious.
Incensed with the new laws, the National Rifle Association, Rocky Mountain Gun Owners and other groups helped organize angry residents to gather enough signatures to force recall elections in the districts of two key Senate Democrats who had supported the gun control legislation.
Senate President John Morse, a former police officer representing a Colorado Springs-area district who had become a face of the bills, and Angela Giron, who represented a Pueblo-area district, were targeted.
Groups on both sides of the fight spent upwards of $3.5 million . Outside organizations were particularly aggressive : Mayors Against Illegal Guns, run by then-New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, spent $350,000 to help fight the recalls , while the NRA poured in $360,000 to support them.
Morse and Giron both lost their seats, and under the way the recall was structured, Republican replacements were elected on the same ballot, cutting the Democrats' majority in the state Senate to one seat.
Then, seeking a GOP takeover of the chamber, the same groups collected enough signatures in October to recall Democratic state Sen. Evie Hudak, who represented the northwest suburbs of Denver. Rather than face a recall, Hudak resigned — a move that, under Colorado state law, made sure the seat would stay in Democratic hands.
A year later, Colorado Democrats — still facing intense criticism over the gun reforms — lost control of the state Senate , along with several state House seats, and a U.S. Senate seat. Hickenlooper, however, won re-election.
‘AN INTERESTING TEST’ In interviews with NBC News, key players in the fight to pass the bills and defeat the recalls made it clear they were relentless in their efforts to make good on Hickenlooper's desired approach to engage those who opposed the proposals as part of the process. When they were stonewalled, they said the governor decided to take action anyway — a risk they knew would likely have enormous political costs for themselves but that was still worthwhile.
""We did everything we could to work across the aisle. There just wasn't any way to do it,"" Morse said in an interview. He recalled a meeting with several GOP state senators in which they told him, ""There is nothing to even talk about.""
Barb Whitfield and her grandson, Wanya Whitfield, visit a memorial to the victims of a movie theater shooting in Aurora, Colorado, on July 22, 2012. Chip ""There are plenty of times where you cannot make a deal with the devil and other times where you have no business making a deal with the devil,"" Morse said. ""This turned out to be both.""
Added Hudak, ""There was no bringing people together on the gun issues...There was no compromising with them.""
The NRA declined to comment. Rocky Mountain Gun Owners did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
Tony Fabian, the president of the Colorado State Shooting Association — another group that fought the bills and supported the recalls — said Hickenlooper ""didn't engage with us at all."" If he had, Fabian said, ""nothing short of vetoing"" the legislation would have been satisfactory.
""These were gun control bills. These weren't bills that could be fixed. These were bills that directly attacked the constitutional right to bear arms,"" added Fabian.
Roxane White, who served as Hickenlooper's chief of staff throughout the gun control debate and recalls, said they spent ""endless hours"" with Republican legislators, corrections officers, families affected by gun violence and gun groups on both sides of the debate.
""I suppose in retrospect we wish we'd had even more conversations and dialogue,"" she told NBC News. ""But minus a 26-hour day, I don't know if I think it would ever be possible. That said, we didn't anticipate the ferocity of the recalls that ensued.""
Hickenlooper later expressed dismay at the divisions the bills caused, and even hinted that he may not have gone through with signing the legislation if he'd foreseen the consequences.
""If we'd known it was going to divide the state so intensely, I think we probably would've thought about it twice,"" he told a conference of the County Sheriffs of Colorado in June 2014 .
He also apologized for not meeting with the group , which had opposed the bills, during the debate, and said he only signed the high-capacity magazine ban because a staffer had promised state lawmakers he would.
The saga offers clues on what could happen with a Democratic president who — if given a Democratic-controlled House and Senate in 2020 — might attempt federal gun control legislation using a similar model: By first trying to incorporate all interests and, when that fails, going it alone and risking the fallout.
A spokeswoman for the Hickenlooper campaign said she believes that voters looking at the former governor's record would understand ""getting things done"" can mean ""making tough decisions"" that have political fallout.
""When you're a doer,"" Lauren Hitt, the campaign communications director, told NBC News, ""sometimes you get things done the way you exactly wanted to do at the beginning, and other times you get them done whatever way they can get done.""
Others, however, predicted national Democrats — after massive failures on the issue following Sandy Hook — would never stake so much political capital on gun control, especially when considering what happened in Colorado.
""Colorado being a purple state, this was all kind of an interesting test,"" said Doug Friednash, who followed White as Hickenlooper's chief of staff as governor. ""What comes into play on a national level is that people in vulnerable seats have to think twice before they take that on. That's one of the primary reasons DC hasn't had an appetite to take gun control on.""
""Having a governor who has done it in a swing state is still a good thing. But does it mean he, or someone else for that matter, could walk in and build consensus?"" Friednash asked. ""It would take a lot of time. It's a very challenging path.""

"Measles outbreak kills 1,200 in Madagascar, where parents want to vaccinate but lack means",www.nbcnews.com,,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/measles-outbreak-kills-1-200-madagascar-where-parents-want-vaccinate-n994266,"World Measles outbreak kills 1,200 in Madagascar, where parents want to vaccinate but lack means In Madagascar, many parents would like to protect their vulnerable children but face immense challenges to receiving vaccines. Mothers wait to have their babies vaccinated against the measles at a healthcare center in Larintsena, Madagascar, on March 21, 2019. Laetitia Bezain / AP file Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. SUBSCRIBE April 14, 2019, 1:41 PM GMT By Associated Press AMBALAVAO, Madagascar — Babies wail as a nurse tries to reassure mothers who have come to vaccinate their children. They fear a measles epidemic that has killed more than 1,200 people in this island nation where many are desperately poor. As Madagascar faces its largest measles outbreak in history and cases soar well beyond 115,000, resistance to vaccinating children is not the driving force. Measles cases are rising in the United States and other parts of the world, in part the result of misinformation that makes some parents balk at a crucial vaccine. New York City is now trying to halt a measles outbreak by ordering mandatory vaccinations in one Brooklyn neighborhood . In Madagascar, many parents would like to protect their children but face immense challenges including the lack of resources. Just 58 percent percent of people on Madagascar's main island have been vaccinated against measles, a major factor in the outbreak's spread. With measles one of the most infectious diseases, immunization rates need to be 90 to 95 percent or higher to prevent outbreaks. On a recent day the Iarintsena health center's waiting room was full, with mothers sitting on the floor and others waiting outside in the overwhelming heat. Two volunteer nurses and a midwife tried to respond to the demand. Nifaliana Razaijafisoa had walked 15 kilometers (9 miles) with her 6-month-old baby in her arms. ""He has a fever,"" she said. ""I think it's measles because there are these little pimples that have appeared on his face."" The nurse quickly confirmed it. ""I'm so scared for him because in the village everyone says it kills babies,"" Razaijafisoa said. The measles outbreak has killed mostly children under age 15 since it began in September, according to the World Health Organization. ""The epidemic unfortunately continues to expand in size"" though at a slower pace than a month ago, said Dr. Dossou Vincent Sodjinou, a WHO epidemiologist in Madagascar. By mid-March, 117,075 cases had been reported by the health ministry, affecting all regions of the country. Some cases of resistance to vaccinations exist because of the influence of religion or of traditional health practitioners but they are isolated ones, he said. This epidemic is complicated by the fact that nearly 50 percent of children in Madagascar are malnourished. ""Malnutrition is the bed of measles,"" Sodjinou said. Razaijafisoa's baby weighs just 11 pounds. ""This is the case for almost all children with measles who have come here,"" said Lantonirina Rasolofoniaina, a volunteer at the health center. Simply reaching a clinic for help can be a challenge. Many people in Madagascar cannot afford to see a doctor or buy medicine, and health centers often are understaffed or have poorly qualified workers. As a result, information about health issues can be unreliable. Some parents are not aware that vaccines are free, at least in public health centers. Four of Erika Hantriniaina's five children have had measles. She had wrongly believed that people could not be vaccinated after nine months of age. ""It's my 6-year-old daughter who had measles first. She had a lot of fever,"" she said. ""I called the doctor but it was Friday. He had already gone to town. I went to see another doctor who told me that my daughter had an allergy. ... This misdiagnosis was almost fatal."" The girl had diarrhea and vomiting and couldn't eat, Hantriniaina said, adding that she narrowly survived. Measles, a highly infectious disease spread by coughing, sneezing, close contact or infected surfaces, has no specific treatment. The symptoms are treated instead. ""Vitamin A is given to children to increase their immunity. We try to reduce the fever. If there is a cough, we give antibiotics,"" said Dr. Boniface Maronko, sent by WHO to Madagascar to supervise efforts to contain the outbreak. If the disease is not treated early enough, complications appear including diarrhea, bronchitis, pneumonia and convulsions. Madagascar's health ministry has sent free medications to regions most affected by the epidemic. Maronko reminded heads of health centers in the Ambalavao region not to make parents pay, saying he had seen some doctors asking for money. He told the AP he feared the medicines wouldn't be enough. The country's capital, Antananarivo, a city of some 1.3 million, has not been spared by the epidemic. Lalatiana Ravonjisoa, a vegetable vendor in a poor district, grieves for her 5-month-old baby. ""I had 5 children. They all had measles. For the last, I did not go to see the doctor because I did not have money,"" she said. ""I gave my baby the leftover medications from his big brother to bring down the fever."" For a few days she did not worry: ""I felt like he was healed."" But one morning she noticed he had trouble breathing. Later she found his feet were cold. ""Look at my baby,"" she told her mother. ""She hugged him for a long time and she did not say anything. Then she asked me to be strong. He was gone."" Ravonjisoa said she blames herself, ""but I did not imagine for one moment that he was going to die."" At the hospital, a doctor confirmed that her baby died of measles-related respiratory complications. Late last month WHO started a third mass measles vaccination campaign in Madagascar with the overall goal of reaching 7.2 million children aged 6 months to 9 years. ""But immunization is not the only strategy for the response to this epidemic. We still need resources for care, monitoring and social mobilization,"" said Sodjinou, the WHO epidemiologist. "
Kellyanne Conway: 'Unserious Congress' is refusing to deal with border surge,www.nbcnews.com,msn.com,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/meet-the-press/kellyanne-conway-unserious-congress-refusing-deal-border-surge-n994306,"WASHINGTON — White House counselor Kellyanne Conway said Sunday that an “unserious Congress” is failing to help stem the surge of immigrants seeking entry into the U.S. at the southern border and defended President Donald Trump against criticism that his rhetoric has only contributed to the problem. Appearing on “Meet the Press,” Conway said Congress should spend less time reacting to “every single Donald Trump tweet” and work on legislation to prevent trafficking, give the administration more flexibility when it comes to detaining children and families for longer periods and streamlining asylum claims.
“We have an unserious Congress that is not coming to the table,” she said.
“The Republicans failed to do their job when they were in charge, no doubt. And the Democrats now are failing to come together in the House.”
Congress has raised concerns in recent days about the president’s reshuffling of the Department of Homeland Security leadership, which has led to the resignations of several key officials who deal with immigration issues.
Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen resigned last week under pressure from Trump after disagreements with the White House over border policy, as did the acting deputy Homeland Secretary Claire Grady, who had been next in the agency’s line of succession. That paved the way for Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan, Trump’s preferred acting DHS head, to assume temporary control of the agency.
Full Kellyanne: 'We have an unserious Congress' on finding immigration solutions April 14, 2019 14:50 The president has increasingly focused his attention on the situation at the border and has also blamed Democrats on Twitter for a failure to stop the flow of illegal border crossings.
This week, he declared he’s “giving strong consideration” to sending undocumented immigrants in federal detention to so-called sanctuary cities, framing the plan as a way to force Democrats to make good on their pro-immigration rhetoric.
""They say we have open arms, they're always saying they have open arms, let's see if they have open arms,” Trump said.
Conway said it was a cooperative proposal, not a threat.
“It wasn’t a brow-beat, it was taken that way,” she said, adding that mayors can reach out to the White House if they want to help by temporarily taking in undocumented immigrants.
Gov. Jay Inslee, D-Wash., who is running for president, responded to the idea in a separate appearance on “Meet the Press,” calling it a threat that won’t work because cities will open their arms to undocumented immigrants.
“This is yet another act of bombastic chaos that’s simply not going to work for this ineffective president,” he said.
“You can’t threaten somebody with something they aren’t afraid of and we are not afraid of diversity in the state of Washington.”

Seychelles President Danny Faure waves as he emerges from the ocean inside a submersible off the coast of the Seychelles on April 14, 2019. Steve Barker / AP Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. SUBSCRIBE April 14, 2019, 1:52 PM GMT By The Associated Press DESROCHES ISLAND, Seychelles — In a striking speech delivered from deep below the ocean's surface, the Seychelles president on Sunday made a global plea for stronger protection of the ""beating blue heart of our planet."" President Danny Faure's call for action, the first-ever live speech from an underwater submersible, came from one of the many island nations threatened by global warming. He spoke during a visit to an ambitious British-led science expedition exploring the Indian Ocean depths. Oceans cover over two-thirds of the world's surface but remain, for the most part, uncharted. We have better maps of Mars than we do of the ocean floor, Faure said. ""This issue is bigger than all of us, and we cannot wait for the next generation to solve it. We are running out of excuses to not take action, and running out of time,"" the president said from a manned submersible 400 feet below the waves, on the seabed off the outer islands of the African nation. Seychelles President Danny Faure, left, speaks from insider a submersible of the vessel Ocean Zephyr underwater off the coast of Desroches on April 14, 2019. Nekton via AP Wearing a Seychelles T-shirt and shorts, the president told The Associated Press after his speech that the experience was ""so, so cool. What biodiversity."" It made him more determined than ever to speak out for marine protection, he said. ""We just need to do what needs to be done. The scientists have spoken."" The oceans' role in regulating climate and the threats they face are underestimated by many, even though as Faure pointed out they generate ""half of the oxygen we breathe."" Scientific missions are crucial in taking stock of underwater ecosystems' health. Small island nations are among the most vulnerable to sea level rise caused by climate change, and some have found creative ways to express their concerns. Faure's speech came a decade after members of the Maldives' Cabinet donned scuba gear and used hand signals at an underwater meeting highlighting global warming's threat to the lowest-lying nation on earth. Land erosion, dying coral reefs and the increased frequency of extreme weather events threaten such countries' existence. During the expedition, marine scientists from the University of Oxford have surveyed underwater life, mapped large areas of the sea floor and gone deep with manned submersibles and underwater drones. Little is known about the watery world below depths of 30 meters, the limit to which a normal scuba diver can go. Operating down to 500 meters, the scientists were the first to explore areas of great diversity where sunlight weakens and the deep ocean begins. By the end of the mission, researchers expect to have conducted over 300 deployments, collected around 1,400 samples and 16 terabytes of data and surveyed about 30 square kilometers of seabed using high-resolution multi-beam sonar equipment. Related Tidal energy pioneers see vast potential in ocean currents' ebb and flow The data will be used to help the Seychelles expand its policy of protecting almost a third of its national waters by 2020. The initiative is important for the country's ""blue economy,"" an attempt to balance development needs with those of the environment. ""From this depth, I can see the incredible wildlife that needs our protection, and the consequences of damaging this huge ecosystem that has existed for millennia,"" Faure said in his speech. ""Over the years, we have created these problems. We can solve them."" Currently, only about 5 percent of the world's oceans are protected. Countries have agreed to increase the area to 10 percent by 2020. But experts and environmental campaigners say between 30 percent and 50 percent of the oceans outside nations' territorial waters should get protected status to ensure marine biodiversity. Researchers hope their findings also will inform ongoing United Nations talks aimed at forging the first high seas conservation treaty, scheduled to conclude this year. Environmental groups argue an international treaty is urgently needed because climate change, overfishing and efforts to mine the seabed for precious minerals are putting unsustainable pressure on marine life that could have devastating consequences for creatures on land as well. Related Global warming will cause the world's oceans to change color. Here's why. Oceans will be one of the seven main themes of this year's U.N. climate summit in Chile in December. While scientists with the Nekton mission are nearing the end of their expedition, much of their work is just beginning. In the next few months, researchers at Oxford will analyze the samples and video surveys and put them together with environmental data. ""When we pull them together we can understand not just what we see in the areas that we've visited but what we might expect in other regions in the Seychelles,"" said Lucy Woodall, the mission's chief scientist. This is the first of a half-dozen regions the mission plans to explore before the end of 2022, when scientists will present their research at a summit on the state of the Indian Ocean. Billions of people live along the ocean's shores in Africa and Asia."
"Democrats aren't 'smart enough' to read Trump's tax returns, Sanders says",www.nbcnews.com,,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/democrats-aren-t-smart-enough-read-trump-s-tax-returns-n994291,"The White House is offering another rationale for why Democrats should not get their hands on President Donald Trump's tax filings: They're not ""smart enough"" to properly understand them. Speaking with "" Fox News Sunday "" host Chris Wallace, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said she wouldn't ""trust"" members of Congress to fully grasp the contents of the president's returns.
""And frankly, Chris, I don't think Congress, particularly this group of congressmen and women, are smart enough to look through the thousands of pages that I would assume President Trump's taxes will be,"" Sanders said. ""My guess is most of them don't do their own taxes, and I certainly don't trust them to look through the decades of success the president's had and determine anything.""
Sanders said Trump has ""been clear since the beginning that as long as his taxes are under audit he's not going to release them"" and has ""also filled out hundreds of pages in financial disclosure.""
Asked if Trump will order the IRS not to release his filings, Sanders said, ""We'll have to see what happens on that front.""
Sanders' remarks come after congressional Democrats gave the IRS an April 23 deadline to turn over the president's returns to the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. Earlier this month, the committee's chairman, Richard Neal, D-Mass., formally requested six years of Trump's personal and business tax filings from the IRS under a statute that allows him to demand an individual's returns. That statute allows the chairman to request the returns for a policy-related purpose, and Democrats have insisted they need to see the taxes to determine how Trump's financial interests might be influencing his policymaking decisions.
The Treasury Department initially rebuffed an April 10 deadline Neal set. Should the IRS not turn over the returns, it could spark a legal battle to obtain them.
""To date, the IRS has failed to provide the requested return and return information despite an unambiguous legal obligation to do so. ... Please know that, if you fail to comply, your failure will be interpreted as a denial of my request,"" Neal wrote in a letter to IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig, adding there was ""no valid basis to question the legitimacy of the Committee’s legislative purpose.""
Speaking about the latest request, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said Saturday that as he has ""emphasized in the past, I think the request raises some very complex issues.""
""And I do intend to follow the law, but I think these raise very, very complicated legal issues,"" he said. ""I don’t think these are simple issues.""
Trump spoke about the request Wednesday, telling reporters he's not going to make his taxes public because they're under audit.
""No, there is no law,"" he said. ""As you know, I got elected last time with this same issue. And while I’m under audit, I won’t do it. If I’m not under audit, I would do it. I had no problem with it. But while I’m under audit, I would not give my taxes. There’s no law whatsoever.
Trump has been saying he is under audit since the 2016 election cycle, using that explanation to refuse to release his returns. Although the IRS has regularly audited presidents and vice presidents since the 1970s, being under audit does not preclude Trump from making the information public. Trump is the only major presidential candidate of either party since the early 1970s not to release his tax returns.
Last Sunday , acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said Democrats will ""never"" be able to obtain Trump's taxes.
Sanders on Sunday said the Democrats' request ""has nothing to do with whether they're going to determine policy"" and said Democrats were going down a ""dangerous, dangerous road,"" calling the move ""disgusting overreach.""

Poll: Black and white defines red and blue,www.nbcnews.com,Dante Chinni,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/meet-the-press/poll-black-white-defines-red-blue-n994251,"WASHINGTON - Members of minority groups and whites in the United States often see the world through very different lenses, but politically speaking those differences are magnified by the blue/red divide, according to a new Pew Research survey. And that partisan split may be even more important in Washington. The Pew survey looked at attitudes around issues of racial equality in America and found some very different views among white, black, Hispanic and Asian Americans.
The Pew survey looked at attitudes around issues of racial equality in America and found some very different views among white, black, Hispanic and Asian Americans. For instance, 78 percent of African Americans said the country had not gone far enough on the issue of making sure blacks had equal rights with whites. But only 37 percent of white respondents thought that was true. Among Hispanics, 48 percent thought the country had not gone far enough.
On the legacy of slavery, 84 percent of blacks said slavery had “a great deal” or a “fair amount” of impact on the position of African Americans in society today. A lower number of whites, 58 percent agreed. And among Hispanics and Asians, the numbers were 67 percent and 69 percent respectively.
And 84 percent of black respondents said people not seeing racial discrimination where it exists is a bigger problem than people seeing racism where it doesn’t exist. Whites were the only group where a majority, 52 percent, said the opposite was true – that the bigger problem is people seeing racism where it really does not exist.
Those racial splits are pretty stark, but the picture changes dramatically when you look at the same questions with white respondents broken into groups of self-identified Democrats and Republicans.
The picture changes dramatically when you look at the same questions with white respondents broken into groups of self-identified Democrats and Republicans. Among white Democrats, 64 percent of respondents say the country hasn't gone far enough in giving black people equal rights. But among white Republicans, only 15 percent say they hold that view.
On the legacy of slavery, 80 percent of white Democrats say it's had a big impact, compared to 40 percent of white Republicans.
And 78 percent of white Democrats say people not seeing discrimination is a bigger problem than people seeing racism where it really doesn’t exist. With white Republicans, that figure is 22 percent.
In other words, on these issues, white Democrats look a lot more like African-American respondents than they look like white Republicans. And the same kinds of differences appear when you look at how people view racial equality in real-life circumstances.
On the surface, the question of how African Americans are treated on a range of important everyday situations divides pretty clearly along racial lines.
In other words, on these issues white Democrats look a lot more like African-American respondents than they look like white Republicans. A majority of blacks surveyed said they believe they are treated less fairly than whites in dealing with police, in the workplace, when voting in elections and when applying for mortgages or loans.
Overall, white respondents did not agree. A majority of whites, 63 percent, agreed that blacks are not treated equally when dealing with police. But a majority of white respondents did not agree that blacks are treated unfairly in the workplace, when voting and when applying for mortgages or loans.
Again, however, those numbers for whites shift, when a partisan blue/red filter is placed over them.
The numbers for whites shift, when a partisan blue/red filter is placed over them. With large majorities, white Democrats say blacks are not treated fairly in dealing with police (88 percent), in the workplace (72 percent), when voting in elections (60 percent), and when applying for a mortgage or loan (64 percent).
White Republicans, meanwhile, feel very differently about whether blacks are treated unfairly on all those fronts: dealing with police (43 percent), in the workplace (21 percent), when voting in elections (7 percent) and when applying for a mortgage or loan (17 percent).
In every one of those cases, the numbers for white Democrats are more than twice as high as those for white Republicans, in some cases much more.
And those questions are particularly important in Washington because they deal with real-life situations that go directly to policy prescriptives.
How much racism a person sees in the world may be about one’s point-of-view or experience, but when the issues are differences how people are treated by police or whether someone gets a home, those are fundamental questions about equal protection under the law.
And in that way, the Pew survey reveals why issues around racial equality are so complicated in DC. Changing policies are bound to be difficult when the two parties see the roots of those issues and their modern-day realities so differently.
But the partisan split among whites also reveals a lot about the larger state of U.S. politics in 2019. The historical gap between the way whites and blacks view the country is still wide. But the data here suggest the blue/red divide may be even more profound.

SUBSCRIBE April 14, 2019, 3:16 PM GMT By Yuliya Talmazan It was a one-man show for Ukraine’s President Petro Poroshenko on Sunday as he held a lonely debate at the country's largest sports stadium ahead of next week’s presidential runoff. Comedian Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who won the first round of the election on March 31 , didn't make an appearance at Kiev’s 70,000-seat Olimpiyskiy Stadium. Zelenskiy, who's never held office, had challenged the incumbent Poroshenko to a debate in the stadium on Friday, April 19 — two days before voters head to the polls. Poroshenko wanted it to be held Sunday, but Zelenskiy never agreed to the Sunday debate. The spectacle was the latest twist in a bizarre campaign that has seen both candidates submit to drug and alcohol tests. With Zelenskiy absent Sunday, Poroshenko stood in front of an empty lectern with the comedian’s name written on it and spent nearly an hour talking about his platform and answering questions from the media. There were no spectators inside the stadium, but a crowd of what appeared to be thousands of people listened outside, cheering and waving Ukrainian flags. Some in the crowd chanted: “Vova (diminutive of Volodymyr), come out!,” urging Zelenskiy to make a last-minute appearance. Former comedian leads polls of Ukrainian presidential elections March 31, 2019 01:30 On Sunday, Poroshenko quipped that he was not holding a “press conference” and was “simply waiting for Zelenskiy [to show up].” He lashed out at the comedian, comparing his campaign to a “silent movie"" and saying that Ukraine does not need a “virtual” president — a reference to Zelenskiy's frequent use of social media to talk to his voters. “When a candidate just appears on the screen and says nothing, it’s just a scene from Servant of the People,” Poroshenko said, referring to a TV show in which Zelenskiy plays a history teacher turned president. Related A brain drain is devastating Ukraine The debates have become a focal point ahead of the runoff. Zelenskiy, who won nearly twice as many votes as Poroshenko in the first round, has been accused of being deliberately vague about where he stands on issues like foreign policy and the economy. A poll conducted days before the first round of the election revealed that 74 percent of Ukrainians want to see a debate take place before the runoff. No campaigning is allowed the day before the voters head to the polls on April 21, making April 19 the last chance for the two candidates to appeal to voters. In an interview with Ukrainian channel ICTV Monday, Poroshenko said : ""I believe that the debate is a key element of democracy.” Poroshenko himself did not turn up for a debate in 2014. People pass by a billboard depicting Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko and Russian President Vladimir Putin looking at each other in Kiev. Writing on the board reads: ""A decisive choice."" Efrem Lukatsky / AP In what became the only direct interaction between the two candidates on Thursday, Poroshenko showed up uninvited to a political show on a channel that belongs to Ihor Kolomoisky, an oligarch accused of being the real power behind Zelenskiy's campaign. Zelenskiy called in during the show and said he was not able to be physically present because he was in Paris for a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron. The two spoke in heightened tones, continuously interrupting each other, while talking about the date for a debate as astounded hosts and audience members looked on. Zelenskiy eventually ended the call abruptly, leading some to question his conduct. Related"

Watch Trump's mentions of WikiLeaks in days leading up to election Aug. 18, 2017 01:44 The Department of Justice indicted Assange on a charge of conspiring with former Army intelligence officer Chelsea Manning to hack a classified government computer. Manning provided WikiLeaks with a trove of secret government documents that the website published in 2010. Assange has insisted the U.S. is trying to infringe on journalistic freedom. Assange and WIkiLeaks were at the forefront of leaking stolen emails during the 2016 presidential campaign, including from 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman John Podesta. At the time, Trump routinely name-dropped WikiLeaks, praising the organization. “I love WikiLeaks,” Trump said in October 2016. But on Thursday, when asked about Assange's organization, Trump told reporters at the White House : I know nothing about WikiLeaks."" ""It's not my thing,"" he added. On Sunday, Sanders said the Trump administration was ""the only one to do anything about"" Assange and WikiLeaks. ""Let's not forget that the reason Julian Assange is being looked at is because of the engagement he had with Chelsea Manning,"" she said before adding that Trump ""was making a joke during the campaign"" when he expressed love for the organization.

'Game of Thrones' finale means a welcome end to the endless Westeros hype,www.nbcnews.com,Noah Berlatsky,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/game-thrones-finale-means-welcome-end-endless-westeros-hype-ncna994256,"“Game of Thrones” is finally ending . And with it will end the weekly , yearly and really daily opportunities to write think pieces about “Game of Thrones.” At least since the end of ""Mad Men"" in 2015, “Game of Thrones” has been the undisputed king of TV criticism, from recaps to hot takes to long form, from rape to racism to realism. It is the show that has seemingly united all serious TV watchers in a collective ritual of brow-furrowing. No wonder that some critics are writing about this as the end of an era — maybe, the best-ever era . Alison Herman, anticipating the conclusion two years ago , mused that ""it feels inadequate to discuss ‘Thrones’ as a simple TV show,"" and insisted it was the ""last vestige of the monoculture."" Matt Zoller Seitz at Vulture mourned : ""What current scripted series besides ‘Game of Thrones’ has the power to move and enthrall viewers so viscerally, and in such great numbers, all at once?"" Seitz argues that with the new Netflix model, where entire seasons are released at once, ""we"" no longer have a collective experience of event television. “Game of Thrones” united us, perhaps for the last time.
It's worth asking, though, who this ""we"" really is. Were all of us really fascinated with “Game of Thrones""? I can say for sure that I wasn't. I saw the pilot, was bored and irritated, and never watched again.
Were all of us really fascinated with “Game of Thrones?” I can say for sure that I wasn't.
Maybe that's a failure on my part. But just because our cultural gatekeepers write think pieces about the same show doesn’t mean that's the show everyone is, or should be, thinking about. Who and what is erased when critics obsess about the Iron Throne?
One thing that's erased is the fact that the massive critical buzz about ""Thrones"" was never quite matched by its ratings. The series smashed records for HBO ; its season seven finale in 2017 was seen by more than 12 million viewers. But that looks pretty anemic compared to 2018's No. 1-rated show , “Roseanne,” with 20 million average viewers. The second and third most-watched TV shows of 2018 — “Sunday Night Football” and “Big Bang Theory,” respectively — both averaged close to 18 million viewers in 2018, according to Nielsen. “Bull,” which was No. 10 last year, did better on average then “Game of Thrones” did in its mega-hyped season seven finale — around 13.5 million viewers.
“Game of Thrones,” then, isn't really a universal viewing experience. Compared to “Big Bang Theory,” it looks more almost a niche interest. But that niche is one which happens to be composed of people who want to read think pieces (and write them). It generates a great deal of online conversation. But if you want to talk about the cultural zeitgeist as a whole, the American public is, for better or worse, a lot more focused on innocuous sitcoms filled with sexual innuendo than they are on confrontational fantasy filled with sexual violence and incest.
Related Pop Culture Five minutes with Ned Stark: His 'Game of Thrones' predictions and whether he'll return Critical disinterest in the most popular TV shows is understandable to some extent. I wouldn't want to write weekly think pieces on “Young Sheldon” (close to 16 million average viewers) either. But the disconnect is unfortunate for a couple of reasons.
First, very popular television shows can tell you about the culture they're a part of. “Big Bang Theory,” for example, vacillates between loathing and fetishizing nerd culture. It has something quite relevant to say about an America in which certain men associated with gaming, or comics, or rationalist subcultures simultaneously see themselves as despised and entitled to attention and power.
Second, critics can't do much to hold very popular shows accountable if they never discuss them. Thousands of words have been posted about the way “Game of Thrones” handles sexual violence . But many more viewers are exposed to these issues through Dick Wolf's proliferating “Law & Order” franchise, or the shamelessly pro-police “Blue Bloods” on CBS . Television writers often push for more diverse casting. But that advocacy is going to have limited effect when the most-viewed shows (which are, in fact, largely headed by white actors ) are hardly ever discussed.
Critics are supposed to help people find worthwhile art. But there's not much room for boosting neglected gems when everyone is recapping that one show again.
And it's not just the most popular shows that are undermined by critics' singular obsessions. There are a lot of smart, funny, gripping, thoughtful shows that are mostly ignored. Critics are supposed to help people find worthwhile art, which in turn helps that art flourish. But there's not much room for boosting neglected gems when everyone is recapping that one show again.
""Counterpart,” for example, a brilliant spy show about alternate worlds with a dazzling performance by J.K. Simmons, just got canceled. It's a series about terrorism, imperialism, prejudice and borders . It virtually demanded a critical response, which was never forthcoming. Other shows, like “Santa Clarita Diet” on Netflix are in the odd position of being both widely praised and widely ignored . Critics recommend them … and that's about all they have to say. (Which is a shame, because “Santa Clarita Diet” is a very smart show .)
Related Opinion Netflix zombie drama 'Santa Clarita Diet' shreds gender stereotypes — and humans It's not really a surprise that certain shows generate exponentially more criticism and discussion than others. Part of why fans like art is because it's a way to connect to other people. Economists have found that listeners prefer to download songs that lots of other people have downloaded . Humans like to herd. People who like to talk about television have decided to talk about “Game of Thrones,"" so they can all be sure they're talking about the same thing.
There's nothing wrong with that. Here I am talking about “Game of Thrones” too, after all. Communal experiences can be exhilarating and unifying. But they can also exclude and distort. Maybe, though, we can use the end of “Game of Thrones” to ask what all those think pieces failed to think about when they were thinking so uniformly about the one thing. Our cultural conversation will be richer if, after our long sojourn in Westeros, we can take this opportunity to travel to some other places.

I’m a huge nerd, so that’s always going to be apart of me.”
Guilbeaux was kicked out of her home at 16 by her adoptive family when they discovered she was a lesbian. Later, she tried going to the University of Kansas to study computer science, but she had to drop out after accruing too much student loan debt.
Her story became the center of “Black Girl Magic,” an episode on the most recent season of the Emmy-winning Netflix reality makeover show. In the days following, fans started a GoFundMe page to raise money for the 23-year-old waitress. In less than a month, they raised $100,000, reaching the fundraising goal.
“I was just super grateful for people wanting to help me with a dream that I had basically buried,” she said. “It’s such a kind gesture, and it was totally unexpected.”

When asked what she hopes people take away from her story, Guilbeaux noted that “everyone goes through something” challenging in their life, and she hopes her story helps them feel empowered to get through those times.
“Don’t let your struggle define you, because you are more than that,” she said. “You can do anything you set your mind to if you just believe in yourself.”

Why we have food cravings and what to do about them,www.nbcnews.com,"Samantha Cassetty, RD",04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/better/lifestyle/why-we-have-food-cravings-what-do-about-them-ncna985606,"What do all of these things have in common: French fries , cupcakes, cookies, pasta, pizza and bread ? They all fall in the category of foods we crave. A craving is defined as a powerful desire and when it comes to food, almost everyone has had a first-hand experience. Let’s unpack the science of cravings. Physical or psychological? Despite a popular theory suggesting that cravings are related to nutrient deficiencies, there’s scant scientific support for this notion. That may explain why you’re unlikely to hear chatter about craving chickpeas, despite the fact that this food will supply fiber, magnesium, potassium, iron and folate — nutrients that are often shortchanged in an American diet . Still, cravings are partly driven by nature and partly by nurture.
Here’s where the physical part comes in: Processed foods are craved more often than natural, whole foods because they’re more reinforcing. Research shows that high fat, high carbohydrate foods (think: ice cream, French fries, pizza, cookies, mac and cheese, cakes) light up reward circuitry in our brain more than foods that are either high in fat or high in carbs (as nature might supply them) — and more than you’d expect given people’s stated liking for those foods. Other research suggests that sugar acts on similar pathways in the brain as addictive substances, which would explain some of our cravings, binging behaviors, and use of food as a reward.
Other biological factors come into play, too. Studies suggest that insufficient sleep can drive up cravings for less healthy fare. Sleep deprivation can make food seem more enticing , and it can lower our inhibitions, putting us less in control of our eating choices.
Eating plays a central role in just about every major life event, social activity and religious ceremony so food is very intertwined with emotions and culture.
Often, though, a craving is a learned response. Say when you were growing up, Friday night was pizza night, and everyone was relaxed and in a good mood (because mom and dad can sleep in on Saturdays, no one had to cook dinner , and dishes are pretty effortless when pizza is involved). Deep down inside, you might couple these experiences in a number of ways. Maybe Fridays roll around and you have a hankering for pizza because you’ve paired pizza with Friday. Or maybe you want to relax and chill and that triggers a craving for pizza because you’ve coupled chill time with pizza. Or maybe you watch a movie about a family and the craving strikes because you’ve unconsciously coupled pizza with a family setting. You may not be aware that you formed these associations, but once they’re linked, a similar association (fun, relaxation, family, Friday) can cue the craving regardless of how hungry you are.
Just think: Eating plays a central role in just about every major life event, social activity and religious ceremony so food is very intertwined with emotions and culture. We start to associate good feelings with the food that takes center stage in these moments.
But we also form habits around food and unpleasant feelings. Breakup ? Fight with a friend? Bad day at work? We want these feelings to go away ASAP! Since food can light up pleasure centers in our brain, we might make ourselves feel good with rewarding foods and then another association is formed (bad feeling + rewarding food = momentary good feeling).
Related A better way A better way Why we crave comfort foods — and how to make them healthier Uncoupling cravings Just like Gwyneth Paltrow’s and Chris Martin’s famous conscious uncoupling, you can consciously uncouple cravings. Warning: It isn’t easy. “If you de-pair the associations, the cravings dissipate,” says Martin Binks , PhD, associate professor and Director of the Nutrition Metabolic Health Initiative (HMI) at Texas Tech department of Nutritional Sciences. He points to research among people who replace meals with shakes — in essence, eliminating food cues (sights, smells, taste) while reducing calories. Though you might expect cravings to go through the roof (because, let’s face it, this is the mother of restrictive dieting!), the research shows people in these conditions report fewer cravings, not more.
Binks was involved in research that took this one step further, looking at the brain scans of a small group of obese individuals who were shown images of food. Both groups reduced their calorie intake , but one group was doing so with meal replacement shakes and the other group was limiting their food intake. After showing them the equivalent of a food blogger’s Instagram feed, the brain scans revealed that while the shake drinkers experienced activity in their brains that deemed food rewarding, it also showed higher activity in the area of the brain that controls decision-making. Binks explains that if you take all of the mental work out of eating — no prep, no more thinking about what’s for dinner (because, it’s a shake for you!) — even if you’re staring pizza in the face and your brain tells you it wants in, it can also do the hard work of overriding that signal. The eaters’ scans did not show the same decision-making activation.
Basically, he says if you were to stop eating the craved food and remove yourself from any reminders of it, the craving would diminish. However, once a reminder pops up, the cravings return and you’re back to square one.
Mark Bittman thinks you're bad at eating July 5, 2018 02:00 How to manage cravings In real life, we eat, we go to parties (hello, dessert table), we scroll social media feeds , click through recipes online, watch TV (and therefore, view food during programming and on commercial breaks); we can’t escape food cues. Now what?
Experts caution against severely restricting your favorite foods since it can ultimately take a toll on your emotional health. If you deem M&Ms totally off-limits, the decision-making part of your brain has to work really hard every time you pass a vending machine, go through a checkout (whether at a grocery store , convenience store or drugstore), attend a party or work event, etc. All of the sudden, it seems like M&Ms are everywhere and you have to make a conscious decision to avoid them each and every time. This type of mental workout is draining, causing some people to throw in the towel and overeat, which may lead to feelings of guilt and shame.
Instead of giving your willpower that kind of demanding workout, one well-studied approach to handling cravings is to develop a mindfulness practice . At the root, mindfulness is the practice of being present in the moment, and studies suggest it can help reduce emotional eating, manage cravings and put us in better control of our impulses around food. It can also increase our enjoyment of food. If you’re struggling with food cravings, here are some tips you can try today.
1. Develop more awareness You can practice being mindful anywhere — when you’re hanging out with your family, put your phone down and engage in the moment more. When you’re participating in yoga , don’t let your mind wander and let go of any agenda you have to hold a pose for a certain amount of time or be as flexible as the person in a pretzel next to you. When you’re eating, put your fork down between bites, and ask yourself what your food tastes like. Notice if it’s crunchy, sweet, mushy. Chew thoroughly, and spend a moment taking in the sensations and experiencing the flavor. You can strengthen your mindfulness practice through breathing exercises and guided meditation.
2. Listen to your body We talked about all the reasons we eat (joy, stress, social cues, etc.), but plugging in to your body’s signals can help you recognize what’s happening in the moment. Do you have physical signs of hunger , such as a growling stomach or an empty feeling in your belly? Are you bored? Uncomfortable? When you’re attentive, you can uncover some of the feelings that are present and notice when you’re eating because you’re physically hungry and when something else may be overriding your body’s own hunger and fullness signals.

Get comfortable with feeling uncomfortable Sometimes we eat to blunt uncomfortable feelings. Remember, we want bad feelings to disappear and a quick and easy way to usher in some good feelings is to eat highly rewarding foods. But forcing our feelings off to the side doesn’t really address them. Studies suggest that a mindfulness meditation practice can help you observe these emotions without reacting to them, which can put you in a better frame of mind to cope with your emotions. This awareness will also help you reduce the urge to distract yourself with food.
4. Develop more helpful habits and rewards Now that you’re developing your awareness about when you’re eating for hunger or for other reasons, you can decide what’s right for you in that moment. Maybe it’s a cup of tea or a cuddle with a pet, or maybe it’s a cupcake at times. It’s unrealistic to think that you’ll never eat for reasons other than hunger and there may be times when you want to eat simply for pure pleasure or to soothe your soul. But often, another habit may be more healthful and helpful in the long run. When you’re more mindful, you can also be more intentional instead of just obeying the call of the craving, and that can help you respond better to both emotional and physical signals.
5. Make a memory around your eating experience The practice of being present allows you to enjoy food more fully because you’re immersed in the entire experience — how food tastes, what’s going on around you, who you’re enjoying it with. When I’m working with clients, I remind them that when food experiences are more memorable — meaning you’re taking the time to savor a meal or a treat rather than eating on the fly, in the car, or staring at your email — they’re also more physically and emotionally satisfying. When you enjoy foods that make you swoon under memorable circumstances, you may find it’s not necessary to indulge as often.

Everything Americans think they know about recycling is probably wrong,www.nbcnews.com,Erin Biba,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/everything-americans-think-they-know-about-recycling-probably-wrong-ncna994261,"Everything you think you know about recycling is probably wrong. Since the slogan “reduce, reuse and recycle” became part of the cultural lexicon in the 1970s during the birth of Earth Day when Congress passed the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act , the concept of recycling has become the go-to refrain for the average citizen casually — but not acutely — concerned about the environment. The problem is, if you ask people to explain what happens to their waste after they throw it in the bin, almost no American is able to answer. And that’s because our perception of recycling in the U.S. and the realities of actual recycling do not match up. The concept of recycling has become the go-to refrain for the average citizen casually — but not acutely — concerned about the environment.
The truth is, there’s no universal form of recycling across the country. Every city and state has its own regulations and methods that govern how and what it recycles. In some places, recycling is mostly effective and efficient. In other places, some or all of what is thrown into a recycling bin ends up in in landfills or garbage incinerators. And even though the EPA estimates that about 75 percent of waste produced in the U.S. is capable of being recycled, the U.S. recycling rate has plateaued at about 34 percent — and that hasn’t changed since 2010 . The sad fact is that, even though most of us believe in the theoretical benefits of recycling, we may not be participating efficiently — or at all.
SIGN UP FOR THE THINK WEEKLY NEWSLETTER HERE
Before we get into the problems with recycling in the U.S. it’s important to point out that, though we could be doing a much better job, even a little bit of inefficient recycling is better than no recycling at all. According to the EPA , Americans are still returning about 68 million tons of raw materials back into the manufacturing market every year. And that means, in the case of paper for example, fewer trees cut down, less carbon burned hauling logs to mills, less energy and water used to pulp those trees and an overall net gain for the environment. Recycling is good. Recycling works. And we need to keep recycling.
Why recycling may be going to waste in the US Sept. 2, 2018 03:24 But raw material is the key word here when looking at the benefit of even the most efficient recycling system. Recycling isn’t a nebulous humanitarian environmental practice of collecting waste. It is, actually, a business. It’s a commodities market that we all participate in. It produces paper pulp and plastic pellets and glass shards and other materials that are used by manufacturers to make goods. So even in the best recycling systems the goods you send to the recycler to be processed are only going to become new products if there’s a market demand for them. (For example, is there a bottling factory in your community that needs glass or a paper mill nearby that needs pulp?)
And not all recycling plants are actually capable of processing all materials. (For example, foam containers and thin film plastic, like plastic bags or saran wrap, are actually very difficult or impossible to recycle and end up in landfills even if you put them in the recycling bin.) Just like any market the need for commodities is variable. Sometimes there’s no one around that currently needs glass, for example, and so recyclers will either store those products for later sale or just send them off to the landfill or incinerator.
This means you think you’ve recycled 100 percent of the recyclable goods you buy when, in fact, you probably haven’t.
This means you think you’ve recycled 100 percent of the recyclable goods you buy when, in fact, you probably haven’t. “Like wheat and oil and gold, recycled commodities like aluminum, paper, metals, and plastics have value and those fluctuate,” says Eric Goldstein, a senior attorney at the National Resources Defense Council. “To run a recycling program you don’t want to keep changing the rules all the time.”
And that means you end up having consumers knowingly and unknowingly participating in what Ruth Abbe, president of Zero Waste USA, calls wishcycling. “We wish it was recyclable, so we recycle it anyway,” even if it’s just going to end up in a landfill, she says.
But these are problems that exist in all systems, including the most efficient ones. And it’s true that in some places in the U.S. our processes are working well — big cities like San Francisco on the West Coast claim to be recycling about 70 percent or more of their waste (though this is hard to measure and these numbers should be taken with a grain of salt). In regions like Boulder, Colorado and Saint Paul, Minnesota for example, recycling companies are independent non-profits who operate with the mission of recycling as much as they can. But in other parts of the country, especially in East Coast cities like Washington D.C. , the recycling system is run by large waste hauling monopolies where the focus isn’t on recycling, it’s on profit.
“The reason why recycling costs so much is because the big waste management companies realized recycling was taking away from their profits. Recycling is their enemy,” says Neil Seldman, director of the Waste to Wealth Initiative at the Institute for Local Self Reliance. “That’s the achilles heel of big waste.”
According to Seldman, these companies are doing the majority of the country’s recycling while also operating the majority of our landfill business. And because they’re more focused on the less expensive process of filling their landfills, they’ve convinced the cities they work with to move away from recycling systems that process smaller, more manageable amounts of recyclables on several lines (meaning the waste is better sorted) to processing huge amounts on single lines, which is less expensive, less complicated and allows them to process a larger volume — but creates more contaminated less-desirable end materials.
And while places like Minneapolis and Saint Paul are sending 90 percent of their high quality processed raw materials to manufacturers inside the state, these big companies in places like Washington DC are carting waste to facilities far outside the cities they collect from and then mostly shipping their low quality contaminated processed materials out of the country to China.
Related Opinion Opinion Can vegetarians save the planet? Why campaigns to ban meat send the wrong message on climate change “In the 1990s, about five percent of U.S. cities used single stream recycling. By 2010, 75 percent of cities were using it. Recycling is stagnating in the US not because people don’t want to recycle, it’s because the structure is the least efficient form of recycling,” says Seldman.
To compound this problem, China has recently passed laws that will ban most recycling from outside the country — specifically plastic. Says Seldman: “The materials were so contaminated the cost of labor went up so much China couldn’t afford to clean our materials. That’s not the fault of recycling, it’s the fault of cities going to single stream. It's been a disaster.” And that means cities around the U.S. are now either going to have to give up recycling altogether ( which some, like Deltona, Florida , have indicated they will do) or convert their recycling processes over to more efficient systems, which Seldman says is the more likely future.
According to the NRDC’s Goldstein, there are a few ways that the U.S. can recover from the loss of China: “One thing that is needed is greater investment by private industry in, as well as government incentives for, new processing capacity for recyclables. (Some of that is happened, 16 paper mills have recently announced plans to expand to handle mixed paper and cardboard generated by US recycling programs.) And there is the failure of the federal government, as well as most states and cities, to step up their procurement of products made with recycled materials. That too would stimulate demand and therefore enhance the economics of municipal recycling operations.”
So where does that leave the American public? For starters, it means we have to stop thinking that recycling is “enough” when it comes to the planet.
But even if all our cities are pushed by China to become more efficient and more innovative — and even if our recycling rates start to climb again — we’ll still always have the issue of market variability.
So where does that leave the American public? For starters, it means we have to stop thinking that recycling is “enough” when it comes to the planet. In truth, recycling is arguably less important than re-using and reducing. Yes, without question recycling is an essential aspect of a healthy planet and clean environment. But it should also be our last resort.
“The big takeaway from the era that we’re in is that we really should be more mindful about what we’re purchasing. We shouldn’t depend on the fact that we can recycle it. First you have to reduce,” says Zero Waste’s Abbe.
Reducing our consumption of items that we will have to throw in the trash or the recycling bin — or completely replacing those items with products that we can reuse and not throw away at all — is a good way to offset the fact that recycling isn’t a magic bullet solution for the planet. The fewer items you have drop in the recycling bin, the less you have to worry about whether or not those items will be recycled efficiently or whether or not the commodities market is currently demanding them.
“The whole story is about consumption and how much Americans consume and how much we aspire to consume. This is the cornerstone of sustainability,” says the NRDC’s Goldstein. “If everybody in the world used as much energy and consumed as much materials as the average American does we wouldn’t be passing on to our children and grandchildren a sustainable world.”
In the end, even if a bottle or a can or a piece of paper is recycled, that doesn’t mean its impact is erased. It took valuable resources to create that object in the first place. So if recycling a piece of paper saves a tree, just imagine how many resources could have be saved if we never even needed to make that piece of paper to begin with.

2020 Dems stand by Omar as she's hammered for 9/11 comments,www.nbcnews.com,Allan Smith,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/2020-dems-stand-omar-she-s-hammered-9-11-comments-n994286,"Several 2020 Democratic presidential candidates have come to the defense of Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., as she was blasted for comments about the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and Muslim civil rights at a recent conference. While speaking last month at an event hosted by the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) in Los Angeles, Omar discussed how Muslim Americans had their constitutional rights and freedoms infringed upon following the 9/11 attacks, making a comment that some saw as minimizing the terrorist act.
""CAIR was founded after 9/11 because they recognized that some people did something and that all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties,” she said, incorrectly stating the organization's history. The group was actually founded in 1994, although it became much more active following the terror attacks.
Most prominent among her critics was President Donald Trump, who tweeted a video of the Twin Towers being hit by airplanes and burning down interspersed with a cut of Omar saying ""some people"" did ""something"" when speaking about the terror attacks. His video echoed criticism of Omar on the front page of Thursday's New York Post , which included the headline ""Here's Your Something"" over an image of the Twin Towers burning.

— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 12, 2019 Democratic presidential contenders denounced that tweet over the weekend as an attempt to incite violence against Omar, a freshman member of Congress who has previously found herself at the center of debate over controversial remarks she made about Israel and its lobbying efforts — comments that were denounced by Democrats.
Omar said in a statement Sunday night that she has received increased death threats since Trump's tweet Friday evening and that many of those threats directly referenced his video.
""Violent rhetoric and all forms of hate speech have no place in our society, much less from our country's Commander in Chief,"" she said in the statement.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi released a statement Sunday demanding Trump remove the video and saying she spoke with the House sergeant-at-arms following the president's tweet ""to ensure that Capitol Police are conducting a security assessment to safeguard Congresswoman Omar, her family and her staff.""
""They will continue to monitor and address the threats she faces,"" Pelosi, D-Calif., said. ""The President’s words weigh a ton, and his hateful and inflammatory rhetoric creates real danger. President Trump must take down his disrespectful and dangerous video.""
Omar has already been subjected to numerous death threats over the past months.
Ilhan Omar is a leader with strength and courage. She won't back down to Trump's racism and hate, and neither will we. The disgusting and dangerous attacks against her must end.
— Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) April 13, 2019 President Trump's inflammatory and dangerous rhetoric towards Ilhan Omar is jeopardizing her safety. He is deliberately putting her and all Muslim Americans in harm's way.
— Jay Inslee (@JayInslee) April 13, 2019 The President is inciting violence against a sitting Congresswoman—and an entire group of Americans based on their religion. It's disgusting. It's shameful. And any elected leader who refuses to condemn it shares responsibility for it.
— Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) April 13, 2019 For two years, this President has used the most powerful platform in the world to sow hate & division. He's done it again. Putting the safety of a sitting member of Congress @IlhanMN at risk & vilifying a whole religion is beyond the pale. I'll be blunt — we must defeat him.
— Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) April 13, 2019 Trump’s recent attacks on @IlhanMN are unacceptable—this is the same language that gives extremists license to carry out violence against our Muslim brothers and sisters. https://t.co/bUpAuFqzkH
— Cory Booker (@CoryBooker) April 14, 2019 Former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke also defended Omar during a campaign event in South Carolina, saying, ""This is an incitement to violence against Congresswoman Omar, against our fellow Americans who happen to be Muslim."" On Sunday , Warren added to her criticism, saying Trump ""is trying to incite violence and to divide us.""
""Those who don't speak out in the Republican leadership are complicit in what he is doing,"" she added. ""It is wrong.""
Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio said Sunday night on MSNBC's ""Kasie DC"" that Trump was trying to ""scare people.""
""I think it's an opportunity for Donald Trump to really try to discriminate against Muslims and to try to scare people,"" he said. ""This is nonsense. This is not how you heal our country. This is not how you lead.""
Omar's comments were a feature of the Sunday political talk shows, where both Democrats and Republicans addressed them.
Asked about Trump's tweet, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders told ABC's "" This Week "" Trump ""is wishing no ill will and certainly not violence towards anyone, but the president is absolutely and should be calling out the congresswoman for her not only one time, but history of anti-Semitic comments.""
""The bigger question is why aren’t Democrats doing the same thing?"" she added. ""It’s absolutely abhorrent the comments that she continues to make and has made and they look the other way.""
Sanders added that she finds Omar's comments ""to be absolutely disgraceful and unbefitting of a member of Congress, and I think that it’s a good thing that the president is calling her our for those comments.""
On CNN's "" State of the Union ,"" House Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., said he had no problem with Omar's comments.
""She was talking about discrimination against Muslim Americans,"" he said. ""And she just said that, after that happened, it was used as an excuse for lots of discrimination and for withdrawal of civil liberties. I have had some problems with some of her other remarks, but not with that one.""

This week, The Washington Post and multiple subsequent outlets reported that Trump administration officials had floated the idea of busing detained immigrants to so-called sanctuary cities as a way to retaliate against the president's political opponents. Though administration officials quickly said that the idea was pitched and quickly shot down, Trump said Friday that the administration was still contemplating the proposal.
Migrants from Honduras wait on the border bridge between Mexico and Guatemala in Ciudad Hidalgo, Mexico, last Thursday. Jose Cabezas / Reuters Then, The New York Times , citing three people briefed on the conversation, reported that Trump told acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan last week that the president would pardon him if he faced legal consequences for closing the southwestern border to migrants. It was unclear what Trump meant by the comments, and, according to one of the people briefed on the conversation, it was possible the president meant them as a joke, the newspaper reported, adding that the conversation alarmed Department of Homeland Security officials who were told of it.
In a series of Saturday tweets — some of which remain unclear — Trump went off about immigration policy.
""Just out: The USA has the absolute legal right to have apprehended illegal immigrants transferred to Sanctuary Cities,"" Trump wrote . ""We hereby demand that they be taken care of at the highest level, especially by the State of California, which is well known or its poor management & high taxes!""
The president earlier said Democrats must immediately change immigration laws or else sanctuary cities will have to act to take care of migrants. Trump also said he ""never offered Pardons to Homeland Security Officials,"" and, in another tweet, claimed the Times didn't check with his administration before publishing its report on the administration's plans for sanctuary cities, though Times reporters said they were in contact with the White House.
Full Kellyanne: 'We have an unserious Congress' on finding immigration solutions April 14, 2019 14:50 The immigration policy dustup comes after Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen resigned last week under pressure from Trump over his border demands. Claire Grady, the acting deputy Homeland Security Secretary who had been next in the agency’s line of succession, resigned shortly after. The quick level of turnover at the department caused some Republicans to fret over the administration's handling of the department.
On CNN's "" State of the Union ,"" House Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., said the report about Trump's conversation with McAleenan ""another instance of the President’s contempt for law.""
Calling for an illegal action would be ""exactly contrary to the key presidential duty and to his oath, which is to see that the laws are faithfully executed,"" Nadler said. ""That is the main job of the president, to see that the laws are faithfully executed. For the president to sabotage that goal by deliberately seeking to break the law is unforgivable.""
""It's part of a pattern of conduct that we certainly have to take a look at after we see [special counsel Robert Mueller's] report,"" he added.
Speaking about the idea of busing immigrants to sanctuary cities, Nadler said that would be a ""misuse of presidential power"" said said it seemed like an idea that originated in the mind of White House senior policy adviser Stephen Miller, who has taken a lead role in the administration's immigration policy.
""Probably Stephen Miller, who seems to be the boss of everybody on immigration, ought to come before Congress and explain some of these policies,"" Nadler said .
On ABC's "" This Week ,"" White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said that policy idea ""did not go further"" after it was first brought up because ""there were a lot of challenges and it probably didn’t make sense to move forward.""
""The president likes the idea, and Democrats have said they want these individuals into their communities, so let’s see if it works and everybody gets a win out of it,"" she added. ""Again, this is not the ideal situation. The ideal solution is simple; it’s for Congress, particularly Democrats in Congress, to sit down with the president, do their jobs, and help us stop this awful crisis that’s taking place at our border.""
Inslee: 'We are happy to take refugees' April 14, 2019 02:19 ABC's George Stephanopoulos responded that he was confused why the president liked the idea, saying it could encourage more immigrants to migrate into the U.S.
""Again, this isn't the president's plan,"" she said. ""His top priority is to stop the flow of illegal immigration coming into our country to begin with. Democrats and courts, frankly, keep tying the president's hands and stopping him from being able to do that.""
White House counselor Kellyanne Conway told NBC's ""Meet the Press"" that it was an ""unserious Congress"" that was at the root of the immigration problem. She conceded that Republicans ""failed to do their job when they were in charge — no doubt.""
Meanwhile, on the same program, Gov. Jay Inslee, D-Wash. and a 2020 presidential candidate, responded to Trump's sanctuary city threats, saying, ""You can't threaten somebody with something they're not afraid of. And we are not afraid of diversity in the state of Washington.""
“This is yet another act of bombastic chaos that’s simply not going to work for this ineffective president,” he said.

Agriculture census finds that llamas are disappearing. What happened?,www.nbcnews.com,Phil McCausland,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/llamas-disappearing-across-united-states-n994181,"The llama population in the United States appears to be disappearing, as an agriculture census released last week found that the pack animals' numbers in the country have decreased dramatically. There were nearly 145,000 llamas in the United States in 2002. By 2017, however, there were fewer than 40,000, according to the 2017 Census of Agriculture, which the U.S. Department of Agriculture publishes every five years.
The decline likely came as the llama market — once an industry that included high-rolling celebrities and athletes — quietly crashed, llama farmers, auctioneers and experts told NBC News.
""You used to go to the major sales and shows, and people would come in these Class A motorhomes. These people owned manufacturing plants, their own jet planes, whatever,"" said Mark Smith, who has farmed llama in Indiana for 25 years. ""They were driving the market when llamas were a good investment.""
But these pack animals native to South America seemed to only become valuable because people believed they were valuable. Their functional uses include providing fiber or working as pack animals. Llamas also sometimes guard sheep herds. None of those are particularly lucrative uses, however.
“Once the industry got beyond the novelty and breeding aspects, the question became: what do you do with them?” said Robert Van Saun, a professor of veterinary science at Penn State University who is an expert on llamas and alpacas.
Where did all the llamas go? Llama prices skyrocketed through from the 1980s into the 2000s.
Darrell Anderson, an auctioneer at one of the first production sales of llama held in the United States back in 1986 in Salem, Oregon, helped sell a llama that went for a record price of $220,000. The prices, he said, became unsustainable.

Irfan Khan / LA Times via Getty Images file The llama financial bubble burst slightly after the real estate market crashed in 2007, as people no longer had expendable income to feed this speculative industry. Without an economy around breeding and without a huge market for their meat or their fiber, llamas essentially became the equivalent of Bitcoin or Beanie Babies.
“It got to be an investment market and we lost a lot of the common folk,” Anderson said. ""It was nice at the time for the folks who were selling but it got to be more restrictive.""
That led farms to consolidate and many left the llama game entirely.
“In 2008 or 2009, we definitely saw a downturn,” said Susan Hannah, the operations manager for the International Llama Registry. “When we started here there was 13 of us. Now I work full-time and I have another gal who works part-time — so it’s not what it once was.”
As the dollars dried up, so did the llama herds.
Justin Timm's family got into llamas in the 1980s, and he bought his first animal at age 13 in the 1990s. He's watched the industry fluctuate for years, as both a farmer and auctioneer on the West Coast.
""It went from a time where literally nearly every female was being bred on a yearly basis to maybe 20 percent of the animals being bred on a bi-annual basis,"" said Timm, runs online llama auctions. He explained that the animals likely began disappearing naturally because, as people stopped breeding, the older animals died off.

Van Saun noted that llama herds faced increasing risk of parasites as winters become warmer due to climate change — a problem that has also resulted in major losses for goat and sheep producers.
“We’ve had an absolutely horrid time for the amount of rainfall we’ve had and the overcast weather on top of the warmer weather. It actually has been parasite heaven,” Van Saun said. “That certainly is only going to continue with global warming.”
The return of the llama? Despite the difficult times, many seem to believe the industry is beginning to pick up again and prices are growing for llamas, especially among breeders.
Smith, the Indiana llama farmer, recently sold a premium llama for $20,000 — which is one of the highest prices anyone has fetched for one animal in recent years.
""The market is coming back,"" Smith said. The quality of the llamas that breeders have in the United States is as good as they have ever been — but it’s not what it was back in the 80s or 90s.""
Llama auctioneers and farmers both said that while the 2017 USDA census saw a low population of llamas, that has only been good for llama farms to get back on their feet.
Farmers and breeders said that the low llama population has helped prices grow steadily for the past few years, but it's still a relatively affordable industry that almost anyone can participate in.
“You’ll have some of the wealthiest CEOs in the country participating alongside a blue-collar, minimum wage individual,” he added, “and in the llama community they are equals.”

Tiger Woods wins his fifth Masters title in his first major victory since 2008,www.nbcnews.com,msn.com,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/sports/tiger-woods-wins-his-fifth-masters-title-his-first-major-n994346,"Tiger Woods won his fifth Masters title on Sunday, marking his first major victory since the 2008 U.S. Open. Woods shot 13 under par through the tournament. His victory comes after four back surgeries that left him wondering in recent years if he could ever play again. Woods, 43, became the second-oldest winner of the Masters at Augusta National, after Jack Nicklaus who won at 46 in 1986.
Nicklaus, who has won the most majors, said Woods' win was ""fantastic.""
""A big 'well done' from me to @TigerWoods !"" he wrote on Twitter . ""I am so happy for him and for the game of golf. This is just fantastic!!!""
Woods entered the final round tied for second with Tony Finau, two strokes behind Francesco Molinari.
He finished the tournament with his signature fist pump and hugged his 10-year-old son, Charlie, mother, Kutilda, and 11-year-old daughter, Sam.
Among those watching avidly, President Donald Trump who tweeted during the tournament , saying Woods ""is looking GREAT!"" and then congratulating him as ""a truly Great Champion!""
Former President Barack Obama also recognized Woods on Twitter, writing: ""Congratulations, Tiger! To come back and win the Masters after all the highs and lows is a testament to excellence, grit, and determination.""
Following his win, Nike, which has sponsored the golfer since the start of his career, tweeted: ""Never stop chasing your crazy dream. #justdoit @TigerWoods "" and released a commercial starring Woods. Nike signed Woods in 1996.

— Mike Gavin (@MikeGavin7) April 14, 2019 Many social media users shared side-by-side images of Woods hugging his father, Earl, at the 18th hole after the 1997 Masters, and a photo from Sunday where he embraced his son. Woods won his first Masters title in 1997. His father died in May 2006. Woods reflected on the remixed father-son moment on Sunday, saying things had come full circle.
“To have my kids here it’s come full circle,” he said. “My dad was here in ‘97 and now I’m the dad with two kids there.”
Sunday was the first time Woods won a major when trailing going into the final round, and he needed some help from Molinari, the 54-hole leader who still was up two shots heading into the heart of Amen Corner.
And that's when all hell broke loose at Augusta.
Molinari's tee shot on the par-3 12th never had a chance, hitting the bank and tumbling into Rae's Creek for double bogey. Until then, Molinari had never trailed in a round that began early in threesomes to finish ahead of storms.
And then it seemed as though practically everyone had a chance.
Six players had a share of the lead at some point on the back. With the final group still in the 15th fairway, there was a five-way tie for the lead. And that's when Woods seized control, again with plenty of help.
Molinari's third shot clipped a tree and plopped straight down in the water for another double bogey. Woods hit onto the green, setting up a two-putt birdie for his first lead of the final round. Woods followed with a tee shot on the par-3 16th that rode down the slope next to the cup and settled two feet away for his final birdie.
That gave him a two-shot cushion, and no one was going to catch him.

MAP: How long people in your city are expected to live,www.nbcnews.com,msn.com,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/map-neighborhood-life-expectancy-united-states-n979141,"In America, money and education can mean the difference between a long life and an early death, and these differences can play out street by street. With a statewide average of 81.3 years, California’s 35-plus million residents enjoy the second-highest life expectancy in the United States (at an average 82 years, Hawaii residents live the longest). In wealthy suburbs, though, lifespans stretch longer.
Take suburban Los Angeles. In one section of Palos Verdes Estates, where the median income is $175,536 and 98 percent of the population graduated from high school, the expected lifespan is 86.4 years.
Eleven miles away in a section of Long Beach near Interstate 710, the median income is $54,167, less than a third of Palos Los Verdes. Twenty-one percent of the population didn't finish high school. Life expectancy in this area is 73.3 years, 13 years shorter than in Palos Verdes Estates.
These findings are part of an Associated Press analysis of new, detailed life-expectancy data from the National Center for Health Statistics . The life expectancy figures are specific to children born between 2010 and 2015. The analysis found strong relationships between income, education, health insurance coverage, racial segregation and life expectancy.
The analysis found that life expectancies: Increased by six months with a $10,000 increase in median income. Decreased by eighteen months with a 10 percent increase in unemployment. Decreased by 10 months with a 10 percent increase in residents without a high school diploma. Decreased by eight months with a 10 percent increase in the black population. The NCHS used death records from 2010 to 2015 along with the Census Bureau’s decennial census and American Community Survey data to calculate lifespans specific to census tracts. Census tracts are statistical areas with populations of approximately 4,000 people that are sometimes equivalent to a city neighborhood, and sometimes larger. The data allows readers to see differences in life expectancy from place to place within their cities or towns.
Differences between adjacent areas can be striking. For instance, in North Carolina's Edgecombe County, tracts 213 and 203 are adjacent tracts with similar economic, educational and employment percentages.
But tract 213, with an expected lifespan of 82.2 years, is 30 percent black.
Tract 203 is 84 percent black and has an expected lifespan of just 74.7 years.
Overall, researchers at the NCHS found that of the tracts with the lowest life expectancy, about half have mostly black populations, 57 percent have low education and 61 percent have low incomes.

Pete Buttigieg officially announces 2020 presidential campaign,www.nbcnews.com,msn.com,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/pete-buttigieg-officially-announces-2020-presidential-campaign-n994046,"SOUTH BEND, Ind. — Pete Buttigieg, the 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Indiana, officially announced his presidential bid Sunday afternoon, hoping to make history as the youngest-ever, and the first-ever openly gay, commander in chief. Speaking to a standing-room-only crowd inside a downtown tech hub that had once been the home of a long-ago-shuttered Studebaker car factory, Buttigieg promised to bring to the country the kind of change and innovation he’d helped to instill in his native South Bend.
""My name is Pete Buttigieg. They call me Mayor Pete. I am a proud son of South Bend, Indiana. And I am running for President of the United States,"" he said, prompting a wave of adoring screams from the crowd. ""I recognize the audacity of doing this as a Midwestern millennial mayor. More than a little bold — at age 37— to seek the highest office in the land.""
Pete Buttigieg on running for president: 'It's about winning an era' April 14, 2019 01:58 Touting the advances his native city made under his leadership — including a revitalized downtown and slashed unemployment — Buttigieg proclaimed that ""South Bend is back.""
And he got in more than a few digs at President Donald Trump, telling the crowd that he was going to ""tell a different story than 'Make America Great Again.'""
""There is a myth being sold to industrial and rural communities: the myth that we can stop the clock and turn it back,"" he said. ""It comes from people who think the only way to reach communities like ours is through resentment and nostalgia, selling an impossible promise of returning to a bygone era that was never as great as advertised to begin with.""
“The horror show in Washington is mesmerizing, all-consuming,"" he added. ""But starting today, we are going to change the channel. Sometimes a dark moment brings out the best in us, what is good in us, dare I say, what is great in us.”
Buttigieg unveiled the three-pronged campaign message that he’s been sharing in bars and living rooms in recent weeks in the early-voting states of Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina: Security (“the idea that security and patriotism belong to one political party needs to end now”) and democracy (“no issue we care about, from gun safety to immigration, from climate to education to paid family leave, will be handled well unless our democracy is in better shape.”)
And freedom.
“Our conservative friends care about freedom, but only make it part of the journey,"" he said. ""They only see ‘freedom from,' freedom from taxes, freedom from regulation … as though government were the only thing that can make you unfree.
“But that’s not true. Your neighbor can make you unfree. Your cable company can make you unfree. There’s a lot more to your freedom than the size of your government.”
Touching on the message that helped catapult the last Democratic president, Barack Obama, to office, Buttigieg mentioned the word “change” at least 10 times, according to his prepared remarks, announcing at one point that “change is coming, ready or not.”
“The question of our time is whether families and workers will be defeated by the changes beneath us or whether we will master them and make them work toward a better everyday life for us all,” he said.
The highly anticipated announcement marked the latest chapter in Buttigieg’s meteoric rise from the mayor of the fourth-most-populous city in the nation’s 17th-most-populated state to a legitimate presidential contender.
Pete Buttigieg expected to formally announce 2020 presidential run April 12, 2019 02:09 Buttigieg had previously launched a presidential exploratory committee in January, leading to a barrage of television interviews and newspaper articles highlighting his diverse résumé. Buttigieg, the son of two Notre Dame University professors, attended Harvard; went on to become a Rhodes Scholar; did a stint at the consulting firm McKinsey & Co.; was elected as the mayor of South Bend at the age of 29; took a leave of absence during his first term to serve in Afghanistan as a naval intelligence officer; came out as gay in a column in his local newspaper a few months before his re-election; was re-elected with nearly 80 percent of the vote; married his partner Chasten in a church ceremony that was live-streamed on the Internet; and wrote a best-selling book.
On Sunday, Buttigieg made frequent mention of each of these parts of his résumé, but spent particular time addressing his military service and his coming out in a bluntly personal way — and at times melded stories from each part of his life together in compelling yarns that prompted loud applause.
“The men and women who got in my vehicle, they didn’t care if I was a Democrat or a Republican,” Buttigieg said about his time in Afghanistan as a Navy intelligence officer.
“They cared about whether I had selected the route with the fewest IED threats, not whether my father was documented or undocumented when he immigrated here,"" he said. ""They cared about whether my M-4 was locked and loaded, not whether I was going home to a girlfriend or a boyfriend.”
Mayor Pete Buttigieg announces his presidential bid Sunday in South Bend, Indiana. John Gress / Reuters Buttigieg spent the months after his exploratory committee launch crisscrossing the country , introducing himself to crowds in the early-voting states of Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada, delivering a highly personal speech about how he wrestled with his sexual orientation , and taking shots at Vice President Mike Pence over his stances on gay marriage and LGBTQ equality.
He joins an exceptionally crowded field of candidates vying for his party's nomination . There are at least 14 major candidates in the race — 17 if you count three other semi-well known contenders — and almost half a dozen others who could still announce.
Democratic voters and politics watchers, however, have quickly taken notice of the millennial mayor, expressing admiration over his ability to speak seven languages, praising his intellectual ideas like “intergenerational justice,” and embracing a handful of ambitious policy proposals, like abolishing the electoral college.
Inside Studebaker Building 84 — which used to be a Studebaker car factory that closed in the 1960s but was repurposed as a tech and data hub by Buttigieg — several thousand supporters (some who traveled as far as California) gobbled up every word uttered by the former Rhodes scholar, frequently breaking out into raucous screams.
Hundreds of supporters were turned away from the event after it reached capacity, and chose instead to watch the event on a projection screen outside the building in freezing cold rain.
Before he delivered his speech, Buttigieg addressed the overflow crowd outside, telling them that “standing in the rain helping someone run for office is an act of hope.”
One of the attendees on Sunday, 57-year-old Terry Burns of Indianapolis, said Buttigieg “doesn’t seem like a typical politician, seems honest and thoughtful, would make a good level-headed president.”
His wife Lisa Burns, 61, said she thought it “would be nice to have some one smart in the White House for a change,"" adding, ""I’ve already decided to support him and nothing can change that.”
The money has been coming in, too.
Earlier this month, Buttigieg announced that he’d raised more than $7 million since launching his exploratory committee — a whopping amount for an until-now-relative unknown figure and one that has put him ahead of everyone in the Democratic race in terms of total money raised, except Vermont independent Sen. Bernie Sanders, former Texas Rep Beto O’Rourke and California Sen. Kamala Harris.
Last week, a pair of polls put Buttigieg in third place in Iowa (a Monmouth University poll had him getting the support of 9 percent of likely caucus-goers, behind 16 percent for Sanders and 27 percent for former Vice President Joe Biden, who is expected to join the race later this month) and in New Hampshire (a Saint Anselm College poll showed him 11 percent, trailing Sanders, who got 16 percent, and Biden, who got 23 percent).
The speed of Buttigieg's ascent isn’t lost on the newly minted candidate.
“A month ago,” he joked during an appearance last week on “The Ellen DeGeneres Show,” ""we were just trying to get people to say my name.”

A special police unit probing killings from the Northern Ireland conflict, the Legacy Investigation Branch, said it was interrogating the 66-year-old former member of the Parachute Regiment, the elite force that shot to death 13 Catholic protesters in the Bogside district of Londonderry. Catholic leaders and lawyers representing relatives of the dead welcomed the arrest and said they expected more retired soldiers to be arrested.

To the fury of Irish nationalists, the original British probe in 1972 exonerated him and the other soldiers. But after 12 years, the most expensive fact-finding commission in British history concluded in 2010 that the soldiers had opened fire first and without warning, not in response to attacks from the outlawed Irish Republican Army; all but one of the Bloody Sunday victims were unarmed at the time they were killed; and none posed a threat to the soldiers.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. SUBSCRIBE April 14, 2019, 11:22 PM GMT / Updated April 15, 2019, 12:12 AM GMT By Monica Alba WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump’s campaign raked in $30 million in the first quarter of 2019 and had more than $40 million cash on hand, amassing a record war chest and far outpacing the field of Democratic candidates heading into the 2020 race, according to the campaign. Combined with $46 million raised by the Republican National Committee, the full Trump re-election effort is expected to have a grand total of $82 million in the bank, with the campaign doubling what it had at the end of last year. Trump's total is more than the top two Democratic candidates combined — Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who pulled in $18.2 million for the quarter and California Sen. Kamala Harris, who took in $12 million. In all, the eight Democratic campaigns that have reported their totals ahead of Monday's filing deadline have raised a combined $65.8 million, although none of those candidates started raising money as early as the Trump campaign. As the incumbent, Trump already has certain advantages when it comes to raising money. But the fundraiser-in-chief has taken this traditional benefit further than any of his predecessors. He is the only president to ever file re-election paperwork the evening he was inaugurated, and his team has been steadily seeking donations ever since. By comparison, former President Barack Obama had not announced his 2012 re-election plans until after the first quarter had passed in 2011. Over the first two years of the Trump administration, his campaign had brought in nearly $130 million, easily beating out any other sitting president at this stage. The Trump-Pence ticket has a head-start over the crowded field of Democrats vying for their party’s nomination, something the campaign is quick to point out. After a primary campaign, “we expect them to be bruised, battered, and broke,” a senior campaign official told NBC News. The bigger fundraising picture for the Trump effort will be revealed once the campaign files its quarterly report with the FEC Monday, including details about how much and where the campaign has spent thus far. Trump’s 2020 setup is far more traditional than his first presidential bid, when he even pledged to self-fund his run. “I don’t need anybody’s money. I’m using my own money. I’m not using the lobbyists. I’m not using donors. I don’t care. I’m really rich,” he said during his 2015 launch, after coming down the escalator at Trump Tower. Now, with the full support and resources of the RNC, the president’s campaign is planning to launch a “bundling” program for super-donors to help bring in more money from wealthy supporters in their circles. Trump’s entire 2016 campaign brought in $333 million. At this pace, their second attempt will easily outraise that. Campaign manager Brad Parscale believes they may spend $1 billion this time around, which would be three times more than what it cost last cycle. Aides attribute the huge first quarter haul, in part, to the end of the Mueller investigation and Attorney General Bill Barr’s four-page letter that stated the special counsel did not find a criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russian officials to influence the 2016 election. Immediately after it was released, Trump’s 2020 staffers launched a strategy to capitalize on the positive headlines for the president. They blasted fundraising emails, text messages, new videos and even created new merchandise for the campaign website featuring the top-line summary from Barr. “We typically do not give numbers on individual fundraising pushes, but the fundraising in the aftermath of the Barr letter ranks among our very strong fundraising efforts. Our supporters were rightfully frustrated by two years of Democrat lies,” a Trump campaign spokeswoman said. The timing also likely played a part. The first quarter deadline ended March 31, well before any version of the Mueller report was sent to Congress or made public. The redacted, nearly 400-page version is expected to be released in the coming days. Monica Alba "
Veterans could be first to pay as DeVos rolls back for-profit college oversight,www.nbcnews.com,,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/veterans-could-be-first-pay-devos-rolls-back-profit-college-n985891,"WASHINGTON — Eric Dean made a career of calling military veterans to urge them to enroll at Ashford University, a for-profit school based in San Diego that offers online degrees. Dean, who was instructed in sales techniques at Ashford, said he tried to befriend hundreds of current and former sailors and soldiers — many from the nation’s poorest communities — to convince them to attend. “I’ve seen the inside,” Dean told NBC News in an interview, saying he had been “pressured into essentially selling my soul to throw fellow veterans under the bus” by misleading them about the educational outcomes about the school's graduation and job-placement rates.
Dean, who’d served in the Navy, quit Ashford in December 2017 because he said he objected to the school's practices and now says veterans with PTSD were among his recruits.
Military veterans dine on campus at Georgetown University in Washington on July 30, 2015. Bill O'Leary / The Washington Post via Getty Images file Under President Barack Obama, the Department of Education cracked down on for-profits like Ashford. With its high sticker price, questionable job placement success and 16 percent graduation rate — considerably lower than the national average of about 60 percent . Ashford was described in a Chronicle of Higher Education investigation as “a poster child for the ills of the for-profit college sector,” and the school was sued by the state of California, which said it was misleading students about tuition cost and burying them in loan debt.
While the Obama Administration didn’t solve all the problems associated with the for-profit college industry, it successfully created new rules intended to help rein in the worst-performing schools and to protect taxpayer dollars. Veterans and low-income Americans can qualify for large sums of federal aid, making them top recruitment priorities for for-profits.
Now, the Trump Administration is trying to overturn those rules — and veterans and low-income Americans are the most at risk. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos has begun a months long process to unwind the Obama-era rules, easing oversight of for-profits’ use of tax dollars and protections for defrauded students.
DeVos has argued the for-profit industry offers an important alternative to traditional four-year colleges and universities for many Americans seeking training in specific trades.
“Instead of targeting schools simply by their tax status, this administration is working to ensure students have transparent, meaningful information about all colleges and all programs,” DeVos said last year, announcing plans to overturn the rules. DeVos did not respond to an NBC interview request.
In response, House Financial Services Committee Chair Maxine Waters, D-Calif., told NBC News she plans to introduce two bills ending the incentives given to for-profit schools to recruit military members and veterans.
“I am absolutely concerned. We may be going back to the worst of times with this industry” when minorities, poor people and veterans were the targets, Waters said.
Waters said she hopes there will be bipartisan support to intervene.
“Democrats and Republicans alike wax eloquently about their support for veterans,” she said. ""Anytime there is some effort for veterans people want to get on board.”
Veterans targeted Trump frequently proclaims his devotion to the military and veterans. “Nobody’s done more for the military than me,” he has often said. But veterans are among the students most at risk from the aggressive recruitment tactics used by for-profit colleges.
For-profit schools cost on average twice as much as public colleges , and most of their revenues come directly from taxpayers through federal financial aid. The schools also spend heavily on marketing and recruiting students who qualify for federal aid, especially veterans.
Here’s why: For every dollar of GI Bill funding for-profit schools secure, they qualify for an additional $9 in federal student aid. For-profit schools have been eight of the top 10 recipients of GI Bill tuition and fee payments since 2009, according to an analysis of VA data by Veterans Education Success, an advocacy group for veterans that has worked against the tactics used by for-profit schools.
Waters’ legislation would end that incentive and require for-profits to get more of their money from students who can pay privately before qualifying for any federal aid, she said.
The legislation followed years of effort by the Obama administration to slow the volume of federal dollars going to for-profit schools that have a history of poor outcomes, including low graduation rates. Like much of the Democratic agenda, the effort is likely to be resisted in the GOP-led Senate.
Betsy DeVos proposes to cut billions of dollars from education March 27, 2019 01:46 A 2017 lawsuit by California’s attorney general alleges Ashford misled prospective students and engaged in other illegal practices. Dean says recruitment techniques included avoiding direct answers about low graduation rates in order to maximize enrollment. “It was all unethical, the way we were misleading students,” said Dean.
The Department of Education under Obama created a “borrower defense” rule, making it easier for students to be relieved of their federal student loans if a school is found to have used illegal or deceptive tactics in recruiting them.
A “ gainful employment ” rule required schools to demonstrate their graduates are making a living wage.
The Obama-era rules had an impact, according to former Obama Education Department senior policy adviser Ben Miller. Miller told NBC News his analysis shows that from 2010 to 2018, federal funding for for-profit schools facing lawsuits and investigations dropped by 75 percent, or $14.4 billion and that many of those schools closed.
An improving economy was a factor in the drop, as fewer people pursue higher education when the economy is strong. Still, schools that weren’t under investigation saw their federal revenues drop by just 14 percent during the same period, the analysis found.
John King, a former Education Secretary under Obama who helped write the original rules, said DeVos’s efforts would have an insidious effect.
“It seems these measures are intended to resuscitate the industry and allow new bad actors to emerge or to allow bad actors that have lost a lot of enrollment to be able to grow again,” he said.
“A Waste of Time” After four tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan, during which he earned a Bronze Star, U.S. Army drill sergeant Andres Figueroa wanted to start a new career at a TV sports channel. He enrolled at Full Sail University, a for-profit in Orlando, Florida, to learn how to operate camera equipment.
Recruiters for the school had portrayed Full Sail as one of the top film schools in the country, Figueroa told NBC News, and had assured him that graduates were virtually guaranteed employment with various “industry partners.”
None of that, Figueroa said, turned out to be true.
“It was a waste of time, waste of money and I don’t even tell anybody that I went there. I feel duped,” Figueroa said, claiming he had received only limited hands-on training and job placement assistance.
Figueroa estimated it would take him 10 years to repay loans for the part of his Full Sail bill that 20 months of his GI funds didn’t cover. Annual tuition at the school is $29,398, double that of the nearby University of Central Florida, which boasts a significantly higher graduation rate and higher post-graduation salaries, Education Department statistics show.
Casey Tanous, Full Sail’s public relations director, said the school’s curriculum is, in fact, rooted in “hands-on” education. For any student to suggest he’d been duped is “hard to believe,” Tanous said.
“Film students spend hundreds of hours using gear and software that is specific to the learning objectives of the course and the program,” she said, noting that any student with concerns is encouraged to “reach out to us.”
While Full Sail has not drawn as many high-profile legal challenges as has Ashford, it ranks near the top of a Department of Veterans Affairs list of 1,600 schools with official complaints filed against them. NBC also found 13 complaints about Full Sail filed with the Florida attorney general’s office.
Only three other schools, all for-profits — the University of Phoenix, Colorado Technical University and DeVry University (online) — had more complaints.
Colorado Technical University, part of Career Education Corporation, aggressively courts veterans. One former CTU recruiter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of career retaliation, said the school often targeted the poorest veterans — many of whom struggle with PTSD — who would qualify for the most federal aid.
Because the enrollment process was often rushed, the recruiter said, some agreed to take out additional loans without realizing it.
In a statement, CTU said it “strongly disagrees” with the characterization of its recruitment.
“We have a thorough process to inform and counsel incoming students. We have a strong record of supporting veterans,” the statement said.
Last month, Career Education Corporation reached a settlement with 48 states and the District of Columbia that accused it of misleading students about the costs of its programs, their job prospects and using “emotionally charged language emphasizing the pain in prospective students’ lives to pressure them into enrolling.” The company denied allegations of wrongdoing or liability.
DeVos Doubles Down DeVos’s efforts to rescue for-profits from the Obama era rules conflict with other actions the Trump administration has taken against the risks associated with the for-profit education industry.
In August 2017, Trump signed the “Forever GI Bill,” which restored GI benefits to some veterans whose schools had gone out of business. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated 5,000 veterans would be eligible through that legislation to receive $170 million in restored benefits over ten years.
U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos at the White House in Washington on Aug. 16, 2018. Leah Millis / Reuters In 2018, a Department of Veterans Affairs inspector general report warned that some $2.3 billion in taxpayer-financed GI Bill money could go to “improper payments to ineligible colleges” over the next five years.
Education Department spokeswoman Liz Hill told NBC News that transparency around for-profits would help weed out underperforming schools. She cited an interagency working group that strives to inform veterans about “scams.”
“Of course bad actors need to be shut down and taken off the field,” Hill said, adding that the administration will overhaul an online “College Scorecard” which allows students to compare data on schools, including costs and graduation rates.
“We’re trying to give students and veterans actionable and meaningful information about all schools,” said Hill.
The online courses offered by for-profit schools “appeal to student veterans’ need for flexibility,” Hill said, as they tend to be older, married and supporting kids and family or have a disability.
Still, critics say DeVos’s decision to ease rules — and, separately, to reinstate an accreditor — organizations responsible for accrediting colleges — behind two major for-profits that are now defunct — will make it easier for problematic schools to prey on veterans. DeVos says the rules placed unfair burdens on for-profits that public and nonprofit institutions don’t face.
DeVos reinstated the Accrediting Council for Independent Colleges and Schools (ACICS), one of the nation’s most controversial for-profit accreditors, after the Obama Administration withdrew the agency’s recognition, citing a “profound lack of compliance” with the “most basic” responsibilities of an accreditor. A federal judge had ordered DeVos to reconsider the decision, finding the Obama administration didn’t review thousands of pages of evidence. DeVos’s decision is now under review by the department’s inspector general.
“DeVos has taken a number of steps to literally steer taxpayer money toward the very worst quality schools,” said Carrie Wofford, president of Veterans Education Success, which provides free legal services and career counseling to veterans. “With the other hand, she’s stripping out all of the protections students had. It’s almost as if she’s bent on trying to prop up a handful of bad actor companies.”
Administration Connections The efforts of for-profits to target veterans can be aggressive. Some pay for recruiting leads from websites masquerading as official Pentagon or government sites. One of these, GIBill.com , was effectively shut down in a settlement with a group of state attorneys general over defrauding veterans. While the company that operated the site, QuinStreet, denied wrongdoing, it was forced to transfer the site to the VA.
Other sites designed to generate leads for marketers, like Military-colleges.com , continue today. It is owned by a company called Education Dynamics, which makes a profit by selling leads.
Trump, who once ran the for-profit Trump University, agreed in 2017 to pay $25 million to settle a class-action lawsuit by students who said they were defrauded. Trump repeatedly denied the fraud claims and said he could have won at trial.
And Devos’s team at the Education Department includes advisers who have lobbied for the for-profit school industry.
One is senior adviser Robert Eitel, a former vice president at Bridgepoint Education, Ashford’s parent company. Another, Principle Deputy Undersecretary Diane Auer Jones, recommended DeVos reinstate the controversial accreditor ACICS, giving it a year to fix its compliance problems.
ACICS accredited two large for-profit schools, ITT Tech and Corinthian Colleges, which were subsequently shut down amid lawsuits, investigations and Obama administration sanctions. Bridgepoint has received significant regulatory attention, including a $31 million fine in 2016 by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for engaging in allegedly “deceptive acts and practices” regarding students' monthly loan payments. Bridgepoint denied the company intentionally deceived students and said it reached the agreement to resolve the dispute.
The two for-profit schools that have received the most GI Bill-funded tuition payments since 2009, the University of Phoenix and Education Management Corporation , have both paid hefty settlements to the federal and many state governments to resolve claims that they pressured students to sign up. EDMC in 2015 agreed to pay $95.5 million to resolve allegations it violated federal law by paying employees based on student enrollment, even as it said the claims were without merit. In 2009, the University of Phoenix similarly agreed to a $78.5 million settlement, even as it denied the allegations of improper incentive compensation.
In total, despite the Obama administration administration’s efforts to rein in the nonprofit industry, eight schools have collected some $34.7 billion in GI Bill tuition and fees since 2009, according to Wofford’s group.
Ashford With veterans so financially desirable at for-profits like Ashford, Dean said he faced pressure from his superiors to meet monthly quotas and “enroll them no matter what.” The goal, Dean said, was to keep students signed up for at least three weeks until they became “financially liable,” or ineligible for a refund.
Dean’s claims were echoed in a 2017 lawsuit brought by the state of California against Ashford, alleging the school’s sales people made “false and misleading statements to prospective students to meet their enrollment targets.”
The lawsuit has not been resolved. In a statement responding to the suit, Bridgepoint, which owns Ashford, said the school’s online education program is a “model” for bettering the lives of “people who did not, or who were unable to, pursue more traditional avenues to degrees” and that thousands of graduates attest to its quality.
In addition to Dean, NBC News interviewed a second longtime former Ashford military recruiter who spoke on the condition of anonymity out concern for retribution but corroborated Dean’s claims. Dean said he left because he didn’t like the company’s recruitment tactics. Ashford did not comment on why he left.
In response to the recruiters’ claims, Ashford spokeswoman Dori Abel said the school never targeted its “marketing materials or advertising campaigns specially to veterans, low-income or otherwise.”
The school has a “strong compliance program,” Abel said, including a whistleblower hotline. There is no record of any calls to the hotline that reflected Dean’s concerns during the time he worked there, she added.
Such allegations, Abel said, represented “an orchestrated effort among certain activist groups to paint our entire sector as irresponsible.”
For his part, Dean said he had, in fact, complained to a manager about “unethical” practices at the school some four months before he quit but never got a response.
Dean said his recruits included Vietnam and Iraq veterans who openly confided about their struggles with PTSD.
“It was exploiting their emotions,” Dean said. “I’d say, ‘Do it for your kids. Your family never went to college. You’ll be so proud of yourself.’”

Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. SUBSCRIBE April 15, 2019, 1:17 AM GMT By Alex Johnson A nonprofit organization affiliated with the FBI confirmed that hackers breached the web servers of multiple chapters and published the names and addresses of hundreds of law enforcement personnel and thousands of other people online. The hacked materials , which were released late last week and obtained Sunday by NBC News, include names, job descriptions, email addresses and, in some cases, street addresses of more than 23,000 people in multiple databases. More than 1,000 of the email addresses belong to the FBI.gov domain and the domains of other federal, state and local law enforcement agencies. Several dozen other identities, included in a database that hackers say are ""people being watched by the FBI,"" are attached to the domains of major news organizations, including NBC News. In a statement, FBI National Academy Associates, an organization supporting graduates of the FBI Academy, confirmed that the websites of three of its local chapters were breached and that ""personal information has been obtained to be sold on the web."" The organization said it was still investigating along with federal authorities, but it said it had determined that its national database wasn't affected. July 2018: Russian hackers elusive but not untouchable July 19, 2018 02:42 The materials appear to have been made public as a proof of concept, establishing that the hackers are to be taken seriously. The hacking group — which NBC News isn't naming, along with other information that could lead to the materials — said it was in possession of even more sensitive information that it hoped to sell. In posts that continued on Sunday, the hackers also prominently promoted what they described as a ransomware encryption package that they hoped to provide to other hackers. So far, the tool ""hasn't found its way into the wild,"" said Brett Callow, a spokesman for Emsisoft, a security company that released a decryption tool for the malware over the weekend. But ""in terms of seriousness, it could be very serious,"" Callow said in an interview. ""Information for FBI staff is now in the public domain."" Emsisoft's head of security, Fabian Wosar, a widely respected ransomware expert, on Sunday described the malware code as unique, saying by email that there were no clues to indicate it was the work of a previously known actor. Among their materials, the hackers said they had ""been working quietly since 2014, and did not particularly attract attention, but the time has come to change the world."" While bad actors online will often ""chaff"" their communications with false information to mislead investigators, a possible clue to the hackers' motives beyond profit could be a single post on Sunday declaring: ""We demand freedom for Peter Levashov."" In September, Levashov, of St. Petersburg, Russia, pleaded guilty to causing intentional damage to a personal computer, conspiracy, wire fraud and aggravated identity theft in connection with one of the world's largest spambots, Kelihos, variants of which began infecting hundreds of thousands of computers around the world in 2010. Court documents unsealed in the case showed that federal investigators had had Levashov's Apple iCloud account under surveillance since mid-2016, which is believed to have yielded the evidence prosecutors needed to extradite him to the United States. Sentencing is scheduled for Sept. 6 in U.S. District Court in Connecticut.

Abrams made the comment during an appearance on an upcoming episode of Pod Save America, which is coming out Thursday afternoon.
Despite her narrow loss in the 2018 gubernatorial race, Abrams' bid cemented her status as a rising star among Democrats and had supporters pulling for her to either run for president or the Senate.
Late last month, she ruled out a Senate bid, arguing that it was not ""the best role for me in this battle for our nation's future.""

— Pod Save America (@PodSaveAmerica) May 9, 2019 Facebook Twitter Email Ben Kamisar 3 days ago Biden with big lead in New Hampshire poll WASHINGTON—Former Vice President Joe Biden holds a significant lead over Vermont Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders in New Hampshire, a new Monmouth poll released Thursday finds.
Biden has support from 36 percent of registered Democrats and unaffiliated voters deemed likely to vote in the 2020 primary. Sanders is in second with 18 percent, followed by South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg's 9 percent, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren's 8 percent, and 6 percent for Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif.
Warren is the top second choice out of those polled, with 15 percent to Harris' 9 percent.
Biden, Sanders, Warren, Harris and Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., are the only candidates of which at least two-thirds of the electorate has an opinion. All of those candidates have strong favorable ratings, with Warren's 24 percent unfavorable rating the highest of the group.
Buttigieg, former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke, and Sens. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn, and Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., are known by at least half of the eelctorate.
Out of all of the candidates who are familiar to at least half of the electorate, Biden has the highest net-favorable rating (+65 percentage points) by far, followed by Sanders (54), Harris (50), Buttigieg (47), Booker (42) and Warren (39).
New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and entrepreneur Andrew Yang are the only two politicians tested whose favorable rating is underwater.
Monmouth polled 376 New Hampshire voters likely to vote in the Democratic primary from May 2 and May 7. The polls's margin of error is 5.1 percentage points.
Facebook Twitter Email Ben Kamisar 3 days ago Former CIA officer Valerie Plame running for House in New Mexico WASHINGTON — Former CIA officer Valerie Plame, whose undercover status was leaked during the early years of former President George W. Bush's administration, is running for Congress in New Mexico.
Plame announced her bid for the seat being vacated by Democratic Rep. Ben Ray Luján's Senate bid, arguing that her run is part of extending her service that was ""cut short by partisan politics"" when her cover was blown in 2003.
""My career in the CIA was cut short by partisan politics, but I’m not done serving our country. We need more people in Congress with the courage to stand up for what’s right,"" she said in a statement.
""It’s why I couldn’t be prouder than to have the chance to represent my friends and neighbors of Northern New Mexico. I will work as hard defending my fellow New Mexicans in Washington as I did defending our country from nuclear threats.”
A handful of other Democrats have discussed running in a district that leans heavily in favor of the Democrats—2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton won the district by 15 points in 2016.
Plame was a covert CIA officer who worked on counter-proliferation issues as the Bush administration was looking into whether Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein was working toward developing nuclear weapons.
Shortly after Plame's husband, diplomat Joe Wilson, wrote a New York Times column where he argued the ""intelligence related to Iraq's nuclear weapons program was twisted to exaggerate the Iraqi threat,"" Plame's identity was outed in a Washington Post story.
A former State Department official eventually admitted to leaking her name to the media, and Scooter Libby, then-Vice President Dick Cheney's chief of staff, was convicted for lying to investigators.
President Trump pardoned Libby last year .
Facebook Twitter Email Ben Kamisar 4 days ago Hickenlooper: My life experience separates me from Bennet WASHINGTON—John Hickenlooper, the former Democratic governor of Colorado, argued Wednesday that his life experience differentiates himself from the other Colorado Democrat in the presidential race, Sen. Michael Bennet.
During Wednesday's interview on ""MTP Daily,"" Hickenlooper praised Bennet as one ""of my favorite people, one of my oldest friends."" But he argued that voters who are used to casting their ballots for both men should look to their resumes to help separate the two presidential hopefuls.
""We've had very different lives. His experience is: He's a lawyer, super smart, super talented, super committed. But he's been mostly in Washington, he spent a few years working in private equity,"" Hickenlooper said.
""I was a scientist, and i worked professionally as a geologist. I was out of work a few years, that's relevant, then I opened a brewpub long before people knew what they were.""
""I transformed a community by getting everyone to get to work together, was a top-5 big city mayor in America and then one of the top governors in America.""
The two Coloradans have a long history—Bennet served as Hickenlooper's chief of staff while the latter was the mayor of Denver.

During a town hall in Mason City, Iowa, O'Rourke evoked a conversation he had with a student this week in Iowa who teared up while telling the former Texas Democratic congressman she was afraid that she would get killed in school.
He went on to argue that universal background checks would ""save lives"" and that politicians should buck political pressure to pass stricter gun control regulations.
""There are more than 30,000 gun deaths in this country every single year, and no other country on the face of the planet even comes close. So there's something either inherently evil or violent about our fellow Americans, or this is a human-caused problem with a human solution,"" O'Rourke said.

Facebook Twitter Email Leigh Ann Caldwell 4 days ago Kamala Harris rolls out bill to boost public defenders WASHINGTON — California senator and presidential candidate Kamala Harris is known as an effective prosecutor. Now she’s unveiling legislation to help public defenders in an attempt to counter criticism she’s received as being overly aggressive in her previous job.
The legislation would aim to incentivize public defenders, who are usually paid less, are less resourced and overworked, compared to prosecutors.
“As a career prosecutor, I know that when public defenders lack sufficient resources, they are unable to provide an adequate defense and the system doesn’t work,” Harris said in a statement. “Our Constitution gives every defendant the right to an attorney, but it’s not enough just to have a lawyer. Defendants in criminal cases need lawyers who have enough time, money, and resources to challenge the prosecution and provide a strong defense.”
Jon Rapping, the founder of The Gideon’s Project, an organization that provides training and resources for public defenders, calls the proposed bill “a good start.”
“I am encouraged,” Rapping said. “I think it is a recognition that public defenders must be part of the conversation” of criminal justice reform.
Harris, who worked as a district attorney in San Francisco and then as California’s attorney general before being elected to the Senate in 2017, and has highlighted her experience as a prosecutor and used it to her advantage. Her background has been beneficial especially when grilling Trump administration officials, including Attorney General William Barr , testifying before the Senate.
She has also come under fire from some progressives and public defenders in California for some of her policies and practices as a prosecutor.
Lara Bazelon, the former director of the Loyola Law School Project for the Innocent in Los Angeles, wrote an opinion piece in the New York Times saying that she’s not a progressive prosecutor.
“Time after time, when progressives urged her to embrace criminal justice reforms,” Bazelon wrote, “Ms. Harris opposed them or stayed silent.”
Bazelon pointed to her support of punishing parents of overly truant students, withholding evidence that could have unravelled convictions, supported the death penalty and opposed a bill that would mandate her office investigate shootings by police officers.
The legislation would create a $250 million grant program to fund public defense, including ensuring pay parity between public defenders and prosecutors and implementing work load limits. It would expand the student loan repayment program to $75 million from $25 million. It would also provide money to train public defenders and require data about the use of public defenders and if those who need the service are receiving it.
Facebook Twitter Email Ben Kamisar 5 days ago Inslee: Doctors can't help us 'if we don't solve climate change' WASHINGTON—Washington Democratic Gov. Jay Inslee argued Tuesday that climate change is an all-encompassing issue that should resonate with even those who see health care as a more pressing concern.
When asked on Tuesday's broadcast of ""MTP Daily"" on MSNBC what he thinks about polls showing that voters see health care as a more important issue to them than climate change, Inslee connected the two issues.
""There are not enough doctors and nurses on the planet Earth to protect our health if we don’t solve climate change. This is a health care issue first and foremost,"" he said.
“The thing about climate change is it's not a single issue, it is all the issues.""

Facebook Twitter Email Ben Kamisar 5 days ago Trump campaign blasts 'dishonest fundraising groups' after report about top ally WASHINGTON — President Trump's campaign issued a blistering statement Tuesday condemning ""alleged scam groups"" that profit off his name days after a new report called into question an outside group run by one of the president's former top campaign hands.
The unsigned statement from the Trump campaign admonished ""any organization that deceptively uses the President’s name, likeness, trademarks, or branding and confuses voters.""
""There is no excuse for any group, including ones run by people who claim to be part of our ‘coalition,’ to suggest they directly support President Trump’s re-election or any other candidates, when in fact their actions show they are interested in filling their own pockets with money from innocent Americans’ paychecks, and sadly, retirements,"" the statement said.
While the campaign did not mention any group by name, the comment came days after Axios and the Campaign Legal Center published a report about the Presidential Coalition, a group run by former Trump deputy campaign manager David Bossie.
The analysis found that the Presidential Coalition raised $18.5 million in 2017 and 2018 promoting the group as a stalwart ally of Trump. Just three percent of its spending went to direct political activities, while the lion's share of its spending went toward raising more money, while two organizations linked to Bossie received almost $660,000 from the group.
The Presidential Coalition is far from the first group to have such an unusual spending breakdown. But groups like these have long faced criticism over the years with critics accusing them of being primarily set up to funnel money to preferred vendors and to staff salaries instead of toward the direct political activity that donors may expect their money to fund.
The group denied any allegations of impropriety in a statement to Axios, arguing that the Campaign Legal Center was biased against it because of its work to tighten campaign finance laws and that its spending is necessary to support the group's mission.
""This is fake news brought to you by a collaboration of the biased liberal media and unabashed left-wing activists,"" the Coalition said in the statement to Axios.
Facebook Twitter Email Elena Moore 5 days ago The hurdles ahead for felony voting rights legislation WASHINGTON — In November of 2018, Floridians passed Amendment 4 – giving 1.4 million people with past felony convictions the right to vote. Last week, the state’s lawmakers passed legislation to require they pay various fines and fees before having those rights restored, a move that has been criticized as a “poll tax” by critics of the legislation. The bill now heads to the governor who has signalled his support but has not yet signed it.
Now, as similar policy debates occur across the country in state houses, Congress, and on the 2020 campaign trail, voting rights advocates face an uncertain future.
Supporters of felony re-enfranchisement legislation continue to stress the significant restrictions that long-term criminal justice and voting rights laws have had particularly on African Americans.
According to the Sentencing Project , a research and advocacy organization, 1 in 13 African American adults are disenfranchised for a past felony charge, compared to 1 in every 56 non-black adults.
Christopher Uggen, a criminologist and professor of sociology at the University of Minnesota reaffirms this. “The disproportionate impact on communities of color helps make it an urgent civil rights movement today.”
If the bill passed in Florida is implemented, the ACLU says that about 40 percent of enfranchised ex-felons in Florida would no longer be eligible to register due to the costs.
Also, according to Julie Ebenstein, the Senior Staff Attorney for the ACLU’s Voting Rights Project, Florida does not have a “centralized system that tracks people post-sentence.”
“That could really have a chilling effect,” Ebenstein added.
Felony disenfranchisement laws change from state to state and often governor to governor.
Today, only Iowa and Kentucky have lifetime disenfranchisement laws in place. Iowa recently tried to change their law — with the support of Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds — but the proposal failed to advance out of the state Senate.
Legislation to ease voting restrictions has also been proposed in Tennessee , Kentucky , Texas , Connecticut , New Jersey , Minnesota , and California .
Federal legislation was also recently introduced that would allow former felons to vote in federal elections.
And the 2020 Democratic candidates are also starting to take public stances on the issue.
For example, Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., has introduced The Next Step Act, a criminal justice bill that would allow people who were incarcerated to vote in federal elections.
And Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-VT., has also said he supports giving both current and formerly incarcerated felons the right to vote — a policy legal only in Vermont and Maine.
But Uggen said he expects candidates to pay more attention to the issue, especially since 82 percent of Democrats support it. “The question is how far they will go,” he said.
Facebook Twitter Email Ben Kamisar 5 days ago Progressive group launches ads hitting Michael Bennet on judicial nominations WASHINGTON — Demand Justice, a progressive group fighting President Donald Trump's judicial nominations, is elevating its battle with Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., over the issue with a new spate of advertisements targeting Bennet's presidential bid.
The group has been a regular critic of Bennet's, giving him an 'F' grade on its scorecard ranking lawmakers' ""willingness to fight Trump’s judges."" And now it's launching television and digital ads in the early-primary state of New Hampshire that accuse Bennet of ""helping"" Trump confirm judges.
""Bennet’s backed many of Trump’s extreme judges. He votes for them almost 70 percent of the time. Bennet even praised Neil Gorsuch when Trump picked him for the Supreme Court seat stolen from President Obama,"" the ad's narrator says.
""Now that Democrats are proposing ways to fix the court, Bennet is standing in the way of that, too. Hey, Michael Bennet — what gives? Helping Trump is not a good look.""
Demand Justice told NBC News that it's spending $10,000 on the digital ads and then ""five figures"" to air the ad on WMUR in Manchester, N.H.
The spot is meant to put pressure on Bennet, who announced his presidential bid last week, and amounts to one of the first Democrat-on-Democrat fights of the presidential cycle.
The Coloradan pushed back on Demand Justice's criticism during an interview with NBC's ""Meet the Press"" on Sunday, arguing that Democrats' ""non-strategic"" opposition to Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch prompted Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to change Senate rules to lower the threshold for advancing Supreme Court nominations, which put Democrats in an even worse spot.
""The people behind that Super PAC that are attacking me for an 'F,' they deserve an 'F,' because they helped conceive that strategy,"" Bennet said.
Bennet didn't join the Democratic filibuster of Gorsuch at the time, which put up a procedural hurdle to the nomination, but the senator ultimately voted against Gorsuch's confirmation.
UPDATE: This post was updated to include spending details on the ad buy.
Facebook Twitter Email Ben Kamisar 5 days ago Jill Biden addresses husband's apology to Anita Hill WASHINGTON — Jill Biden said Tuesday that her husband, former Vice President Joe Biden, was ""grateful"" that Anita Hill recently took his phone call amid her frustration with his handling of her decades-old accusations of sexual harassment against Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas.
The former vice president called Hill last month, shortly before announcing his presidential bid, but Hill told the New York Times she was not satisfied with his message.
Pressed on that exchange on NBC's ""Today,"" Jill Biden argued that the experience gave her husband perspective he used to promote women's issues in the Senate.

Facebook Twitter Email Vaughn Hillyard 6 days ago Kamala Harris: Electability debate 'leaves people out' WASHINGTON—Kamala Harris argued Sunday that the debate in the Democratic Party over which presidential candidate is most electable in the crucial Midwestern swing states is talking past minority voters across those states.
Speaking at a dinner for the Detroit branch of the NAACP, Harris argued the electability debate is sometimes too ‘simplistic.'”
“There has been a conversation by the pundits about electability and ‘who can speak to the Midwest? But when they say that, they usually put the Midwest in a simplistic box and a narrow narrative. And too often their definition of the Midwest leaves people out,” she said.
“It leaves out people in this room who helped build cities like Detroit. It leaves out working women who are on their feet all day--many of them working without equal pay. And the conversation too often suggests certain voters will only vote for certain candidates regardless of whether their ideas will lift up all our families.”

Facebook Twitter Email Ben Kamisar 6 days ago O'Rourke joins the calls for President Trump's impeachment WASHINGTON — Beto O'Rourke told the Dallas Morning News Sunday that he believes House Democrats should ""move forward with impeachment"" of President Trump.
The former Texas Democratic congressman and current presidential candidate had previously refrained from advocating for the idea of impeachment, arguing the decision should be left to the House in which he once served (as a congressman, O'Rourke voted against impeaching the president in a 2017 House vote ).
But in the interview published Sunday, O'Rourke argued in favor of impeachment as a way to hold Trump accountable.
""We're finally learning the truth about this president. And yes, there has to be consequences. Yes, there has to be accountability.Yes, I think there's enough evidence now for the House of Representatives to move forward with impeachment,” he said.
“This is our country, and this is the one chance that we get to ensure that it remains a democracy and that no man, regardless of his position, is above the law.”
The question of impeachment has divided Democrats in Congress, on the trail and at home.
Former Housing and Urban Development Sec. Julián Castro as well as Sens. Kamala Harris, D-Calif. and Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., have all called for Trump's impeachment outright.
Some, like South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., have argued that Trump has committed offenses worthy of impeachment but are stopping short of a direct call for impeachment. Others have balked at the idea, arguing that it would be best for Democrats to defeat Trump at the ballot box.
New data from the latest national NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll found Americans divided on the prospect of impeachment even as a majority said Trump was not honest and truthful related to the investigation into Russian interference with the 2016 election.
Facebook Twitter Email Ben Kamisar 6 days ago Biden tops presidential Facebook spending for second week in a row WASHINGTON — Former Vice President Joe Biden spent more than $315,000 on Facebook ads last week, making him the highest political spender on the platform for the second consecutive week.
Biden's presidential campaign has spent about $732,000 on Facebook ads since he jumped into the race less than two weeks ago, data from Facebook's Ad Library shows.
That's almost as much as some Democratic politicians have spent during their much-longer presidential bids so far, including Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., ($781,200), Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., (785,100) and Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., ($817,800).
Since his campaign is still in its infancy, most of Biden's ads have been fundraising or list-building appeals that focused on his announcement, a video ad citing former President Obama's praise of Biden, and warnings about President Trump's fundraising advantage over the Democratic field.
Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., narrowly trails Biden on this week's list of top Facebook spenders with $296,600 spent last week. Many of her ads highlighted her call for Attorney General William Barr to resign, while others included a video fundraising appeal from Harris.
President Trump's campaign spent the third most of presidential candidates last week with $120,300, followed by Warren's $97,700 and Washington Democratic Gov. Jay Inslee's $57,600.
Facebook Twitter Email Vaughn Hillyard 7 days ago Bernie Sanders introduces 'rebuild rural America' proposals OSAGE, Iowa — Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., unveiled a broad package of proposals on Sunday aimed at aiding rural communities, including the breaking up of major agriculture corporations and the transitioning of the U.S. commodity industry toward a system in which the government sets commodity production and pricing based on demand, much like Canada’s dairy industry, to guarantee farmers’ “cost of production and family living expenses.”
“This growing monopolization of agriculture is unfair to food producers. It is unfair to consumers. It is unfair to the environment,” the Democratic presidential candidate said from behind a podium at the Mitchell County fairgrounds, looking out onto about 100 Iowans seated in chairs or the set of risers under the pavilion. “Together, we are going to change that system.”
The Vermont senator’s package of proposals , which he touted as a ""radical policy change,"" signals the Democratic presidential candidate’s quest to win over the largely agricultural-focused voters who heavily favored President Trump’s candidacy in 2016.
The series of proposals lays out an aggressive effort to break up large agriculture corporations through “Roosevelt-style trust-busting laws.” Sanders proposed placing a moratorium on future mergers between large agribusinesses.
In perhaps his most significant proposal, Sanders laid out his desire to transition the U.S. commodity industry toward supply management programs in which the federal government would work with farmers to determine the amount of product needed from an operation to meet the demands of the marketplace while guaranteeing a price for the product that would ensure those farmers earn a “living wage.”
On trade, Sanders provided few details about his vision. He did not lay out his thoughts on President Trump’s continued use of tariffs, with is plan saying he plans to “develop fair trade partnerships that do not drive down the prices paid to food producers and that, instead, protect farmers here and abroad.”
His plan also proposes: Aiding beginning farmers with investments in land acquisition and equipment, reforming agricultural subsidies to move more financial support away from larger farming operations, opening up money resources for farmers to transition to more sustainable farming practices, ensuring a farmer has the right to repair his or her own machinery, reforming patent laws to “protect farmers from predatory patent lawsuits from companies like Monsanto” over seed patents and the strengthening of regulations on organic products.
Facebook Twitter Email Ben Kamisar 7 days ago Bennet to liberal critics of his judicial votes: 'They deserve an 'F'' WASHINGTON — Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., Sunday pushed back at progressives questioning his handling of judicial votes during the Trump administration, blasting those critics for lacking ""discipline.""
The debate boils down (in part) to Bennet's decision not to join the Democratic filibuster of Justice Neil Gorsuch, a failed attempt to block the nominee from receiving a confirmation vote.
While a critical mass of Democrats kept Gorsuch short of the 60-vote threshold that was needed at the time to advance his nomination, the stalemate in the Senate prompted Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to evoke the ""nuclear option"" and remove that 60-vote threshold.
Progressives, including the ""Demand Justice"" group that's trying to rally liberal opposition to Trump's judicial picks, have blasted Bennet for not joining the filibuster, painting him as acquiescing to Trump's nominees . Demand Justice's annual scorecard grades Bennet an 'F' on his "" willingness to fight Trump's judges .""
But the Colorado Democrat took issue with that grade during a Sunday interview on NBC's ""Meet the Press.""
He argued that progressives erred by goading McConnell into scrapping the nuclear option over Gorsuch, who was nominated to replace the conservative-leaning Justice Antonin Scalia after his death.
Instead, he argued, Democrats should have waited to elevate the fight until the retirement of former Justice Anthony Kennedy, when the ideological balance of the court was at stake.
""Unlike Mitch McConnell, we didn't have the discipline to play it strategically. We were non-strategic and as a result, when Kavanaugh got there, Democrats could do nothing except pretend to our base that we were fighting,"" Bennet said.
""Those who conceived of this strategy continue to advocate it and continue to attack other Democrats who disagree with them. I think they deserve an 'F.'""

Facebook Twitter Email Garrett Haake and Kailani Koenig 9 days ago How a rural Texas county illustrate's Beto's go-anywhere strategy GUTHRIE, Texas — At town hall events across the country, Beto O’Rourke regularly highlights his experience in King County, Texas — a community with just over 200 registered voters; fewer people than often attend his presidential campaign events.
Earlier this month, the former Texas congressman joked to a crowd in Storm Lake, Iowa that the county 90 miles east of Lubbock is so red you can see it glowing from space, but during his 2018 senate bid, he went there anyway. Those people, he says, deserved to be heard.
""We’re just hard working people that believe in working hard, putting in a day’s work, getting our paychecks, take care of our families, and our beliefs, and raising our kids,” explained Jessie Hatfield, a cowboy on the 6666 cattle ranch, the major private employer in the county.
O’Rourke's December 2017 visit to Guthrie, the seat of King County may have helped him improve upon Hillary Clinton’s performance here. She got five votes in 2016. O’Rourke got six in 2018.
""You just gotta actually come here and talk to us,” explained Ashley Branch, chair of the King County Democrats, and one of those six voters. ""And not just us but other little communities. Our closest grocery story is 90 miles so there’s a lot of other little communities around us who are willing to listen if you’ll listen to us.""
O’Rourke has modeled much of his presidential campaign on the same “go-everywhere” strategy: visiting all 10 counties in New Hampshire on his first trip to the state, launching his campaign in far-flung Keokuk, Iowa, and holding a town hall in tiny Denmark, South Carolina.
But while such visits to low-density areas might make for good anecdotal fodder, many political analysts see trips like these as a waste of a campaign’s most valuable resource: a candidate’s time.
“It tells you that in terms of cost benefit analysis it’s a waste of time,” said Seth McKee, a southern politics professor at Texas Tech University. ""It doesn't pick him up any votes. But he's making the overture, which is a lot more than can be said for most modern campaign strategies for the major parties.”
Facebook Twitter Email Vaughn Hillyard 9 days ago Inslee lays out '100 percent' clean energy plan LOS ANGELES — Democratic presidential candidate Jay Inslee proposed a clean energy plan on Friday to move the United States toward an eventual 100% clean energy standard for electricity generation, new vehicles and buildings “no later than 2045.”
“We’re laying out a plan that is, both, necessary, according to the science, and productive, according to the economics,” Inslee told NBC News ahead of his formal announcement at a Los Angeles bus depot featuring new electric buses and charging stations.
The Washington governor said his plan, and history in public office, separates him from the other 20 Democratic candidates in the presidential field. “This is a vision I’ve had for 15 years now,"" he said, ""so the candidates putting out plans are about 12 years behind. I welcome them to join me on this. I think it’s a good thing that they’re following me on this. But we need to realize there’s a different level of commitment and success.”
Inslee’s “100% Clean Energy for America Plan” outlines a set of benchmarks to be achieved through a mix of presidential executive actions and legislation through Congress. The Washington governor’s proposal calls for utilities to turn exclusively to clean, renewable and zero-emission energy for electricity by 2035.
The governor’s plan would seek to end of coal-fired power plant operations by 2030 while vowing to ensure transitions for those employed in the industry into other “good-paying jobs.”
The comprehensive plan would also require zero emissions for new passenger vehicles, medium-duty trucks and busses, as well as implement a national “zero-carbon building standard” to cancel out carbon pollution from new commercial and residential buildings by 2030.
The Washington governor signed a similar state-level bill into law in April, a move that would require utility companies in the state to no longer use coal power by 2025 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2030.
Inslee announced his presidential bid two months ago and has almost exclusively focused his time on the campaign trail to touring and highlighting the work of renewable energy industries as well as holding meetings with climate and Democratic activists. His team has called it a “climate-focused campaign.”
Facebook Twitter Email Josh Lederman and Monica Alba 11 days ago Pete Buttigieg met with Hillary Clinton this week WASHINGTON — South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg met with 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton this week in New York, sources confirm to NBC News.
A Buttigieg spokesman says the meeting took place Monday while Buttigieg was in New York for lunch with Al Sharpton and taping of The Daily Show. A Clinton aide also confirmed that they met, though neither side had an official statement about the meeting.
It's unclear what was discussed during the Monday meeting.
But earlier this year, Buttigieg upset some Clinton loyalists when he told The Washington Post in an January interview that President Trump defeated Clinton because ""at least he didn’t go around saying that America was already great, like Hillary did.”
Longtime Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill called that criticism ""indefensible"" a few months later on Twitter , arguing that Clinton ""ran on a belief in this country & the most progressive platform in modern political history.""
Buttigieg responded to the back-and-forth by telling the South Bend CBS affiliate that he has ""enormous respect for Sec. Clinton"" and that she was ""ill-served by a strategy and a media environment which made things much more about the individuals, much more about all the problems with Donald Trump and less about the concerns of voters.""

Fordham University student dies after falling from campus clock tower,www.nbcnews.com,,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/fordham-university-student-dies-after-falling-campus-clock-tower-n994376,"A student at Fordham University in the Bronx died Sunday after falling from a campus clock tower , school officials said. Sydney Monfries, 22, had been climbing the tower at Keating Hall with other students at roughly 3 a.m. when she plunged 30 feet to the ground, authorities and school officials said.
Monfries later died at a hospital, the university said Sunday in a note to students.
Sydney Monfries Facebook The New York Police Department said it appeared she and other students were climbing a set of stairs when she fell through a hole in a landing, NBC New York reported .
The school said there will be ""no disciplinary action"" against the students who were with Monfries when she fell.
Emergency responders found Monfries on the ground with trauma to her head and neck, according to the station.
In a letter to students, the university's president, Joseph M. McShane, said Monfries was weeks from graduating with her bachelor’s degree.
“There are no words sufficient to describe the loss of someone so young and full of promise,” he said, adding that Fordham would issue her degree posthumously.
According to Monfries’ Facebook profile, she was a photo editor at InStyle and a former news intern at KGW, an NBC affiliate in Portland, Oregon.
The university said it is investigating how and when the students gained access to the tower, which is locked at night.
""In the past, authorized university officials have sometimes given tours of the tower, in part to satisfy students’ curiosity about it, and reduce the likelihood that they would attempt to enter the structure without authorization,"" the university said in a statement.
In 2013, a school official told the Fordham Ram that the tower was “rather dangerous” and therefore “off limits” to students. The university said Monday that there have been no previous falls from Keating Tower.

Shortly after the suspect was taken into custody by police, he was identified by law enforcement officials as Robert Bowers, 46, a resident of the Pittsburgh area. Various social media accounts in his name appear to show a history of anti-Semitic messages and hate speech.

Experts say more than 800 tons of melted fuel remains in Fukushima's three reactors. Kyodo / AP file Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. SUBSCRIBE April 15, 2019, 8:09 AM GMT By Associated Press TOKYO — The operator of the tsunami-wrecked Fukushima nuclear plant has begun removing fuel from a cooling pool at one of three reactors that melted down in the 2011 disaster, a milestone in the decades-long process to decommission the plant. Tokyo Electric Power Co. said Monday that workers started removing the first of 566 used and unused fuel units stored in the pool at Unit 3. The fuel units in the pool located high up in reactor buildings are intact despite the disaster, but the pools are not enclosed, so removing the units to safer ground is crucial to avoid disaster in case of another major quake. TEPCO says the removal at Unit 3 would take two years, followed by the two other reactors where about 1,000 fuel units remain in the storage pools. Removing fuel units from the cooling pools comes ahead of the real challenge of removing melted fuel from inside the reactors, but details of how that might be done are still largely unknown. Removing the fuel in the cooling pools was delayed more than four years by mishaps, high radiation and radioactive debris from an explosion that occurred at the time of the reactor meltdown, underscoring the difficulties that remain. Workers are remotely operating a crane built underneath a jelly roll-shaped roof cover to raise the fuel from a storage rack in the pool and place it into a protective cask. The whole process occurs underwater to prevent radiation leaks. Each cask will be filled with seven fuel units, then lifted from the pool and lowered to a truck that will transport the cask to a safer cooling pool elsewhere at the plant. The work is carried out remotely from a control room about 500 yards away because of still-high radiation levels inside the reactor building that houses the pool. Radioactive Boars Hunted After Taking Over Towns Near Fukushima March 10, 2017 01:03 About an hour after the work began Monday, the first fuel unit was safely stored inside the cask, TEPCO said. ""I believe everything is going well so far,"" plant chief Tomohiko Isogai told Japan's NHK television from Fukushima. ""We will watch the progress at the site as we put safety first. Our goal is not to rush the process but to carefully proceed with the decommissioning work."" In 2014, TEPCO safely removed all 1,535 fuel units from the storage pool at a fourth reactor that was idle and had no fuel inside its core when the March 11, 2011, earthquake and tsunami occurred. Robotic probes have photographed and detected traces of damaged nuclear fuel in the three reactors that had meltdowns, but the exact location and other details of the melted fuel are largely unknown. Removing fuel from the cooling pools will help free up space for the subsequent removal of the melted fuel, though details of how to gain access to it are yet to be decided. April 13, 2015 00:40 Experts say the melted fuel in the three reactors amounts to more than 800 tons. In February, a remote-controlled robot with tongs removed pebbles of nuclear debris from the Unit 2 reactor but was unable to remove larger chunks, indicating a robot would need to be developed that can break the chunks into smaller pieces. Toshiba Corp.'s energy systems unit, which developed the robot, said the findings were key to determining the proper equipment and technologies needed to remove the melted fuel, the most challenging part of the decommissioning expected to take decades. TEPCO and government officials plan to determine methods for removing the melted fuel from each of the three damaged reactors later this year so they can begin the process in 2021.

Red Cross reveals nurse Louisa Akavi has been held in Syria since 2013,www.nbcnews.com,,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/red-cross-reveals-nurse-louisa-akavi-has-been-held-syria-n994416,"WELLINGTON, New Zealand — New Zealand's foreign minister confirmed Monday that a nurse has been held captive by the Islamic State group in Syria for almost six years, information long kept secret for fear her life might be at risk. The status of nurse and midwife Louisa Akavi, now 62, is unknown, but her employer, the International Committee of the Red Cross, says it has received recent eyewitness reports suggesting she might be alive.
The New York Times on Sunday became the first media organization to name Akavi, ending a more than 5 ½-year news blackout imposed by New Zealand's government and the Red Cross with the cooperation of international media.
The collapse of the Islamic State group has raised hopes that Akavi and the two Syrian drivers kidnapped with her might now be discovered.
U.S.-backed forces declare victory over ISIS in Syria after last stronghold falls March 23, 2019 01:53 In a statement, the ICRC said that as recently as December, Akavi may have been seen by at lest two people at a clinic in Sousa, one of the Islamic State group's last outposts. There were also reported sightings in 2016 and 2017, Red Cross officials said.
""We continue to work together (with the Red Cross) to locate and recover her,"" New Zealand Foreign Minister Winston Peters said. ""This has been a uniquely complex and difficult case. Louisa went to Syria with the ICRC to deliver humanitarian relief to people suffering as a result of a brutal civil war and ISIS occupation.""
Peters said New Zealand had sent a small multi-agency team, including special forces, to Iraq to gather information on Akavi.
Related World news Life under ISIS led these Muslims to Christianity Akavi was taken captive in 2013 in the city of Idlib in northwest Syria. It is believed she was offered for ransom and may have been used as a human shield. New Zealand's government believed at one point that she may have died. But there are hopes her medical skills might have caused her captors to spare her.
Akavi's family said they miss her and are proud of the work to which she's dedicated her life.
""We think about her every day and hope she feels that and finds strength in that,"" said a video statement issued by family spokesman Tuaine Robati. ""We know she is thinking of us and that she will be worried about us too.""
Dominik Stillhart, director of operations for the ICRC, said the organization had decided to permit publication in the hope it would elicit new information on her whereabouts.
""We have not spoken publicly before today because from the moment Louisa and the others were kidnapped, every decision we made was to maximize the chances of winning their freedom,"" Stillhart said in a statement. ""With Islamic State group having lost the last of its territory, we felt it was now time to speak out.""
He said the collapse of the Islamic State group in Syria may mean new opportunities to learn more about Akavi's situation and the ICRC also feared it risked losing track of her in the aftermath of ISIS' collapse.

"In the Trump era, evangelicals take center stage on Israel policy",www.nbcnews.com,Jonathan Allen,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/trump-era-evangelicals-take-center-stage-israel-policy-n994326,"WASHINGTON — In a few weeks, the Rev. John Hagee will enter the heavily guarded gates of the Israeli Embassy here to address a ""solidarity"" gathering of Jews and Christians, according to an invitation obtained by NBC News. Hagee, one of the most influential and controversial evangelical Christian leaders in the United States and the head of Christians United for Israel, said in February that Israel was just days or weeks away from major armed conflict with its Muslim neighbors and that it would win the first in ""a series of wars that end in the coming of Messiah.""
The place of honor he is being afforded at the Israeli Embassy, as the keynote speaker for the May 3 event, is the latest sign of the degree to which white evangelical Christians are the growing power in their long-standing political partnership with American and Israeli Jews.
Israeli PM Netanyahu poised for new term after Trump boost April 10, 2019 05:27 It wasn't long ago — 2008 — that GOP presidential nominee John McCain was forced to reject Hagee's endorsement because Hagee had delivered a sermon suggesting the Holocaust was part of God's plan for Jews to return to Israel as a catalyst for the Biblical end times.
Times change and white evangelical Christians are proving a more reliable partner both for Republican President Donald Trump and for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu than American Jews, who largely vote Democratic and who are deeply fractured over Israel's policies.
That is, Trump may be for Israel, but evidence suggests his support has little to do with Jews and everything to do with pleasing the white evangelical Christians who form the strongest core of his base heading into the 2020 election.
His most visible moves on Israel policy — relocating the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem, and recognizing Israel's claim to the contested Golan Heights region in the runup to Israeli elections last week — are crowd-pleasers with evangelical voters who believe that Jews must have full control of Jerusalem for the return of the Messiah and the beginning of the end times.
That's the foundation for the strange-bedfellows relationship between pro-Israel American Jews and white evangelical Christians: Many Jews have accepted the support of Christians for Israel because they don't believe in the New Testament prophesy, and many Christian Zionists are happy to find common cause with Jews for now in order to help bring about Armageddon.
But Netanyahu and Trump have simultaneously thrilled Christian Zionists and put stress on Jews by abandoning a ""two-state solution"" to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that envisioned side-by-side nations and going all-in on Israeli expansion.
Related World news World news Benjamin Netanyahu's re-election may doom the two-state solution Trump began signaling his direction early in his presidency by following through on a promise to move the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem, which eliminated a negotiating point in Israeli-Palestinian talks.
Hagee, who apologized for the Hitler comments in 2008, delivered a benediction prayer at the dedication ceremony.
""Moving the embassy to Jerusalem was not for Jews. That was not for us ... That was a statement for Christians,"" Danya Ruttenberg, a Chicago-area rabbi and author said in a telephone interview with NBC News. ""The Christian Zionist interest in annexation [and] occupation is driven by an ideological interest in driving the end times into being.""
Trump acknowledged the domestic political effect in an interview with Mike Huckabee on the Christian Broadcast Network last year.
""You know who really likes it the most is the evangelicals,” Trump said. “I’ll tell you what, I get more calls of ‘thank you’ from evangelicals, and I see it in the audiences and everything else, than I do from Jewish people. And the Jewish people appreciate it, but the evangelicals appreciate it more than the Jews, which is incredible.”
Related World news World news Holy Land Christians feel abandoned by U.S. evangelicals While critics of Israel and its policies — including Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., who has elicited condemnation from Trump and many Democrats for her commentary — tend to focus on the perceived power of the so-called 'Israel lobby' as represented by groups like AIPAC, Christian Zionists like Hagee and his followers exercise tremendous influence in Washington.
""We’re not another paper-shuffling, hand-clapping group of Christians who get struck up on joy once a year and go home and forget it,"" Hagee said in a recent interview available on YouTube. ""We are 4.5 million people who are organized in every state, every city, every voting district.""
He took credit for a 2011 lobbying campaign to get Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., to abandon a proposal to eliminate foreign aid, including money for Israel, from the federal budget.
""We put 35,000 emails in his office ... he yanked that bill down,"" Hagee said. ""We are doing that over and over and over.""
The hand of the Christian Zionists has become increasingly visible because of Trump's reliance on their community and his periodic candor, according to people who study the issue closely.
""The end goal isn’t what’s good for the Jewish community, the end goal is what’s good for the second coming of Christ,"" said Robert P. Jones, CEO of the Public Religion Research Institute. ""If you’re purely thinking from a tactical point of view, you’ve got a bigger group in white evangelicals, and you’ve got a group that as a whole has a theological orientation that thinks that this is an important thing for their theological worldview.""
Jones notes that in a survey of the American Jewish community taken before the 2012 presidential election, PRRI found that 45 percent said support for social equality was most important to their Jewish identity while only 20 percent named Israel, and that only 4 percent said Israel was their top consideration in deciding how to vote in that year's election, compared to 51 percent who said jobs or the economy and 15 percent who said the growing gap between the rich and the poor.
In 2016, according to exit polls, 23 percent of Jewish voters picked Trump, while 80 percent of white evangelical Christians sided with him over Hillary Clinton. Jews made up 3 percent of the electorate, compared with 26 percent for white evangelical Christians. In the 2018 midterms, Jewish voters accounted for 2 percent of the electorate, and only 17 percent of them voted for Republicans.
Trump accuses Democrats of allowing anti-Semitism to take root in Vegas speech April 6, 2019 01:59 Trump is trying to turn that around.
He and his allies have focused on Omar, the freshman representative who has received broad condemnation for a series of remarks that were widely viewed as anti-Semitic. She apologized ""unequivocally"" for tweeting that U.S. support for Israel is ""all about the Benjamins"" — a suggestion that pro-Israel donors were using financial influence to drive American foreign policy — and later wondered why ""it is OK for people to push for allegiance to a foreign country,"" which appeared to raise the trope of dual loyalty for Israel and America among U.S. Jews.
His critics point to other remarks — the time Trump told Jewish Republicans they wouldn't support him because ""I don't want your money,"" or when he said there were ""fine people on both sides"" of a Charlottesville, Virginia, rally at which white nationalists chanted ""Jews will not replace us.""
He has repeatedly said that Democrats are ""anti-Jewish"" and ""anti-Israel,"" he has proclaimed the arrival of a ""Jexodus"" — an odd portmanteau for a Jewish exodus from the Democratic Party given that the original Exodus pertained to Jews — and he seems to believe that American Jews who want Israel to remain both a Jewish state and a democracy will be drawn to his efforts to reduce immigration to the U.S.
He went so far as to say ""we're full"" in a recent speech to the Republican Jewish Coalition in Las Vegas on the heels of a trip he'd made to the U.S. border with Mexico.
Related World news World news A former ultra-Orthodox settler is now battling for Palestinian rights Trump received a little bit of applause from the RJC audience — and condemnation from Jews outside the room.
While American Jews tend to vote on domestic issues, few matters are more divisive within their circles than Israel's borders.
""Occupation has fractured the Jewish community in a lot of ways,"" Ruttenberg said. ""We’re definitely not monolithic about it.""
But there's much more clarity when it comes to where Trump stands to benefit from pushing a hawkish line on Israel — and it's not with Jewish voters.
""The political or tactical payout is much more likely to come from — if you’re thinking about votes — from the evangelical community than it is from the Jewish community,"" Jones said.

Omar says more death threats coming since Trump 9/11 video,www.nbcnews.com,Associated Press,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/omar-says-more-death-threats-coming-trump-9-11-video-n994466,"WASHINGTON — Rep. Ilhan Omar says she's faced increased death threats since President Donald Trump spread around a video that purports to show her being dismissive of the 2001 terrorist attacks. ""This is endangering lives,"" she said, accusing Trump of fomenting right-wing extremism. ""It has to stop."" Her statement late Sunday followed an announcement by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that she has taken steps to ensure the safety of the Minnesota Democrat and the speaker's call for Trump to take down the video.
Soon after Pelosi's statement, the video disappeared as a pinned tweet at the top of Trump's Twitter feed, but it was not deleted.
Rep. Ilhan Omar getting death threats after President Trump's 9/11 tweet April 15, 2019 02:05 Pelosi was among Democrats who had criticized Trump over the tweet, with some accusing him of trying to incite violence against the Muslim lawmaker. An upstate New York man recently was charged with making death threats against her.
On Monday, Trump took a shot at Pelosi for defending Omar.
Before Nancy, who has lost all control of Congress and is getting nothing done, decides to defend her leader, Rep. Omar, she should look at the anti-Semitic, anti-Israel and ungrateful U.S. HATE statements Omar has made. She is out of control, except for her control of Nancy!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 15, 2019 White House press secretary Sarah Sanders defended Trump Sunday, saying the president has a duty to highlight Omar's history of making comments that others deem anti-Semitic or otherwise offensive and that he wished no ""ill will"" upon the first-term lawmaker.
But Omar said that since Trump retweeted the video Friday night, she's received many threats on her life that referred or replied to the posted video.
""Violent crimes and other acts of hate by right-wing extremists and white nationalists are on the rise in this country and around the world,"" she said. ""We can no longer ignore that they are being encouraged by the occupant of the highest office in the land."" She said: ""We are all Americans.""
Earlier, Pelosi issued a statement while traveling in London saying she had spoken with congressional authorities ""to ensure that Capitol Police are conducting a security assessment to safeguard Congresswoman Omar, her family and her staff.""
Pelosi said officials will continue to monitor and assess threats against Omar, and called on Trump to discourage such behavior.
""The President's words weigh a ton, and his hateful and inflammatory rhetoric creates real danger,"" Pelosi said. ""President Trump must take down his disrespectful and dangerous video.""
The video in Trump's tweet included a snippet from a recent speech Omar gave to the Council on American-Islamic Relations, in which she described the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attack on the World Trade Center as ""some people did something,"" along with news footage of the hijacked airplanes hitting the Twin Towers. Trump captioned his tweet with: ""WE WILL NEVER FORGET!""
Critics accuse Omar of being flippant in describing the perpetrators of the attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people. She later sought to defend herself by tweeting a Quote: from President George W. Bush, in which the Republican president referred to the attackers as ""people"" just days after 9/11.
Neither Trump's tweet nor the video included Omar's full Quote: or the context of her comments, which were about Muslims feeling that their civil liberties had eroded after the attacks. The tweet was posted atop Trump's Twitter feed for much of Sunday, with more than 9 million views. It remained lower in the feed after Pelosi requested that the video be pulled.
Sanders questioned why Democrats weren't following Trump's example and calling out Omar, too. Democrats who criticized the president over the tweet defended Omar, with some noting their past disagreements with her.
""Certainly the president is wishing no ill will and certainly not violence towards anyone, but the president is absolutely and should be calling out the congresswoman for her — not only one time — but history of anti-Semitic comments,"" Sanders said. ""The bigger question is why aren't Democrats doing the same thing? It's absolutely abhorrent the comments that she continues to make and has made and they look the other way.""
Omar repeatedly has pushed fellow Democrats into uncomfortable territory with comments about Israel and the strength of the Jewish state's influence in Washington. She apologized for suggesting that lawmakers support Israel for pay and said she isn't criticizing Jews. But she refused to take back a tweet in which she suggested American supporters of Israel ""pledge allegiance"" to a foreign country.
Rep. Jerry Nadler, a New York Democrat who represents Manhattan's financial district, which was targeted on 9/11, said he had no issues with Omar's characterization of the attack.
""I have had some problems with some of her other remarks, but not — but not with that one,"" he said.
Sanders commented on ""Fox News Sunday"" and ABC's ""This Week."" Nadler appeared on CNN's ""State of the Union.

Amazon is trying to soften its image as regulatory scrutiny of tech giants grows,www.nbcnews.com,"Eugene Kim, CNBC",04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/amazon-trying-soften-its-image-regulatory-scrutiny-tech-giants-grows-n994451,"Amazon’s relentless pursuit of growth in retail, cloud computing, advertising and consumer devices has put the company squarely in the sights of Washington lawmakers who are concerned about Big Tech’s growing influence over consumers. But rather than fiercely fighting every battle, Amazon looks like its ready to play nice. In March, Amazon dropped a policy that prevented merchants from offering lower prices on other websites following an investigation request by Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn. Last month, the company scaled back some of its most aggressive promotion tactics after Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., called out abusive business practices. And late last year Amazon raised its minimum wage to $15 following criticism of the company’s working conditions by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.
Amazon also confirmed to CNBC that it would soon start accepting cash at the Amazon Go cashierless stores as a growing number of cities and states push for laws that require all stores to serve the unbanked. It’s all part of a strategy to be more likable at a time when tech companies are drawing heat for behavior that looks increasingly anti-competitive.
“I believe Amazon has made the connection between likability and immunity from regulation,” said NYU business professor Scott Galloway, author of “The Four: The Hidden DNA of Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google.”
This is a different company from the vigorously defensive, win-at-all-cost Amazon we’re used to seeing.
Last year, for example, Amazon successfully fought a proposed law in Seattle that would have taxed the city’s largest businesses to address homeless issues. In 2011, Amazon was slapped with a $269 million tax bill in Texas and then threatened to shut down a warehouse there before reaching a settlement . And TechCrunch reported in August about a small army of apparent employees on Twitter who do nothing but promote how great it is to work in the company’s warehouses.
Galloway, an outspoken critic of Amazon, said the company’s effort to soften its image is its way of telling regulators, “Don’t break us up.” Galloway has argued that, for the sake of competition, Amazon needs to be split up.
Politicians from both sides of the aisle have been making the same case not only for Amazon, but Google and Facebook as well, while regulators in Europe have also stepped up their scrutiny over the industry. President Trump, who’s been going after Amazon and CEO Jeff Bezos since his campaign, told Axios that his administration is looking into antitrust violations by the company.
‘Poster child’ of the industry’s problems Aware of what’s coming, Amazon is taking “preemptive action,” said Kartik Hosanagar, a business professor at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Business. Even if presidential candidates like Warren and Sanders don’t get elected, their campaigns could have a huge impact on public sentiment and influence future regulation.
“This is a good strategy by Amazon to address these comments early before one of the candidates makes Amazon the poster child of what they refer to as the problems with Big Tech,” Hosanagar said.
An Amazon representative declined to comment.
Bezos’s annual shareholder letter this week may have reflected some of the company’s concerns. Unlike past letters that mostly focused on management principles and long-term thinking, Bezos chose to highlight how much Amazon is investing in helping other businesses grow, while reminding investors that the company accounts for only a small piece of the total retail market.
He’s well aware of the perils of being too closely allied with his peers in Silicon Valley, and stressed in an internal all-hands meeting last year the importance of telling a distinguished story so that Amazon doesn’t get “bundled together” with them.
“Facebook is not the same as Google , and Apple is not the same as Amazon, ” Bezos said at the meeting. “I don’t want to fight this kind of big tech impression — I want to just talk about Amazon.”
Erik Gordon, a business professor at the University of Michigan, said Amazon’s softer image could help, not just with regulators, but also for recruiting, retention and even keeping a certain group of investors happy. The negative response among many New Yorkers to the company’s HQ2 plans, which were ultimately scuttled, shows that the brand isn’t as beloved as it once was.
“Amazon has pretty much been in victory lap mode for a long time,” Gordon said. “But there seems to be a big shift in the mood and, as a whole, it’s in a more defensive mode.”

Former Volkswagen chief executive Martin Winterkorn leaves after testifying to a German parliamentary committee on the carmaker's emissions scandal in Berlin, Germany, Jan. 19, 2017. Hannibal Hanschke / Reuters file Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. SUBSCRIBE April 15, 2019, 12:37 PM GMT By Reuters FRANKFURT — Prosecutors in the German city of Braunschweig said on Monday they were pressing criminal charges against former Volkswagen Chief Executive Martin Winterkorn in connection with the carmaker's manipulation of diesel emissions testing. Four other executives are being charged, the prosecutors office said in a statement, without giving their names. VW was caught using illegal engine control software to cheat U.S. pollution tests in 2015, triggering a global backlash against diesel that and has so far cost it $32.8 billion. Prosecutors said Winterkorn was accused of a particularly serious case of fraud, breach of trust and breaching competition laws because he had not acted — despite having a special responsibility to do so as the company's CEO — after it became clear on May 25, 2014, that diesel engines had been manipulated. He neglected to inform authorities in Europe and the United States as well as customers of the illegal software and he also did not prevent the continued installation of such software, the prosecutors said. They added that this had resulted in Volkswagen being slapped with much higher fines in Germany and the United States than would have been the case had he acted. VW said it would not comment because the company was not a party to the proceedings. About a year ago, the United States filed criminal charges against Winterkorn, accusing him of conspiring to cover up the German automaker's diesel emissions cheating. Winterkorn remains in Germany, which does not typically extradite its citizens for prosecution in U.S. courts. In a related case, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Winterkorn last month, saying U.S. investors were informed too late about the German automaker's diesel emissions scandal, alleging a ""massive fraud"". The Braunschweig prosecutors said people accused of particularly serious fraud could face up to ten years in prison in Germany. They said investigations into another 36 suspects in the diesel emissions scandal were ongoing and it was unclear when they would be wrapped up."
Democratic candidates may find it hard to 'change the channel' from Trump,www.nbcnews.com,Chuck Todd,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/meet-the-press/democratic-candidates-may-find-it-hard-change-channel-trump-n994471,"WASHINGTON — Over the weekend, the Democratic 2020 candidates again faced a familiar dichotomy as they tried to stand out in a crowded field: Pitching proactive messages of unity and optimism, while being reactive to the latest instance of President Trump elevating a particularly polarizing topic — in this case, Rep. Ilhan Omar’s comments about 9/11. The three candidates who had campaign kickoff events in their hometowns over the weekend — Cory Booker, Pete Buttigieg and Eric Swalwell — each pitched themselves as the optimistic antidote to the current president.
Booker, in Newark on Saturday, on social justice and “love ”: “Newark, Brick City, taught me about that love. It’s not feel-good, easy-going love. It’s a strong, courageous love. The kind of love that serves, the kind of love that sacrifices. The kind of love that is essential to achieving justice.” Swalwell, in California on Sunday, on the nation’s “promise” : “As someone who has benefited so profoundly from the promise of America, as someone who owes this country, this city everything, I’m asking you to help me create a country that fulfills that promise for all Americans.” Buttigieg, in South Bend on Sunday, on “changing the channel” from the Trump era: “The horror show in Washington is mesmerizing, all-consuming. But starting today, we are going to change the channel. Sometimes a dark moment brings out the best in us, what is good in us, dare I say, what is great in us.” That Buttigieg line about “changing the channel” sure sounds like an appealing one for the six-in-ten voters who express discomfort with Trump’s 2020 reelection bid.
But it won’t be easy to play on anyone’s turf but Trump’s. Just think about the other political news story that dominated the weekend: Democrats responding to Trump’s Friday tweet linking Rep. Ilhan Omar and the 9/11 attacks.
Here’s how some of the 2020 candidates responded:
Bernie Sanders : “Ilhan Omar is a leader with strength and courage. She won't back down to Trump's racism and hate, and neither will we. The disgusting and dangerous attacks against her must end.” Beto O’Rourke: “This is an incitement to violence against Congresswoman Omar, against our fellow Americans who happen to be Muslim.” Elizabeth Warren : “The President is inciting violence against a sitting Congresswoman—and an entire group of Americans based on their religion.” Pete Buttigieg: “Now, a president uses that dark day to incite his base against a member of Congress, as if for sport. As if we learned nothing that day about the workings of hate.” Kamala Harris : “For two years, this President has used the most powerful platform in the world to sow hate & division. He's done it again. Putting the safety of a sitting member of Congress @IlhanMN at risk & vilifying a whole religion is beyond the pale.” Diving into a controversy involving a prominent Muslim isn’t an unusual move for Trump ; after all, he proposed a ban on Muslims entering the country, claimed to have seen “thousands” of Muslims cheering the 9/11 attacks, and posited that “Islam hates us.”
(And if you were wondering just how invested the White House is in talking about Omar, check out how Kellyanne Conway referenced her twice during an unrelated conversation about immigration policy with one of us on Sunday.)
But here’s our question: With a huge field of Democratic candidates seeking a breakout moment, what’s most effective? A change of channel and a return to normalcy? Or taking the fight to Trump, wherever he dictates it will be?
Trump campaign raises $30 million in first quarter Speaking of Trump and 2020, we learned yesterday that the president’s reelection campaign raised $30 million in the first three months of the year and has more than $40 million cash on hand.
More, from NBC’s Monica Alba: “Combined with $46 million raised by the Republican National Committee, the full Trump re-election effort is expected to have a grand total of $82 million in the bank, with the campaign doubling what it had at the end of last year… Trump’s entire 2016 campaign brought in $333 million. At this pace, their second attempt will easily outraise that. Campaign manager Brad Parscale believes they may spend $1 billion this time around, which would be three times more than what it cost last cycle.”
Here’s how that $30 million Trump campaign haul compares to what we know so far from the 2020 Democrats ahead of today’s FEC deadline.
Total raised
Bernie Sanders: $18.2 million in 41 days Kamala Harris: $12 million in 70 days Beto O’Rourke: $9.4 million in 18 days Pete Buttigieg: $7 million in 68 days Elizabeth Warren: $6 million in 90 days Amy Klobuchar: $5.2 million in 50 days Cory Booker: $5 million-plus in 59 days Kirsten Gillibrand: $3 million in 76 days John Delaney: $12.1 million in 90 days* (but that includes a loan of $11.7 million from his own pocket. More on that below.) That means that Democratic campaigns have raised a total of about $66 million in the first quarter, not counting Delaney’s self-funding.
As we wrote last week , Democratic fundraising has changed significantly over the last 12 years, with a new focus on small donors that’s yielding — for now — far more individual donors but less money overall for campaigns.
But don’t be surprised if that combined Trump/RNC number prompts hand-wringing from some Democratic strategists worried about building a war chest to compete with a GOP that’s still largely doing fundraising the old-fashioned way.
The Lid: Donor Dash Don’t miss the pod from Friday, when we looked at how Democrats have pivoted away from the big bundler model of fundraising since the beginning of the Obama era.
2020 VISION: It’s FEC deadline day! We already know a lot about the Democratic fundraising picture based on information the campaigns have individually released, but today, we get the receipts.
With campaigns due to submit their paperwork to the FEC by day’s end, we’ll be able to answer more questions about the money that candidates are raising — and spending.
Some of the questions we still have:
Who’s spending the most? Does anyone else come close to Elizabeth Warren’s more-than-85-percent burn rate ? Who has the most paid staff? Are there any surprises among the second- and third- tier candidates? What about the candidates we haven’t heard from at all yet? Who has the most donors who have already maxed out to the campaign? What did day-by-day fundraising look like for candidates who had breakout moments, like Pete Buttigieg and his $7 million haul? On the campaign trail today: Beto O’Rourke stumps in North Carolina… Bernie Sanders has an event with nurses in Pennsylvania and does a Fox News town hall that airs at 6:30pm ET… Elizabeth Warren and Jay Inslee are both in South Carolina… Cory Booker and Julian Castro are in Iowa… Eric Swalwell has a town hall in Nevada… and Howard Schultz has three events in Arizona.

— Vaughn Hillyard (@VaughnHillyard) April 14, 2019 Data Download: The number of the day is… 3 percent Three percent.
That’s the percentage of former Maryland Rep. John Delaney’s first quarter fundraising dollars that came from individual donors. The Democratic presidential hopeful technically raised $12.1 million during the first quarter of 2019, but $11.7 million of that came in the form of a loan to himself. After cutting that big check, Delaney’s campaign has $10.6 million in the bank.
Delaney raised just $73,000 in small-dollar donations between January and March, as he hopes to bolster his debate credentials and reach the party’s grassroots donor threshold. But this latest report confirms what we already knew about Delaney—the only thing making him competitive in the money chase right now is his own deep pockets.
We also got a glimpse of another Democratic campaign’s first quarter fundraising on Sunday when Kirsten Gillibrand’s spokeswoman announced the campaign raised $3 million and now has $10.2 million in cash on hand.
Unlike Delaney’s numbers, which come from his official Federal Election Commission report, the Gillibrand numbers are self-reported, so there’s still a lot we don’t know.
That top-line number of $3 million puts her behind every candidate we know of so far except Andrew Yang (and Delaney, but for that $11.7 million loan). But she still has a nice nest egg left over from her Senate campaign account, which can help keep the campaign above water as they kick things into gear.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. SUBSCRIBE April 15, 2019, 1:48 PM GMT By Associated Press A drug that’s used to help control blood sugar in people with diabetes has now been shown to help prevent or slow kidney disease, which causes millions of deaths each year and requires hundreds of thousands of people to use dialysis to stay alive. Doctors say it’s hard to overstate the importance of this study, and what it means for curbing this problem, which is growing because of the obesity epidemic. Related Eli Lilly to offer half-price insulin for people with type 1 diabetes The study tested Janssen Pharmaceuticals’ drug Invokana. Results were discussed Sunday at a medical meeting in Australia and published by the New England Journal of Medicine. About 30 million Americans and more than 420 million people worldwide have diabetes , and most cases are Type 2, the kind tied to obesity. It occurs when the body can’t make enough or properly use insulin, which turns food into energy. This can damage the kidneys over time, causing disease and ultimately, failure. In the U.S., it’s responsible for nearly half a million people needing dialysis, and for thousands of kidney transplants each year. Some blood pressure drugs lower this risk but they’re only partially effective. The new study tested Invokana, a daily pill sold now to help control blood sugar, to see if it also could help prevent kidney disease when added to standard treatments. For the study, about 13,000 people with Type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease from around the world were to be given Invokana or dummy pills. Independent monitors stopped the study early, after 4,400 people had been treated for about 2.5 years on average, when it was clear the drug was helping. Those on the drug had a 30 percent lower risk of one of these problems — kidney failure, need for dialysis, need for a kidney transplant, death from kidney- or heart-related causes, or other signs that kidneys were failing. For every 1,000 people taking the drug for 2.5 years, there would be 47 fewer cases of one of these problems, researchers estimate. Related Why should Americans be grateful for $137 insulin? Germans get it for $55 Rates of serious side effects were similar in the drug and placebo groups including leg, foot or toe amputations, a concern raised by a previous study of Invokana. One side effect, when the body can’t produce enough insulin, was more frequent among those on Invokana but rare overall. Janssen, which is part of Johnson & Johnson , sponsored the study and many authors work or consult for the company. The drug costs about $500 a month in the U.S. Out-of-pocket costs for patients may be different, depending on insurance. The importance of this large and well-done study “cannot be overstated,” Drs. Julie Ingelfinger and Clifford Rosen, editors at the medical journal, wrote in an accompanying article. In recent years, several studies have found that Invokana and some similar drugs can lower heart risks. The new results, showing that Invokana also may stall or prevent kidney failure, expand the potential benefits of the drug. "
'Game of Thrones': The most surprising moments of the Season 8 premiere,www.nbcnews.com,,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/tv/game-thrones-most-surprising-moments-season-8-premiere-n994496,"LOS ANGELES — You can't spell ""Game of Thrones"" without the letters O-M-G. HBO's beloved series, which returned Sunday night for its eighth and final season, has produced some of television's most shocking moments this past decade, from the infamous Red Wedding scene to Cersei blowing up the Sept of Baelor to Jon Snow's death to ... well, you get the point.
SPOILER ALERT: Do not read if you have not watched the season eight premiere of ""Game of Thrones.""
Kit Harington and Emilia Clarke in a scene from season eight of ""Game of Thrones."" Helen Sloane / HBO While it didn't feature any major character deaths — at least not on the surface — the first episode of season eight, titled ""Winterfell,"" had plenty of twists and turns.
Here were the biggest surprises:
Jon Snow learns his true identity: By way of his most loyal friend, Samwell Tarly, Jon Snow learns what viewers found out in the seventh season finale: that Snow is not the ""bastard"" son of Ned Stark after all, but Aegon Targaryen, the son of Lyanna Stark and Rhaegar Targaryen, which makes him the true king of the Iron Throne — and the nephew of Daenerys Targaryen, his current lover.
The many, many reunions: Two of the show's most popular characters, Jon Snow and Arya Stark, were finally reunited after epic journeys back to Winterfell. Also reunited in the season premiere were Snow and Sam (we'll get back to that in a minute), Sansa Stark and brief husband Tyrion Lannister — who hadn't seen each other since Joffrey's demise, and Sansa and Snow, who had a brief exchange about loyalty vs. his love for Daenerys. Meanwhile, Theon Greyjoy broke his prisoner sister Yara out of Euron's evil grasp aboard the Iron Fleet, and the Hound came face-to-face with Arya, the ""bitch"" who tried to kill him (even though deep down he loved being her protector). And last but certainly not least...
Jaime Lannister and Bran Stark meet again: The harrowing final scene of the season premiere saw Jaime Lannister stop dead in his tracks upon arriving at Winterfell, looking squarely into the eyes of Bran Stark, the new Three-Eyed Raven. The last time they locked eyes, Jaime pushed Bran out of a castle window and paralyzed him after the boy witnessed Jamie and his sister, Cersei, making forbidden love in the very first episode, which became the catalyst for the whole series.
The boy on the wall: The most blood-curdling moment of ""Winterfell"" came when Tormund Giantsbane and men of the Night's Watch stumbled upon the corpse of young Lord Umber, who had been nailed to a wall surrounded by a spiral of severed limbs. And that wasn't even the scariest part. As Tormund and Beric Dondarrion turned to exit, Lord Umber suddenly let out a devilish scream from the wall, leading Beric to use his flaming White Walker sword on the poor lad.
A scene from the first episode of season eight of the ""Game of Thrones."" Helen Sloan / HBO Sam learns of his family's demise: After asking Daenerys to pardon him for stealing ""a few books"" from the Citadel that contain Snow's true lineage (she doesn't know that tidbit), Sam Tarly gets a bombshell of his own: Daenerys tells him that she ordered the death of his father and brothers for refusing to leave their land. While Sam openly hated his father, who sent him away to the Night's Watch, the fiery death of his brothers leaves Sam in tears and near-vengeful as he walked out. The Sam-Daenerys scene may have also played a big role in his willingness to tell Jon Snow about his real father, while Snow visited the tomb of Ned Stark, in what should lead to political tension in Winterfell between Snow and Daenerys."
Cherríe Moraga's memoir 'Native Country of the Heart' centers on her mother,www.nbcnews.com,,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/cherr-e-moraga-s-memoir-native-country-heart-centers-her-n993441,"The legendary Chicana playwright, Cherríe Moraga, who’s also best known as co-editor with Gloria Anzaldúa of the foundational feminist anthology ""This Bridge Called My Back: Writings by Radical Women of Color"", has just released her exquisite memoir ""Native Country of the Heart."" But don't expect to read about Moraga’s rise to literary stardom or even about how she and a community of notable writers conceived of the groundbreaking book that restructured feminist theory and criticism. Instead, readers of her memoir will experience a much more intimate journey: the story of Moraga’s complicated relationship with her mother, Elvira.
""Native Country of the Heart"" makes powerful statements about what is gained and lost in the pursuit of the American dream, and how the same place that affords privilege and opportunity, also demands sacrifice and surrender. Courtesy of Macmillan “I had only one romance,” Moraga writes in the preface of the memoir published by Farrar, Straus and Giroux. “The love of an intractable Elvira, and this is what would shape my lesbianism and this is what would mark my road as a Mexican and this is what would require me to remember before and beyond my mother.”
The book takes the reader to Elvira’s youth in Southern California’s Imperial Valley, where her father pulled her out of school in order to labor in the fields. But her charm and resourcefulness gave her access to better opportunities, like working for the American-owned casinos and racetracks south of the border during the Prohibition era.
“I often wondered if my mother’s years in the “Salón de Oro” had ruined her — made an ordinary Mexican life in the United States impossible,” Moraga writes.
Indeed, when Elvira moved on from her glamorous place of employment to start a family with a working class white man, the roles of wife and mother became conventional duties that pushed her into periods of frustration, sometimes expressed violently.
While Moraga is beginning to come to terms with her own sexuality, she looks to her mother for strength, since her mother too appears out of sync with the gender norms of the Mexican household. Yet, Elvira enforced these norms on Moraga and her sister, JoAnne.
“I learned sexism from my mother,” Moraga explains. “She made sure I understood what the rules were and how I was to behave.”
What results is a bittersweet portrait of a woman caught between the expectations of Mexican womanhood and her own desire to strive for something different, something worthy of her intelligence and vision.
As Elvira’s physical and mental health begin to decline, Moraga’s own life is punctuated with a series of personal blessings — the birth of her son, the blossoming of a relationship with her partner Celia, and professional triumphs that included distinguished academic positions and projects that nurtured her interests in queer feminism and indigeneity.
Moraga’s education is the key to her self-actualization, while Elvira’s “inability to read and write well remained an open wound for Elvira her entire life.” Though the two women follow markedly different paths, what continues to connect them is the ache of separation from home. For Elvira, it’s Mexico; for Moraga, it’s Elvira. “There were times when I didn’t know whether my mother was truly “demented” or just Mexican in a white world,” Moraga writes.
Cherrie Moraga, who's also best known as co-editor with Gloria Anzaldua of the foundational feminist anthology ""This Bridge Called My Back: Writings by Radical Women of Color,"" has just released her exquisite memoir ""Native Country of the Heart."" Daniella Rossell The dynamics of the mother-daughter relationship begin to shift once Moraga finds herself having to make decisions on behalf of her mother, whose Alzheimer’s has worsened. This caretaking comes with an awareness that finally brings Moraga closer to Elvira: “I feel myself growing into the compassionate husband, the devoted eldest son, all the missing men in her life — the ones I know she will submit to, if only to be relieved once and for all of the burden of her own self control.”
Eventually, this closeness also leads to a kind of reconciliation or, at the very least, a long-desired affirmation of their familial bond.
After Elvira’s death, Moraga has to come to terms with “life without a Mexican mother,” which prompts her to write this unique memoir, a tribute that began with the writing of the eulogy for Elvira’s funeral.
“The irony of growing up and becoming a writer,” Moraga explains, “is in recognizing that our families are the truest storytellers, and that their histories are our first important stories. All of that is literature. It’s our literature.”
To that end, the story of Elvira is a story of remembering what can be easily forgotten or underappreciated with the passage of time. Moraga amplifies the need to recognize how interwoven the past is to the present, and that to understand ourselves we must locate our ancestors, who are an extension of who we are. Native Country of the Heart makes powerful statements about what is gained and lost in the pursuit of the American dream, and how the same place that affords privilege and opportunity, also demands sacrifice and surrender.
Heart-wrenching and heartwarming, Moraga’s memoir delivers new insights into the acclaimed writer’s creativity, and introduces readers to another of her significant muses: “I made a commitment to depict my mother honestly, as a woman full of complexity, contradictions, and paradoxes,” Moraga adds. “But what I wrote, I wrote out of love.”

E.U. governments on Monday backed the move launched by the European Commission two years ago to protect Europe's creative industries, which employ 11.7 million people in the bloc. ""When it comes to completing Europe's digital single market, the copyright reform is the missing piece of the puzzle,"" the Commission's president Jean-Claude Juncker said in a statement. Under the new rules, Google and other online platforms will have to sign licensing agreements with musicians, performers, authors, news publishers and journalists to use their work. The European Parliament gave a green light last month to a proposal that has pitted Europe's creative industry against tech companies, internet activists and consumer groups. Wikipedia blacked out several European sites in protest last month, while the change was opposed by Finland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Poland and Sweden. But 19 countries, including France and Germany, endorsed the revamp, while Belgium, Estonia and Slovenia abstained. Under the new regime Google-owned YouTube, Facebook's Instagram and other sharing platforms will have to install filters to prevent users from uploading copyrighted materials. Google said the new rules would hurt Europe's creative and digital economies, while critics said it would hit cash-strapped smaller companies rather than the tech giants. Poland said the overhaul was a step backwards as the filter requirement may lay the foundation for censorship. E.U. lawmaker for the European Pirate Party Julia Reda, who had campaigned against the reforms, said critics could take their case to court but it would be slow and difficult and that the best thing would be to monitor fair implementation. The European Magazine Media Association, the European Newspaper Publishers’ Association, the European Publishers Council, News Media Europe and independent music labels lobbying group Impala welcomed the move. E.U. countries have two years to transpose the copyright directive into national laws."
The world's glaciers hold lots of nuclear fallout. Here's what might happen when they melt.,www.nbcnews.com,"Brandon Specktor, Live Science",04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/mach/science/world-s-glaciers-hold-lots-nuclear-fallout-here-s-what-ncna994546,"The world's ice is rapidly disappearing, but not without a trace. Ancient artifacts , frozen corpses , long-dead viruses and loads of trapped greenhouse gases are the parting gifts left behind as Earth's melting glaciers and permafrost retreat. And now, thanks to ongoing global research, a new (and concerning) item can be added to that list: nuclear fallout. In a recent survey of glaciers around the world, an international team of scientists discovered elevated levels of fallout radionuclides — radioactive atoms that result from nuclear accidents and weapons tests — in every single glacier studied.
""We wanted to show this is a global issue and not just localized near sources of nuclear contamination,"" said study researcher Caroline Clason, a University of Plymouth lecturer in physical geography. [ Images of Melt: Earth's Vanishing Ice ]
The good news is these nuclear contaminants likely pose no immediate threat to the environment, said Clason, who presented the team's findings at the European Geosciences Union (EGU) conference on Wednesday (April 10). However, Clason told Live Science, the contaminants at most sites were found in significantly higher levels than what is considered safe for human ingestion. These contaminants could enter the food chain as glaciers continue to melt into rivers, lakes and seas due to climate change .
The sponge in the ice For their new research, Clason and her colleagues looked for nuclear contaminants in cryoconite , a layer of dark sediment found on the surface of many glaciers around the world.
Unlike run-of-the-mill sediments, cryoconite is composed of both inorganic material (like rock minerals) and organic material. The organic parts can include black carbon , or the leftovers from incomplete combustion of fossil fuels; fungus; plant matter; and microbes . This makes cryoconite a very efficient ""sponge"" for airborne contaminants that fall onto glaciers with snow and rain, Clason said. Even more contaminants accumulate in cryoconite as the climate warms and dirty meltwater sweeps across dying glaciers.
Related Environment Environment Iceberg twice the size of New York City set to break off Antarctica The radioactive cryoconite samples came from 17 glaciers spanning locations from Antarctica to the Alps and British Columbia to Arctic Sweden. And these samples didn't just have minor amounts of contamination.
""These are some of the highest levels you see outside of nuclear explosion zones,"" Clason said in her EGU presentation.
Nuclear fingerprints While some of the detected radionuclides, like lead-210, occur naturally in the environment, two isotopes, in particular, can be traced directly to human nuclear activities.
Americium -241, a radioactive isotope that's produced as plutonium decays, was found at many of the glacier sites in quantities that could be hazardous to human health if ingested, the team found. Meanwhile, cesium -137, an isotope produced during nuclear explosions, was found at all 17 sites in quantities tens to hundreds of times greater than expected background levels. These nuclear byproducts were most likely deposited by the Chernobyl nuclear power plant explosion of 1986, the researchers said.
""People knew that [cesium-137] was in the environment after Chernobyl, but they don't know that glaciers are still releasing this continually, 30 years later,"" Clason said at EGU.
Assessing the threat Where they currently sit, these cryoconite contaminants don't pose any known threat to humans or the environment, Clason said. The fear, rather, is that they could pose a threat if they spread through meltwater into rivers and lakes, where grazing animals eat and drink.
There is some historical precedent for these concerns. Wild deer, boar and bears in Europe and Asia all exhibited elevated levels of radioactive cesium following the Chernobyl disaster. And as recently as 2016, tens of thousands of reindeer were deemed unfit to eat in Sweden due to similar concerns about cesium radiation.
Next, the researchers want to figure out whether nuclear contaminants are binding to minerals in cryoconite or to the organic components, which would make the radionuclides much more readily available for uptake into the food chain, Clason said. In the meantime, add this to your list of winter aphorisms: Don't eat the black snow.
""No one's eating the cryoconite,"" Clason said, ""and if they are, I would strongly recommend they don't.""
This research has yet to appear in a peer-reviewed journal.

"Stratolaunch, the world's largest airplane, takes first flight",www.nbcnews.com,"Michael Sheetz, CNBC",04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/mach/science/stratolaunch-world-s-largest-airplane-takes-first-flight-ncna994186,"Aviation has a new number one in size, as a one-of-a-kind airplane completed its first test flight on Saturday morning above California’s Mojave desert, people familiar with the flight told CNBC. The test makes the immense Stratolaunch the largest airplane in the world to fly, with a wingspan measuring 385 feet — wider than a football field is long. With two fuselages and six Boeing 747 engines. Stratolaunch is built to launch rockets from the air.
Stratolaunch is an “air launch” system, meaning that the aircraft will carry rockets up to about 35,000 feet and then drop the rocket. One of the advantages of such a system, touted by Stratolaunch as well as Richard Branson’s Virgin Orbit , is that flying in and out of a traditional runway gives greater flexibility and, eventually, will allow for quick turnaround between launches.
Stratolaunch, a giant six-engine aircraft with the world's longest wingspan , makes its historic first flight from the Mojave Air and Space Port in Mojave, California on April 13, 2019. Matt Hartman / AP The company has had various partnerships, as well as internal plans, for the rockets that Stratolaunch will carry. SpaceX was one of the company’s earliest partners but Stratolaunch later switched to a contract with Northrop Grumman -owned Orbital ATK to fly the Pegeasus XL rocket. Stratolaunch’s plan to develop its own fleet of rockets was scrapped in January.
Related Science Science World's biggest plane, Stratolaunch, marks another key milestone Stratolaunch Systems is owned by Vulcan, which manages the estate of late Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen. The billionaire entrepreneur founded Stratolaunch in 2011, in partnership with specialty aircraft builder Scaled Composites. Allen died in October , following complications of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma.
Allen’s passing is cited as one of the main reasons for the shift in Stratolaunch’s plans at the beginning of this year. When the company announced in January that it was ending development of its own rocket engines and vehicles, Stratolaunch reportedly laid off more than 50 of its 80 employees."
"New 'Patriotic Millionaires' group says: Please, tax me more",www.nbcnews.com,Ali Vitali,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/new-patriotic-millionaires-group-says-please-tax-me-more-n994371,"WASHINGTON — Karen Seal Stewart is rich. And she wants to pay more in taxes. Yes, you read that right.
Stewart is one of the Patriotic Millionaires , a group of about 200 wealthy individuals — worth billions combined — who say they should be taxed more, and as soon as possible.
""It's a matter of equity, fairness and the fact that we have the money to pay the taxes and we're not being asked to pay them,"" Stewart, a former real estate executive, told NBC News. ""My sense is we are really at a cusp. We better get our act together because ... the lack of fairness and opportunity is growing.""
""We see how the system is skewed in our favor and how that's really hurting our country, and in the very long run, hurting us, too,"" Morris Pearl, Patriotic Millionaires chairman and a former BlackRock managing director, said last week at a gathering for the group in Washington.
Group of millionaires want to pay higher taxes, close wealth gap April 15, 2019 03:41 For Pearl, it's about his kids and grandkids being able to ""grow up in the same kind of country where I grew up, to have the opportunities I did. And ... (they) are not going to have the same opportunities I had if we continue the direction we're going.""
Asked about the best ways to fix the tax system, Pearl notes there are ""a lot of possibilities out there.""
Many of those ideas are being floated the Democratic campaign trail , where 2020 hopefuls are putting the wealth gap front and center.
For some, like Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., taxing wealth — as opposed to income — is the answer , a proposal that sets her apart in a Democratic field that largely agrees on rolling back the tax cuts for corporations and top earners that were backed by President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans.
Others in the field, like former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke, support a wealth tax but have not released specific plans. And the Vermont independent Sen. Bernie Sanders has proposed hiking the estate tax, something he estimates would hit the small fraction of Americans who inherit more than $3.5 million.
The idea of taxing the rich more isn't just popular among the Patriotic Millionaires.
In fact, 63 percent of voters think higher-income people pay too little in taxes, according to a Politico-Morning Consult online poll . And Warren's plan plays well across party lines — with 74 percent of Democrats backing her proposal and half of Republicans, in that same poll .
The millionaires aren't backing any specific candidate — though they say Warren is right on taxing wealth. They just want action.
""Important things"" like infrastructure and health care require money, Stewart said. ""You need to get the money where it is. It's with the wealthy. ... Do not feel sorry for us. We will still be fine. And the country will be better off.""

Mueller's report on Russia and Trump to be made public Thursday,www.nbcnews.com,msn.com,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/mueller-s-report-russia-trump-be-made-public-thursday-n994571,"Special counsel Robert Mueller's redacted report on the Russia investigation and President Donald Trump is expected to be made public Thursday morning, the Justice Department said Monday. Washington has been waiting for the release of the report, which has put at loggerheads with congressional Democrats who have demanded that the entire, unredacted document be released after Mueller recently concluded his nearly two-year investigation .
Six House Democratic committee chairs sent a letter to Barr last month requesting that he submit the full report to Congress by April 2. Barr missed that deadline.

Barr sent a four-page letter to Congress last month summarizing Mueller's report that said the special counsel found no proof that Trump or anyone associated with his campaign criminally had colluded with Russia. Barr also said Mueller reached no conclusion about whether Trump obstructed justice, but did not exonerate the president.
Redacted Mueller report expected to be released Thursday April 15, 2019 02:25 ""(W)hile this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him,"" the special counsel said in his report, according to Barr's letter.
Barr said Mueller declined ""to make a traditional prosecutorial judgment,"" leaving it up to the attorney general to choose whether to pursue obstruction charges against the president. Barr stated that he and deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein both concluded, without consulting Mueller, that based on the special counsel's findings Trump would not face an obstruction of justice charge for allegedly attempting to impede the investigation.
Trump, meanwhile, has said Mueller's report represents a total exoneration.
NBC News previously reported that some members of Mueller's team have expressed frustration that Barr cleared Trump of obstruction of justice, and they believe the evidence that Trump sought to thwart the investigation is stronger than Barr suggested, according to a U.S. official who has spoken with the members.
Justice Department officials previously said Barr had no choice but to render judgment because the special counsel regulations placed him in charge of the investigation. If Mueller believed Trump was guilty of obstruction, he could have said so, the officials argued — but he didn't do that in his report.
The DOJ policy that states a sitting president can't be charged with a crime wasn't a factor in the dispute among members of Mueller's team, according to one senior U.S. official, NBC News previously reported .
Rather, the special counsel's team differed about whether they could show that Trump had criminal intent as he took various actions that seemed designed to shut down the investigation, from firing James Comey as FBI director to ordering Mueller's dismissal, only to stand down when his White House counsel threatened to quit, according to The New York Times . NBC News has not confirmed that report.
The official who has spoken to members of Mueller's team said they described the evidence on obstruction as compelling and said it includes more information than has been made public.
Some within the office of the special counsel said their purpose was to leave the legal question open for Congress and the public to examine the evidence, the U.S. official who has spoken to them said. It is not clear how Mueller feels about the matter.
Rudy Giuliani, one of the president's personal attorneys, slammed Mueller's team in a Fox News appearance this month.
""They're a bunch of sneaky, unethical leakers,"" Giuliani said. ""And they are rabid Democrats who hate the president of the United States, and I can't tell you how much false information they leaked during the course of the investigation.""

Democratic chairmen demand Trump admin documents on sanctuary city proposal,www.nbcnews.com,msn.com,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/democratic-chairmen-demand-trump-admin-documents-sanctuary-city-proposal-n994556,"WASHINGTON — Three Democratic House committee chairmen said Monday that the Trump administration lacks the legal authority to transfer undocumented migrants to sanctuary cities, and they’re calling on top officials to provide documents related to the plan’s consideration by early May. “We are deeply troubled by multiple reports, recently confirmed by the President, that the Trump Administration is considering releasing detained immigrants into congressional districts represented by Democrats in a bizarre and unlawful attempt to score political points,” said the lawmakers' letter to acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan.
Minutes after the letter's release, President Donald Trump appeared to confirm that the proposal was in the works. ""Those Illegal Immigrants who can no longer be legally held (Congress must fix the laws and loopholes) will be, subject to Homeland Security, given to Sanctuary Cities and States!"" he tweeted.
White House defends plans for sanctuary cities April 15, 2019 01:37 The three House Democrats who sent the three-page letter were Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler of New York; Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings of Maryland; and Homeland Security Committee Bennie Thompson of Mississippi.
Citing a report by The Washington Post , the chairmen wrote, “This proposal was considered at least twice in the last six months, and the president confirmed on April 12, 2019, that the proposal is once again being given 'strong considerations.'""
The reports are “alarming,” they wrote, adding, “Not only does the Administration lack the legal authority to transfer detainees in this manner, it is shocking that the President and senior Administration officials are even considering manipulating release decisions for purely political reasons.”
In the letter, the chairmen asked that several documents between last November and mid-April be provided to them by May 3, including emails and other communications between Department of Homeland Security officials and White House officials about the transfer or release of immigration detainees to specific locations in the U.S. They also asked for all DHS documents that discussed policy or legal justifications for such a plan.
Last week, Trump tweeted , “Due to the fact that Democrats are unwilling to change our very dangerous immigration laws, we are indeed, as reported, giving strong considerations to placing Illegal Immigrants in Sanctuary Cities only ... ”
The president continued to defend the potential policy over the weekend.
On Saturday he tweeted that Democrats must change the immigration laws. Otherwise, he said, “Sanctuary Cities must immediately ACT to take care of the Illegal Immigrants — and this includes Gang Members, Drug Dealers, Human Traffickers, and Criminals of all shapes, sizes and kinds. CHANGE THE LAWS NOW!”
In a separate tweet, Trump wrote, “Just out: The USA has the absolute legal right to have apprehended illegal immigrants transferred to Sanctuary Cities. We hereby demand that they be taken care of at the highest level, especially by the State of California, which is well known or its poor management & high taxes!”

Cory Booker unveils plan to cut taxes for half the country,www.nbcnews.com,msn.com,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/cory-booker-unveils-plan-cut-taxes-half-country-n994616,"WASHINGTON — Fresh off launching a national campaign tour over the weekend, Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., unveiled a new proposal on Monday to cut taxes for over 150 million Americans. The Rise Credit, as the campaign has dubbed it, would expand on the existing Earned Income Tax Credit, which supplements wages for lower-income workers.
Booker’s plan calls for expanding the tax credit's benefits to higher incomes — from a maximum income of $54,000 to $90,000 for married couples — and raising the maximum benefits as well. Joint filers could receive a 25 percent higher maximum credit, topping out at about $8,000 per year. The plan includes a bigger bump in benefits for childless workers, whose tax credit payout is currently capped at about about $500, but would rise up to about $4,000 under Booker's plan.
What happened to my refund? 2018 taxes explained March 15, 2019 03:45 The proposal is similar to one put out by Economic Security Project Action, a group that advocates for broadening and restructuring the EITC.
An analysis of that plan by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center estimated it would add $2.5 trillion to the deficit over 10 years. Booker's campaign said the senator would finance his proposal by taxing income from investments similarly to other types of income, rather than using a lower capital gains rate.
""It’s unconscionable that hedge fund managers can pay a lower percentage of their income in taxes than their secretaries,"" Booker said in a statement announcing his proposal. ""That's wrong and must change. Creating a fairer, more just tax code begins with putting money in the pockets of Americans who are struggling to get ahead.""
Booker's proposal is the latest in the 2020 Democratic field that would provide direct cash payments to workers via tax credits or similar benefits.
Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., has the LIFT Act, which would create a monthly tax credit of up to $6,000 for families and $3,000 for individuals that's accessible to couples making up to $100,000 a year. Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., who is weighing a run for president, is co-sponsoring legislation that would expand the Earned Income Tax Credit as well as the Child Tax Credit. Businessman Andrew Yang is running on a plan to pay every American adult $1,000 a month. Booker and Harris also have proposals to subsidize housing costs for residents who pay over 30 percent of their income in rent.
""They're all responding broadly to a situation in which wages are flat, everything costs more, and we have to help people close the gap,"" said Adam Ruben, director of Economic Security Project Action.
In addition to the Rise Credit, Booker has released a plan to give every American a “baby bond” on birth that grows depending on family income and would be accessible to young adults to help pay for education or start their career.

Qatari officials participate in peace talks in an undisclosed location in Doha, Qatar, on Feb. 25, 2019. U.S. Special Representative for Afghanistan, Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad, is seen, second left, and the Deputy Commander of the Taliban Movement for Political Affairs, Abdul Ghani Baradar, right. Qatar Foreign Ministry / AP Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. SUBSCRIBE April 15, 2019, 3:49 PM UTC By Reuters KABUL — Women will be included for the first time in the Taliban delegation to talks this month with U.S. officials and Afghan representatives in Qatar over the future of Afghanistan, the movement's main spokesman said on Monday. For a group notorious for its strictly conservative attitude to women's rights, the move represents a step towards addressing demands that women be included in the talks, aimed at bringing an end to more than 17 years of war in Afghanistan. ""There will be women among Taliban delegation members in the Doha, Qatar meeting,"" Zabihullah Mujahid, the Taliban's main spokesman, said by telephone. He did not name the women, but added, ""These women have no family relationship with the senior members of the Taliban, they are normal Afghans, from inside and outside the country, who have been supporters and part of the struggle of the Islamic Emirate."" The April 19-21 meeting in Doha will be the latest in a series of talks between Taliban and U.S. officials and is also expected to include a 150-strong delegation of Afghan politicians and civil society figures. The Taliban have maintained their rejection of formal talks with the Afghan government, which they dismiss as a ""puppet"" regime controlled by the United States. While Afghanistan remains a deeply conservative country, especially in rural areas, there have been major advances in women's rights since the U.S-led campaign of 2001 that toppled the Taliban government. Many women fear that if the group regains some power, many of these gains could be erased. The movement gained worldwide notoriety when it came to power in the 1990s by forcing women to wear full facial covering and imposing severe restrictions including banning girls from school and forbidding women from working outside the home. However Taliban spokesmen say the group has changed and it encourages girls' education and other women's rights within an Islamic Sharia system. Civil society groups, the Western-backed government and Afghanistan's international partners have pressed for women to take part in the talks and news of the Taliban delegation was welcomed. Fawzia Koofi, a former member of parliament who took part in a previous round of meetings in Moscow, said the presence of women in the Taliban team was a ""good step."" ""Only women can feel the pain and miseries that Afghan women have suffered. The presence of women among the Taliban negotiators shows that the Taliban's ideology has changed."" Jean Shaheen, a member of the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee, who has been pressing for women to play a role in the peace talks, said such inclusion would be vital for future international support for Afghanistan. ""There are certain levers that we have, that the Taliban are interested in,"" she told reporters in Kabul, where she was visiting as part of a Congressional delegation. ""There is going to be an interest in economic support after the conflict ends."" ""I think if the Taliban has any interest in getting international support ... it would be in their interest to recognize the importance of including women and including human rights as part of any settlement that happens."""
