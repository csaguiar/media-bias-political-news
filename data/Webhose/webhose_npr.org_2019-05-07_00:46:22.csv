"In Her Debut Novel 'Miracle Creek,' Angie Kim Taps Into Themes She Knows Well",www.npr.org,npr.org,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/12/712862497/in-her-debut-novel-miracle-creek-angie-kim-taps-into-themes-she-knows-well?station=KXJZ_FM,"Angie Kim's debut novel, Miracle Creek, is a courtroom thriller that tackles heavy themes like immigration, parenting and autism.
ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:
The new novel ""Miracle Creek"" is a courtroom thriller. It's a world that author Angie Kim knows well. She worked as a trial lawyer at a big firm. And this book taps into other themes she's familiar with, too. Angie Kim's family came to the U.S. from South Korea when she was a child, just like the central characters in the book. And the story also centers on a group of mothers whose kids have autism. Kim has three children who've each dealt with medical issues and the batteries of tests and treatments that go along with them.
ANGIE KIM: Between all of that, I felt like these are the things that I think were in me that needed to get out because I felt the need when I was in those situations to feel like other people understood.
SHAPIRO: This is Angie Kim's first novel, And it begins with a tragedy. She writes, misfortune doesn't get sprinkled out in fair proportions. Bad things get hurled at you in clumps and batches - unmanageable and messy. ""Miracle Creek"" creates a frame for some of those messy threads in Angie Kim's own life, including a childhood where her parents worked from 6 a.m. to midnight every day.
KIM: I came from this environment in Korea where we were very poor. We had no running water. We had no indoor plumbing. And the three of us - my parents and me - we lived in one room. So we were very poor. And yet, at the same time, I had them with me always.
So to go from that environment to an environment where we were in this luxurious house with multiple indoor bathrooms, which was, like, magical to me - and color TVs, but at the same time losing my parents in the process for several years, it was really painful. And I think throughout my life, I felt this sort of rollercoaster between feeling so lucky to have the chance to come to America from...
SHAPIRO: And attend Harvard Law School and have high-paying jobs, right. You are the...
KIM: Exactly.
SHAPIRO: ...American dream success story.
KIM: Exactly. And how sometimes objectively, your life can look good or bad, so my - objectively, my life in Korea was, you know, poverty ridden and things like that. But then in the nooks and crannies, there can be moments of pure joy even when you are in that, you know, poverty stricken home.
SHAPIRO: Yeah. There is a passage where you write about one painful aspect of the immigrant experience. Will you read this? This is from page 163, about halfway through the book.
KIM: (Read) He'd expected this to happen eventually, had seen how children and parents switch places as the parents age - their minds and bodies reverting to childhood, then infancy, then non-being. But not for many years, and certainly not yet, when Mary still had a foot in childhood. In Korea, he had been the teacher. But after his move when he visited Mary's school, her principal had said welcome. Tell me; how are you liking Baltimore? Pak (ph) smiled, nodded and was deciding how to answer. Perhaps the smile-nod had been enough. When Mary said, he loves it here, running the store right by Inner Harbor, right, Dad? The rest of the meeting, Mary continued speaking for him, answering questions directed his way like a mother with her 2-year-old son.
SHAPIRO: That feels very real and very painful.
KIM: It really, really was. We all intellectually understand it's not their first language. So we understand that it doesn't mean that they're not smart for not speaking it or understanding it. And yet, somehow, language is so important in our society that it's become that way.
And I think that's the other reason why I was so drawn to autism as well because I think especially for the children on the autism spectrum who are non-verbal, it makes me think back to that time when I myself felt so frustrated knowing that I had thoughts within me and saying hey, I'm here, I have opinions, I have thoughts...
SHAPIRO: Yeah.
KIM: ...But not being able to articulate that and then being able to see in other people's eyes that they think less of me because I can't speak in that language.
SHAPIRO: The book includes this community of mothers whose children have autism and have varying degrees of severity. And it's this interesting dynamic where on one level, they're kind of competitive and judgmental and jealous. And on another level, they're sort of the only people who can understand what one another is going through.
KIM: Definitely.
SHAPIRO: Tell me about this community that you built within the framework of the book.
KIM: So I became aware of this community going through all of these, you know, speech therapies and things like that as well as the hyperbaric oxygen therapy, which is something that I highlight in the book as well.
SHAPIRO: This is an alternative form of therapy that is thought - in the book at least - to perhaps help with things ranging from impotence to autism.
KIM: Exactly. And one thing that I experienced myself even though I'm not in the autism community per say, but having been in that world of parents with children with chronic illnesses, when the illness takes over your life - and I think that one thing that it does that's very unexpected for me anyway is that it's very isolating because you find that you don't have as much that you want to talk to your old friends about...
SHAPIRO: Right.
KIM: ...When they have a foot in so-called normalcy because, you know, there's both envy at play and also just a feeling of they're not going to understand what's important in my life on a day-to-day basis. So I think this community becomes very important from that perspective.
But, of course, the stakes in this world are very high because it's not just a matter of oh, is your kid going to get into this college or that, it's much more fundamental than that. What is going to happen to my child when I die?
You know, so it's very heightened emotions from that perspective. And that's one of the reasons why I decided to highlight that conflict but also closeness and intimacy.
SHAPIRO: There's one moment that I want to ask you about when a character who is one of these mothers of children with autism says - clearly feeling great shame in saying this - she says I wish my child was dead. And another woman tells her we all have our moments. But they're just moments. And they pass.
So if a tiny part of us has these thoughts a tiny part of the time, thoughts we shut out as soon as they creep in, is that so bad? Isn't that just human? People don't often hear that perspective. Why did you want to include it?
KIM: I wanted to include it because I think there is this myth of a Good Mother. And I say Good Mother, and in my head, I'm seeing Good Mother capitalized, you know.
SHAPIRO: Capital G, capital M.
KIM: Yes, exactly. And I think that when you are in this situation day in and day out, there are thoughts that creep in that are shameful. And I think that because of our society's enormous pressure on mothers to be perfect and to be self-sacrificing, that those thoughts make the mothers feel so much shame.
And one thing that I've been hearing from a lot of early readers is that when they're in this situation, they have had similar thoughts that are fleeting. And they would never say it out loud even to their closest friends or to their family members or to their spouses. But hearing a character - even though it's a fictional character in a book - say that and think that and to be able to witness that made them feel like they weren't monsters themselves.
SHAPIRO: Angie Kim, thanks so much for talking with us. And congratulations on your debut novel.
KIM: Thank you so much, Ari. It was a pleasure.
SHAPIRO: Her book is called ""Miracle Creek.""

Former Diplomats Reflect On Impact Of WikiLeaks Release Of Diplomatic Cables In 2010,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/12/712862490/former-diplomats-reflect-on-impact-of-wikileaks-release-of-diplomatic-cables-in-?station=KXJZ_FM,"Nearly a decade after WikiLeaks published thousands of diplomatic cables, one former ambassador describes it as ""the toxic gift that keeps on giving."" Diplomats spent years rebuilding trust with other governments.
ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:
The State Department was forced into damage control when WikiLeaks published thousands of diplomatic cables back in 2010. Then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called it an attack on U.S. foreign policy and international alliances. Now that Julian Assange is facing charges related to that leak, we wondered whether it left a lasting impact on U.S. diplomacy. Here's NPR's Michele Kelemen.
MICHELE KELEMEN, HOST:
Retired diplomat Barbara Leaf was in Rome reading The New York Times on an unclassified computer on the day in 2010 when the WikiLeaks cables hit the news. She was shocked to see what's called a NODIS, or no distribution cable, which are normally very restrictive.
BARBARA LEAF: Then I was like, oh, my God. You know? I got to turn this thing off, you know? It was - but beyond the comic moment which, literally, I thought, did I just give myself a security violation by looking at a NODIS cable on an un-class terminal, it wreaked havoc. These cables wreaked havoc.
KELEMEN: That was especially true at her next assignment, in Iraq, where some embassy contacts had been harassed and threatened because they were named in diplomatic cables published by WikiLeaks. She says she and her colleagues became far more judicious in what they wrote in those official reports.
LEAF: Some people, I would not name. Yes. Absolutely. I would not put names in cables because of that. Government officials are generally different. But when you're talking to some, you know, average citizen, or somebody who is willing to talk candidly about policies or activities of their government that they know, you know, it's - you know, it's a third-rail topic, or what have you, I didn't put their names in cables forever after.
KELEMEN: Diplomats write these cables to give Washington policymakers a sense of what's happening in the country where they serve. They used to be accessible even to military officers in the field until Chelsea Manning helped WikiLeaks gain access to them. Now access is even more limited. And that's a problem, says Mary Thompson-Jones, another former career diplomat who teaches at the U.S. Naval War College.
MARY THOMPSON-JONES: Not enough people read the cables. That was true then and that's true now. The only person that you're guaranteed is going to read your cable is the poor desk officer who's handling everything that has to do with the country to which you've been assigned.
KELEMEN: She downplays the lasting impact of WikiLeaks on the State Department, saying Julian Assange's moment has come and gone.
THOMPSON-JONES: Technology has moved at lightning speed since then. Every embassy has Facebook, it has social media. Ambassadors get out, and they're tweeting about things. So we're in a different era already than we were nine years ago.
KELEMEN: Looking back, some diplomats joke that there was an upside to the scandal. The world got to see what diplomats do and find out that some are pretty colorful writers. The downside was that government officials who didn't like how they were described gave U.S. diplomats the cold shoulder and didn't let them take notes in meetings. That lasted for a while, says Barbara Leaf, who was the ambassador to the United Arab Emirates until she retired last year.
LEAF: There was an exquisite agony that these governments, friendly governments, felt in talking to us for a very long time. I got out to UAE four years after this, and they were still gun shy about all of this. So, you know, it is the toxic gift that keeps on giving.
KELEMEN: The State Department says it stands by previous assessments that the WikiLeaks disclosures were harmful and put lives and careers at risk. A former spokesman says the impact was serious but admittedly hard to quantify. Michele Kelemen, NPR News, the State Department.

Some Experts Remain Skeptical As Boeing And FAA Work To Assure 737 Max Jet Is Safe,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/12/712862466/some-experts-remain-skeptical-as-boeing-and-faa-work-to-assure-737-max-jet-is-sa?station=KXJZ_FM,"As Boeing and the Federal Aviation Administration work to certify critical updates to the 737 Max jet following two deadly crashes, the FAA is under renewed criticism for saying the aircraft was safe.
ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:
Officials with the Federal Aviation Administration spent hours today speaking with pilots and executives at Southwest, United and American Airlines. They are the three U.S. airlines that fly the Boeing 737 Max. Questions about the FAA's role in certifying the plane have grown in the weeks since the second fatal crash of a 737 Max. The jet is still grounded. And now, the FAA has to reassure airlines and regulators in other countries that whenever it says the 737 Max is safe to fly again, that is, in fact, accurate. NPR's Russell Lewis reports.
RUSSELL LEWIS, BYLINE: This week on Capitol Hill, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao continued her defense of the FAA amid questions about why it approved the Boeing 737 Max.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
ELAINE CHAO: The department's goal is to ensure public trust in aviation safety and preserve the preeminence of the United States as the gold standard in aviation safety.
LEWIS: The U.S. is enjoying its safest period of air travel ever - one single fatality on a major U.S. commercial airline in the past decade. But following the crashes of 737 Max's in Indonesia and Ethiopia, questions are swirling whether the FAA has taken a hit as the world's premier aviation regulator.
SHEM MALMQUIST: So the answer is yes, the FAA has lost some of that credibility.
LEWIS: Shem Malmquist has been involved in aviation and aviation safety since the 1970s. He teaches advanced aircraft operations at Florida Institute of Technology and also currently flies the Boeing 777. He says people in the industry had assumed the FAA was doing everything it could to ensure safety. So was John Strickland, a longtime aviation consultant based in England.
JOHN STRICKLAND: Of course, at the end of the day, what matters is safety. There can only be one objective - that it delivers a safe aircraft which airlines can be confident in and that we, the traveling public, can be confident in.
LEWIS: That's one reason why aviation regulators in Canada, Europe and elsewhere say they plan to double-check the 737 Max software fixes once they're approved by the FAA. Strickland says that's surprising, and before these accidents, almost unheard of.
For decades, the FAA relied on manufacturers like Boeing to help in the review and certification of new jets. These planes are increasingly complex, with millions of lines of computer code understood best by the people who designed them. When the 737 Max was approved, it was one of the first jets signed off under new rules that gave Boeing even more authority in the approval process.
The FAA has told Congress for the agency to take over all certifications, it would need an additional 10,000 employees at $1.8 billion. Jim Higgins chairs the aviation department at the University of North Dakota. He says it's not as easy as just throwing more money at the problem.
JIM HIGGINS: Because it takes many years to train people to become aircraft design engineers for these types of aircraft and then many more to - for them to get the experience to be kind of in an oversight role.
LEWIS: The extra attention being shined on Boeing and the FAA is important, says Shem Malmquist, the Florida Tech professor and pilot. He says now that regulators in other countries are planning to scrutinize the 737 Max fixes, there's value in having men and women from varying backgrounds studying the updates.
MALMQUIST: I think there's something to be said by having different cultures from around the world looking at these things a lot closer. They may capture something just based on their cultural perspective that we didn't consider.
LEWIS: The FAA, for its part, says it welcomes the added scrutiny. Here's acting administrator Daniel Elwell.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
DANIEL ELWELL: As recent events have reminded us, aviation safety has no borders or boundaries.
LEWIS: But don't expect a potential fix anytime soon. The updates to the Boeing 737 Max aren't expected for weeks and possibly months. Russell Lewis, NPR News.

ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:
We want to take a moment now to wish happy birthday to a woman many of us grew up on. Children's book author Beverly Cleary turns 103 today, which gives us an excuse to celebrate her.
AILSA CHANG, HOST:
Yes. Ramona Quimby, Beezus, ""The Mouse And The Motorcycle"" - vroom-vroom.
SHAPIRO: Cleary's books have sold more than 90 million copies. As she told Oregon Public Broadcasting, she wasn't always a big reader.
(SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, ""DISCOVERING BEVERLY CLEARY"")
BEVERLY CLEARY: Oh, I remember a moment of terror in the first grade when we were in a reading circle. And I'd figured ahead what word I was going to have to read. And it was city. And I knew it wasn't pronounced kitty, but I couldn't remember.
CHANG: About two years later, she was browsing through a book when something happened.
(SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, ""DISCOVERING BEVERLY CLEARY"")
CLEARY: I was really just looking at the pictures and discovered I was reading it and enjoying what I read. It was quite a revelation.
CHANG: She started reading more and writing stories, too. The school librarian suggested she become an author.
SHAPIRO: She grew up, went to college and became a children's librarian in Yakima, Wash. She learned to write for children there, standing up in front of big groups and telling them stories.
CHANG: A few years later, she was ready to write books of her own.
(SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, ""DISCOVERING BEVERLY CLEARY"")
CLEARY: And I waited and waited, and no ideas came. And I thought about the little boy in the Yakima Public Library who (laughter) faced me rather ferociously once and said, where are the books about kids like us? And it changed my whole attitude.
CHANG: And the rest is history.
SHAPIRO: Thanks to Oregon Public Broadcasting and their documentary ""Discovering Beverly Cleary.""
CHANG: In honor of Cleary, April 12 is Drop Everything and Read day. So if you want to celebrate Beverly Cleary's 103 years, find some time on this Friday and read a book.

Power In The White House Is Growing With Acting Agency And Cabinet Department Heads,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/12/712862452/power-in-the-white-house-is-growing-with-acting-agency-and-cabinet-department-he?station=KXJZ_FM,"With so many acting cabinet secretaries who do not need Senate confirmation many Republican Senators are concerned the Trump administration is weakening their advice and consent Constitutional role.
ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:
The Senate's vote this week to confirm former oil lobbyist David Bernhardt for interior secretary means there's one less temp in President Trump's cabinet. It brings the number of acting heads of agencies and Cabinet departments from 13 to 12. More than any other president, Trump has used short-term appointments to keep the government running. NPR's Kelsey Snell reports that all that churn means the power in the White House is growing as the checks and balances of the Senate start to vanish.
KELSEY SNELL, BYLINE: The Constitution is pretty clear about how the top jobs in federal government are supposed to be filled. It's right there in Article II, Section 2. The president shall nominate, and the Senate shall give advice and consent. Senator Lamar Alexander says it's a critical job with real consequences.
LAMAR ALEXANDER: But when it breaks down, we actually give the president more power because he can appoint all these acting people and ignore the United States Senate, which is just the reverse of what the founders intended.
SNELL: But the Tennessee Republican says that's not what's happening right now. Acting heads are running departments like Homeland Security and Defense and agencies like the Federal Aviation Administration, or FAA, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA. And President Trump told CBS earlier this year that all that instability is by design.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I like acting because I can move so quickly. It gives me more flexibility.
SNELL: Trump may like it, but that's not what the Constitution intended.
ALEXANDER: Because our founders didn't want a king - so they said, we're not going to let the president have all the power.
SNELL: Unease over the instability within the Trump administration has spread in recent months as the number of vacancies and acting heads expanded. There's almost universal agreement among senators that there is a real risk in letting the standards slip too far, but there's not a lot of agreement about who's to blame or how to stop it. Louisiana Senator John Kennedy points to Democrats.
JOHN KENNEDY: I believe that at least part of the White House's thinking is that we could send over Alexander Hamilton, and the Democrats would object.
SNELL: He says Trump was forced to get creative. In many cases, the law gives presidents some latitude to use temps to fill in while a permanent replacement is confirmed. And Kennedy says it's only logical for the White House to use that wiggle room to get around some political roadblocks. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says it's not just that. The Senate is doing its best to keep up with other nominees, including his pledge to fill a sea of federal court vacancies with Trump's conservative appointees.
MITCH MCCONNELL: I've got my hands full just trying to clean up the executive calendar we already have.
SNELL: McConnell downplayed the loss of power that happens when the Senate no longer has a responsibility to publicly vet and approve a nominee. He says when Trump finds a permanent agency head, the Senate will do its job.
MCCONNELL: I don't have any advice to give to the president about nominations, but I got - we got plenty of them to work on already. And if he sends up a nominee for an important position, like Cabinet post, it'll go to the front of the line. And we'll process it as early as we can.
SNELL: Florida Republican Marco Rubio has a different view. He has watched the agencies change in recent years. He says the partisan fights over nominees have been damaging to the entire process, but the lack of permanent bosses is causing serious problems.
MARCO RUBIO: I didn't used to believe that, but I've seen that when you're in an acting role, it's very different than when you're confirmed by the Senate, just in terms of the respect you command and even your control over the agency and the individuals underneath you.
SNELL: Texas Senator John Cornyn agrees with Rubio. Agency heads should be publicly vetted. They should have to be approved, and they should be there permanently.
JOHN CORNYN: It's not ideal, but it is certainly within the law.
SNELL: For all of their frustration, there's not much senators can do to exercise their constitutional power until Trump gives them permanent nominees to vote on. Kelsey Snell, NPR News, the Capitol.

Dionne of The Washington Post and Brookings Institution, and David Brooks of The New York Times, about the Trump administration's border strategy, Attorney General Barr's testimony and Benjamin Netanyahu's victory in Israel.
AILSA CHANG, HOST:
President Trump has promised a tougher approach to immigration. And sure enough, in a tweet today, he said he's giving strong consideration to, quote, ""placing illegal immigrants in sanctuary cities only."" Here's what the president said at the White House today.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: They want more people in their sanctuary cities, well, we'll give them more people. We can give them a lot. We can give them an unlimited supply, and let's see if they're so happy. They say, we have open arms. They're always saying they have open arms. Let's see if they have open arms.
CHANG: The administration has so far offered no details on what this would look like in practice, so lots of questions. And we're going to talk through them and more now with our Friday regulars E.J. Dionne of The Washington Post and the Brookings Institution, and David Brooks of The New York Times. Nice to see you guys.
E J DIONNE, BYLINE: Great to be with you.
DAVID BROOKS, BYLINE: Great to see you.
CHANG: All right. So President Trump is threatening to release migrants who've been detained into these so-called sanctuary cities. These are cities where local law enforcement has decided to limit cooperation with federal immigration officials like LA, Chicago, Denver. And in this tweet I read, the president said he's doing this because, quote, ""Democrats are unwilling to change our very dangerous immigration laws.""
David, do you think this tweet is actually spelling out policy or does it feel more just like a political provocation?
BROOKS: Well, first, it's morally illiterate. These are human beings. We don't treat them as a sort of a subtweet of a prank. But it's of a piece with the Trump policy, which is not really a policy but just a posture of toughness. It's just showbiz. It's sort of performance art to make his base feel good.
And any mayor running this system would create a system. He would expand the detention centers. He'd get more judges to speed the back flow. We'd have a system where you could vet kids in their home countries so they don't have to walk all the way up here. You do a number of concrete things that any normal administration could do. But we don't do that because we just have a posture. We don't have a system. And as a result, we have chaos at the border.
CHANG: E.J., do you agree?
DIONNE: Yeah. Well, first of all, nothing should surprise us anymore about Trump. But the notion that he would use human beings, as David said, purely as political pawns, as what he sees as political punishment for those who disagree with him - I mean, what comes next, he audits - he urges audits of all income taxes of the people who want him to make his taxes public? I mean, there's just something deeply outrageous about this. And we've lost our capacity for outrage.
I think what you are seeing is the difficulty of reaching any agreement on immigration, which is always hard, even when people have goodwill. They - Bush - President Bush, the second one, tried to get immigration reform through. His party foiled him. There was a bill that went through the Senate under Obama. It was foiled. Now you have no goodwill at all coming from the White House, using it only as a political issue for Trump's re-election.
CHANG: Now, on solutions to immigration, E.J., your paper, The Washington Post, is reporting that when the White House first raised this idea months ago about putting migrants in sanctuary cities, ICE leadership said it was not a good idea. But are President Trump's threats to get tougher on immigration putting pressure on Democrats to come up with more viable solutions for the situation at the border?
DIONNE: Well, the one person who has put out a detailed immigration plan among the candidates for president is Julian Castro. And whether you agree with it or not, I think he set out sort of a position that would be compromised a lot if he ever tried to negotiate it. But at least he's come out there and says, here's what I will do. I think the party, like on a lot of issues, has - let's put it charitably - multiple minds where they should go.
And I think a lot of people say, what's the point of putting out a position when we know that we can't negotiate with Trump? Nonetheless, I think over time, they simply have to take a stand, say, here's what we'll do, and let that be their political position - i.e. we're going to try to solve the problem.
BROOKS: Shockingly, I'd be a lot harder on the Democrats. You know, Castro, I think it's - one of the things he does is he repeals a 1929 law making illegal entry a federal crime, which takes immigration very far. I think a lot of the candidates don't know where the left is on this. They don't know how far that we've gone toward open borders, and they don't want to make a mistake. And therefore they don't have policies. But it's making - I think it's politically and morally extremely foolish not to have a policy on what to do with the big central question on our southern border.
CHANG: All right.
DIONNE: I just want to say, on Castro, I think the fact that he came out there is going to put pressure on other Democrats to put out plans. It's still a long time before between now and the caucuses. But on the point that I think they have to say something and be reasonably clear, I agree with that.
CHANG: All right. I want to turn to Attorney General William Barr now. We're expecting a redacted version of the Mueller report to come any day now. And Barr was on the Hill this week testifying about that report. But he also mentioned something else that took a lot of people by surprise. He said that the Obama administration had spied on the Trump campaign.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
WILLIAM BARR: I think there was - spying did occur. Yes, I think spying did occur.
CHANG: All right. So President Trump has repeatedly accused the Obama White House of spying on his campaign. Barr chimes in this week, seems to agree with him, which prompted House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to say that Barr is doing President Trump's political bidding. David, do you agree with Pelosi on that?
BROOKS: I don't know. The guy does seem to be one for dropping tidbits and then not elaborating. And so I don't think he should have said the spying thing without explaining exactly what it was he was talking about because it was bound to be a bombshell. But in general, I'm willing to wait on this. A lot of people are leaping to conclusions and postures and attitudes without knowing what's in the report or how he's really doing. It'll be out in a few days. Let's just wait.
CHANG: All right.
DIONNE: Four strikes and you're out. I mean, he put out that summary which was - didn't even have a full quote from the Mueller report. He absolved Trump of obstruction by fiat. Now he does the spying thing. And he has been totally muddled. I think for Democrats, he has shown himself to be a partisan figure and not the attorney general of everybody.
CHANG: All right. In our last minute, I want to talk briefly about the Israeli elections. We saw Benjamin Netanyahu win a fifth term as prime minister. And I want to ask you, what does this outcome tell us? Because he won this pretty close election despite the fact he's fighting a lot of corruption allegations. David, you want to begin?
BROOKS: Well, first, if you're a Democrat, don't get overconfident because these kind of campaigns can win. Second, we're in a different situation. Israel tried to be a pluralistic ethnic country with the Oslo peace process and all that. It failed. Netanyahu is the kind of leader you elect when you fail to become a pluralistic democracy. We're still trying to do that. We want to be that kind of country.
CHANG: All right. E.J., in the last 30 seconds.
DIONNE: I think that Israelis, for now, have given up on the peace process. And they see Netanyahu as a tough guy who can hold things together. But boy, there are lessons for us in this. He ran a really scurrilous campaign against Arabs. He tried to decrease the Arab vote, and he succeeded. He is Trump's friend, and Trump helped him.
CHANG: That's E.J. Dionne of The Washington Post and the Brookings Institution, and David Brooks of The New York Times. Thanks to both of you.
BROOKS: Thank you.
DIONNE: Good to be with you.

Civil servant Tricia Newbold recently became a whistleblower, approaching a federal government watchdog and Congress to report senior officials overturning security clearance denials for White House staff.
She is protected from retaliation under the Whistleblower Protection Act, which marks its 30th anniversary this week. Since the law was enacted the number of people exposing government wrongdoing has gone up — and so has bipartisan support for protecting those who speak out. Whistleblower Says White House Overturned 25 Denied Security Clearances
But it's not without its risks. Robert MacLean was a federal air marshal in 2003 when he told the public that the Transportation Security Agency cancelled air marshal coverage on long-haul flights to cover budget shortfalls.
""Everybody in my neighborhood and my family thought I was insane, and I was fighting a futile fight,"" he told NPR. ""It's infuriating because you know what the truth is. And the officials know what the truth is. But they're going to ignore you.""
The TSA reversed its position, but it also fired him for releasing information about the threats to U.S. aviation. MacLean fought it, winning a Supreme Court battle for reinstatement in 2015. Then he was fired again this year.
If a whistleblower reports waste, fraud, abuse, illegality, or threats to public health or safety, they have legal rights.
The last three decades have seen a number of notable and sometimes controversial whistleblowers, such as Dr. David Graham, a researcher at the Food and Drug Administration who said his agency had ignored warnings that the painkiller Vioxx had lethal side effects; and Franz Gayl, a Marine corps whistleblower who raised the alarm about troops lacking properly armored vehicles that would protect them from IEDs. In both cases the government was forced to change their policies.
As the legal director of the Government Accountability Project, a nonpartisan law firm that aids whistleblowers, Tom Devine has worked with about 7,000 of them over the last 40 years.
He helps these individuals tell their stories by providing them a legal defense — and says he sees one similar trait in their motivations for going public.
""The common characteristic is that they have to act on their knowledge in order to be true to themselves,"" Devine said. ""If they don't, what they concealed is something that will be haunting them like a cancer in their soul for the rest of their lives, particularly if there's some consequences from them not speaking out.""
And more are choosing to speak out. The number of reports against waste, fraud and abuses at federal agencies has increased dramatically over the last thirty years. Duke Whistleblower Gets More Than $33 Million In Research Fraud Settlement
The Office of Special Counsel, an independent agency unrelated to Special Counsel Robert Mueller, is tasked with protecting federal whistleblowers from retaliation.
In 1988, the office received just 120 whistleblower disclosures . Last year, the OSC received 1,559 new cases — the fifth year they have received more than 1,500.
""When I first came to the Government Accountability Project whistleblowers were generally considered nutty or traitors betraying their colleagues,"" Devine said. ""Now whistleblowers are lionized as the public's eyes and ears.""
And as the cultural view towards whistleblowers have changed, so have the legal protections, which have been updated over the past 30 years and most recently in 2012 .
Rep. Gerry Connolly, D-Va., who chairs the Oversight subcommittee that has jurisdiction over the law, says it's essential for keeping government honest.
""I'm glad we have it. I think it is an important tool in accountability,"" he told NPR.
At a time when the left and right can't seem to agree on legislative priorities or even which topics are worth congressional investigation, they both agree on whistleblower protection — but for different reasons.
Pete Sepp, from the conservative National Taxpayers Union, explains that, ""as a fiscal conservative whistleblower protection means taxpayer protection."" But Shanna DeVine, from the progressive advocacy group Public Citizen, told NPR that ""whistleblowers are the public's eyes and ears to abuses of power that betray the public trust.""
It's this broad consensus, formed by different ideological justifications, that is the strongest assurance of keeping or even strengthening these safeguards in years to come. "
"Book Review: 'Optic Nerve,' By María Gainza : NPR",www.npr.org,Lily Meyer,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/13/710414549/optic-nerve-tells-a-life-story-through-visions-of-art,"Optic Nerve by Maria Gainza
Hardcover, 193 pages |
purchase close overlay Buy Featured Book Title Optic Nerve Author Maria Gainza Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How?
Amazon Independent Booksellers Optic Nerve , the Argentine writer María Gainza's first novel, tells the reader very little about its protagonist. Her name is María, like her creator; she's an art critic from a fallen-aristocracy background; she lives in Buenos Aires; and at some point in her life, she becomes scared of flying. That's about it. But Gainza, in a gorgeous translation by Thomas Bunstead, mines María's elusiveness — and allusiveness; she's great with a well-placed quotation — to create a highly compelling life story told almost entirely through art.
Each chapter of Optic Nerve works the same way. María combines an art experience with a biographical one, using the former to understand or illuminate the latter. This is never a guessing game. The parallels are always clear, beginning in the first chapter, in which an Albert de Dreux painting of a deer triggers María's memory of a friend who died in a freak hunting accident. ""I cannot tell what I should do with a death as ridiculous as hers,"" she admits, ""as pointless and hypnotic, nor do I know why I mention it now, though I suppose it's always probably the way: you write one thing in order to talk about something else.""
This self-awareness runs throughout the novel. María constantly catches her own rhetorical strategies. She exposes them, then continues to use them, exhibiting her critical tricks alongside a steady stream of criticism. Gainza's strategy here is bold, and effective. Plenty of novelists invent writers and artists in whose talent the reader is expected to believe. J.D. Salinger assumes no one will question the Glass family's genius; Elena Ferrante feels no need to give samples of the fictional Elena's writing. Optic Nerve does the reverse. It's a book about an art critic, and it's full of extremely good art criticism. We know María's the real deal.
Book Reviews The Stories In 'Guestbook' Linger Like Ghosts Book Reviews In 'Saturn's Return,' Astrology Is A Framework, But Not A Fix María's descriptions of art are one of Optic Nerve 's great pleasures. Without fail, they are lyric but unpretentious, imaginative and compelling. A red Rothko painting ""seeps into you bodily, not so much through your eyes as like a fire at stomach level. At points it even seems to me that Rothko creates not so much works of art as smoldering, endless blocks of fire, akin to the burning bush from Exodus."" Or, for those who prefer the Renaissance, there's El Greco's painting of Christ in the olive grove, in which ""gravity functions in reverse: something draws the figures skyward, sucking them in the direction of the clouds, like the bubbles in the lava lamps of my adolescence.""
All this might seem a bit over-intellectualized, but thanks to Gainza's dry wit and realism, it's the reverse. María might like citing the morose Italian poet Cesare Pavese, but she's also prone to invoking the ""reality-TV rule: as long as no children are harmed, anything goes."" She seems immune to snobbery and grounded in her own body and experiences. Most importantly, she's very skeptical of her own intelligence. She doesn't doubt how smart she is; nor does she set much store by it. Early in her career, she decides, ""To ever feel that you understand anything only means that your mind has turned rigid."" By the time she becomes a fully professional writer, she has learned to respect her physical responses to art, ""to pay attention to [them], because my body always works things out before I do. Only afterward does my intellect draw its conclusions.""
María's descriptions of art are one of 'Optic Nerve's great pleasures. Without fail, they are lyric but unpretentious, imaginative and compelling.
María may not care much about her intellect, but she's still got a massive amount to teach the reader. She begins the novel as a tour guide, and functions as one throughout, leading the reader through both Argentina's National Museum of Fine Art and through her own life. Optic Nerve would be worth reading as an art history lesson alone; its descriptions of great paintings are phenomenal, as are its lives-of-the-artists anecdotes. The best and most heartbreaking is a party Picasso threw in Rousseau's honor. At the end, ""all the guests stood to applaud the brilliance of [Rousseau], and tears were flowing freely as they led him out to his car — only for Picasso, with the cruelty of all true cowards, to confess that the whole thing had been a joke."" That joke echoes María's own rejection of the art world's glamorous side. There's no condemnation or moralizing, only a quiet turning away from money and parties, toward brilliance wherever she can find it.
Optic Nerve is intentionally quiet throughout. Looking at an early Monet, María comments that in her view, ""any artist too dependent on either seeking or presenting new and astonishing experiences will cease to be effective once he or she succeeds in ... apportioning that sense of discovery."" Gainza's own artistic tactic, it seems, is to keep her narrator's sense of discovery alive throughout the novel. With each chapter, María finds a new artist to love, and, in doing so, accesses a new part of herself. It's a pleasure to watch her do both.

"Speaking With Siddharth Dube, Author Of 'A Personal History Of Outlawed Love And Sex' : Goats and Soda : NPR",www.npr.org,Siddharth Dube,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2019/04/13/705560834/taunted-as-a-sissy-boy-siddharth-dube-shares-his-life-story-in-new-memoir,"Enlarge this image Siddharth Dube, a longtime public health advocate, has written a memoir: An Indefinite Sentence: A Personal History of Outlawed Love and Sex. Hindustan Times/Getty Images Hindustan Times/Getty Images Siddharth Dube, a longtime public health advocate, has written a memoir: An Indefinite Sentence: A Personal History of Outlawed Love and Sex.
Hindustan Times/Getty Images He says he knows what it's like to live the life of an outcast.
Siddharth Dube came of age as a gay man in India in the 1990s — a time when a law dating back to 1864, Section 377, criminalized homosexuality, calling it an ""unnatural offense."" (The law was struck down by India's Supreme Court in September 2018.)
Now a specialist in poverty and public health policy, Dube has written a memoir, An Indefinite Sentence: A Personal History of Outlawed Love and Sex.
The book is not just about his own quest to find love and societal acceptance. It's also an account of the activism of India's marginalized sex workers and LGBT community as they battled violations of their human rights in the earliest days of the AIDS epidemic — having blood drawn without consent, for example.
A graduate of Tufts University, the University of Minnesota's School of Journalism and the Harvard School of Public Health, Dube has worked and consulted for the World Bank, UNICEF and the World Health Organization and was senior adviser in 2005-2006 to the executive director of UNAIDS, a special United Nations effort to tackle AIDS.
You write about how you were constantly taunted during your school years for acting like a ""sissy boy."" How did you cope during this difficult time?
I coped by trying to my utmost to behave just like other boys, including my brothers, to exactly copy their mannerisms and their interests. I also desperately excised any aspects of my mannerisms that I thought were feminine and hence forbidden to males, including gentleness. Unfortunately, my efforts didn't succeed. All through my school years, and then into my undergraduate college years in Delhi, I was mocked and ostracized for being ""sissy"" and ""girly.""
How did your family treat you?
I was enormously lucky as my parents were not only fiercely protective of us children but they also had a remarkably independent-thinking streak. So I didn't face any censure from them about my femininity — not once! In contrast, I did begin to feel a sense of distance and inferiority to my brothers as a result of being teased by them about my feminine looks and mannerisms.
Do you think it's any different for boys growing up today in India – or around the world? Do we still hold the same rigid and potentially damaging views about gender?
Boys and men in many parts of India are raised to be far more gentle and ""feminine"" — and comfortable with physical and emotional intimacy — than is the norm for Western/American males. This was true then [in the '70s], and remains true until today.
Yet despite those attitudes, you lived as a gay man in India in the 1980s and '90s at a time when homosexuality was outlawed by Section 377. What was that like?
Arguably, the worst impact was the deadening sense of fear we all lived in. I remember the utter terror I felt when I was arrested with my long-term partner in Delhi one night in 1988, merely because we lived openly together. The only reason we weren't persecuted further was because of my family's privileged position. Few other Indians had that kind of protection, and so the wiser course in those dangerous times for most gay Indian men and women was to be invisible, to deny themselves normal, fulfilled lives.
How damaging was this silence for the LGBT community?
The silence had to do with a very real fear of persecution, exposure and shame. The consequences were tragic. For instance, there is no doubt that countless gay men and trans individuals in India contracted HIV as a result of the fears engendered by Section 377. By now, because of the AIDS pandemic, it is well understood how criminalization and marginalization multiply the risks of disease, for instance by keeping people from openly learning about safe-sex methods or by forestalling healthy romantic relationships.
And now that the law is gone ...?
There is an enormous sense of relief, the feeling that we can hope to lead full lives with the expectation of happiness and fulfillment just like everyone else.
Another huge impact is in restoring a sense of self-respect and dignity. And we are now filled with hope and determination that these changes will be speedily reflected in vital legal and policy changes in India — such as in terms of equalizing marriage, inheritance and adoption rights irrespective of sexual or gender orientation.
In your book, you tell us how the AIDS pandemic affected the lives of women sex workers in India.
The first few cases of HIV in India were identified in women sex workers in 1986. Consequently, [these women sex workers] came to be associated with AIDS, just as the United States epidemic came to be associated with gay men.
And just as in the U.S. with gay men, women sex workers in India were the victims of persecution and abuse by the government as well as from other quarters. They were arrested in mass drives, their blood was drawn without consent and they were cruelly incarcerated for months and even years, separated from their children and families without being told why. It is because of those experiences that countless sex workers in India have long demanded decriminalization of their work.
And you support that position?
Decriminalizing sex work frees the many women, trans individuals and men who sell sex from the fear of prosecution by the police and other arms of the state. It is the necessary starting point for enabling them to tackle the other hardships they face, ranging from societal stigma and imbued notions of shame to feelings of powerlessness.
An Indefinite Sentence A Personal History of Outlawed Love and Sex

Amazon Independent Booksellers How did sex workers and people from the LGBT community push back against the societal stigma of AIDS? Tell us about the pioneers of the movement who helped bring about societal acceptance.
Change came through the efforts of pioneering individuals and grassroots groups. For instance, in my book I document the life of Selvi, one of the very first sex workers to be identified with HIV, back in 1986. She suffered [an] abusive marriage, years of selling sex to support herself and her young son, her HIV diagnosis and then long years of imprisonment because she was an HIV-infected sex worker.
Right until her death in 1998, Selvi was a tireless crusader, not only to keep other sex workers from contracting HIV but importantly also for far-reaching legal reform, beginning with decriminalization, in other words with getting the exploitative police out of their lives.
In 1993, you joined the health policy division of the World Bank as a policy analyst. You are very critical of the experience in your book.
Actually, I'm critical of much of what is called international development. Its failures are chronic and multitudinous. The blame for these failures spans all the way from both donor- and developing-country governments to Westerners who continue to think of poorer countries in damagingly sensationalistic terms, for instance as hotbeds of ""modern-day"" slavery.
But regarding the Bank, yes, I felt that in small ways and big, the institution's entitlements and power crippled its ability to promote well-being in the countries it worked in. It became clear to me on a firsthand basis from the public health projects that I worked on. Our reports were written from the best hotels.
Despite several visits to such countries as Kenya and Uganda, I knew next to nothing about them, feeling much like a rich first-world tourist gazing uncomprehendingly at ""third world"" sights from a cocoon of luxury.
What are the lessons that the global development community should never forget in the past four decades of battling HIV/AIDS?
One critical lesson is to pay heed to data and other forms of empirical knowledge.
In the case of India's sex workers, for instance, a wealth of data shows that today only 1 in 10 ever work in a brothel. Instead, the overwhelming majority operates from their homes or small lodges, often using mobile phones. Yet, in the popular Western imagination, all of India's sex workers work in the heinous conditions of Mumbai's brothels of the 1980s.
And there is a pointed lesson about humility. The West simply does not hold all the answers and have all the knowledge. It speaks volumes that U.S. government policies on AIDS, sexual rights and reproductive rights have more often than not put destructive moralizing before humanitarian and social justice imperatives [for example, groups worldwide receiving U.S. funding were barred from discussing condom use with young people and many adults, with the exception of ""those who practice high-risk behaviors].
The title of your book refers to an ""indefinite sentence."" But now that Section 377 has been abolished, what does the title mean to you?
The indefinite sentence is indeed lifting now for gay and trans individuals in India. But it continues for sex workers — and my motivation in writing this book was to draw attention to the terrible injustice done to them.
How did writing this book change you?
It changed me in more ways than I can count. There's a special kind of liberation that has come from being able to make clear sense of my life, to make sense of the needless harm that was done to me. I needed to be in my 50s to be able to see my life in this larger perspective.
Of course, only a portion of this book is about me — more than half is about the scores of women sex workers, gay men and trans women whom I've met over the decades. And getting to write a history of their remarkable lives and efforts, which have led to all kinds of progress in India, was equally transformative for me.

""I don't need to move to sell coca paste, the buyers come to me. It is easier than planting anything else.""
Fabiola Ferrero When Venezuelan photographer Fabiola Ferrero first traveled to the city of Florencia in Colombia, she took two instant cameras with her. Her goal: to portray a country in limbo between war and peace.
In 2016, the Colombian government and rebels from the country's largest guerrilla group signed an agreement to end half a century of war. Though a clear path to sustainable peace is still to come.

Fabiola Ferrero Ferrero traveled to Florencia, in southwestern Colombia's Caquetá department, in April 2017. Caquetá has been a key location for producing coca, the crop used for making cocaine, and has been hit hard by conflict. She stayed with a coca-growing family for a week.
Enlarge this image Ariel Ramos and his family pose for a portrait outside their home in Zabaleta, Colombia. Fabiola Ferrero Fabiola Ferrero Ariel Ramos and his family pose for a portrait outside their home in Zabaleta, Colombia.
Fabiola Ferrero Ferrero established a connection with the head of the family, a raspachín or coca farmer, and with his family. She asked them to visually convey — with paper and markers — what life is like and their idea of peace.

Fabiola Ferrero Fabiola Ferrero A drawing made by a coca farmer shows his memory of government airplanes destroying his fields in 2005 as part of Plan Colombia, a U.S.-funded program to counter drug trafficking and insurgency.
Fabiola Ferrero What resulted was a collaborative mixed-media project exploring the daily life of families that depend solely on income from growing coca. The project also touches on issues related to climate change and mental health in times of conflict.
Ferrero used two Fujifilm Instax cameras, an instant photography format that provides a sense of immediacy and the direct involvement of her subjects. They could interact, talk about their experiences, informally be photographed and keep the Polaroids for themselves. For a community that struggles with issues of justice, seeing and keeping the results of the interaction with Ferrero was meaningful.
The work that we see is a juxtaposition of the drawings made by the local families and a digitized version of her instant imagery, creating a mixed narrative and a visceral approach to visual storytelling. The work is not only aesthetically on point, but it also provides a direct connection with the characters in her story. They are the co-narrators of the story, and their point of view is as important as Ferrero's.

Fabiola Ferrero NPR caught up with Ferrero recently for a conversation about her work. The following are edited excerpts from the interview.
Instant photography is such a different approach to documentary storytelling. Why did you choose it for this work?
My idea was to photograph a short period of time, the days between a nation in conflict and a nation in peace. So the instant cameras contribute to the concept of a moment that will only exist briefly. I visited these areas right after the peace agreement was signed. The incomes of the Zabaleta community are based on coca plants. Almost all the families depend on this, and they were being asked to replace their crops but didn't have any reliable option to sustain their children. So, mixing the instant images taken by me and the drawings about their hopes and fears made by them was a way to portray a mental state of uncertainty, of limbo.

Fabiola Ferrero How was your approach and collaboration with the families and people you worked with in Colombia?
I lived with the family of one raspachín [coca harvester] for a week. I brought the instant cameras and a notebook for them to draw. Then I just talked to a lot of members of the community, and based on those interviews, I asked them if they wanted to visually explain something related either to the conflict they lived through or the peace they hoped for.
Enlarge this image Men watch a cockfight on a Friday night in Zabaleta. Fabiola Ferrero Fabiola Ferrero Men watch a cockfight on a Friday night in Zabaleta.
Fabiola Ferrero I also made portraits with the instant cameras for them to keep, and I would love to come back someday, when peace is finally a reality, and see those portraits in their houses.
This was made less than a year after the peace agreement was signed, and the amount of coca crops was at its highest point in decades. So, the mood was of both celebration and skepticism. I wanted to pay attention to coca farmers because the increase of coca crops was seen as the biggest threat to peace: Where there are drugs, there is usually violence. The farmers I met chose this path because it is paid better than other plantations. [Coca] is not as heavy as potatoes or corn, for instance, which would cost them money to transport, and they don't even need to transport anything, because secret buyers come to them personally and pick up the crop. They were also promised financial help to substitute their crops, but at that moment hadn't received it. These campesinos are not growing rich, quite the opposite: They barely have water access, for instance. It doesn't seem like it is a problem with a sustainable short-term solution. It involves deep structural reasons behind it.

Fabiola Ferrero How was their reaction? Was this a sort of reflective exercise whereby people could talk and narrate their experiences before, during and after the peace process?
Drawings were made individually; it wasn't a group exercise. They were very open to share their experiences, and my role was journalistic. I also visited a zona veredal of former FARC members [a normalization zone for ex-members of the rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia].
But the issue is more complex and a deeper insight was necessary, so I wrote quite an extensive article for a Colombian magazine. I actually studied investigative journalism (not photography), and I write a lot on my projects.

Fabiola Ferrero Did your notions of war and war in Colombia in particular change after this project? How did it affect you as a visual storyteller and photographer?
I always have the feeling that, no matter what I do, the work seems incomplete, because I am not the one experiencing their story, but I am the one who is telling it. This is not the conflict I grew up in, although now my family is based in Colombia and I travel back and forth between Venezuela and Colombia. So, in order to have the story narrated by the people, I asked them to draw.

Fabiola Ferrero For instance: Anyelis asked me if she could draw a land mine as soon as she saw the colors. She's a 7-year-old girl, and the daughter of the man who was hosting me. The conflict in Colombia has left more than 220,000 victims dead, but it involves more than those reached by a bullet, because it relates to how people change their perception of reality and their behaviors. It is the human adapting to horror in order to survive. Anyelis knows how to draw a land mine and what to do if she sees one, because they teach them that at school: It is tragedy becoming normal. The land mine on the paper was bigger than the man she drew next to it, and I don't think I can explain better than her that she knows this at 7 and I don't.
This was the first time I asked people to be part of the creative process, and since then I try to find ways to do it. I am currently working on a project with Magnum Foundation related to Venezuela's collapse and its diaspora, and it is based on collaborations.
How did it affect you as a Latin American?
Not so much affect, but teach. As a Venezuelan, I was coming to Colombia right after the protests started in [Venezuela's capital] Caracas in 2017. So I came with violent images in my head to a country that was very hopeful. Caracas was tear gas and people expressing anger, [the Colombian department of] Caquetá was dreaming of something better, although uncertain. To me, Colombia and Venezuela share something tragic, which is the experience of violence for long periods of time. In Venezuela we have one of the highest crime rates in the world, but the country next to us has had over five decades of armed conflict. And, by the way, our country has also been affected by it: A recent report says that ELN, the National Liberation Army, a leftist rebel group, is currently acting inside a large proportion of Venezuelan territory. So, this conflict, although reduced, should still matter, because violence is very much present in the rural areas, where 230 social leaders have been killed this year. There are still so many things changing in Colombia, and so many things to be told.

That people care more about Latin America. We have the new Brazilian president, the climate fight led by indigenous groups in the whole region, the increase of coca crops, the crisis in Venezuela and how it is moving to neighboring countries, the migration and violence in Central America. This all affects people beyond our borders, it is important and we should follow up on these stories.

"As Quidditch Grows, So Do Concerns Over Quidditch Injuries : NPR",www.npr.org,Amanda Morris,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/13/708111436/for-some-quidditch-players-the-magic-wears-off-as-injury-risks-grow-clearer,"Enlarge this image Quidditch is a fast-paced, co-ed, full-contact combination of dodgeball, rugby and basketball.

Above, John Sheridan tries to score points by throwing a quaffle ball through the other team's hoop.
Noah Fortson/NPR It happened in a split second, and Vanessa Barker doesn't remember any of it. She doesn't remember dropping to the field, nor does she remember how she got hit.
When she came to, she was sitting on the sidelines with an EMT, being evaluated for what turned out to be her first concussion. Over the next two years, she'd suffer another two more while out on the field — hardly what she expected when she decided to start playing quidditch.
Before 2005, quidditch existed only as a creation from the fictional world of Harry Potter — a pastime for witches and wizards on flying broomsticks. But charmed by the game's allure, students at Middlebury College in Vermont held the first real-life quidditch match, a fast-paced, co-ed, full-contact combination of dodgeball, rugby and basketball.
Enlarge this image Vanessa Barker of the University of Maryland has suffered three concussions while playing quidditch. Noah Fortson/NPR Noah Fortson/NPR Vanessa Barker of the University of Maryland has suffered three concussions while playing quidditch.
Noah Fortson/NPR Nearly a decade-and-a-half later, participation has grown dramatically, with teams sprouting up in communities and college campuses across the country. The sport has its own governing body, U.S. Quidditch, with 134 teams already registered this season and another five to 10 more added each year.
But as teams gather in Texas this weekend for U.S. Quidditch Cup championship, players, coaches and officials are increasingly grappling with how to minimize risk in a game where the potential for injury has become more and more apparent. Many have come to realize it's not just scrapes and bruises — it's also broken bones, and for players like Vanessa Barker, repeat concussions.
""If I ever have any others, I'll have to stop playing,"" she said.
The rules of quidditch Sports There May Not Be Flying, But Quidditch Still Creates Magic The real life game of quidditch is similar to the fictional sport, sans the flying broomsticks. To make up for that, players run with a piece of PVC pipe between their legs, sprinting up and down the field with as many as five balls in play at a time.
There are seven players to a team. Three ""chasers"" try to score a volleyball through hoops on both sides of the field, each set defended by the opposing team's ""keeper.""
Enlarge this image Just as with the rules of quidditch from the Harry Potter series, in real-life quidditch, once a seeker catches the snitch, the match is over. Noah Fortson/NPR Noah Fortson/NPR Just as with the rules of quidditch from the Harry Potter series, in real-life quidditch, once a seeker catches the snitch, the match is over.
Noah Fortson/NPR While the chasers focus on scoring, two ""beaters"" try to stop them by either tackling them or throwing dodgeballs at them. Meanwhile, a seventh player, the ""seeker,"" goes after the ultimate prize: the snitch. Once a seeker catches the snitch, the match is over.
Matches can be intense. Players run at full-speed without any required protective equipment other than a mouthguard. And because the game is co-ed, players of all gender are tackling each other.
Barker is a beater on the University of Maryland quidditch team. This means she often competes against other beaters to get the dodgeballs, or ""bludgers,"" that they use to heave at chasers. At 5 feet, 2 inches tall, she's the shortest person on her team. Male players sometimes tower a foot over her.
""I've gotten egregiously tackled many times, where they tackle me too hard for no reason,"" she said.
Barker said her second concussion happened when she was tackled by a 200-pound male during tryouts. She got another when a male beater hit her in the head with the bludger, but without letting the ball go, essentially punching her in the head.
On the field, Barker has seen a range of other injuries. During her freshman year, she said the president of her team broke his collarbone twice.
""I've seen broken thumbs, broken noses, broken collarbones,"" Barker said.
Studying injuries Amelia Gurley, a former quidditch player, has seen these types of injuries too — particularly as the sport has grown more competitive. A medical student at Brown University, Gurley is now trying to answer a fundamental question: how dangerous is quidditch really? In February, she began work on what she hopes to be the first international quidditch injury survey.

Noah Fortson/NPR ""I worry,"" she said. ""We're a new sport. No one's really even looking into this.""
To date, the most comprehensive data comes from a 2017 study by researchers at the University of Edinburgh who surveyed roughly 50 percent of all quidditch players in the United Kingdom.
The study revealed a mixed picture. While overall injury rates were no higher than in other recreational sports, concussions accounted for more than 20 percent of all injuries. That made concussions the second most common injury overall, according to Ashley Cooper, one of the study's authors. Sprains were the most common injury, at roughly 26 percent. Lacerations, at about 18 percent, were the third most common injury type.
The authors called the study's concussion numbers ""relatively high when compared to other full contact sports."" For comparison, the study noted that the concussion rate in professional rugby was between 3 percent and 10 percent of all injuries.

Above, players stretch during a quidditch practice at the University of Maryland.
Noah Fortson/NPR Men and women are injured at roughly the same rate, according to the study, but women experienced concussions at nearly double the rate as men.
There are still no studies of injuries in U.S. Quidditch, making it difficult to tell how safety compares in the U.S., where thousands play the game, and the U.K., where the number of players is estimated in the hundreds.
USQ declined to provide specific injury data, but Sarah Woolsey, its executive director, said the league was aware of the concussion risk and noted that medical personnel are required to be present at every official USQ game.
""Every single certified coach in our league is required to complete a concussion training webinar,"" Woolsey said. ""If any player is suspected of having a concussion ... they're immediately removed from play and cannot return to play unless they are cleared by a medical professional.""
Rethinking the rules For newcomers to quidditch, the physical nature of the game can be eye-opening.
""I thought it'd be a load of super fans with scars on their heads running around the field,"" said Cooper, referring to Harry Potter's trademark scar.
A quidditch player himself, Cooper said he got ""absolutely battered"" playing the game. ""I thought if it was contact it'd be these asthmatic nerds running around and it wasn't.""
Now, many players are starting to think more seriously about whether the rules of quidditch need to be reevaluated
One of the biggest debates in the sport is about tackling technique. USQ rules only allow one-armed tackles, but some players have begun to wonder whether two-arms would be safer.
""When you have the broom in one hand and you're trying to make a tackle, it makes it awkward, you have to twist or fall backwards and throw them over you,"" said Mack Morgan, a co-captain of the University of Maryland quidditch team. ""With a two hand tackle there's never really going to be that twisting motion.""
Morgan said that many of the injuries he sees on the field — like torn knee ligaments, broken collarbones and concussions — come from that twisting motion.
Woolsey declined to say whether USQ was considering two-armed tackles, but pointed out that USQ players are required to sign a waiver that states that quidditch is a full contact sport.
Another topic of debate is the co-ed nature of the game and whether it's safe for differently gendered people to be tackling one another — not only because players don't wear protective padding, but also because of the size differences between players.
""One of the parts of the rules deals with reckless or excessive force,"" Woolsey said. ""Our athletes understand it might take a different amount of force to tackle somebody who is smaller versus somebody who is bigger.""
Many players say they'd be reluctant to eliminate co-ed play. Many say they were drawn to the sport because of how inclusive it is for people of all genders, including those who identify as nonbinary.
""It's nice being able to play sports with people of all genders and all backgrounds,"" Gurley said.

Noah Fortson/NPR Noah Fortson/NPR University of Maryland quidditch co-captain and chaser/keeper Mack Morgan catches his breath after a competitive team scrimmage.
Noah Fortson/NPR Rules are typically updated every year, Woolsey said, based on feedback from players and internal data about injuries gathered at every official USQ game.
She said she thinks quidditch is approaching a point where the rules are more permanent, but will still probably change a bit.
""Even sports that have been around for over a hundred years make changes,"" she said.
Enlarge this image Members of the University of Maryland quidditch team gather at the end of a recent practice.

Though research is limited, some who play the game are starting to think more seriously about whether the rules of the sport need to be reevaluated.
Noah Fortson/NPR But as Gurley from Brown University pointed out, there are still many quidditch teams across the country that are not affiliated with USQ. So even if USQ were to make changes, those would not necessarily have any impact for players on non-USQ teams.
Gurley's former team, the Providence Ashwinders, is not an official USQ team, so it doesn't need to abide by USQ regulations. Once, she remembers a game that her team played where an EMT was not present until halfway through the tournament.
""Different people in different places are playing quidditch differently, which can be great,"" Gurley said. ""But it can also be dangerous when it comes to things like safety ... We're not wizards. We can't fix that kind of stuff with a wave of our wands."""
How Shrinking Newsrooms Impact Local Politics,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/13/712997066/how-shrinking-newsrooms-impact-local-politics,"How Shrinking Newsrooms Impact Local Politics How Shrinking Newsrooms Impact Local Politics Embed Embed
A study in Urban Affairs Review found shrinking newsrooms can potentially impact the number of candidates who run for mayor. NPR's Scott Simon talks to professor Meghan Rubado, co-author of the study.
SCOTT SIMON, HOST:
When local newspapers shrink, local communities pay the price. Research has shown that smaller newsrooms result in the scrutiny of government, lower voter turnout - and now, according to a new study, potentially fewer people who run for mayor. What are the implications of that? Meghan Rubado, a professor at Cleveland State University and a former journalist, co-authored the new study in Urban Affairs Review. She joins us from the studios of WCPN in Cleveland. Professor, thanks so much for being with us.
MEGHAN RUBADO: Thanks for having me.
SIMON: I gather you saw this firsthand in Syracuse when you were a city hall reporter.
RUBADO: That's right. So I was a reporter at the Syracuse Post-Standard from about 2004 to 2010, and that was really during the worst, the most precipitous decline in newsroom staffing levels. So I witnessed a lot of that decline.
SIMON: And how did that translate to fewer people running for mayor, though?
RUBADO: Our theory is that when people know less about what their public officials are up to, quality challengers are less likely to emerge. So people have to know that a mayor or a councilor or a school board member is not doing a good job in order to sort of get up the nerve or the interest to challenge them in the next election.
SIMON: This study looked at, I gather, 11 newspapers in California, right?
RUBADO: That's right.
SIMON: And what did you find?
RUBADO: So we connected these newspapers to all the municipalities that they serve and examined their mayoral elections over a period of 20 years. And so what we see is that as that decline happened, newspapers that more dramatically cut their staff suffered sort of objectively negative political outcomes - fewer candidates running for mayor, largery (ph) victory margins for the winners and more incumbent-only races. Additionally, we saw some suggestive evidence that voter turnout declined under these conditions of more loss of news staff.
SIMON: And how do you react to the argument, well, more candidates don't necessarily mean better candidates?
RUBADO: Well, of course they don't always mean better candidates. But I think when voters don't have a choice - right? - and that's sort of what we're seeing. We're seeing that this decline tends to result in the difference between having an option and not having an option. I think it challenges the incumbent mayor, even if the candidate who's running against them is unlikely to win. If they feel any kind of threat to their job, they're more likely to feel that electoral connection to the voters and serve them better, represent them better.
SIMON: We do note there was a mayoral election there in Cleveland in 2017. The town has just one newspaper, which is cutting staff.
RUBADO: Yes, indeed.
SIMON: Mayor Frank Jackson was re-elected to a fourth term, but there were 11 candidates on the ballot. So how does that conform with your findings?
RUBADO: Right. So we looked at not just central cities, but the cities that surround the central city, as well. So while we might see these large numbers of candidates continuing to run in the central cities, still, we would expect that number to be higher and to be higher with quality challengers if the newspaper is doing a really good job of covering local politics. In the outlying cities in the first-ring suburbs and the outer suburbs, we expect this is more likely to be the difference between having a challenger and not having a challenger - having two people running versus one or maybe three versus one or two.
SIMON: And this has to do with the quality of democracy, doesn't it?
RUBADO: It definitely does. So the things that we observe - this reduced political competition, reduced voter engagement - when these conditions exist, it means that our elected officials are less tied to the voters. They're held less accountable. And if that's the case, there's lots of concern about what happens under those conditions - more corruption, less representation of voters, less effective governance.

President Trump said he is considering sending detained immigrants in the country illegally to ""sanctuary cities."" Scott Simon gets reaction from Mayor Libby Schaaf of Oakland, a ""sanctuary city.""
SCOTT SIMON, HOST:
Could detained migrants be moved into places that call themselves sanctuary cities? President Trump says he's strongly considering the idea, placing apprehended migrants in cities that have declared themselves sanctuaries. That is cities that limit their cooperation with federal immigration officials. President Trump said in a tweet, the radical left always seems to have an open borders, open arms policy, so this should make them very happy. Libby Schaaf is the mayor of Oakland, Calif., a sanctuary city. Mayor Schaaf, thanks so much for being with us.
LIBBY SCHAAF: Oh, thanks for having me.
SIMON: Do you welcome this chance for Oakland to welcome migrants?
SCHAAF: Listen. Oakland is a city that prides itself on diversity and inclusion. We are proud of the immigrant community that we have right now. And it's our job to not build walls but build bridges and welcome all people and celebrate the richness that diverse cultures bring to our city. We also know that immigrants actually make a safer city, despite the lies and the divisive rhetoric that this president continues to drive to separate the American people. We know that data proves that undocumented or documented immigrants commit far fewer crimes. So not only is our community richer and more loving. But it also is safer because we are a sanctuary city and a diverse city.
SIMON: But let me hone this down to the point that's at issue now. If sometime, let's say, in the middle of next week, a number of buses arrive in Oakland with 5,000 migrants, do you say, welcome to Oakland?
SCHAAF: I always say, welcome to Oakland. But this is much less about immigration or sanctuary. This is about an outrageous abuse of power. The idea that you could use human beings, families as instruments of political payback to use public resources to exact retribution on your political enemies. This is not America. It is not democratic. And this is what should outrage all Americans, regardless of their stance on immigration or sanctuary cities.
SIMON: I've gotten two very complete answers from you to essentially the question, would you welcome more migrants? I haven't heard a yes.
SCHAAF: I said yes. Oakland welcomes all people.
SIMON: So specifically in this case, if more migrants show up, that's fine with you?
SCHAAF: My job as a mayor is to welcome people. I don't build walls. It's our job to welcome everyone into our city, ensure their safety, ensure that their families can thrive. And that is my job no matter where those people came from or how they got there.
SIMON: Do you think the president is testing the sincerity of liberal Democrats?
SCHAAF: I think the president is trying to whip up his base. He's trying to continue to drive lies, racist lies about immigrants. And he's trying to distract from the fact that his cutting of aid to countries that now have conditions that force families to flee and seek political asylum in our country - the fact that he's not addressing some of the pressing problems that are within America and tries to distract the public with this hate-mongering - that is the biggest problem.
SIMON: Would, let's say, a thousand more immigrants greatly tax the resources of Oakland?
SCHAAF: Oakland is growing very quickly. And we welcome families. We welcome people that seek to make better lives for their families, that are willing to work hard and become wonderful members of our community.
SIMON: Mayor Libby Schaaf of Oakland, thanks so much for being with us.
SCHAAF: Thank you. Copyright © 2019 NPR. All rights reserved. Visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.

SIMON: I love that. Yes, exactly.
BRYANT: We also want to know if the Boston Celtics can turn their disastrous season on - I mean, I know winning 49 games is not really disastrous, but still. They were supposed to be in Milwaukee, in the Warriors' class, but they weren't. I think it's going to be interesting, also, to see what the Philadelphia 76ers do and also those Toronto Raptors, who were flustered by LeBron all those years. But now they've got Kawhi Leonard, and LeBron's not here. So I think that the postseason's going to be really interesting.
SIMON: Two great players and classy guys - Dwyane Wade of the Miami Heat, Dirk Nowitzki of the Dallas Mavericks - have played their last game. How should we remember their careers?
BRYANT: Great, great players, and I think that this is - I'm an '80s guy, of course. And I think when you look at the number of Hall of Famers that came out of that decade, I think that the numbers still show it was a pretty amazing decade. But this is a golden age, as well. I think that looking at Dirk and Dwyane Wade - met for a championship twice - in 2006, with the Heat winning that one, although I think Dallas should've won that one; and then, of course, in 2011 when - LeBron's first year in Miami - Dallas winning that one when, of course, people thought Miami should've won that one.
So two phenomenal players - lovely that Dirk played 21 years with one team, which you don't really see anymore. And I think that both of these guys are going to be remembered as the icons for their cities that they were - and also, Dirk, especially, in terms of growing the international game - coming in from Germany; changing the perception, in a lot of ways, of what European players could be; and also, really immersing himself in the culture in Dallas. He's the greatest player they've had.
SIMON: Come into the studio this morning - Stu Rushfield, our technical director, has a scrap of west - wastepaper on our...
BRYANT: (Laughter).
SIMON: ...On my reading stand showing the New York - and can't - Mets - thought they played basketball - in first place. The Cubs - well, not doing well, although they beat the Angels last night. What's going on? The standings seem upside-down.
BRYANT: Yeah, what's up with your ball club, Scott Simon? The Cubs are a really interesting team because I think when they won it in 2016, I think people were expecting a long run of success. And now Joe Maddon didn't get his extension, so you're starting to wonder what is - what his future's going to be.
I think when you're looking at the Mets, obviously, they're 9-4. They're in first place and ahead of the Phillies by a game. I think the Red Sox, the defending world champions in the crazy American League East - there's only one team in that division that has a winning record, and it is the Tampa Bay Rays. The Yankees don't have any players right now.
I think it's fascinating. It's - and it's good. This is one of the things that makes baseball different. It's a sprint up - it's not a sprint. It's a marathon. It's going to take a long time. You're starting to wonder, do these teams have what it takes to just be there? Even at the All-Star break, what are they built for? But when you start the season, it is kind of interesting that the San Diego Padres are in first place. It's not what we're used to.

Julie Rovner, chief Washington correspondent for Kaiser Health News, describes the latest Medicare-for-all bill by Sen. Bernie Sanders and the options for single-payer coverage proposed by lawmakers.
SCOTT SIMON, HOST:
Bernie Sanders has introduced a new version of his ""Medicare for All"" bill that was a cornerstone of his 2016 presidential campaign. He's one of several Democratic candidates for president who support some form of national single-payer coverage. But is that easier said than done? Julie Rovner, chief Washington correspondent for Kaiser Health News joins us. Julie, thanks for being with us.
JULIE ROVNER: Thanks for having me.
SIMON: And what's Senator Sanders proposing this year?
ROVNER: Well, he's proposing similar to what he's been proposing since the 1990s, which is basically to make Medicare, the program that now serves 50-some million elderly and disabled Americans, available to everyone and basically get rid of private health insurance at the same time. So everyone would be on Medicare - might not be the same Medicare that we know now, but they would be on a federal government-run program called Medicare that would provide much more robust benefits than most people have now either on Medicare or on their private insurance.
SIMON: More robust benefits, but would that also mean more robust taxes?
ROVNER: Yes, it almost certainly would because there would be no more private health insurance premiums, according to the - at least the proposal that we have. People wouldn't have to pay copays or coinsurance or deductibles or, you know, the money that now gets paid out of pocket. So taxes would presumably go up to make up for that.
SIMON: A lot of Democratic candidates are running on a policy of Medicare for All. What are some of the features of the plans that we might find worth knowing about?
ROVNER: Well, the Medicare for All plans would basically get rid of private insurance, and this is of some concern for those who are worried about the political prospects. There's 150 million people who get their insurance from a family member's employer. That would basically go away. The entire private insurance industry would go away.
There are some other proposals that would either maintain a role for private insurance - maybe they could cover some things. That's how some countries do it. And then there are others that make the whole thing optional. The people who wanted to go into a public plan could go into a public plan, but those who wanted to keep their private coverage could do that. That's one of the big debates that's going to have to happen before anybody settles on any particular plan.
SIMON: And everybody seems to want to bring down health care costs, but there's a big but, isn't there?
ROVNER: There is a big but. You know, we are still a free country. If they bring them down too much, you might have providers who wouldn't want to participate, or you might have hospitals closing their doors.
I mean, at some point, yes, health care is expensive. It doesn't have to be as expensive as it is in the United States. We pay way more for things than other countries do, but there is going to be some kind of a limit on how low you can push those prices. But remember, however much you pay for the health care, that's how much is going to have to be then raised in federal taxes to pay for this.
SIMON: Any chance of Republican support for any of these plans?
ROVNER: It seems highly unlikely, at least at this point. This is mostly a Democratic debate about, what do Democrats think the nation's health care should look like in the coming years and probably decades? Republicans are still kind of figuring out exactly what they would like to propose. Everybody seems to support more coverage, and they know that the status quo isn't working. People are paying too much, and even middle-class people often can't afford their health care. But Republicans are - seem, at the moment, happy to call this socialism and leave it at that.
SIMON: If there is an overhaul of health care, but it's not bipartisan, does that just mean that American health care is going to go back and forth, depending on which party's in power?
ROVNER: Well, that is the big concern. And there are a lot of Republicans who are saying, you know, we really should work together. And there is some bipartisanship going on now on issues like prescription drug prices and surprise medical bills - that people get unexpected out-of-network bills. But even those are proving difficult to find bipartisan consensus on - at least enough consensus to pass a law. So I think both sides know it would be better if they got together. They just haven't figured out how yet.
SIMON: Julie Rovner, chief Washington correspondent for Kaiser Health News. Thanks so much.

Young Israeli voters turned out for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in elections this week, highlighting the right-wing trends among those who were raised in a time without much hope for peace.
SCOTT SIMON, HOST:
Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu won his fourth consecutive term this week. Many of his supporters are newcomers to Israel's politics. They're young voters who, surveys show, identify with Israel's right wing. NPR's Daniel Estrin met some of them on Election Day.
DANIEL ESTRIN, BYLINE: I walk into a polling station and find a 19-year-old and two 20-year-olds sitting at a table, assisting voters and cracking open sunflower seeds between their teeth. They're soldiers, like most of their peers. It was the first time they were old enough to vote. All three voted for Benjamin ""Bibi"" Netanyahu.
MAOR: Only Bibi 'cause he's the best.
ESTRIN: 20-year-old paratrooper Maor. He and the other soldiers I spoke to withheld their last names because the army doesn't let them give interviews without permission.
MAOR: He keep my family safe, of course.
ESTRIN: Nineteen-year-old infantry soldier Avi.
AVI: (Through interpreter) I voted for Bibi because he's given me a good sense of security and out of the fear that another prime minister could lead us to a worse situation or a better situation. You don't know who you're going to fall upon.
ESTRIN: Twenty-year-old Roni serves in a civilian protection unit in the army.
RONI: His relationships with the world, the way that he got Trump to get on board with Israel, Russia, China, everybody is amazing. Like, nobody has ever done this before.
ESTRIN: Israel's attorney general is preparing criminal charges against Netanyahu for his alleged bribes and backroom dealings with businessmen. It doesn't bother these young soldiers.
RONI: I don't care if he's getting presents, if he's helping his friends. He's a good prime minister.
ESTRIN: They don't remember much of anyone else. Netanyahu has been prime minister for a decade - since these soldiers were 9 and 10 years old. In a recent survey, the majority of 18 to 24-year-olds supported Netanyahu over his centrist rival. About 75 percent of them defined themselves as right or moderately right-wing. Those who call themselves left or moderate left-wing - only 9 percent. The soldiers I met don't think there will ever be peace with the Palestinians.
RONI: I think that it's very simple. We both want the same thing. They want Jerusalem. We want Jerusalem. They want to have a country, but they want it on our land. Just like two babies wanting the same candy, one will get it. One won't. We got it. There's never going to be peace. We want the same thing. They're never going to back down, and we're never going to back down.
ESTRIN: How about sharing it?
RONI: Sharing it - I think that they'll be a disgrace for the soldiers that died protecting this country.
ESTRIN: Palestinians say they feel the same way about the blood they've spilled, and they want a state like Israel has. These young Israelis mostly remember periods of violence.
YOHANAN PLESNER: Young Israelis grew into this reality, so they do not even have - cannot imagine another option.
ESTRIN: Yohanan Plesner is with the Israel Democracy Institute, which conducted the surveys of Israeli youth. He says when he was their age in the 1990s, Israel and the Palestinians negotiated the Oslo Peace Accords, and there was optimism about creating a Palestinian state next to Israel.
PLESNER: Older Israelis - while many of them are still skeptical, they still hold on to the view that separation between Israelis and the Palestinians is a desired strategy. The youngsters do not know any other reality. This is one of the reasons that it causes them to identify as right-wing.
ESTRIN: He says Israeli history shows that views do change when reality changes, like when Israelis rallied around the 1979 peace deal with Egypt. He thinks if there were a real possibility of peace with the Palestinians, these young soldiers' minds might change. Daniel Estrin, NPR News, Jerusalem. Copyright © 2019 NPR. All rights reserved.

More Possible Graves Found At Florida School,www.npr.org,Greg Allen,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/13/712997030/more-possible-graves-found-at-florida-school,"More Possible Graves Found At Florida School More Possible Graves Found At Florida School Embed Embed
Workers doing cleanup at a now-closed reform school in Florida have found 27 sites that may be unmarked graves. Researchers previously found more than 50 graves of boys who died at the school.
SCOTT SIMON, HOST:
Workers have made a grisly discovery at a defunct reform school in Florida - 27 sites that may hold graves. The find isn't totally unexpected. Several years ago, researchers unearthed more than 50 unmarked graves that contained the remains of boys who died at the notorious Dozier School. NPR's Greg Allen has more.
GREG ALLEN, BYLINE: Over the decades, until it closed in 2011, a series of investigations at the Dozier School found that boys - some as young as 6 and 7 - were subjected to harsh treatment that sometimes included severe beatings.
JERRY COOPER: These people were not right in the mind. I'm sorry.
ALLEN: Jerry Cooper is one of a group of men who, as boys, were held at the Dozier School. They've been outspoken about the abuse they received in a small white building on the school campus. The White House Boys, as they became known, believed that some children died from the abuse and were buried in unmarked graves at the school. Their accounts led a team of researchers from the University of South Florida to begin a search that eventually recovered the remains of 51 individuals.
That closed the book on the search for graves at the Dozier School until recently, when a company began working near the spot where the graves were found, an area known as Boot Hill. Using ground-penetrating radar, workers found 27 anomalies - sites, they concluded, that could be graves. Jerry Cooper, one of the White House Boys, says it confirms what his members have long been saying.
COOPER: We have, on a list, a total of 183 boys that cannot be accounted for, sir. I'm not surprised at all.
ALLEN: The survey of the area was conducted last year, and the report of the additional possible gravesites was filed in January. The information became public this week when Florida Governor Ron DeSantis sent a letter to officials in Jackson County, which now owns the site. DeSantis is asking the county to work with state agencies to handle the site, quote, ""with the utmost sensitivity and care."" Cooper has looked at the consultant's report on the anomalies. He says to him, they look like graves.
COOPER: Some of them are very shallow, which tells me this is a repeat of Boot Hill because we had a lot of shallow graves at Boot Hill - what we call hasty burials.
ALLEN: The work at the old Dozier School is going on as part of Jackson County's plan to redevelop the site. Deciding what to do about these and any additional graves found on the site may slow that down. County officials say they'll work with the governor to address all concerns. Cooper believes the state, as a former owner of the school, should take charge of determining how many boys died there and where they're buried. Greg Allen, NPR News.

President Omar al-Bashir was ousted from power. A transitional government will now run the country for two years. NPR's Scott Simon speaks with Ahmed Soliman of Chatham House about what's next.
SCOTT SIMON, HOST:
The head of Sudan's transitional government said today he was canceling a night curfew. He also ordered the release of all prisoners who'd been jailed under emergency laws by ousted President Omar al-Bashir. Al-Bashir was overthrown this week by the military after months of protests across the country. We spoke with Ahmed Soliman, a Horn of Africa research fellow at Chatham House in London, who says the fast-moving situation has taken everyone by surprise.
AHMED SOLIMAN: The protesters remain on the streets. They remain camped outside the army headquarters in Khartoum in large numbers - in the thousands.
There are rapid developments. I mean, even since yesterday, the new head of the military council that was announced, Awad Ibn Auf, former defense minister and vice president of Sudan who had ousted President Bashir, has himself been replaced, largely because of the demands on the street, but also due to internal rifts within the military and the armed forces. He has been replaced by the commander of the ground forces, Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, who is seen as somebody who is not as politicized as Ibn Auf was.
And ultimately, the protesters in the street are calling for a civilian-led administration and want to keep the pressure on for the military to hand over and provide a short-term timeline to moving towards a popular-led administration.
SIMON: Al-Bashir was in power for three decades. What was there, you believe, about this particular moment that led the generals to get rid of him?
SOLIMAN: Well, we've had a full month of sustained attritional protest in Sudan, which has ebbed and flowed. There was a large anniversary last week where thousands more protesters came out onto the streets to celebrate the downfall of the Nimeiri regime in '85. And they got the military headquarters as a focal point for their protests. And this has really ramped up the pressure. This is a stone's throw away from the presidential palace. And, really, the demands were being heard in real time.
The focal point of the military headquarters made a real difference in changing the generals and the top of the army's mindsets, particularly as it was dividing the ranks of the army with the middle-ranked officers supporting the protesters and defending them from being removed.
SIMON: Al-Bashir is wanted by the International Criminal Court. He's accused of organizing war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Darfur region. Is it possible he'll be extradited and have to stand trial?
SOLIMAN: Well, the current military government of yesterday - the transition came out with an explicit statement under Ibn Auf that he would be tried domestically. He would not be extradited. This would be a process for the judicial courts in Sudan. He was clear on that.
Since then, we have a new general of the transitional military council, General Burhan. And we're awaiting his statement as to whether or not there'll be any changes in the approach taken by the military council. Otherwise, I'm sure there'll be some leverage placed by the international community to try and change that decision. Of course, many Sudanese will be unhappy if Bashir and some of his allies are given a soft landing.
SIMON: Do you see protests continuing?
SOLIMAN: Protests are likely to continue. And actually, the Sudanese Professional Association (ph) are calling for reinforcements for people to move to the military headquarters to prevent the national intelligence and Rapid Support Force militias removing them forcibly.
SIMON: Ahmed Soliman, research fellow at Chatham House in London, thanks so much for being with us.
SOLIMAN: My pleasure. Copyright © 2019 NPR. All rights reserved. Visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.

NPR's Scott Simon asks Erin Lee Carr about her father, journalist David Carr, and her memoir, All That You Leave Behind.
SCOTT SIMON, HOST:
David Carr was an extraordinary reporter, but his best story may have been his own. He battled back from cocaine and crack addiction and a life on the street to become a celebrated columnist at The New York Times and, more crucially, a devoted father. David Carr collapsed in the newsroom one night in 2015 and died at the height of his fame and creative powers at the age of 58, leaving readers and his family in mourning.
Erin Lee Carr, documentary filmmaker, has put together a memoir of the father she cherished and her own struggles with some of the same demons he had wrestled. She's called her memoir ""All That You Leave Behind."" Erin Lee Carr joins us from New York. Thanks so much for being with us.
ERIN LEE CARR: Hi. So great to be here.
SIMON: If I could, I'd like to begin with that moment in your childhood. I believe you were 8 years old. Your father was going to take you and your friend Alex (ph) to McDonald's. What happened?
CARR: So I write about in the book that I was not an especially cool kid. I don't know if that's irregular for NPR listeners, but (laughter)...
SIMON: This is not the way to begin a healthful relationship, Ms. Carr, but go ahead.
CARR: Just teasing. But - so did not have a lot of friends, was super excited that I finally made a friend. And she was even - you know, she was ready to come over to the house. And so upstairs in my room, the one that I shared with my twin sister, I explained that, you know, my parents were drug addicts and that I didn't live with my mom, but I live with my dad. And so when my dad offered to take us to McDonald's, she said, you know, I'm not getting in the car with you because she was taught by her family that drug addicts are bad.
SIMON: Well, and tell us what he said to you and your sister Meagan, because it's, to say the least, a family conversation that's unique.
CARR: He talked about his former life as a drug addict, specifically crack. And I didn't really understand what that meant, but, you know, one of the things that I took away from the conversation - what I remember, you know, thinking about was you have to be careful about who you tell your story to. It's not something to be traded for affection. It's not private, but it's not public. He had yet to write his book, ""The Night Of The Gun.""
SIMON: I have thought in my mind if there's a nice way to phrase this, and I'm afraid I can't, so let me try anyway, OK? Addiction damn near killed your mother and your father, and it damn near ruined the lives of you and your sister. Wasn't that enough to warn you away from drinking?
CARR: I think it's a good question. I think that there's, one, a genetic component to this. But the first time I tried cocaine, it really felt like a part of my DNA had been completed. And later, I realized because that's how my life started. That would make complete sense.
So what I can offer you is what I learned about my dad through what he told me, through ""The Night Of The Gun"" - it did stop me at certain moments from really developing the addiction into something that was like his. Like, I was really lucky that not only was there this really intense example of what addiction looked like, there was what sobriety looked like. You know, for me, I need to be very clear that for the majority of my life, my father was a sober man.
SIMON: You talk in the book - you did find sobriety hard.
CARR: Yes. I mean, the first year was - I mean, I only - basically, I only got to nine months my first bout of sobriety. And so then I drank again. And within a couple of months, something terrible happened.
SIMON: Yeah.
CARR: And I remember that my sister was like, this is - you have to tell dad now. And as is our way, I sent him an email saying that I had drank again. And he said, I am in your corner. And then he died.
SIMON: You sent your father text messages after he died. Do you remember what you said?
CARR: It's a little strange. It's like I just wanted to - I wanted to talk to him even though I knew he wouldn't talk back. And, like, I used to send him emails. And just the other day, the book was coming out, and I cc'd him because I don't - that seemed like a...
SIMON: Wow.
CARR: ...Not a crazy thing to do. And the email bounced back. I was like, this is upsetting.
SIMON: Oh, my gosh. I think we all know what that's like, though.
CARR: Yeah. I just wanted - I wanted to - him feel like he's a part of it. And I think that there's a lot of people that don't believe in an afterlife. But, like, we are, you know, a religious crew. You know, to think that he is around in whatever presence exists is comforting.
SIMON: The book winds up with, things I learned from David Carr, a list. Could I ask you to read five or six that I noticed from there?
CARR: Of course. So these are things I learned from David Carr, a list. (Reading) Be grateful for the things you have in this life. You are lucky. Practice patience, even though it's one of the hardest things to master. Failure is a part of the process, maybe the most important part. Alcohol is not a necessary component of life. Street hot dogs are not your friend. Remind yourself that nobody said this would be easy.
SIMON: Erin Lee Carr - her memoir, ""All That You Leave Behind"" - thanks so much for being with us.
CARR: Thank you so much. Copyright © 2019 NPR. All rights reserved. Visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.

Dervish Finds New Ways To Celebrate Tradition With 'The Great Irish Songbook',www.npr.org,Scott Simon,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/13/712813481/dervish-finds-new-ways-to-celebrate-tradition-with-the-great-irish-songbook,"Enlarge this image Dervish's latest album Irish Songbook is out now. Colin Gillen/Courtesy of the artist Colin Gillen/Courtesy of the artist Dervish's latest album Irish Songbook is out now.
Colin Gillen/Courtesy of the artist For the past three decades, Dervish has been at the forefront of reinventing traditional Irish folk songs. The Sligo-based band is ""breathing new life"" into the beloved music of its homeland with The Great Irish Songbook , an album pulling from an eclectic range of genres and the voices of over a dozen featured artists.
Collaborators on the album include Steve Earle , David Gray and Rhiannon Giddens and this project encompasses everything from traditional dance music to love ballads, including a W.B. Yeats-penned serenade ""Down by the Sally Gardens"" and the classic ""The Rocky Road to Dublin.""
The Great Irish Songbook is out now. Founding Dervish member Shane Mitchell and longtime vocalist Cathy Jordan spoke with NPR's Scott Simon about the band's unlikely beginnings, the soul of Irish music and the making of The Great Irish Songbook . Hear the radio version of their conversation in the audio link and read on for interview highlights.
Interview Highlights On the origin of Dervish
Mitchell : We basically were a group of friends that were growing up together. We were asked to make a recording of local music one time and we had to come up with a title for the album pretty quickly. And we were just called The Boys of Sligo.
Jordan : I wrecked it. [ Laughs ] They couldn't be The Boys of Sligo anymore!
It was about '91 when when I joined. I was, at that time, making cakes and making pastries in County Longford and singing on the weekends. I had known the guys for quite some time and they decided that it was time to get a singer and I decided that I was fed up making cakes. I hitchhiked down to Sligo with my rucksack on my back and never came back.
The Thistle & Shamrock The Thistle & Shamrock: Cathy Jordan at Swannanoa On why the Irish excel at songs about heartbreak
Jordan : The heartbreak, I guess, comes in many forms. It can come in immigration, leaving loved ones behind, of course, the affairs of the heart. We have far more songs about love unrequited than songs with happy endings, which I found [out] one time when I was asked to sing as somebody's wedding. They wanted a lovely traditional Irish ballad with a happy ending and I couldn't find one. There's usually somebody dead by the third verse and betrayed by the fourth or whatever. So, I'm not quite sure, there could be many reasons for it, but we have a few happy endings songs, you'll be delighted to know on The Great Irish Songbook.
On how beloved Irish music is around the globe
Mitchell : We continue to be surprised by how loved Irish music is. I suppose when we started this project nearly two years ago, the idea was to try and find people who had a love for Irish music from different genres of music. We found a lot of closet Irish folk music fans. In fact, we have enough to make three albums, somebody said at one stage.
I am so proud of our music, that there's so much love and people get emotionally attached to us. It's a very positive genre of music and this was one of the reasons why we looked at this project. These are iconic songs that we all grew up with. You know, Irish pub music, people come together and it was a great sense of camaraderie when people would sing together. We just think that this was a great way to approach an album — breathe new life into these wonderful old songs."

toggle caption Jeff Kinney/Amulet Books ""The first thing you need to know about me is that I am Greg Heffley's best friend,"" Rowley Jefferson writes in his journal. ""I know it says that on the cover but I wanted to mention it in case you missed that part.""
Jeff Kinney/Amulet Books When Jeff Kinney started working on Diary of a Wimpy Kid, he thought he was writing a comic for adults. ""I always thought of comics as being for grown-ups, or maybe just for everyone,"" he says. After eight years of work, he finally showed it to an editor and learned: ""I had actually written a children's series which was an absolute surprise to me.""
That ""surprise"" has now sold 180 million copies. There are 13 installments of Greg Heffley's diary and now, Greg's best friend Rowley Jefferson, is getting his own book — Diary of an Awesome Friendly Kid.
NPR's Backseat Book Club Gross-Out Gags AND Life Lessons In 'Wimpy Kid' Best friends get on each other's nerves and Greg can be pretty mean to Rowley. (Greg, after all, is a ""comically exaggerated version"" of the author — ""He's sort of based on the worst parts of myself,"" Kinney explains.)
But Rowley remains loyal to his best friend — his superpower is kindness, Kinney says, ""and that is a great superpower for today's day and age.""
Greg doesn't necessarily deserve a friend like Rowley, Kinney says, ""but he got one, so he's very lucky.""
Kinney also counts himself as being quite lucky, having landed his dream job.
""I always felt like I was burning to be a cartoonist — that's what I felt like I was born to do,"" he says. ""I pursued it for a long time, and I finally cracked it.""
Interview Highlights On Rowley and Greg experiencing childhood differently
[Greg is a] kid who's in a rush to grow up. ... He's a kid who wants to get to that next level. He wants his bedtime to be a later. He wants a cell phone. He wants to be able to see that PG-13 movie instead of PG and he doesn't realize what a good thing childhood is — what a good gig it is.
Rowley is really quite the opposite. He loves being a kid. He's not in a rush to grow up and ... he's very pure.
Book Reviews 'Wimpy Kid': A Hilarious Take On Middle School Life On people always rooting for Rowley
The thing that I've learned from the four [ Diary of a Wimpy Kid ] movies and from the musical that we put together is that the audience is always rooting for Rowley to win. And you know — as a person who Greg is based upon — I'm always like, why are they rooting for this guy? So I decided to embrace that. He's a really positive kid. He's really incorruptible in a way.
On writing for Rowley vs. Greg
It's sort of easy for me to write for Greg, and I wasn't so sure that I could write for this other character who was more naïve, and innocent, and positive. But I found it to be really refreshing.
Diary of an Awesome Friendly Kid Rowley Jefferson's Journal
by Jeff Kinney
Hardcover, 217 Diary of an Awesome Friendly Kid Subtitle Rowley Jefferson's Journal Author Jeff Kinney On what he's trying to teach kids through Greg's character
I'm really not trying to moralize to kids at all. I think Greg is sort of like a stand-up comedian who gets up on stage and talks about his own experiences but it's through the prism of weakness and human failing. He wouldn't be that interesting of a character if he was always heroic. ... Greg is always frowning on the covers of the books. I think he's more interesting because bad things happen to him. ... I know lots and lots of Gregs. I think we've all got a little bit of Greg in us.
On Diary of a Wimpy Kid starting out as a comic strip
I wanted to be a newspaper cartoonist. That was my goal: To be on the pages with ... [""Peanuts"" creator] Charles Schulz and [""Calvin and Hobbes"" creator] Bill Watterson and [""The Far Side"" creator] Gary Larson. That was my goal and I tried at it for a few years — for about three years tried hard, got nothing but rejections. And then I had the idea to get my comics into books which was really kind of different. Back then, there weren't a lot of books with comic strip DNA in them. So I wanted to invent something new. I worked on it for a long time. I worked on it for eight years before I showed it to anyone.
On running a bookstore
I have a bookstore called An Unlikely Story in Plainville, Massachusetts — and it's great. ... It's so fun to invite lots of different authors to the bookstore. We must have two or three nationally famous authors in our bookstore each week and I love to sit in the audience and learn from them.

Can This Breakfast Cereal Help Save The Planet?,www.npr.org,Dan Charles,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2019/04/13/711144729/can-this-breakfast-cereal-help-save-the-planet,"Enlarge this image A bowl of Honey Toasted Kernza. General Mills made 6,000 boxes of the cereal and is passing them out to spread the word about perennial grains. Olivia Sun/NPR Olivia Sun/NPR A bowl of Honey Toasted Kernza. General Mills made 6,000 boxes of the cereal and is passing them out to spread the word about perennial grains.
Olivia Sun/NPR This past week in San Francisco, food writers and environmentalists gathered to taste some breakfast cereal.
This particular cereal had an ingredient — the milled seeds of a little-known plant called Kernza — that's the result of a radical campaign to reinvent agriculture and reverse an environmentally disastrous choice made by our distant ancestors.
The campaign began 40-some years ago with a scientist-environmentalist named Wes Jackson . He argued that humanity took a wrong turn, thousands of years ago, when it came to rely on crops like wheat and rice for basic sustenance. These ""annual"" crops need replanting each year, ""which means that if you're going to get your seed to germinate, you've got to destroy the vegetation at the surface,"" clearing away anything that might compete with the fragile seedlings, Jackson said .
As farmers use tillage tools or herbicides to get rid of competing vegetation, they inevitably wipe away habitat for birds and insects. Bare soil washes away and pollutes streams and rivers. Tilling the soil releases vast amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.
Jackson imagined a totally different style of farming. And he founded a small organization called The Land Institute , in Salina, Kan., to pursue the dream.
Tim Crews , the institute's director of research, takes me on a little tour of the grounds at The Land Institute, and our first stop is a patch of native prairie. Crews gesture toward the carpet of grass, wildflowers and clover. ""This is the vegetation that actually builds soil. It's what created the rich soils that feed us, across the breadbasket of the Midwest,"" he says.
These plants don't require reseeding. Their roots go deep into the earth, live right through the winter, and send up fresh green stems every spring.
The Land Institute believes that we should be getting our staple foods from perennial plants like this. And they're feeling pretty excited at the Land Institute these days. They actually have some examples of grain from perennial plants to show off.
Plant breeder Lee DeHaan in a greenhouse at the Land Institute in Salina, Kan. These plants were created by cross-pollinating intermediate wheatgrass and regular wheat. Dan Charles/NPR Dan Charles/NPR The first is Kernza. The plant's real name is intermediate wheatgrass, but that struck people as kind of clunky, so they renamed it. It's a distant relative of regular wheat. It's never been grown as a grain crop because it doesn't produce nearly as much seed as wheat. But it is a perennial.
For the past 15 years, plant breeder Lee DeHaan has been cross-pollinating individual Kernza plants. He grows them in greenhouses and in open fields and selects the best offspring, paying particular attention to the size of the seeds they make. Bigger seeds means a bigger harvest to mill into flour.
He opens a paper bag to show me some recent results. ""As you can see, the seed is pretty small. It's about one-fifth the size of wheat,"" he says.
But he has been making progress. These seeds are twice as large as when the project started. The Land Institute has recruited farmers to grow Kernza in small fields (small for the Midwest, at least) of 40 acres or so. They're harvesting it with standard farm machinery.
The Salt After A Long Day Of Fighting Climate Change, This Grain Is Ready For A Beer DeHaan recalls the day, years ago, when he realized that Kernza might be more than a long-term scientific experiment. He was visiting a farmer who'd grown a field of Kernza. The farmer had just finished his wheat harvest, and DeHaan asked if he'd be willing to try to harvest the Kernza field with his combine. ""He was kind of skeptical, but he was willing to give it a shot,"" DeHaan recalls. ""I'm riding with him in the combine, and it's starting to fill up his bin in the back. He was almost giddy; he was starting to giggle about it. He couldn't believe it was working."" They ended up with almost a full semitrailer load of Kernza grain.
Even more remarkable: General Mills, the company that makes Cheerios and Wheaties, now says it wants to make cereal out of it.

Dan Charles/NPR Dan Charles/NPR Grain from intermediate wheatgrass, or Kernza. The Land Institute is recruiting farmers to grow larger quantities of the grain for General Mills.
Dan Charles/NPR ""I think the R&D team saw this lovely grain and thought, 'There is something we can do with it,' "" says Maria Carolina Comings, marketing director for General Mills' organic brand, Cascadian Farm.
In recent months, General Mills gathered up all the Kernza grain that it could find, milled it, and made 6,000 small boxes of cereal to hand out as samples — and at events like the one this week in San Francisco.
There's actually more regular wheat in this cereal than Kernza, and it looks and tastes kind of like Wheaties. It's pretty sweet.
But General Mills wants to market Kernza — eventually, when there's more of it available — as the first grain that grows like grass on the prairie, protecting the soil, taking carbon from the air and storing it in the earth.
""We want to scale this and be able to find it on any grocery store, sitting on the same shelves"" alongside every other cereal put out by General Mills' Cascadian Farm brand, Comings says. ""You can start to be part of the solution to climate change by eating a cereal, which is just so lovely.""
The Land Institute is recruiting farmers to grow larger quantities of Kernza, but they're telling people not to expect too much, too soon. ""Commercial production of Kernza in 2019 is akin to taking a car for a test drive when it's halfway down the assembly line,"" says Fred Iutzi , the institute's president. For one thing, Kernza produces small harvests right now — perhaps 500 pounds per acre. By comparison, the average U.S. field of wheat yields about 4,000 pounds per acre.
But long-term, the Land Institute also has grand ambitions. ""Our goal is not for it to be a small-scale, niche thing,"" says Lee DeHaan. ""We have landscape-scale problems,"" and to make a real impact, perennial grains need to cover the landscape."

We have a recap of the week in politics as President Trump talked immigration this week.
SCOTT SIMON, HOST:
President Trump turned up the heat on the immigration debate to scalding this week. Official after official in Department of Homeland Securities (ph) was shown the door. And the president said he is, quote, ""giving strong considerations to placing illegal immigrants in sanctuary cities only,"" unquote, and said bluntly it was political retribution directed at Democrats. NPR's Ron Elving joins us. Ron, thanks so much for being with us.
RON ELVING, BYLINE: Good to be with you, Scott.
SIMON: Sanctuary cities - cities where local law enforcements decided that they'll limit cooperation with federal immigration officials. Is this threatened mass migration into sanctuary cities even legally or technically possible?
ELVING: Hard to imagine it could be, Scott. And, you know, Homeland Security officials had been denying this idea was really under consideration right up until the president said he was still thinking about it. So it was much like the way he threatened to close the border earlier this month, then said he'd wait a year, then said he was still thinking about doing that, too. So look. In all likelihood, the president does know that these are just rhetorical devices. But he sees how they dominate the discussion. And they reassure anyone who might have doubted this president will go on trying to win his border crisis with ever more extreme measures to punish the migrants and their defenders.
SIMON: What do you think the shake-up in leadership at the depart - by the Department of Homeland Security indicates? I mean, there are more acting - there's more acting - people with the title acting in it than at the, you know, actors studio in New York.
ELVING: Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen resigned under pressure. The undersecretary for management resigned. Trump also removed the Secret Service director. Acting is, as you suggest, now the first word in the title for much of the cabinet, too. And that's far from ideal for those officials or for the government. But they also do not have to go before the Senate for confirmation hearings or to answer questions. And that's a trade-off that the president apparently likes.
SIMON: We didn't get the Mueller report this week, redacted or otherwise, but Attorney General Barr still managed to keep his name in the news.
ELVING: An extraordinary performance in front of the House Judiciary Committee one day, followed by a truly stunning one in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee the next. The attorney general said spying occurred on the Trump campaign in 2016, but offered no indication of why he thought so or who might have done it and then said it was possible there was reason for surveillance, but he hadn't gotten all the information yet. So Barr is supposed to be the steady hand here. He's a veteran. He's been attorney general before. So it was amazing to hear him make such statements without having that information.
SIMON: We'll note Treasury Department now says that, for the moment, it won't comply with congressional requests to hand over President Trump's tax returns. And Julian Assange, arrested after Ecuador turned him out of their embassy in London. For those who worried, and I was among them, his cat was apparently resettled last year in a more conventional home. President Trump was once a big fan of Julian Assange's, wasn't he?
ELVING: Said he was. Trump repeatedly said, I love WikiLeaks at his rallies during the campaign. That was when Assange was involved in hacking the Democrats' national committee and the Hillary Clinton campaign and so on. Now the immediate charge Assange is facing has to do with the hacking of a Pentagon computer nearly a decade ago - totally different matter - exposing half a million U.S. documents. But since that time, Assange has also been busy, even from his refuge in the embassy, as we know. And there could be more charges. And there could be more revelations about Mr. Assange coming. All we know is, at this point, it capped a wild week at the White House.
SIMON: NPR's Ron Elving, thanks so much.
ELVING: Thank you, Scott.
SIMON: And we will note that Julian Assange has been acclaimed by some as a champion of free speech but also assailed as a stooge for Vladimir Putin and an indiscriminate and unscrupulous hacker. He now faces extradition to the United States, where he's been charged with conspiracy to commit computer intrusion. Copyright © 2019 NPR. All rights reserved.

Legal Battle Over Philadelphia's Proposed Safe Injection Site Heats Up : Shots - Health News,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/04/13/710253334/supporters-sue-to-open-safe-injection-site-in-philadelphia-citing-religious-free,"Enlarge this image Safehouse is considering locating in this block of Hilton Street in the Kensington section of Philadelphia.

Natalie Piserchio for NPR Natalie Piserchio for NPR Safehouse is considering locating in this block of Hilton Street in the Kensington section of Philadelphia. The proposed facility would allow drug users to inject under medical supervision. The neighborhood is known for its drug use.
Natalie Piserchio for NPR A nonprofit group in Philadelphia is fighting in court to be allowed to open the first facility in the country for people to use illegal opioids under medical supervision. The group, called Safehouse, has the backing of local government, yet faces a legal challenge from federal prosecutors.
The idea of supervised injection sites is to offer people a space where they can use drugs under the supervision of trained medical staff, who are prepared with the overdose-reversal drug naloxone. Such sites supply clean needles and other supplies, but users bring their own drugs.
After people are finished taking drugs, staff can talk to them about accessing treatment, legal counseling, housing and other social services.
""If you find a place that accepts the fact that you're going to be consuming drugs and still offers you services in a non-judgmental way, you're going to start to trust them,"" says Ronda Goldfein, the vice president and co-founder of Safehouse. ""And once there's a trust relationship, you're more inclined to accept the range of treatment they're offering, which includes recovery.""

Natalie Piserchio for NPR Natalie Piserchio for NPR Ronda Goldfein, Vice President of Safehouse and Executive Director of AIDS Law Project of Pennsylvania, in her Philadelphia home.
Natalie Piserchio for NPR Supervised injection sites operate in Canada, Europe and Australia, but one has never officially opened its doors in the United States. The group that runs Safehouse is hoping to launch its site sometime this year.
Opioid overdoses — especially from highly potent fentanyl — continue to rise around the country, and health officials in several other cities, including Seattle, New York and Denver and elected officials in Massachusetts, Vermont, and New Jersey have discussed similar injection site proposals.
But U.S. Attorney for the Philadelphia area William McSwain is trying to stop them
""These are folks who have good intentions,"" says McSwain. ""These are folks who are trying their best to combat the epidemic, but we think this step of opening an injection site is a step that crosses the line.""
McSwain and the Trump administration sued Safehouse in February. The prosecutors cited so-called ""crack house"" laws that make it a crime to own a property where drugs are being used.
Safehouse, in response, assembled a team of a dozen pro bono lawyers and earlier this month counter-sued the government in federal court in Philadelphia, setting up a dispute that legal experts say has the potential to test the limits of the law.
The Safehouse legal team maintains that drug laws from the 1980s were never meant to apply to a medical facility in the midst of a modern public health crisis.
""Safehouse is nothing like a 'crack house' or drug-fueled 'rave.' Nor is Safehouse established 'for the purpose' of unlawful drug use,"" Safehouse lawyer Ilana Eisenstein asserted in the filing, writing that the federal law cited by prosecutors, the Controlled Substances Act ""does not regulate medical treatment or the practice of medicine.""
The nonprofit's lawyers also argue in court documents that shutting down its proposed injection sites would violate the group's Judeo-Christian convictions about ""preserving life,"" thus violating the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, a 1993 federal law that protects people from being prevented from exercising their faith.
""[This] service is an exercise of the religious beliefs of its Board of Directors, who hold as core tenets preserving life, providing shelter to neighbors, and ministering to those most in need of physical and spiritual care,"" Eisenstein wrote to the court.
Shots - Health News What's The Evidence That Supervised Drug Injection Sites Save Lives? Shots - Health News U.S. Prosecutors Sue To Stop Nation's First Supervised Injection Site For Opioids Shots - Health News 'Church Of Safe Injection' Offers Needles, Naloxone To Prevent Opioid Overdoses Advocates compare a supervised injection site's life-saving potential to how syringe exchanges helped reduce deaths during the AIDs epidemic.
""If we feel like this is in our power to make this happen, or go down trying, we owe it to all those we've lost,"" Goldfein says.
Because of the legal uncertainty surrounding supervised injection, most efforts to open such sites around the country have stalled.
The legal confrontation with the federal government came as no surprise. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein told NPR last year that if any effort to open a supervised injection sites moves forward, the response would be swift and aggressive.
""If local governments get in the business of facilitating drug use ... they're actually inviting people to bring these illegal drugs into their places of business,"" Rosenstein said in August. ""If you start down that road, you're really going to undermine the deterrent message that I think is so important in order to prevent people from becoming addicted in the future.""
In Philadelphia, top public officials including the mayor and district attorney endorse the injection site proposal.
""I'm a public health official whose job it is to prevent needless deaths,"" says Philadelphia Health Commissioner Tom Farley. ""The evidence is clear that these facilities save lives, while serving as an entryway to drug treatment.""
Yet city leaders say no public money would be devoted to opening the facility. Instead, Safehouse is on its own to raise private money, something the nonprofit's members say they are continuing to do despite the legal tussle.
Both parties in the lawsuits agree on one thing: Much is riding on the outcome.
Whatever the court decides in this case could reverberate around the country, either paving the way for injection sites, or, perhaps permanently blocking them.
""You know, this is something that I think people will be looking at as, in a sense, a test case that will have implications in other districts,"" McSwain says.
The court fight is not the only hurdle Safehouse faces as it aims to open this year.

The neighborhood is home to open-air drug markets. Its residents have mixed feelings about the idea of a safe injection site.
Natalie Piserchio for NPR Political resistance has also been mounting in Philadelphia City Council — fanned by opposition from neighbors.
""It's ridiculous what they're even trying to do,"" resident Joe Capriotti told WHYY . Capriotti lives not far from a site being considered by Safehouse. ""Everything is wrong with it.""
In Philadelphia's Kensington neighborhood, one of the nation's largest open-air drug markets, an opioid user named Joe is also awaiting the decision.
Joe is only being identified by his first name since he uses illegal drugs. He's 35, from New Jersey and he used to sell mortgage loans for a living. He's been in treatment before, but recently relapsed. And he says, dangerous synthetic opioids are cheap and easy to acquire in Kensington.
""It's sad to see the people that are dying, man. I've had so many friends die and so many people that are on this ... they're not the same person. And I'm not the same person,"" he says.
Joe stands among discarded needles right across the street from a building Safehouse is considering moving into. Over the din of a noisy train track platform nearby, other users talk quietly with him before injecting drugs into their arms, just feet away from city police officers patrolling the neighborhood.
Joe says he has almost died from an opioid overdose. If the injection site opens, he says he would quickly become one of its clients.
Right now, he and his friends use drugs in abandoned buildings, alleyways and fast food bathrooms where fatal overdoses can happen quickly, without anyone there to help. It would be so much better, he says, to have medical staff standing by.
""I think it going to save lives and not take lives,"" he says."

Courtesy of Frontera Studio An art show opens in El Paso today. It's what they call a ""multi-sensory exhibit"" that includes works like a chapel, cut from cardboard, surrounded by trees and hedges spun from yarn, with Popsicle stick church pews and crosses. There are many images of bright birds, cooing in trees; and a looming volcano, smoking over a bright, cheery town.
The art was created by teenagers from Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador, and other countries when they were held in the Tornillo Children's Detention center in El Paso County between June 2018 and January 2019. More than 6,000 youngsters, called ""unaccompanied alien"" children, or UACs, in the argot of bureaucracy, passed through there.
The teenagers lived in tents for weeks, which often turned into months, with no idea when they might get out. A group of local teachers assigned to the shelter invited youngsters to create works of art: drawings, paintings, knitting, embroidery, and clay figures.
Many drew smiling parrots. Many sketched or painted scenes from a town church, with kindly countenances of the Madonna. Some cut and sewed traditional dresses. Many made clay figures of children, who played soccer, or rode and walked along with mules, alongside roads dotted with knit green hedges and trees.
One painting shows birds flocking over a forest that is thick with fuchsia trees, against a sky of orange and red.
National Coyotes' Boomtown: Picking Up The Migrant Trail On The Way To The U.S.-Mexico Border National Almost 15,000 Migrant Children Now Held At Nearly Full Shelters When Tornillo began to be dismantled in January, workers started to get rid of the artwork. But Father Rafael Garcia from El Paso's Sacred Heart Parish, who had said mass at the camp, didn't want the art of the children to be thrown away and forgotten.
""What came through in the art was the strong spirit of these young men and women,"" he told us, ""who, even under those conditions, were still inspired to do something beautiful.""
The art they made will be displayed at the Centennial Museum at the University of Texas at El Paso, and at the Museo Urbano in the Duranguito neighborhood until October.

It was written and directed by first-timer Nia DaCosta.
SCOTT SIMON, HOST:
""Little Woods"" is a new movie about a woman named Ollie, played by Tessa Thompson, who got busted smuggling drugs across the Canadian border and is now on parole, about to get off.
(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ""LITTLE WOODS"")
TESSA THOMPSON: (As Ollie) I've been applying for something normal, you know, so I can stop all the odd jobs and whatnot - all legal, of course.
LANCE REDDICK: (As character) And the illegal stuff - getting better at saying no?
THOMPSON: (As Ollie) Yes.
SIMON: ""Little Woods"" was directed and written by Nia DaCosta. It's her first film, and it captures the challenges facing women in rural America. NPR's Andrew Limbong reports.
ANDREW LIMBONG, BYLINE: One of the many little tragedies that drives the plot in ""Little Woods"" is that having a baby is expensive...
(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ""LITTLE WOODS"")
LILY JAMES: (As Deb) Being pregnant costs $8,000?
UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #2: (As character) I'm afraid so, honey.
LIMBONG: ...As Ollie's sister, Deb, played by Lily James, finds out.
(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ""LITTLE WOODS"")
UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #2: (As character) Have you considered going home and having the baby with family?
JAMES: (As Deb) I'm from here. I don't really have - what about other options?
LIMBONG: The movie is set in the fictional town of Little Woods, modeled after the very real oil boomtown Williston, N.D.
SARA SOLBERG: For everything, you're probably talking anywhere from $8,000 to $20,000 - maybe even more, depending on what's all going on.
LIMBONG: That's Dr. Sara Solberg, a practicing OB-GYN in Williston, N.D. She says the big issue of rural health care is distance. It's not rare for her to see patients coming in from 60 to 100 miles away. You also can't get an elective abortion in Williston, says Dr. Solberg. So patients looking for one...
SOLBERG: Typically, they look at going to Billings, Mont., which is about a little over 300 miles, or Fargo, N.D., to the east.
LIMBONG: Nearly 400 miles away.
Writer-director Nia DaCosta started writing ""Little Woods"" in 2014. Debate was raging over the Affordable Care Act - women's health care in particular.
NIA DACOSTA: And I was really struck by how there was no connection to actual people's lived experiences. And so I wanted to tell a story about that but filtered through the lens of women who lived in a rural part of America, and in particular, those who are struggling with poverty.
LIMBONG: Living in a rural area wasn't part of DaCosta's lived experience, but she wanted to make a movie about women she hadn't seen much of on-screen, which can be tricky - writing about a world that isn't wholly yours. Hit a few wrong notes and you risk coming off as insincere at best.
DACOSTA: Something that you learn in film school is write what you know. I used to take that really literally. Like, I'd be like, OK, I'm a black woman from New York. I like brunch. Like, this is my write-what-you-know sort of - you know?
But then I realized the better way of looking at that is write what you know emotionally. And emotionally, you connect with people who are completely unlike you and live in different places. And if you connect on that level with the story you're telling, with the people whose stories you're trying to tell, then you have a better shot at not condescending or lying, basically.
LIMBONG: So she whittled her movie down to two sisters, one of whom goes back to her criminal ways to help out the other.
MICHELLE SATTER: She always talked about it as a Western.
LIMBONG: That's Michelle Satter, a director at the Sundance Institute, which helped develop and train DaCosta as a writer and a director.
SATTER: You know, the idea of the so-called lone gunslinger who puts down the guns and then is called to action by the one person that they cannot refuse.
LIMBONG: There's gold in the hills of ""Little Woods."" It's not a navel-gazey rumination on the personal costs of societal forces. DaCosta's more interested in the dramatic techniques from films she grew up watching.
DACOSTA: And I have to bring up Scorsese because I'm pretty sure when I found out he went to Tisch, I was, like, got to go there, like, as a 15-year-old. I think, like, '70s filmmaking in general was really huge for me because I was like, these men are insane. They're making these crazy movies, and anything is possible.
LIMBONG: It's telling what's up next for DaCosta. She's directing the new ""Candyman"" movie, written by Jordan Peele, as well as writing and directing a new version of ""Sleeping With The Enemy."" Saying something new with these forgotten '90s properties might seem like a wild idea unless you truly believe that anything is possible. Andrew Limbong, NPR News.

Remembering World War II Pilot Dick Cole,www.npr.org,,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/13/712996995/remembering-world-war-ii-pilot-dick-cole,"NPR's Scott Simon talks to author Laura Hillenbrand about the life of World War II pilot Dick Cole, the last surviving member of the Doolittle Raid. He died this week at age 103.
SCOTT SIMON, HOST:
A remembrance now of the last of Doolittle's Raiders (ph). Lieutenant Colonel Dick Cole died this week. He was 103 years old. He was Jimmy Doolittle's co-pilot April of 1942 at the controls of one of the 16 B-25 bombers that took off from the aircraft carrier Hornet on what many regarded as a suicide mission - the first counterattack against the Japanese mainland after Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor.
Laura Hillenbrand, the author of ""Seabiscuit"" and ""Unbroken,"" knew Dick Cole. She wanted to write a book about him. Welcome back to our program, Laura.
LAURA HILLENBRAND: Thank you so much for having me.
SIMON: I guess we need to remind ourselves in this day and age, why was this mission particularly dangerous?
HILLENBRAND: The United States was really knocked back by Pearl Harbor. And after that, the Japanese were just on a winning streak. And the United States could do nothing about it because they had no land base from which to launch bombers and go after Japan.
And they had what I think is kind of an insane idea, which is they were going to take 16 B-25s, which are medium-sized bombers. They were going to hoist them onto the carrier Hornet, sail it out off the Japanese coast and launch them. And these planes normally took several thousand feet of runway to take off. There's only about 500 feet on the Hornet. And they modified the planes and launched these planes.
SIMON: And they had to launch - what? - 200 miles prematurely?
HILLENBRAND: They did. They had a plan that was going to take the planes over Japan, bomb Japan and then head on to friendly bases in China. And Japanese boats spotted their task force way early. They had to launch right at that moment. And they did. And the men knew they did not have enough fuel to make it. They knew they were very likely to die, very likely to ditch. And everyone had the opportunity to back out. Not a single man did. They all went.
SIMON: So what did happen to Lieutenant Colonel Dick Cole and his aircraft?
HILLENBRAND: They flew over Japan, and they looked down. Cole remembered seeing people waving up and smiling at them as they flew over. They thought they were friendly planes. The Japanese thought there was no way enemy planes could reach them, especially big bombers like that. They had some flak, but they were not hit badly.
They headed out over the China Sea, and they started to run out of fuel. And a tail wind caught them and carried them over the Chinese coast. And then their fuel ran out in the darkness in a wild thunderstorm over the mountains of China. And Cole had to jump out of the plane. He had never even practiced parachuting. He'd had no training at all. And he just dove out of the plane headfirst.
He walked for a day, and he found a building with a nationalist Chinese flag hanging over it. And a soldier was there - a Chinese soldier - and invited him in. And the man took him to a dark room, and there was Jimmy Doolittle.
SIMON: Oh, my gosh.
HILLENBRAND: Yeah - amazing moment. And from then, it was a race to get out of where they were because the Japanese were hunting them.
SIMON: Now, we must note the actual damage inflicted on Japan was limited. Why was the mission considered such a success?
HILLENBRAND: The Japanese were so confident that they were spreading out over the globe and not concentrating their forces. And when this raid happened, that terrified them. And they contracted their forces. And they decided to take aim for Midway Atoll, which, if they could claim it, would give them a land base, making America more vulnerable and making themselves safer.
And essentially, the raid lured them into that. We had the Battle of Midway. The United States won it triumphantly. And it turned the course of the war. So these guys - these 80 men on 16 planes - turned the course of history with that little raid.
SIMON: Did Dick Cole have a happy life after the war?
HILLENBRAND: He did. He was a - kind of an institution at the Doolittle Raider reunions that were held every year. And they had a tradition there. The city of Tucson had made up 80 silver goblets inscribed with the names of the 80 men from the raid. And the names were written on one side right-side up and another side upside down.
And each year, the men would privately gather and drink brandy in a toast to whoever had passed away the previous year. And then that man's goblet would be turned upside down. And there was one goblet that was still upright. And it actually still is now. But there's going to be a ceremony to turn over the very last one because they're all gone now.
SIMON: Laura Hillenbrand talking about Lieutenant Colonel Dick Cole. Thanks so much, Laura.
HILLENBRAND: Thank you so much.

Georgetown Students Vote To Fund Reparations For School's Slavery Connections,www.npr.org,,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/13/712996988/georgetown-students-vote-to-fund-reparations-for-schools-slavery-connections,"Georgetown University students voted to set up a fund to pay reparations to the descendants of slaves sold by the school. NPR's Scott Simon talks with Hannah Michael, who helped organize the effort.
SCOTT SIMON, HOST:
In 1838, Georgetown University sold 272 enslaved people to pay off a debt. Over the last several years, there has been a reckoning on campus as the school wrestles with its ties to slavery. It renamed several buildings that had honored people involved in the slave trade. Some descendants of that original group of enslaved people are now enrolled at the university.
This week, Georgetown undergraduate students voted to set up a fund that would pay reparations to descendants of slaves the school owned. Hannah Michael helped write that resolution. She is a sophomore, who joins us now from campus. Ms. Michael, thanks so much for being with us.
HANNAH MICHAEL: Thank you for having me.
SIMON: And how would the money in this fund be used?
MICHAEL: So the referendum proposes a $27.20 fee added to the cost of attendance semesterly at Georgetown University. It's designated by five students and five descendants, who would be democratically elected. And they would utilize the funds to work on projects or initiatives meant to empower and support descendant communities - things like eyeglass exams, things like Internet access, paving roads.
So we included things like that as recommendations so that they're nonbinding in order to allow the descendants and students on the board to really sit down and to analyze the needs of descendant communities and to collaboratively come up with the best way to address those needs.
SIMON: You're a student at Georgetown in 2019. Why was this important to you?
MICHAEL: It's important to me because this university's modern existence is possible because of that 1838 sale. It's important to me because as an American citizen, I know that this country was founded upon the labor of enslaved African-American people. So to me, this is really my way of using the resources that I have to empower others - resources that I have because of the ancestors of descendants.
SIMON: Let me ask you a question I gather some of your fellow students have asked. Why should today's students, including African-American students, whose families already have to pay tens of thousands of dollars in tuition, have to pay to support a fund to try to compensate for sins that were committed 180 years ago?
MICHAEL: I think that what's been helpful is recognizing that while the university committed moral sins and should go through the process of morally rectifying that history, that slaveholding legacy, Georgetown students, as beneficiaries and members of the Georgetown University community, also have a similar obligation.
SIMON: This week's vote, as I don't have to tell you, was nonbinding. The board of trustees would have to implement it. I wonder if you've spoken with anyone on that board, have any idea how they're inclined.
MICHAEL: I think that there's a lot of uncertainty about what will happen next. I think that this is a really great opportunity for the board of trustees to move from dialogue to action because all they have to do is empower and validate the work that has already been done by students by allowing for this resource, this board, to exist.
SIMON: About a third of the students voted the other way. What would you say to them?
MICHAEL: I would encourage them to develop a personal connection with Georgetown University's slaveholding legacy. This isn't about punishment. This is not a punitive measure. This is about using resources, giving back resources. I think that once students really make that connection, it's actually really beautiful to see how empathetic and to see how compassionate a lot of Georgetown students are on this issue.
SIMON: Hannah Michael, who is a sophomore and activist at Georgetown University, thanks so much for being with us.
MICHAEL: Thank you so much.

Army Reservist On Transgender Military Ban,www.npr.org,,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/13/712996981/army-reservist-on-transgender-military-ban,"Army Reservist On Transgender Military Ban Army Reservist On Transgender Military Ban Embed Embed
NPR's Scott Simon talks to Elliot Sommer, a graduate student in the Army Reserves, about the Trump administration's policy barring transgender personnel from serving in the military.
SCOTT SIMON, HOST:
The Trump administration's policy barring transgender people from serving openly in the military went into effect yesterday. The policy has forced transgender soldiers and other personnel to either try to conceal their identity and keep quiet or file paperwork to get a diagnosis of gender dysphoria before Friday. If a service member did not get that diagnosis and is openly transgender, they will be discharged. Elliot Sommer is a graduate student in the U.S. Army Reserves and has been waiting for that diagnosis for months, yesterday finally discovered what's next for him. And he joins us now.
Mr. Sommer, thanks for being with us.
ELLIOT SOMMER: Well, thank you for having me.
SIMON: And will you still be able to serve?
SOMMER: Yes, the Army Reserve surgeon had signed my paperwork, and I will be able to continue serving.
SIMON: What's it been like for you waiting?
SOMMER: Incredibly stressful. We are coming down to a pretty tight timeline to try to get everything done. But it's been tough, especially with everything being out of my hands.
SIMON: When you say getting everything done, help us understand what that entails.
SOMMER: So as a reservist, I had to submit a packet of paperwork that included a plan for my transition and a diagnosis from a civilian medical provider of gender dysphoria through my chain of command. And it had to travel up through different levels of command to the reserve surgeon. And she had to approve that diagnosis that was made by a civilian provider.
SIMON: Now, the administration has said that this policy does not ban transgender people from serving because they can still serve, just in the sex in which they were born. I wonder how you answer that.
SOMMER: Transition is a medically necessary treatment for gender dysphoria. And not every transgender person experiences dysphoria. But barring those from medically necessary treatment based on a medical condition - that's where the ban is.
SIMON: You're transitioning from woman to man. And I understand treatment doesn't begin until December. Is that correct?
SOMMER: So my transition has already begun. Hormone replacement therapy has begun by civilian provider. And the military is aware. However, the treatment plan that I had submitted includes other things, such as potential surgeries - and this is for every service member. They have to submit a treatment plan. Once that treatment plan is completed, there's a timeline in that treatment plan of when your gender marker will change in the eyes of the Department of Defense. So the plan that I had submitted would result in a gender marker change of female to male in December of this year.
SIMON: Forgive me for not knowing, but how will you mark it? How will you present yourself differently?
SOMMER: So currently, to the military, I am female, which means that I have to follow all regulations - physical presentation and housing and bathroom and every female regulation that is on the books. And then in December, once that changes from female to male, I will then be required to fall under all of the appearance, physical fitness, bathroom, housing, all of the male regulations for that.
SIMON: Are these going to be tough months ahead for you, feeling and identifying as one way but having to live as a woman?
SOMMER: I think that I have it better than some others that have to live as someone that they're not full time. Being a reservist on the civilian side, I live as male full time. And everybody at my unit that I have come out to has been absolutely wonderful. So I'm hoping that in these next few months, as things progress and paperwork gets approved further and we get closer to that December change, I'm hoping that it becomes easier and easier.
SIMON: Why did you enlist, Mr. Sommer?
SOMMER: My grandfather was an infantryman in World War II. And growing up hearing his stories made me want to be a part of something bigger than myself. My other grandfather was a Marine during Korea. And I want to be involved in researching PTSD to help people that have been affected by PTSD from a variety of traumatic incidences, especially combat.
SIMON: So even after all these trials, you want to serve your country in the military.
SOMMER: Absolutely.
SIMON: Elliot Sommer, a graduate student in the U.S. Army Reserves, thank you so much.

Assange's Arrest And Free Speech,www.npr.org,,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/13/712996929/assanges-arrest-and-free-speech,"Assange's Arrest And Free Speech Assange's Arrest And Free Speech Embed Embed
NPR's Scott Simon talks with the ACLU's Ben Wizner about what the arrest of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange could mean for press freedoms.
SCOTT SIMON, HOST:
Ben Wizner joins us now. He's director of the Speech, Privacy and Technology Project of the American Civil Liberties Union. He's also been a legal adviser to Edward Snowden. Thanks so much for being with us.
BEN WIZNER: It's a pleasure, Scott.
SIMON: The U.S. charges against Julian Assange - I guess I should say so far - seem to pointedly be for hacking, not publishing any information. Do you believe it represents any kind of threat to a free press?
WIZNER: Well, you're right. This was not the indictment that free-speech activists were the most worried about. We were worried this would be the first time in the history of the country that the Justice Department brought charges against a publisher for the publication of truthful information. This indictment doesn't represent that. Nevertheless, there is some cause for concern. The indictment itself describes a criminal conspiracy that includes the kinds of activities that investigative journalists do routinely - encouraging a source to provide more information, helping a source conceal her identity, using secure means of communication. The government sees all of those as elements of a criminal conspiracy. And that doesn't bode well, I think, for press freedom.
SIMON: In the time that Julian Assange has been in the embassy, haven't people grown a lot more concerned about the invasion of privacy that's involved in hacking and their right to privacy?
WIZNER: Well, let's be clear - he's actually not charged with having hacked anything...
SIMON: But trying to, right?
WIZNER: Well, I mean, the indictment makes clear that Chelsea Manning had already provided the hundreds of thousands of documents to WikiLeaks before they even had this agreement. But, again, I think that no one will dispute that information from this archive that was published was in the public interest, that some of it revealed evidence of war crimes, others - very important information that was published by The New York Times, by The Guardian, by Der Spiegel. Certainly, most journalists follow a publication model that's not the same as WikiLeaks and are more careful about redacting information that's not in the public interest and only publishing that which is. I think the difficulty for the government here is, how do you describe a set of conduct that WikiLeaks engages in that's criminal without also threatening the ordinary investigative journalism of more mainstream publications?
SIMON: How do you believe that the ordinary investigative journalism might be threatened?
WIZNER: There's a way in which investigative journalism looks like a criminal conspiracy. If an investigative journalist is talking to a national security source and says, tell me about X, Y or Z, the answer to that question is going to be a felony under U.S. law. But that happens on a very, very routine basis. That's what these reporters do. This indictment, which essentially describes those kinds of activities as being elements of a criminal conspiracy, is something we should worry about.
SIMON: Has Julian Assange really been a publisher? Or if I might put it this way, has he been doing Russia's laundry?
WIZNER: The law doesn't necessarily look at what somebody's intent is in publishing. Remember, if you're talking about Russia's laundry from the 2016 election, The New York Times did it, as well. So did most news entities in the United States. They all published from those hacks because they considered it to be in the public interest. And, again, this is why I think the Obama administration ultimately concluded not to bring these charges, even though all of these facts were known. They just didn't think that they could thread the needle and find a way to criminalize Assange, despite their profound dislike of him and his activities, without putting journalism itself in the crosshairs.
SIMON: And may I ask, is Julian Assange an appealing advertisement for free speech?
WIZNER: No one would choose Julian Assange to be the poster child for freedom of the press. What worries me is that these kinds of bad facts make bad law. If Assange is prosecuted here, he'll have no champions on the left or the right. Everyone here will, in some sense, applaud what happens to him personally. But those are the cases that can create precedents that will be used against people who are much more personally appealing.
SIMON: Ben Wizner directs the ACLU Speech, Privacy and Technology Project. Thanks so much for being with us.

Courtesy of Frontera Studio An art show opens in El Paso today. It's what they call a ""multi-sensory exhibit"" that includes works like a chapel, cut from cardboard, surrounded by trees and hedges spun from yarn, with Popsicle stick church pews and crosses. There are many images of bright birds, cooing in trees; and a looming volcano, smoking over a bright, cheery town.
The art was created by teenagers from Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador, and other countries when they were held in the Tornillo Children's Detention center in El Paso County between June 2018 and January 2019. More than 6,000 youngsters, called ""unaccompanied alien"" children, or UACs, in the argot of bureaucracy, passed through there.
The teenagers lived in tents for weeks, which often turned into months, with no idea when they might get out. A group of local teachers assigned to the shelter invited youngsters to create works of art: drawings, paintings, knitting, embroidery, and clay figures.
Many drew smiling parrots. Many sketched or painted scenes from a town church, with kindly countenances of the Madonna. Some cut and sewed traditional dresses. Many made clay figures of children, who played soccer, or rode and walked along with mules, alongside roads dotted with knit green hedges and trees.
One painting shows birds flocking over a forest that is thick with fuchsia trees, against a sky of orange and red.

But Father Rafael Garcia from El Paso's Sacred Heart Parish, who had said mass at the camp, didn't want the art of the children to be thrown away and forgotten.
""What came through in the art was the strong spirit of these young men and women,"" he told us, ""who, even under those conditions, were still inspired to do something beautiful.""
The art they made will be displayed at the Centennial Museum at the University of Texas at El Paso, and at the Museo Urbano in the Duranguito neighborhood until October.

How Shrinking Newsrooms Impact Local Politics,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/13/712997066/how-shrinking-newsrooms-impact-local-politics?station=KXJZ_FM,"A study in Urban Affairs Review found shrinking newsrooms can potentially impact the number of candidates who run for mayor. NPR's Scott Simon talks to professor Meghan Rubado, co-author of the study.
SCOTT SIMON, HOST:
When local newspapers shrink, local communities pay the price. Research has shown that smaller newsrooms result in the scrutiny of government, lower voter turnout - and now, according to a new study, potentially fewer people who run for mayor. What are the implications of that? Meghan Rubado, a professor at Cleveland State University and a former journalist, co-authored the new study in Urban Affairs Review. She joins us from the studios of WCPN in Cleveland. Professor, thanks so much for being with us.
MEGHAN RUBADO: Thanks for having me.
SIMON: I gather you saw this firsthand in Syracuse when you were a city hall reporter.
RUBADO: That's right. So I was a reporter at the Syracuse Post-Standard from about 2004 to 2010, and that was really during the worst, the most precipitous decline in newsroom staffing levels. So I witnessed a lot of that decline.
SIMON: And how did that translate to fewer people running for mayor, though?
RUBADO: Our theory is that when people know less about what their public officials are up to, quality challengers are less likely to emerge. So people have to know that a mayor or a councilor or a school board member is not doing a good job in order to sort of get up the nerve or the interest to challenge them in the next election.
SIMON: This study looked at, I gather, 11 newspapers in California, right?
RUBADO: That's right.
SIMON: And what did you find?
RUBADO: So we connected these newspapers to all the municipalities that they serve and examined their mayoral elections over a period of 20 years. And so what we see is that as that decline happened, newspapers that more dramatically cut their staff suffered sort of objectively negative political outcomes - fewer candidates running for mayor, largery (ph) victory margins for the winners and more incumbent-only races. Additionally, we saw some suggestive evidence that voter turnout declined under these conditions of more loss of news staff.
SIMON: And how do you react to the argument, well, more candidates don't necessarily mean better candidates?
RUBADO: Well, of course they don't always mean better candidates. But I think when voters don't have a choice - right? - and that's sort of what we're seeing. We're seeing that this decline tends to result in the difference between having an option and not having an option. I think it challenges the incumbent mayor, even if the candidate who's running against them is unlikely to win. If they feel any kind of threat to their job, they're more likely to feel that electoral connection to the voters and serve them better, represent them better.
SIMON: We do note there was a mayoral election there in Cleveland in 2017. The town has just one newspaper, which is cutting staff.
RUBADO: Yes, indeed.
SIMON: Mayor Frank Jackson was re-elected to a fourth term, but there were 11 candidates on the ballot. So how does that conform with your findings?
RUBADO: Right. So we looked at not just central cities, but the cities that surround the central city, as well. So while we might see these large numbers of candidates continuing to run in the central cities, still, we would expect that number to be higher and to be higher with quality challengers if the newspaper is doing a really good job of covering local politics. In the outlying cities in the first-ring suburbs and the outer suburbs, we expect this is more likely to be the difference between having a challenger and not having a challenger - having two people running versus one or maybe three versus one or two.
SIMON: And this has to do with the quality of democracy, doesn't it?
RUBADO: It definitely does. So the things that we observe - this reduced political competition, reduced voter engagement - when these conditions exist, it means that our elected officials are less tied to the voters. They're held less accountable. And if that's the case, there's lots of concern about what happens under those conditions - more corruption, less representation of voters, less effective governance.
SIMON: Meghan Rubado, professor at Cleveland State University. Thanks so much for being with us.
RUBADO: Thank you.

More Possible Graves Found At Florida School,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/13/712997030/more-possible-graves-found-at-florida-school?station=KXJZ_FM,"Workers doing cleanup at a now-closed reform school in Florida have found 27 sites that may be unmarked graves. Researchers previously found more than 50 graves of boys who died at the school.
SCOTT SIMON, HOST:
Workers have made a grisly discovery at a defunct reform school in Florida - 27 sites that may hold graves. The find isn't totally unexpected. Several years ago, researchers unearthed more than 50 unmarked graves that contained the remains of boys who died at the notorious Dozier School. NPR's Greg Allen has more.
GREG ALLEN, BYLINE: Over the decades, until it closed in 2011, a series of investigations at the Dozier School found that boys - some as young as 6 and 7 - were subjected to harsh treatment that sometimes included severe beatings.
JERRY COOPER: These people were not right in the mind. I'm sorry.
ALLEN: Jerry Cooper is one of a group of men who, as boys, were held at the Dozier School. They've been outspoken about the abuse they received in a small white building on the school campus. The White House Boys, as they became known, believed that some children died from the abuse and were buried in unmarked graves at the school. Their accounts led a team of researchers from the University of South Florida to begin a search that eventually recovered the remains of 51 individuals.
That closed the book on the search for graves at the Dozier School until recently, when a company began working near the spot where the graves were found, an area known as Boot Hill. Using ground-penetrating radar, workers found 27 anomalies - sites, they concluded, that could be graves. Jerry Cooper, one of the White House Boys, says it confirms what his members have long been saying.
COOPER: We have, on a list, a total of 183 boys that cannot be accounted for, sir. I'm not surprised at all.
ALLEN: The survey of the area was conducted last year, and the report of the additional possible gravesites was filed in January. The information became public this week when Florida Governor Ron DeSantis sent a letter to officials in Jackson County, which now owns the site. DeSantis is asking the county to work with state agencies to handle the site, quote, ""with the utmost sensitivity and care."" Cooper has looked at the consultant's report on the anomalies. He says to him, they look like graves.
COOPER: Some of them are very shallow, which tells me this is a repeat of Boot Hill because we had a lot of shallow graves at Boot Hill - what we call hasty burials.
ALLEN: The work at the old Dozier School is going on as part of Jackson County's plan to redevelop the site. Deciding what to do about these and any additional graves found on the site may slow that down. County officials say they'll work with the governor to address all concerns. Cooper believes the state, as a former owner of the school, should take charge of determining how many boys died there and where they're buried. Greg Allen, NPR News.

Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf On Trump And 'Sanctuary Cities',www.npr.org,npr.org,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/13/712997016/oakland-mayor-libby-schaaf-on-trump-and-sanctuary-cities?station=KXJZ_FM,"President Trump said he is considering sending detained immigrants in the country illegally to ""sanctuary cities."" Scott Simon gets reaction from Mayor Libby Schaaf of Oakland, a ""sanctuary city.""
SCOTT SIMON, HOST:
Could detained migrants be moved into places that call themselves sanctuary cities? President Trump says he's strongly considering the idea, placing apprehended migrants in cities that have declared themselves sanctuaries. That is cities that limit their cooperation with federal immigration officials. President Trump said in a tweet, the radical left always seems to have an open borders, open arms policy, so this should make them very happy. Libby Schaaf is the mayor of Oakland, Calif., a sanctuary city. Mayor Schaaf, thanks so much for being with us.
LIBBY SCHAAF: Oh, thanks for having me.
SIMON: Do you welcome this chance for Oakland to welcome migrants?
SCHAAF: Listen. Oakland is a city that prides itself on diversity and inclusion. We are proud of the immigrant community that we have right now. And it's our job to not build walls but build bridges and welcome all people and celebrate the richness that diverse cultures bring to our city. We also know that immigrants actually make a safer city, despite the lies and the divisive rhetoric that this president continues to drive to separate the American people. We know that data proves that undocumented or documented immigrants commit far fewer crimes. So not only is our community richer and more loving. But it also is safer because we are a sanctuary city and a diverse city.
SIMON: But let me hone this down to the point that's at issue now. If sometime, let's say, in the middle of next week, a number of buses arrive in Oakland with 5,000 migrants, do you say, welcome to Oakland?
SCHAAF: I always say, welcome to Oakland. But this is much less about immigration or sanctuary. This is about an outrageous abuse of power. The idea that you could use human beings, families as instruments of political payback to use public resources to exact retribution on your political enemies. This is not America. It is not democratic. And this is what should outrage all Americans, regardless of their stance on immigration or sanctuary cities.
SIMON: I've gotten two very complete answers from you to essentially the question, would you welcome more migrants? I haven't heard a yes.
SCHAAF: I said yes. Oakland welcomes all people.
SIMON: So specifically in this case, if more migrants show up, that's fine with you?
SCHAAF: My job as a mayor is to welcome people. I don't build walls. It's our job to welcome everyone into our city, ensure their safety, ensure that their families can thrive. And that is my job no matter where those people came from or how they got there.
SIMON: Do you think the president is testing the sincerity of liberal Democrats?
SCHAAF: I think the president is trying to whip up his base. He's trying to continue to drive lies, racist lies about immigrants. And he's trying to distract from the fact that his cutting of aid to countries that now have conditions that force families to flee and seek political asylum in our country - the fact that he's not addressing some of the pressing problems that are within America and tries to distract the public with this hate-mongering - that is the biggest problem.
SIMON: Would, let's say, a thousand more immigrants greatly tax the resources of Oakland?
SCHAAF: Oakland is growing very quickly. And we welcome families. We welcome people that seek to make better lives for their families, that are willing to work hard and become wonderful members of our community.
SIMON: Mayor Libby Schaaf of Oakland, thanks so much for being with us.
SCHAAF: Thank you.

SOMMER: I think that I have it better than some others that have to live as someone that they're not full time. Being a reservist on the civilian side, I live as male full time. And everybody at my unit that I have come out to has been absolutely wonderful. So I'm hoping that in these next few months, as things progress and paperwork gets approved further and we get closer to that December change, I'm hoping that it becomes easier and easier.
SIMON: Why did you enlist, Mr. Sommer?
SOMMER: My grandfather was an infantryman in World War II. And growing up hearing his stories made me want to be a part of something bigger than myself. My other grandfather was a Marine during Korea. And I want to be involved in researching PTSD to help people that have been affected by PTSD from a variety of traumatic incidences, especially combat.
SIMON: So even after all these trials, you want to serve your country in the military.
SOMMER: Absolutely.
SIMON: Elliot Sommer, a graduate student in the U.S. Army Reserves, thank you so much.
SOMMER: Thank you.

"Under Employers' Gaze, Gen Z Is Biting Its Tongue On Social Media",www.npr.org,npr.org,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/13/702555175/under-employers-gaze-gen-z-is-biting-its-tongue-on-social-media?station=KXJZ_FM,"Enlarge this image Only about 1 in 10 teenagers say they share personal, religious or political beliefs on social media, according to a recent survey from Pew Research Center.

toggle caption Karly Domb Sadof/AP Only about 1 in 10 teenagers say they share personal, religious or political beliefs on social media, according to a recent survey from Pew Research Center.
Karly Domb Sadof/AP Malak Silmi was taking her first real journalism class last January when her professor said something that changed her life: Watch what you post on social media because it might just come back to bite you.
Silmi's Twitter account at the time was one she'd had since she was 14. It was a public profile with her content ranging from memes and status updates to opinions on foreign policy. But she decided something had to change if she wanted to be taken seriously as a journalist. So, she deactivated it.
""I understand the need to censor oneself, but sometimes I don't think it's fair,"" said the 19-year-old. ""Even liking on Twitter is hard because people can see what you like — it pops up on their timeline even if they're not looking through your account.""
Silmi and many of her peers say they worry about being unable to express any opinions on social media out of fear of self-sabotaging a potential career opportunity. The oldest members of Generation Z are around 22 years old — now entering the workforce and adjusting their social media accordingly. They are holding back from posting political opinions and personal information in favor of posting about professional accomplishments.
In fact, only about 1 in 10 teenagers say they share personal, religious or political beliefs on social media, according to a recent survey from Pew Research Center.
Employers are watching — and asking job seekers to walk a careful line between sharing the wrong kind of information and staying away from social media altogether. These days, 70 percent of employers and recruiters say they check social media during the hiring process, according to a survey conducted by CareerBuilder, a company that connects employers and candidates. More than half of employers said they have not hired a candidate because of content they found on social media, but a similar number said if they can't find an applicant online, they are less likely to call that person in for an interview.
Technology Facebook Promises To Stop Asking You To Wish Happy Birthday To Your Friend Who Died Civility Wars Keeping It Civil: How To Talk Politics Without Letting Things Turn Ugly ""Hiring is always kind of a judgment call,"" says Michelle Armer, the chief people officer at CareerBuilder. ""Employers are eager to find more information that will support the decision that they're making.""
Silmi realized the only way to beat those employers was not to leave social media completely, but to join their game.
From the ashes of her old account that detailed her youth, a new one arose: This account was public, too, but it depicted a professional persona that was lacking in the other account. She uses this new account to share credible news articles and the latest updates on her journalism career — with a few sports tweets scattered in between.

— Malak Silmi (@MalakSilmi) April 6, 2019 Silmi's generation grew up with social media. Generation Z, nicknamed ""iGen,"" is the post-millennial generation responsible for 'killing' Facebook and for the rise of TikTok .
Twitter went live in 2006, and Snapchat in 2011, when the older members of Gen Z were only 14. A lifetime of exposure, some experts say, actually makes them the most prepared generation for this kind of social media surveillance.
""In a sense, [Gen Zers] are actually in better positions than millennials who embrace a much more rigid social network, like Facebook,"" said Taylor Lorenz, an Internet culture reporter at The Atlantic . ""Because [Gen Z] has grown up with a lot of these platforms, they are cognizant of their image from the time that they're getting on social media.""
In fact, Lorenz notes, some children start thinking of their online presence in the third grade . Because of this awareness, they're very careful of curating their online branding. According to Colby Zintl, the vice president of external affairs for Common Sense Media, this opens up a need to teach youth about social media.
""We teach people to drive, how to have safe sex, and how to eat well: the Internet is just another one of those things that need to come with some instructions,"" said Zintl. Curricula like Common Sense Education's digital citizenship program are working to educate the younger generation on how to use social media, something the older generations were never taught.
Because of this extra education and hands-on learning, teenagers are often more savvy of these social platforms than the employers that are searching through them — it's just a matter of making social media work for them, rather than against them.
Some users are regularly cleaning up — ""re-curating"" — their online profiles. That can mean changing the people they follow and the things they post, or deleting old posts that no longer reflect a personal brand. Cleanup apps, like TweetDelete , exist to help during this process.
""There's an expectation right now that you have control over your own feed, because you do,"" said Lorenz. ""So you need to be constantly re-curating them.""
Gen Zers also use social media in more ephemeral ways than older generations — Snapchat stories that disappear after 24 hours, or Instagram posts that they archive a couple of months later.
Where Facebook is usually tied directly to a user's real name and identity, the personas on the platforms Gen Zers use, like Twitter and Instagram, can be altered and controlled. Gen Zers already use a multitude of strategies to make sure their online presence is visible only to who they want: They set their account to private, change their profile name or handle, even make completely separate"

toggle caption Tom Brenner/Getty Images Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., attends a Youth Climate Strike on March 15 in Washington. On Thursday, the New York Post drew criticism after featuring a partial quote by Omar with an image from the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.
Tom Brenner/Getty Images The New York Post is facing a barrage of criticism after its cover on Thursday featured an image of the World Trade Center, burning in the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, below a terse quote by one of the first Muslim women serving in Congress.
""Rep. Ilhan Omar: 9/11 was 'Some people did something,' "" the cover read . A caption underneath added, ""Here's your something ... 2,977 people dead by terrorism.""
The quote came from a speech Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., gave last month. She was speaking at a banquet hosted by the Council on American-Islamic Relations, discussing how terrorism has led to a rise in Islamophobia.
National Minnesota Congresswoman Ignites Debate On Israel And Anti-Semitism ""Far too long we have lived with the discomfort of being a second-class citizen and frankly, I'm tired of it, and every single Muslim in this country should be tired of it,"" she told the crowd. ""CAIR was founded after 9/11 because they recognized that some people did something and that all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties."" (The Sept. 11 attacks occurred in 2001. CAIR was was founded in 1994.)
Days after the banquet, critics zeroed in on her description of the terrorist attacks, inciting outrage that bore resemblance to the condemnation she received after making remarks about Israel .
On Fox & Friends , co-host Brian Kilmeade told viewers, ""You have to wonder if [Omar] is an American first.""
""This woman is a disgrace,"" Donald Trump Jr. tweeted .
This is ugly pic.twitter.com/R2XVyS4dq8
— Harry Siegel (@harrysiegel) April 11, 2019 Rep. Dan Crenshaw , R-Texas, a former Navy SEAL who lost an eye in a bombing in Afghanistan, said it was ""unbelievable."" ""You described an act of terrorism on American soil that killed thousands of innocent lives as 'some people did something.' It's still unbelievable,"" he later wrote on Twitter .
Rep. Ben Ray Luján, D-N.M., and assistant speaker in the House, told MSNBC , ""Those statements were not only hurtful to me, but extremely hurtful to everyone that was personally impacted by those terrorist attacks.""
But the Post 's incendiary cover, released at a time when owner Rupert Murdoch and Fox have come under intense scrutiny , has made it the target of a different strain of anger.
""Their intention was to be inflammatory, to generate sales at the expense of dividing our country,"" Hassan Shibly, head of CAIR's Florida chapter, tells NPR.
""Far too many people have tried to blame, even retaliate, against Muslim communities when we are victims of that attack just like all Americans,"" Shibly says.
Omar continues to receive death threats, he says. ""Obviously the first hijab-wearing, American Muslim woman [in Congress] is going to be the first target,"" he says. ""People's deep-seated hatred for the Muslim community is now being projected onto her.""
Joseph Azam, one of Murdoch's former top executives, described the newspaper cover as ""the virulent anti-Muslim bigotry being put out by various parts of the Murdoch empire."" Azam recently told NPR he left his post because he was sickened by the coverage of Muslims, race and immigration in Murdoch's outlets. ""They are going to get ppl killed - is that the goal?"" Azam tweeted Thursday.
House colleagues came to Omar's aid. Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., tweeted, ""The NY Post knows exactly what it's doing - taking quotes out of context and evoking painful imagery to spread hate and endangering the life of Rep. Omar. Shame on them, and shame on Rupert Murdoch.""
Media Former Murdoch Executive Says He Quit Over Fox's Anti-Muslim Rhetoric Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez,‏ D-N.Y., called the cover ""horrifying"" and ""hateful,"" before adding that Omar co-sponsored the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund. She told reporters that the wrath against Omar was ""not a normal level of political debate or rhetoric.""
The New York Post did not immediately respond to NPR's requests for comment.
On Friday, Omar herself quoted words uttered in the wake of Sept. 11 by former President George W. Bush, adding, ""Was Bush downplaying the terrorist attack?""
The newspaper cover wasn't the first time Omar was linked to the Sept. 11 attacks. A poster at a winter event sponsored by the Republican Party of West Virginia showed a photo of the congresswoman, wearing a hijab, beneath a photo of the twin towers engulfed by flames.
National Sign Falsely Linking Muslim Congresswoman To Sept. 11 Sparks Outrage In West Virginia A group called ACT for America, which had set up a table near that poster, describes itself as a national security organization and is labeled as an anti-Muslim hate group, promoted the Post cover on Twitter. It called Omar's rhetoric ""dangerous.""
According to a 2018 Pew Research Center estimate , Muslims made up about 3.45 million people in the United States in 2017, slightly more than 1 percent of the total population."
"Former 'Ebony' Publisher Declares Bankruptcy, And An Era Ends : Code Switch : NPR",www.npr.org,Karen Grigsbates,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2019/04/13/712437648/former-ebony-publisher-declares-bankruptcy-and-an-era-ends,"Enlarge this image Founder of Ebony magazine and Johnson Publishing Company John H. Johnson. Almost 15 years after the company was handed down to his daughter, JPC is filing for bankruptcy. Bettmann/Getty Images Bettmann/Getty Images Founder of Ebony magazine and Johnson Publishing Company John H. Johnson. Almost 15 years after the company was handed down to his daughter, JPC is filing for bankruptcy.
Bettmann/Getty Images Ebony magazine was more than a publication — to black America, it was a public trust. It held a place of prominence in millions of African-American households whose members did not otherwise see themselves in the mainstream media. So back in 2015, when Johnson Publishing Company announced it was spinning off its flagship magazine, Ebony , and also its news magazine sibling, Jet , people knew something was up.
""They were just waiting for the other shoe to drop,"" the late Ken Smikle, a longtime observer of the Johnson Publishing Company's evolution, told NPR's Michel Martin.
Smikle founded Target Market News, a Chicago-based service that tracks black consumer power and patterns for the business market. He felt JPC was in for a rough ride. This week, the other shoe finally dropped: JPC announced it was filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection. The company says it's selling the remainder of its assets, a comprehensive archive of photos from some of black America's most pivotal 20th Century moments , and a beloved cosmetics line that, toward the end, accounted for more than 40 percent of JPC's bottom line.
How did it get to this? Ebony has been around for so many decades, it saw the terminology for its target audience change from ""Colored"" to ""Negro"" to ""Black"" to ""African-American."" People thumbed through its glossy pages for stories of black success and achievement. Founder John H. Johnson used to say his magazines ""gave readers the feeling that there were black people in other cities and in other countries like themselves who were doing well,"" he told NPR in a 2002 interview. ""It inspired them to do better.""
So there were doctors and lawyers, entertainers and sportsmen, pastors and politicians — including ones from black countries. Ebony covered Ivorian president Félix Houphouët-Boigny's state visit to the White House in 1962, and put his glamorous new wife on the cover next to Jacqueline Kennedy. Mme. Houphouët-Boigny shone. Black America swooned. It was a high point.
Changing times ... and the Internet
But times had begun to change. The civil rights movement gave way to the Black Power movement. The old assimilationist aesthetic became challenged by the new Afrocentric aesthetic. People's reading habits changed. By the time the Internet became a thing, it was only a matter of time before online ads began to siphon dollars away from the ones magazines had been commanding. Subscriptions of Johnson publications started to dwindle. (Eventually Jet , the magazine that shocked America with the gruesome lynching photos of Emmett Till, went digital in 2014 to cut costs.)
John H. Johnson died in 2005, and by prearrangement, the reins passed to daughter Linda Johnson Rice. Although she was literally raised by John and wife Eunice in the JPC offices, and was familiar with the magazine's business and editorial practices, Rice was unprepared — as were many other publishers — for the rapid shifts in the publishing industry, the downsizing and mergers. And perhaps most of all, the loss of those critical advertising dollars to the dreaded Internet. In 2010, Rice sold the iconic JPC Tower on tony Michigan Avenue (designed by a black man, built for a black man, as locals proudly pointed out), to Columbia College, and moved the staff to smaller quarters. In 2016 she sold Ebony , Ebony.com and Jet.com to Clear View Ventures, a Texas-based, black-owned private equity firm that promised to "" position the enterprise for long-term growth . Our team,"" promised Clear View CEO Michael Gibson, ""has a true understanding of the Ebony brand as well as its legacy.""
Clear View had a less-than-clear understanding of the need to pay its freelance writers, who, because of the staff cuts and downsizing before the magazine's sale, had become Ebony 's lifeblood. After several entreaties, then demands for payment, a group of contributors went public with its complaint and sued for payment. Clear View settled before going to court , but not before an embarrassingly effective social media campaign made the new owners national news.
Not a good start.
Soon after, despite its intention to keep most of the staff, many were let go. The magazines remain in Clear View's hands.
Selling the remains
It isn't just the magazine people will miss. John Johnson's wife, Eunice, created a traveling fashion show that drew tens of thousands of mostly black women for decades. Ebony Fashion Fair established a theme each year, and featured black models who strutted down the runways in clothes by Yves Saint Laurent, Bill Blass and up-and-coming black designers like Stephen Burroughs and Patrick Kelly. Money from the popular show went to black nonprofit organizations. Fashion Fair Cosmetics, the first high-end cosmetics line for women of color to be sold in department stores, was born when Eunice Johnson noticed her models mixing their own makeup shades before they walked the runway. She consulted with chemists to develop luxury makeup in deeper tones, and by 1973, had them introduced in department stores — not drug stores. Fashion Fair had sold fantastically well when white cosmetics companies were only selling foundations and powder that went the gamut from pale to paler. Then, some people began to realize there was a great, untapped market out there, and it had a brown face.
By the 1990s, former makeup artist Bobbi Brown introduced her own line of foundations that included deeper shades for women of color . And there was more competition: Canadian company MAC brought a line to U.S. stores that also became quickly popular with women of color for its rich palette. Fashion Fair no longer had the field all to itself. Then mega cosmetics chains like Sephora and Ulta arrived, marketing both in ubiquitous brick and mortar stores and ... yes, the Internet. There were problems with distribution. And not much was put into social media campaigns.
Fashion Fair faltered. Its original pink compacts and lipstick tubes looked ... dowdy. The line was refreshed and reintroduced in sleek bronze packaging to great enthusiasm several years ago, but either there wasn't enough product being made or it wasn't being distributed widely. (Explanations vary.) The end result was bare shelves, much to the consternation of worried customers and beauty bloggers. Some stores gave up — they couldn't afford to hold a space for product they weren't sure was coming.
Makeup artist Lashelle Farrington made what amounts to a video obituary for Fashion Fair . As she makes up her face and explains which Fashion Fair products she's using and shows how to apply them, Farrington muses about the increasing difficulty of finding the product over the past year. ""I know that at the counter in my city, the person that works at the counter doesn't even know when they're going to get items in stock,"" she sighs.
JPC's move this week to file Chapter 7 is the final chapter in its storied history. If the tendered offer for the company's remaining assets is accepted, Fashion Fair and JPC's vast photo archive will be bought. And with that sale, whenever it occurs, the last vestiges of a vision that John H. Johnson made a reality for 77 years will come to an end."

SAGAL: ...Our new interactive quiz for your smart speaker. Just say open the Wait Wait Quiz, and Bill and I will be there to ask you some fill-in-the-blank questions. You can even win the voice of your choice on your voicemail.
Hi, you're on WAIT WAIT... DON'T TELL ME.
T J: Hey. This is T.J. (ph) calling in from Waterbury, Vt.
SAGAL: Hey. Waterbury is a great place. What do you do there?
T J: I groom ski trails for Sugar Bush terrain parks.
SAGAL: You're - so you're a ski guy. That's cool.
T J: I'm a snowboarder. But yeah, we're up there every night just laying down corduroy for the people.
SAGAL: That's really cool. You sound like a snowboarder. I'm just going to go there.
(LAUGHTER)
ALONZO BODDEN: I just want to ask - you live in Vermont. If you had a million dollars...
(LAUGHTER)
BODDEN: ...What would you do with it up there?
T J: Oh, man. I'd probably buy 400,000 snowboards.
SAGAL: Yeah, I was about to say.
(LAUGHTER)
BODDEN: All right.
MAEVE HIGGINS: Why wouldn't you just get one really big one, though?
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Well, T.J., welcome to the show. Bill Kurtis is going to read for you three news-related limericks with the last word or phrase missing from each. If you can fill in that last word or phrase correctly in two of the limericks, you'll be a winner. You ready to play?
T J: Yeah. Let's do it.
SAGAL: All right. Here is your first limerick.
BILL KURTIS: My pet is a bit of a brat. I'm the servant in his habitat. Those who own a sweet dog all live high on the hog. I feel lousy 'cause I have a...
T J: Cat.
SAGAL: Yes.
(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)
SAGAL: Dog owners are happier than cat owners.
(APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: It turns out it's been proven with a new survey showing how dog owners self-identify as very happy, whereas cat owners identify as very ow, why did it bite me again?
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: The survey found dog owners are happier than those with cats. The survey also found - and this is true - that people with cats are less happy than people who have no pets at all.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Now, that doesn't necessarily mean that cats make you unhappy. It may just be that cat owners are miserable losers for entirely different reasons.
(LAUGHTER)
NEGIN FARSAD: Can I just say #NotAllCats? Because...
(LAUGHTER)
FARSAD: I grew up with a really great cat that was basically like a dog. And now I have a dog, and there were like this - I can't even tell them apart. So just...
BODDEN: It's funny how cat people always say that.
SAGAL: Yeah, they always do.
(LAUGHTER)
BODDEN: No, no. My cat is different. No, it's not.
SAGAL: Yes.
(LAUGHTER)
BODDEN: No, it's a cat.
SAGAL: Yeah. Here is your next limerick.
KURTIS: For podcasts, we've got an idea. A Swedish voice sleep panacea. Now HEMNES and MALM will help you stay calm. Our podcast reads names from...
T J: IKEA.
SAGAL: Yes.
(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)
SAGAL: Very good.
(APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: Do you need a new sleep aid? Is our show no longer doing it for you? Ikea is launching a podcast made to help people go to sleep...
FARSAD: Oh, my god.
SAGAL: ...That's what it's for - in which two Swedish men read the names of products...
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: ...From the IKEA catalog, which is a great idea. It's much better than their original idea of reading from the illustrated assembly manual.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Because, like, I don't know, a man with a hammer is sad, and the corner of his table hurts. I...
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: The podcast is advertised as a great way to help people fall asleep. And if you listen to a clip, you can hear why.
(SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST)
UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: BJORKSNAS - chest of five drawers. PUDERVIVA - queen quilt cover set.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Swedish people reading an Ikea catalogue is truly the definition of white noise.
(APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: And if this isn't enough for you, you can turn into IKEA's next podcast from Guy Raz, How The Hell Do You Build This?
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: All right, T.J. Here is your last limerick.
KURTIS: On airplanes, the sound can be crushing when vacuum-sucked water is rushing. Since kids can be scared to use bathrooms mid-air, we have softened the noise of our...
T J: Flushing.
SAGAL: Flushing, right.
(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)
SAGAL: Physicists are working to improve airplane travel but not by making sure your plane doesn't crash. No, they're trying to make sure the toilet isn't too loud. People have been complaining for years about the deafening roar of the airplane toilet flush, saying it terrifies children and masks the other bathroom sounds they do want to hear.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Apparently, designing a quieter mechanism that can function at high altitudes has been a challenge. But engineers have found a way to cut the noise of the flush by 16 decibels - you just put your fingers in your ears...
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: ...Brace your elbows. Unfortunately, they haven't found a way to reduce the sound of the guy in the seat next to you who can't hear himself farting because his headphones are on.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Bill, how did T.J. do on our quiz?
KURTIS: Three and 0 - did very, very well.
SAGAL: Congratulations, T.J.
(APPLAUSE)
T J: Thank you.
SAGAL: Thanks so much for playing.

PETER SAGAL, HOST:
From NPR and WBEZ Chicago, this is WAIT WAIT... DON'T TELL ME, the NPR news quiz. I'm Bill Kurtis. We're playing this week with Maeve Higgins, Alonzo Bodden and Negin Farsad. And here again is your host from Trinity University's Laurie Auditorium in San Antonio, Peter Sagal.
(APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: Thank you, Bill. In just a minute, the rhymes of Texas are upon you in our listener limerick challenge. If you'd like to play, give us a call at 1-888-WAIT-WAIT - that's 1-888-924-8924.
Right now, panel, it is time for a game that we call...
BILL KURTIS: The 2020 dump.
SAGAL: With millions of Americans signing up each day to run for president as a Democrat...
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: ...News about all the candidates is coming in hard and fast. So we're going to ask you about some of them rapid-fire style. Get your question right, you get a point, true or false. Ready to go? Maeve, true or false - at a campaign event in Iowa, Beto O'Rourke got asked for his autograph while in the bathroom.
MAEVE HIGGINS: I would say that's true, actually.
SAGAL: No, it was false. What happened was Beto started talking to this stranger in the bathroom who then asked him, hey, are you here to see Beto O'Rourke?
(LAUGHTER)
HIGGINS: I was imagining that he kind of, like, off - you know, he seems to be very over-familiar. Like, and he gets up on countertops and stuff.
SAGAL: Yes.
HIGGINS: So I was imagining him at a u-rye-nal (ph) kind of stretching across to offer and...
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: I'm sorry, excuse me.
HIGGINS: ...To offer a shake.
ALONZO BODDEN: Yes, she did say...
SAGAL: At a what?
(LAUGHTER)
HIGGINS: U-rye-nal.
BODDEN: Beautiful.
NEGIN FARSAD: It's wrong.
BODDEN: You - no, that is the new way it's pronounced.
SAGAL: Yes. Oh, u-rye-nal.
(LAUGHTER)
HIGGINS: You know, the thing that men stand in front of.
SAGAL: Oh, I know what you're talking about. I've just never heard it...
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: ...Described that way. Is that what they call them in Ireland - a u-rye-nal?
HIGGINS: Yeah. Honestly, I've never used one. But...
(LAUGHTER)
HIGGINS: I know that they've got cakes in them, and I'm always so jealous.
SAGAL: That's true.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Negin, true or false. South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg and his husband Chasten were immortalized in a butter sculpture.
HIGGINS: (Laughter).
FARSAD: That feels true.
SAGAL: No, it's false. It was a diorama made of Marshmallow Peeps.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Alonzo, true or false. Former Virginia governor Terry McAuliffe, who's considering a run, tweeted out a picture of himself as a crab standing on the head of an alligator representing Donald Trump.
BODDEN: Oh, absolutely true.
SAGAL: Absolutely true. We have no idea what it means, but that's what he did.
(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)
SAGAL: Negin, true or false. Candidate Andrew Yang made empowering firefighters part of his official platform.
FARSAD: True.
SAGAL: No, false. He made empowering mixed martial arts fighters part of his official platform.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: And, of course, as for the Republican candidate in 2020, Alonzo, true or false - on a visit to George Washington's residence, Mount Vernon, President Trump said, I'm here to honor the legacy of President Vernon?
(LAUGHTER)
BODDEN: I'm going to go with true on that one also.
SAGAL: No. It's false. What he really said was, quote, ""if Washington was smart, he would have put his name on it. You got to put your name on stuff or no one remembers you.""
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: That's it for our 2020 dump, even though six more people declared while we were playing the game.
(APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: Right now, panel, some more questions for you from the week's news. Maeve, a woman in Taiwan suffering from what she thought was an eye infection learned of this week it was actually what?
HIGGINS: Oh, she was just obsessed.
SAGAL: No.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: She had been working at - does anybody know? This made a lot of news this week. People were, like...
FARSAD: Bumblebees in her...
SAGAL: Yes.
FARSAD: ...Eyeballs?
SAGAL: She had bees living in her eyes.
(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)
HIGGINS: Oh, there was a lot of buzz around this story.
SAGAL: There was, yeah. And the bees were feeding on her tears.
(GROANING)
SAGAL: No, we'll skip the gross parts - which means we will never speak of this again.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: No, these bees had gotten in there while she was gardening. And she started having some eye pain, as will happen, you know, when your eye has bees in them.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: She went to the doctor, and she got her first clue that there might be something seriously wrong when he approached her wearing a head-to-toe white suit and holding one of those smokers.
(LAUGHTER)
FARSAD: I thought he was, like, holding a piece of toast and, like, with butter...
(LAUGHTER)
FARSAD: ...And, like, making breakfast.
BODDEN: But how small were these bees?
SAGAL: These were tiny, little bees.
BODDEN: I didn't know bees...
FARSAD: Yeah.
BODDEN: ...Came in...
HIGGINS: Like humming-bees.
BODDEN: ...Eye-size.
SAGAL: Apparently...
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: They're small enough to fit in there, and she couldn't see them until they looked.
BODDEN: That's one more thing to worry about.
SAGAL: Yeah, I know.

PETER SAGAL, HOST:
Thank you, everybody. Thank you, Bill. Right now it is time for the WAIT WAIT... DON'T TELL ME Bluff The Listener game. Call 1-888-WAIT-WAIT to play our game in the air.
Hi, you are on WAIT WAIT... DON'T TELL ME.
DEVIN O'DONNELL: Hi. This is Devin O'Donnell (ph) from Salt Lake City, Utah.
SAGAL: Salt Lake City is a beautiful place. What do you do there, Devin?
O'DONNELL: So I work at a warehouse during the day, go to cosmetology school at night. And I also work as a drag performer here in the city.
SAGAL: Oh. What - can I ask what your...
(CHEERING, APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: I have a number of questions.
O'DONNELL: (Laughter).
SAGAL: First of all, what is your drag name?
O'DONNELL: It's Gemma Nai (ph).
SAGAL: Gemma Nai. OK.
(CHEERING)
O'DONNELL: Yeah.
(APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: Sounds exotic. And - so when you're in cosmetology school - you're going to be a hairstylist?
O'DONNELL: Yeah, absolutely - hair and makeup.
SAGAL: That's fabulous. Well, as a drag queen, you will absolutely be ready to do that.
O'DONNELL: Yep, it's what got me started.
(CHEERING)
SAGAL: When you think about it...
(APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: ...You want your stylist to be a drag queen.
NEGIN FARSAD: Mmm hmm.
O'DONNELL: Really.
SAGAL: All right.
O'DONNELL: Who knows better how to do makeup than someone who beats their face weekly?
SAGAL: That's true.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Well, Devin, it's nice to have you with us. You're going to play our game in which you must try to tell truth from fiction. What is the topic, Bill?
KURTIS: America, will you go to prom with me?
SAGAL: It's prom season. And that means two things - one, photos your children will regret forever and two, new prom trends. Our panelists are going to tell you about what's new at prom this year. Pick the one who's telling the truth, you'll win our prize - the WAIT WAITer of your choice on your voicemail. You ready to play?
O'DONNELL: Absolutely.
SAGAL: All right. Let's hear first, then, from Negin Farsad.
FARSAD: The 1990s hip-hop duo Kris Kross made an unlikely resurgence at Boise, Idaho's Centennial High School. You might remember them from that one hit jump, jump. The Daddy Mac'll make you jump...
MAEVE HIGGINS: (Laughter).
FARSAD: ...Jump. Kris Kross will make you...
(LAUGHTER)
FARSAD: ...Jump, jump. The Daddy Mac'll make you jump, jump.
(LAUGHTER)
FARSAD: I'm sure it was a huge hit with NPR audiences. Anyway...
(LAUGHTER)
FARSAD: ...You may also remember the curious fact that they wore their pants backwards. The kids at Centennial High could not get enough of Kris Kross and started dressing backwards on campus. While there were a few awkward adjustments at the boys urinal, school administrators viewed the whole thing as a passing throwback fad. But the trend continued to grow. And the senior class decided to make the theme of prom backward. So they renamed it morp (ph), which is prom backwards...
(LAUGHTER)
FARSAD: ...For those of you who lack backward-speaking facility. Not only did the students decide to dress backwards - long dress trains flowing forward on girls and corsages pinned on boys' backs - but they made everything backward. Morp night started with the after party, where students got exceedingly drunk and made mistakes they would soon regret for the rest of their lives.
(LAUGHTER)
FARSAD: As they danced through the night, they turned their moonwalks forward and their flossing upward. Their twerking had more chest and less booty. And their Gangnam style looked like a horse was riding them.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: The backwards prom.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Where everything is backwards, including the progression of events in Boise. Your next promposal will come from Alonzo Bodden.
ALONZO BODDEN: Is your prom really chaperoned when the chaperone is Charlie Sheen?
(LAUGHTER)
BODDEN: You might have to figure that out, especially as the trend of celebrity prom chaperones is spreading and also because Mr. Sheen is looking for work.
(LAUGHTER)
BODDEN: TMZ reporter Selena Jones (ph) says it started at Calabasas High School in Southern California. Now, Calabasas is well known as the home of the Kardashian family. One parent called in a favor from her friend Kris Jenner. And the next thing you know, Khloe Kardashian is at the prom, checking kids for alcohol. Not to be outdone, ICM super agent Ian Arougheti has a friend whose daughter is at Beverly Hills High School of the Arts. So now their prom will be monitored by Idris Elba.
HIGGINS: (Laughter).
BODDEN: Interestingly, there may be more mom volunteers than actual students at that.
(LAUGHTER)
BODDEN: News travels fast and even faster on Snapchat. LA kids bragging got Nashville kids jealous. So their parents got into the act. And now country stars Carrie Underwood and Reba McEntire will be at the Nashville High School senior prom, making sure the kids don't do anything that they'll have to later write country songs about.
(LAUGHTER)
BODDEN: Not to be outdone, New York started rumors of Jay-Z at a Brooklyn high school. But these were unfounded. So Brooklyn Tech will have to settle for Chris Rock.
(LAUGHTER)
BODDEN: All of this led to the nightmare scenario possibly coming true. Charlie Sheen, through his lawyers, asked if chaperoning the LA performing arts high school prom would count as part of his community service.
(LAUGHTER)
BODDEN: TMZ is waiting for the judge's decision.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Celebrity chaperones is the new trend.
(APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: Your last story of what's new under the sea comes from Maeve Higgins.
HIGGINS: This year's big prom trend is inspired by a texting fail. Teens across the country texted their dates to check what kind of corsage they wanted, only to find that their phones autocorrected the word corsage to croissant.
(LAUGHTER)
HIGGINS: Croissant. Seems like a rose by any other name is a pastry. Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen, a Dallas bakery, is now selling the croissant corsage after the quirky autocorrect mistake blew up on social media. So instead of wearing delicate carnations and pretty lilies, youngsters are getting their prom dates' corsages made from actual croissants. It's a lovely way to make memory and a grease stain that will last forever.
(LAUGHTER)
HIGGINS: Surely, this is just a first in a long line of carbohydrate accoutrements from - why is there so many French words?
(LAUGHTER)
HIGGINS: Surely, this is a first in a long line of carbohydrate accessories from bagel buttonholes, cupcake cufflinks and, of course, a cumber sticky bun.
(LAUGHTER)
HIGGINS: It's all part of a lovely trend of having some fun and providing gluten-intolerant people with yet another activity they can't participate in.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: All right. Which of these...
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: ...Is a real prom theme or trend this year? Was it from Negin, the backwards prom or morp, in which everything happens backwards; from Alonzo, celebrity chaperones, a famous person standing there at the door for you or from Maeve Higgins, kids wearing croissants instead of corsages because of an autocorrect failure? Which of these is the real story of a prom trend?
O'DONNELL: Well, I think I'm going to go with the croissant corsage.
SAGAL: You're going to go with the croissant crosage (ph). I can't even say it - the croissant - croissant corsage.
HIGGINS: Croissant corsage.
SAGAL: All right. Well, to bring you the correct answer, we spoke to someone playing a role in the real story.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
JOHN FELTON: They would be asking a prom dates what kind of corsage they wanted. And autocorrect on their phone would change that text to croissant.
(APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: That was John Felton from Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen, which is making croissant corsages for this year's promgoers. Congratulations, Devin. You got it right.
(CHEERING, APPLAUSE)
O'DONNELL: Yeah. Thank you.
SAGAL: You earned a point for Maeve for her...
HIGGINS: Thanks, Devin.
SAGAL: ...Pronunciation of croissant.
HIGGINS: (Laughter).
SAGAL: And you've won our prize, the voice of your choice on your voicemail. Thank you so much for playing with us.
O'DONNELL: Thank you. This was amazing.

PETER SAGAL, HOST:
Panelists, now some questions about the rest of the week's news for you. Alonzo, a tourist getting a ride in a fighter jet in France got the full experience when the pilot accidentally did what?
ALONZO BODDEN: Ejected him.
SAGAL: Yes, that's what happened...
(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)
NEGIN FARSAD: What?
SAGAL: ...You know, the whole thing with the canopy blowing off and the seat rocketing into the air. Don't worry. He parachuted safely to the runway below. French authorities say he's fine. Or wait - French authorities actually said, quote, ""his health is not a cause for concern.""
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Weirdly, that's exactly what the same guy who rented the island had to say.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: The 64-year-old man was riding along in a French Air Force fighter jet, which isn't supposed to eject passengers just because it feels like it. It's not a nightclub. It's a fighter jet.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Most likely - nobody knows exactly what happened, but most likely, the passenger came close to fulfill his lifelong dream of having his last words be, what does this button do?
(LAUGHTER)
BODDEN: Peter, as someone who used to work on fighter planes, I think that's exactly what happened. I think he saw that red lever and said, I wonder what this does?
SAGAL: Yeah.
BODDEN: And then he found out.
SAGAL: Maybe this fires the guns...
BODDEN: (Laughter).
SAGAL: ...Or something cool.
BODDEN: But that is the ultimate - I mean, you know, it's great to get a ride in a fighter jet, but it has to kind of be cooler to even be ejected from a fighter jet.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: I know.
BODDEN: Imagine being at a party, and some guy's bragging that, yeah, man, I was riding in a fighter jet. Oh, you were only riding in one?
SAGAL: Oh, yeah.

Hi, you're on WAIT WAIT... DON'T TELL ME.
MEGAN DOHERTY: Hi Peter. This is Megan Doherty (ph) from Oberlin, Ohio.
SAGAL: Oberlin, Ohio, Megan, is home, of course, of Oberlin University.
(APPLAUSE)
DOHERTY: Oberlin College.
SAGAL: Oh, excuse me - Oberlin College. Do you have any affiliation with Oberlin College?
DOHERTY: I am a campus rabbi.
SAGAL: Oh, you are. So you work at the Hillel.
DOHERTY: I am.
SAGAL: Yeah.
DOHERTY: I do.
SAGAL: Yeah. And how...
DOHERTY: I do.
SAGAL: And how do you find that work?
DOHERTY: It's really fun.
SAGAL: The characters on Lena Dunham's show ""Girls"" were all Oberlin graduates. Was that true to life in terms of what they're like?
DOHERTY: I have never seen ""Girls.""
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Given your job, I wouldn't recommend it.

DOHERTY: Thank you.
SAGAL: Let me introduce you to our panel this week. First, the comedian and host of the podcast ""Fake The Nation."" It's just been nominated for a Webby Award for news and politics. It's Negin Farsad.

DOHERTY: Hello.
SAGAL: Next, a comedian you can see in Philadelphia at the Helium Comedy Club on April 18 through the 20, Alonzo Bodden.
ALONZO BODDEN: Hello.

SAGAL: And finally, a comedian whose new book ""Maeve In America"" is out now. It's Maeve Higgins.
MAEVE HIGGINS: Hi.
(CHEERING)
SAGAL: Megan, welcome to the show. You're going to play Who's Bill This Time. Bill Kurtis is going to read for you three quotations from this week's news. If you can correctly identify or explain two of them, you'll win our prize - any voice from our show you might choose on your voicemail. You ready to play?
DOHERTY: Yep.
SAGAL: Here we go. Here's your first quote.
KURTIS: From Congress, I would ask for wall. We need wall.
SAGAL: That was a quote from a woman who got fired last week - and despite doing her best to get wall for the president.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Who is it?
DOHERTY: Kirstjen unpronounceable last name...
SAGAL: Yes.
DOHERTY: ...Nielsen.
SAGAL: Kirstjen unpronounceable last name...
(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)
SAGAL: ...Nielsen, actually.
(CHEERING)
SAGAL: You can pronounce it. You just can't spell it. The now former secretary of homeland security is the latest victim of the president's cabinet separation policy.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: It's an everyone-must-go sale at the White House. The president...
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: ...Also got rid of the guy who was supposed to head up ICE, the acting director. He's out. He wanted someone who was, quote, ""tougher."" And he fired the head of the Secret Service right while the guy was diving in front of him, yelling, no.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: So now we have an acting secretary of defense, an acting homeland security secretary, an acting chief of staff and an acting head of the Secret Service. There are more actors in the president's cabinet...
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: ...Than there are in the wait staff of a Los Angeles restaurant.
(APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: You know what would be even better, though? An overacting secretary of defense.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: You realize, of course, this means war.
(LAUGHTER)
BODDEN: My favorite thing about Kirstjen Nielsen being the homeland security director, being anti-immigrant and everything else, is she spells Kirstjen with a J...
SAGAL: Yeah.
BODDEN: ...In the middle. Like, that's not American.
SAGAL: No, not at all.
(LAUGHTER)
BODDEN: Where you get that J from? What?
SAGAL: It's tough because, you know, you leave the Trump administration. You get fired. It's terrible. Your reputation is ruined. People yell at you wherever you go. And you know what the Trump administration's idea of COBRA benefits is to tie you into a sack with a cobra.
(LAUGHTER)
NEGIN FARSAD: But the thing about having all these acting secretaries...
SAGAL: Yeah.
FARSAD: ...Is that they're basically like temps. They're like substitute teachers.
SAGAL: Right.
FARSAD: Which means that our government is just a bunch of people doing whoopie cushion jokes and throwing spit wads at acting cabinet members. Like, it's chaos.
SAGAL: Yeah, that's true. Today at the Pentagon, they're just showing a movie.
FARSAD: Right, exactly.
(APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: All right, Megan. Your next quote is someone who is known for attacking millionaires and billionaires.
KURTIS: I wrote a bestselling book. If you write a bestselling book, you can be a millionaire, too.
SAGAL: That is the new Democratic front-runner according to polls. Who is it?
DOHERTY: That was Bernie Sanders.
SAGAL: It was Bernie Sanders.
(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)
SAGAL: Senator Sanders caused a bit of a stir this week because the guy who for years has been saying we've had enough of our country being run by millionaires and billionaires revealed that he is, in fact, a millionaire - which is surprising because most millionaires can afford haircuts.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: We should have known things were changing for him economically when his stump speech changed to (imitating Bernie Sanders) we've had enough of our country being run by billionaires and zillionaires.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: But Bernie has promised not to enjoy the money because in his entire life, he has never enjoyed anything.
(LAUGHTER)
HIGGINS: I just can't believe he got rich from writing a book because everybody I know who's written a book is so broke.
SAGAL: That's true.
(LAUGHTER)
FARSAD: And also, like, what can you buy in Vermont for a millionaire?
BODDEN: I think with a million dollars in Vermont, you can buy, like, half of Vermont.
SAGAL: It's true.
HIGGINS: Yeah.
SAGAL: By the way, this is all in preparation for Bernie releasing his tax returns. Did you know that Bernie has not released his tax returns? Didn't do it in 2016. He says he's going to do it next week. He's the perfect candidate for people who both hate President Trump and are kind of jealous of Republicans for having him. Why can't liberals have an angry, old man with terrible hair who won't release his tax returns?
(LAUGHTER)
BODDEN: I'm sitting here, Peter, trying to think of a joke that shows I care about rich, white men, but I've got nothing.
SAGAL: I know.
(LAUGHTER, CHEERING)
BODDEN: I've got...
FARSAD: It's tough.
BODDEN: I've got - listen. It's one more time...
FARSAD: I know.
BODDEN: ...White people complaining about, oh, man, I'd have made a million dollars. I don't know how to help you on that one.
SAGAL: Yeah, I know.
(LAUGHTER)
BODDEN: Good luck with that. Yeah.
SAGAL: Megan, here is your last quote.
KURTIS: Einstein must be totally chuffed.
SAGAL: That was a very happy astronomer quoted in The New York Times talking about the first-ever photograph ever made of a what?
DOHERTY: A black hole.
SAGAL: A black hole.
(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)
SAGAL: Yes.
(APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: This week, we got to look at the first-ever photo of an actual massive, interstellar black hole in a galaxy known as Messier 87 about 55 million light years away. It looks like a - well, a black hole surrounded by a ring of orange light like the eye of Sauron or a...
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: ...Really, really evil bagel.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Nonetheless, the photo was a scientific triumph. It was unlike anything anyone had ever seen - except for the people who asked for photos of their colonoscopies. Interestingly...
(LAUGHTER)
HIGGINS: Wait, is that what...
SAGAL: It made us think of that - all I can tell you.
FARSAD: How many colonoscopy...
BODDEN: Yeah.
FARSAD: ...Photos...
BODDEN: I guess.
FARSAD: ...Do you look at, Peter?
SAGAL: Well, you know.
FARSAD: (Laughter).
SAGAL: Interestingly - and this is pretty cool - because of the time it takes the light to get here - 55 million years - the photo is the black hole when it was much younger than it is now. So what do you know? The black hole is just like everyone on Tinder.
(LAUGHTER)
FARSAD: My first thought when I saw that photo was, like, wow, that's a really great use of portrait mode...
SAGAL: Yeah.
FARSAD: ...You know? So the...
BODDEN: That's why really - I really feel happy for those astrophysicists and the other science - the geniuses who spend their whole life studying and working, and they can finally say, that's what I do. This is what I do. Like...
SAGAL: Here you go.
BODDEN: People have always - what do you do at work?
(APPLAUSE)
BODDEN: This is what I do.
SAGAL: And this is really cool. It turns out that in order to take this picture of this extraordinarily distant object that there's no single telescope that's strong enough to do it. So they had to get data from telescopes all around the world and combine them in an incredibly complicated way figured out by a 29-year-old astrophysicist named Rachel (ph).
(CHEERING)
SAGAL: And they say that the precision of this virtual instrument they created was so precise they could see an orange on the moon - which makes you say, why are they going on about a black hole? There are oranges on the moon.
(LAUGHTER)
FARSAD: When I was reading about this, I read, like, if you were - they were trying to explain what happens if you go into the black hole.
SAGAL: Right.
FARSAD: And so you pass through the event horizon unscathed. And then you get to this point where the black hole stretches you like a noodle.
SAGAL: Yes.
FARSAD: Which, for a minute, I was, like, I'm OK with that as someone...
(LAUGHTER)
FARSAD: ...Who might use, like, body distortion filters on...
SAGAL: Yeah.
FARSAD: ...Insta...
SAGAL: Yeah.
FARSAD: ...That, like, you kind of go...
SAGAL: For a...
FARSAD: ...Like, your skinniest.
SAGAL: For an instant, a microsecond...
FARSAD: Yeah, for a microsecond...
SAGAL: You'll finally be a size one.
FARSAD: You're, like, super tall and skinny.
SAGAL: Yeah.
FARSAD: Exactly. That's kind of into that.
SAGAL: Yeah. That would be cool.
HIGGINS: But then do you just disintegrate?
FARSAD: And then you're dead.
HIGGINS: Worth it.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Bill, how did Megan do on our quiz?
KURTIS: She got them all right. She is a winner.
SAGAL: Megan, thank you so much for playing.
(APPLAUSE)
DOHERTY: Thank you.
SAGAL: Bye-bye.
DOHERTY: Goodbye.

Not My Job: We Quiz Journalist Dan Rather On What He Actually Said,www.npr.org,,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/13/712576151/not-my-job-we-quiz-journalist-dan-rather-on-what-he-actually-said,"Enlarge this image Robin Marchant/Getty Images for AWXI Robin Marchant/Getty Images for AWXI We recorded the show in San Antonio, Texas, this week and invited journalist Dan Rather — Texas native and resident — to play our quiz. In addition to reporting on pretty much every major event of the last half century, Rather is also famous for ""Ratherisms"" — folksy sayings combining colorful metaphors with colorful wisdom. He's used so many of them, we're curious to see if he can pick out what he really said from the ones that we just made up.
Click the audio link above to hear how he does.
PETER SAGAL, HOST:
And now the game where people live a rich, full life and yet somehow end up with us.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: If all the major events of the late 20th century had a single thing in common, it might be this. They were reported on by Dan Rather. He was at Dealey Plaza...
(APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: ...When Kennedy was shot. He reported from Vietnam. He challenged Nixon on Watergate. He covered the Cold War and was there to cover its end. He is a proud Texas native and still a resident. We are honored to have him with us.
Dan Rather, welcome to WAIT WAIT... DON'T TELL ME.
DAN RATHER: Thank you very much.
(APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: So you still have a home here in Texas. You grew up here in Texas. You're a Texan.
RATHER: I was born in Wharton, Texas. I grew up in Houston, and I'm not just from Texas. I am of Texas.
SAGAL: You are a Texan.
(APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: You started - and it turns out that many reporters, including Bill, started this way. You were a local guy. You - at one - you were doing minor league baseball games at one point.
RATHER: I did. I once - I've always been interested in news. But once to supplement my income at its lower levels, you know, broadcasting doesn't pay all that well. So I did play-by-play as a way of supplementing my income. I did play-by-play football and baseball, basketball, track. Track is really difficult to do play-by-play from...
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: All right. Wait a minute. How would you do that? Well, he's running.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: He seems to be running more.
RATHER: Or he's vaulting, or he has this shot put in his hand. And he takes five steps, and he throws.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Do you think there's one moment that - in which you sort of got your start that started your career that we've all sort of been watching lo these many decades?
RATHER: Well, I do. That - there was a great hurricane in 1961, Hurricane Carla, which was at that time and I think still the largest in terms of sheer size hurricane on record in the Gulf of Mexico. And I had just started in television. I had made my move from radio into television. I was still new to television. And we wound up in the right place at the right time on Galveston Island as the hurricane came in. And that was picked up by other stations. Nobody else was there broadcasting. So if I had to point to one moment that sort of, quote, ""made my career,"" that was probably it.
SAGAL: Yeah, it's funny because Bill got his sort of start with a great tornado in Kansas.
BILL KURTIS: Tornado - same thing. You have to be there.
SAGAL: It turns out maybe these weather events are being caused by ambitious, young reporters.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: You were known and - for many things but certainly for being fearless, not only the places you went, like war zones, but also the way you treated people in power. There was a famous incident where you got up, and you asked President Nixon a question. It was during Watergate. And he didn't like it. And I believe he said, are you running for something? And your famous response was...
RATHER: No, sir, Mr. President. Are you?
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: That's pretty good. You, of course, took over as the anchor of the ""CBS Evening News,"" taking the baton from Walter Cronkite, another legend who, I guess, took it from Edward R. Murrow. So you're part of that line. And one of the things that people were noticing as you settled into that role was you were looking for your signoff because famously, of course, Cronkite would end his broadcast, well, that's the way it is on this day.
RATHER: Right.
SAGAL: And what was your thinking? You said, I needed something different? You needed something for yourself?
RATHER: Well, it was suggested to me that you need a signoff.
SAGAL: Yeah.
RATHER: But you know what? Following a legend like that is not the easiest thing in the world (laughter). At any rate, my first suggestion was maybe I can say, well, that's some of the way it is.
SAGAL: Yeah, OK. That's not bad.
(LAUGHTER)
RATHER: Nobody took to that idea. We tried to. But at any rate...
SAGAL: That's the way it might be.
(LAUGHTER)
RATHER: Doesn't have quite the same ring.
SAGAL: No, not at all.
RATHER: But at any rate, I was thinking, you know, my father's - late father's favorite word was courage for a lot of reasons. So I thought, well, maybe we could just pause and say, you know, and that's the ""CBS Evening News"" - Dan Rather reporting courage. And the more I thought about it, the more I kind of liked it because it had a nostalgic ring for me. I will say that the executives in the company were horrified that this whole...
SAGAL: Really.
(LAUGHTER)
RATHER: So it lasted about a week. And at the end of that week, it was pretty much you either stop using this as a signoff, or we stop using you.
SAGAL: Whoa.
RATHER: So it was an easy decision.
SAGAL: I understand. And what did you change to?
RATHER: I just decided not to have one.
SAGAL: Yeah, just went with the plain goodnight.
RATHER: I've giving it my best shot, didn't work out. So we...
SAGAL: There you go. I know. Hey, we could talk to you about your career all night, but out of all the people you've interviewed - and you interviewed just about every, you know, major historical player in the last 50 years - was there a particular favorite, somebody who you were glad to talk to?
RATHER: Well, I'm glad you put the preface because let's face it - I've been lucky and mightily blessed. I could give you the names maybe seven people. But if I had to pick one, it would be I was assigned - my first major assignment for CBS News was to cover Dr. Martin Luther King and what was then the emerging civil rights movement.
(APPLAUSE)
RATHER: Covering Dr. King changed me as a professional, and it changed me as a person. And for that reason, I would say if I had to pick one, I would say interviewing Dr. Martin Luther King and covering him day to day for almost two years.
SAGAL: Wow. Sure. I imagine that's - I'm envious that you had the chance.
(APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: Do you ever - when you're watching whomever, do you ever, like, miss it? Are you ever like, if I was there, I would have the questions?
RATHER: Like every second.
SAGAL: Yeah, I know.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: I can imagine. Well, Dan Rather, it is an absolute honor to talk to you, but today we have, in fact, asked you here to play a game we're calling...
KURTIS: This game is tougher than the hide of an armadillo in the hot sun that forgot its sunblock.
SAGAL: As I'm sure you know, you are famous for what people call Ratherisms, folksy sayings with colorful metaphors and colorful wisdom. You've used so many of them over your career. We want to see if you can pick the one you actually came up with....
(LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: ...From some fake ones that we made up in tribute to you. So if you can do that two times out of three, you'll win a prize for one of our listeners.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Bill, who is Dan Rather playing for?
KURTIS: Corey Henderstine (ph) of Washington, D.C.
SAGAL: All right. Here's your first Ratherism. This was when you were covering the 2000 election. And did you say, A, this race is tight like a too-small bathing suit in a too-long ride home from the beach...
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: ...B, Poppa, wear your good suit because we got ourselves a tie...
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: ...Or C, this race is tighter than Aunt Tilly after a third Moscow Mule.
(LAUGHTER)
RATHER: Definitely A.
SAGAL: It was definitely A.
(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)
SAGAL: I've always wondered before we move - did you just make those up off the top of your head? Or did you, like, have them ready to go?
RATHER: Well, in the beginning, they came from working in the oil fields when I was a kid. This is the way men talk with one another.
SAGAL: You have got to be kidding me.
(LAUGHTER)
RATHER: Oh, absolutely. You know, you can only say it's hot as hell so many times.
SAGAL: Yeah, I guess so. Yeah.
(LAUGHTER)
RATHER: So as the day wears on, you say, you know, it's hotter than a Laredo parking lot or some way to use colorful language.
SAGAL: All right. We have two more. You did well with that one. This is now - we're moving through time to the election of 2004. That was George W. Bush re-elected versus John Kerry. During that evening's coverage on CBS, did you say, A, John Kerry's wife might own Heinz, but this is one night he won't catch up...
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: ...B, we used to say if a frog had side pockets, he'd carry a handgun; or C, it all comes down to O-H-I-O, which stands for, oh, hi, it's over.
(LAUGHTER)
RATHER: Definitely B.
SAGAL: Yes, if a frog...
(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)
SAGAL: ...Had side pockets, he'd carry a handgun. I think you're doing really well.
(APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: Here's your last question. This is a great metaphor you used while commenting on the 2016 election. Was it, A, this race is a back country tilt-a-whirl - it could go either way; B, like the talking horse said to the hopping bull, I can't believe what I'm seeing...
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: ...Or C, if Clinton wins Florida, this race will go faster than a ""Hamilton"" ticket at face value.
RATHER: I don't recall saying any of those.
SAGAL: Really? Do you know which one you wish you had said?
(LAUGHTER)
RATHER: I guess that would be B.
SAGAL: You'd be B, like the talking horse said to the hopping bull. It is a good one, but the one that we were told you said if Clinton wins Florida, this race will go faster than a ""Hamilton"" ticket at face value, which I thought was great because you're updating your cultural references.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Meanwhile, Bill, how did your old friend Dan do on our quiz?
KURTIS: Well, he had won anyway. Two out of three is a big win for us.
(APPLAUSE)
KURTIS: Good going.
SAGAL: Dan Rather is a legend of broadcast news and the creator of News and Guts Media. The new season of ""The Big Interview With Dan Rather"" starts April 16 at 8 p.m. on AXS.
Dan Rather, thank you for being with us. Thank you.
(APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: Dan Rather, everyone.
RATHER: Thank you.
(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""(AIN’T THAT) GOOD NEWS"")
SAM COOKE: (Singing) Ain't that good news? Man, ain't that news? Baby's coming home tomorrow.
SAGAL: In just a minute, we finally settle that whole cat versus dog debate in our Listener Limerick Challenge. Call 1-888-WAIT-WAIT to join us on the air. We'll be back in a minute with more of WAIT WAIT... DON'T TELL ME from NPR.

"After Coachella Premiere, Childish Gambino's Film 'Guava Island' Is Streaming",www.npr.org,,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/13/713028614/after-coachella-premiere-childish-gambinos-film-guava-island-is-streaming,"Enlarge this image Donald Glover in a still from Guava Island , which he stars in with Rihanna. The film premiered at Coachella, where Glover's musical act Childish Gambino headlined on Friday. courtesy of Amazon Prime Video courtesy of Amazon Prime Video Donald Glover in a still from Guava Island , which he stars in with Rihanna. The film premiered at Coachella, where Glover's musical act Childish Gambino headlined on Friday.
courtesy of Amazon Prime Video Guava Island , Childish Gambino 's long-awaited new project, has finally arrived. Hot off a headlining Coachella performance Friday night, Guava Island is the proverbial cherry on top of Donald Glover's wildly successful year as a rapper, following his first Billboard No. 1 with ""This Is America"" in 2018 and that song's wins for Song of the Year and Record of the Year at the Grammy awards earlier this year — the first rap song to ever win both those prizes.
Anticipation for Guava Island was first stoked months in advance with a single photo of Glover and Rihanna on set in Cuba, spurring grandiose speculation as to what the project would entail — especially since it's tied to Glover's retirement of the Childish Gambino project. Longtime collaborator Hiro Murai directed (Murai is also the director of the ""This Is America"" video and many episodes of Glover's TV series Atlanta ) and the screenplay was written by Stephen Glover, Donald's brother and a writer on Atlanta.
Almost as if to curtail the expectations, the film itself is a modestly stunning — and at times unnerving — extended music video, shot in 4:3 aspect ratio, about music's power to unite in the face of tyranny and greed. It features three new songs, ""Die With You,"" ""Time"" and the flamenco-tinged ""Saturday,"" as well as renditions of the previously released ""Summertime Magic,"" ""Feels Like Summer"" and notably, a sequence showcasing ""This Is America"" that recalls Murai's music video from last year.
A quick summary of the plot: Glover stars as Deni Maroon, a Purple Rain-esque folk hero and local celebrity on the island — exploited for its natural splendor and transformed into a factory spinning silk run by a single despot, played by Nonso Anozie. Rihanna plays his partner, Kofi Novia. The pair meets in a gorgeous animated backstory at the start of the film. Deni's set on uniting the island with a music festival, but it comes at a cost. Black Panther's Letitia Wright also plays a role.
YouTube
Guava Island is streaming on Amazon for free today until 9 p.m. EST. After that time, it'll be available only to Amazon Prime members. It will also stream once on YouTube's Coachella live stream , starting at 8 p.m ET / 5 p.m. PT."

He spoke to Fresh Air in 2016 about the story behind the title of his hit sit-com Everybody Loves Raymond.
Television Ray Romano Gets Deep, Dark And Angsty For Martin Scorsese's 'Vinyl' Hear The Original Interview DAVID BIANCULLI, HOST:
This is FRESH AIR. I'm David Bianculli, in for Terry Gross. Comic, actor and writer Ray Romano has been plying his craft for a long time and is still finding new ways to challenge himself. He's most famous as the star of the CBS sitcom ""Everybody Loves Raymond,"" one of the most successful recent examples of the old-fashioned multi-camera TV sitcom. But he's also challenged himself as an actor, starring in such dramatic roles as a man with a midlife crisis in TNT's ""Men Of A Certain Age,"" a photographer on the autism spectrum in NBC's ""Parenthood"" and a record promoter in HBO's ""Vinyl.""
Terry Gross spoke to Ray Romano in 2016, the year ""Vinyl"" premiered. This year, Ray Romano returned to the format that got him started - stand-up comedy in a Netflix special called ""Ray Romano: Right Here, Around the Corner."" It was his first stand-up special in 23 years. Here he is on the topic of being a father of a 16-year-old son.
(SOUNDBITE OF COMEDY SPECIAL, ""RAY ROMANO: RIGHT HERE, AROUND THE CORNER"")
RAY ROMANO: And now he drives. Why do we give 16-year-olds licenses? My son doesn't care about anything. He called me today like, hey, Dad, I'm in the car. Yeah, I don't know. I guess I'm out of gas right now.
(LAUGHTER)
ROMANO: What do you mean you don't know, Joe? Are you moving?
(LAUGHTER)
ROMANO: Is the car moving? I'm not moving. I'm not moving. I put my foot on the pedal, I'm not going anywhere right now. All right. Well, all right. Where are you, Joe? And he's very calm, now, he's la-de-da (ph). I'm here. I'm on the 101. The 101 is a five-lane highway.
(LAUGHTER)
ROMANO: Nothing. So I assume, like anybody would, oh, you're on the side of the road, now? No, I'm in the middle lane right now.
(LAUGHTER)
ROMANO: What do you mean, Joe? Where's the urgency? I swear to you, this is the exchange 'cause I'm panicking now. What's the traffic like? Well, behind me, it's bad. But it's moving in front of me.
(LAUGHTER)
ROMANO: I'm going to kick your ass, Joe, 'cause you need fear. You need fear in your life.
(LAUGHTER)
ROMANO: And my wife tries to spin it. You know, whatever he does, she puts the spin on it. Well, he doesn't panic. He's Zen. He's a very Zen-like boy, like astronauts. Maybe he'll be an astronaut one day. Oh, you think so? Really? I don't want to burst your bubble, but if he can't interpret the gas gauge on a Mazda...
(LAUGHTER)
ROMANO: ...No, he ain't getting in a space shuttle, I'll tell you right now. Give that up.
BIANCULLI: It was 24 years ago, in 1995, when David Letterman gave Ray Romano his big break by inviting him to do stand-up on ""The Late Show."" A week later, Ray got a call from Letterman's production company, saying they were interested in creating a sitcom around him, which turned out to be the show ""Everybody Loves Raymond."" Here's that 1995 stand-up routine from Romano's original appearance on ""Letterman.""
(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, ""LATE SHOW WITH DAVID LETTERMAN"")
ROMANO: I have a 3-year-old daughter and twin 2-year-old boys.
(LAUGHTER)
ROMANO: Wow. Thank you. Single people are here.
(LAUGHTER)
ROMANO: Single people are like, yay, twins. Parents - oh, that could have been us. Oh, my God.
(LAUGHTER)
ROMANO: I'll tell you. You know, it doesn't matter if you laugh or not. I'm just happy to be out of the house right now. I'll be honest with you.
(LAUGHTER)
ROMANO: I will be honest. You know, it's horrible. I make little excuses now just to get out of my house for a few minutes. I'll do anything. Anybody, do you need anything? Anything at all, anything?
(LAUGHTER)
ROMANO: Anything from the motor vehicle bureau? How about that?
(LAUGHTER)
ROMANO: Can I register something? It's on my way. I'm going that way. I'm just going to go apply for jury duty, that's all. Let me out.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)
TERRY GROSS, BYLINE: So when David Letterman had you on the show for the first time in 1995, and he...
ROMANO: Yeah.
GROSS: ...Was so taken with your comedy that he wanted to build a sitcom around you, you must have been shocked.
ROMANO: Yeah. They called my house, by the way. I lived in Queens. I was in a small house in Queens. And it was a Saturday. First of all, who's calling your house - what executive producer from the show is calling you at your house, and not your manager or agent, and on a Saturday?
And here's where I was. I was - I had been doing stand-up for 11 years. I did Johnny Carson in 1991. I did Leno a couple times. I did every stand-up show they had, ""Evening At The Improv,"" the MTV - all those shows. I had my own HBO half-hour, and I loved doing it. I loved doing stand-up.
I was happy to be doing what I loved, but I was - I kind of reached a plateau, I guess, of where I was going to go. And if that's all I did for the rest of my career, you know, it's - it doesn't suck to be doing what you love to do. And Letterman, after I'd done my Letterman set, I kind of thought, well, that was a really good set. So let's see if it had - you know, maybe somebody? And it was Letterman. It was Letterman who was watching from 20 feet away.
And they called me. And I remember my wife saying, Rob Burnett's on the phone. I was in the backyard. I don't know what I was doing. I was hosing off the kids. And I picked the phone up. I was kind of surprised. And he said, listen, Dave liked what he saw. And so we just want to - we just want to say, I just want to tell you that we're interested. So let's see what happens.
Just know, don't - before you sign anything else with anybody else, we're interested. And then, right away - I told them right there, nobody's - there is nobody else. You know, if you're interested, I'm interested. And sure enough, we signed a deal. And here I am.
GROSS: (Laughter) You know, in watching back your appearance - your last appearance on the Letterman show, you started to tear up. Your voice cracked on that.
ROMANO: Yeah, I did.
GROSS: You got very emotional because he had, you know, giving you the green light to have a sitcom. I mean, he really changed your life so profoundly. That show was so successful.
ROMANO: Yeah. Yeah, I'm getting emotional now when I think about it. But yeah, it's true. Look; there are many things that happened in my life. There are many milestones. There are many things that got me to where I am but none more so than the five minutes I did on ""Letterman"" that night. And then I did - you know, for the next 20 years, I was on his show at least once - sometimes twice. And then - so for him - when he was retiring, it was something. I mean, it changed my life. It changed my children's life. I mean, I'd still like to think we'd be the same people. I think I am - but so many more opportunities. So just to see him go away into - yeah. I mean, it all kind of welled up in me.
I'll tell you one little story. I'm kind - I'm a kind of superstitious guy - and sometimes too superstitious. But the night that I did the first ""Letterman,"" he was doing a bit about - it was springtime, so he was doing a bit about cutting your pants - summer-izing (ph) your pants. And he took someone from the audience, and he cut their pants into shorts. And then he took Paul Schaefer, and he cut Paul Schaefer's pants into shorts. And then Mel Gibson was the first guest. And he took Mel Gibson's, and he cut his. And then he said, well, I've got to do mine. And he cut his own pants into shorts.
So I was backstage, and I'm watching this. And you know - so I'm talking with my manager (unintelligible). And we're like - and I'm like, should I - do I cut my pants? Do I go out with my pants? And they're like, you've got to do it (laughter). And one of the one of the writers - producers came over with, like, scissors and says, well, you've got to go out - when they introduce you, you've got to go out with your pants cut. And I - we literally were - I had the scissors in my hand. I'm making a big deal out of this, and I probably shouldn't.
But I had the scissors in my hand, and we were ready to cut my pants into shorts. So when Dave Letterman announces this new comic - Ray Romano, here he is - and I walk out, you're going to see my bare calves and knees and I'm part of the joke. And at the last second, I thought, I'm not going to do it. I'm going to just - I don't want to assume I'm part of the clique. I'm part of - you know, I'm the - they don't even know who I am. And now I'm going to go out and be in on the joke. And I don't know. It's too presumptuous; it's too whatever. So I decided not to.
And I went out, and I had the - what I thought was probably one of my best TV sets. And it turned into this - and I still believe had I cut those pants into shorts, the dynamic - something's different. Maybe I have a good set, but there's something. And who knows whether or not all of this happens if I cut my pants into shorts?
GROSS: Well, that's really interesting.
ROMANO: (Laughter).
GROSS: You know what? I'm - here's part of the - how the dynamic might have been different. It would have not only been that, like, you were in on the joke - you know, a part of the clique or whatever. But the audience's first reaction to you would've been like - oh, he's got bony legs or something like that, or, like, doesn't he look funny in those foolish looking shorts that used to be pants a few minutes ago.
ROMANO: Yes, it's distracting. It's distracting.
GROSS: And it takes away from thinking - oh, it's a new comic. I wonder what he's going to talk about.
ROMANO: I don't know if you're kidding or not, but I think...
GROSS: No, I'm not kidding.
ROMANO: ...You're absolutely right.
GROSS: No, I mean that sincerely. Like, it would've...
ROMANO: Well, good. You're...
GROSS: ...Been so off-topic to distract people into thinking about, like, your bony legs and laughing at that when you had, like, genuine comedy to deliver.
ROMANO: Well, I want to say two things. One, I have - my bottom half of my legs are...
GROSS: I didn't mean to assume about your legs (laughter).
ROMANO: ...Fantastic. But that might have been distracting - that they're too good looking. But...
GROSS: Get a load of those gams.
ROMANO: ...I believe that, you know?
GROSS: Yeah.
ROMANO: I have told this story to other people. And they're like, you would have been fine. Don't worry about it. And then what - a little end to this story is when ""Raymond"" was going off the air - when the last episode was airing, I appeared on ""Letterman"" that night. And so to bring it full circle, I cut my pants into shorts on that episode just 'cause, you know, what I didn't do 10 years ago, I did for the last episode, yeah.
GROSS: Oh, that's funny. Yeah.
ROMANO: Yeah. So that was cool.
GROSS: That's great.
ROMANO: But I believe those kind of things. I'm like, who knows what would have happened, the whole trickle-down effect? Who knows?
GROSS: Yeah.
BIANCULLI: Ray Romano speaking to Terry Gross in 2016 - more after a break. This is FRESH AIR.
(SOUNDBITE OF SONNY ROLLINS AND TOMMY FLANAGAN'S ""H.S."")
BIANCULLI: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to Terry's 2016 interview with comic actor and writer Ray Romano. His first stand-up comedy special in 23 years, ""Ray Romano: Right Here, Around The Corner,"" is now on Netflix.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)
GROSS: So when you started on ""Everybody Loves Raymond,"" the show was - it was kind of billed as like very loosely based on your life - you know, a married man, father of three kids - a daughter and two twin boys and whose parents lived very nearby and who are always kind of showing up and visiting a little too long. And (laughter)...
ROMANO: Yes.
GROSS: ...You know, it's kind of interfering with the married life of this couple.
Did you have a long talk with your family before the show started and say - you know, to say - hey, people are going to be making assumptions about who you really are based on the characters in the sitcom. Some of those assumptions will be true; some of them will be false. Some of the portrayals are going to be more negative than the way I really feel about you. Or you know, like, what kind of (laughter) - what kind of heart-to-heart did you have?
ROMANO: Well, I didn't have a talk before. But I had a couple of talks during (laughter). First of all, let me just say that, you know, I - thank God for Phil Rosenthal, who - you know, they hooked me up with Phil Rosenthal, who wrote the pilot script. And we talked about our families together. And Phil took his parents and my parents and kind of melded them together to become those parents. So it wasn't an exact portrayal of every - down to, you know, the nitty-gritty of my family.
But the only real issue was maybe the brother character 'cause my brother is a New York police officer - or was then at that time. And he actually coined the phrase - I don't know how many people know this. But the title ""Everybody Loves Raymond,"" it's - I mean, I guess most people do, but some still don't. It's said sarcastically in the pilot - in the pilot episode.
And this is a quote from my brother, my real-life brother, who was a police officer. And he would come in and - in real life, he would come over. And he'd see - what? - I got an award, or I got something for stand-up comedy. And he would jokingly, kind of tongue-in-cheek he'd say, well, look at Raymond. Raymond gets awards when he goes to work. You know, when I go to work, people shoot at me.
GROSS: (Laughter).
ROMANO: People spit at me. When Raymond goes, everybody loves Raymond. So I told this story to Phil. And Phil said, oh, that's - we have to use that. We have to use that as the title. And I said, well, please don't. And he said, well, let's just use it as the working title. And then we'll change it when - you know, when it comes time to go to pilot. And of course, Les Moonves, the head of CBS, fell in love with the title. And he would not - I tried desperately to change that title.
GROSS: Why?
ROMANO: Nobody wants (laughter) that. It's just asking for trouble.
GROSS: People taking it at face value, thinking that you think that everybody loves you.
ROMANO: Well, even if they don't take it at face value, to this day - to this day, someone will start an article with, well, not everybody loves Raymond, and this and that.
GROSS: (Laughter).
ROMANO: And yeah, but as far as my family, my brother, who was this tough street cop and a real good cop and really dedicated - and the way Brad Garrett was being portrayed - was portraying him - was slightly goofy. And my mother used to say to me, why - why do they have to make him so goofy? Why did - and I'm - Ma, it's just - it's fictional. It's nothing, you know.
But my brother then became - first of all, he loved what Brad Garrett, the character that he became. And - and we did a couple episodes to show what a good cop he was and what a good soul he was. And my brother was very into that. And he met Brad. And he told Brad that he's proud that he's portraying him.
And not only that, my brother was single at the - at the time, or some point at the time. And he became a little mini - mini celebrity. So I think he was more than happy to be portrayed in this - you know, in any TV show.
GROSS: So what was it like when you started on ""Everybody Loves Raymond""? You're the star of this network sitcom. And I don't think you'd ever really had an acting job before. (Laughter).
ROMANO: No.
GROSS: So everybody's relying on you to be really great in this, and you're, like, not experienced.
ROMANO: No, I had - the one experience I had was getting fired from a sitcom. I got fired from ""NewsRadio."" I don't know if you remember the show ""NewsRadio.""
GROSS: I do remember the show.
ROMANO: Yeah, I was - I was in the original cast. I was - I was hired for the original cast. And on day two of rehearsal for the pilot, I got - I got let go (laughter). Or they went in another direction is what - is what they told us. And I - and I deserved to be fired, I think.
And, you know, I can - I can say now - and even then I kind of knew I was out of my league. I was - I wasn't ready. It just - it didn't feel right. I had a great audition. I - the showrunner saw me, saw my HBO special and asked for me to come in and read. And I had a great audition. He was cracking up. And he just wanted to hire me right there. And he did.
And then I performed for the network. And then at the table read, I could feel I wasn't quite getting it. And then during rehearsal I could feel it also. I was just stiff. I just - I just wasn't ready. And I got let go. I got fired. And then five months later, I want to say, is when I did my ""Letterman"" spot. And the following year is when ""Raymond"" came.
But I was stiff in the beginning of ""Raymond,"" too. They got an acting coach for me. HBO was also one of the producers, along with Worldwide Pants. And somebody from HBO said, listen, we want to hire an acting coach for you. What do you think? And I said, all right, you know. They said, yeah because, you know, it's a little different than stand-up. When you talk, people talk back to you now. I go, oh, yeah, that's - OK, let's see how I can find out how to do that.
BIANCULLI: Ray Romano speaking to Terry Gross in 2016. More after a break. This is FRESH AIR.
(SOUNDBITE OF SCOTT JOPLIN'S ""STOPTIME RAG"")
BIANCULLI: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to Terry's 2016 interview with comic, actor and writer Ray Romano. His current Netflix special, ""Ray Romano: Right Here, Around The Corner,"" is his first stand-up comedy special in 23 years. Here's a taste.
(SOUNDBITE OF COMEDY SPECIAL, ""RAY ROMANO: RIGHT HERE, AROUND THE CORNER"")
ROMANO: You know, the other day, my wife got all of us together, all the men. And she passed a new ordinance in the house, new law. She said, I'm not answering any stupid questions. She goes, from now on, if you ask me a question that you should know the answer, I'm just walking away.
(LAUGHTER)
ROMANO: And I was like, whatever. You know, I don't want to show fear in front of my kids.
(LAUGHTER)
ROMANO: I'm not going to show fear. I have an image for the boys. I didn't think about it. I let her go. And then the next day, I really didn't think about it till I couldn't find my sweatpants. I couldn't find my sweatpants. And I was walking up to ask her, and then I stopped myself. And I go, oh, no, is this one of those?
(LAUGHTER)
ROMANO: And then I thought, I can't live like this.
(LAUGHTER)
ROMANO: And I just - I, look, I said, whatever happens, happens. I said, I can't find my sweatpants. And she looked. And she didn't say anything for a second. And then I got to admit, my heart started beating a little faster.
(LAUGHTER)
ROMANO: And then finally she just goes, check the dryer. They're probably in the dryer. I go, OK. I walked away and went, I got away. I got away. It worked. She scared me. I got away with it. And then I thought, I can't ask her where the dryer is.
(LAUGHTER)
ROMANO: I got to find that dryer. I got to - we got the boys. You know, we all talked about it. Nobody knew. Nobody really knew. We all went in separate directions.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)
GROSS: What was it like for you when you first became famous? It's probably something that you wanted for yourself. But the experience of it might have been very different than what you were expecting.
ROMANO: You know, when you say famous, I guess the first time anyone ever recognized me - I was telling my wife about this the other day that I remember exactly when ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" started. I remember the first person. I was - we had gone back to Queens. It was during a hiatus weekend. I went to a gas station, and I was pumping my gas. And a woman said, hey, aren't you on that show? And I said, yeah, I am. Thank you, you know. And that was it.
And then, you know, it was still a long ways off before I ever had to worry about being somewhere - and not that I have to worry. I mean, nobody is, you know, I'm not Justin Bieber. My fans can't - I can outrun my fans. Put it that way. But yeah. But it's - I want to say strange, but it's not - it doesn't really affect my life too much really. I mean, yes, it does. I - here's what I say. Before I thought my cab driver hated me, and now I think my limo driver hates me.
GROSS: (Laughter).
ROMANO: I think it's all the same, yeah. And this is maybe a negative way to look at it, but I'm just as neurotic if I had never gotten famous or rich. I think I would be equally neurotic because I was neurotic before, and I'm neurotic now. And I'm - I think I'm just as happy as I was then.
GROSS: So a question of ""Men Of A Certain Age,"" in which you played 1 of 3 men dealing with middle age, men who'd been friends since college. And you co-created the show. So a lot of people, when they reach middle age, just try to act like they're not. You know, like, people want to seem like they're young forever, whether that means, like, getting surgery or just dressing a certain way or behaving a certain way.
And so I think it's great that you decided to, you know, write a show about men who are middle aged and really examine in both dramatic and comic way the range of some of those experiences of reaching midlife. And I'd be interested in hearing, like, why you decided to do it and to do something that had, you know, at least as much, if not more, drama in it than comedy.
ROMANO: Well, when ""Raymond"" ended, I was at first very excited - not very excited for it to end, but excited that I was going to, I guess, see what life was like. It was a bit of a cool feeling in the beginning because now you're - all of a sudden, you've got all this time. And you've got this money and this fame now. And - but it was like coming out of a submarine. It was like, what is this now? My kids are teenagers. And I live here. I live in LA.
It was kind of an odd, new feeling. I finally talked with my friend, Mike Royce, who was also a writer on ""Raymond."" And he said he's got the same feeling. And, you know, it's kind of this this weird, where am I, what am I doing now? What's, you know, where's my next passion and purpose? Am I at a part - a time in my life where I accomplished what I wanted to? And we said, let's write about it we.
That's what ""Raymond"" was. ""Raymond"" was writing about what you know. Let's do that. We're not going to do a sitcom, of course. Let's do a single camera and write about it. And that's where ""Men Of A Certain Age"" came out of. And we won a Peabody Award, and then they canceled us. And I have to give credit to TNT because they put us on the air. So I'm not blaming them, but it ultimately didn't find the right home, I don't think. We still miss it. I still miss that show. It was a passion of both of ours.
GROSS: Ray Romano, it's been great to talk with you. Thank you so much.
ROMANO: Well, I appreciate it very much. Thank you, too.

Remembering Oscar-Nominated Character Actor Seymour Cassel,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/12/712673652/remembering-oscar-nominated-character-actor-seymour-cassel?station=KXJZ_FM,"Cassel, who died April 7, performed as a child during matinees of his mom's burlesque shows and went on to appear in movies directed by John Cassavetes and Wes Anderson. Originally broadcast in 2006.
DAVID BIANCULLI, HOST:
This is FRESH AIR. I'm David Bianculli, editor of the website TV Worth Watching, sitting in for Terry Gross. Actor Seymour Cassel, a character actor familiar to fans of the movies of John Cassavetes and Wes Anderson, died last Sunday at age 84. His first screen appearance was a small, uncredited role in the first film Cassavetes ever directed, in ""Shadows,"" in 1958. More than 50 years later, Cassel appeared in an episode of the HBO musical comedy series, ""Flight Of The Conchords,"" and kept working until very recently.
Terry Gross spoke with him in 2006. Overall, Cassel amassed more than 200 acting credits. His later work involved independent films, including Wes Anderson's ""Rushmore"" and ""The Royal Tenenbaums."" In the 1992 film ""In The Soup,"" he starred opposite Steve Buscemi. Buscemi played an aspiring writer with a massively clunky screenplay, and Cassel played the shady character willing to act as the film's finance guy.

TUCCI: (As Gregoire) What?
CASSEL: (As Joe) We just developed a mutual friend, Angelica Peena (ph).
JENNIFER BEALS: (As Angelica Pena) Pena.
CASSEL: (As Joe) Pena - what's the difference?

TUCCI: (As Gregoire) We can work something out.
CASSEL: (As Joe) I'll send someone by. (Laughter) Happy New Year.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)
TERRY GROSS, BYLINE: Seymour Cassel, welcome to FRESH AIR. This was kind of like your - your comeback film. Did you and Buscemi hit it off right away?
CASSEL: Yes, we did. I mean, I started in this business a long time ago. And in New York, I used to follow people down the street and imitate their walks. And so I can do Steve's walk, you know...
GROSS: (Laughter).
CASSEL: And I - and it sometimes drives people crazy, and sometimes they say, that's not the way I walk. And believe me. I'm pretty good at it. But we hit it off well. I didn't really know him or know his work. But Steve, I think I'd seen him in one or two films in some small parts. And it was a great discovery for me. He's an actor that reacts. And by that, I mean he listens, and you see him enjoying you.
GROSS: I assume that Steve Buscemi was a fan of yours before casting you. Did he already know you before meeting you? Did he already know your work...
CASSEL: He knew my work.
GROSS: ...Before meeting you in ""In The Soup.""
CASSEL: He's a big John Cassavetes fan.
GROSS: Yeah, I figured. So before we talk about your work with Cassavetes, I want to talk about your your early - and I mean very early show business career. Although, career is probably not exactly the right word. Your mother was in burlesque on the Minsky circuit when you were...
CASSEL: Yes.
GROSS: ...A child. And it sounds like you toured with her when you were...
CASSEL: I toured with her, yeah.
GROSS: ...When you were very young. What was her act like?
CASSEL: Well, she was a chorus girl. Then she became a specialty act. And if you know burlesque, Minsky had the main theater here. And he had roadshows. And you'd go from New York to Baltimore to D.C., Kansas City, Mo., St. Louis, Chicago, Cleveland, Detroit, Buffalo, Boston. But I got to get on stage when I was about 3 1/2. And I'd do the matinees in a little checkered suit and - with the baggy pants comics. And I could only work a matinee.
And I loved that world - you know, to me, the life on a train and then coming back to New York City and - you know, and had some downtime here. And I wasn't in school yet. And when I had to go to school, I was not very happy about that.
GROSS: So your mother had a specialty act. Does that mean a specialty strip act?
CASSEL: That's right.
GROSS: So what was her specialty?
CASSEL: Oh, she - she tried dancing with the feathers for a while - you know, the big feather fans. And then she tried a balloon once. But it was just natural for me backstage, you know, chorus girls getting dressed, getting undressed. And hi, Seymour, how are you? And hi, Rosie, how are you? You know, you're just - I learned very early that this was my world. And I was going to learn how to live in it.
GROSS: Now, your mother got married when you were young to - and your stepfather won a casino in a crap game. This must have been...
CASSEL: That's not true. He said that.
GROSS: That's not - I keep reading this every place. So what...
CASSEL: Well, it's true...
GROSS: What happened?
CASSEL: ...That's what I was told. I was 9. And I was living in - on 42nd with his mother and sister. He was a master sergeant in the Air Force during World War II, I guess. He'd been in 17 1/2 years. And we lived down in Fort Myers, Fla. We lived in Miami Beach. I remember the end of the war riding in a car with him and him saying, remember this day. A great man died today. And that was Franklin Roosevelt. And then, you know, we lived in Birmingham, Ala. And then the next thing I know, they were going to Panama.
And that's what he told me, that he won it in a crap game. I later figured out, I got a feeling that he did a little business with some guys in Brooklyn and in the Bronx, you know. I mean, where else would - because we lived in a club - we had the whole corner on Ancon in Panama City. Ancon is the first little town in the Canal Zone. And he also had card games for the officers from the Canal Zone. So he was - he was a busy guy. And I'm not sure what he did, but I'm sure some of it was a little illegal. But he made it work.
GROSS: So you were - you were - you were a pretty streetwise kid.
CASSEL: Oh, totally. And I'm still a streetwise guy. I mean, when people start to talk trash with me, I say, you don't know I've been there. Snoop Dogg, I did a movie with him. And he started with me. And he said, where'd you learn that? And I said, well, between 42nd Street and New York, Snoop, I was doing no good and rapping before you ever started.
GROSS: Cassavetes has been such an influence on independent filmmaking. I mean, he's probably one of the most influential filmmakers in the world of independent film. And he was improvising in movies before that became a popular thing to do. What was his approach to getting the actors to improvise a scene? What were you given before the scene, and how would you work it?
CASSEL: Well, John, with ""Shadows"" we would do an improvisation. And John would see where the actors' tendencies and their instincts would take them. Then he would write, you know. But with ""Shadows,"" we would just rehearse it again and again and improvise it again and do it.
Once he started writing and wrote ""Too Late Blues"" and wrote ""Faces,"" you know, there was very - actually, the only improvisation in ""Faces"" is the songs I make up with the girls in - that I pick up at the Whiskey A Go Go, you know, where I say, put on the red meat, mama, don't want no taters, no onions - because we had no money for music. So John knew that I could kind of make up songs. I'd been doing it, you know, in the late '50s.
But when you get to know an actor and, you know, their instincts as well as John knew mine and Gazzara and, you know, and Gena, he could lead you. You can always add something to a scene because your instincts are to embellish it somewhat to contribute to the text. And ideas come to you, and you try them. And if they're good, you keep them. If they're not, you just eliminate them.
GROSS: You had a pretty major part in ""Faces."" You don't come into the film until around two-thirds of the way in. But then it's a pretty important part. ""Faces"" is about - it's basically about a middle-aged, middle-class, very unhappy couple.
So the husband in the couple goes off with Gena Rowlands, who plays a prostitute in it. And his wife goes to the Whiskey A Go Go with her girlfriends. They pick you you up or you pick them up. And you end up going to bed with the wife of this unhappy couple. And she's so miserable by the time, you know, later on about, like, what her life has become that she tries to overdose on sleeping pills.
CASSEL: Yes.
GROSS: And then you try to revive her.
CASSEL: I do revive her.
GROSS: Successfully.
CASSEL: Yes.
GROSS: And then I want to play the scene that happens right after that, after you've stuck your fingers down her throat to revive her...
CASSEL: Yeah.
GROSS: ...And kind of slapped...
CASSEL: To make her throw up, yeah.
GROSS: ...Her awake. You're talking with her, and here's part of that scene.
(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ""FACES"")
CASSEL: (As Chet) I like you. I caused you a lot of pain and a lot of grief, and I almost killed you. And I prayed, man, oh, I prayed to God. God, please, dear God, don't let anything happen to her 'cause I love her so much, and I'll do anything you say, God. And, man, I don't even believe in him, you know? But, I mean, it doesn't matter. We protect ourselves. So when you're taught ethics and values and honesty and I'm a nice guy and you're a nice guy and this and that, you know, I mean, it just doesn't matter. Nobody cares. Nobody has the time to be vulnerable to each other, so we just go on. You know, I mean, right away our armor comes out like a shield and goes around us, and we become like mechanical men. (Laughing) And I called you a mechanical woman. All you got to do is, I'm so mechanical. Honey, it's absolutely ludicrous how mechanical a person can be. (Imitating robot) I am the sexiest guy in the world. (Imitating robot) I have blond hair. (Imitating robot) I can get all the women I want. (Laughing) You're waking up, aren't you?
LYNN CARLIN: (As Maria, laughing) Uh-huh.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)
GROSS: That's Seymour Cassel in a scene from John Cassavetes' movie ""Faces."" Seymour Cassel, tell us a little bit about making that scene.
CASSEL: We were shooting it, and John - as I say to her the dialogue, you know, you think you're mechanical, honey. I'm so mechanical. Look, and I smoke a cigarette mechanically. And John said to me off camera, do the - do a mechanical man. So I did that (imitating robot) you know, kind of a - look at this, honey. And but that's the relationship you have with a director that knows you, that trusts you, that you respect. And you will try anything for him because you know he won't let you look foolish.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)
BIANCULLI: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to Terry's 2006 interview with character actor Seymour Cassel. He first became noticed for his roles in films by John Cassavetes. He died last Sunday at age 84.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)
GROSS: There's so many, like, myths and legends about, you know, the Cassavetes movies and the people who made them and their adventures together making movies and their adventures together off the set. The impression I always get is that there's a lot of, like, partying and drinking that everybody making the movies did together.
CASSEL: Well, in the '50s, that's what people did. Dope wasn't around. Only up in Harlem could you get a nickel - a matchbox of marijuana. But - so we drank, and it was a social - socially accepted. And people drank highballs and cocktails, and every bar had a piano bar with a pianist who sang and, you know, and entertained.
And then there were joints like Jilly's that Sinatra hung out at and made famous. But there was the Five Spot and Basin Street and, you know, Birdland. And then, you know, 52nd street, I mean, you could stand outside at 16 years old and hear Billie Holiday sing because they always had the door open in the summer. And then, you know - all those clubs.
GROSS: Did any of the partying and drinking interfere with the moviemaking?
CASSEL: No. No. If you got too drunk, we - you know, we would wrap. But, I mean, we didn't drink that much when we worked. We would wait till afterward. John had a basketball court built on his house on Woodrow Wilson. And we'd finished shooting the older actors - Marley, you know, and Dorothy Gulliver.
And some would tire maybe around 3:30 in the morning, at 3. And we'd go out there, put the lights on, you know, take a couple of six-packs of beer and play basketball and beat the hell out of each other. It didn't bother anybody because Frank Zappa lived right next door, and he had a recording studio there. So who the hell were we bothering?
GROSS: John Cassavetes died in '89 of cirrhosis of the liver. What impact did that have on you? Were you still close then?
CASSEL: That - it still has an impact on me. I think of him almost every day. I mean, it was the older brother I never had, and it was the closest male friend that I ever had. And he was extremely influential in how - in creating my career and guiding it and - by loving me as much as he does or did. Yeah, that was the closest person in my life ever 'cause I never knew my father. And my mother, I only knew until I was about 12, and I went back to live with my godmother.
So John became a really - very close person in my life. And we were like - he had lost a brother - excuse me - very young before I met him of a heart attack and misdiagnosed and - so to me, it was the older brother I never had. And I don't know what I was to him, but I know that he loved me. And I love him very much. I mean...
GROSS: Now, I understand that you gave up drinking after he died.
CASSEL: I did. Well, I did it just - when I saw how bad he was, I quit. I quit everything. It was 20 something years ago. But...
GROSS: Your comeback wasn't long after that. Were the two connected?
CASSEL: Well, probably - people were less fearful of me because I was crazy. I mean, people would have one foot in Dan Tana's in LA and one foot inside the door and one out. What's Seymour going to do now? I got to see it, but I don't want to be here when he does it. I mean, I...
GROSS: What were you doing? What were you doing...
CASSEL: Anything I wanted. I was - you know, when I would get a little drunk, I would just be funny and stupid. And that's what people do when they - they either get stupid and mean, or they get funny and stupid. I chose to be funny. Mean was not something I liked to be.
GROSS: So you gave up drinking, and...
CASSEL: Yes.
GROSS: ...That's when you started to make your comeback. You said people were afraid to work with you before that.
CASSEL: I was unpredictable.
GROSS: And I think it was largely, like, independent filmmakers that you made your comeback with. You know, your first film was ""In The Soup"" that co-starred Steve Buscemi. Wes Anderson, for example, has cast you in three movies - ""Rushmore""...
CASSEL: ""Rushmore.""
GROSS: ...""The Royal Tenenbaums"" and ""The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou."" How did he first approach you?
CASSEL: He was at Sundance when we won - he had a short called ""Bottle Rocket."" And what impressed me most was his knowledge of film. And I liked the script, and I liked the part. And so after that, he insisted I be in ""The Royal Tenenbaums.""
I didn't want to do ""Life Aquatic."" I was doing another movie. He said, you got to be in this movie. You got to be. And I had to fly to Rome. And then he looks at me, and he said, can we shave your head? I said, Wes, who the hell do you think you are? I'm shooting another movie.
GROSS: (Laughter).
CASSEL: I have already established my hair. He says, well, you could wear a wig. I said, for Christ sake, Wes, you're not the only filmmaker in the world, you know? I'm - why don't I wear a wig here? He said, well, no, the character has to be bald. I said, then do the skullcap. And that was miserable. It's 2 1/2 to 3 hours to put that on.
GROSS: Your new movie ""Lonesome Jim"" - you play the father in a nuclear family - husband, wife, two sons. And I'm thinking that must be very exotic to you, in a way, because you never really had that kind of nuclear family. Well, I guess maybe you had it as an adult, but you certainly didn't have it as a boy. Does the idea of, like, a real nuclear family seem somewhat exotic to you?
CASSEL: Well, it - I thought being as crazy as I was and knowing that very early - I was my own source of entertainment. When I had my own family - and I still do it with my grandchildren - I created the craziness that my kids grew up around in LA - The Rolling Stones, you know, and Jimi Hendrix and Cassavetes and all this. And their father was a bit crazy, but he loved them very much because it was what I never had. And I was grateful to have it.
Playing a straight family and a guy like that - people suppress themselves, and they get comfortable with a specific way of life. And they don't take chances anymore. And I've - I just knew from 3, 4, 5, 6 years old that life is a chance, and everything you do in it is. And, you know, I wasn't going to climb up the side of a tenement until I was sure I could make it.
You know, and then we'd go up that brick that sticks out on the edge of a - on 42nd Street - on those buildings. We'd go up to the roof. There were only about three of us that could do that when I was, you know, 8. And a new kid would move in, and we'd, you know, say, hey, can you climb? Yes. Come on. Try - he'd get stuck a floor and a half up, and we got to call the firetrucks to come and rescue him, you know? But, I mean, that's - that was kids here. So I was always an adventurer, you know?
And to play this character that I played in ""Lonesome Jim"" - to play Don - I met the guy, and I met his wife. And to play someone like that - it was tough for me to be that quiet, you know? And I understood who he was. And it's just the safe way, and I've never done anything safe.
GROSS: Well, Seymour Cassel, thank you so much.
CASSEL: Thank you.

'Game Of Thrones' Keeps Its Finger On The Pulse As It Enters The Home Stretch,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/11/712274776/game-of-thrones-keeps-its-finger-on-the-pulse-as-it-enters-the-home-stretch?station=KXJZ_FM,"Over the years, the HBO series has risen from being a nifty potboiler to a timely expression of a zeitgeist that contests everything from gender roles to climate change to immigration.
TERRY GROSS, HOST:
This is FRESH AIR. As everyone has surely heard by now, on Sunday night, HBO will begin airing the final season of ""Game Of Thrones"" - a show with a huge and fanatical international fan base. Although HBO hasn't made any episodes available for screening, our critic at large, John Powers, couldn't resist talking about why it's a show that defines our era.
JOHN POWERS, BYLINE: When ""Game Of Thrones"" premiered eight years ago this month, I was skeptical. I mean, who wanted to see a ""Dungeon & Dragons"" epic loosely based on the 15th century War of the Roses? Then I watched the first episode, which built to the most shocking ending I'd ever seen on TV. A knight who's been caught making love to his own sister pushes a 10-year-old boy from a hundred-foot tower. That got my attention, and obviously not just mine.
As it starts down the homestretch on Sunday, this HBO franchise has become the world's most popular show. Some journalists are even writing elegiac articles about how, given our fragmented media environment, ""Game Of Thrones"" may be the last TV series that everyone watches at the same time in order to be part of the conversation.
It's easy to understand its popularity. Set on the imaginary continent of Westeros, invented by novelist George R. R. Martin, ""Game Of Thrones"" tells a juicy story of heroic knights, canny eunuchs, religious fanatics, psychopathic kings, fire-breathing dragons, savage wars, strong women, naked women and men whose castration anxiety is caused by actual castration.
All this lurid stuff is deftly orchestrated by series creators David Benioff and D.B. Weiss, who give us a changing world of changing characters. For instance, Nikolaj Coster-Waldau's handsome, villainous Jaime Lannister - he's the one who pushes the little boy off the tower - gradually develops a complicated moral sense.
Over the years, ""Game Of Thrones"" has risen from being a nifty potboiler to a timely expression of a zeitgeist that contests everything from gender to climate change to immigration. Heck, Westeros even has a big wall to keep out aliens. It's become so much of our cultural lingua franca that when liberals compare Donald Trump to King Joffrey or conservatives compare Hillary Clinton to Cersei Lannister, they assume you know what they mean.
Of course, like any truly great piece of pop entertainment, the show doesn't make an obvious political statement. It is a stew of energizing contradictions. In fact, it sometimes feels like a strange collaboration between Dick Cheney and Rachel Maddow. The world it depicts is Cheneyesque (ph) in its doom-laden vision of life as a dog-eat-dog struggle for power. Without power, the show suggests, you are nothing, and your ideals are pointless. Without strong authority, there is chaos.
At the same time, the series is shot through with a jaunty Maddowesque (ph) liberalism, a belief that not only is compassion possible, but that the most compassionate people are apt to be outsiders - the debauched but honorable dwarf Tyrion Lannister, played by Peter Dinklage, who gets the show's best lines; Kit Harrington's bastard Jon Snow, who is literally resurrected to help save the world; and Emilia Clarke's Daenerys Targaryen, who, after being forced to marry a hunky barbarian, mothers three dragons and becomes the slave-freeing Khaleesi who offers potential followers a rather steely vision of freedom, as we can hear in this speech from last season.
(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, ""GAME OF THRONES"")
EMILIA CLARKE: (As Daenerys Targaryen) I'm not here to murder, and all I want to destroy is the wheel that has rolled over rich and poor to the benefit of no one but the Cersei Lannisters of the world. I offer you a choice. Bend the knee and join me. Together, we will leave the world a better place than we found it. Or refuse and die.
POWERS: From the show's beginnings, we've heard dark mutterings that winter is coming - the show's obvious analogue to climate change - and with it, the arrival of the White Walkers, humanoid ice creatures that will slaughter everyone in their path. And season after season, we've watched this existential threat be ignored by leaders and would-be leaders, sunk in their smaller obsessions with revenge, family, sadistic pleasure and, of course, personal power.
In the upcoming episodes, the main characters will face the consequences of such carelessness, and ""Game Of Thrones'"" true vision will finally reveal itself. Will Westeros be saved by the alliance between Jon Snow and the mother of dragons? Will Cersei truly join with others to fight the army of death, or will she still be scheming? And, if the latter, who will finally kill her?
The smart money is on her brother and lover, Jaime. I'm not kidding. There are already gambling pools on who will live and who won't. That's because the series' great narrative strength has always been its ruthlessness. With most shows, you know who's safe. Don Draper isn't going to die in Season 2 of ""Mad Men."" But here, you don't.
Major characters have been killed off every season, and we know that some of our favorites will die this time out. In fact, what makes the show special is that, given the Hobbesian reality of Westeros, we can't be completely sure they won't all die. Naturally, I don't hope that this will happen, but I do find it exciting that, for once, it just might.
GROSS: John Powers is our critic-at-large. We want to congratulate our classical music critic, Lloyd Schwartz, who is also a poet, and just received a Guggenheim Fellowship in poetry.

Isabella Vosmikova/HBO ""I knew that I wanted to act since I was old enough to reason,"" says Henry Winkler. ""I never had a Plan B. I never deviated. I never thought that there was anything else that I could possibly do in this world except to try and be a working actor.""
After Winkler graduated with an M.F.A. from the Yale School of Drama in 1970, one of his earliest roles was as the cool, leather-jacket-wearing Fonz on the classic sitcom Happy Days, which ran from 1974 until 1984.
It was an iconic role — but the typecasting was tough to shake: ""It took me maybe eight years after the Fonz to really get a good acting role,"" Winkler says.
Pop Culture Happy Hour A Contract Killer Walks Into An Acting Class, On HBO's 'Barry' Arts & Life Bill Hader On Sketch Comedy, His Love Of Old Films Eventually, Winkler was able to move on. He appeared for decades in movies and TV shows, including recurring comic roles in Parks and Recreation and Arrested Development. In 2018, he won a best supporting actor Emmy for his role on the HBO series Barry.
On Barry, Winkler plays a self-important acting teacher to a hitman played by Bill Hader. Winkler draws on his own experiences — both as an actor and a teacher — for the role.
""A lot of acting teachers, they talk about breaking bad habits, they talk about breaking you down, and I totally get that,"" he says. ""But I've taught four classes in my life and I think you can get an actor to move off their position without making them feel like poop from a whale at the bottom of the ocean.""
Interview Highlights On doing commercials early in his career
Sanka coffee, which was a decaffeinated coffee. American Airlines. H&R Block taxes. Gleem toothpaste, which is the whitening toothpaste. At the time, I had really nice teeth. Like that, and on and on, I got great at getting commercials and I didn't have to do another job to make ends meet. I made my living and I could do plays for free at the Manhattan Theatre Club at night. ...
Everybody I went to Yale with said, ""I don't know how you can do commercials; we are trained for theater."" Except that the money I made from commercials allowed me to go to California for a month and be able to survive, and within two weeks I got Happy Days .
On learning he had dyslexia at age 31
[I found out] after my stepson was tested, because he was so verbal, and he is so smart, but he couldn't do reports. He couldn't write. He couldn't organize his thoughts. And when we had him tested, everything that they said about Jed was true about me, and I realized ... ""I actually have something with a name."" ...
Author Interviews Dyslexia Made Henry Winkler Feel 'Stupid' For Years. Now, He's A Best-Selling Author The first thing, I got very angry, because all of the arguments in my house with the short Germans — who were my parents — were for naught. All of the grounding was for naught. Like, I couldn't go to the dance on Friday night because ... my grades were horrible. ... I now understand, possibly, if I didn't fight through my dyslexia I would not be sitting at this microphone chatting with you. ...
The reading is still difficult for me. When we did Happy Days, I embarrassed myself for 10 years reading around that table with the producers, the other actors, the director, all of the department heads. On Monday morning, we read the scripts. I stumbled over every word. I was completely embarrassed.
On his dyslexia now
We're sitting around the table and sometimes people who sit next to me have to point out that I have dropped a line, that I just missed it on the page, and I'm sitting there thinking, ""Oh my God! I wonder whose line it is?"" There's a big silence here. It turns out it's me! I'm still embarrassed. And not only that, but also I want to be perfect, and I hate when I miss the timing, or I screw another actor's timing up because I have screwed the line up so badly, or I have to go back again. Ugh, I hate it. Sometimes I just — I hate my brain.
On his family leaving Germany during World War II
My father knew that it was time. He got a six-week visa from Germany to come and do work in New York but was expected to come right back. ... He took his mother's jewelry, bought a box of chocolate, melted the chocolate down, put the pieces of jewelry in the chocolate box, poured the chocolate over the jewelry [and] put the box under his arm. So when he was stopped by the Nazis, and they said, ""Are you taking anything of value out of Germany? Now you can open every bag?"" — we've got nothing.
The jewelry that he encased in chocolate he sold when he came out of Ellis Island into New York, and was able to start a new life here, slowly but surely. I have the actual letters from the government each time my father requested to stay a little longer, and they would say yes. And I was born, and thank God, because I love our country.

Lauren A. Terrazas/Texas Public Radio World-renowned cellist Yo-Yo Ma brought his Bach Project to the sister cities of Laredo, Texas, and Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, on Saturday. The ""Day of Action"" featured performances in both cities to celebrate the relationship between the two communities.
Ma played the opening notes of Johann Sebastian Bach's Suite No. 1 for Unaccompanied Cello in a park next to the Juarez-Lincoln International Bridge, one of the crossings that connect the U.S. and Mexican cities.
The Laredo performance took place on an elevated stage before an audience of officials and onlookers. Concerns over possible rain disappeared as Ma began to play in the morning sunshine.
Texas Public Radio via YouTube It was part of his Bach Project, which uses the composer's 300-year-old music to explore connections between cultures. The project has taken Ma all over the world. On Friday it brought him to Laurie Auditorium at Trinity University in San Antonio, and on Saturday it brought him to Laredo, within a few feet of the Rio Grande.
""As you all know, as you did and do and will do, in culture, we build bridges, not walls,"" he said. After his performance, he gestured to the bridge to his right. ""I've lived my life at the borders. Between cultures. Between disciplines. Between musics. Between generations.""
Mateo Bailey, 16, lives in San Antonio. He grew up in El Paso, plays the cello and is the son of Grammy Award-winning cellist Zuill Bailey.
He felt Ma's performance had special significance ""because this event is on the border. And I'm half-Mexican as well as half-American ... and for him to connect cello with what's happening in the world is like, it's a cultural bridge that was just built, and it's amazing.""
Betty DeLeon praised the cellist for visiting. ""It speaks of him. What a wonderful human being to take his time and come to our tiny little town to share the importance of culture. On the border. It's amazing. It's a privilege to be a part of this.""
Pete Saenz, mayor of Laredo, said that despite the river and despite the bridge spanning overhead, the border is one community.
""And although people may perceive us as being so different, we're not,"" he said. ""Here the border is extremely unique in that it's one organism. I've always said we're interdependent, interconnected. We survived because the border side survives, especially here on the border area.""
Tiny Desk Yo-Yo Ma: Tiny Desk Concert This Day of Action also included a performance in Plaza Juarez in Nuevo Laredo, a few blocks from the international crossing. Its overall theme was an appreciation for the connections between the two cities, which see themselves as one community.
Ma was originally scheduled to play on the actual bridge, which would have been briefly closed. The planned closure would have been a collaborative effort between officials and residents on both sides of the border. But the traffic and pedestrian delays that the performance would have caused convinced officials to move the locale to the Tres Laredos Park right next to the bridge.
The famous cellist has studied and performed the German composer's music for six decades.
In 2018, Ma set out on a two-year journey to perform Bach's six suites for solo cello in 36 locations around the world. He believes the music has an ability to connect cultures and humanity from all walks of life. He said that this is what motivated him to launch the project."
"Viral Stars, The 'Syncopated Ladies,' Shake Up Tap Dancing",www.npr.org,npr.org,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/13/713097764/viral-stars-the-syncopated-ladies-shake-up-tap-dancing,"NPR's Michel Martin speaks with tap dancer Chloe Arnold, of the Syncopated Ladies, about their viral dance videos and annual tap festival.
MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:
Finally today, let's talk about tap dance. And we're not talking about politicians trying to get out of answering hard questions. And we're not even talking about another image you might have of old guys in tuxedos from the 1940s. No, we're talking about the Syncopated Ladies, an all-female tap squad that has become an Internet sensation for their tight moves set to popular music, think Prince and Beyonce.
(SOUNDBITE OF SYNCOPATED LADIES PERFORMANCE)
MARTIN: You might have caught them on the TV show ""So You Think You Can Dance"" or featured on Beyonce's home page. Two sisters, Maud and Chloe Arnold, founded the group. They're here in Washington, D.C., this weekend for their annual concert and showcase. So we thought this was a good time to hear more about the group and how they're changing the look of tap.
And Chloe Arnold is with us now to represent both sisters. And she's with us now. Welcome. Thank you so much for joining us.
CHLOE ARNOLD: Thank you Michel. I'm so, so happy to be here. And I'm really excited to talk about tap dancing.
MARTIN: And thanks for taking time out of a really busy schedule of master classes and all the things that you're doing. As I mentioned, this is your hometown. How did you get started in tap dancing? Was it, like, the usual you had too much energy, so mom put you in a class?
ARNOLD: Well, my mom did dance for fun when she was growing up. And so it was something that she wanted to just share with her kids. And then she saw that we were really loving it. And so she started to seek out more opportunities.
MARTIN: What is it that you think you love about tap?
ARNOLD: I think that, for me, when you're tap dancing, you are a musician and a dancer. And what I love about tap is you can, you know, it's percussive, so you can do it to any kind of music. And I have a broad taste of music. So it allows me to lock into any pocket and to really express myself.
And there's an element of improvisation within tap that fits my personality well because I love to improvise and freestyle and make things up in the moment.
MARTIN: And I noticed that after college, you formed a dance company with your sister, Maud. And I wondered what made you think this could be a career because, you know, frankly, tap isn't something that - well, when you were kind of developing the form, it isn't something that you saw a lot of except on - say, on period pieces, on Broadway...
ARNOLD: Correct.
MARTIN: ...You know like - you know, or, you know, or The Rockettes, which is just, you know, not everybody's cup of tea. So what made you think that you could kind of take this someplace?
ARNOLD: So when we were growing up here in D.C., an incredible woman, Debbie Allen, came and we got to be in a play of hers at the Kennedy Center. And so that was my first initial thing of seeing a black woman of excellence be able to shape her own way. And it gave me the confidence that I could do the same.
And so then I actually went to Columbia University. And I studied film. And I thought to myself you know how I'm going to do this? I'm going to put tap dance in TV, music videos and film. And so the way that Syncopated Ladies started to make our imprint was to show people the way that I imagined our art, meaning full of black girl magic, full of rhythm, syncopation, body, curves. We say fierce footwork with a female force.
And so when we're creating, you know, what I was seeing when I was in college in New York was there were just not really any roles for African-American women in tap dance. If you were going to be on Broadway, it's all chorus girls, which means a line of women, and you really have to - at that time - fit into that line, right? And my body type with curves and - there's just not a lot of black women, and they're definitely not curvy women.
MARTIN: There's just so many - a couple things I wanted to dig into. Like, first of all, one of the things that I saw at your shows is exactly the point that you just made. One of the things that really struck me is there was every kind of person in it. There was young people. There were kids. There were older. They were every race. And they were all different kinds of body types...
ARNOLD: Yes.
MARTIN: ...And one of the biggest applauses went to a larger-sized woman - frankly, not the type of body type that I think most people associate with professional dance. And it was just, you know, it was just kind of eye opening. And I was wondering how your philosophy around this came about, that not just that anybody could take your classes, but that people with all these different body types can perform?
ARNOLD: Yes, the woman that you're speaking of, she was our student from when she was 10-years-old. And when she came first to us, she did have self-doubt and was under the lens and microscope of not fitting in. And we literally have worked with her over the past 10 years to get her to a place where she can walk on that stage in that bright yellow shirt shining whereas before as a kid, she would been hiding. And so it takes time. And it takes effort. And it takes, like, a vision that you see - again, the deeper excellence in a human. And that is the part that makes artists amazing. It's not being cookie cutter.
MARTIN: Well, also, your work is being recognized. I mean, you earned an Emmy nomination for your work on ""The Late Late Show With James Corden."" Congratulations for that.
ARNOLD: Thank you. Thank you so much.
MARTIN: But I also - tell us about the episode that you choreographed. It just sounds crazy.
ARNOLD: Oh, my God. So first of all, I love James Corden. I love ""The Late Late Show"" because it is literally unlimited adventure. You know, this particular one is called Crosswalk Musical. And this one was with Hugh Jackman, Zendaya and Zac Efron and James Corden in the crosswalk on Broadway in New York City with a cast of 16 dancers. And we put on basically 40 second musicals in the crosswalk.
(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, ""THE LATE LATE SHOW WITH JAMES CORDEN"")
UNIDENTIFIED SINGERS: (Singing) The people ride in a hole in the ground. New York, New York, it's a hell of a town. Cars, cars, cars. Wow. Wow.
ARNOLD: And it is absolutely hysterical. And people ask me all the time, is that real? And it is totally real. We are literally in the street during the time that the light is red. We put on a musical. And when they are running, they are running because the light is going to change.
MARTIN: That is crazy. That sounded crazy.
ARNOLD: It is absolutely nuts. And it's so fun. And it's really been great for dance and for art to just again, expand the creativity and create more opportunity.
MARTIN: Well, you certainly are expanding, I think, people's vision of what tap can be. Finally, before I let you go, what do you think it is that we still like about tap? As I said that for people whose only vision of it is like, you know, The Rockettes - no disrespect to The Rockettes - you know, or the Hines brothers back in the day, I mean, Savion Glover, of course. So I mean, maybe people will have seen him. But what is it that you think we still like about it because one of the things, again, that was fascinating about your showcase is that all kinds of people were there. There was every kind of person there - all ages, all races, all, you know, what is it that you think we still like about it?
ARNOLD: Well, artistically speaking, you know, percussion is mesmerizing. I mean, the drum is the essence, honestly, of the heartbeat. It is from - it is the origin - original African expression and music. So the drum and that idea that our feet are, you know, we are the drum in our physicality our oral and visual presentation. And I think that that is just honestly an innate human connection that people have.
So I think that rhythm is what draws everyone together. And I think, though, then the part that keeps you is style because then the style is reflective of the individual person's journey and experience and culture and where they come from. And then that, again, captivates different people based around their own life experience.
MARTIN: That is the Emmy nominated choreographer and dancer Chloe Arnold. She's the co-founder with her sister of Syncopated Ladies. And she's teaching and performing this weekend in Washington, D.C., at the D.C. Tap Festival. And Chloe Arnold, thank you so much for talking with us.
ARNOLD: Thank you for having me. I love NPR. And I really, really appreciate being here.

NPR's Michel Martin speaks with Abderrahim Foukara, Al Jazeera's Washington, D.C. bureau chief, about the recent regime changes in Algeria and Sudan.
MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:
Over the course of just two weeks, two longtime autocratic rulers have been driven from power - Omar al-Bashir in Sudan and Abdelaziz Bouteflika in Algeria. In both cases, the question now is, what comes next? And will these countries see full regime change or just more of the same? We wanted to take up that question with Abderrahim Foukara. He's the Washington, D.C., bureau chief of Al Jazeera, and he's with us in our studios now in Washington, D.C., to help us understand the regional picture.
Abderrahim, thanks so much for joining us.
ABDERRAHIM FOUKARA: Thank you, Michel.
MARTIN: So how do you understand what's happening in the region right now?
FOUKARA: Well, I understand it as a continuation of what started happening way back in 2011. A lot of governments in the region thought that at some point after 2011, things started to go back to normal. But obviously, many of the reasons why we had the 2011 uprisings in the first place have not been solved. And obviously, everyone in the region, whether they are peoples or governments - they're watching to see where the region goes to from here in light of what's happening in Sudan and Algeria.
MARTIN: And what do you think message the demonstrators are drawing from the events of 2011 - and also, what message you think the governing bodies are drawing from the events of 2011? Because, for example, in Sudan, the defense minister has said that a military council will rule for the next two years before any democratic elections are held. You know, it's hard to see that the protesters will find that acceptable. So I'm just wondering what you see. Like, what are both sides drawing from the sort of recent past about what the path forward should be?
FOUKARA: The protesters in Sudan - they say they've learned a lot from what happened way back in 2011. They've learned not to trust the military. They've learned to say that the military's role is basically to secure the border and to maintain stability - not to run the people's affairs. To what extent will the military in Sudan and the militaries throughout the region actually watching what's happening in Sudan will be convinced by that remains to be seen.
MARTIN: Could you talk a little bit more about what the roots of this are? Because I think many people with even a cursory understanding of the region will know that these leaders have been in power for many, many years, that economic stagnation has been the rule, not the exception. So what are the sparks? Like, what is it that finally caused people to say, enough?
FOUKARA: Well, I mean, in the case of Sudan, the Sudanese, they've had two revolutions. They had one in the '60s, and they had one in the '80s. And in each one of those, obviously, the developments yielded a civilian government, but then the military took over. The protesters - they tried to avoid that same fate for a third time. Life is hard in Sudan, as it is in many other parts of the Middle East and Africa. Prices are high. Bread is not always easy to come by. Salaries are very low. There's a lot of unemployment. There's a youth bulge. Not many jobs are available. And add to that the issue of freedoms. A lot of people are in jail. A lot of people have been in jail in Sudan and other parts of the region.
This spark, obviously, this time round was bread, higher - high bread prices. You know, the government was squeezed for funds - although its critics are saying there's a lot of corruption, that there's a lot of money that's been embezzled and stolen. But here we are. Now Bashir is gone. A military council has taken its place, and the Sudanese are trying to fumble the next step into their future.
MARTIN: And what about in Algeria? What about with Bouteflika? I mean, he's been suffering health problems. He hasn't been visible. What is the spark there?
FOUKARA: There are similar reasons in terms of the hardships of daily life. And in the case of Algeria, the spark was that the former president, Abdelaziz Bouteflika, who to all intents and purposes - I mean, when you see him in - on TV, he's in a wheelchair. He doesn't always seem to be conscious. And yet, it was announced that he was going to run for a fifth term. Algerians took to the street to say no. We cannot have that. He must be just a puppet. There are other players behind him trying to manipulate the situation for their own advantage. That's how it started.
MARTIN: In each of these cases, in Sudan and in Algeria, is there a sort of an opposition figure like we've seen in Venezuela, for example, where Juan Guaido has sort of - has become recognized as the face of the opposition - like, the preferred leader? Is that the case in either of these places?
FOUKARA: That has been a unique characteristic of all these revolutions throughout North Africa and the Middle East since 2011. They have not actually produced a particular figurehead, so to speak, to lead them. And maybe that was done by design because the people who have risen against their governments - they don't always trust the conventional opposition, and they often feel that it's in cahoots with the regime that they're trying to topple.
But we have seen the downside of that in terms of these protesters needing somebody to rally around and, you know, make their word heard much more forcefully than it would have been otherwise. In the specific case of Sudan, that's also - definitely that has been the case of a lot of protests, a lot of protesters, but so far, we haven't seen one person who can take all these events and galvanize them to actually help push for change. And the opinion is different whether that's a good thing or or a bad thing. It depends who from the protesters you talk to.
MARTIN: And so, finally, what is the U.S. role in all this? Or how has the U.S. responded? I mean, in recent years, you know, obviously, Sudan has been an international pariah because of its treatment of the - because of its conduct in Darfur, the military's conduct in Darfur. But the U.S. has been cooperating with Sudan on intelligence in recent years. So what's the U.S. role now? Or how is the U.S. responding?
FOUKARA: Well, the stakes for the U.S. in all these places are very high. They are higher in Sudan than they are in Algeria, for example. Algeria is much more tied to France and so on. In the case of Sudan, there's the issue of Darfur. There's the issue of relations between North Sudan and the young South Sudan. And, you know, the U.S. was very supportive of the independence of South Sudan.
But there's also the issue of terrorism, and the U.S. is very invested in that. Sudan was under sanctions, but the U.S. did get to a point where it was working with Bashir very closely in combating terrorism. So it's obviously a very complex situation. Sudan is a central country to different regional groupings and central to a lot of issues that are of interest to various players, including the United States.
MARTIN: That's Abderrahim Foukara. He is the bureau chief of news for Al Jazeera in Washington, D.C., and he was kind of to join us in our studios in Washington, D.C.
Abderrahim, thanks so much for talking to us once again.

The Influence Of American Jewish Attitudes On Israeli Politics,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/13/713097748/the-influence-of-american-jewish-attitudes-on-israeli-politics,"The Influence Of American Jewish Attitudes On Israeli Politics The Influence Of American Jewish Attitudes On Israeli Politics Embed Embed
Following the re-election of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, NPR's Michel Martin speaks with Nadine Epstein, editor-in-chief of Moment Magazine, about the American Jewish community's impact on Israeli politics.
MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:
In Israel this week, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu won re-election for his fourth consecutive term, his fifth term overall. And as the campaign unfolded, we heard about Netanyahu's imprint on Israeli politics over the years. But we found ourselves interested in what may have an influence on him. Specifically, we were wondering if the American Jewish community remains an important factor in his point of view.
For that perspective, we're joined in our studios by Nadine Epstein. She's editor-in-chief and CEO of Moment Magazine. It's a magazine that was co-founded in 1975 by the late Nobel Peace Prize human rights activist and Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel. And Nadine Epstein is here with us in our studios now. Welcome. Thank you so much for joining us.
NADINE EPSTEIN: Thank you.
MARTIN: Could you just describe historically what the relationship has been, say, in recent years over the last, say, 15 or 20 years between the American Jewish community and Israeli politics overall? I mean, did Americans - see themselves as influential, were they influential?
EPSTEIN: I think American Jews saw themselves as very influential on Israel, and they were part of the building of the whole Zionist enterprise for decades. And this changed dramatically really over the last 10 years in part after Benjamin Netanyahu was elected again for his second term in 2007. He had been prime minister also for three years in the 1990s. And what happened in Israel was a new kind of - more religious messianic Zionism began to take root which was much more supportive of settlements. And it was a different kind of Zionism than I think most American Jews are comfortable with.
MARTIN: It's my understanding that the majority of American Jews lean Democratic, and yet we see that President Trump has made an aggressive effort to reach out to conservative Jewish people. He's also made an effort to reach out to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and Benjamin Netanyahu has reached back to him. How is that being perceived in the American Jewish community? How is that understood?
EPSTEIN: It depends on where you are in the Jewish - American Jewish community. And you'll see that the 25 percent of Jews who are on the right are now embracing the Netanyahu government. And then you'll see the 75 percent of people voting Democrat are very uncomfortable not with Israel but with the policies of the Netanyahu government.
And that's very important to make that distinction because I think the vast majority of Americans are all very supportive of Israel. And certainly the vast majority of American Jews care deeply about Israel. But what has happened as the bigger picture has changed, you see more and more American Jews in the middle, feeling disaffected, feeling less connected with Israel. That's something very concerning in the American Jewish community.
MARTIN: Now that Donald Trump's aides have leaked that the president is expected to release a peace plan once the prime minister forms a coalition government, as he is expected to do, how do you see that playing out among the American Jewish community?
EPSTEIN: Well, first of all, the new concern is that right before the election, that Netanyahu brought up annexation. And that has sent shivers through much of the American Jewish community. You see a number of high-ranking members of Congress who are actually normally very close to AIPAC speaking out against annexation. You see center-establishment organizations very concerned and publicly speaking out against annexation. So annexation is sort of like the new fear among, I think, many in the Jewish community. And again, I'm speaking for the middle, not so much for the right or for the left here.
MARTIN: So do people feel less connected to Israel than they had been in the past? I mean, do they feel less welcome there?
EPSTEIN: I wouldn't say that they feel less welcome there, but there's definitely been a long process now of disaffection. And I actually just interviewed Ehud Barak, former prime minister of Israel. I spoke to him before the election, and he was voicing what I hear all the time from Israeli leaders and Israelis, that young American Jews no longer feel the same kind of connection that young Jews and different generations felt towards Israel. And studies show that that is true. But there's another element that
I think many people like Barak and also other Israelis are missing and that there are many middle-aged and elderly American Jews who are also feeling disaffected and who have just had to step back because this has been going on so long. And they're so disappointed. And they just don't feel that connection to Israel that they once did. And in the long term, the American Jewish community doesn't want any of that. In the long term, Israel doesn't want that. There is a really important connection between the American Jewish community and Israel. And it's a very important one for Israel. And it's a very important one for American Jews. We don't want to lose that.
MARTIN: That's Nadine Epstein, editor-in-chief and CEO of Moment Magazine. She's also the author of the new book ""Elie Wiesel, An Extraordinary Life And Legacy."" She was kind of to join us our studios in Washington, D.C. Nadine Epstein, thank you so much for joining us.

Nephew Of Robert E.

Lee Grapples With Legacy Of American Race Relations In New Book Nephew Of Robert E. Lee Grapples With Legacy Of American Race Relations In New Book Embed Embed
Robert W. Lee tells NPR's Michel Martin what it's like to grapple with the legacy of his ancestor, Confederate General Robert E. Lee. He wrote about this in a memoir, ""A Sin by Any Other Name.""
MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:
In the South, the name Robert E. Lee is everywhere. Schools, parks, streets, entire counties bear the name of the leader of the Confederate Army during the Civil War. More recently, statues in his honor have been at the center of heated debates including in Charlottesville, Va., where the statue was the purported emphasis for the white supremacist rally there in 2017.
My next guest is also a Robert Lee - the Reverend Robert W. Lee. He is the nephew of the famous general many generations removed and grew up with reverence for him. He still has that reverence, but he's also grappling with the meaning of his legacy. And he's urging others, specifically others who share that heritage, to do the same.
He offers his thoughts about all this in a new book, ""A Sin By Any Other Name: Reckoning With Racism And The Heritage Of The South."" And he's with us now from WFAE in Charlotte, N.C. Reverend Lee, welcome. Thank you so much for talking to us.
ROBERT W LEE: Thank you for having me.
MARTIN: So you talk in the book about the first time that you learned you were related to Robert E. Lee from a picture hanging in your grandmother's house. Do you remember, you know, what that felt like when you heard about this, when you learned this?
LEE: I think in the South, there is a certain reverence, as you said, and a certain awe for the man named Robert E. Lee. Regardless of what you think of him and what he did, he is a staple of Southern culture. And so when I found out that I was related to him, and a close relation at that, it was as if my world had been shaken in the best way possible. It's like told - being told you're related to a celebrity down here.
MARTIN: One of the things about your book that I like is that, you know, what we often as journalists report on history as these big cataclysmic moments, right? But you describe, like, a series of smaller, quieter moments that influenced your thinking. Could you just talk a little bit about how your image of him first became complicated or more nuanced?
LEE: I grew up under the care of a nurse named Janie Bowman (ph) who really cared for me. She was a woman of color. She was someone who was 60, 70 years my senior at the time that I met her. And she would cook me sausage. She would take me for a walk. She would read the Psalms to me.
But she also understood that down here in the south, even in the 1990s when I was a kid, Jim Crow still lived. And so she wouldn't eat after me. She wouldn't use the same utensils or the same glasses that we had at my house because it was Robert Lee's house. You don't do that. That was just her understanding of the Jim Crow South at the time. And I've struggled with that ever since, this reality that I bear a name that has caused such pain not only for people that I love, but for this nation as well.
MARTIN: But you still went to an all-white Christian academy - right? - one of those seg academies that was set up specifically to avoid the court-ordered desegregation of the public school system there, right? Did you ever ask about that? Did you ever wonder, like, why?
LEE: To this day, I still wonder why. And it was an all right school. They were nice to me. But we had lunch catered from outside venues - from fast food joints or from the local Japanese restaurant while our friends over at Statesville Middle School were eating lunches that probably shouldn't have been eaten by anyone.
So this was a dichotomy and a juxtaposition that I still live with to this day. And I hope and pray that this book will give us a chance to reconcile those realities.
MARTIN: In the book, the events in Charlottesville in 2017 were a turning point for you. That's when the - of course, I think most people will remember that these white nationalists were marching through the city. And it purportedly started as a protest against the removal of a statue of Robert E. Lee. And then of course, the activist young woman Heather Heyer was killed. A number of people were injured.
The fact that reverence for Robert E. Lee allegedly was at the center of that chaos and violence, was that something that was transformative for you?
LEE: It broke my heart. I've had the opportunity to befriend Susan Bro, the mother of Heather Heyer who was killed in Charlottesville. And when my book came out, she said, stay strong. Keep the faith and keep fighting. And that gave me a lot of hope because if she can reconcile with herself the fact that my ancestor's statue caused this problem, then we can work together still. We can still confront racism as we do together with her foundation, the Heather Heyer Foundation. We can do this.
MARTIN: I'm wondering if - I don't think you have kids yet, you and your wife. But if you should have a son, what are you thinking about - Emmett? I don't know. What - Bill? Is Robert still on the table?
LEE: Well, I can tell you - and my wife - first of all, for all of you who are worried, my wife gave me permission to say this - we are not going to name our child Robert Lee if we have a boy. We are going to end it here because for us, the weight of this name is growing as people seek to create a racist reality. People are venerating this name instead of living into it as a sinful past.
So my wife and I have thought about Elliott, which is the middle name of my mentor who preached my ordination service. We've thought about a few different names. But those are some that come to mind. And we just want to have a future filled with hope, not one filled with a past that is deeply broken.
MARTIN: Well, good luck. Keep us posted on all of those developments if you don't mind. All right.
LEE: Yes, ma'am. Thank you.
MARTIN: The Reverend Robert W. Lee. He's the nephew many generations removed of the Confederate General Robert E. Lee. His new book, ""A Sin By Any Other Name,"" is available now. Reverend Lee, thank you so much for talking with us.

Barbershop: The Curious Case Of Julian Assange,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/13/713097734/barbershop-the-curious-case-of-julian-assange,"In the Barbershop, NPR's Michel Martin speaks with journalist Margaret Sullivan and former CIA deputy director John McLaughlin about whether Julian Assange's actions are heroic or treacherous.
MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:
We're going to begin the program today by taking another look at the arrest of the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange. The details on the optics of the arrest Thursday were certainly dramatic - a bearded Assange dragged from Ecuador's Embassy in London after nearly seven years inside. Demonstrators and op-ed writers rallied to his defense while critics leaked negative details about everything from his hygiene to his cat.
Apart from all of that, though, Assange's actions and his arrest raise serious questions about the seriousness of the accusations against Assange and what the response should be. And these are questions, it has to be said, that divide journalists and national security experts, so we've decided to take this up in our weekly Barbershop because this is where we talk to interesting people about what's in the news and what's on their minds. And for this conversation, we've called upon Margaret Sullivan, media columnist with The Washington Post. She's with us from New York City.
Margaret, thanks so much for joining us once again.
MARGARET SULLIVAN: Thanks, Michel. Nice to be with you again.
MARTIN: And John McLaughlin is the former deputy director of the Central Intelligence Agency. He's been kind enough to join us from Virginia.
Mr. McLaughlin, welcome. Thank you so much for joining us as well.
JOHN MCLAUGHLIN: Hi, Michel.
MARTIN: So I think most people know who care about this or the basic facts - the government says that Assange conspired with former U.S. Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning to crack a classified Defense Department password, and he was charged under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.
Now, Margaret, you are clear that journalists are divided about this, saying on the one hand, some people think that he engaged in, you know, reckless, thoughtless behavior, but that others say that while he may be a bit radical about his position about government transparency, at his core, he is a publisher who takes a position for the sake of government accountability, and thus he should be afforded protection. Would it be fair to say that that's the direction you lean on this?
SULLIVAN: Well, you know, I guess my stance on this is a little - it's a little bit in between those things. I don't actually see Julian Assange at this point of his career or his life as a journalist. I don't think we can call him a journalist. I think we can say that Wikileaks is a publisher. He may be all of those negative things that you said. He may be reckless. He may have done bad things.
My concern is that in going after him and indicting him and prosecuting him, what happens within that is that regular journalists - you know, legitimate journalists - will also suffer the consequences because many of the sort of methods that have been identified in the indictment are things - are actually best practices for national security journalists and others around the country and around the world.
MARTIN: Well, give an example.
(CROSSTALK)
MARTIN: You did write a whole column about this, so I would refer people to it. But just give me an example of what you think he did that legitimate journalists also do besides publish things that other people don't want them to see. Because some of - you know...
SULLIVAN: He protected...
MARTIN: Some journalists say no - say that, you know, hacking into things, inducing somebody else to hack into a classified entity - that is not something other journalists would do.
SULLIVAN: Right. This doesn't - this is not, in my mind, a judgment on whether we like Julian Assange or what he has revealed. It's not at all that. The question is, in pursuing this, are we going to criminalize best practices that journalists use - such as using encryption, such as source protection, such as asking a source for information?
MARTIN: OK. Mr. McLaughlin, what about you? You say - you've written about this as well, and you said that you don't consider Assange's activity journalism for a number of reasons. You say his main target is the United States, not corruption more broadly. Others have written about the fact that he had ample opportunity to publish information about Russia's activities in Ukraine, for example, and didn't do so. So what do you say about all this?
MCLAUGHLIN: Well, that's the main point, Michel. The fact that - I don't see him as a legitimate journalist because a couple of reasons. First, it isn't just that he published material that people don't want to see published. That's not really the issue. If he actually conspired to help break into a Pentagon computer, that's not something a legitimate journalist does.
Also, when he gave this material to mainstream journalists, my understanding from what I've heard said by people who worked with him is that many people wanted to take out material that would have endangered the lives of Afghans and Iraqis who had given information to the United States about al-Qaida, for example. And he didn't want to do that, whereas a legitimate journalist will at least listen to that case. And that's basically my objection to him. I don't see him as a legitimate journalist at all.
MARTIN: And what about Margaret's point, though, that by - that arresting him and prosecuting him will have a chilling effect on legitimate journalists who do protect sources and who sometimes do come into possession of materials that governments would not want them to have? What would you say about that?
MARTIN: Well, I don't think journalists should be prosecuted or arrested for those practices, which are all legitimate, freedom of speech practice that we all support. That's not why he will be accused, I think. He not only apparently - we have to find out, give him a fair trial if it gets a trial - might have broken into, helped break into a Pentagon computer. But also, if you look at Robert Mueller's indictments of the 12 Russian GRU officers who were instrumental in interfering in our election, it's quite clear from that and also from what the intelligence community published and declassified in January of 2017 that that dump of documents went to WikiLeaks and - via a couple of online personages that the Russians invented - Guccifer 2.0 and DCLeaks.
So again, I don't know whether that's going to turn out to be something on which he can be legitimately indicted. I just have no idea. But when Mueller's report is fully revealed, we may discover that there's an angle there that goes beyond what we would normally think of a legitimate journalist as doing.
MARTIN: So, Margaret, what about Mr. McLaughlin's point that journalists would engage in some form of test, best balancing test, within their own organization before choosing to publish something? I mean, he in - Mr. McLaughlin in his writing about this said this is more like an intelligence activity. He just sort of threw this information out there. There doesn't seem to have been any discretion, any thought about sort of balancing the public interest in knowing versus the harm that it could do. What do you say about that?
SULLIVAN: Well, I think that Mr. McLaughlin is 100 percent right about that. There was a time earlier on - you know, it's getting to be 10 years ago - when Julian Assange did more of that kind of thing - redacting things that could be problematic or harmful, even, I think, consulting or allowing the information to be worked over by government sources or seen by government sources.
But I think those issues are - they don't go to the heart of my concern. It may well be that Julian Assange is - as I said, is reckless, is a negative force, has done things that have hurt people. I recognize that. However, I am fearful that in going after him - you know, again, going after him in this particular way and casting his method of protecting his source of - this is all in the indictment.
This is part of - you know, seen as part of the so-called conspiracy, that he conspired to protect his source, that he conspired to encrypt information. And again, if those things are seen to be criminal, we're all in big trouble. And, you know, we've suffered a very difficult blow to the kinds of reporting that, you know, that do serve the public interest.
MARTIN: You know, it's interesting because, Mr. McLaughlin, you also expressed ambivalence about prosecuting him. You said that - you know, you were asked if - do you think that the U.S. government could and should charge him for publishing these secrets? And you said, I think it's a close call. You said emotionally, you would say yes, you know. But you also said that you were ambivalent because it's clear that he will seek martyr status. You can already see it. You know, people are going to be...
MCLAUGHLIN: Yeah.
MARTIN: ...Printing up T-shirts. So tell me more about your feelings about that. Are you saying you really - even though you are a career intelligence officer, you're saying maybe he shouldn't be prosecuted - not because he didn't do wrong in your view but because you think of the effect that it would create among people who support him?
MCLAUGHLIN: Well, my heart tells me yes, but my head tells me no. No, because I don't think we want to conspire in an effort for - that he would like to have us conspire in - for him to be a martyr. And I also take Margaret's point that I don't think anyone here wants to do anything that jeopardizes journalists' ability to keep the security of their sources - after all, intelligence officers have that same interest - and - nor interfere with their ability to encrypt things and so forth.
So if that's part of an indictment, I think prosecutors and defenders will have to work through that to sort of segregate what is it that he can be legitimately charged with here without endangering freedom of speech, the First Amendment or the rights of journalists. I'm all for avoiding those dangers.
Again, my objections are if journalists - legitimate ones - do not conspire to break into government computers, if we condone that, then your computer isn't safe, and my computer isn't safe. And also, when I've had journalists call me when I've been in government with a story that conceivably could harm sources, for example, or could bring harm to other Americans, they would give you a chance to make your case. And sometimes, they would hold parts of a story, and sometimes they wouldn't. You would lose your case sometimes, and sometimes you would win it. And I've done that with major newspapers and found them extremely responsible and recognized the dilemma they struggle with. There was none of that with him.
MARTIN: OK.
MCLAUGHLIN: It was just all out the door. And I think that's to be condemned.
MARTIN: All right. As this case continues, we'll call you both back and ask you both your opinion of it and what you think should happen next and in the future. That was John McLaughlin, former deputy director of the CIA. He's now teaching at Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies. Margaret Sullivan was with us, media columnist with The Washington Post. She's the former public editor for The New York Times.
I thank you both so much for talking with us today.
MCLAUGHLIN: Thanks, Michel.
SULLIVAN: Thanks very much.

Yo-Yo Ma Plays Bach In Shadow Of Texas Border Crossing,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/13/713092703/cellist-yo-yo-ma-plays-bach-in-shadow-of-border-crossing?station=KXJZ_FM,"Enlarge this image Yo-Yo Ma brought his Bach Project to the sister cities of Laredo, Texas, and Nuevo Laredo, Mexico.

Terrazas/Texas Public Radio Yo-Yo Ma brought his Bach Project to the sister cities of Laredo, Texas, and Nuevo Laredo, Mexico. The project uses the music of Johann Sebastian Bach to explore connections between cultures.
Lauren A. Terrazas/Texas Public Radio World-renowned cellist Yo-Yo Ma brought his Bach Project to the sister cities of Laredo, Texas, and Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, on Saturday. The ""Day of Action"" featured performances in both cities to celebrate the relationship between the two communities.
Ma played the opening notes of Johann Sebastian Bach's Suite No. 1 for Unaccompanied Cello in a park next to the Juarez-Lincoln International Bridge, one of the crossings that connect the U.S. and Mexican cities.
The Laredo performance took place on an elevated stage before an audience of officials and onlookers. Concerns over possible rain disappeared as Ma began to play in the morning sunshine.
Texas Public Radio via YouTube It was part of his Bach Project, which uses the composer's 300-year-old music to explore connections between cultures. The project has taken Ma all over the world. On Friday it brought him to Laurie Auditorium at Trinity University in San Antonio, and on Saturday it brought him to Laredo, within a few feet of the Rio Grande.
""As you all know, as you did and do and will do, in culture, we build bridges, not walls,"" he said. After his performance, he gestured to the bridge to his right. ""I've lived my life at the borders. Between cultures. Between disciplines. Between musics. Between generations.""
Mateo Bailey, 16, lives in San Antonio. He grew up in El Paso, plays the cello and is the son of Grammy Award-winning cellist Zuill Bailey.
He felt Ma's performance had special significance ""because this event is on the border. And I'm half-Mexican as well as half-American ... and for him to connect cello with what's happening in the world is like, it's a cultural bridge that was just built, and it's amazing.""
Betty DeLeon praised the cellist for visiting. ""It speaks of him. What a wonderful human being to take his time and come to our tiny little town to share the importance of culture. On the border. It's amazing. It's a privilege to be a part of this.""
Pete Saenz, mayor of Laredo, said that despite the river and despite the bridge spanning overhead, the border is one community.
""And although people may perceive us as being so different, we're not,"" he said. ""Here the border is extremely unique in that it's one organism. I've always said we're interdependent, interconnected. We survived because the border side survives, especially here on the border area.""
This Day of Action also included a performance in Plaza Juarez in Nuevo Laredo, a few blocks from the international crossing. Its overall theme was an appreciation for the connections between the two cities, which see themselves as one community.
Ma was originally scheduled to play on the actual bridge, which would have been briefly closed. The planned closure would have been a collaborative effort between officials and residents on both sides of the border. But the traffic and pedestrian delays that the performance would have caused convinced officials to move the locale to the Tres Laredos Park right next to the bridge.
The famous cellist has studied and performed the German composer's music for six decades.
In 2018, Ma set out on a two-year journey to perform Bach's six suites for solo cello in 36 locations around the world. He believes the music has an ability to connect cultures and humanity from all walks of life. He said that this is what motivated him to launch the project."
"Calls For More Police Training On Disabilities Like Autism, Down Syndrome",www.npr.org,npr.org,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/13/705887493/how-one-mothers-battle-is-changing-police-training-on-disabilities?station=KXJZ_FM,"Enlarge this image Patti Saylor says that after her son Ethan's death in 2013, she realized that police officers need more training in working with people who have intellectual and developmental disabilities.

toggle caption Meg Anderson/NPR Patti Saylor says that after her son Ethan's death in 2013, she realized that police officers need more training in working with people who have intellectual and developmental disabilities.
Meg Anderson/NPR Working with people who have intellectual and developmental disabilities, like Down syndrome or autism, can be complex and challenging even for those with years of training. But one group — law enforcement — often encounters people with these conditions in high-stress situations, with little or no training at all.
Patti Saylor knows all too well what the consequences of that can be.
Her son Ethan, who had Down syndrome, died after an encounter with law enforcement when he was 26. It's a tragedy she believes could have been prevented.
In January 2013, Ethan went to see the movie Zero Dark Thirty at a mall in Frederick County, Md. Afterward, when his support aide went to get the car, Ethan went back inside to try to see the movie a second time, but he didn't buy a new ticket.
Three off-duty sheriff's deputies, who were working as security guards, confronted him.
""He didn't cooperate, of course,"" Patti Saylor says. ""He didn't want to leave. At that point, I believe, he wouldn't know what was going on.""
According to a civil lawsuit filed by Ethan's parents, the deputies ""tried to drag him from the theater,"" and Ethan ""ended up on the floor with at least one deputy on top of him."" The deputies said Ethan was asked to leave before they took him by the arms. They denied any wrongdoing in the case, which reached a settlement last year .
There on the floor of the movie theater, Ethan stopped breathing. He was later pronounced dead at a local hospital. His death, from asphyxia, was ruled a homicide . A Frederick County grand jury cleared the deputies of criminal charges.
Ever since, Patti Saylor has been fighting to change the way law enforcement personnel are trained when encountering people like Ethan. She says families like hers — with firsthand knowledge — have a unique perspective.
""We know something the police don't know,"" Patti Saylor says. ""I felt like we needed to teach them, and then hold them accountable.""

Meg Anderson/NPR ""It's not always resistance""
Ethan Saylor's death highlighted the lack of training many law enforcement officers have when it comes to people with intellectual or developmental disabilities.
StoryCorps A Mother Of A Son With Autism Thanks A Stranger Who Helped: 'Nobody Does What You Do' Instead, much of their training revolves around how to gain and maintain control of a situation. Police training programs nationwide spend, on average, 168 hours teaching officers about use of force, weapons and defensive tactics, according to the most recent statistics from the Justice Department. That compares with only 10 hours spent on mental illness, for example. For that report, the government did not track the training time devoted to intellectual and developmental disabilities.
Police training often creates the mindset: ""I am the boss. You do what I tell you to do,"" says Seth Stoughton, a former police officer and now a University of South Carolina law professor who studies police regulation. ""And if someone doesn't do what I tell them to do, it is indicative of a potential threat.""
Experts say people with intellectual disabilities may have trouble processing those orders. They may struggle to follow directions or manage emotions.
""It's not always noncompliance. It's not always resistance. Sometimes it's inability,"" Stoughton explains. ""The officer very often will perceive that inability as a refusal.""
Some police training addresses intellectual and developmental disabilities within what is known as crisis intervention training, which largely focuses on mental illness and substance abuse. At least 27 states and the District of Columbia require officers to be taught how to respond to someone with mental health or substance abuse issues, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
Stoughton says the skills taught in those types of training — good communication skills, practicing patience, and earning a person's cooperation — may apply when responding to a person with an intellectual or developmental disability.
But, he says, the signs of a mental health crisis don't always apply to someone with this type of disability. Without specific training on these disabilities, he says, an officer might not recognize that they should adjust their behavior.
""Different tools to use on the street""
Six years after Ethan Saylor's death, Maryland has become a leader among states in requiring police training on how to respond to people with intellectual and developmental disabilities.
The Maryland Police and Correctional Training Commissions adopted the new requirements statewide in 2014. The next year, the state established the Ethan Saylor Alliance , which helps ensure that people with these types of disabilities play a central role in the training.
Two professors at Loyola University Maryland, Lisa Schoenbrodt and Leah Saal, developed one such training. With a state grant , they hired 10 adults with a range of disabilities to role-play common scenarios with police. Last fall, they piloted the class at Prince George's Community College.

Meg Anderson/NPR ""If we can provide a different perspective and give them different tools to use on the street, I just think that's great,"" says Percy Alston, the director of the college's Public Safety and Security Institute.
Alston is responsible for training new and experienced police officers on how responding to people with these disabilities might be different than what officers are used to. He cites one very basic example: A lot of police officers don't like to be touched.
""Once I put my uniform on, I'm like Superman; you can't touch my cape. But there are people with certain disabilities that do like to touch,"" Alston explains. ""So them touching you is not going to be an assault.""
On a Friday morning at the police academy, Alston leads about a dozen officers through the first half of the class, and then the Loyola trainers role-play with some of the officers. In one scenario, trainer Elaina Camacho, who has autism, played a daughter who threatens her mom. Officer Joseph Powell, who works with the Prince George's County public schools, calmed Camacho down by doing something unusual: He asked to play her video game while they talked.
Alston says that moment gets at the heart of what the class is all about. He knows that officers have to think fast and respond quickly, and they must protect their own safety. But when they encounter someone who has an intellectual or developmental disability, they may need to slow down and approach things in a different way.
Patti Saylor believes that could have made the difference for Ethan.
""So many police officers have asked me, what should they have done? And I said, 'Well, you've got to use your bag of tricks,' "" she says. In Ethan's case, ""if you really wanted him to leave, you may have said, 'let's go on out here and get a snack while we wait for your mother.' ""
""There's no magic pixie dust,"" she adds. ""It is relationship."""
"Viral Stars, The 'Syncopated Ladies,' Shake Up Tap Dancing",www.npr.org,npr.org,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/13/713097764/viral-stars-the-syncopated-ladies-shake-up-tap-dancing?station=KXJZ_FM,"NPR's Michel Martin speaks with tap dancer Chloe Arnold, of the Syncopated Ladies, about their viral dance videos and annual tap festival.
Finally today, let's talk about tap dance. And we're not talking about politicians trying to get out of answering hard questions. And we're not even talking about another image you might have of old guys in tuxedos from the 1940s. No, we're talking about the Syncopated Ladies, an all-female tap squad that has become an Internet sensation for their tight moves set to popular music, think Prince and Beyonce.
(SOUNDBITE OF SYNCOPATED LADIES PERFORMANCE)
MARTIN: You might have caught them on the TV show ""So You Think You Can Dance"" or featured on Beyonce's home page. Two sisters, Maud and Chloe Arnold, founded the group. They're here in Washington, D.C., this weekend for their annual concert and showcase. So we thought this was a good time to hear more about the group and how they're changing the look of tap.
And Chloe Arnold is with us now to represent both sisters. And she's with us now. Welcome. Thank you so much for joining us.
CHLOE ARNOLD: Thank you Michel. I'm so, so happy to be here. And I'm really excited to talk about tap dancing.
MARTIN: And thanks for taking time out of a really busy schedule of master classes and all the things that you're doing. As I mentioned, this is your hometown. How did you get started in tap dancing? Was it, like, the usual you had too much energy, so mom put you in a class?
ARNOLD: Well, my mom did dance for fun when she was growing up. And so it was something that she wanted to just share with her kids. And then she saw that we were really loving it. And so she started to seek out more opportunities.
MARTIN: What is it that you think you love about tap?
ARNOLD: I think that, for me, when you're tap dancing, you are a musician and a dancer. And what I love about tap is you can, you know, it's percussive, so you can do it to any kind of music. And I have a broad taste of music. So it allows me to lock into any pocket and to really express myself.
And there's an element of improvisation within tap that fits my personality well because I love to improvise and freestyle and make things up in the moment.
MARTIN: And I noticed that after college, you formed a dance company with your sister, Maud. And I wondered what made you think this could be a career because, you know, frankly, tap isn't something that - well, when you were kind of developing the form, it isn't something that you saw a lot of except on - say, on period pieces, on Broadway...
ARNOLD: Correct.
MARTIN: ...You know like - you know, or, you know, or The Rockettes, which is just, you know, not everybody's cup of tea. So what made you think that you could kind of take this someplace?
ARNOLD: So when we were growing up here in D.C., an incredible woman, Debbie Allen, came and we got to be in a play of hers at the Kennedy Center. And so that was my first initial thing of seeing a black woman of excellence be able to shape her own way. And it gave me the confidence that I could do the same.
And so then I actually went to Columbia University. And I studied film. And I thought to myself you know how I'm going to do this? I'm going to put tap dance in TV, music videos and film. And so the way that Syncopated Ladies started to make our imprint was to show people the way that I imagined our art, meaning full of black girl magic, full of rhythm, syncopation, body, curves. We say fierce footwork with a female force.
And so when we're creating, you know, what I was seeing when I was in college in New York was there were just not really any roles for African-American women in tap dance. If you were going to be on Broadway, it's all chorus girls, which means a line of women, and you really have to - at that time - fit into that line, right? And my body type with curves and - there's just not a lot of black women, and they're definitely not curvy women.
MARTIN: There's just so many - a couple things I wanted to dig into. Like, first of all, one of the things that I saw at your shows is exactly the point that you just made. One of the things that really struck me is there was every kind of person in it. There was young people. There were kids. There were older. They were every race. And they were all different kinds of body types...
ARNOLD: Yes.
MARTIN: ...And one of the biggest applauses went to a larger-sized woman - frankly, not the type of body type that I think most people associate with professional dance. And it was just, you know, it was just kind of eye opening. And I was wondering how your philosophy around this came about, that not just that anybody could take your classes, but that people with all these different body types can perform?
ARNOLD: Yes, the woman that you're speaking of, she was our student from when she was 10-years-old. And when she came first to us, she did have self-doubt and was under the lens and microscope of not fitting in. And we literally have worked with her over the past 10 years to get her to a place where she can walk on that stage in that bright yellow shirt shining whereas before as a kid, she would been hiding. And so it takes time. And it takes effort. And it takes, like, a vision that you see - again, the deeper excellence in a human. And that is the part that makes artists amazing. It's not being cookie cutter.
MARTIN: Well, also, your work is being recognized. I mean, you earned an Emmy nomination for your work on ""The Late Late Show With James Corden."" Congratulations for that.
ARNOLD: Thank you. Thank you so much.
MARTIN: But I also - tell us about the episode that you choreographed. It just sounds crazy.
ARNOLD: Oh, my God. So first of all, I love James Corden. I love ""The Late Late Show"" because it is literally unlimited adventure. You know, this particular one is called Crosswalk Musical. And this one was with Hugh Jackman, Zendaya and Zac Efron and James Corden in the crosswalk on Broadway in New York City with a cast of 16 dancers. And we put on basically 40 second musicals in the crosswalk.
(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, ""THE LATE LATE SHOW WITH JAMES CORDEN"")
UNIDENTIFIED SINGERS: (Singing) The people ride in a hole in the ground. New York, New York, it's a hell of a town. Cars, cars, cars. Wow. Wow.
ARNOLD: And it is absolutely hysterical. And people ask me all the time, is that real? And it is totally real. We are literally in the street during the time that the light is red. We put on a musical. And when they are running, they are running because the light is going to change.
MARTIN: That is crazy. That sounded crazy.
ARNOLD: It is absolutely nuts. And it's so fun. And it's really been great for dance and for art to just again, expand the creativity and create more opportunity.
MARTIN: Well, you certainly are expanding, I think, people's vision of what tap can be. Finally, before I let you go, what do you think it is that we still like about tap? As I said that for people whose only vision of it is like, you know, The Rockettes - no disrespect to The Rockettes - you know, or the Hines brothers back in the day, I mean, Savion Glover, of course. So I mean, maybe people will have seen him. But what is it that you think we still like about it because one of the things, again, that was fascinating about your showcase is that all kinds of people were there. There was every kind of person there - all ages, all races, all, you know, what is it that you think we still like about it?
ARNOLD: Well, artistically speaking, you know, percussion is mesmerizing. I mean, the drum is the essence, honestly, of the heartbeat. It is from - it is the origin - original African expression and music. So the drum and that idea that our feet are, you know, we are the drum in our physicality our oral and visual presentation. And I think that that is just honestly an innate human connection that people have.
So I think that rhythm is what draws everyone together. And I think, though, then the part that keeps you is style because then the style is reflective of the individual person's journey and experience and culture and where they come from. And then that, again, captivates different people based around their own life experience.
MARTIN: That is the Emmy nominated choreographer and dancer Chloe Arnold. She's the co-founder with her sister of Syncopated Ladies. And she's teaching and performing this weekend in Washington, D.C., at the D.C. Tap Festival. And Chloe Arnold, thank you so much for talking with us.
ARNOLD: Thank you for having me. I love NPR. And I really, really appreciate being here.

Nephew Of Robert E. Lee Grapples With Legacy Of American Race Relations In New Book,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/13/713097741/nephew-of-robert-e-lee-grapples-with-legacy-of-american-race-relations-in-new-bo?station=KXJZ_FM,"Robert W. Lee tells NPR's Michel Martin what it's like to grapple with the legacy of his ancestor, Confederate General Robert E. Lee. He wrote about this in a memoir, ""A Sin by Any Other Name.""
In the South, the name Robert E. Lee is everywhere. Schools, parks, streets, entire counties bear the name of the leader of the Confederate Army during the Civil War. More recently, statues in his honor have been at the center of heated debates including in Charlottesville, Va., where the statue was the purported emphasis for the white supremacist rally there in 2017.
My next guest is also a Robert Lee - the Reverend Robert W. Lee. He is the nephew of the famous general many generations removed and grew up with reverence for him. He still has that reverence, but he's also grappling with the meaning of his legacy. And he's urging others, specifically others who share that heritage, to do the same.
He offers his thoughts about all this in a new book, ""A Sin By Any Other Name: Reckoning With Racism And The Heritage Of The South."" And he's with us now from WFAE in Charlotte, N.C. Reverend Lee, welcome. Thank you so much for talking to us.
ROBERT W LEE: Thank you for having me.
MARTIN: So you talk in the book about the first time that you learned you were related to Robert E. Lee from a picture hanging in your grandmother's house. Do you remember, you know, what that felt like when you heard about this, when you learned this?
LEE: I think in the South, there is a certain reverence, as you said, and a certain awe for the man named Robert E. Lee. Regardless of what you think of him and what he did, he is a staple of Southern culture. And so when I found out that I was related to him, and a close relation at that, it was as if my world had been shaken in the best way possible. It's like told - being told you're related to a celebrity down here.
MARTIN: One of the things about your book that I like is that, you know, what we often as journalists report on history as these big cataclysmic moments, right? But you describe, like, a series of smaller, quieter moments that influenced your thinking. Could you just talk a little bit about how your image of him first became complicated or more nuanced?
LEE: I grew up under the care of a nurse named Janie Bowman (ph) who really cared for me. She was a woman of color. She was someone who was 60, 70 years my senior at the time that I met her. And she would cook me sausage. She would take me for a walk. She would read the Psalms to me.
But she also understood that down here in the south, even in the 1990s when I was a kid, Jim Crow still lived. And so she wouldn't eat after me. She wouldn't use the same utensils or the same glasses that we had at my house because it was Robert Lee's house. You don't do that. That was just her understanding of the Jim Crow South at the time. And I've struggled with that ever since, this reality that I bear a name that has caused such pain not only for people that I love, but for this nation as well.
MARTIN: But you still went to an all-white Christian academy - right? - one of those seg academies that was set up specifically to avoid the court-ordered desegregation of the public school system there, right? Did you ever ask about that? Did you ever wonder, like, why?
LEE: To this day, I still wonder why. And it was an all right school. They were nice to me. But we had lunch catered from outside venues - from fast food joints or from the local Japanese restaurant while our friends over at Statesville Middle School were eating lunches that probably shouldn't have been eaten by anyone.
So this was a dichotomy and a juxtaposition that I still live with to this day. And I hope and pray that this book will give us a chance to reconcile those realities.
MARTIN: In the book, the events in Charlottesville in 2017 were a turning point for you. That's when the - of course, I think most people will remember that these white nationalists were marching through the city. And it purportedly started as a protest against the removal of a statue of Robert E. Lee. And then of course, the activist young woman Heather Heyer was killed. A number of people were injured.
The fact that reverence for Robert E. Lee allegedly was at the center of that chaos and violence, was that something that was transformative for you?
LEE: It broke my heart. I've had the opportunity to befriend Susan Bro, the mother of Heather Heyer who was killed in Charlottesville. And when my book came out, she said, stay strong. Keep the faith and keep fighting. And that gave me a lot of hope because if she can reconcile with herself the fact that my ancestor's statue caused this problem, then we can work together still. We can still confront racism as we do together with her foundation, the Heather Heyer Foundation. We can do this.
MARTIN: I'm wondering if - I don't think you have kids yet, you and your wife. But if you should have a son, what are you thinking about - Emmett? I don't know. What - Bill? Is Robert still on the table?
LEE: Well, I can tell you - and my wife - first of all, for all of you who are worried, my wife gave me permission to say this - we are not going to name our child Robert Lee if we have a boy. We are going to end it here because for us, the weight of this name is growing as people seek to create a racist reality. People are venerating this name instead of living into it as a sinful past.
So my wife and I have thought about Elliott, which is the middle name of my mentor who preached my ordination service. We've thought about a few different names. But those are some that come to mind. And we just want to have a future filled with hope, not one filled with a past that is deeply broken.
MARTIN: Well, good luck. Keep us posted on all of those developments if you don't mind. All right.
LEE: Yes, ma'am. Thank you.
MARTIN: The Reverend Robert W. Lee. He's the nephew many generations removed of the Confederate General Robert E. Lee. His new book, ""A Sin By Any Other Name,"" is available now. Reverend Lee, thank you so much for talking with us.

Barbershop: The Curious Case Of Julian Assange,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/13/713097734/barbershop-the-curious-case-of-julian-assange?station=KXJZ_FM,"In the Barbershop, NPR's Michel Martin speaks with journalist Margaret Sullivan and former CIA deputy director John McLaughlin about whether Julian Assange's actions are heroic or treacherous.
We're going to begin the program today by taking another look at the arrest of the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange. The details on the optics of the arrest Thursday were certainly dramatic - a bearded Assange dragged from Ecuador's Embassy in London after nearly seven years inside. Demonstrators and op-ed writers rallied to his defense while critics leaked negative details about everything from his hygiene to his cat.
Apart from all of that, though, Assange's actions and his arrest raise serious questions about the seriousness of the accusations against Assange and what the response should be. And these are questions, it has to be said, that divide journalists and national security experts, so we've decided to take this up in our weekly Barbershop because this is where we talk to interesting people about what's in the news and what's on their minds. And for this conversation, we've called upon Margaret Sullivan, media columnist with The Washington Post. She's with us from New York City.
Margaret, thanks so much for joining us once again.
MARGARET SULLIVAN: Thanks, Michel. Nice to be with you again.
MARTIN: And John McLaughlin is the former deputy director of the Central Intelligence Agency. He's been kind enough to join us from Virginia.
Mr. McLaughlin, welcome. Thank you so much for joining us as well.
JOHN MCLAUGHLIN: Hi, Michel.
MARTIN: So I think most people know who care about this or the basic facts - the government says that Assange conspired with former U.S. Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning to crack a classified Defense Department password, and he was charged under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.
Now, Margaret, you are clear that journalists are divided about this, saying on the one hand, some people think that he engaged in, you know, reckless, thoughtless behavior, but that others say that while he may be a bit radical about his position about government transparency, at his core, he is a publisher who takes a position for the sake of government accountability, and thus he should be afforded protection. Would it be fair to say that that's the direction you lean on this?
SULLIVAN: Well, you know, I guess my stance on this is a little - it's a little bit in between those things. I don't actually see Julian Assange at this point of his career or his life as a journalist. I don't think we can call him a journalist. I think we can say that Wikileaks is a publisher. He may be all of those negative things that you said. He may be reckless. He may have done bad things.
My concern is that in going after him and indicting him and prosecuting him, what happens within that is that regular journalists - you know, legitimate journalists - will also suffer the consequences because many of the sort of methods that have been identified in the indictment are things - are actually best practices for national security journalists and others around the country and around the world.
MARTIN: Well, give an example.
(CROSSTALK)
MARTIN: You did write a whole column about this, so I would refer people to it. But just give me an example of what you think he did that legitimate journalists also do besides publish things that other people don't want them to see. Because some of - you know...
SULLIVAN: He protected...
MARTIN: Some journalists say no - say that, you know, hacking into things, inducing somebody else to hack into a classified entity - that is not something other journalists would do.
SULLIVAN: Right. This doesn't - this is not, in my mind, a judgment on whether we like Julian Assange or what he has revealed. It's not at all that. The question is, in pursuing this, are we going to criminalize best practices that journalists use - such as using encryption, such as source protection, such as asking a source for information?
MARTIN: OK. Mr. McLaughlin, what about you? You say - you've written about this as well, and you said that you don't consider Assange's activity journalism for a number of reasons. You say his main target is the United States, not corruption more broadly. Others have written about the fact that he had ample opportunity to publish information about Russia's activities in Ukraine, for example, and didn't do so. So what do you say about all this?
MCLAUGHLIN: Well, that's the main point, Michel. The fact that - I don't see him as a legitimate journalist because a couple of reasons. First, it isn't just that he published material that people don't want to see published. That's not really the issue. If he actually conspired to help break into a Pentagon computer, that's not something a legitimate journalist does.
Also, when he gave this material to mainstream journalists, my understanding from what I've heard said by people who worked with him is that many people wanted to take out material that would have endangered the lives of Afghans and Iraqis who had given information to the United States about al-Qaida, for example. And he didn't want to do that, whereas a legitimate journalist will at least listen to that case. And that's basically my objection to him. I don't see him as a legitimate journalist at all.
MARTIN: And what about Margaret's point, though, that by - that arresting him and prosecuting him will have a chilling effect on legitimate journalists who do protect sources and who sometimes do come into possession of materials that governments would not want them to have? What would you say about that?
MARTIN: Well, I don't think journalists should be prosecuted or arrested for those practices, which are all legitimate, freedom of speech practice that we all support. That's not why he will be accused, I think. He not only apparently - we have to find out, give him a fair trial if it gets a trial - might have broken into, helped break into a Pentagon computer. But also, if you look at Robert Mueller's indictments of the 12 Russian GRU officers who were instrumental in interfering in our election, it's quite clear from that and also from what the intelligence community published and declassified in January of 2017 that that dump of documents went to WikiLeaks and - via a couple of online personages that the Russians invented - Guccifer 2.0 and DCLeaks.
So again, I don't know whether that's going to turn out to be something on which he can be legitimately indicted. I just have no idea. But when Mueller's report is fully revealed, we may discover that there's an angle there that goes beyond what we would normally think of a legitimate journalist as doing.
MARTIN: So, Margaret, what about Mr. McLaughlin's point that journalists would engage in some form of test, best balancing test, within their own organization before choosing to publish something? I mean, he in - Mr. McLaughlin in his writing about this said this is more like an intelligence activity. He just sort of threw this information out there. There doesn't seem to have been any discretion, any thought about sort of balancing the public interest in knowing versus the harm that it could do. What do you say about that?
SULLIVAN: Well, I think that Mr. McLaughlin is 100 percent right about that. There was a time earlier on - you know, it's getting to be 10 years ago - when Julian Assange did more of that kind of thing - redacting things that could be problematic or harmful, even, I think, consulting or allowing the information to be worked over by government sources or seen by government sources.
But I think those issues are - they don't go to the heart of my concern. It may well be that Julian Assange is - as I said, is reckless, is a negative force, has done things that have hurt people. I recognize that. However, I am fearful that in going after him - you know, again, going after him in this particular way and casting his method of protecting his source of - this is all in the indictment.
This is part of - you know, seen as part of the so-called conspiracy, that he conspired to protect his source, that he conspired to encrypt information. And again, if those things are seen to be criminal, we're all in big trouble. And, you know, we've suffered a very difficult blow to the kinds of reporting that, you know, that do serve the public interest.
MARTIN: You know, it's interesting because, Mr. McLaughlin, you also expressed ambivalence about prosecuting him. You said that - you know, you were asked if - do you think that the U.S. government could and should charge him for publishing these secrets? And you said, I think it's a close call. You said emotionally, you would say yes, you know. But you also said that you were ambivalent because it's clear that he will seek martyr status. You can already see it. You know, people are going to be...
MCLAUGHLIN: Yeah.
MARTIN: ...Printing up T-shirts. So tell me more about your feelings about that. Are you saying you really - even though you are a career intelligence officer, you're saying maybe he shouldn't be prosecuted - not because he didn't do wrong in your view but because you think of the effect that it would create among people who support him?
MCLAUGHLIN: Well, my heart tells me yes, but my head tells me no. No, because I don't think we want to conspire in an effort for - that he would like to have us conspire in - for him to be a martyr. And I also take Margaret's point that I don't think anyone here wants to do anything that jeopardizes journalists' ability to keep the security of their sources - after all, intelligence officers have that same interest - and - nor interfere with their ability to encrypt things and so forth.
So if that's part of an indictment, I think prosecutors and defenders will have to work through that to sort of segregate what is it that he can be legitimately charged with here without endangering freedom of speech, the First Amendment or the rights of journalists. I'm all for avoiding those dangers.
Again, my objections are if journalists - legitimate ones - do not conspire to break into government computers, if we condone that, then your computer isn't safe, and my computer isn't safe. And also, when I've had journalists call me when I've been in government with a story that conceivably could harm sources, for example, or could bring harm to other Americans, they would give you a chance to make your case. And sometimes, they would hold parts of a story, and sometimes they wouldn't. You would lose your case sometimes, and sometimes you would win it. And I've done that with major newspapers and found them extremely responsible and recognized the dilemma they struggle with. There was none of that with him.
MARTIN: OK.
MCLAUGHLIN: It was just all out the door. And I think that's to be condemned.
MARTIN: All right. As this case continues, we'll call you both back and ask you both your opinion of it and what you think should happen next and in the future. That was John McLaughlin, former deputy director of the CIA. He's now teaching at Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies. Margaret Sullivan was with us, media columnist with The Washington Post. She's the former public editor for The New York Times.
I thank you both so much for talking with us today.
MCLAUGHLIN: Thanks, Michel.
SULLIVAN: Thanks very much.

toggle caption courtesy of Amazon Prime Video Donald Glover in a still from Guava Island , which he stars in with Rihanna. The film premiered at Coachella, where Glover's musical act Childish Gambino headlined on Friday.
courtesy of Amazon Prime Video Guava Island , Childish Gambino 's long-awaited new project, has finally arrived. Hot off a headlining Coachella performance Friday night, Guava Island is the proverbial cherry on top of Donald Glover's wildly successful year as a rapper, following his first Billboard No. 1 with ""This Is America"" in 2018 and that song's wins for Song of the Year and Record of the Year at the Grammy awards earlier this year — the first rap song to ever win both those prizes.
Anticipation for Guava Island was first stoked months in advance with a single photo of Glover and Rihanna on set in Cuba, spurring grandiose speculation as to what the project would entail — especially since it's tied to Glover's retirement of the Childish Gambino project. Longtime collaborator Hiro Murai directed (Murai is also the director of the ""This Is America"" video and many episodes of Glover's TV series Atlanta ) and the screenplay was written by Stephen Glover, Donald's brother and a writer on Atlanta.
Almost as if to curtail the expectations, the film itself is a modestly stunning — and at times unnerving — extended music video, shot in 4:3 aspect ratio, about music's power to unite in the face of tyranny and greed. It features three new songs, ""Die With You,"" ""Time"" and the flamenco-tinged ""Saturday,"" as well as renditions of the previously released ""Summertime Magic,"" ""Feels Like Summer"" and notably, a sequence showcasing ""This Is America"" that recalls Murai's music video from last year.
A quick summary of the plot: Glover stars as Deni Maroon, a Purple Rain-esque folk hero and local celebrity on the island — exploited for its natural splendor and transformed into a factory spinning silk run by a single despot, played by Nonso Anozie. Rihanna plays his partner, Kofi Novia. The pair meets in a gorgeous animated backstory at the start of the film. Deni's set on uniting the island with a music festival, but it comes at a cost. Black Panther's Letitia Wright also plays a role.
YouTube
Guava Island is streaming on Amazon for free today until 9 p.m. EST. After that time, it'll be available only to Amazon Prime members. It will also stream once on YouTube's Coachella live stream , starting at 8 p.m ET / 5 p.m. PT."
Writers Guild of America Tells Writers To Fire Their Agents After Talks Fail : NPR,www.npr.org,Sasha Ingber,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/13/713030206/uncharted-waters-union-tells-hollywood-writers-to-fire-their-agents,"Enlarge this image Writers Guild of America West President David Goodman speaks in Los Angeles at the 2019 union award ceremony.

toggle caption Frazer Harrison/Getty Images Writers Guild of America West President David Goodman speaks in Los Angeles at the 2019 union award ceremony. The WGA instructed is writers to fire their agents on Friday.
Frazer Harrison/Getty Images Thousands of Hollywood writers have been told by the Writers Guild of America to fire their agents — a drastic move that could impinge the production of new TV shows and films.
The abrupt directive on Friday followed a breakdown in negotiations over proposed changes to the agreement that has guided the basic business relationship between writers and agents for the past 43 years.
With talks stalled ahead of a midnight deadline, the WGA sent its 13,000 writers an email with instructions to notify their agents in writing that they cannot represent them until signing a new code of conduct.
""We know that, together, we are about to enter uncharted waters,"" the message stated. ""Life that deviates from the current system might be various degrees of disorienting. But it has become clear that a big change is necessary.""
It was a bold move for a group accustomed to writing its own scripts. ""I guess the idea of taking on our agents is something people never thought we would do,"" said David Goodman, the president of the Writers Guild of America West, in an interview with NPR.
""Studios and networks still need writers to do the work so until agents figure out that they need us more than we need them, we will carry this out,"" said Goodman.
Movies Meet Marsai Martin, The Youngest Executive Producer In Hollywood At the center of the conflict is a complaint among writers that their agents are not just drastically out-earning them, but preventing them from receiving better pay. The dispute threatens to hinder production at a time when the major broadcast networks are typically staffing up for their fall lineups. It could also lead to job losses in the industry.
""This whole fight is really about the fact that in a period of unprecedented profits and growth of our business ... writers themselves are actually earning less,"" said Goodman.
A main point of contention involves what are known as packaging fees, the money that agents get from a studio when they provide a roster of talent for a film or TV project. Traditionally, agents would earn a 10 percent commission for the work their clients receive from a studio. But with packaging fees, they are compensated by the studios directly. ""They are not incentivized to increase the income of those writers,"" Goodman said.
Writers are also protesting a shift in the business model in recent years at some of Hollywood's largest talent agencies. Agents have increasingly entered the film and TV businesses as producers, and writers contend that such a dual-hat arrangement represents a conflict of interest.
Goodman said that in order to break the impasse, the industry needs to return ""to the traditional agent-writer relationship"" where an agent takes 10 percent of a writer's income.
On Saturday, some writers posted images of the letters they had signed and sent to their agents, showing solidarity if not total support.
""I have an amazing agency that represents me,"" screenwriter, actor and comedian Patton Oswalt said on Twitter. ""But I have an even better guild which stands for me.""
""Dammit,"" wrote David Simon , a Baltimore-based author and television writer best known for The Wire . ""Just realized that the [agency agreement] midnight deadline is PST. So I have to stay up another three hours and one minute to send a pic of my naked a** to [the Creative Artists Agency].""
The Association of Talent Agents, which represents the agencies, has promised more transparency when agencies are involved in the production of a film or TV show. The association committed to reopening talks on the issue after two years if the Writers Guild determines that members aren't benefiting.
The association also offered concessions leading up to Friday's breakdown, including a chance to share 80 percent of ""a percentage"" of their profits when packaging fees for a television series are involved.
The guild said that based on the offer they received from agents, that ""percentage"" amounted to 0.8 percent of the money agents make from packaging fees.
ATA also said agencies would spend $6 million over six years to foster a more inclusive environment and insisted they ""are, and always have been, on the side of the writer.""
In a statement, Karen Stuart, the executive director of the ATA, said Friday's failure ""was driven by the Guild's predetermined course for chaos."" She said it would ultimately harm artists.
""The WGA is mandating a 'Code of Conduct' that will hurt all artists, delivering an especially painful blow to mid-level and emerging writers, while dictating how agencies of all sizes should function.""
Goodman said writers are already hurt. He called the proposal ""a ridiculous offer given the fact that the writers are the reason that any television show succeeds.""
Until the impasse is solved, members of the guild have told writers they could turn to managers or lawyers to handle their business affairs.
Lawyers for the ATA threatened to sue the guild, contending that the union was violating California and New York licensing laws. As part of its argument, it said in a letter that the union ""cannot 'delegate' authority it does not have.""
Friday's breakdown in negotiations marked just the latest chapter in the Writers Guild's longstanding aversion to packaging fees. Goodman said the union sought reforms as far back as the 1970s.
""People are saying this is an unprecedented move, but it isn't in the sense that 43 years ago we tried to get rid of packaging and we failed and now it's gotten much worse,"" Goodman said."

SAGAL: You're - so you're a ski guy. That's cool.
T J: I'm a snowboarder. But yeah, we're up there every night just laying down corduroy for the people.
SAGAL: That's really cool. You sound like a snowboarder. I'm just going to go there.
(LAUGHTER)
ALONZO BODDEN: I just want to ask - you live in Vermont. If you had a million dollars...
(LAUGHTER)
BODDEN: ...What would you do with it up there?
T J: Oh, man. I'd probably buy 400,000 snowboards.
SAGAL: Yeah, I was about to say.
(LAUGHTER)
BODDEN: All right.
MAEVE HIGGINS: Why wouldn't you just get one really big one, though?
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Well, T.J., welcome to the show. Bill Kurtis is going to read for you three news-related limericks with the last word or phrase missing from each. If you can fill in that last word or phrase correctly in two of the limericks, you'll be a winner. You ready to play?
T J: Yeah. Let's do it.
SAGAL: All right. Here is your first limerick.
BILL KURTIS: My pet is a bit of a brat. I'm the servant in his habitat. Those who own a sweet dog all live high on the hog. I feel lousy 'cause I have a...
T J: Cat.
SAGAL: Yes.
(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)
SAGAL: Dog owners are happier than cat owners.
(APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: It turns out it's been proven with a new survey showing how dog owners self-identify as very happy, whereas cat owners identify as very ow, why did it bite me again?
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: The survey found dog owners are happier than those with cats. The survey also found - and this is true - that people with cats are less happy than people who have no pets at all.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Now, that doesn't necessarily mean that cats make you unhappy. It may just be that cat owners are miserable losers for entirely different reasons.
(LAUGHTER)
NEGIN FARSAD: Can I just say #NotAllCats? Because...
(LAUGHTER)
FARSAD: I grew up with a really great cat that was basically like a dog. And now I have a dog, and there were like this - I can't even tell them apart. So just...
BODDEN: It's funny how cat people always say that.
SAGAL: Yeah, they always do.
(LAUGHTER)
BODDEN: No, no. My cat is different. No, it's not.
SAGAL: Yes.
(LAUGHTER)
BODDEN: No, it's a cat.
SAGAL: Yeah. Here is your next limerick.
KURTIS: For podcasts, we've got an idea. A Swedish voice sleep panacea. Now HEMNES and MALM will help you stay calm. Our podcast reads names from...
T J: IKEA.
SAGAL: Yes.
(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)
SAGAL: Very good.
(APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: Do you need a new sleep aid? Is our show no longer doing it for you? Ikea is launching a podcast made to help people go to sleep...
FARSAD: Oh, my god.
SAGAL: ...That's what it's for - in which two Swedish men read the names of products...
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: ...From the IKEA catalog, which is a great idea. It's much better than their original idea of reading from the illustrated assembly manual.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Because, like, I don't know, a man with a hammer is sad, and the corner of his table hurts. I...
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: The podcast is advertised as a great way to help people fall asleep. And if you listen to a clip, you can hear why.
(SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST)
UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: BJORKSNAS - chest of five drawers. PUDERVIVA - queen quilt cover set.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Swedish people reading an Ikea catalogue is truly the definition of white noise.
(APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: And if this isn't enough for you, you can turn into IKEA's next podcast from Guy Raz, How The Hell Do You Build This?
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: All right, T.J. Here is your last limerick.
KURTIS: On airplanes, the sound can be crushing when vacuum-sucked water is rushing. Since kids can be scared to use bathrooms mid-air, we have softened the noise of our...
T J: Flushing.
SAGAL: Flushing, right.
(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)
SAGAL: Physicists are working to improve airplane travel but not by making sure your plane doesn't crash. No, they're trying to make sure the toilet isn't too loud. People have been complaining for years about the deafening roar of the airplane toilet flush, saying it terrifies children and masks the other bathroom sounds they do want to hear.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Apparently, designing a quieter mechanism that can function at high altitudes has been a challenge. But engineers have found a way to cut the noise of the flush by 16 decibels - you just put your fingers in your ears...
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: ...Brace your elbows. Unfortunately, they haven't found a way to reduce the sound of the guy in the seat next to you who can't hear himself farting because his headphones are on.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Bill, how did T.J. do on our quiz?
KURTIS: Three and 0 - did very, very well.
SAGAL: Congratulations, T.J.
(APPLAUSE)
T J: Thank you.
SAGAL: Thanks so much for playing.

PETER SAGAL, HOST:
From NPR and WBEZ Chicago, this is WAIT WAIT... DON'T TELL ME, the NPR news quiz. I'm Bill Kurtis. We're playing this week with Maeve Higgins, Alonzo Bodden and Negin Farsad. And here again is your host from Trinity University's Laurie Auditorium in San Antonio, Peter Sagal.
(APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: Thank you, Bill. In just a minute, the rhymes of Texas are upon you in our listener limerick challenge. If you'd like to play, give us a call at 1-888-WAIT-WAIT - that's 1-888-924-8924.
Right now, panel, it is time for a game that we call...
BILL KURTIS: The 2020 dump.
SAGAL: With millions of Americans signing up each day to run for president as a Democrat...
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: ...News about all the candidates is coming in hard and fast. So we're going to ask you about some of them rapid-fire style. Get your question right, you get a point, true or false. Ready to go? Maeve, true or false - at a campaign event in Iowa, Beto O'Rourke got asked for his autograph while in the bathroom.
MAEVE HIGGINS: I would say that's true, actually.
SAGAL: No, it was false. What happened was Beto started talking to this stranger in the bathroom who then asked him, hey, are you here to see Beto O'Rourke?
(LAUGHTER)
HIGGINS: I was imagining that he kind of, like, off - you know, he seems to be very over-familiar. Like, and he gets up on countertops and stuff.
SAGAL: Yes.
HIGGINS: So I was imagining him at a u-rye-nal (ph) kind of stretching across to offer and...
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: I'm sorry, excuse me.
HIGGINS: ...To offer a shake.
ALONZO BODDEN: Yes, she did say...
SAGAL: At a what?
(LAUGHTER)
HIGGINS: U-rye-nal.
BODDEN: Beautiful.
NEGIN FARSAD: It's wrong.
BODDEN: You - no, that is the new way it's pronounced.
SAGAL: Yes. Oh, u-rye-nal.
(LAUGHTER)
HIGGINS: You know, the thing that men stand in front of.
SAGAL: Oh, I know what you're talking about. I've just never heard it...
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: ...Described that way. Is that what they call them in Ireland - a u-rye-nal?
HIGGINS: Yeah. Honestly, I've never used one. But...
(LAUGHTER)
HIGGINS: I know that they've got cakes in them, and I'm always so jealous.
SAGAL: That's true.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Negin, true or false. South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg and his husband Chasten were immortalized in a butter sculpture.
HIGGINS: (Laughter).
FARSAD: That feels true.
SAGAL: No, it's false. It was a diorama made of Marshmallow Peeps.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Alonzo, true or false. Former Virginia governor Terry McAuliffe, who's considering a run, tweeted out a picture of himself as a crab standing on the head of an alligator representing Donald Trump.
BODDEN: Oh, absolutely true.
SAGAL: Absolutely true. We have no idea what it means, but that's what he did.
(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)
SAGAL: Negin, true or false. Candidate Andrew Yang made empowering firefighters part of his official platform.
FARSAD: True.
SAGAL: No, false. He made empowering mixed martial arts fighters part of his official platform.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: And, of course, as for the Republican candidate in 2020, Alonzo, true or false - on a visit to George Washington's residence, Mount Vernon, President Trump said, I'm here to honor the legacy of President Vernon?
(LAUGHTER)
BODDEN: I'm going to go with true on that one also.
SAGAL: No. It's false. What he really said was, quote, ""if Washington was smart, he would have put his name on it. You got to put your name on stuff or no one remembers you.""
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: That's it for our 2020 dump, even though six more people declared while we were playing the game.
(APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: Right now, panel, some more questions for you from the week's news. Maeve, a woman in Taiwan suffering from what she thought was an eye infection learned of this week it was actually what?
HIGGINS: Oh, she was just obsessed.
SAGAL: No.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: She had been working at - does anybody know? This made a lot of news this week. People were, like...
FARSAD: Bumblebees in her...
SAGAL: Yes.
FARSAD: ...Eyeballs?
SAGAL: She had bees living in her eyes.
(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)
HIGGINS: Oh, there was a lot of buzz around this story.
SAGAL: There was, yeah. And the bees were feeding on her tears.
(GROANING)
SAGAL: No, we'll skip the gross parts - which means we will never speak of this again.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: No, these bees had gotten in there while she was gardening. And she started having some eye pain, as will happen, you know, when your eye has bees in them.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: She went to the doctor, and she got her first clue that there might be something seriously wrong when he approached her wearing a head-to-toe white suit and holding one of those smokers.
(LAUGHTER)
FARSAD: I thought he was, like, holding a piece of toast and, like, with butter...
(LAUGHTER)
FARSAD: ...And, like, making breakfast.
BODDEN: But how small were these bees?
SAGAL: These were tiny, little bees.
BODDEN: I didn't know bees...
FARSAD: Yeah.
BODDEN: ...Came in...
HIGGINS: Like humming-bees.
BODDEN: ...Eye-size.
SAGAL: Apparently...
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: They're small enough to fit in there, and she couldn't see them until they looked.
BODDEN: That's one more thing to worry about.
SAGAL: Yeah, I know.

PETER SAGAL, HOST:
Thank you, everybody. Thank you, Bill. Right now it is time for the WAIT WAIT... DON'T TELL ME Bluff The Listener game. Call 1-888-WAIT-WAIT to play our game in the air.
Hi, you are on WAIT WAIT... DON'T TELL ME.
DEVIN O'DONNELL: Hi. This is Devin O'Donnell (ph) from Salt Lake City, Utah.
SAGAL: Salt Lake City is a beautiful place. What do you do there, Devin?
O'DONNELL: So I work at a warehouse during the day, go to cosmetology school at night. And I also work as a drag performer here in the city.
SAGAL: Oh. What - can I ask what your...
(CHEERING, APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: I have a number of questions.
O'DONNELL: (Laughter).
SAGAL: First of all, what is your drag name?
O'DONNELL: It's Gemma Nai (ph).
SAGAL: Gemma Nai. OK.
(CHEERING)
O'DONNELL: Yeah.
(APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: Sounds exotic. And - so when you're in cosmetology school - you're going to be a hairstylist?
O'DONNELL: Yeah, absolutely - hair and makeup.
SAGAL: That's fabulous. Well, as a drag queen, you will absolutely be ready to do that.
O'DONNELL: Yep, it's what got me started.
(CHEERING)
SAGAL: When you think about it...
(APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: ...You want your stylist to be a drag queen.
NEGIN FARSAD: Mmm hmm.
O'DONNELL: Really.
SAGAL: All right.
O'DONNELL: Who knows better how to do makeup than someone who beats their face weekly?
SAGAL: That's true.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Well, Devin, it's nice to have you with us. You're going to play our game in which you must try to tell truth from fiction. What is the topic, Bill?
KURTIS: America, will you go to prom with me?
SAGAL: It's prom season. And that means two things - one, photos your children will regret forever and two, new prom trends. Our panelists are going to tell you about what's new at prom this year. Pick the one who's telling the truth, you'll win our prize - the WAIT WAITer of your choice on your voicemail. You ready to play?
O'DONNELL: Absolutely.
SAGAL: All right. Let's hear first, then, from Negin Farsad.
FARSAD: The 1990s hip-hop duo Kris Kross made an unlikely resurgence at Boise, Idaho's Centennial High School. You might remember them from that one hit jump, jump. The Daddy Mac'll make you jump...
MAEVE HIGGINS: (Laughter).
FARSAD: ...Jump. Kris Kross will make you...
(LAUGHTER)
FARSAD: ...Jump, jump. The Daddy Mac'll make you jump, jump.
(LAUGHTER)
FARSAD: I'm sure it was a huge hit with NPR audiences. Anyway...
(LAUGHTER)
FARSAD: ...You may also remember the curious fact that they wore their pants backwards. The kids at Centennial High could not get enough of Kris Kross and started dressing backwards on campus. While there were a few awkward adjustments at the boys urinal, school administrators viewed the whole thing as a passing throwback fad. But the trend continued to grow. And the senior class decided to make the theme of prom backward. So they renamed it morp (ph), which is prom backwards...
(LAUGHTER)
FARSAD: ...For those of you who lack backward-speaking facility. Not only did the students decide to dress backwards - long dress trains flowing forward on girls and corsages pinned on boys' backs - but they made everything backward. Morp night started with the after party, where students got exceedingly drunk and made mistakes they would soon regret for the rest of their lives.
(LAUGHTER)
FARSAD: As they danced through the night, they turned their moonwalks forward and their flossing upward. Their twerking had more chest and less booty. And their Gangnam style looked like a horse was riding them.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: The backwards prom.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Where everything is backwards, including the progression of events in Boise. Your next promposal will come from Alonzo Bodden.
ALONZO BODDEN: Is your prom really chaperoned when the chaperone is Charlie Sheen?
(LAUGHTER)
BODDEN: You might have to figure that out, especially as the trend of celebrity prom chaperones is spreading and also because Mr. Sheen is looking for work.
(LAUGHTER)
BODDEN: TMZ reporter Selena Jones (ph) says it started at Calabasas High School in Southern California. Now, Calabasas is well known as the home of the Kardashian family. One parent called in a favor from her friend Kris Jenner. And the next thing you know, Khloe Kardashian is at the prom, checking kids for alcohol. Not to be outdone, ICM super agent Ian Arougheti has a friend whose daughter is at Beverly Hills High School of the Arts. So now their prom will be monitored by Idris Elba.
HIGGINS: (Laughter).
BODDEN: Interestingly, there may be more mom volunteers than actual students at that.
(LAUGHTER)
BODDEN: News travels fast and even faster on Snapchat. LA kids bragging got Nashville kids jealous. So their parents got into the act. And now country stars Carrie Underwood and Reba McEntire will be at the Nashville High School senior prom, making sure the kids don't do anything that they'll have to later write country songs about.
(LAUGHTER)
BODDEN: Not to be outdone, New York started rumors of Jay-Z at a Brooklyn high school. But these were unfounded. So Brooklyn Tech will have to settle for Chris Rock.
(LAUGHTER)
BODDEN: All of this led to the nightmare scenario possibly coming true. Charlie Sheen, through his lawyers, asked if chaperoning the LA performing arts high school prom would count as part of his community service.
(LAUGHTER)
BODDEN: TMZ is waiting for the judge's decision.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Celebrity chaperones is the new trend.
(APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: Your last story of what's new under the sea comes from Maeve Higgins.
HIGGINS: This year's big prom trend is inspired by a texting fail. Teens across the country texted their dates to check what kind of corsage they wanted, only to find that their phones autocorrected the word corsage to croissant.
(LAUGHTER)
HIGGINS: Croissant. Seems like a rose by any other name is a pastry. Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen, a Dallas bakery, is now selling the croissant corsage after the quirky autocorrect mistake blew up on social media. So instead of wearing delicate carnations and pretty lilies, youngsters are getting their prom dates' corsages made from actual croissants. It's a lovely way to make memory and a grease stain that will last forever.
(LAUGHTER)
HIGGINS: Surely, this is just a first in a long line of carbohydrate accoutrements from - why is there so many French words?
(LAUGHTER)
HIGGINS: Surely, this is a first in a long line of carbohydrate accessories from bagel buttonholes, cupcake cufflinks and, of course, a cumber sticky bun.
(LAUGHTER)
HIGGINS: It's all part of a lovely trend of having some fun and providing gluten-intolerant people with yet another activity they can't participate in.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: All right. Which of these...
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: ...Is a real prom theme or trend this year? Was it from Negin, the backwards prom or morp, in which everything happens backwards; from Alonzo, celebrity chaperones, a famous person standing there at the door for you or from Maeve Higgins, kids wearing croissants instead of corsages because of an autocorrect failure? Which of these is the real story of a prom trend?
O'DONNELL: Well, I think I'm going to go with the croissant corsage.
SAGAL: You're going to go with the croissant crosage (ph). I can't even say it - the croissant - croissant corsage.
HIGGINS: Croissant corsage.
SAGAL: All right. Well, to bring you the correct answer, we spoke to someone playing a role in the real story.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
JOHN FELTON: They would be asking a prom dates what kind of corsage they wanted. And autocorrect on their phone would change that text to croissant.
(APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: That was John Felton from Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen, which is making croissant corsages for this year's promgoers. Congratulations, Devin. You got it right.
(CHEERING, APPLAUSE)
O'DONNELL: Yeah. Thank you.
SAGAL: You earned a point for Maeve for her...
HIGGINS: Thanks, Devin.
SAGAL: ...Pronunciation of croissant.
HIGGINS: (Laughter).
SAGAL: And you've won our prize, the voice of your choice on your voicemail. Thank you so much for playing with us.
O'DONNELL: Thank you. This was amazing.

PETER SAGAL, HOST:
Panelists, now some questions about the rest of the week's news for you. Alonzo, a tourist getting a ride in a fighter jet in France got the full experience when the pilot accidentally did what?
ALONZO BODDEN: Ejected him.
SAGAL: Yes, that's what happened...
(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)
NEGIN FARSAD: What?
SAGAL: ...You know, the whole thing with the canopy blowing off and the seat rocketing into the air. Don't worry. He parachuted safely to the runway below. French authorities say he's fine. Or wait - French authorities actually said, quote, ""his health is not a cause for concern.""
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Weirdly, that's exactly what the same guy who rented the island had to say.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: The 64-year-old man was riding along in a French Air Force fighter jet, which isn't supposed to eject passengers just because it feels like it. It's not a nightclub. It's a fighter jet.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Most likely - nobody knows exactly what happened, but most likely, the passenger came close to fulfill his lifelong dream of having his last words be, what does this button do?
(LAUGHTER)
BODDEN: Peter, as someone who used to work on fighter planes, I think that's exactly what happened. I think he saw that red lever and said, I wonder what this does?
SAGAL: Yeah.
BODDEN: And then he found out.
SAGAL: Maybe this fires the guns...
BODDEN: (Laughter).
SAGAL: ...Or something cool.
BODDEN: But that is the ultimate - I mean, you know, it's great to get a ride in a fighter jet, but it has to kind of be cooler to even be ejected from a fighter jet.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: I know.
BODDEN: Imagine being at a party, and some guy's bragging that, yeah, man, I was riding in a fighter jet. Oh, you were only riding in one?
SAGAL: Oh, yeah.

Hi, you're on WAIT WAIT... DON'T TELL ME.
MEGAN DOHERTY: Hi Peter. This is Megan Doherty (ph) from Oberlin, Ohio.
SAGAL: Oberlin, Ohio, Megan, is home, of course, of Oberlin University.
(APPLAUSE)
DOHERTY: Oberlin College.
SAGAL: Oh, excuse me - Oberlin College. Do you have any affiliation with Oberlin College?
DOHERTY: I am a campus rabbi.
SAGAL: Oh, you are. So you work at the Hillel.
DOHERTY: I am.
SAGAL: Yeah.
DOHERTY: I do.
SAGAL: Yeah. And how...
DOHERTY: I do.
SAGAL: And how do you find that work?
DOHERTY: It's really fun.
SAGAL: The characters on Lena Dunham's show ""Girls"" were all Oberlin graduates. Was that true to life in terms of what they're like?
DOHERTY: I have never seen ""Girls.""
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Given your job, I wouldn't recommend it.
(LAUGHTER)
DOHERTY: Thank you.
SAGAL: Let me introduce you to our panel this week. First, the comedian and host of the podcast ""Fake The Nation."" It's just been nominated for a Webby Award for news and politics. It's Negin Farsad.

DOHERTY: Hello.
SAGAL: Next, a comedian you can see in Philadelphia at the Helium Comedy Club on April 18 through the 20, Alonzo Bodden.
ALONZO BODDEN: Hello.
(CHEERING)
SAGAL: And finally, a comedian whose new book ""Maeve In America"" is out now. It's Maeve Higgins.
MAEVE HIGGINS: Hi.
(CHEERING)
SAGAL: Megan, welcome to the show. You're going to play Who's Bill This Time. Bill Kurtis is going to read for you three quotations from this week's news. If you can correctly identify or explain two of them, you'll win our prize - any voice from our show you might choose on your voicemail. You ready to play?
DOHERTY: Yep.
SAGAL: Here we go. Here's your first quote.
KURTIS: From Congress, I would ask for wall. We need wall.
SAGAL: That was a quote from a woman who got fired last week - and despite doing her best to get wall for the president.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Who is it?
DOHERTY: Kirstjen unpronounceable last name...
SAGAL: Yes.
DOHERTY: ...Nielsen.
SAGAL: Kirstjen unpronounceable last name...
(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)
SAGAL: ...Nielsen, actually.
(CHEERING)
SAGAL: You can pronounce it. You just can't spell it. The now former secretary of homeland security is the latest victim of the president's cabinet separation policy.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: It's an everyone-must-go sale at the White House. The president...
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: ...Also got rid of the guy who was supposed to head up ICE, the acting director. He's out. He wanted someone who was, quote, ""tougher."" And he fired the head of the Secret Service right while the guy was diving in front of him, yelling, no.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: So now we have an acting secretary of defense, an acting homeland security secretary, an acting chief of staff and an acting head of the Secret Service. There are more actors in the president's cabinet...
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: ...Than there are in the wait staff of a Los Angeles restaurant.
(APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: You know what would be even better, though? An overacting secretary of defense.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: You realize, of course, this means war.
(LAUGHTER)
BODDEN: My favorite thing about Kirstjen Nielsen being the homeland security director, being anti-immigrant and everything else, is she spells Kirstjen with a J...
SAGAL: Yeah.
BODDEN: ...In the middle. Like, that's not American.
SAGAL: No, not at all.
(LAUGHTER)
BODDEN: Where you get that J from? What?
SAGAL: It's tough because, you know, you leave the Trump administration. You get fired. It's terrible. Your reputation is ruined. People yell at you wherever you go. And you know what the Trump administration's idea of COBRA benefits is to tie you into a sack with a cobra.
(LAUGHTER)
NEGIN FARSAD: But the thing about having all these acting secretaries...
SAGAL: Yeah.
FARSAD: ...Is that they're basically like temps. They're like substitute teachers.
SAGAL: Right.
FARSAD: Which means that our government is just a bunch of people doing whoopie cushion jokes and throwing spit wads at acting cabinet members. Like, it's chaos.
SAGAL: Yeah, that's true. Today at the Pentagon, they're just showing a movie.
FARSAD: Right, exactly.
(APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: All right, Megan. Your next quote is someone who is known for attacking millionaires and billionaires.
KURTIS: I wrote a bestselling book. If you write a bestselling book, you can be a millionaire, too.
SAGAL: That is the new Democratic front-runner according to polls. Who is it?
DOHERTY: That was Bernie Sanders.
SAGAL: It was Bernie Sanders.
(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)
SAGAL: Senator Sanders caused a bit of a stir this week because the guy who for years has been saying we've had enough of our country being run by millionaires and billionaires revealed that he is, in fact, a millionaire - which is surprising because most millionaires can afford haircuts.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: We should have known things were changing for him economically when his stump speech changed to (imitating Bernie Sanders) we've had enough of our country being run by billionaires and zillionaires.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: But Bernie has promised not to enjoy the money because in his entire life, he has never enjoyed anything.
(LAUGHTER)
HIGGINS: I just can't believe he got rich from writing a book because everybody I know who's written a book is so broke.
SAGAL: That's true.
(LAUGHTER)
FARSAD: And also, like, what can you buy in Vermont for a millionaire?
BODDEN: I think with a million dollars in Vermont, you can buy, like, half of Vermont.
SAGAL: It's true.
HIGGINS: Yeah.
SAGAL: By the way, this is all in preparation for Bernie releasing his tax returns. Did you know that Bernie has not released his tax returns? Didn't do it in 2016. He says he's going to do it next week. He's the perfect candidate for people who both hate President Trump and are kind of jealous of Republicans for having him. Why can't liberals have an angry, old man with terrible hair who won't release his tax returns?
(LAUGHTER)
BODDEN: I'm sitting here, Peter, trying to think of a joke that shows I care about rich, white men, but I've got nothing.
SAGAL: I know.
(LAUGHTER, CHEERING)
BODDEN: I've got...
FARSAD: It's tough.
BODDEN: I've got - listen. It's one more time...
FARSAD: I know.
BODDEN: ...White people complaining about, oh, man, I'd have made a million dollars. I don't know how to help you on that one.
SAGAL: Yeah, I know.
(LAUGHTER)
BODDEN: Good luck with that. Yeah.
SAGAL: Megan, here is your last quote.
KURTIS: Einstein must be totally chuffed.
SAGAL: That was a very happy astronomer quoted in The New York Times talking about the first-ever photograph ever made of a what?
DOHERTY: A black hole.
SAGAL: A black hole.
(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)
SAGAL: Yes.
(APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: This week, we got to look at the first-ever photo of an actual massive, interstellar black hole in a galaxy known as Messier 87 about 55 million light years away. It looks like a - well, a black hole surrounded by a ring of orange light like the eye of Sauron or a...
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: ...Really, really evil bagel.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Nonetheless, the photo was a scientific triumph. It was unlike anything anyone had ever seen - except for the people who asked for photos of their colonoscopies. Interestingly...
(LAUGHTER)
HIGGINS: Wait, is that what...
SAGAL: It made us think of that - all I can tell you.
FARSAD: How many colonoscopy...
BODDEN: Yeah.
FARSAD: ...Photos...
BODDEN: I guess.
FARSAD: ...Do you look at, Peter?
SAGAL: Well, you know.
FARSAD: (Laughter).
SAGAL: Interestingly - and this is pretty cool - because of the time it takes the light to get here - 55 million years - the photo is the black hole when it was much younger than it is now. So what do you know? The black hole is just like everyone on Tinder.
(LAUGHTER)
FARSAD: My first thought when I saw that photo was, like, wow, that's a really great use of portrait mode...
SAGAL: Yeah.
FARSAD: ...You know? So the...
BODDEN: That's why really - I really feel happy for those astrophysicists and the other science - the geniuses who spend their whole life studying and working, and they can finally say, that's what I do. This is what I do. Like...
SAGAL: Here you go.
BODDEN: People have always - what do you do at work?
(APPLAUSE)
BODDEN: This is what I do.
SAGAL: And this is really cool. It turns out that in order to take this picture of this extraordinarily distant object that there's no single telescope that's strong enough to do it. So they had to get data from telescopes all around the world and combine them in an incredibly complicated way figured out by a 29-year-old astrophysicist named Rachel (ph).
(CHEERING)
SAGAL: And they say that the precision of this virtual instrument they created was so precise they could see an orange on the moon - which makes you say, why are they going on about a black hole? There are oranges on the moon.
(LAUGHTER)
FARSAD: When I was reading about this, I read, like, if you were - they were trying to explain what happens if you go into the black hole.
SAGAL: Right.
FARSAD: And so you pass through the event horizon unscathed. And then you get to this point where the black hole stretches you like a noodle.
SAGAL: Yes.
FARSAD: Which, for a minute, I was, like, I'm OK with that as someone...
(LAUGHTER)
FARSAD: ...Who might use, like, body distortion filters on...
SAGAL: Yeah.
FARSAD: ...Insta...
SAGAL: Yeah.
FARSAD: ...That, like, you kind of go...
SAGAL: For a...
FARSAD: ...Like, your skinniest.
SAGAL: For an instant, a microsecond...
FARSAD: Yeah, for a microsecond...
SAGAL: You'll finally be a size one.
FARSAD: You're, like, super tall and skinny.
SAGAL: Yeah.
FARSAD: Exactly. That's kind of into that.
SAGAL: Yeah. That would be cool.
HIGGINS: But then do you just disintegrate?
FARSAD: And then you're dead.
HIGGINS: Worth it.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Bill, how did Megan do on our quiz?
KURTIS: She got them all right. She is a winner.
SAGAL: Megan, thank you so much for playing.
(APPLAUSE)
DOHERTY: Thank you.
SAGAL: Bye-bye.
DOHERTY: Goodbye.

Not My Job: We Quiz Journalist Dan Rather On What He Actually Said,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/13/712576151/not-my-job-we-quiz-journalist-dan-rather-on-what-he-actually-said?station=KXJZ_FM,"Enlarge this image Robin Marchant/Getty Images for AWXI Robin Marchant/Getty Images for AWXI We recorded the show in San Antonio, Texas, this week and invited journalist Dan Rather — Texas native and resident — to play our quiz. In addition to reporting on pretty much every major event of the last half century, Rather is also famous for ""Ratherisms"" — folksy sayings combining colorful metaphors with colorful wisdom. He's used so many of them, we're curious to see if he can pick out what he really said from the ones that we just made up.
Click the audio link above to hear how he does.
PETER SAGAL, HOST:
And now the game where people live a rich, full life and yet somehow end up with us.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: If all the major events of the late 20th century had a single thing in common, it might be this. They were reported on by Dan Rather. He was at Dealey Plaza...
(APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: ...When Kennedy was shot. He reported from Vietnam. He challenged Nixon on Watergate. He covered the Cold War and was there to cover its end. He is a proud Texas native and still a resident. We are honored to have him with us.
Dan Rather, welcome to WAIT WAIT... DON'T TELL ME.
DAN RATHER: Thank you very much.
(APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: So you still have a home here in Texas. You grew up here in Texas. You're a Texan.
RATHER: I was born in Wharton, Texas. I grew up in Houston, and I'm not just from Texas. I am of Texas.
SAGAL: You are a Texan.
(APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: You started - and it turns out that many reporters, including Bill, started this way. You were a local guy. You - at one - you were doing minor league baseball games at one point.
RATHER: I did. I once - I've always been interested in news. But once to supplement my income at its lower levels, you know, broadcasting doesn't pay all that well. So I did play-by-play as a way of supplementing my income. I did play-by-play football and baseball, basketball, track. Track is really difficult to do play-by-play from...
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: All right. Wait a minute. How would you do that? Well, he's running.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: He seems to be running more.
RATHER: Or he's vaulting, or he has this shot put in his hand. And he takes five steps, and he throws.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Do you think there's one moment that - in which you sort of got your start that started your career that we've all sort of been watching lo these many decades?
RATHER: Well, I do. That - there was a great hurricane in 1961, Hurricane Carla, which was at that time and I think still the largest in terms of sheer size hurricane on record in the Gulf of Mexico. And I had just started in television. I had made my move from radio into television. I was still new to television. And we wound up in the right place at the right time on Galveston Island as the hurricane came in. And that was picked up by other stations. Nobody else was there broadcasting. So if I had to point to one moment that sort of, quote, ""made my career,"" that was probably it.
SAGAL: Yeah, it's funny because Bill got his sort of start with a great tornado in Kansas.
BILL KURTIS: Tornado - same thing. You have to be there.
SAGAL: It turns out maybe these weather events are being caused by ambitious, young reporters.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: You were known and - for many things but certainly for being fearless, not only the places you went, like war zones, but also the way you treated people in power. There was a famous incident where you got up, and you asked President Nixon a question. It was during Watergate. And he didn't like it. And I believe he said, are you running for something? And your famous response was...
RATHER: No, sir, Mr. President. Are you?
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: That's pretty good. You, of course, took over as the anchor of the ""CBS Evening News,"" taking the baton from Walter Cronkite, another legend who, I guess, took it from Edward R. Murrow. So you're part of that line. And one of the things that people were noticing as you settled into that role was you were looking for your signoff because famously, of course, Cronkite would end his broadcast, well, that's the way it is on this day.
RATHER: Right.
SAGAL: And what was your thinking? You said, I needed something different? You needed something for yourself?
RATHER: Well, it was suggested to me that you need a signoff.
SAGAL: Yeah.
RATHER: But you know what? Following a legend like that is not the easiest thing in the world (laughter). At any rate, my first suggestion was maybe I can say, well, that's some of the way it is.
SAGAL: Yeah, OK. That's not bad.
(LAUGHTER)
RATHER: Nobody took to that idea. We tried to. But at any rate...
SAGAL: That's the way it might be.
(LAUGHTER)
RATHER: Doesn't have quite the same ring.
SAGAL: No, not at all.
RATHER: But at any rate, I was thinking, you know, my father's - late father's favorite word was courage for a lot of reasons. So I thought, well, maybe we could just pause and say, you know, and that's the ""CBS Evening News"" - Dan Rather reporting courage. And the more I thought about it, the more I kind of liked it because it had a nostalgic ring for me. I will say that the executives in the company were horrified that this whole...
SAGAL: Really.
(LAUGHTER)
RATHER: So it lasted about a week. And at the end of that week, it was pretty much you either stop using this as a signoff, or we stop using you.
SAGAL: Whoa.
RATHER: So it was an easy decision.
SAGAL: I understand. And what did you change to?
RATHER: I just decided not to have one.
SAGAL: Yeah, just went with the plain goodnight.
RATHER: I've giving it my best shot, didn't work out. So we...
SAGAL: There you go. I know. Hey, we could talk to you about your career all night, but out of all the people you've interviewed - and you interviewed just about every, you know, major historical player in the last 50 years - was there a particular favorite, somebody who you were glad to talk to?
RATHER: Well, I'm glad you put the preface because let's face it - I've been lucky and mightily blessed. I could give you the names maybe seven people. But if I had to pick one, it would be I was assigned - my first major assignment for CBS News was to cover Dr. Martin Luther King and what was then the emerging civil rights movement.
(APPLAUSE)
RATHER: Covering Dr. King changed me as a professional, and it changed me as a person. And for that reason, I would say if I had to pick one, I would say interviewing Dr. Martin Luther King and covering him day to day for almost two years.
SAGAL: Wow. Sure. I imagine that's - I'm envious that you had the chance.
(APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: Do you ever - when you're watching whomever, do you ever, like, miss it? Are you ever like, if I was there, I would have the questions?
RATHER: Like every second.
SAGAL: Yeah, I know.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: I can imagine. Well, Dan Rather, it is an absolute honor to talk to you, but today we have, in fact, asked you here to play a game we're calling...
KURTIS: This game is tougher than the hide of an armadillo in the hot sun that forgot its sunblock.
SAGAL: As I'm sure you know, you are famous for what people call Ratherisms, folksy sayings with colorful metaphors and colorful wisdom. You've used so many of them over your career. We want to see if you can pick the one you actually came up with....
(LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: ...From some fake ones that we made up in tribute to you. So if you can do that two times out of three, you'll win a prize for one of our listeners.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Bill, who is Dan Rather playing for?
KURTIS: Corey Henderstine (ph) of Washington, D.C.
SAGAL: All right. Here's your first Ratherism. This was when you were covering the 2000 election. And did you say, A, this race is tight like a too-small bathing suit in a too-long ride home from the beach...
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: ...B, Poppa, wear your good suit because we got ourselves a tie...
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: ...Or C, this race is tighter than Aunt Tilly after a third Moscow Mule.
(LAUGHTER)
RATHER: Definitely A.
SAGAL: It was definitely A.
(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)
SAGAL: I've always wondered before we move - did you just make those up off the top of your head? Or did you, like, have them ready to go?
RATHER: Well, in the beginning, they came from working in the oil fields when I was a kid. This is the way men talk with one another.
SAGAL: You have got to be kidding me.
(LAUGHTER)
RATHER: Oh, absolutely. You know, you can only say it's hot as hell so many times.
SAGAL: Yeah, I guess so. Yeah.
(LAUGHTER)
RATHER: So as the day wears on, you say, you know, it's hotter than a Laredo parking lot or some way to use colorful language.
SAGAL: All right. We have two more. You did well with that one. This is now - we're moving through time to the election of 2004. That was George W. Bush re-elected versus John Kerry. During that evening's coverage on CBS, did you say, A, John Kerry's wife might own Heinz, but this is one night he won't catch up...
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: ...B, we used to say if a frog had side pockets, he'd carry a handgun; or C, it all comes down to O-H-I-O, which stands for, oh, hi, it's over.
(LAUGHTER)
RATHER: Definitely B.
SAGAL: Yes, if a frog...
(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)
SAGAL: ...Had side pockets, he'd carry a handgun. I think you're doing really well.
(APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: Here's your last question. This is a great metaphor you used while commenting on the 2016 election. Was it, A, this race is a back country tilt-a-whirl - it could go either way; B, like the talking horse said to the hopping bull, I can't believe what I'm seeing...
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: ...Or C, if Clinton wins Florida, this race will go faster than a ""Hamilton"" ticket at face value.
RATHER: I don't recall saying any of those.
SAGAL: Really? Do you know which one you wish you had said?
(LAUGHTER)
RATHER: I guess that would be B.
SAGAL: You'd be B, like the talking horse said to the hopping bull. It is a good one, but the one that we were told you said if Clinton wins Florida, this race will go faster than a ""Hamilton"" ticket at face value, which I thought was great because you're updating your cultural references.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Meanwhile, Bill, how did your old friend Dan do on our quiz?
KURTIS: Well, he had won anyway. Two out of three is a big win for us.
(APPLAUSE)
KURTIS: Good going.
SAGAL: Dan Rather is a legend of broadcast news and the creator of News and Guts Media. The new season of ""The Big Interview With Dan Rather"" starts April 16 at 8 p.m. on AXS.
Dan Rather, thank you for being with us. Thank you.
(APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: Dan Rather, everyone.
RATHER: Thank you.
(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""(AIN’T THAT) GOOD NEWS"")
SAM COOKE: (Singing) Ain't that good news? Man, ain't that news? Baby's coming home tomorrow.
SAGAL: In just a minute, we finally settle that whole cat versus dog debate in our Listener Limerick Challenge. Call 1-888-WAIT-WAIT to join us on the air. We'll be back in a minute with more of WAIT WAIT... DON'T TELL ME from NPR.

Mueller Report: Wait Almost Over Fore Release Of Redacted Report : NPR,www.npr.org,Jessica Taylor,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/14/712914976/the-wait-is-almost-over-for-the-almost-full-mueller-report-to-be-released,"Enlarge this image Activists participate in a Release the Report rally in Times Square on April 4 in New York City. Drew Angerer/Getty Drew Angerer/Getty Images Activists participate in a Release the Report rally in Times Square on April 4 in New York City.
Drew Angerer/Getty Images Democrats in Congress and an overwhelming majority of the American public are eagerly awaiting the expected release this week of the Mueller report.
First came the wait for special counsel Robert Mueller to conclude his investigation on Russia's interference in the 2016 presidential election . That happened three weeks ago, but after Attorney General William Barr released a four-page summary of the nearly 400-page report, there has been a new anticipation — and growing acrimony — for the report to be released to members of Congress and the public. But even when the report is released, it's unlikely the politically divisive debate that has been the hallmark of President Trump's tenure in office will be resolved.
Politics READ: The Justice Department's Summary Of The Mueller Report Barr's summary letter on March 24, two days after Mueller delivered his report to the new attorney general, was met with glee from the White House, as he wrote that the lengthy investigation did not find that the Trump campaign ""conspired or coordinated with Russia in its efforts to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election.""
National Security Mueller Report Doesn't Find Russian Collusion, But Can't 'Exonerate' On Obstruction The president and most Republicans saw that rundown of Mueller's major findings as "" complete and total exoneration ,"" even though Mueller did not take a position on whether Trump obstructed justice , given his comments and actions around the ongoing investigation. Rather, Mueller's team wrote, according to Barr , that ""while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.""
Politics Democrats Demand Full Mueller Report, Lay Out Argument For Continued Investigations Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, however, concluded that Mueller's finding were ""not sufficient to establish that the President committed an obstruction-of-justice offense."" But given what little Democrats have seen of Mueller's findings, they want more answers on exactly how the Justice Department came to that conclusion. Barr said he would release more of the report but would need time to make the necessary redactions before it could be made public.
Politics House Judiciary Approves Subpoena For Full Mueller Report In Party-Line Vote Key House Democrats didn't want to wait and had initially demanded it be made public by April 2. But Barr responded , saying he thought he could complete any redactions by ""mid-April, if not sooner,"" and the release anticipated for this week does hit that promised timeline. However, soon after that update from Barr, the House Judiciary Committee, along a party-line vote, authorized a subpoena for the full report and its underlying investigative evidence. Barr has said he's willing to testify before the House and Senate judiciary committees in early May.
National Security Barr: Mueller Report Out Within 1 Week; IG Report On Russia Inquiry This Summer Barr was on Capitol Hill last week testifying before a panel of the House Appropriations Committee on unrelated budget matters, and he was clear that he didn't want to talk much about the Mueller report — but Democrats certainly did. The attorney general indicated that he would be open to negotiating with congressional leaders who want to see Mueller's underlying evidence once the report is released.
National Security Citing 'Spying' On Trump, Barr Says He Is Looking Into Origins Of Russia Inquiry Then, the next day, before a panel of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Barr stoked a whole new controversy when he said he'd launched his own informal inquiry into the origins of the FBI's initial counterintelligence investigation into Russia and the 2016 Trump campaign, which began the summer of that year at the height of the White House race. Trump has often pointed to this as evidence of bias, and Barr seemed to concur, saying that ""spying did occur"" on the then-nominee's campaign — a claim Trump has regularly made without evidence. Later in the hearing, Barr clarified that he has no ""specific evidence"" of such surveillance but that he has ""questions about it"" and ""concerns about various aspects of it.""
All of that suggests the controversy is likely to be far from over even when the redacted, lengthy Mueller report is released. Here are other lingering questions:

When Molly Hewitt left South Bend, Ind., for college, she didn't think she'd return to live there again. Since the 1960s, the city had suffered the same brain drain that plagued many other Midwestern cities faced with industrial decline.
""The goal was always to be successful enough that you don't have to come back to South Bend,"" she said.
But while she was away, things were turning around. Hewitt's parents kept her in the loop and she decided to give another chance to the city led by Democratic mayor Pete Buttigieg.
""I came back, honestly because of Pete and I've seen a lot of my friends do that and a lot of people who didn't grow up here that want to come to South Bend,"" she said. Now Hewitt is 23, living in South Bend and volunteering for the campaign of James Mueller , the candidate Buttigieg endorsed to replace him in this year's mayoral election.
Buttigieg, 37, officially announced his candidacy for the presidency on Sunday. On the campaign trail he speaks a lot about how being mayor of South Bend since 2012 has prepared him to be president.
""We transformed the trajectory of our city,"" Buttigieg said in an interview on Morning Edition in January. ""This is a community that was written off as dying at the beginning of this decade. Now it's growing again.""
South Bend's population is up more than 1,000 people since 2010 following decades of hemorrhaging tens of thousands of residents.
Investment in the city's downtown, public private partnerships, economic development — including turning the long vacant Studebaker auto plant , which closed its doors in 1963, into a tech hub — have been credited with the change.

Editor's note: This story contains language that some may find offensive.
A lawyer and her future son-in-law argue furiously about politics on Facebook, each accusing the other of ignoring ""the facts.""
A newly married couple gets into an uncomfortably heated argument as they watch the confirmation hearings of then-Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, until one finally leaves the room. ""I love you, but you're wrong,"" she says.
A Mexican-American college student argues with her Trump-supporting mother — also Mexican-American — about how she could possibly accept the idea of a border wall.
These, of course, are not isolated stories: Political differences can drive a wedge through even the closest families and friendships. A 2017 Reuters/Ipsos poll found that 13 percent of respondents said the 2016 election had caused them to end a relationship with a friend or relative. Nearly 40 percent said the election had provoked at least one argument with a loved one.
More broadly, Americans say they're worried that the United States is growing more polarized and that civility — respect, courtesy, kindness — is slipping away in many aspects of their lives. From road rage to Twitter feuds to the rancor at the highest levels of government, polls show that Americans think incivility is at crisis levels.
Recently, NPR has been traveling the country to explore how people are grappling with the idea of civility in polarizing times.
Here are five stories about the shaky line that people walk to keep things civil — or not — in their most intimate relationships. 'I Love You, But You're Wrong'
When Patricia ""P."" Price met Simone Perry in 2016, she was surprised when Simone told her she was Republican. As P. explains, ""Black, lesbian and Republican — it doesn't go in the same sentence."" They got married a year later, and Simone Perry became Simone Price. Loading...
Simone, who initially supported Ted Cruz and voted for Gary Johnson in 2016, says P. is more interested in ""how I carry myself and how I treat people than who I support politically."" P., a Democrat who voted for Hillary Clinton, says Simone is much more engaged in politics than she is and wins 90 percent of their political debates.
But several months ago, a debate flared into a fight that P. was not willing to concede. The confirmation hearings for Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court were on TV, and P. says she was ""completely turned off"" by his demeanor.
Simone, on the other hand, sympathized with Kavanaugh's need to defend himself. She remembers asking P., ""If someone we love is ever accused of something, are we going to grant them the benefit of the doubt?""
The argument got angry, uncomfortable. Both women say they often use prayer or meditation to calm themselves if they're fighting, but this political moment called for more immediate action: When P. felt she couldn't take it anymore, she walked out and went upstairs. The Fight Stays On Facebook
Christopher Kilpatrick and Cheryl Hume are about as politically different as two people can be. Chris, 38, describes himself as a ""far-right kind of guy"" who voted for Trump. Cheryl, his 58-year-old future mother-in-law, voted for Hillary Clinton and donates to causes like refugee resettlement and prisoner re-entry programs. They see each other only a few times a year but connect frequently on Facebook, where they clash overeverything from Trump's border wall to the latest conspiracy theory.

Their back-and-forth can get barbed — they sometimes attack each other for being ignorant — but before things get too nasty, one of them changes the subject. ""How's Kathy doing?"" Cheryl might ask.
Kathy is Chris' fiancée and Cheryl's foster daughter. Both Chris and Cheryl say it's their mutual love for Kathy that helps them put their political differences in perspective.
When the family gets together, Chris and Cheryl say, they avoid talking politics, partly to spare Kathy the misery of playing referee, but partly, they say, because they genuinely enjoy each other's company. Chris calls Cheryl ""big hearted,"" and Cheryl describes Chris as a ""good guy.""
But when they return home from a family gathering, Chris and Cheryl retreat to their respective corners on social media and resume sparring. Happily for them, Kathy doesn't pay that much attention to Facebook. Loading... The Reluctant Mediator
Lorraine Bank, 67, says she thinks her children were raised right and ""instilled with good values."" But somewhere along the way — through school, TV or the workplace — she thinks her two daughters ""got brainwashed."" Politically, the sisters lean liberal, while Lorraine is a staunch conservative. She says she and her husband mention Trump often enough so their children ""know we think he's a good president, but we don't rub it in.""
That's not always enough for daughter Valerie, 28, who voted for Clinton in 2016. She says she has to steel herself when she visits her parents.
""I do breathing exercises,"" she says. ""Before I get into a conversation, I give myself a pep talk and say, 'I'm going to keep calm, I'm not going to engage, and if someone tries to bait me, I'm not going to take the bait.' ""
Sometimes she has a few drinks to calm herself down. If all else fails, she leaves the room.
For the past few years, Valerie has had to deal with an additional family stress: Her older sister, Sarah, stopped talking to their mother after a serious fight. (Sarah declined to participate in this story.)
As their mother, Lorraine, tells it, after a series of political disagreements, she and Sarah got into a ""final straw"" argument about gay marriage shortly before the 2016 election.At one point, Lorraine referred to gay people as ""fags,"" and although she says she later apologized, Sarah still refuses to speak to her.
""I pray every day that whatever is wrong, she can get over it and she'll wake up and know we still love her,"" Lorraine says.
Now, on the few family occasions where everyone is together, Sarah won't interact directly with her mother. Valerie plays the reluctant mediator, trying to knit together a conversation between two people who can no longer find the words. Loading... From 'Oh Crap' To A Lasting Friendship
In 2016, Michael Beale and Francesco Mazza were assigned to be freshman roommates at High Point University in North Carolina. And before they met, they each formed an instant impression of the other.

Michael remembers that Francesco was wearing a bright red ""Make America Great Again"" hat in his Facebook profile photo.
""And I thought to myself, 'Oh crap, I gotta live with this kid for a year,' "" Michael says.
Francesco recalls that Michael's Facebook page had a picture of Bob Marley on it.
""So I'm like, 'Jesus, Mary and Joseph, he's probably like some hippie liberal,' "" Francesco recalls. (Michael actually voted for Libertarian Gary Johnson. And for the record, he doesn't remember a Bob Marley picture: ""It was probably me at a Grateful Dead concert,"" he says.)
Despite their respective knee-jerk reactions, both men decided to approach the year with open-mindedness — a trait that helped them avoid arguments and eventually build a friendship that has sustained to this day. Now 21-year-old juniors, the two recently returned from a spring break trip to Florida.
And almost since the day they met, they haven't been afraid to debate politics. 'Love Your Enemies' ... And Maaaybe You'll Get Them To Agree With You
""Michael will ask how I think Trump is doing,"" says Francesco. ""If I think he's doing something stupid, I'll say so.""
Francesco, the son of a police officer, grew up around guns in Norristown, Pa. Michael was raised in Connecticut near Sandy Hook Elementary School, where a devastating mass shooting made him wonder why anyone would own a gun.
Whenever there's a shooting in the news, they find themselves going back and forth about gun policy. Like many of their political debates, these conversations can be eye-opening — but rarely, they admit, mind changing. Loading... 'We Go Slowly, Trying Not To Hurt Each Other'
Nancy Richer, a 55-year-old Mexican-American, was born in Texas and spent half of her life in Mexico. Her daughter, Daniela Garduno, 19, was born in Mexico but grew up mostly north of the border. Each woman says she feels a stronger pull to one side of the Mexican-American hyphen: Nancy identifies more with her American side, Daniela with her Mexican side. Loading...
And that can cause tension. Daniela is against the border wall, while her mother supports it.
Nancy says she is proud of her older friends who went through the immigration process legally: ""They had to wait 18 years. They had to pay. They had to go through all the process,"" she says. ""Why not the others?""
Daniela says she's confused that her mother, a Trump supporter, ""can be Mexican and at the same time advocate for rights that are very anti-immigrant, anti-Latino."" She says she sometimes regrets that she and her mother aren't more politically aligned and can't have the relaxed, head-nodding conversations that some of her school friends have with their parents.
At the same time, both mother and daughter say they try to be respectful of each other's opinions, which helps keep their political arguments to a gentle roar.
""When I'm having these issues with my mom,"" Daniela says, ""I'll distance myself from the political part of it — I separate my mother from the politics.""
Of her daughter, Nancy says, ""When I see that she's responding as if I'm attacking her — instead of her points of view — that's when I stop. ... We go slowly, trying not to hurt each other."" Facebook"
Watch BTS Further Its Quest For World Domination On The 'SNL' Stage,www.npr.org,Stephen Thompson,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/sections/allsongs/2019/04/14/712797129/watch-bts-further-its-quest-for-world-domination-on-the-snl-stage,"YouTube A multilingual K-pop juggernaut, BTS mashes up pop, hip-hop, rock and dance music with huge, infectious energy and kinetic choreography. It's one of the biggest bands in the world, and as of this weekend, it's got a Saturday Night Live performance under its belt, too. The South Korean septet has built a fan base that's broad (its videos are viewed many hundreds of millions of times each), deep (its fans tend to be intensely devoted, especially on social media) and fully worldwide (its new record, Map of the Soul: Persona, is almost certain to top the U.S. album charts this week).
Every generation gets its own crop of boy bands, but BTS feels like an unusually potent force: Its sound seems to straddle the whole world, the songs are catchy as anything and each member brings enormous charisma to the mix. Lots of bands can seem strangely diminished by the SNL stage on TV, but on Saturday night, BTS filled every inch of the frame with flashy motion — tight choreography, bright colors, bold energy — as it performed ""Boy With Luv"" (from Map of the Soul: Persona ) and ""MIC Drop"" (first heard on 2017's Love Yourself: Her ).
YouTube That BTS has crossed over into the U.S. mainstream pop-cultural consciousness is no surprise; the group has been ascending for years amid a prolific burst of thematically ambitious albums and EPs. But this new surge feels like a genuine tipping point: The SNL appearance dominated social media all weekend, and BTS will drop another heavily hyped spectacle at the Billboard Music Awards on May 1. The group will team up with Halsey — a guest on the studio version of ""Boy With Luv"" — for the latter performance, the news of which broke during commercials Saturday night. Twitter was extremely excited, so strap in: SNL was just the beginning."

In the last couple decades, South Carolina has emerged as an important early state primary. NPR's Sacha Pfeiffer talks to Jaime Harrison, associate chairman of the Democratic National Committee.
SACHA PFEIFFER, HOST:
More Democrats have piled into the 2020 presidential race. Representative Eric Swalwell announced this past Monday. Cory Booker made it official yesterday. And Mayor Pete Buttigieg plans an announcement later today. Almost 20 people are scrambling for momentum in a crowded field. And while Iowa and New Hampshire have received outsized attention as the earliest presidential contests, South Carolina is a pivotal early state for candidates. It's the first state contest with a sizable African-American voting bloc. And black voters are expected to cast the majority of votes in the Democratic primary. It's early, but we asked Jaime Harrison, who's getting voters excited in South Carolina? He's exploring a run against Senator Lindsey Graham in 2020. And he's a former party chair and longtime Democratic politico.
JAIME HARRISON: Nobody has decided that they're married to anybody as of yet. And that's because the field is not set yet. You know, you got folks that are still out there, like Joe Biden, who has a long history in South Carolina. But right now there's a lot of energy for a lot of candidates. But I would say in particular right now there's a lot of buzz about Cory Booker - Senator Cory Booker, Senator Kamala Harris. And we're seeing growing buzz with Pete Buttigieg. And again, you know, as folks come into the state and start to build out their operations, I think we'll see a number of shifts over the course of the next few months.
PFEIFFER: What are the issues that you think will resonate most with South Carolina voters?
HARRISON: Well, the first thing is - and the issues part is a really, really important thing. You know, right now in South Carolina we are a state where the Republicans have refused to expand Medicaid, where 300,000 people could be covered by health care right now. And as a result, they're not. So health care is a big issue. Education is a big issue. The quality of schools - South Carolina, in our constitution, has that all that the state is obligated to provide is a minimally adequate education. That's what's in our constitution. And so therefore, you see these disparities in terms of education in rural communities and in communities of color. It's something that Jim Clyburn, who is the majority whip and our highest ranking Democrat in the state, and myself as a candidate for the United States Senate is - we're going to focus on, and we're going to ask the candidates to focus on as they come here to South Carolina as well.
PFEIFFER: Do you see generational differences mattering in this election, particularly in terms of what it would take to get younger voters to the polls?
HARRISON: Well, I do see some generational differences. And we saw those in the '16 cycle as well. You know, you take, for instance, the issue of the crime bill. That was a big issue between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. You know, crime during the '80s and '90s was just seen very differently, you know, by these young - by the younger generations now - millennials and younger - as opposed to older generations that were going through that period in time and saw all of the impact that drugs was having on their communities. And I think on those type of issues, there will be some generational differences. You even see it on the issue like reparations. You're seeing some generational differences in terms of how older African-Americans look at the issue and how younger generations of African-Americans are approaching the issue. But, you know, just based on who has voted in the past, we know that African-American women are the highest performing demographic not only in South Carolina but across the nation and will really play a dominant role in determining who the nominee is coming out of South Carolina.
PFEIFFER: Right now the frontrunner in polling is believed to be Bernie Sanders. This is an older candidate. This is a candidate who, obviously, has a big generational divide with younger voters. Anything in particular you think Sanders would need to do to appeal to black voters in South Carolina?
HARRISON: Listen. You know, Bernie Sanders has gone through this presidential primary before. And he understands what's at stake and what he has to do in order to appeal to folks that he wasn't able to convince the last time around. And I've seen some changes in terms of how he's addressing the issues. It's not just about economic inequalities but also addressing some of the racial disparities that come along with it. And that is a marked shift in the Bernie Sanders that I saw in 2016.
PFEIFFER: That's Jaime Harrison. He's associate chairman of the Democratic National Committee and former chairman of the South Carolina Democratic Party.
Jaime, thank you.

'Debatable' List Of '100 Most Jewish' Foods Leaves Plenty Of Room For Kibbitzing : The Salt : NPR,www.npr.org,Alana Newhouse,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2019/04/14/711014732/debatable-list-of-100-most-jewish-foods-leaves-plenty-of-room-for-kibbitzing,"Enlarge this image Challah, borscht and a bialy are among the items listed in The 100 Most Jewish Foods. Noah Fecks/The 100 Most Jewish Foods Noah Fecks/The 100 Most Jewish Foods Challah, borscht and a bialy are among the items listed in The 100 Most Jewish Foods.
Noah Fecks/The 100 Most Jewish Foods It's hard to talk about Jewish culture without talking about food. The bagels, the brisket, the babka. Oh, the babka.
Ask anyone who is spending this weekend filling their freezer with matzo balls for the upcoming Passover Seder, and they'll tell you that food is intertwined with Jewish culture and history — to the point,where it can become a theology in and of itself, the stage on which all sorts of Jewish values are performed. It's not surprising to learn that the code of Jewish law is called the Shulchan Aruch — the set table. And that the commentary on the book is the Mappah — the tablecloth. But that said, what exactly does it mean for a food to be Jewish ?
Alana Newhouse, editor of Tablet Magazine , the online journal which brands itself as a new read on Jewish life, attempts to answer this question (or operate from the place of having answered it) with a newly published book, The 100 Most Jewish Foods: A Highly Debatable List . In a series of short essays, contributors wax on about dishes from Mitteleuropa to the Middle East, probing through lines of history and sentiment (and making a collective case as to why the latter may be more important than the former).
From the outset (well, actually from the subtitle), Newhouse acknowledges this is loaded territory.
""This is not a list of today's most popular Jewish foods, or someone's idea of the tastiest, or even the most enduring,"" Newhouse lays out in the introduction. ""What's here, instead, are the foods that contain the deepest Jewish significance — the ones that, throughout the history of our people (however you date it), have been most profoundly inspired by the rhythms of the Jewish calendar and the contingencies of the Jewish experience.""
Significance and profound inspiration can of course be in the eye (or stomach) of the beholder. But the list is admirable. Sure, we could quibble with some of the choices (say, omitting Crisco's fine Jewish history ). But the book details what are clearly the greatest hits: the deli stalwarts, the Israeli favorites, the convenience foods that targeted the kosher market and became ingrained in diaspora tradition. Or, as Newhouse puts it, ""the salty, the sweet, the dense, the light, the beautiful, and the undeniably brown, stretching back over thousands of years of civilization and from nearly every region of the planet.""
But for those looking for a full picture of the histories and resonances of the particular foods that made the list — well, they may be somewhat disappointed.
This book grew out of an online project, and often it shows. Like a lot of quick turnaround writing of the Internet age, many pieces in this book are lightly sourced, and some more about clever constructions (that, say, some of the top bagel joints aren't run by Jews) than deeper-level history and fact (many of them still are, also: *Talmudic shrug*).

Amazon Independent Booksellers Zac Posen's article on borscht simply tells you that it is pink, and he developed a recipe for it, and life has sweet and sour moments. ( Lea Zeltserman thankfully comes in with a beautiful meditation on how this food, which defines Russian-Jewish cuisine, actually fits into the stories and tables of those Jews who lived through the Soviet era). And fine fish chef Eric Ripert weighs in on gefilte fish, just to ultimately tell you that it is ... not that bad?
More troubling are the entries that not only sidestep the rich stories of how particular foods became ""Jewish,"" but consciously disregard these histories in a deliberate attempt to nationalize them. Writer Liel Leibovitz urges readers to ""Forget the heated arguments about [hummus'] true national origins,"" because all you need to know is that it's the official dip of the NFL. And his entry for shakshuka shrugs, ""So what if the Moroccans make it, too. Never mind that the Tunisians eat it for breakfast each weekend, or that it delights the Greeks and satiates the Algerians: Shakshuka is Israeli now."" These are clearly attempts to be cheeky (humor being a fine Jewish value), but the glib gloss on appropriation can be difficult to stomach. As is editor Alana Newhouse's essay joking that terrible store-bought cookies served at temple are more of a threat to American Judaism than the BDS movement calling for an economic boycott to force Israel to recognize Palestinian statehood.
That said, there are some beautiful meditations on food and family and feeling within these pages. Barbara Kirshenblatt-Gimblett writes an homage to everything that could be made from the whole chickens her mother and grandmother would get from the kosher butcher. The feet ended up enriching soup (after careful cleaning and prepping); the neck bones would add flavor and bits of meat to the broth; the neck skin would be stuffed with filling and sewn up with white cotton thread. The bird itself would be roasted to golden-crisp perfection, while the eyerlekh , the unhatched chicken eggs found inside freshly slaughtered chickens, would be floated in soup. (Because of salmonella-testing regulations, they aren't easily found anymore.)
There are stories of beloved grandmothers, of the wealth of Yiddish words for dill, and of the surprising role of sugar cereals in Orthodox homes. (They're a Sabbath morning treat, when religious prohibitions on work mean adherents can't cook the usual hot breakfast.) Leah Koenig (who provides context and commentary throughout the book) explains how after the destruction of the temple, religious rites were transferred to the Sabbath table, making breads like challah akin to a divine offering. And MaNishtana reflects on the special resonances of a Seder meal — and the mortar of charoset in particular — for African American Jews, for whom the legacy of slavery is lived on a daily basis.
There are also the personal recollections that are downright hilarious — like Josh Malina 's story of his grandmother's gribenes (chicken skin cracklings), and his own adoption thereof. (""For an elegant vegetarian version, simply don't eat anything at all."") And Wayne Hoffman serves up a pitch-perfect ode to the (shared) used tea bag on his parents' kitchen counter.
The book comes with 60 recipes, but that's almost beside the point. (And who can agree on the definitive version anyways?) This is about how food is tied up in sentiment, and the role it can play in life. These are the stories of snacks people ate when they came home from school, memories from the holiday table, treats from the sorts of bakeries that don't exist anymore. Its very existence is an engagement in the fine Jewish tradition of debate, and there is clearly room for the arguments to continue. But The 100 Most Jewish Foods is also a love letter — to food, family, faith and identity, and the deliciously tangled way they come together."

Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous state, is led by a Hindu priest and has banned the consumption of beef and changed some city names to reflect Hindu heritage.
Altaf Qadri/AP Indian elections are often called the world's largest exercise in democracy. This month, nearly 900 million voters are eligible to cast ballots in national elections that started Thursday and will continue for more than five weeks.
They are deciding whether or not to re-elect Prime Minister Narendra Modi and members of his ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, or BJP.
Their votes will also make clear the country's level of support for a growing trend in India's politics: Hindu nationalism.
""The shape of India is at stake,"" says Milan Vaishnav, who directs the South Asia Program at the Carnegie Endowment in Washington, D.C. ""One of the important things this election is going to determine is India's future as a secular republic that embraces pluralism and adheres to the founders' notion that India's unity is strengthened by its diversity.""
Asia Polls Open In The World's Largest Democracy: Fun Facts On India's Election Modi's record has been mixed: In his five years in office, India's economy has grown robustly , but unemployment has also risen to a 40-year high. There was an outbreak of violence this winter, when India exchanged airstrikes with its arch-rival and nuclear-armed neighbor, Pakistan.
There has also been an elevation of Hindu-centric policy and discourse. Supporters call it Hindu pride, or Hindutva — Hindu-ness, the feeling of being Hindu. Others call it Hindu nationalism, an ideology of Hindu hegemony — and a danger to the republic.

Altaf Qadri/AP While Hinduism is India's majority religion ( almost 80 percent of Indians are Hindu), Hindu nationalism is political. It's the idea that Hindu faith and culture should help shape the state and its policies — and it negates the contributions of others.
Hindu nationalism has roots in the 19th century, when it emerged as a backlash to the ideas of liberal Hindu reformers, British and Portuguese colonialism and Christian missionaries. It has gained prominence in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, especially under Modi and his Hindu nationalist BJP.
But it's often at odds with the secularism enshrined in India's constitution. Many see this election as a turning point in which India may decide to redefine itself according to its majority Hindu faith.
Beef bans, politician-monks, new names
The last five years under Modi have seen shifts, both gradual and not, as Hindu nationalists have grown increasingly assertive, inserting their priorities into Indian policy, laws and daily life.
Minority groups are shunted out or subordinated. As long as the majority is in the ascendency, it doesn't really matter what the conditions for minorities are.
Historian Romila Thapa
The ideology of a Hindu nationalist group called the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) — where Modi spent his formative years — has become especially prominent in recent years. The RSS is an all-male Hindu volunteer corps that says it aims to promote Hinduism in civic life. But its critics accuse it of stirring hatred and violence toward India's minorities.
One RSS priority that has become law in several Indian states in recent years is a ban on cow slaughter and the consumption or sale of beef. Hindus consider cows sacred. Police enforce the bans, punishable with up to 10 years in jail in some states or municipal fines in others.

The Congress party dominated Indian politics for much of the country's history but has been overshadowed in recent years by the Hindu nationalist BJP.
Rajesh Kumar Singh/AP But self-appointed cow vigilantes — laypeople, sometimes affiliated with the RSS or BJP — have also taken it upon themselves to investigate and sometimes attack and even kill people suspected of dealing in beef on the black market.
The victims are often Muslims or lower-caste Hindus who traditionally consume and trade in beef and have been deprived of their livelihoods due to the new laws. There's been a rash of mob lynchings targeting those minorities in recent years. Between May 2015 and December 2018, at least 44 people — 36 of them Muslim — were killed in cow vigilante violence across 12 Indian states, according to Human Rights Watch . Hundreds more have been injured.
Meanwhile, Hindu monks and priests have risen to power in politics and business. Baba Ramdev, a monk and yoga guru with close ties to Modi, runs of one of the fastest-growing consumer goods empires in India, selling food, cosmetics and medicine based on ancient Hindu healing traditions.
The chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous state, with more than 200 million residents, is a Hindu priest. Yogi Adityanath is a prominent member of Modi's party and a vocal Hindu nationalist, infamous for anti-Muslim rhetoric. His state government has enacted a beef ban and renamed cities and landmarks that previously had names rooted in Islam.
For example, the city of Allahabad, built in the 16th century by Muslim rulers of the Mughal Empire, was officially renamed last year as Prayagraj, a word that references an earlier Hindu settlement and pilgrimage site there.
Hindu nationalists argue that for centuries, British and Mughal dominance influenced how they view their own history — and they're now finally reinterpreting it through authentic Hindu eyes.

Bernat Armangue/AP ""India was subjugated under those Muslim rulers. People feel there was some injustice, and history has not been presented and narrated and understood in the way that it should have been understood,"" says Yogeshwar Tewari, head of the history department at Allahabad University (whose name remains unchanged for now). ""Every nation goes through course correction.""
The extent of what Tewari calls ""subjugation"" of Hindus is a question that has divided historians. But for many Indian Hindus, Muslim place names are like Confederate statues in the American South — reminders of a painful history, some of which are now being removed. During parts of the Mughal era, some Hindu temples were desecrated or destroyed, and for a time, a tax was levied on non-Muslims.
Others see the name changes as a dangerous process of erasing the history of an era in which the Mughals united India's disparate kingdoms, codified human rights and left behind some of the country's best-known architecture, including the Taj Mahal.
Today, more than 180 million Muslims make up nearly one-sixth of India's population, a bigger proportion of India than African-Americans are in the U.S.
""What is very clear from the kinds of alliances being made for the elections is that the purpose is to consolidate the Hindu vote,"" says historian Romila Thapar, professor emerita at Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi. ""Minority groups are shunted out or subordinated. As long as the majority is in the ascendency, it doesn't really matter what the conditions for minorities are. Fifty years ago, 70 years ago, everyone was equal. Today, it's majoritarianism.""
Shrinking space for secularism
That sense of Hindu primacy is squeezing other voices out, Thapar warns.
""As rationalists, we are dismissed because we are told, 'You're not people of faith. You don't understand,'"" she says. ""Now the question is, is politics going to be run by people of faith?""
In 1947, when India won its freedom from British colonial rule, the territory was partitioned into a new Muslim state — Pakistan — and a secular, pluralistic state, India.
At the time, India's founding fathers — including the freedom fighter Mohandas Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru, who became the country's first prime minister — concluded that only a pluralistic democracy could hold together India's myriad ethnic groups, languages and castes.
Hindu nationalists were outraged. They had lobbied unsuccessfully for a Hindu state, with laws to be shaped by Hindu scripture. They accused Gandhi and Nehru of appeasing minorities by treating them as equals to Hindus under the law. Months later, a Hindu nationalist assassinated Gandhi.
Gandhi's death silenced any debate over his and Nehru's vision for a secular India. The RSS, to which Gandhi's assassin belonged, was banned after the murder — the first of three RSS bans, though all have been overturned and the group remains legal today. Nehru's daughter Indira Gandhi and grandson Rajiv Gandhi went on to become elected prime ministers of India with the Congress party, which has dominated Indian politics for most of the post-independence era.
India voted the Hindu nationalist BJP into power briefly in 1996, and then again in 1998 and 2014. If Modi is reelected this spring and serves another full five-year term, his would be the longest streak of non-Congress party rule in modern Indian history.
These days, even major secular political parties like the Congress party don't talk about secularism anymore, says Vaishnav.
""One of the most remarkable things about the 2019 election is how little opposition politicians are talking about secularism. It's a four-letter word,"" he says. ""That's something that BJP and its Hindu nationalist allies have succeeded in bringing about.""
The question now is whether Indians voting over the next five weeks will endorse that vision for their country.

Hollywood Writers Vs. Agents : NPR,www.npr.org,,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/14/713195758/hollywood-writers-vs-agents,"NPR's Sacha Pfeiffer talks to writer and producer Keli Goff about members of the Writers Guild of America being told to fire their agents en masse.
SACHA PFEIFFER, HOST:
A Hollywood labor dispute got ugly this weekend between writers and their agents. The Writers Guild of America, the union that represents Hollywood writers, told them to fire their agents after negotiations between the two sides broke down Friday night. The fight is over packaging deals. That's where actors, directors and writers are bundled together for a fee. Keli Goff is a member of the Writers Guild. She's a writer and producer of the Netflix documentary ""Reversing Roe."" And I asked her why she thinks packaging disadvantages writers.
KELI GOFF: So, for instance, I'll give you an easy example. You're a writer. You go into negotiations on a project. And you say, you know, actually, they should be paying me more based on my experience, based on the fact that I'm a woman, for instance, and that I know they've paid male screenwriters a lot more previously for similar projects. If your agent has an interest as a producer on a project then their interest has to be to keep the costs low for the production. So they are not going to be inclined to hear ethical or other reasons for why you should be compensated more fairly. And there's a lot more profit for agencies to make as content creators and as our bosses than as those defending our interests against our bosses.
PFEIFFER: Could agents just be cut out of the process entirely? And could a manager or a lawyer be negotiating these deals for you?
GOFF: That's a great question, Sacha. And I think we're about to find out. So what I found from my friend whose sole income comes from screenwriting is there is such a culture of fear in Hollywood. I can speak out about this because I have other lines of income. For my friends who've only worked as screenwriters, many of them have told me their agents didn't get them their first job, their second job, their third job. And they really only stay signed with an agency because they're terrified of not saying they're with one. There's a fear that if you're a woman and a person of color, in particular, that if you talk openly about having bad experiences with agents, you will be deemed difficult, which we know that that's a word that tends to haunt women and people of color more than others. And now because we have been forced to fire them as part of our union membership, people now are going to go for possibly a month or three months without agents. And I think people are going to be in for a rude awakening. If people go for a few months without their agents and their careers actually go along just fine, I think a lot of people are going to have a tough sell being convinced to go back to relinquishing that 10 percent or more for someone who isn't actually pulling their weight.
PFEIFFER: But I remember, after the last major writers' strike, it's often attributed to helping give rise to reality television because Hollywood said, you don't want to write? Fine. We don't need writers. We'll just do reality TV. Any risk that there's now such a demand for content from Netflix and Amazon and other providers that you guys are going to be more easily replaceable than you realize?
GOFF: Well, I think, in this case, though, the agents are the ones that are actually replaceable. You know, when push comes to shove, even though reality television rose up during the last writers' strike, keep in mind, once writers came back, it gave rise to the golden age of Hollywood. What did we get? - ""Game of Thrones,"" ""Mad Men."" What ended up happening is people realized, actually, you need writers to create content. It's just if the content's not going to be on CBS or ABC and other places that came up with ""Survivor"" or ""The Bachelor"" when we went on strike, then it gave rise to other mediums like Netflix.
PFEIFFER: You clearly feel very strongly about your position. But how much of a consensus issue do you think this is among writers?
GOFF: Well, I have noticed that there is total consensus pretty much among every writer I've ever talked to that the way agencies do business does not benefit the overwhelming majority of writers. There seems to be a consensus on that. And we also know that the - what I would say, as someone who, again, is relatively new to the business, is that, in general, I think there is less tolerance for the culture of fear that has run Hollywood all these years. I would say that the same thing that gave us Harvey Weinstein and Les Moonves is what we're talking about right now, which is powerful people getting away with unethical and bullying behavior and, essentially, assuming that people are either so scared and desperate that they will put up with it. If you look at something like Weinstein, that kind of behavior can only go unchecked when you have people who are willing to enable. There should have been agents who were looking out for those actresses in those situations. But what happened in most situations - you had the agents who were willing to defend the power structure. And that's, essentially, what we're talking about here is we need something that checks the people in power from engaging in bad behavior. And those checks and balances are disappearing with packaging. And that's simply all we're trying to take a stand for.
PFEIFFER: Keli Goff is a television writer and producer. She fired her agent about a day ago. Keli, thank you.
GOFF: Thank you.

How The Rock 'N Play Baby Sleeper Became Popular And Why It Was Recalled : NPR,www.npr.org,,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/14/713195723/how-the-rock-n-play-baby-sleeper-became-popular-and-why-it-was-recalled,"How The Rock 'N Play Baby Sleeper Became Popular And Why It Was Recalled How The Rock 'N Play Baby Sleeper Became Popular And Why It Was Recalled Embed Embed
NPR's Sacha Pfeiffer talks with baby sleep consultant and author Alexis Dubief about the recall of Fisher-Price's Rock 'n Play sleepers, which have had a devoted following among parents.
SACHA PFEIFFER, HOST:
Fisher-Price has officially recalled 4.7 million Rock 'n Play sleepers, which have had a devoted following among parents of newborns. The Rock 'n Play is a portable sleeper that props a baby up at a slight incline. But last week, the American Academy of Pediatrics called the product deadly. In about the last eight years, 32 babies have died while sleeping in Rock 'n Plays - most because they couldn't breathe after rolling over while they weren't buckled in. Alexis Dubief is a baby sleep consultant and runs a Facebook group called Precious Little Sleep. She joins me now.
And welcome, Alexis, despite the grim topic.
ALEXIS DUBIEF: Thank you for having me.
PFEIFFER: For people who haven't seen one of these, could you explain in more detail what a Rock 'n Play is and does and why it's been so popular?
DUBIEF: So the reason why it's so popular is that it's a fairly inexpensive, small, sort of snuggly sleep option for infants. But they are not a flat surface. So the baby is sort of cradled in this mesh material. Newborns do not sleep well. They have a poorly regulated system. And so they need a lot of assistance to fall asleep and stay asleep. And babies do tend to sleep fairly well in them.
PFEIFFER: So in some ways, it sounds like the Rock 'n Play has been a godsend for a lot of parents. But what are the conditions that make it dangerous?
DUBIEF: What we know from the recall is very little. Thirty-two deaths in almost 10 years is concerning. And I am very concerned. And I respect the American Academy of Pediatrics. So, of course, we've said stop using the Rock 'n Play. But we also know that infants die on all sleep surfaces. So what we really are trying to understand - and what I would love to understand better - is, what is the relative risk of the Rock 'n Play compared to the crib or, what often is the fallback position, co-sleeping with an adult?
PFEIFFER: What are the other impacts of this recall for parents who had relied on this product?
DUBIEF: Well, I think the big impact is going to be just sleeplessness and possibly an increase in co-sleeping. I think there's a lot of stress because for many parents, they understand that sleep in the crib is the gold standard for safety. They understand that. These are not parents who are uninformed. But they're also miserably sleep deprived. The reality is people suffer seriously from sleep deprivation. What happens is we fall back into kind of desperation-based, unsafe behaviors. It's not a logical decision. It's a desperation decision. And that's where we end up co-sleeping - in many cases, co-sleeping on a couch or a chair, which is something that we know is, you know, associated with a 12x increase in the risk of SIDS. Highly risky situations occur when we're desperately sleep deprived and it's 2, 3, 4 in the morning and we've been up every 45, 60, you know, minutes for the entire evening.
PFEIFFER: I'm wondering if this recall has a disproportionate effect on parents who earn less because the Rock 'n Play, at the lower end, was relatively affordable. If you're going back to work in about two weeks or so after giving birth, which you might do if you don't have maternity leave or paternity leave, then you're even more tired. Do you feel like there's an income inequality aspect to this?
DUBIEF: Yes (laughter). Yes. A lot of the sort of things we use to help babies sleep better cost money - you know, swaddling blankets, fancy cribs. The Rock 'n Play was a relatively inexpensive and effective - in terms of helping children sleep better - tool to be used for a few months after birth that probably helped a lot of people who maybe couldn't afford other options. So absolutely, there's a huge amount of privilege in having the resources to get access to postpartum doulas and night nurses and have a spouse who has a job that would get them paid leave so they can help out at night.
PFEIFFER: In general, what kind of reaction are you hearing from the parents you know, your clients? Are people in a lot of distress about this?
DUBIEF: I think people are very distressed about this because it never feels good to feel that you might have unintentionally put your child at risk. I think, also, a lot of people in the group are reasonably looking at the Rock 'n Play and saying, if this product is recalled, then all infant swings and similar devices should also be recalled and are expecting for that to happen. I would love to see more research and insights from the AAP about the relative risk of various sleep options because simply telling people that the crib is the only option for your child in practicality is not a reasonable response.
PFEIFFER: Alexis Dubief is the author of ""Precious Little Sleep."" And she runs a Facebook group by the same name.
Thanks for talking with us.

'Fifty Things That Aren't My Fault': Essays By Cartoonist Cathy Guisewite : NPR,www.npr.org,Cathy Guisewite,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/14/712791381/after-decades-of-comics-cathy-cartoonist-found-writing-so-liberating,"Fifty Things That Aren't My Fault Essays from the Grown-Up Years
by Cathy Guisewite
Hardcover, 323 Fifty Things That Aren't My Fault Subtitle Essays from the Grown-Up Years Author Cathy Guisewite Cathy Guisewite, the creator of the ""Cathy"" comic strip, didn't really want the character to be named after her. People would think that ""Cathy"" was based on her own life, she reasoned, and ... they would be right. Or, at least, they wouldn't be wrong.
""Cathy was kind of my heart,"" Guisewite says. ""Other stronger characters in the strip like Andrea were more my brain. But Cathy was kind of my heart, that was me.""
When ""Cathy"" hit the newspapers in 1976, it struck a chord with a lot of women. Fans identified with her self-deprecating humor and her relentless insecurity about her looks and love life. Detractors railed against the strip for reinforcing stereotypes of women.
Now, more than 40 years after Cathy's debut, Guisewite has published a book of essays called Fifty Things that Aren't My Fault . And in it, she responds to some of Cathy's critics.
""Some people thought my work reinforced the negative stereotype of women being obsessed with shopping, weight and love,"" she writes. ""But it wasn't my fault we still live in a world that partly judges women by what we wear, how much we weigh, and whether or not and who or how we love. Not my fault that with every glorious new possibility for women came an extra sense of isolation when we not only couldn't keep up but were told we shouldn't talk about the things that held us back.""
By her mid 20s, Guisewite had a successful career in advertising. She was eager to take advantage of all the new opportunities that were opening up for women. But being single and independent had its drawbacks. She felt caught between what she calls ""the two Bettys"" — the 1950s icon of the ideal homemaker Betty Crocker, and the new, vibrant, feminist voice of Betty Friedan. She wanted what both had to offer.

Nick Ut/AP ""I wanted a career,"" Guisewite says. ""I wanted my independence. I wanted to put off marriage and children, and have my own success. But I also really wanted a boyfriend. You know? I was in my mid 20s. I wanted someone to love me.""
Guisewite found humor in her own insecurities and an outlet for them in the comic strip. (For all the jokes Guisewite made over the years about her character's obsession with food and weight, she herself is tiny.) Clearly she was not alone in feeling unsure of her footing in the new world that had been opened by feminism.
Guisewite retired the comic strip in 2010 when she needed more time for her aging parents and her teenage daughter. As she commuted between the two, she began jotting down her thoughts, which is how the book got started.
When I started writing these essays, it was like coming home and taking off the Spanx. This was so liberating.
Cathy Guisewite
""When I started writing these essays, it was like coming home and taking off the Spanx,"" she says. ""This was so liberating. I loved getting to write longer and more thoughtfully about a lot of the same things I wrote about in the strip.""
Guisewite still uses humor to sift through her feelings and she still obsesses over food, and clothes, and the people she loves. But she hopes she's gained some wisdom over the years that she can share with very different generation of women.
Young women lined up recently to meet Guisewite after a book event at The Wing — a communal workspace and social club for women — in New York's SoHo neighborhood. This generation has inherited the feminism that was brand new when Guisewite was young. And Guisewite fan Stephanie Roman says they are still grappling with some of the same issues.
""I'm a body image coach, so the whole theme about food, and dieting, and trying to accept ourselves, and willpower and lack of willpower — whatever it might be — is still definitely a big thread in my life,"" Roman says.
A lot of these women remember reading the ""Cathy"" comic strip as kids. Jessica Schwartz sports a Cathy button that reads: ""I don't have time for this mid-life crisis.""
""Cathy was such a real-seeming woman,"" Schwartz explains. ""I mean, screaming, and pulling her hair out, and freaking out about tiny things — literally the most relatable comic figure ever.""
As Schwartz approaches Guisewite, she pulls something out of her bag ... it's a cake pan, in the shape of Cathy's face . ""Oh my God, you have the cake pan,"" Guisewite says, recognizing the merch. Schwartz shows Guisewite photos of the Cathy cakes (and a meatloaf) she's made over the years.
As Guisewite takes in the array of desserts made in Cathy's image, it's clear she's delighted her character means so much to these young women. Guisewite hopes this new book will feel like a friend ... the kind who knows exactly what to say when you need some reassurance.
As for Guisewite's advice to this new generation of women? Never lose your sense of humor."
U.N. Envoy To Libya On Situation On The Ground,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/14/713195744/u-n-envoy-to-libya-on-situation-on-the-ground,"As fighting continues outside Libya's capital, NPR's Sacha Pfeiffer speaks with Ghassan Salamé, U.N. envoy to Libya about what the international community is doing to negotiate a ceasefire.
SACHA PFEIFFER, HOST:
Fighting continues in Libya as different groups battle for control of the country's capital. In the last week alone, thousands of people there have been forced from their homes. And the U.N. estimates that at least 75 people have died and hundreds have been wounded. Ghassan Salame is the U.N. envoy to Libya and joins me from Tripoli.
Good morning.
GHASSAN SALAME: Good morning.
PFEIFFER: Could you tell us what are you seeing there in terms of what kind of fighting and what kind of impact on civilians?
SALAME: Unfortunately, we have seen a few violations of international humanitarian law. A school was hit yesterday in an area called Ain Sara. And already, eight ambulances have been hit since the beginning of the conflict. So we had, today, to remind everybody that these are serious violations of international law and that we are documenting them.
PFEIFFER: The general behind this attack has the support of countries, including not just Egypt and the United Arab Emirates but a Western country, France. How does that complicate the situation?
SALAME: The past week has been quite clear for that. I mean, when you have divisions in the international community, it shows immediately. And it has a very negative effect on the ground.
PFEIFFER: And didn't France block an effort by the EU to issue a statement condemning the general?
SALAME: France was not on the same line like the other members. And in the Security Council, it was Russia who also was not happy with the draft for a presidential statement of the Security Council.
PFEIFFER: And so what does that leave your options as? In terms of what the U.N. can do to try to broker peace, what do you feel like is left for you to do?
SALAME: On the political level, we are trying to bring the two sides to agree on a ceasefire. However, both sides are putting conditions for this ceasefire. The government in Tripoli wants, as a precondition, a retreat via Mr. Haftar's forces while Mr. Haftar doesn't accept this condition.
PFEIFFER: Do you think that Haftar's troops are getting support from other countries in terms of money and/or equipment and arms?
SALAME: Everybody's getting support from outside, including Mr. Haftar, of course.
PFEIFFER: About a year ago, you had said that it was extremely difficult getting consensus and even trying to figure out what would the roadmap forward be. Did you see this coming?
SALAME: Well, we have been trying, yes, to avoid that. That's why we accelerated our political process. We pushed for a national conference that was supposed to take place today. I was so happy, until 10 days ago, that all those Libyan forces invited have all accepted to come and attend. Unfortunately, this attack has compelled us, three days ago, to postpone that meeting because it's very, very hard to discuss and negotiate and agree while the fighting is taking place.
PFEIFFER: There have been protests in Tripoli requesting that the U.N. mission leave Libya. It seems like a loss of trust or a loss of belief that the U.N. can do anything. How do you try to win that trust back?
SALAME: I don't think there is a loss of trust. I think that people are somehow disappointed with the fact that in 2011, there has been a military action, basically allowed by the U.N. but operated by NATO, in order to give a push to those who are in a state of rebellion against Mr. Gadhafi. What Libyans do not understand is that the international system has changed dramatically since then. The Security Council is now in a configuration that does not allow for a resolution similar to the one that was taken then. This is what some Libyans have difficulty understanding.
PFEIFFER: That's Ghassan Salame. He's the U.N. envoy to Libya. Thanks for talking with us.
SALAME: Thank you.

NPR's Sacha Pfeiffer talks to Sudanese activist and protester Mayada Hassanain about President Omar al-Bashir being ousted and women's roles in the protests.
SACHA PFEIFFER, HOST:
In Sudan this weekend, demand for change continues. President Omar al-Bashir stepped down Thursday after 30 years in power. During that time, he sheltered terrorists and was accused of allowing genocide and crimes against humanity in Darfur. His defense minister took his place, but that man stepped aside on Friday. Then yesterday, the country's head of security and intelligence resigned. And Sudanese activists are pressing for more. That includes Mayada Hassanain, an economist based in Khartoum. She's been protesting there for months, and she joins us now.
Mayada, welcome to the program.
MAYADA HASSANAIN: Thank you, Sacha. It's good to be here.
PFEIFFER: So I assume that the past few days have been an emotional roller coaster for Sudan. It finally ousted its leader, but then another autocrat took his place. And that spurred more protests. And suddenly, that person was also gone. How are you feeling now?
HASSANAIN: Yeah. I mean, it's definitely been - it feels a lot longer than a week, for sure. And you know, we've kind of been dealing with just so many emotions. And you know, I've been feeling very hopeful and then suddenly somewhat doubtful. And then, you know, it's back to just being, you know, persistent and making sure that everything that's happened so far is not lost.
And yeah, I mean, it's definitely been a very emotionally charged, you know, few months and especially just the last week. I mean, I think now morales are high. I think people are still, you know, just sort of keeping their eye on their prize of a full democratic transition to a civilian-led government and not a military-led government.
PFEIFFER: When the defense minister stepped in, was that viewed as a coup - and not in a good way?
HASSANAIN: Absolutely, absolutely. You're absolutely right. It was viewed as a coup. It was not - it was - it was viewed - it's sort of a little bit complicated because people were still celebrating the fact that Omar al-Bashir was no longer president. I mean, after 30 years, that is definitely something that you want people to feel happy about, you know?
But at the same time, what was very interesting was that the people still understood that even though they wanted to give themselves time to sort of celebrate on the streets, they knew that this is not the transition that they were going out on the streets protesting for. This was sort of an internal coup on Omar al-Bashir and the select, you know, few of the leaders in there in the National Congress Party and that it was sort of, like, theatrics of change as opposed to the actual, you know, complete transition out of military rule, out of authoritarian rule, out of, you know, NCP repression.
PFEIFFER: NCP is...
HASSANAIN: National Congress Party - that is the party that Omar al-Bashir is the head off.
PFEIFFER: You've said that you want civilian leadership eventually. Even beyond that, what's your long-term hope for Sudan and its government?
HASSANAIN: I mean - you know, as of now, ever since sort of the protests emerged, there was - there's a document called the Declaration of Freedom and Change. And it has, you know, nine main points that move from, you know, reparations to ending the war to women's empowerment to, you know, building civilian capabilities. And this document has sort of had, you know, so much support. So many of the protesters are aware of it. They're like, yes, this is what we want.
You know, there's just these demands like, you know, ending the war in Darfur and Blue Nile, South Kordofan; making sure that people in these conflict zones get, you know, the reparations that they're owed; you know, making sure that the institutions that were sort of built around the NCP and the ruling party and Omar al-Bashir are kind of dismantled. These are just some of the examples that people really and truly want.
And I think, most of all, they just want to make sure that the pillars of, you know, a democratic system that are unwavering and that can withstand, you know, future challenges are put in place now.
PFEIFFER: Mayada, just from your voice, we can hear that you're relatively young; you are youthful. And women and young people have taken on central roles in these protests. Why do you think that is?
HASSANAIN: Well, I think it's because, you know, they have the higher stake in this. You know, it's essentially their future that is being shaped right now by, you know - and that has been shaped by the policies of the NCP over the past three decades. And I think they, you know, unfortunately felt, you know, the brunt of all these unfair policies, of all the corruption, of all of the state repression. You know, it's incredible. So many of the protesters are, you know, as young as 15, 16. It's amazing to see all these people just out in the streets literally putting themselves on the front line of death to fight for their own futures and futures of future generations.
PFEIFFER: That's Mayada Hassanain, who's been among the protesters in Khartoum, Sudan.
Mayada, thank you so much.
HASSANAIN: Thank you very much for having me. Copyright © 2019 NPR. All rights reserved. Visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.

Twitter YouTube A multilingual K-pop juggernaut, BTS mashes up pop, hip-hop, rock and dance music with huge, infectious energy and kinetic choreography. It's one of the biggest bands in the world, and as of this weekend, it's got a Saturday Night Live performance under its belt, too. The Korean septet has built a fan base that's broad (its videos are viewed many hundreds of millions of times each), deep (its fans tend to be intensely devoted, especially on social media) and fully worldwide (its new record, Map of the Soul: Persona , is almost certain to top the U.S. album charts this week).
Every generation gets its own crop of boy bands, but BTS feels like an unusually potent force: Its sound seems to straddle the whole world, the songs are catchy as anything, and each member brings enormous charisma to the mix. Lots of bands can seem strangely diminished by the SNL stage on TV, but on Saturday night, BTS filled every inch of the frame with flashy motion — tight choreography, bright colors, bold energy — as it performed ""Boy With Luv"" (from Map of the Soul ) and ""MIC Drop"" (from 2018's Face Yourself ).
YouTube That BTS has crossed over into the U.S. mainstream pop-cultural consciousness is no surprise; the group has been ascending for years amid a prolific burst of thematically ambitious albums and EPs. But this new surge feels like a genuine tipping point: The SNL appearance dominated social media all weekend, and BTS will drop another heavily hyped spectacle at the Billboard Music Awards on May 1. The group will team up with Halsey — a guest on the studio version of ""Boy With Luv"" — for the latter performance, the news of which broke during commercials Saturday night. Twitter was extremely excited, so strap in: SNL was just the beginning.

A lawyer and her future son-in-law argue furiously about politics on Facebook, each accusing the other of ignoring ""the facts.""
A newly married couple gets into an uncomfortably heated argument as they watch the confirmation hearings of then-Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, until one finally leaves the room. ""I love you, but you're wrong,"" she says.
A Mexican-American college student argues with her Trump-supporting mother — also Mexican-American — about how she could possibly accept the idea of a border wall.
These, of course, are not isolated stories: Political differences can drive a wedge through even the closest families and friendships. A 2017 Reuters/Ipsos poll found that 13 percent of respondents said the 2016 election had caused them to end a relationship with a friend or relative. Nearly 40 percent said the election had provoked at least one argument with a loved one.
More broadly, Americans say they're worried that the United States is growing more polarized and that civility — respect, courtesy, kindness — is slipping away in many aspects of their lives. From road rage to Twitter feuds to the rancor at the highest levels of government, polls show that Americans think incivility is at crisis levels.
Recently, NPR has been traveling the country to explore how people are grappling with the idea of civility in polarizing times.
Here are five stories about the shaky line that people walk to keep things civil — or not — in their most intimate relationships.
'I Love You, But You're Wrong' When Patricia ""P."" Price met Simone Perry in 2016, she was surprised when Simone told her she was Republican. As P. explains, ""Black, lesbian and Republican — it doesn't go in the same sentence."" They got married a year later, and Simone Perry became Simone Price.

Simone, who initially supported Ted Cruz and voted for Gary Johnson in 2016, says P. is more interested in ""how I carry myself and how I treat people than who I support politically."" P., a Democrat who voted for Hillary Clinton, says Simone is much more engaged in politics than she is and wins 90 percent of their political debates.
But several months ago, a debate flared into a fight that P. was not willing to concede. The confirmation hearings for Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court were on TV, and P. says she was ""completely turned off"" by his demeanor.
Simone, on the other hand, sympathized with Kavanaugh's need to defend himself. She remembers asking P., ""If someone we love is ever accused of something, are we going to grant them the benefit of the doubt?""
The argument got angry, uncomfortable. Both women say they often use prayer or meditation to calm themselves if they're fighting, but this political moment called for more immediate action: When P. felt she couldn't take it anymore, she walked out and went upstairs.
The Fight Stays On Facebook Christopher Kilpatrick and Cheryl Hume are about as politically different as two people can be. Chris, 38, describes himself as a ""far-right kind of guy"" who voted for Trump. Cheryl, his 58-year-old future mother-in-law, voted for Hillary Clinton and donates to causes like refugee resettlement and prisoner re-entry programs. They see each other only a few times a year but connect frequently on Facebook, where they clash over everything from Trump's border wall to the latest conspiracy theory.

Hannah Yoon for NPR Civility Wars In An Increasingly Polarized America, Is It Possible To Be Civil On Social Media? Their back-and-forth can get barbed — they sometimes attack each other for being ignorant — but before things get too nasty, one of them changes the subject. ""How's Kathy doing?"" Cheryl might ask.
Kathy is Chris' fiancée and Cheryl's foster daughter. Both Chris and Cheryl say it's their mutual love for Kathy that helps them put their political differences in perspective.
When the family gets together, Chris and Cheryl say, they avoid talking politics, partly to spare Kathy the misery of playing referee, but partly, they say, because they genuinely enjoy each other's company. Chris calls Cheryl ""big hearted,"" and Cheryl describes Chris as a ""good guy.""
But when they return home from a family gathering, Chris and Cheryl retreat to their respective corners on social media and resume sparring. Happily for them, Kathy doesn't pay that much attention to Facebook.

The Reluctant Mediator Lorraine Bank, 67, says she thinks her children were raised right and ""instilled with good values."" But somewhere along the way — through school, TV or the workplace — she thinks her two daughters ""got brainwashed."" Politically, the sisters lean liberal, while Lorraine is a staunch conservative. She says she and her husband mention Trump often enough so their children ""know we think he's a good president, but we don't rub it in.""
That's not always enough for daughter Valerie, 28, who voted for Clinton in 2016. She says she has to steel herself when she visits her parents.
""I do breathing exercises,"" she says. ""Before I get into a conversation, I give myself a pep talk and say, 'I'm going to keep calm, I'm not going to engage, and if someone tries to bait me, I'm not going to take the bait.' ""
Sometimes she has a few drinks to calm herself down. If all else fails, she leaves the room.
For the past few years, Valerie has had to deal with an additional family stress: Her older sister, Sarah, stopped talking to their mother after a serious fight. (Sarah declined to participate in this story.)
As their mother, Lorraine, tells it, after a series of political disagreements, she and Sarah got into a ""final straw"" argument about gay marriage shortly before the 2016 election. At one point, Lorraine referred to gays as ""fags,"" and although she says she later apologized, Sarah still refuses to speak to her.
""I pray every day that whatever is wrong, she can get over it and she'll wake up and know we still love her,"" Lorraine says.
Now, on the few family occasions where everyone is together, Sarah won't interact directly with her mother. Valerie plays the reluctant mediator, trying to knit together a conversation between two people who can no longer find the words.

Democratic Candidate Pete Buttigieg Leans On Record South Bend Mayor,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/14/712412977/pete-buttigieg-helped-transform-south-bend-as-mayor-but-some-feel-left-out?station=KXJZ_FM,"Enlarge this image Mayor Pete Buttigieg in downtown South Bend, Ind., in January, 2019.

Nam Y. Huh/AP Updated at 3:26 p.m. ET
When Molly Hewitt left South Bend, Ind., for college, she didn't think she'd return to live there again. Since the 1960s, the city had suffered the same brain drain that plagued many other Midwestern cities faced with industrial decline.
""The goal was always to be successful enough that you don't have to come back to South Bend,"" she said.
But while she was away, things were turning around. Hewitt's parents kept her in the loop and she decided to give another chance to the city led by Democratic mayor Pete Buttigieg.
""I came back, honestly because of Pete and I've seen a lot of my friends do that and a lot of people who didn't grow up here that want to come to South Bend,"" she said. Now Hewitt is 23, living in South Bend and volunteering for the campaign of James Mueller , the candidate Buttigieg endorsed to replace him in this year's mayoral election.
Buttigieg, 37, officially announced his candidacy for the presidency on Sunday. On the campaign trail he speaks a lot about how being mayor of South Bend since 2012 has prepared him to be president.
""We transformed the trajectory of our city,"" Buttigieg said in an interview on Morning Edition in January. ""This is a community that was written off as dying at the beginning of this decade. Now it's growing again.""
South Bend's population is up more than 1,000 people since 2010 following decades of hemorrhaging tens of thousands of residents.
Investment in the city's downtown, public private partnerships, economic development — including turning the long vacant Studebaker auto plant , which closed its doors in 1963, into a tech hub — have been credited with the change.
