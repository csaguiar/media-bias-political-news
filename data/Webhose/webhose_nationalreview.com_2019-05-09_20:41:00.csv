Eliminate Federal Student Loans | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Kevin D. Williamson,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/eliminate-federal-student-loans/,"April 18, 2019 6:30 AM (Unsplash) It’s time to shut down the Bank of Uncle Stupid.
H ere is a three-part plan for something practical the federal government could do to relieve college-loan debt. Step 1: The federal government should stop making college loans itself and cease guaranteeing any such loans. Step 2: It should prohibit educational lending by federally regulated financial institutions or, if that seems too heavy-handed, require the application of ordinary credit standards in any private educational lending, treating the student himself as the main credit risk in all cases, including those of secured or unsecured loans taken out by parents or other third parties for that student’s educational expenses. And 3: It should make student-loan debt dischargeable in ordinary bankruptcy procedures. Advertisement Advertisement
The most likely end result of this would be the effective abolition of government- and bank-based financing of college education in all but the most narrowly defined circumstances. Good riddance. That leaves about $1.5 trillion in existing debt on the table, a very large number from which the federal government derives very little income, about 0.1 percent a year, or $1.5 billion — a fact that should enter into our calculations about whether we attempt to collect every nickel of that money or, perhaps, slowly forgive some of that debt for students who keep up with their payments and are otherwise good citizens, maybe at a rate of 2 percent of the principal a year.
It is time to shut down the Bank of Uncle Stupid. Advertisement
Colleges will have two choices: Bring their tuitions down to a more reasonable rate or, if they are so inclined, work out financing arrangements of their own. This would not present too much trouble to splendidly endowed schools such as Harvard and Princeton, or to public schools with substantial resources at their disposal. A senior official of my alma mater, the University of Texas, once caused a stir by confessing — in public — that UT Austin doesn’t need to charge tuition at all but does so mainly as a population-control mechanism. The problem, he said, wasn’t money as such but the fact that the state would not let him raise admissions standards. Admittedly, UT has become a little more selective in recent years.
I have a theory about why there has been so much tuition inflation: inflation . Advertisement
When we talk about “inflation,” we generally mean to denote a general rise in consumer prices; but, properly understood, that is the result of inflation, not inflation itself. Inflation itself is an increase in the money supply, and its effects need not necessarily be general. You can inflate the money supply by printing money, but you can also do it by expanding credit. Our friends at the National Association of Realtors and other charter members of the Committee to Reinflate the Housing Bubble, for example, have a keen understanding of the relationship between loosey-goosey mortgage-lending standards and brisk sales in the face of rising housing prices (and rising commissions). Your local new- or used-car dealer knows that he can charge higher prices for vehicles that are to be financed by people who care more about their monthly payment than about the total cost. There are some critics of the federal response to the 2008–09 financial crisis who believe that the recent run-up in the stock markets and the prices of other assets is fundamentally the result of inflation through quantitative easing and other measures. (You don’t have to believe that that was a necessarily bad policy to believe that this is true, incidentally.) Easy credit contributes to higher prices.
If you make a few gazillion dollars available to finance tuition payments with underwriting standards a little bit lower than those of the average pawn shop, you create a lot of potential tuition inflation. Another way of saying this is that if Uncle Stupid puts a trillion bucks on the table, there are enough smart people at Harvard to figure out a way to pick it up. Advertisement
We managed to provide college educations to those wanting them for many generations without creating a body of debt larger than all of the credit-card bills in the nation combined. Our colleges have become faintly ridiculous places, in terms of their modest academic ambitions (lookin’ at you, journalism majors, women’s-studies departments, undergraduate programs in business administration), their top-heavy administrative structures (the number of administrators per student has exploded along with college debt, suggesting that colleges are being treated as full-employment programs for the politically connected classes), their resort-style amenities, etc. We accept more students but educate far fewer of them — at much greater expense. Advertisement
The best way to impose a little discipline on that mess is to make students, their families, and, most important, the institutions themselves carry their own water. The current system is exploitative: The students essentially function as a conveyor belt carrying government money into the universities, leaving borrowers instead of taxpayers on the hook because it looks better from an accounting point of view: If we just gave the universities money, that would show up on the books as an expenditure; lending it to students allows us to pretend that we have created an asset when all we have actually created is a great deal of debt and horses**t. Advertisement Advertisement
And, hard as it is to believe, it’s even worse in the so-called trade schools and “professional” programs advertised in subways and buses from coast to coast. If you want to know how much money has been transferred to the nation’s bartending academies, the Professional Golfers Career College, or the Northwest School of Wooden Boat Building under the guise of student lending, look here ."
"Identity Politics Thwarts Solutions to Immigration Crisis, Federal Spending | National Review",www.nationalreview.com,Victor Davis Hanson,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/things-that-cant-go-on-forever-simply-dont/,"April 18, 2019 6:30 AM Protesters march against President Trump’s proposed border wall in El Paso, Texas, January 26, 2019. (Jose Luis Gonzalez/Reuters) The present identity-politics divisiveness is not a sustainable model for a multiracial nation, and it will soon reach its natural limits one way or another.
E conomist Herbert Stein’s old adage – “If something cannot go on forever, it will stop” – still holds.
Take illegal immigration.
There are currently somewhere from eleven million to 15 million immigrants living in the United States without legal authorization. Last month, nearly 100,000 people were apprehended or turned away while trying to illegally cross the southern border. Some experts suggest that at least that number made it across without arrest. At that rate, the United States would be gaining a fairly large city of undocumented arrivals each month. Advertisement Advertisement
Most of the people who enter the United States illegally arrive without fluency in English, a high-school diploma, competitive job skills, or money. The majority will require support subsidies, and collectively they will require increased legal and law-enforcement investments.
At some point, American social services will be so taxed that the system will be rendered dysfunctional – as is already occurring in areas of the American Southwest. Or, some regions of America will so resemble the countries undocumented immigrants abandoned that there will be little point in heading north. Advertisement
Either way, the current border chaos will find its own self-correcting mechanisms, even if that means there will be no border at all – or northern Mexico and the southern United States will become indistinguishable. Advertisement
Currently, the national debt is $22 trillion and growing at a rate of nearly $1 trillion a year due to staggering annual budget deficits. The George W. Bush and Barack Obama administrations roughly doubled the debt they inherited, and the Donald Trump administration may be on schedule to do the same.
More importantly, the national debt is now over 100 percent of the gross domestic product.
Presidents and Congress like to spend and to spread money to voters. They fear politically suicidal recessions if they cut back. But over the last 20 years, the government has mostly exhausted traditional economic stimuli such as larger budget deficits, near-zero real interest rates and expansion of the money supply. Advertisement
Common sense would dictate that in the present boom cycle, the president and Congress would get together to reduce discretionary spending and at least curb the growth of entitlements before we enter the next inevitable recession. Advertisement
Otherwise, history outlines a lot of near-automatic solutions to unsustainable government borrowing. Sometimes massive inflation ensues, as the government is forced to print currency to pay bondholders with play money, eroding the assets of those who are thrifty and put cash savings in the bank.
Sometimes more desperate governments simply renounce their obligations to bondholders, on the principle that such creditors are well off anyway and can afford the losses.
Another solution has been simply to slash defense spending and entitlements, and hope that neither a war abroad nor civil strife at home breaks out.
The common result of all these draconian solutions is a general distrust of government. The big fear is an ensuing Venezuela-like nightmare, with shortages, violence, black markets, mass flight, corruption, and hatred of elected officials.
For history’s rare multiracial and multiethnic republics, an “e pluribus unum” cohesion is essential. Each particular tribe must owe greater allegiance to the commonwealth than to those who superficially look or worship alike. Advertisement
Yet over the last 20 years, we have deprecated “unity” and championed “diversity.” Americans are being urged by popular culture, universities, schools, and government to emphasize their innate differences rather than their common similarities.
Sometimes the strained effort turns comical. Some hyphenate or add accents or foreign pronunciations to their names. Others fabricate phony ethnic pedigrees in hopes of gaining an edge in job-seeking or admissions.
The common theme is to be anything other than just normal Americans for whom race, gender, and ethnicity are incidental rather than essential to their character.
But unchecked tribalism historically leads to nihilism. Meritocracy is abandoned as bureaucrats select their own rather than the best qualified. A Tower of Babel chaos ensues as the common language is replaced by myriad local tongues, in the fashion of fifth-century imperial Rome. Class differences are subordinated to tribal animosities. Almost every contentious issue is distilled into racial or ethnic victims and victimizers.
History always offers guidance to the eventual end game when people are unwilling to give up their chauvinism. Vicious tribal war can break out as in contemporary Syria. The nation can fragment into ethnic enclaves as seen in the Balkans. Or factions can stake out regional no-go zones of power as we’ve seen in Iraq and Libya. Advertisement"
Electric-Vehicle Tax Credit Mainly Benefits Wealthy Owners | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,George Will,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/electric-vehicle-tax-credit-benefits-wealthy-owners/,"Follow George Will on Twitter April 18, 2019 6:30 AM A woman gets into her Tesla electric car at a supercharger station in Los Angeles, Calif., in 2018. (Lucy Nicholson/Reuters) It efficiently illustrates how government can, with one act, diminish its already negligible prestige while subtracting from America’s fairness.
Washington — Some government foolishness has an educational value that compensates for its considerable cost. Consider the multibillion-dollar federal electric-vehicle tax credit, which efficiently illustrates how government can, with one act, diminish its already negligible prestige while subtracting from America’s fairness. Senator John Barrasso (R., Wyo.) and Representative Jason Smith (R., Mo.) hope to repeal the tax credit, which probably will survive because it does something that government enjoys doing: It transfers wealth upward by subsidizing affluent individuals and large economic entities. Advertisement
In 1992, Congress, with its itch to supplant the market in telling people what to build and buy, established a subsidy for buyers of electric vehicles, which then were a negligible fraction of the vehicle market. In 2009, however, as the nation reeled from the Great Recession, the Obama administration acted on an axiom of the president’s chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel: “You never want a serious crisis to go to waste.” Using the crisis as an excuse to do what they wanted to do anyway, those who think government planning of the U.S. economy is a neat idea joined with environmentalists to persuade Congress — persuading it to dispense money is not difficult — to create a tax credit of up to $7,500 for consumers who buy battery-powered electric vehicles.
The tax credit was part of the administration’s “stimulus” package, which is most remembered for its promise of “shovel-ready” jobs. The president, too busy expanding the government to understand the consequences of prior expansions, discovered that such jobs are almost nonexistent, thanks to red tape that must be untangled before shovels can be wielded. Advertisement
The tax credit quickly became another example of the government’s solicitousness for those who are comfortable, and who are skillful in defense of their comforts. Today, demand for electric cars is still insufficient to produce manufacturing economies of scale (after a decade of production, moral exhortations, and subsidies, electric cars are a fraction of 1 percent of all vehicle sales), and batteries are expensive. So, the Wall Street Journal reports, the $42,000 average price for an electric car is $8,000 more than the average price of a new car, and $22,000 more than the average price of a new small gasoline-powered car.
The Pacific Research Institute has examined 2014 IRS data showing that 79 percent of the electric-vehicle tax credits were collected by households with adjusted gross incomes of more than $100,000, and 1 percent by households earning less than $50,000. A 2017 survey found that households earning $200,000 received the most from the tax credit. Advertisement Advertisement
Some states have augmented the federal credit: In California, where about half of electric vehicles are sold, consumers can gain up to $15,000; in insolvent Connecticut — blue states are incorrigible — $10,500. The credit is, however, capped: Manufacturers can only sell 200,000 vehicles eligible for the full credit. Now almost all manufacturers (including high-end companies Bentley, Aston Martin, and Maserati) are entering the electric-vehicle sector, and the cap is impinging on some of them (General Motors, Nissan). So, at long last, such vehicles can be allowed to sink or swim on their own, right?
Of course not. The Barrasso-Smith legislation is fiercely opposed by the manufacturers, who of course want to expand and entrench it by removing the cap, partly because they know what the Journal knows: “When Georgia ended its $5,000 state tax credit in 2015, sales of electric vehicles fell 89% in two months.”
Electric cars have cachet with advanced thinkers who want to be, or to be seen to be, environmentally nice. They do not think of such vehicles as 27.4 percent coal cars, that being the percentage of U.S. electricity generated by coal-fired power plants. According to a Manhattan Institute study:
[B]ecause of stringent emissions standards and low-sulfur gasoline, new ICVs [internal combustion vehicles] today emit very little pollution, and they will emit even less in the future. Compared with new ICVs, ZEVs [zero-emissions vehicles] charged with the forecast mix of electric generation will emit more criteria air pollutants.
And the reduction of carbon dioxide — “less than 1% of total forecast[ed] energy-related U.S. CO2 emissions through 2050” — “will have no measurable impact on climate."
Democratic Party’s Politics of Fear | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Kyle Smith,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/politics-fear-ezra-klein-vox-democratic-party/,"Follow Kyle Smith on Twitter April 18, 2019 6:30 AM President Barack Obama participates in an interview with Vox’s Ezra Klein (center) and Sarah Kliff at Blair House in 2017. (Carlos Barria/Reuters) Vox 's Ezra Klein would do better to examine his own party’s many phobias.
F ew techniques enrage more effectively than a single-word admonition to “relax.” Try it sometime when someone is upset; it’s lighter fluid on the fire, every time. Smug people know this, including the Sultan of Smug, Ezra Klein.
The founder of the young-adult site Vox is back with yet another essay saying, “Relax, conservatives.” This one repeats a favorite myth of the smug-progressive Left, which is that conservatism is powered by “fear.” Klein thinks that if only conservatives would relax about inevitable “change,” and vote accordingly, we could all march forward together into a shiny new era of tolerance, compassion, free-thinking, and love. It’ll be like Woodstock, only with better toilets. Advertisement Advertisement
When Klein talks about “change,” he is thinking of demography. He believes conservatives are getting driven off the rails by fears of black people and Muslims and documentation-challenged immigrants and maybe feminists and abstract art. Going back a bit, we had an “inordinate fear of Communism,” in Jimmy Carter’s famous words. Klein is chill about all of these things and urges us to be as fear-free as he is. As all the smugprogs are. As the Democratic party inherently is.
All Klein is actually doing here is proving his status as a bubble boy who never sets foot outside his comfortably furnished, intellectually climate-controlled living space. He is so intellectually dishonest that he is able to fool even himself. Advertisement
In fact, Klein and his party are all about fear. The Democratic party is defined by fear of climate change, of the police, of incipient theocracy, of white supremacists with tiki torches. It fears that the American Dream is dead, that the next generation will be far worse off, that abortions will have to be performed with coat hangers, and that capitalism is corrupt. It fears fascism, racism, Donald Trump, and the millionaires and billionaires who are hogging all the wealth. It fears GMOs and fast food and food deserts and that people are eating too much meat and that the planet will run out of food. It fears toxic masculinity, rape culture, and college fraternities. It fears gentrification and charter schools. It fears that fake news and Fox News and the Russians are going to steal the next election. It fears that the Koch Brothers and Ben Shapiro and Sinclair Broadcasting are warping millions of minds and that their reach is growing. It fears money spent by corporations in political campaigns and that millions of Americans are about to lose their health insurance. It fears voter suppression and voting machines. It fears the “change” that might be wrought by the Supreme Court and it fears the “change” that Amazon might have brought to Queens. It fears nuclear energy and school shootings and Chick-fil-A and anti-vaxxers. It fears that we are living on Page One of The Handmaid’s Tale . It fears having babies who will surely grow up in misery because of all of the above. Advertisement
I don’t have to go to the Left’s equivalent of Sean Hannity to find all this. It’s right there on Klein’s own site every day . Vox’s motto might as well be, “All the stuff that young adults fear.” Even the smugprogs whom Klein singles out as examples of fearless politicians are avatars of fear. Advertisement"
Bernie Sanders Is a One-Percenter | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Mona Charen,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/bernie-sanders-wealth-taxes/,"April 18, 2019 6:30 AM Sen. Bernie Sanders speaks on Capitol Hill in 2018. (Joshua Roberts/Reuters) If his wealth is tainted, it isn’t because he siphoned it from others. He earned it by peddling twaddle.
I n 2016 and 2017, Bernie Sanders raked in over a million bucks. Last year, his gross income was down to $561,293 — still not too shabby. The point is not to rib the senator about his membership in the top 1 percent, though that’s tempting. Nor is it to chide him for his relatively paltry charitable donations. His contributions to charity represented only 3.4 percent of his income, it’s true, but compared with some of his competitors in the Democratic field, that was generous. Beto O’Rourke reportedly contributed only one-third of one percent of his 2017 income ($370,412), and he may have underpaid his taxes by $4,000 by taking medical deductions in excess of the permitted amount. Amy Klobuchar, Kamala Harris, and Kirsten Gillibrand all gave less than 2 percent of their incomes away. Cory Booker and Pete Buttigieg have yet to release their tax returns, and of course President Trump is hiding behind a spectral audit (still not complete, three years on?) that in any case would present no legal obstacle to disclosure. Why he is hiding his “beautiful” tax returns is up to the imagination. Advertisement
The question for Bernie Sanders is: How can you sleep at night knowing that you became rich at the expense of the middle class and the poor?
“But I didn’t,” he would doubtless protest. “I made my money by selling thousands of copies of Our Revolution .” Speaking on Fox News, he was defiant: “If anyone thinks I should apologize for writing a bestselling book, I’m sorry, I’m not going to do it.”
But he should apologize, according to his own logic. How many times has Bernie Sanders alleged that “millionaires and billionaires” are siphoning off all of the nation’s wealth and hoarding it for themselves? Here’s a typical example from a 2015 interview with the Des Moines Register :
Is it right that the middle class continues to disappear while there has been a massive transfer of wealth from working families to the top one-tenth of 1 percent? Trillions of dollars in the last 30 years have flowed from the middle class to the top one-tenth of 1 percent. And the American people say, ‘No, that’s not right.’
It’s also not true. Not remotely. Millionaires and billionaires acquire wealth by producing products and services that other people want to buy, from computers to Greek yogurt to bad books like Our Revolution . Sure, some millionaires and billionaires are born into wealth, but even they haven’t subtracted from the net worth of any other American. In fact, the rich tend to improve the lives of other Americans by 1) providing them with jobs, and 2) buying the products they manufacture, and 3) paying high taxes, and 4) contributing generously to charities (well, most rich people anyway, not presidential contenders).
As for Sanders’s notion that we have witnessed a “transfer of wealth from working families to the top one-tenth of 1 percent” — this is gibberish. How did that transfer happen? Were working families taxed heavily and the tippy-top one percenters excused? In that case, though it would be wrong to call it a transfer of wealth (the money wasn’t being deposited in Bill Gates’s account), it would amount to the rich being free riders when it comes to enjoying the goods of government including national defense, roads, food inspection, and so forth. Advertisement
But, of course, that’s fantasy. As the Tax Foundation reports, in 2016 the top 1 percent earned 19.7 percent of total national income and paid 37.3 percent of income taxes. We have progressive tax rates, so the top 1 percent paid average taxes of 26.9 percent, which is seven times higher than taxpayers in the bottom half of the income distribution. Advertisement
As the for the “shrinking middle class” Senator Sanders is always lamenting, it is shrinking, but only because so many more Americans are joining the upper class. If “middle class” is defined as households between two-thirds and twice the median household income, then the percentage has declined from 61 percent in 1971 to 50 percent in 2015. As Mark Perry of the American Enterprise Institute notes, those people can go only one of two places: up or down. Most of those who are no longer in the middle class are in the upper class (though some fell below as well). In 1969, fewer than one out of twelve households earned $100,000 or more. By 2016, 27.7 percent were in that category. Politicians thrive on stories of decline and victimization, but the story of the past few decades — despite ups and downs — is one of increasing national wealth."

1990 —Dissenting in Osborne v. Ohio , Justices Brennan, Marshall, and Stevens opine that possession of child pornography is protected by the First Amendment. Though unmoored from any plausible meaning of the First Amendment, their position is a logical extension of Justice Marshall’s activist ruling in Stanley v. Georgia (see This Day for April 7 , 1969). And faithless as they are to the actual Constitution and to precedents with which they disagree, liberal judicial activists vigorously apply activist precedents.
1990— At the same time that it unanimously holds that a federal district judge, in implementing a desegregation plan, lacked the authority to directly impose an increase in the property-tax levy in a school district, the Supreme Court decides, by a 5-to-4 vote (in Missouri v. Jenkins ), that the judge may direct the school district to increase the property tax and may enjoin the operation of any contrary state laws.
Writing in dissent (and joined by Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justices O’Connor and Scalia), Justice Anthony Kennedy disputes the “purported distinction between direct imposition of a tax by the federal court and an order commanding the school district to impose the tax,” and he condemns the majority holding:
“Today’s casual embrace of taxation imposed by the unelected, life-tenured Federal Judiciary disregards fundamental precepts for the democratic control of public institutions.”
2007 —Dissenting from the Supreme Court’s rejection (in Gonzales v. Carhart ) of a facial challenge to the constitutionality of the federal Partial-Birth Abortion Act of 2003, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg predicts that as-applied challenges to the law “will be mounted swiftly, to ward off serious, sometimes irremediable harm, to women whose health would be endangered by the intact D&E prohibition.” In fact, years later, not a single such challenge will have been brought. Why not? Probably because (as I explored in “ The Mystery of the Missing Lawsuits ”) the abortion industry’s medical evidence that Ginsburg was so eager to credit has always been very feeble.

(Yuri Gripas/Reuters)
The rise of Pete Buttigieg has been fairly astonishing to behold. It’s an entirely media-driven phenomenon, but then again the media can chauffeur a guy straight into the White House. As we’ve seen.
New polls have Mayor Pete in third place in both Iowa and New Hampshire. It’s a pretty distant third, but when you consider that Buttigieg was completely unknown until ten seconds ago, and recall the years of adoring media attention given Cory Booker and Elizabeth Warren, not to mention a ton of favorable coverage of Kamala Harris and nearly a year of nonstop propagandizing for Beto O’Rourke that would embarrass Kim Jong-un’s press chief, it’s astonishing that Buttigieg is even in the same group as these other candidates, much less ahead of them (by very small margins in some cases). (Oh, and Kirsten Gillibrand, your candidacy is already over. You’re at, or close to, zero. This is as good as it gets for you. Enjoy your lovely parting gifts.) Advertisement Advertisement
These last couple of weeks the media have been enacting the Distracted Boyfriend meme, swiveling their collective head from previous It Boy Beto to the new coolness, Buttigieg. Politico ’s acerbic media critic Jack Shafer ponders the question of what made the media dump Pete for Beto: “Think of Buttigieg as a newborn just delivered to his newsroom parents, his every grin and wink and grimace worthy of endless analysis and discussion, and you begin to fathom the press corps’ fascination with him.”"
S. Craig Zahler's Unapologetic Pulp Fiction,www.nationalreview.com,,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/magazine/2019/05/06/dragged-across-concrete-unapologetic-pulp-fiction/,"April 18, 2019 11:32 AM Mel Gibson in Dragged across Concrete (Unified Pictures)
I t is not necessarily praise to say of someone “he would have been more successful in the ’70s,” but I’m pretty sure S. Craig Zahler would take it as a compliment. Zahler is the writer and director of a series of extremely long, carefully composed, brutally violent movies, which have mostly had their life on video and on-demand. Each one has starred big names (Kurt Russell, Vince Vaughn) somewhat on the down side of their careers; the latest, Dragged across Concrete , stars Mel Gibson as a racist cop suspended for putting his foot on a suspect’s head, a casting move that naturally has created extra interest and controversy for the film. Advertisement Advertisement
Some of that attention has been dismissive, depicting Zahler as just a right-wing provocateur. But some has been more intriguing, and intrigued. “A singular, dangerous talent,” The Ringer ’s Scott Tobias called Zahler, while asking of his filmography: “How often are American viewers confronted by a movie that doesn’t need to be liked?”
The answer, in the age of blockbusters and algorithms and fan service, is not often. I had not watched any Zahler before his latest movie, so last week I watched Concrete back to back with Brawl in Cell Block 99 , his second effort, from 2017. (His first film, Bone Tomahawk , a pulp western in which Russell fights cannibals, I’m saving to watch on a completely empty stomach.) I can report that his films are not for the faint of heart, that they are politically incorrect without being politically didactic, that they have dialogue that wavers between pretension and perfection, and that they have an entirely distinctive and unapologetic style. Is that an endorsement? Yes, I think it is. Advertisement
Both movies are essentially pulp fiction, offered with Tarantino-esque enthusiasm for the grindhouse but without his irony or adolescent glee. Both are concerned with the conflict between bad men who have a code and bad men who are essentially satanic. In neither case do you get the Death Wish –style vigilante scenario in which a normal person is just pushed too far. Nobody has to push Zahler’s protagonists: They’re violent men who end up in dire situations because of their own mistakes and sins. Nor are their lives sentimentalized or their criminal chops admired. We are on their side only because they end up against something much worse than mere criminality and vice.
In Brawl , the protagonist, Bradley Thomas, is played by a looming, stoic, bald, and tattooed Vaughn: He’s a former boxer whom we first see destroying a car in rage over his wife’s infidelity, only to go inside and calmly decide that they should stay together and try to have another child. To support them, he becomes the muscle for a drug dealer, promising that it will be temporary, but by the time she gets pregnant it seems permanent. Then a deal goes wrong, and Vaughn’s character makes a moral but unwise choice, one that lands him in prison and in the crosshairs of a drug lord, who kidnaps his wife and threatens to have an abortionist maim their child in utero unless he figures out a way to get into the titular maximum-security cell block and murder someone held therein. Advertisement Advertisement
The violence that follows is substantial, since Vaughn’s character has to deal out considerable punishment just to get himself assigned to cell block 99. But the movie is also unusually at leisure — giving us a long introduction to prison-intake systems, allowing minor characters to flare and vanish without being strictly necessary to the plot. The dialogue is hard-boiled, writerly, sardonic, ultimately sincere.
The same habits are at work in Dragged across Concrete . Vaughn returns as Lurasetti, the junior partner to Gibson’s cop, Ridgeman, an aging detective who’s curdling into bigotry and brutality. Together they get suspended for the Gibson character’s not-terrible-but-still-excessive use of force; together they decide to rob a drug dealer (the older cop wants to move his family out of a bad neighborhood; the younger one is proposing to his too-smart-for-him girlfriend); together they end up dragged into a horror-show bank robbery carried out by psychopaths. Dragged with them is the alternative protagonist, Henry (Tory Kittles), a small-time hood hired as the getaway driver, trying to earn money to support his wayward mother and crippled kid brother. Dragged as well are a lot of innocents, to whom it would be unwise to become attached. Advertisement"

Williamson April 18, 2019 11:35 AM Actress Felicity Huffman, facing charges in a nationwide college admissions cheating scheme, leaves federal court in Boston, Mass., April 3, 2019. (Brian Snyder/Reuters) You’re not sorry if you’re trying to get something by saying so
F elicity Huffman, an overripe actress charged with fraud in a high-profile college-admissions scandal, has learned at least one thing about professional stagecraft: Always listen to the writer .
She got a pretty good one to do her apology, which reads in part:
I am in full acceptance of my guilt, and with deep regret and shame over what I have done, I accept full responsibility for my actions and will accept the consequences that stem from those actions. I am ashamed of the pain I have caused my daughter, my family, my friends, my colleagues and the educational community. I want to apologize to them and, especially, I want to apologize to the students who work hard every day to get into college, and to their parents who make tremendous sacrifices to support their children and do so honestly.
That is a classical good apology: admission of guilt, statement of regret, specific acknowledgments of harm done — and no excuses. No sudden recollection of childhood abuse or trauma, no prescription-drug side effects, no checking herself into rehab. That’s the kind of apology that might keep you out of jail.
And it’s an increasingly rare thing.
Former Full House actress Lori Loughlin, charged in the same scandal, is going the opposite direction. She has pleaded not guilty to the charges. People magazine quotes an “insider” — Lori Loughlin “insiders” are a thing, apparently — explaining the situation. “She felt that she hadn’t done anything that any mom wouldn’t have done, if they had the means to do so.” On top of bad public-relations advice, she’s apparently getting bad legal advice, too. “To her, it wasn’t egregious behavior. Was it entitled and perhaps selfish? Perhaps. But she didn’t see it as being a legal violation.” That’s going to go over just not terribly well: “It didn’t feel like a felony, your honor.” Advertisement
If you’re wondering which is the dumb one, now you know. Advertisement
Apologies in the early 21st century have become almost entirely self-interested affairs — which, in a sense, means that they are not authentic apologies. Which is fair enough, since they are so often demanded for things that are not authentic offenses.
Our apologies are instrumental and, in a popular culture in which people pride themselves on being media-savvy (irrespective of whether they have any real experience in such things), there is a kind of self-conscious cynicism about apologies and the uses to which they may be put. In much the same way that every barstool NFL analyst fancies himself a Bill Belichick in waiting, the gawkers of the political and celebrity worlds (to the extent that they are today distinguishable from each other) like to play spin doctor, thinking of themselves as masters of the dark arts of opinion manipulation. Advertisement
They do not ask whether the apology was honest, but whether it worked . Advertisement
For example, public figures of various kinds constantly are having to apologize for violating social taboos that did not exist five minutes ago: pronoun abuse, “dead-naming,” “cultural appropriation,” etc. Bryan Cranston, the great actor, has been hounded for months by critics who want him to apologize for playing a disabled man when he is not, in fact, disabled. (He is also neither a New Mexico public-school teacher turned meth kingpin nor Lyndon Baines Johnson.) So far, he has held out. But he’s a rarity: Scarlett Johansson groveled and ran away when criticized for accepting the role of a historical character who might have been transsexual. Emma Stone apologized for playing a part-Hawaiian woman who wasn’t supposed to look part-Hawaiian, which Emma Stone isn’t and doesn’t. These apologies serve a pretty obvious purpose: These people would like to continue working and being celebrities, and they fear the mob. That no one really takes them seriously is almost beside the point: This is a ritual, and a kind of game — a contest.
Like much of the tone of our current public life — and much that is wrong with it — this tendency first announced itself in the late 1990s in the person of Bill Clinton, who, lucky for him, followed his career as a politician and intern botherer before there were hashtags. When President Clinton finally was no longer able to keep lying about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky, he offered an angry half-apology during which he heaped bile on the special prosecutors investigating him. That did not work . And so he tried again — about a half-dozen times, in fact. A week and a half after his first vitriolic non-apology, he struck a new tone: whiny. “I’m having to become quite an expert in this business of asking for forgiveness,” he said, though the expertise was not in evidence. Advertisement
That failed, too, and so he tried a maneuver I call the Exalted Cyclops, after Senator Robert K. Byrd, the Democratic grandee and quondam Klan boss who often talked about how he had apologized for his KKK ways without ever actually seeming to have made any substantive public apology. Clinton didn’t really apologize, but insisted he had: “You know, I have acknowledged that I made a mistake, said that I regretted it, asked to be forgiven, spent a lot of very valuable time with my family in the last couple of weeks.” Yeah. I’ll bet “valuable” is exactly how Mrs. Clinton remembers it.
That sank, too, and so two days later it was “a big mistake” and “indefensible.” Advertisement Advertisement
Some Democrats founded a group called MoveOn.org — after eleven minutes, it was time to “move on” from the scandal and the perjury and all that ruckus — and the president got a little ahead of himself: Two days after “indefensible” it was time for “reconciliation and healing.” And, later that day, it was back on the public, not the president: “I’ve tried to do a good job taking care of this country, even when I haven’t taken such good care of myself and my family and my obligations. I hope that you and others I have injured will forgive me for the mistakes I’ve made, but the most important thing is you must not let it deter you from meeting your responsibilities as citizens.”
That was a heck of a time to start lecturing people about their responsibilities .
Young Barack Obama surely was paying attention and would put the lesson into effect some years later when, criticized for his longtime association with the racist loon Jeremiah Wright, he gave a speech in which he hectored other Americans — Americans at large — about their racial hang-ups. He didn’t even make a pro forma apology, just straight for the neck. “As imperfect as . . . he may be,” he said of his pastor, “he has been like family to me.” Advertisement
“ I’m sorry? You’re sorry!” It helps if you read it in Robert De Niro’s Taxi Driver voice.
Harvey Weinstein tried that approach, too, roughly: “I’m sorry? The NRA should be sorry!” He had less success: Obama had better writers.
President Clinton got real sorry real quick when the big stick came out and he was impeached. The public and his family got angry half-apologies: Congress got groveling. “What I want the American people to know, what I want the Congress to know, is that I am profoundly sorry for all I have done wrong in words and deeds,” Clinton said. “I never should have misled the country, the Congress , my friends, and my family. . . . Mere words cannot fully express the profound remorse I feel for what our country is going through, and for what members of both parties in Congress are now forced to deal with. These past months have been a torturous process of coming to terms with what I did. I understand that accountability demands consequences, and I’m prepared to accept them. Painful though the condemnation of the Congress would be, it would pale in comparison to the consequences of the pain I have caused my family.”
No one believed that, of course, and no one pretended to — not even that fink Bill Clinton, really. People just kind of kept score. Clinton got reelected and did a little F***-You dance on the lawn in the Rose Garden — advantage: Big Creep. Advertisement
By one count, Hillary Rodham Clinton included almost 40 different apologies in her book What Happened. These were not exactly exercises in heartfelt contrition: “I regret handing Trump a political gift with my ‘deplorables’ comments,” she wrote. “I am sorry about that.” Sorry about gratuitously insulting people? Please — she’s sorry in the way someone who shoots himself in the foot is sorry. She’s genuinely sorry she lost.
The memory of Mrs. Clinton’s presidential campaign calls to mind the case of Nick Burchill, who was banned for life by the Fairmont Empress Hotel in Victoria, Canada, because of a mishap involving a suitcase packed with pepperoni. (How do you travel?) He left his hotel window open, to help keep the pepperoni cool, and . . .
“I remember walking down the long hall and opening the door to my room to find an entire flock of seagulls in my room,” he wrote in his letter of apology to the hotel. “I didn’t have time to count, but there must have been 40 of them and they had been in my room, eating pepperoni for a long time.”
Seagulls. Eating pepperoni.
For a long time.
“They immediately started flying around and crashing into things as they desperately tried to leave the room through the small opening by which they had entered. The result was a tornado of seagull excrement, feathers, pepperoni chunks and fairly large birds whipping around the room.” After almost 20 years and a pretty good letter of apology, his exile was lifted.
Burchill got a long stay in the woodshed for what was an honest mistake, if a stupid one. Felicity Huffman probably will never find herself declared persona non grata by a nice hotel. Bill Clinton is welcomed almost everywhere. Advertisement"
Republicans' Nazi Comparisons from the Left | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,James Lileks,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/magazine/2019/05/06/fuhrer-for-a-term/,"Follow James Lileks on Twitter April 18, 2019 11:40 AM A protester holds a sign against candidate Donald Trump outside the California Republican party convention in Burlingame, Calif., April 29, 2016.

W hat will the Democrats run on in 2020 if the economy is good? Perhaps a return to the normal discourse, where the rubes are smoothed and groomed by soft hands and silver tongues and can be herded into the pen of consensus. The rhetoric will be familiar, but there’s a complication this time. It’s hard to reach out to people you despise.
Sample blather you might get from earnest candidates:
“We have to join together to fight the people who have joined us to fight! Only through unity can all of us unite, and only by putting aside our differences can we agree on the things that divide us.”
Uh — okay, but I don’t agree with you.
“And that’s fine! Not agreeing is what makes America great. We can find common ground where we both can stand, together.”
Yeah, but what about regulations that forbid us to stand on that particular ground because it was a wetland in 1964 and has to be preserved to protect the habitat of a hermaphroditic weevil?
“Then together, on different parts of ground that border the common ground, we can reach across and do the work that needs doing. I see an America where everyone does the doing, works the work, and does not shirk from the hard tasks of making tomorrow not only happen, but happen for everyone.”
Tomorrow, by definition, happens for everyone who does not expire before sunrise. Are you proposing federal regulations that make it illegal to die between sundown and sunup? Let me guess: the Dare All to Wake Now Act, or DAWN. It contains a package of incentives to keep people from dying before sunup, as defined by the National Weather Service. People who die before sunup shall be fined on a graduated scale. Is that it?
And so on. You suspect that the Dems really want to run on America’s wrack and ruin: This nation has always been a racist, patriarchal hellscape, except for a brief shining moment between 2008 and 2016, when it seemed possible — nay, likely — that everyone in the future would be a gender-neutral Web programmer. Everyone who mattered, anyway.
How do they find a polite way to let everyone know that Trump is literally Hitler and must be replaced with figurative Marx?
A recent Twitter thread with almost 10,000 likes and retweets detailed how far down the Hitler Path we’ve gone, including building a wall whose real purpose is to keep people trapped in America.
Really? you say. Yes. According to the #Resistance side of Twitter, the president’s Schicklgruberness is obvious, but you wonder if they have any historical knowledge. We already had a Hitler president, the previous iteration being the blood-and-oil-soaked George W. McChimpy Bushitler. He was such a grave threat to international peace and happiness that the Left deployed every tool it had, from mocking photoshops to papier-mâché puppets, and it worked: Chastened, he did not declare himself Führer, probably on advice from Dick Cheney, who thought he’d mispronounce it.
Ah am yore Furr-hurr! Heil, y’all!
(Cheney rolls eyes, thinks, “We’ll take another run at this in eight years.”)
So the Left probably believes, anyway. People with long memories — past 2016, I mean — recall that Hitleresque terminology was floated to describe Panamanian dictator Noriega. When he was in the news, some people thought his actual name was “Strongman Noriega,” since that’s how he was always described, as if he wore an animal-print tunic and lifted barbells in a circus. It is difficult to remember why someone who looked like a malevolent pineapple rose to near-Hitler status, but it was a more peaceful time.
Saddam Hussein had a better run as the next Hitler, since he had an ideology — Ba’athism, which sounds like socialism for sheep — and ethnic quarrels. He had an enemy to the east. Like Hitler, he fancied himself an artist — the German dictator painted, Hussein wrote novels in his own blood, which is really the definition of self-publishing.
Bonus — he threw rockets at the Jews! You’d think this would be an important part of the neo-Hitler definition and would disqualify Bush the Latter and Trump. But the Left just defined Muslims as the new Jews, and Jews became honorary Christians of a sort — meaning, you could hate them now, to your immense relief — and all was good.
Now Trump is Hitler Galore, complete with Ayatollah Pence at his side. Stands to reason that this will be the main rhetorical thrust of the Democratic candidate, no? If you’re the last shot to save the nation from Hitlerian Hitlerism at its Hitlerest, you’d better not play nice.
But the current golden-boy duo of Beto-Buttigieg, which sounds like a wedding announcement in a Star Wars movie, are praised for their un-Trumpian tone. The positivity. The hope! That might work for people not inclined to pay attention to particulars. The people who want an angry ranter who denounces Trump for putting toddlers in cages and making them deny Science (in Russian) won’t be happy with a cotton-candy spinner.
They might have to pause in their denunciation of old gropey white males to tout the fierce necessity of Joe Biden. They might have to stop condemning the state for sending minorities to prison for drug matters to rally behind Kamala Harris. They might have to stop railing against hypocrite millionaires to back the Bern."
A Reflection on the Beginning of Spring | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Richard Brookhiser,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/stepping-to-spring/,"April 18, 2019 11:20 AM Spring in Central Park (Carlo Allegri/Reuters)
T he first step comes on New Year’s Day. I am very strict about this: There will be no belated Christmas trappings like hungover guests who collapsed in the coatroom. The ornaments come off, and the tree comes out of its stand and gets hoisted to the lawn. The sawn-off branches mulch the garden, the bare trunk gets pitched on the brush pile. Time also to take down the colored metal balls I hung on the potted pines by the front door, unless crows and jays have beat me to it, spiriting them away to their hordes of shiny objects.
The boughs we lay on the mantel, having no definite holiday significance, stay through the cold weeks, until time sucks all moisture out of them and a touch sends showers of needles to the floor. Taking them down is hand-prickling business. We once found, among the twigs, a mouse who had crept up, eaten juniper berries, and was no longer stirring. I stack the boughs in the fireplace and touch a match. A grate full of pine needles offers myriad surface areas; they blaze, and actually roar, like the last judgment. The orange afterglow lingers for minutes.
One step we used to take about this time was an addition, not a subtraction — hanging out two or four buckets to collect sap. When the sun is higher but the ground is still covered with snow, that is the time to rap spiles into the maple trunks and let the sap flow. It comes in drops, but it does not stop, like the ticking of a no-wind tree clock. The tink-tink sound is both pert and primal. Even the pure sap has a slight sweet tang, and the syrup, when you finally boil it down, is rich and wonderful. But the process of collecting and reducing is unrelenting; the ratio of sap to syrup is 40 to one. I am glad we did it for a couple of late winters; our friend Doug even made a custom label for our — one jug, or was it two? Now I am content to get my syrup from the retired prison guard who boils and bottles it professionally down the road.
Chipmunks appear. Squirrels we have always with us, their smaller striped neighbors hibernate. There comes a day though when the chipmunks are back, with their scraggly tails and their big babies’ eyes. They make squirrels look staid and slow-footed. I have not seen them yet this year. Have they caught some disease? Is there a cycle of which I am unaware? Did red squirrels, of which I have seen several, move in on their niche? I have 22 acres; something that weighs a couple of ounces can find its own niche. About the same time, or a little later, the colors in or on certain tree branches change. Willows brighten, the high-up tips of maples blush. The red of the maples is caused by a haze of tiny flowers, which precede the leaves. Look at them, they will soon be gone.
Next you take down the bird feeders. In the worst weather you were never without the company of the winter flock. There is food intelligence, if not safety, in numbers, and so they come together, making, I imagine, the rounds of other feeders in the neighborhood, in addition to mine. When I top up with a load of sunflower seeds, chickadees announce, the café car is open. Then come the juncos, bellies seemingly whitened from the snow they stick to, no-longer-gold finches, upside-down nuthatches, titmouses, sparrows, maybe some exotic that sends you to guidebooks — wait, did it have a spot on its breast? The male cardinal hangs back, as if traveling incognito. Why are you the color of a firetruck then? If they come before dawn, their footprints are their visitors’ cards. Bird was so unlucky as to find you still asleep. Thanks for the chow. But now there are bugs out, in the air, crawling on bark. The birds become simultaneously louder and elusive. They don’t need us anymore. Time to stack the suet logs on top of the cabinet over the washing machine, hose down the feeders, and store them in the shed.
Orion puts himself away. Ice melt and snow shovels go to the carport (but remember there is always an April storm). The rain barrels were drained last fall and covered with copper tops, to prevent freezing water from splitting their sides. Over the years weather and wet have turned the copper the many colors of the inside of a seashell. They now get picked up and stored away. If there is a charred fragment from the last cooking fire of this winter, I leave it in the fireplace to kindle the first fire of next winter.
All this time my wife, in addition to routine chores, has been doing actual planning and work, reading seed catalogues, placing orders, arranging the packets that arrive in the mail according to when we will place our bet on a harvest. "
Samuel Johnson & 'The Club' Book Review | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,John J. Miller,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/the-club-book-review-samuel-johnsons-world/,"April 18, 2019 11:05 AM A literary party at Sir Joshua Reynolds’ by D. George Thompson (National Portrait Gallery)
I n the famous dictionary he published in 1755, Samuel Johnson defined a “club” as “an assembly of good fellows, meeting under certain conditions.” Nine years later, in 1764, the lexicographer became a founder of the Club, with a capital C. Its good fellows met under these conditions: They gathered one evening each week near the Strand in London, where they took a private room at the Turk’s Head Tavern, ordered food and wine, and conversed about topics great and small. Members “had to be good company — ready to talk, laugh, drink, eat, and argue until late into the night,” writes Leo Damrosch in The Club , an ambitious, multi-part biography of their lives and times. Advertisement
The Club was no ordinary collection of drinking buddies. Rather, it represented an astonishing assembly of talent and accomplishment. Members included Johnson as well as James Boswell, Edmund Burke, Edward Gibbon, and Adam Smith. These five, according to Damrosch, were “arguably the greatest British critic, biographer, political philosopher, historian, and economist of all time.” The Club’s second-tier members also were extraordinary: David Garrick, the greatest actor of the age; Joshua Reynolds, a top painter; and Oliver Goldsmith and Richard Brinsley Sheridan, two of the era’s most successful playwrights. Men of this caliber of intellectual and cultural firepower have congregated only rarely, in places such as classical Athens, Renaissance Florence, and, coincidentally, in Philadelphia at roughly the same time as Johnson’s group.
Who wouldn’t want to eavesdrop on the Club’s conversations? Imagine Johnson and Garrick debating the art of Shakespeare. Or Boswell and Reynolds discussing the differences between written and visual portraiture. Or Burke and Smith — a pair of thinkers whose ideas echo loudly in today’s conservative movement — chatting about just about anything. That’s the implicit promise of Damrosch’s book. “The Club is the virtual hero of this story,” writes the author, a retired professor of literature at Harvard University. Yet this organizing principle turns out to be a curious weakness. Although the members of the Club left behind a massive record of books, essays, and speeches, almost nothing remains of what they said when they met in person. There are no transcripts. Only occasionally did one of them jot down the remarks of another. We have a star-studded cast, but there’s no script. Advertisement
Damrosch solves this problem by shifting his attention away from the specific activities of the Club and onto the amply documented friendship of Johnson and Boswell. They were an impressive duo, and The Club is essentially about them, with several tangents into the lives of their compatriots. This is well-trod ground, starting with Boswell’s own Life of Johnson and running through a long list of biographies that focus on one, the other, or the two together. Do we really need a new account of this old story? Perhaps. “When a man is tired of London, he is tired of life,” Johnson once said. It’s also hard to tire of Johnson, a dazzling wit who shaped the way we think about language and literature. Boswell, too, is a good subject. He was a pioneer in the art of biography and a dutiful diarist, whose revealing journals comprise more than a dozen volumes.
The world of Johnson is so rich that scholars have given it a name: Johnsoniana. There’s even a subfield: Boswelliana. Yet the map of their lives contains a few frustrating areas of terra incognita. Writers have had little to say about the friendship between Johnson and Burke, for example. Both were founding members of the Club, belonging to it for about a decade before Boswell, Gibbon, and Smith joined. They enjoyed a long connection, shared many interests, and were mutually admiring. Johnson was a hard man to impress, but he had the highest regard for Burke: “You could not stand five minutes with that man beneath a shed while it rained, but you must be convinced you had been standing with the greatest man you had ever seen.” The only thing that he may not have liked about his fellow Clubber was Burke’s fondness for groan-inducing puns. One time, for example, Burke sat near a ham. “I am Ham-Burke ,” he said, punning on the name of Hamburg, the German city. In recounting the incident, Damrosch says the most charitable thing possible: “You had to be there.” Advertisement Advertisement
This is the fundamental obstacle for any biographer who seeks to describe the friendship of Johnson and Burke: You had to have been there. They might have engaged in some of the greatest conversations in history, but we just don’t know, because conversations are ephemeral. Unless someone records them, they vanish like wisps of smoke. To compensate for their disappearance, Damrosch offers a brief biography of Burke, but it fails to show why Burke deserved Johnson’s profound admiration. Part of the problem may be Damrosch’s garden-variety liberalism. Today’s conservatives honor Burke as one of their intellectual heroes, largely for his authorship of Reflections on the Revolution in France , which warned against the chaos of mobs and the abandonment of tradition. Damrosch tries to push back, scolding American conservatives for having “idealized Burke as their foundational thinker” when the radical Thomas Paine mattered more to the Founding Fathers. Damrosch goes to great pains to make this point — or great Paines, to use a Burkean pun — but he seems unfamiliar with the writings of Peter Stanlis, Russell Kirk, and Yuval Levin. They’re nowhere in the footnotes, even though their work is indispensable to an understanding of Burke’s brand of conservatism and what American conservatives see in it. Advertisement Advertisement
Damrosch’s coverage of Smith is also a letdown, though in this case his characters hobble him. The introverted author of The Wealth of Nations was a “strangely recessive” member of the Club. When he was elected to it in 1775, Boswell, his former student in Edinburgh, grumbled that the Club had “lost its selective merit.” Johnson was sharper: Smith, he said, was “as dull a dog as he had ever met with.” The animosities at the Club extended to others as well: “Johnson and Boswell both loathed Gibbon,” writes Damrosch. In this instance, at least, their ire is rooted in disdain for what they perceived as anti-Christian views in Gibbon’s magnum opus, The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire . So here’s a substantial disagreement, and the prospect of rhetorical fireworks, but the fact remains that we just don’t know much about what Johnson, Boswell, and Gibbon said to one other at the Turk’s Head Tavern. Advertisement
With so little to report about what really happened at meetings of the Club, Damrosch turns not only to potted biographies of great men but also to what he calls Johnson’s “shadow club” or “second club.” This was the social circle that surrounded Hester Thrale, who became something of a patron to Johnson. She was also a devoted diarist, and if Boswell never had lived, her writings would serve as the favorite source of Johnson’s biographers. Even with Boswell’s biography, Thrale offers a unique contribution. Boswell, writes Damrosch, “felt a jealous rivalry with Hester for Johnson’s affection.” He essentially ignores her in The Life of Johnson , and she has much to say that Boswell doesn’t. Advertisement Advertisement
Thrale has provided anecdotes and insights into everything from Johnson’s method of composition to his mental health. He clearly suffered from what people in the 18th century called “melancholy.” Our word for it is “depression,” and Johnson’s case seems to have been severe. It may also be linked to his brilliance, making him a quintessential case of a tortured genius.
The torture was literal, according to Katharine C. Balderston, the editor of Thrale’s diary (known as — wait for it — Thraliana ). In 1949, Balderston described Johnson as a victim of “erotic maladjustment.” She continued: “His compulsive fantasy assumed a masochistic form, in which the impulse to self-abasement and pain predominated.” In other words, Mrs. Thrale padlocked Johnson and beat him with rods in acts of sexual perversion. Provocative claims require compelling proof, and in this case the evidence is thin. Most Johnson scholars have rejected it, including W. Jackson Bate, Peter Martin, and John Wain. Damrosch, however, accepts Balderston’s theory without hesitation. That’s fine, but beyond labeling her original article “controversial,” he doesn’t indicate to readers that this wild speculation is in fact a minority opinion.
Elsewhere, Damrosch makes better observations and wiser judgments. He marvels at the “remarkable” fluke that both Johnson and Garrick hailed from Lichfield, a small city near Birmingham, and they were buried beside each other in the Poets’ Corner of Westminster Abbey. Damrosch also endorses Johnson’s own belief that if he hadn’t quit Oxford for lack of funds, he might have disappeared into the mire of academia, never to be heard from again. Johnson instead moved to Grub Street, the traditional home of Londoners who scribbled for a living. Damrosch goes on to suggest that Johnson should have tried a medium that was just starting to catch on: “In hindsight it’s clear that the best path to success would have been as a novelist.” Unfortunately for fans of the novel, Johnson disliked the form.

Regarding “Neither Idol Nor Tool” (February 11): Here’s what, I think, Tucker Carlson meant in his critique of markets. Rather than bowing to GDP and the free market by offshoring factories, jobs, and supply chains to lower-cost locales, national leaders and policymakers should have tempered their fealty to the god of commerce with consideration for the national good. Carlson argues that the health of the family is a good proxy for the national good. In those terms, what you call “restrictions on trade” may prove salubrious. Retaining factories and jobs would certainly have proven to be “a great economic boon for Americans in [now] distressed communities.”
A similar framework can be used regarding Trump’s proposed changes to our current immigration processes, including asylum and border security. Has it been useful to our existing citizens, especially those at the lower wage rungs, to have millions of unvetted, low-educated workers competing in an increasingly slack labor market? Our national leaders and policymakers should have, rather, implemented policies supportive of our existing citizens and their dreams of starting and supporting families by responsibly limiting the waves of illegal migrants these past years. Blamoh Holmes Blue Ash, Ohio
Ramesh Ponnuru responds: While I am sympathetic to much of this commentary, I would caution that before imposing restrictions on trade to benefit American workers, we should make sure they actually will benefit American workers. Tariffs on steel in the past have injured many more Americans than they have helped, by inflicting harm on steel-using industries that employ more people than the steel industry does. Too often proposals on trade ignore these pitfalls.
Beliefs Can Go Bad
My very liberal aunt, chairwoman of the English department at UC Davis, gave me a subscription to NR in the late 1950s. I have been a subscriber ever since. Lately I have become disappointed in much of NR’s editorial slant.
An example is your paragraph (April 8) on the New Zealand massacre. I think you need to explain why you take it as a given that white nationalism is a creature of the Right. Perhaps you should carefully define exactly what it is that NR believes constitutes “the Right” that harbors white nationalism. James Bridges Lafayette, Calif.
The editors respond: Conservatism expresses, among other things, a reverence for community and custom. White nationalism is a demonic parody of this disposition."

Zahler is the writer and director of a series of extremely long, carefully composed, brutally violent movies, which have mostly had their life on video and on-demand. Each one has starred big names (Kurt Russell, Vince Vaughn) somewhat on the down side of their careers; the latest, Dragged across Concrete , stars Mel Gibson as a racist cop suspended for putting his foot on a suspect’s head, a casting move that naturally has created extra interest and controversy for the film. Advertisement Advertisement
Some of that attention has been dismissive, depicting Zahler as just a right-wing provocateur. But some has been more intriguing, and intrigued. “A singular, dangerous talent,” The Ringer ’s Scott Tobias called Zahler, while asking of his filmography: “How often are American viewers confronted by a movie that doesn’t need to be liked?”
The answer, in the age of blockbusters and algorithms and fan service, is not often. I had not watched any Zahler before his latest movie, so last week I watched Concrete back to back with Brawl in Cell Block 99 , his second effort, from 2017. (His first film, Bone Tomahawk , a pulp western in which Russell fights cannibals, I’m saving to watch on a completely empty stomach.) I can report that his films are not for the faint of heart, that they are politically incorrect without being politically didactic, that they have dialogue that wavers between pretension and perfection, and that they have an entirely distinctive and unapologetic style. Is that an endorsement? Yes, I think it is. Advertisement
Both movies are essentially pulp fiction, offered with Tarantino-esque enthusiasm for the grindhouse but without his irony or adolescent glee. Both are concerned with the conflict between bad men who have a code and bad men who are essentially satanic. In neither case do you get the Death Wish –style vigilante scenario in which a normal person is just pushed too far. Nobody has to push Zahler’s protagonists: They’re violent men who end up in dire situations because of their own mistakes and sins. Nor are their lives sentimentalized or their criminal chops admired. We are on their side only because they end up against something much worse than mere criminality and vice.
In Brawl , the protagonist, Bradley Thomas, is played by a looming, stoic, bald, and tattooed Vaughn: He’s a former boxer whom we first see destroying a car in rage over his wife’s infidelity, only to go inside and calmly decide that they should stay together and try to have another child. To support them, he becomes the muscle for a drug dealer, promising that it will be temporary, but by the time she gets pregnant it seems permanent. Then a deal goes wrong, and Vaughn’s character makes a moral but unwise choice, one that lands him in prison and in the crosshairs of a drug lord, who kidnaps his wife and threatens to have an abortionist maim their child in utero unless he figures out a way to get into the titular maximum-security cell block and murder someone held therein. Advertisement Advertisement
The violence that follows is substantial, since Vaughn’s character has to deal out considerable punishment just to get himself assigned to cell block 99. But the movie is also unusually at leisure — giving us a long introduction to prison-intake systems, allowing minor characters to flare and vanish without being strictly necessary to the plot. The dialogue is hard-boiled, writerly, sardonic, ultimately sincere.
The same habits are at work in Dragged across Concrete . Vaughn returns as Lurasetti, the junior partner to Gibson’s cop, Ridgeman, an aging detective who’s curdling into bigotry and brutality. Together they get suspended for the Gibson character’s not-terrible-but-still-excessive use of force; together they decide to rob a drug dealer (the older cop wants to move his family out of a bad neighborhood; the younger one is proposing to his too-smart-for-him girlfriend); together they end up dragged into a horror-show bank robbery carried out by psychopaths. Dragged with them is the alternative protagonist, Henry (Tory Kittles), a small-time hood hired as the getaway driver, trying to earn money to support his wayward mother and crippled kid brother. Dragged as well are a lot of innocents, to whom it would be unwise to become attached. Advertisement "
Kamala Harris Kind of Campaigns in Iowa | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,John Mccormack,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/magazine/2019/05/06/kamala-harris-kind-of-campaigns-in-iowa/,"April 18, 2019 11:35 AM (Roman Genn) But retail politics, so far, is not her thing Des Moines
K amala Harris is at the Mars Cafe, an environmentally conscious coffee shop on the edge of Drake University’s campus, to grab a coffee and meet some students for a photo op. When she places her order, Harris knows she wants an iced coffee but isn’t sure whether she should choose soy milk, almond milk, or oat milk to go with it. The barista helpfully has a recommendation: “Oat milk is the most sustainable of the alternative milks,” he says, later explaining that California’s almonds consume a considerable amount of resources. The California senator happily heeds the advice of the potential Iowa caucus-goer, perhaps becoming a little more enlightened along the way. Advertisement Advertisement
At the moment, Kamala Harris’s presidential campaign is a bit like oat milk: not exciting but potentially the most sustainable of the Democratic alternatives to front-runners Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders. Harris has faded somewhat in the polls since she first launched her campaign, while former Texas congressman Beto O’Rourke and South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg are taking their turns in the spotlight. Harris was in second place, at 18 percent, in an Iowa poll conducted by Emerson a week after she launched her campaign in late January. By the end of March, Emerson found that Harris had dropped to 10 percent and was sitting in fourth place in Iowa, behind, respectively, Biden, Sanders, and Buttigieg. (As of this writing, Biden has not announced that he is running.) At the same time, Harris’s $12 million fundraising haul for the first three months of 2019 bested that of every Democratic candidate in the field except Sanders.
Despite her dip in the polls, the case for Harris as the Democratic nominee remains compelling: Biden and Sanders are too old; O’Rourke and Buttigieg are too inexperienced. In the Goldilocks theory of the race, Kamala Harris is just right. The 54-year-old biracial first-term female senator checks almost every box, in terms of both intersectional identity politics and the progressive policy agenda, including Medicare for All and the Green New Deal. And she is cozy enough with the tech titans of Silicon Valley to raise lots of money. Harris is almost the perfect synthesis of the modern Democratic party. Advertisement
“If she was a stock right now, I’d buy her,” Jim Messina, Barack Obama’s presidential-campaign manager, said on MSNBC’s Morning Joe on April 11. Steve Bannon, Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign chief, told CNBC at the end of March that a Kamala Harris–Beto O’Rourke ticket would offer Democrats their “best shot” at defeating Trump in 2020.
Here inside the Mars Cafe, Lily Feiger, a junior studying politics at Drake, tells me she’s still undecided about which Democrat she’ll back in the 2020 caucuses. But she sees a lot to like in Harris. “I love her,” says Feiger. “I think she has what Hillary didn’t have. And I loved Hillary, and I think she was the most qualified candidate we’ve ever had ever. But I think she just wasn’t personable enough. And I think Kamala is.” Advertisement Advertisement
So why hasn’t Harris taken off in the polls? On the trail, the answer is pretty obvious: She’s running a scripted and methodical (you might even say boring) campaign focused on fundraising and policy proposals. Her latest big idea is $315 billion of federal spending to raise the salaries of public-school teachers.
While Beto O’Rourke crisscrossed Iowa, holding 23 events in March and April, Harris, according to the Des Moines Register , held zero events there in March and just two during her recent April trip (in addition to her unannounced trip to the Mars Cafe): a town hall at the University of Iowa that drew more than 900 attendees and a small house party at a supporter’s home in Des Moines.
“Right now, that’s fine, but sooner or later, she’s going to have to put the time in there to win it,” Joe Trippi, the veteran Democratic campaign consultant, tells National Review . Caucus-goers want to see the candidates up close, not just at a big rally or on TV. “You’ve got to do the retail politics of the state.” Trippi, who worked with top Harris strategist Ace Smith on Jerry Brown’s 2010 California gubernatorial race, says that Harris has built an impressive fundraising operation and campaign team. Advertisement
There has been some talk in the press that Harris might not actually need to win any of the February 2020 contests and that she can rely on her delegate-rich home state of California, which moved up its primary to March 3, as a firewall. But history suggests that would be a foolish strategy; ask Rudy Giuliani and Marco Rubio how their “Florida firewall” held up in the 2008 and 2016 GOP primaries. Polling also casts doubt on that tactic: A Quinnipiac survey in April found Harris in third place, behind Biden and Sanders, respectively, in the Golden State. “To a lot of Californians, she is still a cipher,” Bill Whalen, of the California-based Hoover Institution, tells me. Whalen notes that Bernie Sanders has about 100,000 donors in California. Advertisement Advertisement
“I think they know they’ve got to win South Carolina,” Trippi says of the Harris campaign. “But I think they also know they’ve got to score before then — a third, or a second,” depending on who would come in ahead of Harris. The Democratic party awards delegates on a proportional basis, but the early states will still have their traditional effect of shaping the race. Would Barack Obama’s national coalition have come together in 2008 if he hadn’t won Iowa? “No way,” Trippi says. Advertisement
Political operatives and pundits have called Harris the “female Obama” since before she was first elected as California’s attorney general in 2010, a label that Harris has long dismissed in the way that a star college quarterback might dismiss comparisons to Tom Brady — just enough to provide a passing attempt at humility.
On the campaign trail, however, the comparison between Obama and Harris does indeed seem inapt. Obama was famous for his soaring and inspirational speeches. Harris seems to consciously reject “hope and change” rhetoric. On the stump, Obama boldly and vaguely declared, “We are the ones we’ve been waiting for.” The peroration of Harris’s stump speech is modest: “We are better than this.”
“For those of us who speak behind a microphone or behind a podium, there’s an incentive that we will make everyone feel lovely — sprinkle lovely dust all over the room, and everyone will applaud, and [the] job will have been done. Well, speaking truth doesn’t always accomplish that goal,” Harris told the crowd gathered at the Des Moines house party on April 11. Yet the plainspoken truths Harris then delivers don’t seem all that bold: the need for a $6,000 middle-class tax cut, for boosting the average teacher’s pay by $12,200, and for renewing the Federal Assault Weapons Ban. Advertisement
Harris seems to assiduously avoid making unwanted headlines. The one exception during her trip to Iowa was her explanation of why she owns a handgun, and it was the only comment widely picked up by national press. “I own a gun for probably the reason that a lot of people do — for personal safety. I was a career prosecutor,” Harris told reporters after the party. A Harris-campaign spokesperson would not tell National Review whether her firearm is a semiautomatic, like most handguns. In a general election, Harris’s gun could reassure millions of fellow gun owners, but right now she is trying to win over progressive voters, some of whom would like to see all semiautomatic weapons banned.
Another fun-house-mirror effect of the Democratic primary is that her biggest vulnerability is the charge that she was an overzealous prosecutor. She supported a law that mandated jail time for parents of chronically truant children, and she faces allegations of working to uphold wrongful convictions. But in a general election, one of her biggest weaknesses would be the charge that she was too soft on crime.
As San Francisco district attorney, Harris declined to seek the death penalty for a man who had murdered police officer Isaac Espinoza with an AK-47 in 2004. At Espinoza’s funeral, Democratic senator Dianne Feinstein called on Harris to seek the death penalty and received a standing ovation from police officers in attendance. “This is not only the definition of tragedy, it’s the special circumstance called for by the death-penalty law,” Feinstein said. California enacted a law in 1977 allowing the death penalty only in special circumstances, including when a police officer is murdered. In early April of this year, Espinoza’s widow spoke on camera for the first time. “She did not call me,” Renata Espinoza said of Harris in a tearful interview with CNN. “I felt like she had just taken something from us. She had just taken justice from us.” "
William Barr Press Conference: No Obstruction on the Facts | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Andrew C.

McCarthy on Twitter April 18, 2019 11:43 AM Attorney General William Barr, flanked by Edward O’Callaghan and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, at a news conference to discuss Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report, in Washington, D.C., April 18, 2019. (Jonathan Ernst/Reuters) Understanding the disagreement between Barr and Mueller
T he most interesting new disclosure to come out of Attorney General William Barr’s press conference on the Mueller report was about obstruction of justice.
As I pointed out in a Fox News column this morning, the obstruction issue was one of the main reasons why the media-Democrat complex’s caterwauling about Barr’s unremarkable decision to hold a press conference was ludicrous. Special Counsel Mueller declined to render a prosecutorial judgment on whether obstruction charges should be brought against the president. Since it is the attorney general who made the judgment, for that reason alone it was worth hearing from him this morning. Advertisement Advertisement
The attorney general stated that the special counsel evaluated ten incidents with an eye toward whether they amounted to an obstruction offense. Barr elaborated that he and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein disagreed with Mueller on whether these incidents even could have amounted to obstruction as a matter of law.
It is important to grasp what that means, and what it doesn’t, because I’ve heard some inaccurate commentary. Barr was not saying that Mueller found one or more of these incidents to constitute obstruction; Mueller was saying that the incidents involved actions that could theoretically have amounted to obstruction.
A concrete example may make this easier to grasp: the firing of FBI director James Comey. Before a prosecutor considered evidence regarding that incident, there would be a preliminary question: Could the president’s dismissal of an FBI director amount to an obstruction offense as a matter of law? If prosecutors were to decide that, even if the evidence showed corrupt intent on the part of the president, a president’s firing of the FBI director cannot constitutionally amount to an obstruction crime, then the prosecutors would not bother to investigate and make an assessment of the evidence. Advertisement Advertisement
What Barr is saying is that he and Mueller did not agree, with respect to all ten incidents, on whether the incident could legally amount to obstruction. What the attorney general therefore did was assume, for argument’s sake, that Mueller was correct on the law (i.e., that the incident could theoretically amount to obstruction), and then move on to the second phase of the analysis: Assuming this could be an obstruction offense as a matter of law, could we prove obstruction as a matter of fact ? This requires an assessment of whether the evidence of each element of an obstruction offense – most significantly, corrupt intent – could be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.
That is why Barr laid out the facts that the president could have shut down the investigation but did not; that he could have asserted executive privilege to withhold information from the investigation, but instead made numerous witnesses and well over a million documents available to the special counsel; and that – reportedly according to Mueller – the president sincerely felt frustrated that the investigation was unfairly undermining his presidency. The point is that these facts so cut against the idea of corruptly impeding an investigation that it is inconceivable the prosecutor could prove an obstruction case beyond a reasonable doubt.

The Eighties: A Sequel | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Peter Tonguette,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/magazine/2019/05/06/the-eighties-a-sequel/,"April 18, 2019 11:36 AM Henry Thomas in E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (Universal Studios) To judge by recent pop culture, we miss the decade
W hy would you want to purchase a book with a ragged dust jacket and stained pages? More to the point, why would a publisher release a book in which those defects were not the result of use but built into the product?
If you don’t know the answer to those questions, you are unlikely to be an adherent of the current craze for pop culture produced in the 1980s. The book in question, published last fall by the Random House imprint Del Rey Books, is an utterly remarkable object: Stranger Things: Worlds Turned Upside Down bills itself as the authoritative guide to the almost universally well-liked Netflix series depicting assorted supernatural phenomena in 1980s-era suburbia. Advertisement Advertisement
The book, though, comes close to matching the series for nostalgia value. The publisher must have recognized that it was not enough for the book merely to be about a series set in the ’80s — it had to somehow be of the ’80s. The inside design is spot-on — the chunky, wide typefaces used for headings are instantly identifiable as dating from the decade in question — but even more on point is the intentional wear and tear. The dust jacket — torn on the spine and at the edges — is itself encased in a transparent jacket cover, a touch evocative of a public-library tag sale from, say, 1987. Stamped on the cover is an orange sticker from “Melvald’s General Store,” on which this presumably secondhand book’s condition is identified: “FAIR.” For those who aren’t in on the joke, the publisher helpfully provides a disclaimer. “Don’t freak!” the message reads. “This book is supposed to look worn and torn.”
That says it all, doesn’t it? Stranger Things: Worlds Turned Upside Down may represent the ne plus ultra of ’80s nostalgia, but it is one of countless pop-culture products that seek to replicate the stuff we read, watched, and listened to in the ninth decade of the 20th century. Tapping into the same audience that helped resurrect vinyl records, Mill Creek Entertainment’s “Retro VHS” Blu-ray line — including the Chuck Norris thriller Silent Rage (1982) and the John Candy comedy Who’s Harry Crumb? (1989) — presents Blu-ray discs packaged to suggest beat-up VHS boxes. Blockbuster Video may be dead, but its spirit lives on. Advertisement
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez speaks contemptuously of the politics of Ronald Reagan, but, as was made clear in the video footage in which the future congresswoman danced in the style of the cast of 1985’s The Breakfast Club , even she is not immune to the charms of the ’80s. You don’t have to be a Young Republican to be a fan of the entertainment choices available during the Gipper’s presidency. How else to explain the popularity of not just Stranger Things but also the 2017 film version of Stephen King’s It (which, like Stranger Things , meticulously recreated an ’80s-era neighborhood) or Nintendo’s NES Classic Edition? It is a fair bet that many of Ocasio-Cortez’s constituents, like the rest of America, eagerly await Jason Reitman’s sequel to Ghostbusters , which promises not to break in tone or spirit with the original version from 1984. And I wonder: Would Lori Loughlin’s indictment in the still-unfolding college-cheating scandal make such headlines if the actress had not been a staple on the ultimate lame ’80s sitcom, Full House ? Advertisement
Signs of the pending ’80s mania came as early as 2001 — a mere eleven years after the ’80s came to a close! — with the release of Richard Kelly’s stellar supernatural flick Donnie Darko , which, for reasons that could not be justified dramatically, was set in 1988. In the opening sequence, Donnie (Jake Gyllenhaal) takes to his bicycle to navigate his residential streets — shades of Elliott and company in Steven Spielberg’s E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982) — while his mother curls up with a fat hardcover edition of (you guessed it) King’s It . During dinner, the Darko clan hashes out the looming presidential election; Donnie’s sister (Maggie Gyllenhaal) expresses her preference for Dukakis. Advertisement
The craze was confirmed in 2010, when the late writer-director John Hughes — who churned out such ’80s-era favorites as The Breakfast Club and Ferris Bueller’s Day Off (1986) — was given a royal send-off at the Academy Awards. During a tribute unfolding over a staggering six and a half minutes, former teen stars including Molly Ringwald and Anthony Michael Hall tipped their hat to the man who catapulted them to fleeting celebrity. That Hughes was never honored with an Oscar nomination, let alone a win, was tactfully overlooked; all that mattered were the warm and fuzzy feelings his films conjured. Few could miss the fact that major historical revisionism was under way, as it continues to be. The 1987 Goldie Hawn farce Overboard was long considered a debacle of Ishtar -level proportions, but when the film was revived last year as a vehicle for Anna Faris, numerous outlets — including Variety , which should know better — described it as a “classic.” Perversely, the ineptitude of the new Overboard made the old Overboard look better.
Indeed, the current ’80s mania is on some level nothing more than a matter of aesthetics. Even those who did not live through the decade or do not have conscious memory of it can recognize the solid craftsmanship of Amy Heckerling’s Fast Times at Ridgemont High (1982) or Richard Donner’s The Goonies (1985), or the retro appeal of old-school book and VHS covers. Yet, if we go back to the mass entertainment that prompts our present feelings of nostalgia, a more complicated picture emerges. Simply put: Many movies and TV shows made during that decade ought to be celebrated — not for their elements of rad design but for their surprising wholesomeness. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement
Gone were the soul-searching sensitivity of James Dean in Rebel without a Cause (1955) and the aimless intensity of Jack Nicholson in Easy Rider (1969). Instead, the ’80s gave us a new sort of screen hero: well-adjusted teenagers who, snug and secure in their well-appointed homes, seemed to embody the energy and enthusiasm of Reagan’s “morning in America.” Think of Tom Cruise’s entrepreneur-in-training in Risky Business (1983) or Corey Haim’s automobile-obsessed youth in License to Drive (1988). Meanwhile, in the Back to the Future series and on the sitcom Family Ties , Michael J. Fox proved that by-the-books ordinariness could be popular with audiences, too.
In fact, rare was the ’80s teen comedy in which the traditional family unit was presented as anything but a positive, or at least benign, force. Ferris Bueller’s Day Off features the hero (Matthew Broderick) evading all forms of authority, but he has no particular animus toward his elders; after all, the elaborate sound-effects system through which he fools his father is installed in his bedroom in his parents’ home! And, in the surprisingly sharp and funny License to Drive , Corey Haim flouts all the rules in his pursuit of wheels, but he is situated firmly within the constellation of a family, including his assertive but tolerant dad (Richard Masur), his daffy, pregnant mom (Carol Kane), and a pair of harmless siblings. This is a family in harmony, more or less. Even when Dad is a Wally World–obsessed fool, like Chevy Chase in the Vacation string of comedies, the family most often ends up where they started: together. Advertisement
Significantly, a family lacking in two parents was usually seen as a deficit in the cinema of the ’80s. For example, E.T. — a far richer film than anything by John Hughes, let alone License to Drive — touchingly depicts the unavoidable struggles of single motherhood. After her husband has flown the coop, Mary (Dee Wallace) is left to rear her three children, Elliott (Henry Thomas), Michael (Robert MacNaughton), and Gertie (Drew Barrymore). Alas, Mary’s grip on her kids’ comings and goings is so tenuous that she is the last to know of the presence of a space alien in her home. Released two years after E.T. , Michael Apted’s Firstborn goes a step further in chronicling the hazards a single mother (Teri Garr) exposes her brood to when she tests the dating waters with a no-good guy (Peter Weller). Advertisement
That is not to suggest that the decade was all sanctimony or devoid of wit. In Gremlins (1984) and The ’Burbs (1989), director Joe Dante had fun upending our ideas about small towns and cul-de-sacs; the former film remains forever distinguished by the extraordinary monologue in which Phoebe Cates recounts the circumstances of the death of her father, who, while donning a Santa Claus costume one Christmas, accidentally lodged himself in the chimney. Hearth and home were sent up in George Roy Hill’s Funny Farm (1988), but — guess what? — the urbanites at the center of the film (Chevy Chase and Madolyn Smith) ended up staying in Redbud after all.
By the same token, Tobe Hooper’s Poltergeist (1982) has been said to revolve around suburban sprawl — after all, the family in the film has the misfortune of having their house built on what was once an Indian graveyard — but, in the end, the film makes no challenge to the bonds of family. In the final scene, when dad Craig T. Nelson deposits his family in a Holiday Inn and tosses out the television set, he is striking a blow for strong, decisive fathers everywhere. Traditional movie tough guys were fading from the screen — Steve McQueen almost bridged the gap in his last film, The Hunter (1980), playing a flinty, competent bounty hunter who reluctantly partakes in his pregnant girlfriend’s Lamaze exercises — but there were still allowances made for such male authority figures as Sam Elliott in Mask (1985) or Sean Connery (as Indiana Jones’s old-school, disciplinarian dad) in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989)."

Williamson,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/big-business-tyler-cowens-compelling-case-for-large-corporations/,"About Kevin D. Williamson April 18, 2019 10:31 AM Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos laughs during the grand opening at Amazon’s headquarters in Seattle, Wash., January 29, 2018. (Lindsey Wasson/Reuters) Big Business: A Love Letter to an American Anti-Hero , by Tyler Cowen (St. Martin’s Press, 272 pp., $28.99)
P rofessor Tyler Cowen of George Mason University and the Mercatus Center — and Marginal Revolution , and the New York Times , and much else — is consistently one of the most interesting and original thinkers on human affairs that our public discourse has to offer. He is an economist, but an economist who understands economics in the very broad sense of praxeology — “human action,” as Ludwig von Mises put it. And so you can read Cowen on street food in Singapore; the “market underpricing of autistic labor”; art collecting (his review of Doug Woodham’s Art Collecting Today contains this quibble: the author “should have done much more to explain how art is used for money laundering, and also tax arbitrage through donations at inflated prices, based on corrupt appraisals”); and, from time to time, on more straightforwardly economic questions as such. Advertisement
Professor Cowen has a reputation as a contrarian, but that is not exactly right. He has a great talent for revealing truths that are right under our noses but oddly overlooked — or willfully obscured. His latest book, Big Business: A Love Letter to an American Anti-Hero , is an excellent, easily digestible exercise in exactly that. Why is it, he asks, that Big Business is not more widely admired and appreciated? Large-scale corporate enterprises provide a great many jobs; relative to smaller firms, they typically pay their workers more and treat them better, invest more in research and development, are more productive and more innovative, and conduct their business at least as ethically. He knocks down a series of myths about excessive executive compensation, “quarterly capitalism” obsessed with short-term profits, monopolistic temptations, and the purportedly outsize role of finance in our economy.
On the last of those, Professor Cowen offers one of his extraordinarily useful, obvious-if-you-think-about-it insights: The argument that finance has grown too large as a share of U.S. economic activity is based in part on the fact that in the 1960s finance accounted for about 4 percent of GDP whereas it recently has been above 8 percent. That’s the wrong comparison, he argues: Finance is engaged in the business of managing wealth, not in the business of managing current income flows exclusively; it makes more sense, then, to examine the share of assets that the financial sector controls, which, as is turns out, has not changed very much over the years, floating around 2 percent. While other social critics have written great volumes about “financialization” — where it comes from, what it means, whether it is desirable — Professor Cowen first stops to ask whether the thing that everybody knows is happening is in fact happening.
Big Business is particularly useful at the intersections of these questions. For example, the belief that CEOs are paid too much is closely linked with the belief that corporations are excessively and unproductively oriented toward the short-term concern of quarterly reports and share prices. But the evidence does not support that conclusion. The reality is that firms undertaking aggressive and in the end unprofitable expansions into China were, like many investors in technology start-ups, suffering from excessively long-term thinking and
failed to be hardheaded enough about short-term limitations. Tesla in 2017 achieved a higher market value than either Ford or General Motors, even though there are no visible signs that the company is capable of selling electric cars at an affordable price for a profit. . . . You can see the same kind of price spikes with a lot of biotech stocks, often before they have brought their products to market.
From where I sit right now in 2018, I don’t know which of these high valuations are the mistakes, and that is part of the point — most critics don’t either. But for sure, in many of these cases the market is thinking too long-term and should be worried about the lack of revenue today. More generally, price-to-earnings ratios are historically high. . . . My point is that these currently high P/E ratios are directly inconsistent with the charge of excess short-termism. In essence the price has been high because the market is expecting high forthcoming earnings, not because earnings are high enough today to justify those valuations.
He goes on to consider the case of Amazon and Jeff Bezos, who has become the wealthiest man in the world while famously forgoing short-term profitability goals in favor of reinvesting revenue in the company and its remarkably ambitious long-term strategy. He notes that in 2015, the average Fortune 500 CEO had been in his job for eleven years, the longest average tenure in more than a decade. And CEO compensation increasingly is performance-based, with pay structures that reward the achievement of long-term goals: Very few billion-dollar fortunes are built on salaries and quarterly bonuses Advertisement
Professor Cowen has a great gift for simplification. His subject here includes complex and nuanced questions of economics and business organization, but his presentation of them is perfectly lucid. In an introductory note to his famous Brief History of Time , Stephen Hawking relayed his publisher’s observation that every equation in the book would cost him half his readers. Professor Cowen here spares the reader equations and most economic and financial jargon: If you can read the Wall Street Journal , nothing in this book will prove esoteric. Advertisement Advertisement
The book does have a slightly catalogue-ish feel to it, as though Professor Cowen has been (as I suspect) keeping a list of college students’ most common complaints about Big Business (and about capitalism generally) and addressing them in series: “Are the Big Tech Companies Evil?” “What Is Wall Street Good for, Anyway?” “How Monopolistic Is American Big Business?” Etc. It goes: Here you go. Next? Here you go. Next? Not boom . There is nothing of the cable-news/social-media mode of discourse here, and there is no temptation to write “Tyler Cowen DESTROYS!” . . . this or that argument. If it seems like the book does not build to a dramatic conclusion, that is because the case is pretty clear from the beginning.
In fact, Professor Cowen’s approach to these questions as a matter of argumentation is, while neither fussy nor even formal, pleasantly anachronistic. Another way of putting that is to say that he is unusually evenhanded and intellectually honest. Of course, there is plenty of evidence that runs contrary to his theme: Big businesses and their executives sometimes do awful things. (But are they more unethical than the rest of us ? Cowen asks.) He is forthright on the issue of crony capitalism, noting, for instance, oil companies’ tolerance (or encouragement) of corruption in badly governed African countries. He does not attempt to explain away real abuses but puts them in context: “On the whole, American corporations would rather invest in Canada than in Bhutan or Cameroon, and that is a more important reality than any stack of anecdotes.”
The book offers a good return on investment, even when its conclusions and sense of proportion seem not quite right. There are certain homogenizing effects of Big Business that are of immediate present concern, and Professor Cowen is a good deal more comfortable than I am with Silicon Valley’s emerging role as global arbiter of political speech (and other kinds of speech). He asks important questions about our relationship with our employers (“is work fun?”) but is more blasé than he might be about the cultural consequences of employment’s growing role as a locus of meaning, especially when the corporation is being programmatically transformed into an explicit instrument of political and social discipline. Perhaps these issues are not as easily treated with economic argument. Or perhaps Professor Cowen thinks better of general corporate culture than some less generous observers do. Consider his observations on monopoly power:
The American economy today does have some pretty notable superfirms. At the time of writing the list would include Google, Facebook, Amazon, Walmart, Apple, Exxon, the major auto companies, United Health, CVS, and AT&T, to name just a few. "
A Letter to My Irish Father | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Michael Brendan Dougherty,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/a-letter-to-my-irish-father/,"For men improve with the years; And yet, and yet, Is this my dream, or the truth? O would that we had met When I had my burning youth! — “Men Improve with the Years,” W. B. Yeats
D ear Father,
We feel like we are getting to know this child already, the way she turns over or dances for us as the doctor shakes her awake to observe her on the ultrasound. We’re in for it, they tell us, about parenthood. We are getting tired of everyone warning us that the struggles of a new baby will leave us so tired. War metaphors abound. Other parents are “veterans” on their way back from the front lines. An adorable tiny rocking hammock is recast as “the essential weapon” to deploy. If it’s a battle to raise a child, we need reinforcements. Advertisement
I suppose we get reinforcement. Not only extended family and friends, but the larger culture raises and forms our children, whether you’d want it or not. A home is a refuge, but it still sits within something larger, a homeland or a culture. In your absence, my mother had given me familiarity with Ireland’s story and the high ideals of its national history. And then this larger culture around us began to deconstruct that story, and it nudged me along in efforts to deconstruct that national mythology as well. Deconstruction of this sort was just the thing to do.
A culture is a funny thing. Somehow it is this collective personality that is constantly feeding you information about itself. It ranks and re-ranks everything in life — people, objects, and ideas. It turns articles of clothing into symbols of high or low status. It suggests certain ideas and dismisses others. Its judgments become so familiar that it exists like a voice in your head. And yet it is impossible to explain exactly how this happens. Advertisement
A culture feeds you even the terms on which you would resist it. The culture that encouraged me to deconstruct the ideals and taboos of Ireland’s past because they have “an unhealthy hold upon the living” was the same culture that told me that by doing so, by doing what everyone else was doing, I was defining life on my own terms, and for myself. Advertisement
So what were our background cultures? Our boyhoods could not have been more different. You had five siblings and two parents at home. You grew up in a tight two-up, two-down in Donnycarney and the streets had hundreds of children in them. The schools that were built to handle this were called “industrial.” One of the most infamous of these, Artane, cast its shadow into your neighborhood. In summers you were sent to your grandparents in Monaghan, to avoid the training in criminality available just out your door. Fathers were deputized by God to rule their homes. The Catholic Church of your youth was a spiritual empire, sending Irish emissaries across the sea. It spoke Latin, threw incense generously, and ran the world as you knew it, because the unquenchable fire of hell burbled beneath everything. People you knew would be genuinely afraid of receiving Holy Communion unworthily.
The heroes of Ireland’s Easter Rising were still venerated as saints. When you were a child, Ireland’s president, a hero of that rebellion, laid a wreath at the jail where his comrades were condemned to death and killed. The life of the nation was serious business. The adult world throbbed with authority and frequently abused it. Maybe Ireland would be poor, but it would be sanctified and creative. This was what one of Ireland’s leading writers calls the myth of Holy Catholic Ireland, a myth that shaped your childhood. A myth that Ireland has spent the last three decades dismantling. The last artifacts of it are eagerly chucked away. Advertisement
That world was as distant from mine as medieval France is. I grew up an only child with a single mother. I lived in a series of American suburbs, each seemingly more prosperous than the next. There were dozens of kids in the neighborhoods, not hundreds, and nothing as exciting as criminality. The Church was a friendly ghost. Nobody feared approaching for Communion. God would be merciful, surely. If you were unusually curious and asked about the apparent change of attitude, you would be assured that many theologians thought hell was empty. Advertisement
When I was a child the nation’s president disclosed to us his preference in underwear for a laugh. The adult world that I encountered was plainly terrified of having authority over children and tried to exercise as little of it as practicable. At every turn my mother, my teachers, and the Church just sort of gave up and gave in to whatever I wanted. They seemed grateful when a child wasn’t difficult. The constant message of authority figures was that I should be true to myself. I should do what I loved, and I could love whatever I liked. I was the authority. In the benighted past somewhere, there was pain and misery, but Baby Boomers had largely corrected this for us in their titanic generational battles. This I would call the myth of liberation. I was raised on this mythology, and it ordered the world around me. The future ought to be bright. This was the end of history, and wasn’t it good? Advertisement
A t the spiritual level, this myth of liberation — a liberation already accomplished — made my generation into powerless narcissists. We worshiped authenticity — being your true self — even as most of us accused ourselves, in our own hearts, of being frauds. Some of us fell into despair and chemical dependency. Others coped through dual membership in the cults of productivity and therapeutic self-care. A few turned to Internet father figures who told them that life is struggle, that it is defined by self-assertion and dominance. And some, tired of trying to find a motive for existence from within, turned to political radicalism. But all this wreckage was a decade or more away from me and my friends then. We had no idea what was coming. Depression? Economically, we were assured it was unlikely to ever come again. Personally? Well, there were new drugs for it. Advertisement Advertisement
And my mother was increasingly on those drugs. When my grandmother died, my mother lost her role as the dutiful daughter. And she could see that in a few years I would also fly from home. Where would it leave her? I experienced the 1990s as a coming into my own, as the world opening up for me. My mother experienced something else. Her life shrank. She didn’t travel as much. She tried to make arrangements to move us to London, where she had been so happy once. But she shelved them.
There was a great deal of talk at that time about the heroism of single mothers, but not all the taboos were pulled down. She had stuck it out with the baby, assured that the world would increasingly accept, and admire, her decision. In truth, it did so only provisionally. IBM would not and then could not fire her for being a single mother. But her form of life as mother, often overworked due to her circumstances, had none of the honor and understanding that is extended to widows, whom everyone feels obliged to help generously. This state of life was what she chose, after all. Or people would retain the suspicion that she must be at fault somehow, that she had failed to keep the man for a reason. Her form of being single was impaired by motherhood, having none of the real freedom and allure of those who were truly unattached. I would later discover that she had admirers and even lovers, but she could — or would — never make them into committed boyfriends or suitors. Advertisement
As depression set in, she gained weight and became more frequently ill. I heard people worry for her, saying that she was “letting herself go.” She was. She lived on the other side of the culture’s liberation, and her unhappiness in life was held to be her fault. The cliché about lying in the bed you have made for yourself became her reality. She had finally thrown away the old couch and pullout for a real, proper queen-sized bed. But now she slept in it constantly. It was as if the culture had slipped her its real judgment in secret, the cruel truth that was unspeakable in public. And she accepted that judgment and internalized it.
Late in high school I grew close to an English teacher, Mr. Scanlon. He was the most important in a long succession of substitute father figures. In the long run, I suppose, he was giving me a livelihood. He was also a man with Irish roots. Knowing my background, he began feeding my imagination with W. B. Yeats, the Pogues, and James Joyce. “Who goes with Fergus?” he asked as he bounded into a room. He played “Bottle of Smoke” while we edited the school’s literary magazine, and he filled my world with sad, colorful Dubliners .
In a way, the clatter of Irish music, the strangeness of the Irish sky, and a repository of Ireland’s national genius were all returned to me, not as an inheritance to be treasured and passed on, but as ornaments of a life defined by enjoyment, consumption. And this curator’s approach seemed to let me enjoy them safely. That little bit of ironic distance prevented these things from really touching the parts of my soul and mind that were vulnerable to developing a deep conviction.
You say your father prayed five decades of the rosary with the family each day. At night, your four sisters would file into one bedroom. You and your brother would come in to sleep in the same room with your parents. Your father would climb into bed and pray five decades of the rosary again with your mother. Years later, in the old-folks’ home, when nurses and orderlies offended his sense of modesty, he would rage and struggle in his dementia. But these angels attending him learned to just shout the beginning of a prayer. Instantly, the rage subsided, as he started his stiff, ceremonious sign of the cross and joined them in prayer. For you and the usual audiences for the story, the image is funny. For me, it has become something else. In a world where everything is plastic, everything is unserious, this adamantine stubbornness feels like a shelter. Advertisement
Yet you remain heathen. Even with all the aid of cruel, holy Ireland and a father willing to drill you in The Penny Catechism , which discloses the purpose of life and the mysteries of religion in precisely 740 English sentences: “Who made you?” “God made me.”
I n college, the 1916 Easter Rising came back to me as well, in history classes where I was advantaged by childhood familiarity with the rebels’ names, their views, and their deeds. The hardline historical revisionists had the courage to take those rebels seriously, alternately detesting and pitying their subjects. But as time went on, with a little distance from the Troubles, with the Celtic Tiger in full swing, the rebels’ views became somehow muted and less threatening, and before long no one even offered them the dignity of hating them. Instead of being celebrated or reviled, the rebels were given back to me as trivia and kitsch. James Connolly had died convinced that the causes of Ireland and labor were intertwined, but modern and free Ireland was lately hailed as a capitalist miracle. Patrick Pearse had believed that Ireland could win a place among sovereign and free nations by reclaiming the creative energy still existing in its Irish-speaking culture, but the great power in Irish culture today is English and American media, and the nation’s lifeblood is found in the creative way America’s tech giants wring continental profits through Irish tax loopholes. Aspiration after aspiration had proven idealistic and naïve, so we hung the idealists’ faces on the walls of the local pub as decoration and made them watch Irish America’s version of Erin Go Puke every Paddy’s Day. Having them around was like an inside joke about how irrelevant they were.
Your generation makes a different kind of joke about the Rising. I’ve seen it when you’re in St. Sylvester’s Gaelic Athletic Association club. Maybe a man with a Kerry accent toasts a local singer for his rebel song and his Sinn Féin politics. You put on your thickest Dublin accent, asking, “And where were youse when we was doing all the fighting?” As if you yourself, as a Dub, inherit the reputation of having fought in the Rising and all these culchies inherit the guilt of having sat out Ireland’s great hour. When you joke like this, the humor is a backward way of paying tribute to the real thing. The self-deprecation inherent in it is like an act of humility, even gratitude.
What I mean by the Rising becoming kitsch for me is that in my generation, our joke would be to say anything is serious at all. The idea that events and ideals have real meaning, that something outside of ourselves deserves our loyalty, is what’s ridiculed. We think this aloofness makes us look unflappable, that it even grants us a certain austere dignity. But it really just makes us satisfied with remaining shallow. We call the higher ideals a form of narrowness, and shrink away from them. Keep an open mind, play the options in front of you. Be smart. Aloof is the safe bet.
But aloofness misleads us. This ironic distance is insufficient when we are really tested. I notice that Sir Roger Casement is now one of the few leaders of the Rising whom Ireland can praise without equivocation. Born in Ireland, he went into British-imperial service. He became something like the first modern human-rights activist, after documenting the abuses of Belgium in the Congo. Gradually he embraced the Irish national cause. Caught off the coast of Kerry trying to deliver weapons from Germany ahead of the Rising, he was tried for treason. Britain exposed his “black diaries,” which detailed his sexual preoccupation with young men. And now, I read many articles about how he foreshadowed this more inclusive Ireland. In a recent biography, the author tried to cast him as fully modern in his sensibilities. And at some times in his life, he did take the modern view of things, including religion. He wrote to a friend, “There can be no heaven if we don’t find it and make it here and I won’t barter this sphere of duty for a hundred spheres and praying wheels elsewhere.” And yet that sense of duty eventually carried him beyond what was safe and modern.
In his prison cell, awaiting certain death, he decided he would convert to Catholicism. The archbishop demanded that he recant his Irish nationalism. He refused. But the priests attending him said that he died “with all the faith and piety of an Irish peasant woman.”
He wrote a letter explaining himself.
Ireland alone went forth to assail evil, as David Goliath, unarmed, save with a pebble, and she has slain, I pray to God, the power and boast and pride of Empire. That is the achievement of the boys of 1916, and on it the living shall build a sterner purpose, and bring it to a greater end. If I die tomorrow bury me in Ireland, and I shall die in the Catholic Faith, for I accept it fully now. It tells me what my heart sought long in vain — in Protestant coldness I could not find it — but I saw it in the faces of the Irish. Now I know what it was I loved in them — the chivalry of Christ speaking through human eyes — it is from that source the lovable things come, for Christ was the first Knight. And now my beloved ones goodbye — this is my last letter from the condemned cell. I write it always with hope — hope that God will be with me to the end and that all my faults and failures and errors will be blotted out of the Divine Knight — the Divine Nationalist.
These Irish men and women of the Rising and the struggle against England in the years afterward were modern people, which is to say that they were people who could be easily labeled and analyzed by professional historians and our intellectual caste. Their social position could be vivisected: They were a typical revolutionary generation, a rising class of educated people who would be excluded from normal positions of power absent a major shake-up. Their writings and thoughts can be easily tagged — Victorian Gaels, 19th-century nationalists, progressive educationists — and then filed away. And yet they had done something that modern people should no longer be able to do in a world of trench warfare, gas attacks, and mass-mechanized death. They became legends. They lived on this edge of life, where aloofness was burned away until some greater conviction emerged.
I n quieter moments you have said that you wished you could believe, you just don’t. And I know nothing I write or say can change that. Just as the archbishop could not make Roger Casement repent of Ireland’s cause. You insist that before the Tiger, Ireland was a dark place. Who, looking at it honestly, can fail to see its faults? Some of its peculiar defects did leave a residue here in America. It could be coldly intellectual. It could become the vindictive enforcer of a Victorian morality that made no sense in Ireland. Even now I find the speed at which Irish rosary sodalities move through their prayers totally alien and alienating. Worst of all, the Church in Ireland abetted child abuse and hid this crime through moral cronyism, elaborately disguised as a fear of scandal.
But the idea that there is nothing for Ireland to do with 15 centuries of Christianity but celebrate its destruction seems uncreative somehow. If a man like Casement could see something in it, surely there is something you might. The idea that there is nothing “useful” in the Rising for modern Ireland also seems like blindness. There is a Patrick Kavanagh poem about Irish religion that haunts me. Often titled “Pilgrims,” it found no publisher in his life. It recounts the way Irish people went to a holy well, seeking life, knowledge, and vision, but all related to the immediate necessities of life. “Life that for a farmer is land enough to keep two horses,” or “knowledge that is in knowing what fair to sell the cattle in.” But these very practical petitions are answered with something greater.
I saw them kneeling, climbing and prostrate —
It was love, love, love they found:
Love that is Christ green walking from the summer headlands
To His scarecrow cross in the turnip-ground.
When I was a young man, I was not pushed anywhere near the edge. Unlike Casement I had nothing like the pride and boast of Empire to confront in life. I had no needs so earthy as those in Kavanagh’s poem. But I did choose to confront you. I needed to send you my petitions. Advertisement
On a Saturday afternoon, I went to the library of my college and ended a decade of silent treatment, of having ignored your letters. I wrote you a long one, trying to condense my teenage years into a dozen or so pages. I was proud to give my report: I was at a good school. I had learned to fend for myself as my grandmother aged. I could cook. I still watched after my mother. I had had one serious girlfriend when I was in high school, and I had another serious girlfriend now that I was in college. After some journeying, I had come back to Catholicism. At the same time, I tried to demonstrate to you that I was arch, witty, and smart. I was no sucker or raving lunatic. I wasn’t sentimental or self-deluded. All in all, I was a young man to be reckoned with.
I would cringe to reread it now. All the above amounted to a series of not-so-subtle digs about how different I was from you. This is who I am , I seemed to say — and the heavy implication was that you had nothing to do with it. And you ought to get to know me; maybe I’m worth knowing.
But was I worth knowing? I doubt it. Not only was I painfully insecure, I was shallow. Someone who approaches life like a curator will exchange his faith for merely believing in belief. He’ll substitute taste where conviction belongs. I was merely gliding on the surface of life.
Still, you treated this little gesture as if it could be the basis for going forward. It wasn’t long afterward that you and I arranged to meet up in New York. You would bring your wife and your other children, my half siblings whom I’d met only in pictures you sent me. I’d bring that girlfriend, the woman who is now my very pregnant wife. And soon enough I would find out just how deluded and full of myself I really was.

Socialism's Rise & Fall: 'Heaven on Earth' Book Review | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Paul Hollander,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/socialisms-rise-and-fall-heaven-on-earth-book-review/,"About Paul Hollander April 18, 2019 11:10 AM Britain’s Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn delivers his keynote speech at the Labour Party Conference in Liverpool, Britain, September 26, 2018. (Phil Noble/Reuters) Heaven on Earth: The Rise, Fall, and Afterlife of Socialism , by Joshua Muravchik (Encounter Books 424 pp., $18.99)
T he volume here reviewed is the second edition of a book first published in 2002. I reviewed it favorably (with some reservations) in 2003. A good case can be made for the new edition, given the survival of socialist ideals and the persisting disagreements about their nature and realizability. It remains of interest why people in different parts of the world are still attracted to these ideals and why the same ideals have been so difficult to implement. Of special interest is what Joshua Muravchik calls the “afterlife” of socialism — what happened to these ideals and political aspirations after the political systems supposedly dedicated to their realization, such as the Soviet Union, ceased to exist. Advertisement Advertisement
As the reader is informed in the preface, the new edition is largely unchanged, except for the addition of an epilogue, some updating of the chapter on the kibbutzim (collective farms of modern Israel), and the correction of small errors.
The difficulty of coming to grips with the subject — that is, the proper understanding of the nature of socialist ideals and their realizability — has not diminished since the book was first published. The problem begins with the widely held, undifferentiated views of socialism shared by most Americans. They are unaware of the fundamental differences between authoritarian (or totalitarian) state socialism embedded in one-party systems, such as the former Soviet one or the Chinese one under Mao, and social-democratic societies, such as those in Scandinavia. The latter are politically liberal and pluralistic and seek to reduce economic inequalities through high taxes and a range of social services. It is this ignorance of the deep moral and institutional gulf between these two very different political systems that allowed President Trump to hold forth about the horrors of socialism without specifying whether he had in mind the Soviet Gulag or child care in Sweden. By the same token, it is also incumbent on the new, young Democratic representatives in Congress who sing the praises of socialism to make clear that they are aware of the morally decisive differences between democratic socialism and the repressive one-party states calling themselves “socialist.” Advertisement
Since one-party-state socialist systems largely succeeded in usurping the “socialist” designation, it might have been wiser in this new edition to either completely eliminate or greatly reduce the discussion of British social democracy (i.e., the chapters on Atlee and Blair). On the other hand, if it was the author’s intention to present different approaches toward the realization of socialist ideals, the durable democratic socialism of the Scandinavian countries should have been included. Advertisement
Important conceptual distinctions are further obscured when under the same heading (“Triumphs”) we find chapters on Lenin’s seizure of power, Mussolini’s “socialism,” British social democracy under Atlee, and Nyerere’s African socialism. It is also unclear why a chapter on conflicts within the American trade-union movement was put in the part entitled “Collapse,” along with chapters on Deng and Gorbachev, Tony Blair, and the kibbutz. Advertisement
The volume might have been made more coherent by clearly separating the discussion of socialist ideals from the historical attempts to realize them, whether in small utopian communities, social-democratic countries, or authoritarian one-party states.
Apart from these structural-organizational problems, the book remains an informative introduction to the attempts to create socialist systems or communities variously conceived. Especially interesting is the chapter on the kibbutz, a unique experiment in creating, without coercion, utopian communities that had an authentic socialist — that is to say, egalitarian — inspiration. Advertisement
It is the attempted updating by means of the epilogue that is the least satisfactory. The “afterlife” of socialism, its continued appeal and divergent interpretations, and the unforeseen consequences of its attempted realization, cannot be adequately dealt with in a brief epilogue. There have been developments in this century that deserve attention and that this epilogue did not, and could not, address. They include the political disposition and influence of some prominent Western intellectuals — Alain Badiou, Noam Chomsky, Stephen F. Cohen, Angela Davis, José Saramago, and Slavoj Zizek, among others — who still cling to certain socialist ideals or seek to revive them. The afterlife of socialism cannot be reduced to the toxic disposition of Jeremy Corbyn of Britain or the more benign concerns and misconceptions of our Bernie Sanders — two figures (and their supporters) who dominate the epilogue. A particularly important phenomenon overlooked is the alienation of left-leaning young people in affluent, pluralistic Western societies and similar sentiments among the new right-wing populists. The former know little about the repression, regimentation, and scarcities that prevailed in the state-socialist systems. This ignorance makes it easier to harbor illusions about the sense of community attributed even to the remaining authoritarian socialist societies. Many of these young people are anti-capitalist because they associate capitalism with selfishness, impersonality, and lack of community more than with social injustices. Advertisement
Arguably, it is the “afterlife” that brought us right-wing populism, especially among the white working classes and older people similarly concerned with loss of community, weak social bonds, and meaninglessness. It seems to me that the central, shared grievance of the “new New leftists” and the right-wing populists can be traced to modernity (in its familiar capitalist incarnation): that is, to social isolation, secularization, and the loss of meaning. The populist nationalism and glorification of the past are pathways to a hoped-for restoration of community and stable moral values that modernity has undermined. "
"Game of Thrones, Season 8, Episode 1: Recap | National Review",www.nationalreview.com,Rob Long,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/magazine/2019/05/06/game-of-thrones-season-8-episode-1-recap/,"April 18, 2019 11:40 AM Jon Snow (Kit Harington) in Game of Thrones (Helen Sloan/HBO)
This episode opened with echoes of the first episode of the first season — a small child running through the village as a royal procession makes its way to the castle in the North, in preparation for the final battle to come. It’s a satisfying and tension-filled parade, with (almost) all of the characters we’ve loved and hated over the past few years finally gathering together, in a kind of uneasy unity.
But for all of the pageantry and protestations of peace and common cause, it’s impossible to watch the episode without remembering that most of these characters will not make it to the series finale. Even those who manage to navigate the treacherous and deadly politics of the final six episodes will end up facing almost-certain death in the grand battle against the undead king.
It’s clear, for instance, in the first moments of this episode that the power and momentum is entirely with Bernie Sanders. He arrives in Winterfell a wiser and more battle-tested warrior and the obvious front-runner.
But is he too battle-worn? Given to outbursts and paranoia, he seems like a figure from yesterday. For instance, he has essentially zero dragons, while his chief rival, Kamala Harris, has two of them. One of Harris’s dragons is her law-and-order credentials, the result of her earlier career as a public prosecutor. The other dragon is her quirky and intriguing ethnicity — not exactly Westeros, not exactly Dothraki — that contrasts well with the tired and sagging Bernie Sanders. She seems sleek and poised, he seems like a guy who can’t eat a sandwich without inadvertently spitting most of it on his lunch partner’s shirt.
Now that the High Sparrow is dead and the period of fundamentalist religious revival is gone, audiences are more willing to see Mayor Pete, the Unpronounceable, as a potential winner of the Game. He has some terrific moments in the first episode, though longtime Game of Thrones watchers know that this is often a setup — the producers like to take an early audience favorite and kill him or her off in spectacular fashion. Be forewarned: Don’t fall in love with this guy.
Cory Booker, who fell on his head in childhood, sits quietly for most of the episode, staring out into the middle distance, seeing the future but unable to clarify in any useful way what, exactly, he’s talking about. Booker is a long shot to win the Game of Thrones — mostly because of his head injury — and it’s clear that the people of Winterfell have a hard time taking him seriously.
Unlike Maester Elizabeth Warren, whom they take too seriously. In this early episode, at least, she’s left in the library, writing tracts and treatises that no one will read. In one pivotal and revealing scene, she looks up from her writing to discover that she’s not alone. Next to her are Eric Swalwell and Tim Ryan. “Aren’t you guys supposed to be with the third-tier candidates?” She asks. “We are,” they say. It’s a powerful moment when Maester Warren realizes that she’s a third-tier candidate. The camera lingers on her, and we see her spirit and enthusiasm slowly drain from her face.
Spoiler alert! The camera pans over two lifeless bodies as two other unidentified characters dig their graves. If you pause the image, it looks a lot like John Hickenlooper and Kirsten Gillibrand are the bodies and Tulsi Gabbard and Jay Inslee are the gravediggers, though on subsequent viewings it seems possibly the other way around. And that’s what’s so great about Game of Thrones — so many layers of meaning!
Joe Biden, First of His Name to Go to College (Unconfirmed), wanders aimlessly through this episode, mumbling apologies and offering back rubs. He has aged a great deal since Season 7, but in a few quick moments we see a glint of the familiar Joe — and it’s clear that the producers (and maybe Joe himself) are encouraging us to underestimate him, perhaps preparing us for his eventual victory."

• Bernie, soak thyself.
• Representative Ilhan Omar’s latest turn on the national stage came in a March speech to a meeting of CAIR, in which she referred to 9/11 as “some people did something” and said Muslims in America were subjected to bigotry as a result. Omar was minimizing one of the greatest attacks on American soil. She provoked outrage, most heatedly in New York, where the New York Post ran a cover juxtaposing her words with an image of the burning Twin Towers. Harsh, but fair. Then President Trump piled on, with a video tweet making the same point. Omar’s allies meanwhile branded criticism of her as incitement, since she has been getting death threats. Death threats should be prosecuted zealously, but criticisms are not death threats; the madly wicked are responsible for their own violence. Pols across the board could speak more carefully, and it can start with the member from Minnesota.
• Bernie Sanders reintroduced his Medicare for All bill, which keeps getting more expensive: Now it’s going to cover long-term care, too. As always, the pitch for socialized medicine is that in other countries it delivers better health outcomes at lower costs. It is a misleading comparison, since, among other things, it glosses over differences in lifestyle among countries. Besides, what Sanders is proposing is unprecedented: throwing scores of millions of people off private plans they mostly like (and another 20 million off Medicare Advantage) while slashing payment rates to medical providers. Americans should avoid this dangerous experiment for the sake of their health as well as their finances.
• The revelation that Sanders made millions from his post-2016 book Our Revolution brought a spirited defense from the candidate himself. “I wrote a best-selling book,” Sanders said proudly. “If you write a best-selling book, you can be a millionaire, too.” Well, if Marx had put it that way . . .
• Sarah Sanders declared that members of Congress may not be “smart enough” to examine President Trump’s tax returns. This is a silly defense of the president’s unreasonable refusal to release his tax returns for public examination. But there is a much better public defense: The law congressional Democrats are invoking is overbroad and dangerous. It essentially exempts the chairmen of key congressional committees from tax-privacy laws. It allows them to examine any taxpayer’s records merely on request. And while the law has rarely been used since its passage in 1924, its very public use against Trump sets a dangerous new precedent. Trump should release his taxes voluntarily. But he should challenge Congress’s power to demand his records at will — the better to protect all citizens from curious, snooping government eyes.
• The first major poll in Maine since the 2018 midterms has good news for Republican senator Susan Collins, who leads her potential Democratic challenger by more than 20 percentage points. The Pan Atlantic Research of Portland poll found that the current senator received 51 percent support compared with 29 percent for Sara Gideon, who is currently the speaker of the Maine House of Representatives. You’ll recall that Collins was briefly a top target of Democrats after she gave Brett Kavanaugh the decisive vote to join the Supreme Court. At that time, the Kavanaugh controversy was supposed to cost Republicans nationally. It ended up helping red-state Senate candidates. It doesn’t seem to be hurting them in at least one blue state either.
• Pete Buttigieg, the Democratic mayor of South Bend, Ind., is rising in the polls in the presidential race. Much of his appeal is based on his combining qualities that are often opposed in our politics. He is a standard-issue liberal, but religious; gay, but from (a reliably Democratic city in) the heartland; a young veteran. It helps that he is well spoken and moderate in demeanor; it does not seem to hurt that South Bend is not noticeably better for his tenure. It looks like we are all going to have to learn to spell and say his name.
• Every major analysis of the tax law that Republicans enacted in late 2017 has found that it cuts tax bills for most Americans. Polls have just as consistently found that most Americans don’t think they’re getting a tax cut — and that many more of them think they got a tax increase than actually did. (Fewer than 10 percent saw a tax increase.) Blame liberal spin, aided by the media; but also blame the public’s skepticism about government. Conservative sentiments don’t always aid conservative politicians.
• After medical professionals warned that pain patients are having increasing difficulty getting effective treatment, the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control both issued statements clarifying that they do not endorse “mandated or abrupt” reductions in opioid prescriptions for such patients. It’s an overdue move. Excess opioid prescriptions undoubtedly played a role in unleashing a social plague. But they are playing less and less of one — heroin and fentanyl account for a high and rising proportion of all overdoses — and policymakers have been slow to adjust. Senators Cory Gardner (R., Colo.) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D., N.Y.) want to legislate new limits on prescriptions for acute pain. The adage about generals’ fighting the last war applies, it turns out, to the war on drugs.
• The fallout from the Supreme Court’s Janus decision guaranteeing public-union employees their First Amendment rights — eradicating compelled speech, which in turn eradicated compelled “agency fees” — is hurting the bottom line of Big Labor. The NEA, AFSCME, and SEIU all report a decline in fees as nonmembers have embraced their opt-out right. This reporting doesn’t include figures from the late-June decision, but the NEA’s latest annual report, which includes only two post- Janus months, shows a decline of 75,000 dues payers. Bloomberg reports that the rolls of SEIU and AFSCME declined by a combined 210,000. In areas where pro-liberty groups — such as the Freedom Foundation, which operates on the West Coast — are aggressively informing workers of their Janus rights, the declines have been sharp: The Oakland-based AFSCME Council 57 has lost over 12 percent from its rolls. The bosses, disregarding the Laffer Curve, have reacted by raising dues. All the more reason to opt out.
• Conservatives scored a big win in a little-watched Wisconsin supreme-court election the first week of April. The state’s justices are elected to ten-year terms, and in last year’s spring election the conservative lost by twelve percentage points to the liberal one. This year, conservatives again appeared doomed when business groups abandoned their candidate Brian Hagedorn, former governor Scott Walker’s counsel, after the local press and the Left labeled him an anti-gay bigot. The smear was based in part on Hagedorn’s role in founding a private Christian school that upholds the traditional Christian teachings that marriage is a union between one man and one woman and sex outside of marriage is wrong. But the attack backfired, and conservative activists propelled Hagedorn to a 50.25–to–49.75 percent upset victory. The win likely protects conservative gains made under Scott Walker’s tenure from liberal judicial activists for at least several more years and serves as a warning nationwide about the perils of smearing a candidate as a bigot for believing his faith’s two-millennia-old teaching about marriage.
• Two different airports have blocked Chick-fil-A from the premises. First, the city council of San Antonio banned the chain because, in the words of councilman Roberto Treviño, “everyone should feel welcome when they walk through our airport.” Then, two weeks later, a New York Democratic assemblyman, Sean Ryan, announced that the Buffalo airport food vendor was prohibiting Chick-fil-A from operating in its food court. Ryan was explicit about the reason, declaring in a statement that “the views of Chick-fil-A do not represent our state or the Western New York community.” This is a dramatic action — one that is both plainly unconstitutional (the government may not bar access to benefits based on the private religious or political views of the owner) and extremist. Chick-fil-A is being punished for its foundation’s donations to the Salvation Army and the Fellowship of Christian Athletes, two Christian organizations that do great good for America’s youth and for the poor. The signal has been sent: Not even mainstream Christian organizations are safe from the far Left’s wrath.
• A measles outbreak among ultra-Orthodox Jews in Brooklyn caused Mayor Bill de Blasio to declare a public-health emergency. When new cases appear, public-health officials will check the vaccination records of those who could be infected and levy fines where appropriate. Nothing in ultra-Orthodoxy forbids vaccination; an editorial in a Hasidic newspaper branded resistance to it “Senseless! Heartless! Torah-less and Reckless.” But a minority in that community, as among New Age types in the Pacific Northwest, has fallen prey to a superstitious dread of the procedure. Airhead celebrities, including former centerfold Jenny McCarthy, have helped spread the nonsense in the broader culture. In 1806, Thomas Jefferson sent Edward Jenner, discoverer of the smallpox vaccine, a heartfelt tribute: “Mankind can never forget that you have lived.” Jefferson was too sanguine.
• “Water and fire shall rot / The marred foundations we forgot, / Of sanctuary and choir. / This is the death of water and fire.” So T. S. Eliot wrote during the Blitz. The fire that consumed the roof and spire of Notre Dame cathedral in Paris was, it appears, the work of accident, not of the Luftwaffe, but the destruction was vast. Stones and timbers that witnessed reformation, revolution, occupation, every species of horror, heroism, and everyday life, fell in four hours. In the wake of this incineration, every man is a Parisian, and a Frenchman. But buildings can be rebuilt, treasures lost can be reimagined, if the spirit is willing. “The end of all our exploring / Will be to arrive where we started / And know the place for the first time.”
• Last year Sir Roger Scruton, Britain’s most eminent public intellectual, who risked his life protecting academic freedom behind the Iron Curtain, was nearly sacked as an unpaid government adviser on architecture after left-wing journalists (the usual offense-archeologists) fueled a social-media frenzy against him. In April, the show trial was revived and Scruton was sacked. His supposedly bigoted comments, deemed “unacceptable” by the Tory party, were made during an interview with the deputy editor of the New Statesman, George Eaton. Eaton quoted Scruton selectively, isolating phrases such as “Soros empire,” “tribes of Muslims,” and “robots” (in reference to the Chinese; though, in fact, Scruton was referring to the authoritarianism of the Chinese Communist Party). Gratified, Eaton then posted a picture of himself on Instagram, swigging champagne, and added the smug caption, “The feeling you get when you get right-wing racist and homophobe Roger Scruton sacked as a government adviser.” After much criticism, Eaton apologized for his social-media conduct and removed the picture. He has not yet released the full transcript of the interview. As Niall Ferguson wrote in the Times of London, “the reputation destroyed last week was not Sir Roger Scruton’s but the New Statesman ’s.”
• The Times of London reports that five clinicians have resigned from the British National Health Service’s only gender clinic for children, citing unethical treatment. Over the past three years, at least 18 staff have reportedly quit the clinic for reasons of conscientious objection. The five former staff at the Gender Identity Development Service clinic had been responsible for determining which children were transgender and which should be prescribed hormone therapy. Clinicians complained that lobbyists — such as the transgender-child charity Mermaids UK — had been putting pressure on doctors to provide drugs and surgeries. The director of the Centre of Evidence-Based Medicine at the University of Oxford called the treatment “an unregulated live experiment on children.” Such practices are not, alas, unknown in the U.S. National Review has reported that the Office for Human Research Protections is starting a review of a five-year study on transgender children’s being given hormones and puberty blockers. A FOIA request has revealed that the age minimum of participants for cross-sex hormones was lowered from 13 to eight. Across the developed world, the transgender revolution is putting pressure on medical ethics.
• Julian Assange took a seven-year vacation in the Airbnb of Ecuador’s London embassy. A new government in Quito, tired of his presence, lifted his immunity, whereupon the Brits arrested him. The United States will now demand extradition. Assange and WikiLeaks have been bad actors from Day One — and specifically, when they were broadcasting life-imperiling military information during the Afghan War, and when they were feeding DNC documents to the media in 2016. In both instances they acted at the behest of their frequent bankroller, the Kremlin, which sought to hobble presumed future president Hillary Clinton or to sow division generally. The Justice Department has indicted Assange for computer fraud, wisely sidestepping his status as a “journalist” but inviting a fight over the statute of limitations. Shame on him, and on those many Republicans, from Trump on down, who applauded him when he seemed to be doing their work.
• When Benjamin Netanyahu called for a general election months ahead of its due date, many observers were sure that “Bibi” had taken a risk too far and would cease to be prime minister. Under Benny Gantz, a former chief of staff, the Left had reinvented itself as the Blue and White party, reassuringly centrist and from time to time ahead in the polls. It played into their hands when Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit let it be known that Netanyahu was likely to be indicted on three charges of doing illegal, or at least unethical, favors for friends. For his part, Netanyahu campaigned on a promise to incorporate into Israel the controversial Jewish settlements on the West Bank. His general policy on terrorists, Iranians, and the hostile Western media is to give as good as he gets, and then just a little more. Hence voters were happy to give him an unprecedented fifth term in office.
• At long last, the United States designated the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a foreign terrorist organization. It has been a terrorist organization since its founding, and it has been active in Iraq. Iran is responsible for the deaths of hundreds of American soldiers since the start of the War on Terror, and the IRGC has often been at the tip of Iran’s spear. As a practical matter, the designation makes it easier to prosecute individuals or corporations who do business with Iran. As a symbolic matter, it declares U.S. resolve to deal with the Iranian threat. Combined with the Trump administration’s decision to withdraw from the Iran deal, the terrorist designation of the IRGC sends a clear and necessary message to Tehran.
• Since 2002, Recep Tayyip Erdogan has risen from being the mayor of Istanbul to being prime minister of Turkey and then its president, all the while a reconstituted Ottoman sultan in his own imagination. His Justice and Development party, the AKP in its Turkish acronym, wins elections by hook and especially by crook, so it was all the more mind-blowing that in recent local elections it lost Istanbul to the opposition. The winning Republican People’s party has so slim a majority that the AKP took the chance to demand recounts in selective districts, first of invalid ballots and then of the entire vote of the 14 or so million Istanbulis. Should they get their way, have the election canceled, and hold another that puts them in power, a Republican spokesman says that even crows will laugh.
• The Saudi government is doing what it does: arresting dissidents and torturing them. Lately, the government has concentrated on women: women who have been asking for simple rights, such as the right to move about on their own, without the permission or company of a male relative. Most recently, the government has rounded up at least ten people, two of whom are Saudi-U.S. dual nationals. The new prisoners are not “front-line activists,” as one report put it. Instead, they are merely known to support women’s rights, or to have ties to those already imprisoned. One of the new prisoners is pregnant: Khadijah al-Harbi, a writer. Women have been held in solitary confinement, and some have reported being electrocuted, caned, sexually assaulted — the usual. The Saudi government may be a necessary ally of the United States, but we should be clear that our ally is a nasty piece of work.
• Omar al-Bashir, the president of Sudan since 1989, was deposed and detained in a military coup in April, after months of protests in the capital, Khartoum. Beginning in 2003, Bashir directed mass assaults on civilians in the Darfur region, the International Criminal Court alleged. Issued in 2009, the ICC’s warrant for his arrest on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity has yet to be honored. Spokesmen for the Sudanese army say that they won’t let Bashir be extradited to stand trial at The Hague, or anywhere, and that he’ll be tried in Sudan instead. To that end, the U.S. State Department should provide encouragement and expert legal counsel to Khartoum, with the specific aim of identifying witnesses and Sudanese jurists, many of whom are now in exile. It’s the best chance the world stands of bringing to justice the alleged war criminal on a massive scale.
• In 1997, the United Kingdom handed over Hong Kong to the Chinese Communist Party, which rules China. The CCP promised “one country, two systems.” In short, Hong Kong could remain free, while the rest of the country was Communist. That was always an unfunny joke. In 2014, democratic protests broke out, known as the Umbrella Movement. (Protesters used their umbrellas to shield themselves from pepper spray.) Participants have been tried and locked up. Most recently, nine leaders of the movement were convicted, and they now face seven years in prison. One of them, Professor Benny Tai, said, “This is a case about some Hong Kong people who love Hong Kong very much.” The CCP may love its power still more.
• “Why did pedophilia reach such proportions?” the former Pope Benedict XVI asked in a stunning intervention into the Catholic Church’s self-examination, published at the beginning of April. He answers his own question: “Ultimately, the reason is the absence of God.” The pope emeritus had promised to live a life of silent prayer. But the publication of his recent letter, one written to help the cardinals and bishops who gathered to discuss the abuse of minors in the Church, is the most clear and expressive message to date. He writes as a witness to the events in question. He traces the abuse crisis to a theological breakdown in the 1960s, in which the Church tried to revise its understanding of moral theology. Some theologians were so bold as to say that no action could be described as intrinsically evil. “What must be done?” the former pontiff asks, before mocking the pretensions of his opponents. “Perhaps we should create another Church for things to work out? Well, that experiment has already been undertaken and has already failed.” In some ways the question can be turned back on Benedict, who has created something new in the Church, an office for retired popes. His intervention is a reminder that Benedict has put the Church in an ironical and sad position: The ecclesiastical figure who exercises no authority in the governance of the Church still possesses the lion’s share of intellectual and moral authority among the hierarchs.
• For years, Cuban players joined Major League Baseball the hard way: by undertaking escapes, often dangerous, and putting themselves in the hands of smugglers (human traffickers). Wishing to prevent this, MLB struck a deal with the Cuban Baseball Federation. Under the terms of the deal, the federation would allow players to join MLB teams. A player would keep 100 percent of his signing bonus — but the team would have to pay the federation 25 percent of the bonus, on top of that. Also, the player would have to send back 4 percent of his earnings to Cuba, as income tax. MLB has similar arrangements with Japan, South Korea, and China. The Trump administration, however, has nixed the deal, saying that the Cuban Baseball Federation is an arm of the Cuban government — which it certainly is — and that the deal treated Cuban players like property of the Cuban state. (Needless to say, there are no independent entities in China, either.) We regard this as a close call, with the wishes of the players themselves probably getting low priority. The ultimate solution, of course, is the liberalization of Cuba, which our government should hasten in all ways possible and prudent.
• Last September, Tiger Woods won the Tour Championship, his first victory in five years. It was his 80th win, putting him two behind Sam Snead, the all-time leader in this category. Of Woods’s victory in the Tour Championship, we said, “Some experts are calling this the greatest comeback in the history of sports.” We continued, “Woods is now 42, and is unlikely to stop winning.” Woods has now won the first major since the Tour Championship: the Masters. It is his 15th victory in a major. (Jack Nicklaus is the leader in this category, with 18.) Woods had not won a major since the U.S. Open in 2008. The eleven years between ’08 and ’19 were a strange trip for him, involving moral, mental, and physical collapse. The comeback of Tiger Woods has thrilled people all over the world, and many of them have no interest in golf. They just know an inspiring story when they see one.
• James Lane Buckley, brother of our founder and onetime director of this entity, has served the nation as have few others — in all three branches of government. A former United States senator from New York, judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, and undersecretary of state for President Reagan, he somehow also managed to be president of Radio Free Europe. And Lieutenant Buckley, U.S. Navy, was in the thick of combat at Leyte, Okinawa, and other major Pacific battles. Several weeks back, seeming decades younger than his 96 years, this gentlest and happiest of warriors capped the National Review Institute Ideas Summit by addressing the assembled on his favorite theme, our country’s need for federalism. (An excerpt from his speech is below.) His remarks were smart, powerful marching orders deserving of heed. Before he gave them, Jim Buckley let it slip that the speech would be his final public appearance. It was fitting punctuation on the career of a great American, and it has been a singular honor for National Review to be alongside him for much of this journey. The Case for Federalism
Editor’s Note: The following is adapted from James L. Buckley’s speech at the National Review Institute Ideas Summit, March 29, 2019.
The Tenth Amendment of the Bill of Rights provides that “the powers not delegated to the United States by this Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.” This allocation of powers mirrors those of the venerable Rule of Subsidiarity, which assigns responsibilities to the lowest levels capable of handling them. Its effect is to decentralize political power and ensure, wherever feasible, that the decisions that most directly affect people will be made by those who are the closest to them and most familiar with both their priorities and the relevant facts.
But with the advent of Lyndon Johnson’s Great Society, Congress began a wholesale assumption of the states’ responsibilities. This was done through a proliferation of programs that offer states and their subdivisions regulation-ridden grants of money for purposes that are acknowledged to be the sole responsibility of the states. The Supreme Court has ruled that the states may not be coerced into accepting the grants and their attendant regulations. Experience, however, has demonstrated that the states find it enormously difficult to decline them, whatever their conditions. Thus the practical effect of the Court’s decision has been to empower Congress to, yes, coerce the states into adopting Washington’s approach to matters that remain the states’ exclusive responsibility.
Federal grant programs have effectively nullified the Tenth Amendment, and, in the process, helped undermine Congress’s ability to function effectively. But what can be done about it? Four years ago, I had the temerity to write a book with the title “Saving Congress from Itself,” in which I detailed the extraordinary systemic and financial costs of those programs on both state and federal levels and proposed a simple reform that would restore federalism; namely, their conversion into block grants free of federal directives telling the states how the money was to be spent. It is a reform that, at one stroke, would reduce federal spending by major amounts in administrative costs alone, rid Congress of a significant distraction from its essential national responsibilities, and restore the people’s ability to control their own state and local affairs. Needless to say, Congress has yet to act on my advice.
I recognize, however, that we now live in novel times. The power to move political mountains is passing from printed books to the social media, or so I’m told. So there may be another way to force congressional attention. What I dream of is a tweet in which the president advises Congress that he will veto any bill that tells the states how to run their own affairs. Such a tweet would stir up a vigorous debate of the merits of my proposal and encourage its adoption. It might even remind our countrymen that our Constitution indeed places limits on what the federal government may engage in and that the enforcement of those limits might well be in their interest.
• “One of the best things about writing is that it’s private,” Charles Van Doren noted in The New Yorker in 2008. For 15 minutes in the late 1950s he’d been famous, as a telegenic, well-spoken young champion of the TV quiz-show circuit. The shows were rigged, though, and he lied at first when law enforcement and the media got wise to the game. Then he confessed and lost his teaching job at Columbia (where his father, Mark, was already a pillar of the English department), and NBC fired him from his lucrative gig. He never quite shook off the infamy. He went to work in publishing and wrote and edited for many years with some distinction, primarily for Encyclopaedia Britannica, Inc. Having made himself a high-profile villain in an age of relative innocence, when dissimulation in pursuit of ratings was considered not just tawdry but a shocking ethical scandal of national importance, he paid the price. The Greatest Generation held one another to some pretty high standards of honor and integrity. Dead at 93. R.I.P.
• Paul Hollander was born in Hungary in 1932. In 1944, his family (Jewish) went into hiding. Twelve-year-old Paul, anticipating his death, wondered what it was like to be shot. He discussed it with his father, who had been wounded in World War I. When the Soviets came in, Paul welcomed them as liberators and allied himself with Communism. As was true for many, that did not last long. He escaped to America, where he earned a Ph.D. in sociology at Princeton. He spent most of his career at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. He also spent a good deal of time explaining Communism to sleepy people in free countries. He wrote many books, among them Political Pilgrims (1981), about the travels of Western intellectuals to the Soviet Union, China, and Cuba. He wrote for NR over the years, including a review for this issue. He was authoritative on anti-Americanism, political correctness, identity politics, etc. He had a clear, unflinching eye, and he taught a lot of us, mainly outside the classroom, through his writings. Paul Hollander has died at 86, having given of his rich experience — asked for or not — and exceptional intellect. R.I.P.
• After recovering from the shock of Pearl Harbor, most Americans never doubted that their country would defeat the Axis in World War II. Still, there were times in 1942, amid ship sinkings, the relentless Japanese advance in the Pacific, and American defeat in the Philippines, when that faith was hard to sustain. Those dark early days were brightened considerably when a group of 16 fearless Army Air Forces crews led by Colonel James Doolittle struck a blow at the very heart of the Japanese empire by taking off from the deck of the USS Hornet and flying 600 miles to bomb Tokyo. After the bombing, the pilots had to crash-land their planes in China and do their best to find a way to safety. Strategically, the raid had little significance, but for boosting morale, in the armed forces and among civilians, it was monumental. From the late 1940s to 2013, the brave men who had volunteered for this mission met every year in reunion, and now the last of them, Lieutenant Colonel Richard E. Cole (Doolittle’s co-pilot), has died at age 103. R.I.P.
IMMIGRATION Irresponsibility at the Border
T he border crisis rumbles on. There were more than 100,000 apprehensions in March, higher than the 76,000 in February, which had been the highest monthly figure in more ten years. By some estimates, we could receive more than a million migrants in a year, and nearly 1 percent of the population of Guatemala and Honduras could come here.
It is true that apprehensions were higher in the 2000s, but the population was different then. It was overwhelmingly single men from Mexico who, if caught at the border, were simply returned home (perhaps to try to cross again). Now, the majority of migrants are minors or family units from Central America who under our perverse immigration rules can’t be easily sent back.
President Trump is understandably enraged by the situation, but is lashing out in foolish ways. He cashiered Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen. The White House believes she wasn’t pushing the bureaucracy hard enough for regulatory changes, and there may be truth to this, but the biggest problem was that, through no fault of her own, Nielsen was presiding over this crisis.
He has threatened to close the border to force more cooperation from Mexico, but a border closure would cause considerable economic pain on our side of the border, too, and Mexico will never be as invested in stopping migrants coming to the U.S. as we want them to be. It’s not their problem.
Finally, he has talked of sending migrants to sanctuary cities. But ICE is underfunded and overwhelmed and doesn’t have the wherewithal to carry out a major logistical operation on top of its current responsibilities. Regardless, migrants shouldn’t be shipped around the country as political pawns."
Ben Shapiro's 'The Right Side of History' Book Review | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Tracy Lee Simmons,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/ben-shapiros-right-side-of-history-a-call-to-reclaim-the-wests-birthright/,"April 18, 2019 10:44 AM The Statue of Liberty in New York Harbor (Brendan McDermid/Reuters) The Right Side of History: How Reason and Moral Purpose Made the West Great , by Ben Shapiro (Broadside Books, 288 pp., $27.99)
T he trashing of Western civilization in the academy has been moving apace for decades. It’s an easy target for the chronically disaffected. Back in the 1980s, in a gust of consciousness-raising, Jesse Jackson flew out to Stanford to help student marchers shoulder the heavy lifting of chanting “Hey hey, ho ho, Western Civ has got to go” while paying little heed to what might replace the civilization that made their protest possible. Advertisement
The contemporary descendants of those protesters likely won’t queue up for Professor Ben Shapiro’s course in Western Civ 101, the lecture notes for which are available in Shapiro’s The Right Side of History , a book delineating a view of the past that few educated people would have disputed in its essence 75 years ago but that is now so heterodox as to deserve the moniker of “trendy.” Western civilization, which has provided such a munificent spiritual and material bounty for millennia, owes its very existence to a sturdy though delicately landscaped grounding in tenacious moral purpose matched with a relentless hunger for rational understanding that drove our ancestors to make the universe explicable in the face of its manifold mysteries. This is cutting-edge musing in a.d. 2019 (or c.e., if they insist), which might say more about us than it does about the grand old view itself.
In other words, those enriching traits of our civilization so disparaged and deconstructed by postmodernists with such dismissive facility are the very graces — from Aristotle to aeronautics, from Dante to dentistry — that have made us thrive and have ennobled all those men and women down the ages who have endeavored, often through colossal hardships, to build a humane world and to pass on its accumulated wisdom and knowledge from one generation to the next. Shapiro’s case is, among other things, an exercise in how not to take gifts for granted. Advertisement
Those twin peaks of morality and rationality Shapiro sums up, predictably enough, as Jerusalem and Athens, taking his cue from Tertullian, a crotchety third-century Church father, who asked, somewhat puritanically, “What does Athens have to do with Jerusalem?” For those who wish to live intelligently with moral rectitude, quite a bit. Without reason, imparted by “Athens,” we cannot make heads or tails of the world we’re living in; we have no map. Without revelation, though, imparted by “Jerusalem,” we have no rules that can guide us with that map toward a better, more fruitful life — to a life lived, that is, in consonance with God. Both are required, along with their auxiliaries: the discipline needed to learn from reason and the humility needed to learn from revelation. Reason, Shapiro argues, can teach us how not to be bad, but only revelation can teach us truly how to be good according to transcendent norms. We’re free to disagree with all this, but the notion has had, to say the least, a fairly long run with people of former times who might best us in the greatness sweepstakes, which is more than a faint subtheme to this book. Better people have preceded us, and we ignore them at our peril.
Ignore them we have but, as Shapiro also explains, the neglect has been going on for some time. This book provides an excursion into the intellectual history of the West, from Mt. Sinai to the latest barbarity in Slate , usefully retold for those who know the story and accessibly digested for those who don’t. Nothing frightfully original comes out of these pages — and that’s one of the book’s virtues. Despite Shapiro’s jubilant reputation among young fans for controversy, he writes here more as an ardent student of history and a defender of the old wisdom than as a debater blithely chalking up points. His point of view shines out of every sentence, but it’s a methodical, not a grenade-throwing, one; those who come here to see idiocy “destroyed” — in agitated YouTube-descriptor fashion — may be disappointed, though they’ll be rewarded if they keep reading (and one may say that to expose most idiocies is also to destroy them). Advertisement Advertisement
Shapiro does a masterly job outlining the last 3,000 years of the intellectual struggles our betters endured to figure out our place in the cosmos, a feat harder to pull off than it looks, and he shows how our progenitors have progressed as well as regressed from time to time. He begins with the story of the ancient Hebrews and their wrestle to understand God and His not always comprehensible ways and then moves on to the ancient Greeks to show how they bestowed the gift of philosophy at a time when thinkers still assigned a high premium to the love of wisdom and believed that there was nothing the human mind could not grasp. When these two worlds courted during the early Hellenistic period and finally wed with the coming of Christianity during the high tide of the Greco-Roman world, we had the birth of Judeo-Christian civilization. This fusion created and sustained the values we lived by until the day before yesterday. Advertisement
But the Judeo-Christian worldview brought more than rules to live by. It made the practice of science as we know it possible and even inevitable — which will come as news to those who sophisticatedly assume that faith and reason have always been enemies. Indeed, Shapiro credits the intellectual ferment of the Middle Ages with eventually ushering in the scientific revolution from the 16th to the 18th centuries. And he is particularly adept at countering the expedient misconceptions propagated by secularists who have held that never the twain shall meet — such as the notion that all men of science were anti-religious martyrs to truth, when most, with few exceptions, from Copernicus to Francis Bacon to Newton, were men of faith who understood that their beliefs did not preclude their ability to practice science. Even the woes of Galileo, the chief martyr, are shown to have been not nearly as woeful as we have been led to believe. Advertisement Advertisement
But this book isn’t an intellectual survey alone, nor is such a survey its central purpose. Shapiro is out to reclaim a legacy. He never tires of taking us back again and again to the nexus between ideas and life, tracing the seeds of rebellion from good sense to somewhere in the 17th century with Hobbes and Spinoza, on through the brilliantly cloying influences of Voltaire and Rousseau and the murderous French Revolution they partially wrought, past Hume and Kant and on to the growls of smoldering dissent in the 19th century, from Hegel to Marx, after which the bottom drops out, and the Judeo-Christian tradition that built Western civilization is put permanently on a defensive footing. Enter then the more modern miscreants, the folks who have laid the foundations for sundry varieties of utopianism and heterodoxy and whose ruinous ideas we are saddled with today: Freud, John Dewey, Sartre, and even Dr. Benjamin Spock. Advertisement Advertisement
Shapiro reserves his heavier artillery, though, for those lapses from tradition and civilization that have been pushed to direst effect by the political machinations of men with more obscure names, such as Antonio Gramsci, Max Horkheimer, Theodor Adorno, Erich Fromm, and Herbert Marcuse. The influence of the last can be felt every day somewhere on almost every college and university campus in the West, from redrawn curricula fitted to political stances to shout-downs of speakers who challenge the reigning dogmas. Anybody who doesn’t know these figures should make their acquaintance. They have changed the cultural air we breathe. "
Robert Mueller's Report Release: Congress was a Better Forum | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Michael Brendan Dougherty,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/william-barr-report-release-congress-was-a-better-forum/,"Follow Michael Brendan Dougherty on Twitter April 18, 2019 10:59 AM
Watching the extreme reactions of reporters and journalists to Attorney General Bill Barr’s conference, including accusations of cover-up and citing his press conference as evidence of our nation’s descent into an authoritarian junta, my mind leapt back to an argument between Rich Lowry and David French on the proper forum for the kind of investigation Robert Mueller was doing.

French argued that it was fine for a department of the executive branch — created by Congress to enforce federal law — to investigate the president for violations of that law. Lowry argued that the role of investigating the president more properly belonged to Congress."
The Constitution Was Never Pro-Slavery | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Allen C. Guelzo,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/magazine/2019/05/06/the-constitution-was-never-pro-slavery/,"April 18, 2019 11:14 AM (VisionsOfAmerica/Joe Sohm) It was deliberately written to avoid establishing a legal precedent for ownership of human beings
I n the world of the woke, the U.S. Constitution is, simply on its face, a document of racial oppression. No one less than Bernie Sanders has declared that the United States is “a nation” that in “many ways was created, and I’m sorry to have to say this, from way back, on racist principles.” Others are less sorry. Paul Finkelman, president of Gratz College in Philadelphia, argues that the Constitution deliberately intended to protect slavery, principally through its provisions for interstate extradition of fugitives from “service” (Art. 4 IV, Sec. 2), through the notorious three-fifths clause in Article I, Section 2, which allowed states to count three-fifths of their slave populations toward representation in Congress, and through the 20-year free pass given to the slave trade (Art. I, Sec. 9). Advertisement Advertisement
In fact, for Finkelman, that’s only the beginning of the Constitution’s love affair with slavery. Other offenses include the ban on export taxes in Article I, Section 9 (written to give the products of slave labor an open trade door); the limitation of “privileges and immunities” to “citizens” in Article IV, Section 2 (since slaves could not be “citizens”); the “full faith and credit” requirement between states in Article IV, Section 1 (this required recognition of legalized slavery everywhere in the nation); the power of “calling forth the Militia” to “supress insurrections” in Article I, Section 8 (these “insurrections” could naturally refer only to slave insurrections); and, of course, the Electoral College, since its formula for determining electors was swollen by the numbers of “three-fifths” slaves who would be counted and thus granted slave states an extra advantage in electing presidents.
This is the reasoning that leads David Waldstreicher of the City University of New York to claim that “of the 11 clauses in the Constitution that deal with or have policy implications for slavery, 10 protect slave property and the powers of masters. Only one, the international slave-trade clause, points to a possible future power by which, after 20 years, slavery might be curtailed — and it didn’t work out that way at all.” Even George Van Cleve, the most dispassionate advocate of the “pro-slavery Constitution,” concludes (in A Slaveholders’ Union ) that the Constitution “was pro-slavery in its politics, its economics, and its law.” By these reckonings, the Constitution would have ensured slavery’s perpetuation into the indefinite future had it not been for the fatal intervention of a civil war.

What often comes next is a demand to rid the Constitution of the vestigial props for slavery that have somehow survived into our times, usually beginning with the Electoral College. Or maybe, as with University of Texas law professor Sanford Levinson, it leads to a call for junking the whole “We the People” business and starting over with a new constitutional convention.
The accusing finger that links slavery and the Constitution would have surprised no one more than the delegates to the Constitutional Convention. At the outbreak of the Revolution, every one of the newly independent states had legalized slavery. (The numbers varied widely from place to place: Georgia had 18,000 slaves, Pennsylvania 6,000, Virginia 200,000, Massachusetts 5,200, and New York 17,000.) Advertisement Advertisement
But opinion about the moral legitimacy of slavery was shifting. Benjamin Franklin bought and sold slaves in colonial Philadelphia, but by 1772 he had begun denouncing slavery as “a constant butchery of the human species” and the slave trade as a “pestilential, detestable traffic in the bodies and souls of men.” New York founded a Manumission Society in 1785, while the Virginia Gazette in 1782 asked the Revolution’s most logical question: “Whilst we are spilling our blood and exhausting our treasure in defence of our own liberty, it would not perhaps be amiss, to turn our eyes towards those of our fellow men now in bondage under us. We say, ‘all men are equally entitled to liberty and the pursuit of happiness’ but are we willing to grant this liberty to all men?”
That question was also being asked among the members of the Constitutional Convention when it assembled in Philadelphia in May 1787. Of the Convention’s 55 delegates, 26 were slaveowners, most of them from southern states — Maryland, Virginia, South Carolina, Georgia — but a smattering from New York, New Jersey, and Delaware. Still, many were uneasy with the thought of giving slavery a continued lease on life in the new republic. James Madison, who was the prime mover behind the Convention, had long wondered whether emancipation “would certainly be more consonant to the principles of liberty,” and, though the Madison family depended on slave labor, he hoped “to depend as little as possible on the labour of slaves.” When a slave who accompanied him to Congress in Philadelphia in 1783 refused to return with Madison to Virginia, Madison simply apprenticed him to a Philadelphia Quaker, since he “cannot think of punishing him . . . merely for coveting that liberty for which we have paid the price of so much blood, and have proclaimed so often to be the right, & worthy the pursuit, of every human being.” Advertisement
It was not, however, until August 8, well into the deliberations, that the issue erupted on the floor of the Convention. In the midst of the ongoing debate over representation in the new Congress, the Convention was ready to agree to the formula used for Congress in the Articles of Confederation (the three-fifths ratio) when Rufus King of New York objected. “The admission of slaves” into a formula for representation “was a most grating circumstance to his mind” and would only encourage slaveowners to import more slaves, according to the Convention’s minutes. He was seconded by the raffish Gouverneur Morris, who attacked slavery wholesale as “a nefarious institution” that had “the curse of heaven on the States where it prevailed.” Slavery was “a sacrifice of every principle of right, of every impulse of humanity,” and Morris ringingly declared that “he would sooner submit himself to a tax for paying for all the negroes in the U. States, than saddle posterity with such a Constitution.” Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement
Morris drew an immediate response from South Carolina’s John Rutledge, who warned that “religion & humanity had nothing to do with this question.” If the Convention wanted to meddle with slavery, then the “question” would become “whether the Southn. States shall or shall not be parties to the Union.” Anxiously, other members sought to seal the breach. Connecticut’s Roger Sherman hastily assured Rutledge that “he disapproved of the slave trade; yet as the States were now possessed of the right to import slaves, . . . he thought it best to leave the matter as we find it.” But this concession was worth making because it actually offered so little. Slavery, Sherman insisted, was dying out on its own: “The abolition of Slavery seemed to be going on in the U.S.” and “the good sense of the several States would probably by degrees compleat it.” Oliver Ellsworth agreed. “As population increases poor laborers will be so plenty as to render slaves useless,” so that “slavery in time will not be a speck in our Country.” Advertisement
But later that month, slavery reappeared in debate — although it now came in the form of a deal aimed at allaying the hostility of King and Morris toward importing slaves. Congress would be empowered to tax slave imports and, after 1808, prohibit slave importation completely (although the wording of the provision gently tiptoed around using the term “slave”). An additional provision made the extradition of fugitive slaves a state obligation — although again gingerly applying it to all “those held to service” rather than to slaves . On the surface, a great compromise appeared to have been struck, and southerners went home congratulating themselves that they had “a security that the general government can never emancipate [slaves], . . . for no such authority is granted.”
But they missed the big picture. As Roger Sherman insisted, the Constitution might contain concessions to the states regarding the existence of slavery, but nothing in it acknowledged “men to be property.” As “dishonorable to the National character” as the concessions were, added James Madison, it would be intolerable “to admit in the Constitution the idea that there could be property in men.” And so the fundamental basis on which the entire notion of slavery rested was barred at the Constitution’s door, even while its practical existence slipped through.
J ust how much distance the Framers wished to put between slavery and the new Constitution emerged even before the Convention adjourned. On July 13, 1787, the final Congress under the Articles of Confederation, sitting in New York, adopted the Northwest Ordinance as the instrument for organizing the territory ceded by Great Britain around the Great Lakes. The Ordinance’s sixth section provided that “there shall be neither slavery nor involuntary servitude in the said territory, otherwise than in the punishment of crimes whereof the party shall have been duly convicted.” The Ordinance did not at once liberate slaves living in the Northwest (especially the slaves belonging to old French colonial families along the Mississippi River), but it did turn the face of the future away from slavery.
As the Constitution moved toward ratification, one member of the Massachusetts ratifying convention recognized the same dynamic at work in the new federal instrument. “It would not do to abolish slavery . . . in a moment,” conceded Bostonian Thomas Dawes (whose cousin, William, had ridden with Paul Revere). Nevertheless, even if “slavery is not smitten with an apoplexy, yet it has received a mortal wound and will die of a consumption.” And the Pennsylvania abolitionist Benjamin Rush rejoiced that, by refusing to include slavery or “ slaves in this constitution,” the Framers had saved the republic from “the very words” that “would contaminate the glorious fabric of American liberty and government.” The “cloud” of anti-slavery, “which a few years ago was no larger than a man’s hand, has descended in plentiful dews and at last cover’d every part of our land.”
And so it seemed. The new Congress created by the Constitution was in a constant ferment from petitions “teasing and pestering them with something about slavery,” and one Georgia representative grumbled that “it was the fashion of the day to favor the liberty of slaves.” In its first three decades, Congress received proposals to tax slave imports, impose regulations (including prohibitions on the use of American ports or shipyards for equipping slave ships) on the slave trade, extend the Northwest Ordinance’s ban on slavery to the Mississippi territory, and impose gradual emancipation on the Louisiana territory (after its acquisition under Thomas Jefferson in 1803), as well as petitions to “undo the heavy burthens, and prepare the way for the oppressed to go free, that every yoke may be broken.” When truculent slaveowners tried to insist that “slaves are property . . . by the Constitution guaranteed,” John Quincy Adams just as truculently replied that “the Constitution does not recognize slavery — it contains no such word.” In fact, “a great circumlocution of words is used merely to avoid the term slaves .” Any argument that would make the Constitution a pro-slavery document has, on the evidence of the Framers’ generation, quite a boulder to roll up the hill. Advertisement
B ut rolling that boulder was what slaveholders nearly accomplished in the generation after the Framing, and they did so not because the Constitution sanctioned slavery but because of cotton. South Carolina’s prime champion of slavery, John Caldwell Calhoun, conceded that “many in the South once believed that it was a moral and political evil.” But times had changed, and they had changed largely because cotton — the preeminent commodity grown by slave labor in the American South — had been transformed by the Industrial Revolution into the white gold of the transatlantic economy. As late as 1809, cotton was only a secondary crop for southern agriculture; on the eve of the Civil War, it accounted for 27.5 percent of all United States exports and 57.7 percent of agricultural exports.
The South now saw slavery “in its true light,” Calhoun said, and regarded it as “the most safe and stable basis for free institutions in the world.” In the kingdom of cotton, the Constitution was a relic. Guarantees of free speech and a free press were disregarded in the South. Anyone who proposed a discussion of slavery, wrote Alvan Stewart, an anti-slavery lawyer, “may then provoke a syllogism of feathers, or a deduction of tar.” Missouri senator Thomas Hart Benton congratulated mobs that attacked abolitionists for exerting “a vigor beyond all law,” saying that “they had obeyed the enactments not of the statutebook, but of the heart.” And so long as he agreed with their spirit, “he cared nothing for laws written in a book.” In 1836, the Virginia legislature adopted a statute decreeing the imprisonment of any member of anti-slavery society so unwary as to enter the Old Dominion. That same year, Calhoun proposed a post-office bill that would have allowed postmasters to destroy abolitionist publications — only to have it fail, narrowly, by a vote of 19 to 25 in the Senate. They were more successful in passing a “gag rule” to prevent the reading of anti-slavery petitions in the House of Representatives. The resolution stayed in force until 1844.
In the southern argument, the states were “as independent of each other as they were before the Constitution was formed,” and in some places even more so. South Carolina, declared one state legislator, was no longer a republic but an oligarchy, “an odious cunning, tyrannical intriguing oligarchy,” determined to “rule or ruin every man who tries to think, speak or act for himself. Not that this departure from constitutional government was seriously opposed; to the contrary, it was the wave of the future.”
“The time must come,” warned Thomas Roderick Dew in 1836, when slavery would rescue the nation from its outdated laws. “Domestic slavery, such as ours, is the only institution which I know of, that can secure that spirit of equality among freemen, so necessary to the true and genuine feeling of republicanism.”
But slavery’s opponents just as vigorously demanded recognition of the Constitution’s anti-slavery import. Senator William Henry Seward of New York defended the Constitution as the shrine of “perpetual, organic, universal” freedom; slavery had only a “temporary, accidental, partial and incongruous” presence in it, and only because slavery had the protection of state, not federal law. The Constitution devotes “the national domain” to “union, to justice, to defense, to welfare and liberty” — not to slavery. Ohio governor Salmon Chase (who was known as the “attorney general for fugitive slaves”) declared that “the founders of the Republic in framing our institutions, were careful to give no national sanction” to slavery; “all recognition of the rightfulness of slaveholding, and all national sanction of the practice, was carefully excluded from the instrument.”
Above all, Abraham Lincoln, in his great Cooper Union speech in February 1860, appealed to the Framers as proof that the Constitution “marked” slavery “as an evil not to be extended, but to be tolerated and protected only, because of and so far as its actual presence among us makes that toleration and protection a necessity.” Far from justifying slaveholding as a right, “the Constitution . . . is literally silent about any such right,” and any impartial inspection of the Constitution “will show that the right of property in a slave is not ‘distinctly and expressly affirmed’ in it.” Like Madison, Lincoln resisted the “idea” that “the Constitution” sanctioned the pretense “that there could be property in man.” Advertisement
And when push came to shove, the slaveholders conceded the point. They seceded from the Union and wrote the kind of constitution the Framers had not written, one declaring at last that “no . . . law denying or impairing the right of property in negro slaves shall be passed.”
T o read the Constitution as pro-slavery, in the manner of Finkelman, Waldstreicher, and even Sanders, requires a suspension of disbelief that only playwrights and morticians could admire. Yes, the Constitution reduced slaves to the hated three-fifths; but that was to keep slaveholders from claiming them for five-fifths in determining representation, which would have increased the power of the slaveholding states. Yes, the Constitution permitted the slave trade to continue; but it also permitted Congress to shut it off, which it did in 1808. Yes, the Constitution banned export taxes, required “full faith and credit,” and limited “privileges and immunities” to citizens. But the debates over those provisions betrayed no inkling that the hidden subject was slavery. And the accusation that the militia clause was meant to suppress slave insurrections was actually only a speculation tossed off at one moment of energetic accusation by Gouverneur Morris, not a deliberately conceived strategy by scheming slaveholders.
Smearing the Constitution by characterizing it as a contract for the perpetuation of slavery is worse than trying to see as half empty a glass that’s half full; it is to see as bone dry a glass that’s nearly full, or even to see no glass at all. As the late Don Fehrenbacher wrote in The Slaveholding Republic (2002), “the Constitution as it came from the hands of the framers dealt only minimally and peripherally with slavery.” Its authors, even when they turned a blind eye to slavery, did so believing that “slavery would disappear” and that “the imprint of that expectation is visible in the document they finally approved.”"
Robert Mueller Report Debunk's Buzzfeed's Michael Cohen Testimony Story | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Jack Crowe,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/news/robert-mueller-report-refutes-buzzfeed-claim-that-trump-directed-cohen-to-lie-to-congress/,"Follow Jack Crowe on Twitter April 18, 2019 1:51 PM Michael Cohen testifies before a House Committee on Oversight and Reform hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., February 27, 2019. (Carlos Barria/Reuters)
Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report contradicts a high-profile Buzzfeed News story that indicated Mueller’s team had evidence President Trump directed Michael Cohen to lie to Congress.
Cohen pled guilty to lying to Congress last year after it was revealed that he told lawmakers that conversations about the construction of a Moscow Trump Tower ended in January 2016, when they actually continued for months thereafter and involved Trump personally.
A January 18 Buzzfeed story claimed that Cohen told the Mueller’s team that Trump “personally instructed him” to mislead lawmakers “in order to obscure Trump’s involvement” in the Moscow Trump Tower project.
Buzzfeed touted Cohen’s supposed testimony as “the first known example of Trump explicitly telling a subordinate to lie directly about his own dealings with Russia.”
The report’s authors claimed the special counsel learned of Trump’s directive through “interviews with multiple witnesses from the Trump Organization and internal company emails, text messages, and a cache of other documents” and later from Cohen himself.
Mueller’s report , however, directly refutes those claims. Stay Updated with NR Daily
NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.
“Cohen said that he and the President did not explicitly discuss whether Cohen’s testimony about the Trump Tower Moscow project would be or was false, and the President did not direct him to provide false testimony. Cohen also said he did not tell the President about the specifics of his planned testimony,” the report reads.
Mueller’s team did acknowledge in the report that Trump knew Cohen’s testimony was false but stipulated that the “evidence available to us does not establish that the President directed or aided Cohen’s false testimony.”"
Robert Mueller Report Release: Democrats Must Move On | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Kevin D. Williamson,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/robert-mueller-report-release-should-have-democrats-moving-on/,"April 18, 2019 1:19 PM President Donald Trump in the East Room of the White House in Washington, D.C., April 18, 2019 (Lucas Jackson/Reuters)
Some of you will be familiar with a lefty, partisan Democratic organization called MoveOn, formerly MoveOn.Org. It was founded during an investigation into President Bill Clinton’s shenanigans (which were not, Democratic mythology notwithstanding, strictly sexual in nature) and argued that it was time for the country to “move on” from the Clinton scandals. Congress disagreed, and impeached President Clinton. Advertisement Advertisement
The investigation into the Trump campaign’s relationships with various foreign actors and into the president’s possible obstruction of justice has come to a conclusion, and that conclusion is that there was no criminal collusion and insufficient evidence to support an obstruction prosecution. In a reasonable world, this would be the obvious time to move on. Of course the Democrats believe, or want to believe, that there is unfinished business here. Some Republicans do, too, and would like an investigation into whether the investigation was improper and whether investigators acted improperly.
It does not seem to me that the investigation was entirely without basis, and it does seem that the reasonable conclusion here is to concede that there was smoke (maybe just the smell of smoke) but no fire, that some of Trump’s actions may have been unseemly but that there’s no law against unseemliness — and that treating criticism of an investigation as potential obstruction of justice comes queasily close to arguing that to defend one’s self from an accusation is a confession of guilt."
Samuel Johnson & 'The Club' Book Review | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,John J. Miller,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/magazine/2019/05/06/the-club-book-review-samuel-johnsons-world/,"April 18, 2019 11:05 AM A literary party at Sir Joshua Reynolds’ by D. George Thompson (National Portrait Gallery)
I n the famous dictionary he published in 1755, Samuel Johnson defined a “club” as “an assembly of good fellows, meeting under certain conditions.” Nine years later, in 1764, the lexicographer became a founder of the Club, with a capital C. Its good fellows met under these conditions: They gathered one evening each week near the Strand in London, where they took a private room at the Turk’s Head Tavern, ordered food and wine, and conversed about topics great and small. Members “had to be good company — ready to talk, laugh, drink, eat, and argue until late into the night,” writes Leo Damrosch in The Club , an ambitious, multi-part biography of their lives and times. Advertisement
The Club was no ordinary collection of drinking buddies. Rather, it represented an astonishing assembly of talent and accomplishment. Members included Johnson as well as James Boswell, Edmund Burke, Edward Gibbon, and Adam Smith. These five, according to Damrosch, were “arguably the greatest British critic, biographer, political philosopher, historian, and economist of all time.” The Club’s second-tier members also were extraordinary: David Garrick, the greatest actor of the age; Joshua Reynolds, a top painter; and Oliver Goldsmith and Richard Brinsley Sheridan, two of the era’s most successful playwrights. Men of this caliber of intellectual and cultural firepower have congregated only rarely, in places such as classical Athens, Renaissance Florence, and, coincidentally, in Philadelphia at roughly the same time as Johnson’s group.
Who wouldn’t want to eavesdrop on the Club’s conversations? Imagine Johnson and Garrick debating the art of Shakespeare. Or Boswell and Reynolds discussing the differences between written and visual portraiture. Or Burke and Smith — a pair of thinkers whose ideas echo loudly in today’s conservative movement — chatting about just about anything. That’s the implicit promise of Damrosch’s book. “The Club is the virtual hero of this story,” writes the author, a retired professor of literature at Harvard University. Yet this organizing principle turns out to be a curious weakness. Although the members of the Club left behind a massive record of books, essays, and speeches, almost nothing remains of what they said when they met in person. There are no transcripts. Only occasionally did one of them jot down the remarks of another. We have a star-studded cast, but there’s no script. Advertisement
Damrosch solves this problem by shifting his attention away from the specific activities of the Club and onto the amply documented friendship of Johnson and Boswell. They were an impressive duo, and The Club is essentially about them, with several tangents into the lives of their compatriots. This is well-trod ground, starting with Boswell’s own Life of Johnson and running through a long list of biographies that focus on one, the other, or the two together. Do we really need a new account of this old story? Perhaps. “When a man is tired of London, he is tired of life,” Johnson once said. It’s also hard to tire of Johnson, a dazzling wit who shaped the way we think about language and literature. Boswell, too, is a good subject. He was a pioneer in the art of biography and a dutiful diarist, whose revealing journals comprise more than a dozen volumes.
The world of Johnson is so rich that scholars have given it a name: Johnsoniana. There’s even a subfield: Boswelliana. Yet the map of their lives contains a few frustrating areas of terra incognita. Writers have had little to say about the friendship between Johnson and Burke, for example. Both were founding members of the Club, belonging to it for about a decade before Boswell, Gibbon, and Smith joined. They enjoyed a long connection, shared many interests, and were mutually admiring. Johnson was a hard man to impress, but he had the highest regard for Burke: “You could not stand five minutes with that man beneath a shed while it rained, but you must be convinced you had been standing with the greatest man you had ever seen.” The only thing that he may not have liked about his fellow Clubber was Burke’s fondness for groan-inducing puns. One time, for example, Burke sat near a ham. “I am Ham-Burke ,” he said, punning on the name of Hamburg, the German city. In recounting the incident, Damrosch says the most charitable thing possible: “You had to be there.” Advertisement Advertisement
This is the fundamental obstacle for any biographer who seeks to describe the friendship of Johnson and Burke: You had to have been there. They might have engaged in some of the greatest conversations in history, but we just don’t know, because conversations are ephemeral. Unless someone records them, they vanish like wisps of smoke. To compensate for their disappearance, Damrosch offers a brief biography of Burke, but it fails to show why Burke deserved Johnson’s profound admiration. Part of the problem may be Damrosch’s garden-variety liberalism. Today’s conservatives honor Burke as one of their intellectual heroes, largely for his authorship of Reflections on the Revolution in France , which warned against the chaos of mobs and the abandonment of tradition. Damrosch tries to push back, scolding American conservatives for having “idealized Burke as their foundational thinker” when the radical Thomas Paine mattered more to the Founding Fathers. Damrosch goes to great pains to make this point — or great Paines, to use a Burkean pun — but he seems unfamiliar with the writings of Peter Stanlis, Russell Kirk, and Yuval Levin. They’re nowhere in the footnotes, even though their work is indispensable to an understanding of Burke’s brand of conservatism and what American conservatives see in it. Advertisement Advertisement
Damrosch’s coverage of Smith is also a letdown, though in this case his characters hobble him. The introverted author of The Wealth of Nations was a “strangely recessive” member of the Club. When he was elected to it in 1775, Boswell, his former student in Edinburgh, grumbled that the Club had “lost its selective merit.” Johnson was sharper: Smith, he said, was “as dull a dog as he had ever met with.” The animosities at the Club extended to others as well: “Johnson and Boswell both loathed Gibbon,” writes Damrosch. In this instance, at least, their ire is rooted in disdain for what they perceived as anti-Christian views in Gibbon’s magnum opus, The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire . So here’s a substantial disagreement, and the prospect of rhetorical fireworks, but the fact remains that we just don’t know much about what Johnson, Boswell, and Gibbon said to one other at the Turk’s Head Tavern. Advertisement
With so little to report about what really happened at meetings of the Club, Damrosch turns not only to potted biographies of great men but also to what he calls Johnson’s “shadow club” or “second club.” This was the social circle that surrounded Hester Thrale, who became something of a patron to Johnson. She was also a devoted diarist, and if Boswell never had lived, her writings would serve as the favorite source of Johnson’s biographers. Even with Boswell’s biography, Thrale offers a unique contribution. Boswell, writes Damrosch, “felt a jealous rivalry with Hester for Johnson’s affection.” He essentially ignores her in The Life of Johnson , and she has much to say that Boswell doesn’t. Advertisement Advertisement
Thrale has provided anecdotes and insights into everything from Johnson’s method of composition to his mental health. He clearly suffered from what people in the 18th century called “melancholy.” Our word for it is “depression,” and Johnson’s case seems to have been severe. It may also be linked to his brilliance, making him a quintessential case of a tortured genius.
The torture was literal, according to Katharine C. Balderston, the editor of Thrale’s diary (known as — wait for it — Thraliana ). In 1949, Balderston described Johnson as a victim of “erotic maladjustment.” She continued: “His compulsive fantasy assumed a masochistic form, in which the impulse to self-abasement and pain predominated.” In other words, Mrs. Thrale padlocked Johnson and beat him with rods in acts of sexual perversion. Provocative claims require compelling proof, and in this case the evidence is thin. Most Johnson scholars have rejected it, including W. Jackson Bate, Peter Martin, and John Wain. Damrosch, however, accepts Balderston’s theory without hesitation. That’s fine, but beyond labeling her original article “controversial,” he doesn’t indicate to readers that this wild speculation is in fact a minority opinion.
Elsewhere, Damrosch makes better observations and wiser judgments. He marvels at the “remarkable” fluke that both Johnson and Garrick hailed from Lichfield, a small city near Birmingham, and they were buried beside each other in the Poets’ Corner of Westminster Abbey. Damrosch also endorses Johnson’s own belief that if he hadn’t quit Oxford for lack of funds, he might have disappeared into the mire of academia, never to be heard from again. Johnson instead moved to Grub Street, the traditional home of Londoners who scribbled for a living. Damrosch goes on to suggest that Johnson should have tried a medium that was just starting to catch on: “In hindsight it’s clear that the best path to success would have been as a novelist.” Unfortunately for fans of the novel, Johnson disliked the form."

(Phil Noble/Reuters) Heaven on Earth: The Rise, Fall, and Afterlife of Socialism , by Joshua Muravchik (Encounter Books 424 pp., $18.99)
T he volume here reviewed is the second edition of a book first published in 2002. I reviewed it favorably (with some reservations) in 2003. A good case can be made for the new edition, given the survival of socialist ideals and the persisting disagreements about their nature and realizability. It remains of interest why people in different parts of the world are still attracted to these ideals and why the same ideals have been so difficult to implement. Of special interest is what Joshua Muravchik calls the “afterlife” of socialism — what happened to these ideals and political aspirations after the political systems supposedly dedicated to their realization, such as the Soviet Union, ceased to exist.

As the reader is informed in the preface, the new edition is largely unchanged, except for the addition of an epilogue, some updating of the chapter on the kibbutzim (collective farms of modern Israel), and the correction of small errors.
The difficulty of coming to grips with the subject — that is, the proper understanding of the nature of socialist ideals and their realizability — has not diminished since the book was first published. The problem begins with the widely held, undifferentiated views of socialism shared by most Americans. They are unaware of the fundamental differences between authoritarian (or totalitarian) state socialism embedded in one-party systems, such as the former Soviet one or the Chinese one under Mao, and social-democratic societies, such as those in Scandinavia. The latter are politically liberal and pluralistic and seek to reduce economic inequalities through high taxes and a range of social services. It is this ignorance of the deep moral and institutional gulf between these two very different political systems that allowed President Trump to hold forth about the horrors of socialism without specifying whether he had in mind the Soviet Gulag or child care in Sweden. By the same token, it is also incumbent on the new, young Democratic representatives in Congress who sing the praises of socialism to make clear that they are aware of the morally decisive differences between democratic socialism and the repressive one-party states calling themselves “socialist.” Advertisement
Since one-party-state socialist systems largely succeeded in usurping the “socialist” designation, it might have been wiser in this new edition to either completely eliminate or greatly reduce the discussion of British social democracy (i.e., the chapters on Atlee and Blair). On the other hand, if it was the author’s intention to present different approaches toward the realization of socialist ideals, the durable democratic socialism of the Scandinavian countries should have been included. Advertisement
Important conceptual distinctions are further obscured when under the same heading (“Triumphs”) we find chapters on Lenin’s seizure of power, Mussolini’s “socialism,” British social democracy under Atlee, and Nyerere’s African socialism. It is also unclear why a chapter on conflicts within the American trade-union movement was put in the part entitled “Collapse,” along with chapters on Deng and Gorbachev, Tony Blair, and the kibbutz. Advertisement
The volume might have been made more coherent by clearly separating the discussion of socialist ideals from the historical attempts to realize them, whether in small utopian communities, social-democratic countries, or authoritarian one-party states.
Apart from these structural-organizational problems, the book remains an informative introduction to the attempts to create socialist systems or communities variously conceived. Especially interesting is the chapter on the kibbutz, a unique experiment in creating, without coercion, utopian communities that had an authentic socialist — that is to say, egalitarian — inspiration. Advertisement
It is the attempted updating by means of the epilogue that is the least satisfactory. The “afterlife” of socialism, its continued appeal and divergent interpretations, and the unforeseen consequences of its attempted realization, cannot be adequately dealt with in a brief epilogue. There have been developments in this century that deserve attention and that this epilogue did not, and could not, address. They include the political disposition and influence of some prominent Western intellectuals — Alain Badiou, Noam Chomsky, Stephen F. Cohen, Angela Davis, José Saramago, and Slavoj Zizek, among others — who still cling to certain socialist ideals or seek to revive them. The afterlife of socialism cannot be reduced to the toxic disposition of Jeremy Corbyn of Britain or the more benign concerns and misconceptions of our Bernie Sanders — two figures (and their supporters) who dominate the epilogue. A particularly important phenomenon overlooked is the alienation of left-leaning young people in affluent, pluralistic Western societies and similar sentiments among the new right-wing populists. The former know little about the repression, regimentation, and scarcities that prevailed in the state-socialist systems. This ignorance makes it easier to harbor illusions about the sense of community attributed even to the remaining authoritarian socialist societies. Many of these young people are anti-capitalist because they associate capitalism with selfishness, impersonality, and lack of community more than with social injustices. Advertisement
Arguably, it is the “afterlife” that brought us right-wing populism, especially among the white working classes and older people similarly concerned with loss of community, weak social bonds, and meaninglessness. It seems to me that the central, shared grievance of the “new New leftists” and the right-wing populists can be traced to modernity (in its familiar capitalist incarnation): that is, to social isolation, secularization, and the loss of meaning. The populist nationalism and glorification of the past are pathways to a hoped-for restoration of community and stable moral values that modernity has undermined."

The Mueller Report and Special-Counsel Investigations | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,The Editors,04-19-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/mueller-report-special-counsel-investigations/,"About The Editors April 19, 2019 12:22 AM Attorney General William Barr, flanked by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, speaks at a news conference to discuss Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report in Washington, D.C., April 18, 2019. (Jonathan Ernst/Reuters)
S o much for collusion. The media conversation has now officially moved on from the obsession of the last two years to obstruction of justice.
That’s because the first volume of the voluminous Mueller report, the half devoted to what was supposed to be the underlying crime of a Trump conspiracy with Russia, came up completely empty. It tells us very little that’s new. There’s no particularly sinister information about Carter Page, the bit player the FBI repeatedly told the FISA court was probably a Russian agent. The operators who portrayed themselves as closest to WikiLeaks or Russia were usually braggarts and liars exaggerating their importance. Nothing came of the infamous Trump Tower meeting. Paul Manafort wasn’t at the center of conspiracy between the campaign and Russia, but operating in his greedy self-interest. Advertisement Advertisement
The Trump campaign was amateurish and without scruple in exploiting the WikiLeaks disclosures, but we all could have agreed on that long ago, without a years-long special-counsel investigation. Indeed, given how unlikely collusion always was and how far the evidence gathered by Mueller is from showing it, one wonders why the special counsel couldn’t have issued an interim report long ago, dispelling the persistent — and poisonous — idea that Trump was about to be proven a traitor.
The business end of the Mueller report is the second volume, on obstruction. The investigation ended up following the typical pattern of special-counsel probes on a much larger scale — fixating on process crimes even when there is no underlying offense. Only in this case, the target was the president of the United States. Advertisement
The report implicitly picks an argument with Attorney General William Barr over the question whether a president can obstruct justice in the course of exercising his lawful powers. We are inclined to Barr’s view that he can’t. Regardless, the case against Trump is ambiguous, as even Mueller acknowledges. Advertisement
The firing of FBI Director James Comey was almost certainly motivated by the president’s frustration that the FBI director wouldn’t say publicly that he wasn’t under investigation, indeed creating the opposite public impression. Some of Trump’s deceptions were for public consumption, not to influence the investigation. Trump’s attempts to fire Mueller and get then-attorney general Jeff Sessions to curtail the investigation came to nothing.
Finally, despite Trump’s hatred for the investigation, his White House cooperated with it fully. Advertisement
None of this is to deny the report’s distressing portrayal of how President Trump operates. He avoids potentially disastrous missteps, such as firing Mueller, when his aides ignore him and he fails to follow up. His dishonesty constantly creates dilemmas for those around him, forcing them to choose between lying for him or defying him. No president of the United States should ever applaud people for refusing to cooperate with prosecutors, or call someone who cooperates a “rat.” Most White House scandals involve presidents getting ill served by overly zealous, norm-defying advisers. In this episode, Trump flipped the script."

But What About . . .? | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Charles C. W. Cooke,04-19-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/but-what-about/,"David writes :
the idea that anyone is treating this report as “win” for Trump, given the sheer extent of deceptions exposed (among other things), demonstrates that the bar for his conduct has sunk so low that anything other than outright criminality is too often brushed aside as relatively meaningless.
I disagree. It is, in fact, a “win” for Trump. The central question in American politics over the last two years — and, indeed, the central question that the investigation into Russian interference gradually evolved to answer — was not “is Donald Trump a good person?” or “is Donald Trump a liar?” or “is Donald Trump fit to be president?” or even “does Donald Trump behave well when under investigation?” It was “is Donald Trump a traitor who colluded with the Russian government to steal the 2016 election, and if not, did his campaign do so on his behalf?” The answer to that question — to those question s , in fact — is a resounding “No.”"

1972 —Dissenting from the Supreme Court’s ruling in Sierra Club v. Morton that the Sierra Club lacks standing to challenge federal actions regarding a ski development, Justice William O. Douglas proposes “the conferral of standing upon environmental objects to sue for their own preservation.” The question of standing “would be simplified and also put neatly in focus if we fashioned a federal rule that allowed environmental issues to be litigated before federal agencies or federal courts in the name of the inanimate object about to be despoiled, defaced, or invaded.” Advertisement Advertisement
Under Douglas’s rule, these inanimate objects—“valleys, alpine meadows, rivers, lakes, estuaries, beaches, ridges, groves of trees, swampland, or even air that feels the destructive pressures of modern technology and modern life”—would be named parties. “The river as plaintiff speaks for the ecological unit of life that is part of it.” The “legitimate spokesmen” in court for the inanimate object would be “[t]hose who have [an] intimate relation with the inanimate object.” “Then there will be assurances that all of the forms of life which [the inanimate object] represents will stand before the court—the pileated woodpecker as well as the coyote and the bear, the lemmings as well as the trout in the streams.”
Needless to say, Justice Douglas is unconcerned by the massive increase in judicial power that would result from his proposed obliteration of constitutionally rooted restrictions on standing. Concerns about “government by the Judiciary” are insignificant, he says, in light of the inadequacies of Congress (“too remote” and “too ponderous”) and the federal agencies (“notoriously under the control of powerful interests”) in addressing the problem.

2016— Never has a more brazen and aggressive bureaucratic misreading of federal law encountered a more craven and confused judicial reception.
In G.G. v. Gloucester County School Board , a divided panel of the Fourth Circuit defers to the Obama administration’s radical claim that federal law requires any school that receives federal funding to make its single-sex restrooms, locker rooms, showers, housing, and sports teams available to “transgender students consistent with their gender identity.” Never mind that the Obama administration never actually interpreted the particular 1975 regulation in the manner that the panel majority imagined it owed deference to. Never mind that assigning facilities and programs on the basis of biological sex disregards—and thus clearly does not discriminate on the basis of —gender identity.
In August the Supreme Court will block the Fourth Circuit’s ruling from taking effect, and in late October it will grant the school board’s certiorari petition. In March 2017—after the incoming Trump administration repudiates the Obama’s reading of federal law—the Court will vacate the Fourth Circuit’s ruling and remand the case for further consideration.

On Tuesday, Talia Lavin took to its pages and actually wrote that Ben’s statements declaring Notre Dame to be a “ monument to Western civilization ” and a mark of the west’s “ Judeo-Christian heritage ” actually “ evoked the specter of war between Islam and the West. ” She then immediately compared his words to the depraved ideas of the New Zealand mosque shooter and alt-right leader Richard Spencer.

EDITOR’S NOTE: The following is Jonah Goldberg’s weekly “news”letter, the G-File. Subscribe here to get the G-File delivered to your inbox on Fridays.
D ear Reader ( R edacted : Harm to Ongoing Matter ),
One of the things I tell new parents is something that was told to me when my daughter still had that new-baby smell: “Prepare for long days but short years.” No statement more succinctly captures the exhaustion, excitement, and melancholy nostalgia that come with parenthood. I have no doubt whole books have not covered it more eloquently.
This week I had a similar sensation thinking about the two big news stories of the week: The fire at Notre Dame and the release of the Mueller report.
Time may be linear, but our comprehension of it isn’t. All around us events are taking place that we do not perceive as events because they are moving at a pace that we really can’t comprehend. Imagine if you could make a film of the planet earth from its birth to its demise. If you played the movie fast enough, the formation of mountains would look like terrifying clashes between continents. The breakup of Pangaea might look like a jigsaw puzzle thrown into a hot tub. Playing the film a million times slower would still probably make the rise and fall of ancient redwoods seem like nothing more than the instantaneous and momentary emergence of some colors on a canvass. Think of it this way: If you reduced the entire history of the planet to a 24-hour cycle, humans don’t even show up — some 2 million years ago — less than one minute before midnight.
Against such a backdrop, the Cathedral of Notre-Dame de Paris emerges and disappears too fast for the naked eye. As for the controversies about Donald Trump, never mind the Mueller report, they take up a fraction of time words cannot capture.
But if you slow things down enough for the mind to take it in, Notre Dame is like a mountain. Not quite eternal in a literal sense, but eternal enough by human standards. As I mentioned the other day, I once wrote and produced a documentary called Notre Dame: Witness to History (I don’t really recommend it; I wasn’t a great TV producer and I certainly didn’t have a great budget). The title was clichéd but accurate. Notre Dame was the central location for so much of French and really Western history, its scars and embellishments are almost like rings in an ancient tree recording whole eras of Western history. Signs of the Huguenots’ assault on the Church — and the Church’s assault on the Huguenots — can be found in its nooks and crannies like the tiny indicia of a plague of locusts in a bisection of an ancient oak. The last time the Spire burned, it was at the hands of the Jacobins who briefly turned Notre Dame into a “Temple of Reason.”
Putting History on a Stop Watch
I bring all this up for a few reasons, not least because the “process” for this “news”letter amounts to taking my brain pan and upending it like a kid emptying his toy chest in search of the Lego pieces required to build a time machine. The controversies of the day are important, but they are like the crises of parenthood: Hugely important in the moment, but likely to turn into the faintest squiggles in the tree rings of time. That’s not foreordained, of course. There are daily crises with your kids that can turn into existential ones — as anyone who’s taken their child to an emergency room can attest — which is one of the reasons the days of parenthood can feel so much longer than the years.
I’m not sure what the right terms are, but there’s an analogy here. Some controversies are important (and some are just incredibly stupid) but they are important in the moment alone. Others transcend the fierce urgency of now and apply across generations. For some, climate change is precisely such a challenge. For others, it is the civilizational friction between the Muslim world and the rest, or the rivalries between America and China. The Cold War was certainly larger than any confirmation battle or scandal.
The most worthwhile daily arguments are the ones that work within a timeline measured by more than 15-minute increments in a Nielsen report on last night’s cable ratings. For instance, Jussie Smollett’s transgressions are great for feeding the ratings beast, but they are only significant to the extent they illuminate the larger dysfunction of a culture that encourages racial hoaxes because we have turned victims into heroes. And even then, that context is usually used as a pretext just to keep jaw-jawing and preening for the perpetual outrage machine.
I’m the first to admit that it is hard to know where to draw the lines between seriousness and exploitation, or mere infotainment, particularly since this “news”letter darts back and forth across the borders like the Viet Cong running the Ho Chi Minh trail. But one of the things I despise about the current moment is how the Big Things are so often turned into just another Twitter controversy and the Small Things are elevated into existential crises of the first order.
President Trump, lacking anything like a historical memory, is fond of claiming that this or that outrage or accomplishment is the worst or best thing “ever.” “Our African American communities are absolutely in the worst shape they’ve ever been in before,” Trump declared in 2016. “Ever, ever, ever.” That might have been news to the Africans-Americans lynched in the 1920s or the Africans auctioned off in Charleston in the 1820s. I still laugh whenever I think about Sebastian Gorka ranting about the alleged FISA warrant abuses of the Obama administration. “It has to be put in the context of the history of our great nation,” he said in expert-mode. “This is 100 times bigger.” More recently he explained that the Democrats were a continuation of Stalinism because they’re coming for our hamburgers .
Western Civilization 0, Twitter 1
The other day Ben Shapiro offered what should have been an utterly banal statement about the fire at Notre Dame:
Now, I have no problem with quibbles (and neither does Ben) from Catholics who point out that Notre Dame was a monument to the glory of God and what Catholics believe to be the One True Church as delineated in the Nicene Creed. But, I doubt any of those Catholics took offense at what Ben said. And if they did, they should probably lighten up. I’d also point out that Cathedrals were the space programs of their day (“The Knights Templar were the first Space Force”: Discuss). Cities and nations constantly competed to see who could build the tallest Cathedral — which is why most are built on the tallest ground available. The idea was both theological and political. Theologically, the idea was to get as close to God as possible. Politically, it was a desire for, well, national greatness.
Anyway, what I have a huge problem with is the bonfire of asininity that ignited from people who think “Western civilization” is a term reserved solely for the alt-right and other bigots (David French addressed the point well here ). In a piece about Ben’s excellent book on Western civilization — I’ll reserve my quibbles for later — The Economist labeled him an “alt-right sage” and a “pop idol of the alt right.” To The Economist’s credit, they retracted and apologized. But the immediate assumption that praise for, or pride in, Western civilization is a species of bigotry and racism is a perfect example of the sort of civilizational suicide I describe in my own book on the subject .
So adamantine is this absurdity that some Shapiro haters actually assume he’s not actually saying he thinks the West is superior, only “tacitly” suggesting it.
Ben might as well be standing in the center of Times Square waving a giant foam finger that reads “Western Civ #1” on it. But the idea is so offensive to some people they think he wouldn’t dare say it outright.
What’s So Great about Western Civilization?
I’ve covered much of this at length — book length but also in this G-File — elsewhere. So I’ll go in a slightly different direction.
Forget calling it Western civilization for a moment. Instead think of a kind of party platform with a bunch of planks: Support for human rights Belief in the rule of law Dedication to democracy "
William Barr's Release of Mueller Report a Model of Transparency | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Deroy Murdock,04-19-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/mueller-report-release-william-barr-transparency/,"“Bill” Advertisement
Beyond that, Barr was obligated to do none of what he did on Thursday morning. He held a press conference at Justice Department headquarters, answered journalists’ questions, sent Congress redacted copies of Mueller’s 448-page “Report On The Investigation Into Russian Interference in the 2016 Presidential Election” (on CD-ROMs), made a nearly unredacted copy (minus only legally verboten grand-jury material) available for top congressional leaders to inspect, posted the document on DOJ’s public website, and freed Mueller to discuss his findings before Congress, as Democrats have demanded. Barr previously agreed to let the Senate and House judiciary committees grill him on, respectively, May 1 and 2. Advertisement Advertisement
Democrats have suggested that Barr has something to hide. As House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer of New York stated Wednesday, “The American people deserve to hear the truth .” In fact, Barr’s behavior has been clearer than a Brooks Brothers storefront window.
The White House has been equally see-through. While President Donald J. Trump ground his molars through this 22-month-long legal root canal, he let his lawyers hand Mueller some 1.4 million pages of records and allowed administration and campaign personnel to be interrogated. Trump never asserted executive privilege, nor did he request redactions in the report. Advertisement Advertisement
“The level of transparency, cooperation, production of documents, and waiver of privileges by the White House is stunning — as is the production of the barely-redacted Mueller report,” former federal prosecutor Sidney Powell told me. Powell, the author of Licensed to Lie : Exposing Corruption in the Department of Justice , added: “Obama invoked executive privilege to shut down any and every inquiry into obvious wrongdoing.”
Rather than an elaborate whitewash, Team Trump’s compliance undergirds this overarching conclusion: “Ultimately,” in Mueller’s words, “the investigation did not establish that the Campaign coordinated or conspired with the Russian government in its election-interference activities.”
Barr concurred. As he told journalists at DOJ: “After nearly two years of investigation, thousands of subpoenas, and hundreds of warrants and witness interviews, the Special Counsel confirmed that the Russian government sponsored efforts to illegally interfere with the 2016 presidential election but did not find that the Trump campaign or other Americans colluded in those schemes.” Advertisement
Did President Trump commit obstruction of justice? Mueller made no such charge and left that decision to Barr. The AG, Deputy AG Rod Rosenstein, the Office of Legal Counsel, and other federal prosecutors concluded that, in Barr’s words, the evidence is “not sufficient to establish that the President committed an obstruction-of-justice offense.” Barr also determined that “the President took no act that in fact deprived the Special Counsel of the documents and witnesses to complete his investigation.” Trump may have sat in the Oval Office and sworn like a New Yorker about the Russiagate inquiry , but he never blocked Mueller.
Mueller indicated that Trump’s written replies to some of his questions were “ inadequate ” because the president “does not ‘recall’ or ‘remember’ or have an ‘incomplete recollection.’” Mueller could have subpoenaed Trump for a face-to-face interview, “but,” he wrote, “at that point, our investigation had made significant progress and had produced substantial evidence for our report. We thus weighed the costs of potentially lengthy constitutional litigation, with resulting delay in finishing our investigation, as against the anticipated benefits of our investigation and report.” So, Mueller issued no such subpoena. Advertisement
Could Trump potentially have done more including, as attorneys call it, walk into a perjury trap? Perhaps. But, as it happens, Trump did exactly what he and Mueller agreed that Trump would do.
Of course, none of this satisfies the Trump haters. Nothing ever does.
First, they whined that Barr was taking too long to issue his summary of Mueller’s Friday, March 22, report.
When Barr’s brief emerged that Sunday, Democrats complained that his four-page abstract came too soon. “I must say, it is extraordinary to evaluate hundreds of pages of evidence, legal documents, and findings based on a 22-month long inquiry and make definitive legal conclusions in less than 48 hours,” said Representative Nita Lowey (D., N.Y.). “Even for someone who has done this job before, I would argue it is more suspicious than impressive.” Advertisement
Trump’s foes then moaned that Barr was not redacting Mueller’s full report quickly enough — surely to conceal Trump’s decades of service to the KGB. “They’re just dragging their feet and slow-rolling this thing so that Donald Trump can go around the country saying he was exonerated based on this ridiculous four-page letter that Barr issued,” said former Watergate prosecutor Nick Akerman .
But when Barr announced that he would release Mueller’s report on Thursday, that date needlessly rushed things. CNN’s Chris Cuomo called this “ dirty pool ” as yesterday was the eve of Good Friday and Passover. Presumably Mueller’s paper would vanish in a tsunami of chocolate bunnies and matzo. Advertisement
Had Barr waited until Monday, the Left would have slammed him for befouling the weekend of Judeo-Christian worship with unquenched national lust for the Mueller report. Advertisement
Democrats accused Barr of stealth. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D., N.Y.) described Barr’s handling of this matter as “ equivalent to a cover-up .” But when Barr announced plans for a pre-release news conference, five House committee chairmen insisted that Barr cancel the presser . Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer called this an “ indefensible plan to spin the report.”
Pelosi further kvetched that “the Trump team received a sneak preview” of Mueller’s study. True!
Barr was totally open about this, too:
In addition, earlier this week, the President’s personal counsel requested and were given the opportunity to read a final version of the redacted report before it was publicly released. That request was consistent with the practice followed under the Ethics in Government Act, which permitted individuals named in a report prepared by an Independent Counsel the opportunity to read the report before publication.
President Trump’s personal attorney, former New York City Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, Esq., told Fox News Channel how he, Jay Sekulow, and Jane and Marty Raskin managed their perfectly legal “sneak preview.”
“ We went to the Justice Department in a secure room. We couldn’t take it out, we couldn’t photograph it,” Giuliani said. “We read it, and we were going to originally divide it up, but decided we had to all read it and share our thoughts about it.” Trump’s lawyers also were allowed to take notes on what they perused.
Wow! How sneaky.
As President Trump’s enemies abandon their thoroughly debunked “Russia! Russia! Russia!” fantasy, they now chant “Obstruction! Obstruction! Obstruction!” Nothing satisfies them, so long as President Trump breathes."
Mueller Report Vindicates William Barr | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Andrew C. Mccarthy,04-19-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/mueller-report-vindicates-william-barr/,"April 19, 2019 3:59 PM Attorney General William Barr (Yuri Gripas/Reuters) Barr has provided Congress with the full, at times gory details drawn from Mueller’s aggressive investigation.
D emocrats and their media partners owe Bill Barr an apology. He won’t get one, it goes without saying.
Just to recap, the attorney general was accused of misrepresenting Mueller’s report; of providing a false summary of the report; of plotting to use grand-jury law and other secrecy provisions as a pretext to redact most of the report; and of calling an extraordinary press conference in order to exculpate the president by projecting a fraudulent version of the report. Advertisement Advertisement
These accusations were slanderously false.
Barr made Mueller’s bottom-line findings available on a Sunday, March 24, less than two full days after receiving the report from Mueller late on a Friday. Now that the 448-page tome is public, it is easy to see that it could not possibly have been redacted, in keeping with federal law, without a weeks-long review process.
If Barr had issued nothing while that painstaking process went on, he’d have been vilified for a cover-up. Instead, he quickly and accurately reported Mueller’s findings . . . and was of course vilified for purportedly lying about what the report said — notwithstanding that Mueller, no wallflower, was cooperating in the redaction process and would obviously not have abided a fictional account of his work. Advertisement
Barr’s brief account could not have been a false summary because he never undertook to summarize the report. He simply communicated Mueller’s bottom line — yes, Russia meddled; no, Trump was not complicit in a criminal conspiracy; and hand-wringing on obstruction, leaving it to Barr to make the final call. Advertisement
Barr maintained that it would violate federal law if he provided grand-jury material to Congress, so he would have to withhold it. Democrats went ballistic . . . but within days, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that grand-jury materials must be kept secret unless they fall under an exception prescribed in Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e) — which does not have an exception for disclosure to Congress. Instead of bloviating, Democrats could simply have proposed an amendment to Rule 6(e) that would have permitted the disclosure, but that would have been an implicit concession that Barr was right. They need Barr to be perceived as not just wrong but corrupt. That’s the strategy.
The attorney general insisted that redactions for grand-jury and other legitimate purposes would be kept to a bare minimum, that he would be as transparent as possible while still honoring the law, protecting vital defense secrets, and respecting the privacy of people who came up only peripherally in the investigation. Yet Democrats bellowed that it was Watergate! all over again, and Barr was Rosemary Woods. Advertisement Advertisement
Then we got the report. The redactions, as promised, are minimal. The basis for each is explained. In context, the black-outs are apparently sensible and unobjectionable. Yet Barr went an extra mile, making a less redacted version (with only grand-jury material excised) available to bipartisan leaders of several congressional committees.
As you’d expect, to keep up the scandal pretense, House Democrats are nevertheless pressing ahead with their subpoena for the full report . . . as America yawns.
And cover-up? While it is pretty obvious that intelligence about Russia (unrelated to Trump) was blocked out, no effort was made to scrub from the report behavior by the president that is dishonest, conniving, and — in the view of Special Counsel Mueller — on the cusp of criminal obstruction.
Remember now, the president said he would leave disclosure issues to the attorney general. The regulations call for a confidential report from the special counsel to the AG. There was no requirement that the AG publicize the report. The withholding of the report could have been justified legally under Justice Department rules against public comment on the evidence against uncharged persons, and by the classified nature of the overarching counterintelligence investigation of Russia’s interference in the election. The report, however, was released. Advertisement
Moreover, the most unsavory evidence of presidential misconduct came from the president’s own White House counsel — meaning it could have been withheld not just from Congress and the public but also from Mueller on executive-privilege and attorney–client-privilege grounds. Remember the Clinton emails investigation — recall how Mrs. Clinton inserted lawyers in her every activity, and then the Obama Justice Department dutifully tied the FBI’s hands on the rationale that basic investigative steps would have risked transgressing attorney–client privilege? By contrast, the Trump White House and Barr did not assert privilege claims; as a result, testimony damaging to the president was freely given to the prosecutor and congressional Democrats.
Finally, there is the press conference, which Democrats limned as an artifice to defraud. In reality, the Justice Department customarily calls press conferences and issues press releases at the drop of a hat. Here, there was actual need for it. The release of the report, despite the absence of charges and the lack of a legal disclosure requirement, was extraordinary. The redactions and the process of making them had to be explained. The report was so lengthy and suffused with legal esoterica that it was entirely appropriate to summarize it for the public — something the Justice Department often does for charging instruments that are less than a 20th of the size of Mueller’s magnum opus. Most important, Mueller did not resolve one of the main questions he was appointed to answer: Whether the president should be charged with obstruction. That meant Barr had to resolve it, which by itself was a good enough reason for a press conference. Advertisement Advertisement
Democrats claim Barr’s determination on obstruction was the equivalent of acting as Trump’s defense lawyer. But the only way for any prosecutor to assess the question of whether a suspect had corrupt intent is to catalogue the evidence that cuts against it — since, if corrupt intent cannot be proved beyond a reasonable doubt, there can be no criminal case. Barr did not claim that Trump had conducted himself admirably; he said that proving corrupt intent would have been difficult, if not impossible, thanks to (a) the president’s extensive cooperation with the investigation (making White House witnesses available, disclosing over a million documents, asserting no claim of privilege) and (b) the non-corrupt thinking that fueled the president’s frustration (i.e., his belief that his presidency was being destroyed by a bogus collusion allegation). That Democrats do not like this outcome does not make it wrong. Advertisement"
Carter Page: Mueller Report Shows He's Mr. Clean | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Eric Felten,04-19-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/carter-page-is-mr-clean/,"April 19, 2019 3:09 PM Carter Page in Moscow, Russia, December 12, 2016 (Sergei Karpukhin/Reuters) How many political players could survive such colonoscopic scrutiny?
H owever implausible it may seem now, there was a time when Carter Page was treated like a dangerous character. So much so that Special Counsel Robert Mueller was specifically tasked with investigating the onetime foreign-policy adviser to candidate Donald Trump.
After naming Mueller special counsel, Acting Attorney General Rod Rosenstein penned two secret memoranda detailing Mueller’s powers and focus. Rosenstein told him he “had been authorized since his appointment to investigate allegations that three Trump campaign officials — Carter Page, Paul Manafort, and George Papadopoulos — ‘committed a crime or crimes by colluding with Russian government officials with respect to the Russian government’s efforts to interfere with the 2016 presidential election.’” Page was not just tagged as an explicit target of Mueller’s probe; he was first on the list. Given what soon befell Manafort and Papadopoulos, one might have expected Page to be wearing the new black. And yet, not only is Carter Page a free man, Mueller never even managed to get him on an overdue parking ticket. The question isn’t so much what happened as what didn’t.
If anyone should have been prosecutable, it should have been Page — if he had committed any crime, that is. For starters, the FBI had Page under surveillance and all of his communications in their possession for a full year. How many political players could survive such colonoscopic scrutiny?
Add to this that Page behaved in ways that would have made it easy for any aggressive prosecutor to go after him. He allowed himself to be interviewed by the FBI repeatedly. He testified before a grand jury. He not only raised red flags, he waved them: Having been excoriated for his July 2016 trip to Moscow, where he gave a Putin-friendly speech, he went back to Moscow in December and tried to drum up some business. He appeared before Congress and made bold claims under oath. Consider his opening statement before the House Intelligence Committee in November 2017: “Whereas I have never done anything wrong in Russia, no documents, records, electronically stored information including email, communication, recordings, data and tangible things could reasonably lead to the discovery of any facts within the investigation’s publicly announced parameters as it relates to actions by the Russian government.” If Mueller had anything at all on Page, nothing would have been easier than to add a lying-to-Congress charge to the indictment.
Nor is Page the sort of evil genius who would be needed to outwit some of the DOJ’s top lawyers. Read the transcript of Page’s House testimony and you’ll be struck by the witness’s odd and awkward responses. Trying to be his own lawyer, he keeps making legalistic distinctions, such as whether his contact with someone had been a “meeting” or a “greeting.” Page makes the mistake of talking about being careful rather than actually being careful. Being a careful deponent is rather like being a pilot with the right stuff. If you talk about having the right stuff, you don’t have it; if you testify that you’re being cautious with your answers, you’re not being nearly careful enough. Advertisement
Even the Republican members quickly lost patience with Page: “You seem to draw a distinction between a meeting, a greeting, a conversation, and you hearing a speech,” said Representative Trey Gowdy. “So to the extent you may have said that you have met with senior members of Russian Government or legislators in Russia, were those meetings, greetings, conversations, or were you sitting in the audience listening?”
Gowdy was referring not only to Page’s reliance on inconsequential legalisms, but also to his unfortunate habit of self-puffery. Page would take information he heard in a speech and present it to the Trump campaign as though he had learned it in a private conversation. For example, as Mueller puts it, “In communications with Campaign officials, Page also repeatedly touted his high-level contacts in Russia and his ability to forge connections between candidate Trump and senior Russian governmental officials.” Talk up your “high-level contacts in Russia” enough and people might just start to suspect that you’re a little too tight with Russian officials. Well, that, or a certain sort of political operative might get the idea to spread suspicion about you. * * *
Page was in a bad enough position: Abandoned and shunned by Team Trump and annoying to Capitol Hill Republicans, Page was short on allies to help him contend with the Mueller squad. So what did he do? He painted a prosecutorial target on his back by refusing to accept Mueller’s enterprise as legitimate. Loudly and relentlessly he declared that the entire investigation was the outgrowth of a fraud perpetrated by Clinton operatives. Page demanded that what he calls the “dodgy dossier” itself be investigated.
That is a task the special counsel showed no interest in, though it was easily within the scope of Mueller’s mandate. Instead the special counsel did his best to prop up the FISA warrants against Page as perfectly normal and legitimate. Mueller writes, in a long footnote at the bottom of page 183, that the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court “issued warrants based on a finding of probable cause to believe that Page was an agent of a foreign power.” Mueller is unconcerned by the thin and politicized evidence used to obtain those warrants: “The FISC’s probable-cause finding was based on a different (and lower) standard than the one governing the [Special Counsel] Office’s decision whether to bring charges against Page,” Mueller writes. The Special Counsel needed “admissible evidence [that] would likely be sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Page acted as an agent of the Russian Federation during the period at issue.” To issue its surveillance warrants, according to Mueller, the FISC needed only to meet the lowest of standards — “a fair probability.” Advertisement
Thus does Mueller achieve two things at once: He maintains that the FISA warrants were handled properly, and he insinuates he could have found Page guilty, if only the standard of proof weren’t so daunting. (Someone might remind the great and powerful Mueller of Justice Edward Douglass White’s opinion in 1895’s Coffin et al. v. The United States : “The principle that there is a presumption of innocence in favor of the accused is the undoubted law, axiomatic and elementary, and its enforcement lies at the foundation of the administration of our criminal law.”) Advertisement
There’s no room for presumption of innocence when the FBI is making the accusations needed to get a FISA warrant. The first of the four FISA applications declared that “the FBI believes that the Russian Government’s efforts are being coordinated with Page and perhaps other individuals associated with Candidate #1’s [Donald Trump’s] campaign.” The second warrant to surveil Page was secured in January 2017. The judge was told that “the FBI believes that Page has been collaborating and conspiring with the Russian Government.” The third and fourth warrant applications declared “The target of this application is an agent of a foreign power.” These were big claims. The Mueller report shows, even if grudgingly, that those claims were false. * * *
Much has been made — and rightly so — about the FBI and DOJ’s lack of candor in describing dossier author Christopher Steele as a reliable source. But let’s put that aside for a moment and look at what, from the dossier, the FBI used in all four of its FISA applications. During a July 2016 trip to Moscow to give a speech, “the FBI has learned that Page met with at least two Russian officials.” Steele was the source and “reported that Page had a secret meeting with Igor Sechin, who is the President of Rosneft [a Russian energy company] and a close associate to Russian President Putin.” Page was also said to have met someone named Igor Divyekin secretly to discuss “kompromat” the Kremlin had on Hillary Clinton.
What ever happened to Igor Divyekin? He appears nowhere in Mueller’s report. You can be sure that had Page had any contact or communication with Divyekin, it would have been scooped up in the 24/7 surveillance of Page. And you can be doubly sure that any such evidence would have been front and center in a criminal-conspiracy case. Instead, Divyekin simply disappears. Sechin gets a similar treatment. In interviews on the Hill and with the FBI, Page acknowledged he spoke with an old friend who works for Sechin, but scoffed at the notion he could have met secretly with the oil tycoon. There is no proof offered by Mueller for the dossier claim that Page met secretly with Sechin. Indeed, the allegation itself doesn’t even appear in the Mueller report. Advertisement
This is particularly telling as the Sechin claim had been central to the conspiracy narrative invented by Christopher Steele and flogged all over Washington by Fusion GPS. A writer savvy about Russia, Julia Ioffe, started working on an article about Page for Politico in the summer before the presidential election. She was inclined to sneer at the amateurism of the Trump team, and her working theory was that Page was a nobody trying to climb the greasy pole by inflating his credentials. But soon she was presented with an alternative take: “As I started looking into Page, I began getting calls from two separate ‘corporate investigators’ digging into what they claim are all kinds of shady connections Page has to all kinds of shady Russians,” she wrote. “Both claimed to me that the FBI was investigating Page for allegedly meeting with Igor Sechin.”
Ioffe didn’t buy it. She knew enough about Russia not to be taken in by the fanciful stories Fusion GPS was peddling. “Was Page the shadowy messenger between the Kremlin and Trump Tower,” Ioffe asked, “or was he the nebbishy, not-very-successful man trying to profit” from being on a list of Trump advisers? She concluded that “whatever game the Russians were running, Page was firmly in the latter camp.”
Had the FBI been less credulous, maybe a smidgen more sophisticated, or perhaps just less eager to hobble Trump, they might have easily come to the same conclusion. It would have saved everyone a lot of bother."

Poway Unified School District , a divided panel of the Ninth Circuit rules that the First Amendment permits schools to impose viewpoint-discriminatory restrictions on student speech. The case arose when Tyler Harper wore an anti-homosexuality T-shirt to his high school in response to the school’s sponsorship of a gay-rights event. The school ordered Harper not to wear the T-shirt. Judge Stephen Reinhardt’s majority opinion rules that schools may bar “derogatory and injurious remarks directed at students’ minority status such as race, religion, and sexual orientation.” As Judge Alex Kozinski argues in his dissent, the school district “may have been justified in banning the subject [of homosexuality] altogether by denying both sides permission to express their views during the school day.” But having permitted the pro-gay speech, the school can’t be allowed to gag other viewpoints.
Harper’s complaint will be rendered moot when he graduates from high school. In March 2007, the Supreme Court will grant Harper’s petition for certiorari and vacate (i.e., wipe from existence) the Ninth Circuit’s ruling.

Editor’s Note: This article was first published in the April 24, 1987, issue of National Review . * * *
And he said unto them, Behold, when ye are entered into the city, there shall a man meet you, bearing a pitcher of water; follow him into the house where he entereth in.
And ye shall say unto the goodman of the house, The Master saith unto thee, Where is the guestchamber, where I shall eat the passover with my disciples? And he shall show you a large upper room furnished: there make ready. Advertisement Advertisement
—Luke 22: 10–12
T here is a strange agency at work here. The Scripture might be haunted. That pitcher-bearer. This goodman. They spook me. Who are they, what special order of grace do they belong to? And, elsewhere, those men who surrender the colt “whereon yet never man sat.” Nameless, equivocal shapes. “Hey,” they shout, “why loose ye the colt?” The Lord has need of it, His disciples explain. Oh, well. In that case. Why didn’t you say so? Take our expensive animal. And has their free will been taken also? It is as if a casual, weird cast of accomplices inhabited Jerusalem. Men or suchlike who know, often better than fumbling Peter or over-literal Thomas, just how to ornament the Passion.
Were they perhaps made of some angelic stuff? I don’t think so: it is the Lord’s habit, thank God, to enlist men wherever convenient. He has an economical disposition. And Man was, after all, what this grand enterprise had been about from the first. But how then did Jesus, so to speak, make His room reservation in advance? Were these men sensitized by dreams? Did the Holy Spirit, foraging like a quartermaster sergeant, requisition their possessions through sign and vision? It is possible. The Lord had been known to trouble sleep. “And being warned of God in a dream . . . ” Was there fitfulness before the Passover? Advertisement Advertisement
Again, I think not. God prefers, when He can, to conserve terrestrial order. He has a dramatic instinct. And His own peculiar unities. The Passion is as naturalistic as frail wrist tissue shredded by a spike. Jesus could ferment water. He could infinitely divide the loaf and the fish. But here He had need of a furnished apartment. His colt might have come about providentially, as Abraham’s ram came about, caught in some thicket. But God wanted a known colt: one that had memorable references in Jerusalem. It was His purpose to leave a clear and historical track behind — evidence that might stand up in court. The presence of transcendent power among modest instruments is more persuasive than any bullying miracle could be.
I suppose it this way, then. That these — pitcher-bearer and goodman and colt-owner, these first acolytes of the Eucharist — were men given sudden and heightened perception. An abrupt seeing Into. Spirit came upon them as Jesus came upon Matthew sitting at the receipt of custom: “Follow me. And he arose, and followed Him.” Simply that. Next Window Please . We are so habituated to reason and a precious carefulness that Christ’s people seem, well, irresponsible. But grace is first the law-breaker. It can be brutal: “Let the dead bury their dead.” Brutal and rash and unfair. Because there is no ground whatever for believing that these were righteous men. They didn’t earn their cameo roles in the Passion through good work. I suspect they were chosen rather for an openness to potential. They were, above all, ready men. Advertisement
Simon of Cyrene, recruited by grace and some Roman to lug Jesus’ cross, is my paradigm in this. He had, it would seem, no previous experience for the work. No moral credentials that we hear about. Just a man “who passed by, coming out of the country.” To trade, to sightsee, to window-shop: another tourist in the Big Fig. And, all at once, he is absorbed by that rubbernecking mob. Elbow to the front — what have we here? And it’s you, yes you. Bozo, pack that wood. We know nothing about Simon, except that his children, Rufus and Alexander, became Christians. On Good Friday, Simon was what we all are, a passerby. And shanghaied by the Holy Spirit. I take comfort in this thought, whose life otherwise does not much recommend itself to God. That I may be granted, through His fierce randomness and my mere availability, a walk-on moment of redemption. Advertisement
Return to the Passion now. Imagine, say, a man in his workshop room alone. For best effect, I’d fancy him preoccupied: revising some device of his craft, in thought, whatever. Suppose it hot and ordinary out. Then, all of one rush, as weather can change, there should be an importance in the air. Let that cheap pitcher interpose itself across his attention here. For this instant it should have more pitcherness . The way common objects astound and please when we are full of joy. This is, you know, not his regular time to fetch water in. But the thought of “pitcher,” the very surprising idea that it can hold water , contains aptness and fascination for him. It has been infused by grace. And he rises at a call — not from God as such, nor from any impending event — but to honor the perfect nature of one created thing. There is elevation all around. Advertisement"
Easter Sunday: They Fled from the Tomb | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Kevin D. Williamson,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/they-fled-from-the-tomb/," People gather at Notre Dame Cathedral two days after the fire in Paris, France, April 17, 2019. (Benoit Tessier/Reuters) The church will be rebuilt. It is always being rebuilt.
‘E verything burns.” The Joker heard it from Heraclitus.
There are worse things that can happen to a church — to a church building ; the building is not the church — than a fire. Notre-Dame de Paris will be repaired, and the French will do a splendid job of it. They are still the people who built that colossal statue that stands in New York Harbor, which combined the heroic aesthetic of Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi with the engineering genius of Gustave Eiffel. As a wise friend wrote after the fire: The French are proud, and they have a great deal to be proud of — just give them time.
Other church structures will not be as lucky as Notre Dame. With buildings as with people, it is happier and more easeful to be rich, beautiful, and famous. Many other churches — in Paris, in Maastricht, in Rome — have become what Notre Dame almost ( almost ) became: tourist attractions, and nothing else. Or museums or bookstores or cafés. A spire can be rebuilt, pews replaced, a roof restored. But when a church in San Francisco is converted into a $7.5 million, three-bedroom private residence, what resurrection then is possible? The advertising copy is the gospel of our time: “The lower level can serve as an art gallery, a recording studio, a gym, or a wine cellar.”
From the chalice of benediction to cabernet sauvignon — from one wine cult to another. Like Walter Donovan, we have chosen poorly. Advertisement
Our new viticultural faith is a good deal less demanding than the old one. Give it that. Do you remember the movie poster for Chocolat ? (IMDB, 2000: “A woman and her daughter open a chocolate shop in a small French village that shakes up the rigid morality of the community,” the rigid morality of the French being the great theme of European civilization in our time.) Juliette Binoche offers Johnny Depp a mock Eucharist, feeding him a piece of candy (decorated with a pagan fertility symbol) against the background of a quaint little church. “Sinfully delicious,” the advertising copy reads. For turn-of-the-century filmgoers entirely lacking subtlety, the film is set during Lent. Translate “ Laissez les bons temps rouler! ” into Latin and carve it on the lintels. Advertisement
Ours is a comfortable little world, snug and well-fed and risk-averse.
Why bother to repair Notre Dame? Because it is a very beautiful building? Because it is part of our “Judeo-Christian heritage,” whatever it is we mean by that? To flip Mohammed & Co. the bird? “ Oh, dear, well, we’re all French Catholics today. Have some baguette .” Advertisement
Why run into a burning building, as Father Jean-Marc Fournier of the Paris Fire Brigade did, to rescue the consecrated host? Cultural symbolism? “If it’s a symbol, to hell with it,” as Flannery O’Connor famously put it. Advertisement
And what if it’s not?
“Trembling and bewildered, the women went out and fled from the tomb. They said nothing to anyone, because they were afraid.”
“ Oh, you must find your faith very comforting .” They were not comforted. They were afraid, too terrified to speak. It begins with fear. Everything begins with fear.
“He is not here,” the angel said. Of course they were trembling and bewildered. Everything they had known, had thought they knew, was wrong. It was false, possibly a lie and, at the very least, an enormous misunderstanding. The world suddenly became as mysterious to them as if they were strangers in it — which, they must have begun to understand, is exactly what they were, and what we are. The execution they had witnessed was not the death of a criminal or a heretic, or even a mere man: A man, yes, but not only that, because there was more to man than they had known or thought possible. They were not what they thought they were, because He was not what they assumed He was, because the tomb was — is — empty, because He Is Not Here.
As Father Richard John Neuhaus put it in his Good Friday meditation, Death on a Friday Afternoon , “If what Christians say about Good Friday is true, then it is, quite simply, the truth about everything.” Between the blood and misery of Good Friday and the trembling and bewilderment of the Resurrection lies a silence longer than its hours. In those hours, we are alone. And then the discovery: Heraclitus had it all wrong. As Father Gerard Manly Hopkins puts it directly in his sonnet of joyful rejoinder, “That Nature Is a Heraclitean Fire and of the Comfort of the Resurrection”:
I am all at once what Christ is,
since he was what I am, and
This Jack, joke, poor potsherd,
patch, matchwood, immortal diamond,
Is immortal diamond.
When the fire reached the altar at Notre Dame, the tabernacle was empty, because the chaplain of the fire brigade had seen to it that it was so: He is not here. It is not the case that everything burns. Buildings burn, and sometimes they are repurposed — bookstores, museums, San Francisco mansions. He is not here — not here : not confined in this burning building, not contained in this home gym and wine cellar on the lower level, not on display in this museum, not decaying in this tomb.
Yes, the church will be rebuilt. It is always being rebuilt, as T. S. Eliot knew:
The Church must be forever building, for it is forever decaying within and attacked from without;
For this is the law of life; and you must remember that while there is time of prosperity"
Supreme Court Considers Citizenship Question on Census | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,George Will,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/census-citizenship-question-supreme-court-case/," U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross testifies on Capitol Hill, June 20, 2018. (Kevin Lamarque/Reuters) This is another case in which Trump administration behavior is provoking plaintiffs to ask the judiciary to police the blurry boundaries of executive discretion.
Washington — The oral arguments the Supreme Court will hear on Tuesday will be more decorous than the gusts of judicial testiness that blew the case up to the nation’s highest tribunal. The case, which raises arcane questions of administrative law but could have widely radiating political and policy consequences, comes from the Enlightenment mentality of the nation’s Founders, and involves this question: Does it matter that a conspicuously unenlightened member of the president’s cabinet lied in sworn testimony about why he made a decision that he arguably has the statutory power to make?
Because America’s 18th-century Founders were rational, empirical, inquisitive pursuers of evidence-based improvement, they placed in the Constitution’s second section after the preamble a requirement for a census. And the 14th Amendment stipulates the required actual enumeration, every ten years, of “the whole number” of persons residing in the country. From 1820 (when Congress wanted “foreigners not naturalized” to be counted) through 1950, the census almost always included a citizenship question, and in 2018, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross decided that the 2020 “short-form” questionnaire, the one that goes to every household, should include one. Ross has testified that he was “responding solely” to a Justice Department request for the question to provide data helpful to enforcement of the Voting Rights Act (VRA) of 1965.
A federal district judge called this Ross rationale “pretextual” because Ross was justifying a decision “already made for other reasons.” This was a polite but still stinging way of saying Ross lied, which he almost certainly did: Justice officials initially rejected Commerce’s request that it ask for a citizenship question, and said such data was unnecessary for VRA enforcement. The district judge said Commerce sought the Justice letter to “launder” the request for the citizenship question “through another agency,” this being just one of “a veritable smorgasbord” of rules violations by Ross and his aides. Advertisement
Ross also testified that he was “not aware” of any discussions of the citizenship questions between Commerce and the White House. But after 18 states, 15 municipalities, and various immigration advocacy groups sued, he acknowledged meeting early in 2017 with then–presidential adviser Stephen Bannon, an anti-immigration zealot. The district judge also said Ross “materially mischaracterized” — translation: lied about — a conversation with a polling expert in order to obfuscate the expert’s objections to the citizenship question.
Because more information is preferable to less, the citizenship question might seem sensible. However, the question might result in less information because the Census Bureau’s own experts believe that the citizenship question would cause 6.5 million people — almost one in ten households includes one or more noncitizens — to not respond to the questionnaire for fear of law-enforcement consequences. The 6.5 million are approximately as many people as live in Indiana. Of the estimated 24 million noncitizens (about 7 percent of America’s population of almost 329 million), almost eleven million are here illegally.
The citizenship question is, the Trump administration insists, “a wholly unremarkable demographic question.” But why, then, was Ross so dishonest concerning its genesis? This is probably why: A substantial undercount would affect the formulas by which hundreds of billions of dollars of federal spending are dispersed, to the disadvantage of blue states and cities with large immigrant populations. Furthermore, because the 14th Amendment stipulates that seats in the House of Representatives shall be apportioned on the basis of “the whole number of persons in each state” regardless of citizenship, an undercount could cost some states, particularly blue states, congressional seats, and hence electoral votes.
The district-court judge was scalding about the “egregious” behavior of Ross, who “in a startling number of ways” either “ignored, cherry-picked, or badly misconstrued” evidence and “acted irrationally . . . in light of that evidence.” Yet the judge professed himself “unable to determine — based on the existing record, at least — what Secretary Ross’s real reasons for adding the citizenship question were.” Perhaps the judge was precluded from coming to a conclusion about Ross’s motives; the public is not.

Notre Dame Cathedral Will Rise Again | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,J.C. Comeau,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/notre-dame-cathedral-will-rise-again/," A crane works at Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris, France, April 19, 2019. (Philippe Wojazer/Pool via Reuters) April 15th will not be the final chapter in Notre Dame’s long and storied history. Out of the ashes, we have hope that she will rise again.
I t was not long after the spire of Notre Dame collapsed when I found myself in the basement rummaging through my grandfather’s old books. I was looking for Victor Hugo’s ode to the great cathedral. And although I was unable to find it, I remain convinced that there must be a copy stowed away somewhere among the dusty shelves. I’ll look again tomorrow, or perhaps I’ll make my way downtown to see if the library has a copy of its own in circulation. After the events of this week, I imagine I will not be the only one wandering the stacks, searching for that famous novel.
I had hoped to find The Hunchback of Notre Dame so that I might, if only for a moment, be granted a vision of the place that has been lost. Yet however beautiful Hugo’s prose might be, I also knew that words would never be able to do her justice. Words may paint a picture in the mind’s eye, they may even inspire us to wondrous acts of restoration (as Hugo’s novel did), but they cannot compete with the poetry of woodwork and stone that was Notre Dame. So much of this poetry was lost on Monday. That is why we weep.
A cathedral as great as Notre Dame is more than a backdrop for the City of Lights. In many ways, it managed to integrate itself into the heart and soul of its people. So too did the people leave a part of themselves with it. The story it shares with us is passed down from generation to generation, each making its own contribution to her construction, upkeep, and restoration. It is one told through the work of the hands, a story hewn from stone and carved in wood. That is what made her remarkable. Where many of us struggle to express ourselves in words, the makers of Notre Dame managed to express the fluid notions of the mind in a medium as solid and unforgiving as stone. Advertisement
At Notre Dame, we were confronted by that which we may have otherwise believed to be ineffable. In walking among the pews, in gazing up at the cross above the altar, we were given the chance to encounter expressions of beauty, wonder, majesty, and solace that could be found nowhere else. Here was a poetry we could reach out and touch. Here the thoughts and images that flow through our minds were given form. For the doubting Thomases among us, Notre Dame extended a hand, she helped us to know that these things were real. In such a way the cathedral served to remind us that the Christian faith is not placed in some ethereal being, but in God Incarnate. Notre Dame served to reinforce the fact that God, in all His splendor, dwelt among us. This particular house of God stood as a testament to His beauty, majesty, and awe-inspiring presence, just as the lowly manger once stood as a testament to his humility and compassion.
But with the loss of Notre Dame, even if it be but a partial loss, there comes a fear that this beauty has gone out of the world forever. In an age in which what is economical seems to take precedence, we often struggle to justify the cost of the beautiful and the true. It becomes easy to forget that man does not live on bread alone. Notre Dame, while she stood, helped to remind us of that teaching. Through her many virtues the cathedral sought to edify the whole of man. In so doing she was a much-needed light in our time of trouble. Advertisement"
Remembering Father James V. Schall: An Old-School Jesuit | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,George Weigel,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/remembering-father-james-schall/,"April 21, 2019 6:30 AM Father James Schall in 2012 The faith of the longtime Georgetown professor informed his intellectual work, as his intellect refined his faith.
T he most distinguished son of Pocahontas, Iowa, Father James V. Schall, S.J., died at age 91 on April 17, just as Lent 2019 was drawing to a close and Easter was visible on the horizon.
Father Schall was what’s usually referred to as an “old-school Jesuit” — meaning (to my mind) that he was the kind of Jesuit St. Ignatius Loyola imagined when he founded the Society of Jesus in the 16th century. Jim Schall was both a man of rock-solid Catholic faith and a first-rate intellectual, a distinguished political philosopher at home with political theory from Plato through the moderns. His faith informed his intellectual work, as his intellect refined his faith. He was an exceptionally gifted teacher; before he was put out to pasture by Jesuit superiors who didn’t seem to grasp what a magnet he was for the students they ought to be recruiting, his last lecture at Georgetown University was attended by hundreds, who spilled out of venerable Gaston Hall into the surrounding corridors. He was a devoted priest, a masterful spiritual director, and a counselor who encouraged his students to think vocationally, whether about the priesthood or consecrated religious life, marriage, or their professional careers.
He was also an ascetic, whom self-denial, religious disciplines, and — in his last decade, illness — had whittled down, so that in his eighties he looked something like a lean, mean pirate in a Roman collar (which he always wore). But there was no meanness in the man, only a sweetness of temperament wed to a bracing, unblinking honesty about the state of the Church, the world, and the Society to which he had given his life. His suffering from cancer and his being blinded in one eye did make his legion of friends and protégés wonder about God’s ways with his most devoted servants; Father Schall would have said that suffering is good for you, because if you conform your sufferings to those of Christ in his Passion, then God’s grace helps you grow through suffering into the imitation of Christ that every Christian should be. Advertisement
Father Schall’s life and holy death invite a reflection on the gamble that the Catholic Church took in approving Saint Ignatius’s proposal, during the cultural tsunami of the Reformation, to create an elite corps of priestly guerrillas, formed by his Spiritual Exercises , whom Ignatius would deploy to “set the world ablaze” (as the inscription on the base of his statue at the Jesuit GHQ in Rome reminds us). As my friend Russell Hittinger once put it, the Exercises were a spirituality invented for European intellectuals paddling canoes up rivers in the middle of nowhere, surrounded by what were then known as “savages.” The Exercises were thus very much a me-and-God affair; the gamble was that they would not lead to a radical, delusory subjectivism, because a well-formed Jesuit would also be unshakeable in his commitment to the truth of Catholic faith and to the teaching authority of the Church. Cut that tether to truth and ecclesiastical authority, and trouble would begin.
And then there was that quite deliberate Ignatian elitism. Self-defined and self-constructed elites are almost always trouble within a complex institution. They risk becoming what C. S. Lewis called an “Inner Ring,” which imagines itself composed of superior types to whom others must defer, and who are, because of their superiority, absolved from some of the myriad loyalties that bind others to the institution. The Jesuits’ stern, unbending fidelity – embodied in their famous fourth vow and its promise of radical obedience to the pope and radical availability for any mission the pope decreed – would, it was hoped, prevent this elite corps from decomposing into something akin to its own church, marching to the beat of its own, self-consciously superior drummers.
The Church’s gamble paid off in the life of men such as Father Jim Schall, for whom radical commitment to the full symphony of Catholic truth was liberating rather than confining — especially when that commitment was intellectually refined by a lifelong immersion in the great books of Western civilization. Whether that gamble has paid off in respect of the entire Society of Jesus as the Catholic Church experiences it today is a question that caused Father Schall more than a little anxiety over the course of his long life."

1969 —In his majority opinion in Shapiro v. Thompson , Justice Brennan rules that state and D.C. laws that deny welfare assistance to residents of less than a year violate a constitutional right to travel interstate. Brennan’s usual ally, Chief Justice Warren, dissents on the ground that Congress had authorized the one-year residency requirement. In a separate dissent, Justice Harlan objects that he “know[s] of nothing which entitles this Court to pick out particular human activities, characterize them as ‘fundamental,’ and give them added protection under an unusually stringent equal protection test.” More broadly, Harlan observes:
“Today’s decision, it seems to me, reflects to an unusual degree the current notion that this Court possesses a peculiar wisdom all its own whose capacity to lead this Nation out of its present troubles is contained only by the limits of judicial ingenuity in contriving new constitutional principles to meet each problem as it arises.” Ed Whelan is the President of the Ethics and Public Policy Center. @EdWhelan123 "
Mueller Report: Trump and the Firing of James Comey | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Ramesh Ponnuru,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/mueller-report-trump-aides-james-comey-firing/,"April 21, 2019 10:01 PM President Trump speaks during a meeting of the White House Opportunity and Revitalization Council, April 4, 2019.

Many, many people have observed that the Mueller report offers example after example of Trump’s aides saving him from bad decisions by ignoring them. It’s an accurate generalization, and I’ve made it myself . But it seems to me that the report also offers details about one big exception to this rule.
The report suggests that Trump wanted to fire James Comey because he kept refusing to say in public what he was telling Trump in private: that Trump wasn’t the subject of an investigation. (See, e.g., Volume II, p. 75, of the Mueller report.) Trump wanted to say so, but multiple underlings including White House counsel Don McGahn and Chief of Staff Reince Priebus repeatedly objected (see Volume II, pp. 65-9 of the Mueller report for details).
Instead the official story was that Trump had fired Comey on Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein’s recommendation, and that recommendation was based on Comey’s handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton, including his unfairness to her. That story was false: Trump wanted Comey gone before, and for different reasons than those mentioned in, Rosenstein’s memo. The president quickly contradicted it."

(Athit Perawongmetha/Reuters)
Sri Lankan authorities believe a local Islamist militant group, assisted by an “international network” of sympathizers, carried out the string of church and hotel bombings that left 290 people dead and at least 500 injured on Sunday morning.
While they have not yet announced the responsible party, the authorities believe members of a local group known as National Thowheed Jamath carried out a total of eight bombings across the country on Sunday.
All of the suicide bombers were Sri Lankan citizens, but they were assisted by foreign sympathizers, officials announced Monday.
“We do not believe these attacks were carried out by a group of people who were confined to this country,” cabinet spokesman Rajitha Senaratne said. “There was an international network without which these attacks could not have succeeded.”
Suicide bombers detonated improvised explosive devices filled with small metal projectiles inside of three Catholic churches during Easter services. They also detonated bombs in three hotels in the nation’s capital, Colombo. Two additional explosions occurred during police raids on addresses in the capital.
Twenty-four people have been arrested in connection with the attacks and 87 detonator devices have been recovered from a local bus stop. Stay Updated with NR Daily

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Sunday that several Americans were killed in the bombings.
“Attacks on innocent people gathering in a place of worship or enjoying a holiday meal are affronts to the universal values and freedoms that we hold dear, and demonstrate yet again the brutal nature of radical terrorists whose sole aim is to threaten peace and security,” Pompeo said.
“We can confirm that several U.S. citizens were among those killed,” he added. “The U.S. Embassy is working tirelessly to provide all possible assistance to the American citizens affected by the attacks and their families.”"
Notre Dame and Saint Patrick’s: Cathedrals That Are Our Lives | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Kathryn Jean Lopez,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/notre-dame-saint-patricks-cathedrals/,"April 22, 2019 6:30 AM People outside Notre Dame Cathedral two days after the fire in Paris, France, April 17, 2019. (Benoit Tessier/Reuters) A fire burns in more than the beloved cathedral.
T he Wi-Fi on my flight from Rome to Newark wasn’t working, so phones were buzzing about Notre Dame in France as soon as we hit the runway. After the initial shock and sadness, gratitude was expressed. There are upsides to being disconnected: At least we didn’t have to watch, on live television, something we couldn’t control. That seemed to be an instant lesson, before we knew much of anything, including the cause or the damage. Advertisement Advertisement
I’ve never been to Paris, so I’ve never been to the cathedral there. But on Monday I did the closest I could after I cleared customs: I went to the cathedral in Newark, N.J. The Cathedral of the Sacred Heart is, as it happens, an under-appreciated treasure. It’s safe to say that most people do not travel to New York City only to hop on the train to Newark to pray. More should. As it happens, the Mass schedule was changed up for Holy Week, so my visit was short that day. But had I stayed on, I might have run into the man who would be arrested later that week in my home cathedral of Saint Patrick’s on Fifth Avenue. On Monday, he had been removed by police at Sacred Heart Cathedral, for refusing to leave. On Wednesday, he was caught trying to set fire to “America’s Parish Church” over the Hudson.
I mention all this not only because it hits a little close to home but because the reactions people have had to Notre Dame in flames is a sign of hope in the world, isn’t it? We live at a time when so many of us seem to be living lives as partial spectators, upset about things we can have no control over, letting our moods and even health be affected for the worse by politics, primarily. Not only is there more to life than the Mueller report. There’s even more to life than people’s takes on it. Advertisement
I got into Saint Peter’s Basilica only once on this trip to Rome. Security has been stepped up in recent years, and my old ways of going in as often as I can have become a thing of the past, given the line to get in. I was immersed in prayer and thanksgiving this time and didn’t really have the thought I did on a previous visit: This could be my last time here. Rewind a bit and the so-called Islamic State was openly calling for attacks on the pope and the Vatican and I had very much considered the possibility. When a priest friend from the U.S. was called to assignment there, the terrorist-attack concern was one of my first thoughts, which became prayers for protection. But I do think about it now and again at Saint Patrick’s, as a counterterrorism police officer seems to be patrolling by the confessional as I wait in line. I sometimes think: This is not a normal church experience.
But then it is, isn’t it, living in these times? It seemed all the more part of the fabric of our lives when on Tuesday, about 24 hours before the gas-can incident that would lead to the scare and the arrest at Saint Patrick’s, I watched a counterterrorism cop holding one of his children by the hand, showing his family one of the side chapels during his break. Churches are full of stories. People who gave from their earnings to help pay for them, the skill by which others created a gift to God, and to man, to help us reach Heaven. They continue to be full of stories, even Notre Dame. People can’t seem to get enough of the story of the fire chaplain who, in the days after the fire, was talking about the the Blessed Sacrament, the Eucharist, which Catholics believes is the Real Presence of Christ. It seemed to me a miracle of God that during Holy Week — which would become Mueller Report Week by mid Wednesday — so many on both sides of the Atlantic were talking about “Our Lady” and were transfixed by a church.

The questions remain not about whether or how France will rebuild, because money is clearly being raised, and I assume the pressure will be high to not mess with something so seemingly close to perfection. What I wonder — and pray about — is whether this shared experience that people had of watching the burning of Notre Dame will keep us from the false security and complacency that can be our lives.

It is striking to me that at the churches in Rome you always run into someone looking for money. This happens in urban areas, especially in the U.S., but in Rome the churches, sad to say, are tourist attractions even more than they are places of worship these days. That person sitting outside is not a nuisance. It’s easier here, where we probably speak the same language, but you’d be surprised how far you can get with hand gestures and a little bad Italian and how many people know just a little English. We can build great cathedrals with the way we live our lives, by how we love. Next time you are in a church with even an inch of beauty — maybe it can be today — don’t miss the opportunity to remember that this could be your last chance to begin really to live by the measure of love, reaching, with virtue, high above the mud and muck and news frenzies. So many people seemed to have their selfies to show from Notre Dame, but what about the stories of conversion? Advertisement"
Trump Administration Tightens Sanctions ‘To Bring Iran's Oil Exports to Zero’ | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Jack Crowe,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/news/trump-administration-tightens-sanctions-to-bring-irans-oil-exports-to-zero/,"April 22, 2019 9:50 AM An Iranian flag flies at the Sorough oil field in 2005. (Raheb Homavandi/Reuters)
The Trump administration has stepped up efforts to completely eliminate Iran’s oil export market, announcing Monday the elimination of sanctions exemptions that allowed the rogue nation to continue exporting oil to a select group of nations.
The Trump administration last year granted six-month waivers to eight countries, exempting them from the wide-ranging sanctions implemented as part of the unilateral U.S. withdrawal from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal. The elimination of those exemptions, which Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will officially announce Monday afternoon, will likely devastate the already struggling Iranian economy.
“President Donald J. Trump has decided not to reissue Significant Reduction Exceptions (SREs) when they expire in early May,” the White House said in a statement. “This decision is intended to bring Iran’s oil exports to zero, denying the regime its principal source of revenue.”
Crude futures spiked to six-month highs on news of the move, which is expected to eliminate 1 million barrels per day from the global market beginning May 2. Stay Updated with NR Daily

In response, Iranian officials have threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz, a narrow waterway through which one fifth of the world’s traded oil supply travels.
“If we are prevented from using it, we will close it,”Alireza Tangsiri, head of the Revolutionary Guard Corps navy force, told the state-run Fars news agency. “In the event of any threats, we will not have the slightest hesitation to protect and defend Iran’s waterway.”"
Impeach Donald Trump? Democrats are In for a Wild Ride if They Try | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Jim Geraghty,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/the-morning-jolt/democrats-if-you-try-to-impeach-trump-dont-say-you-werent-warned/,"Follow Jim Geraghty on Twitter April 22, 2019 9:36 AM President Donald Trump attends the National African American History Month Reception at the White House in Washington, D.C., February 21, 2019. (Jim Young/REUTERS) Hey, did anything big happen last week while I was on vacation? Thanks to Alexandra DeSanctis for filling in last week. I received several messages about how great her writing was in my absence, so thinking of Wally Pipp . . . Alexandra, knock it off. Stop being so good at this. Go Ahead, Democrats. Try to Impeach the President. Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report paints a picture of a president who wanted to obstruct justice through acts such as firing Mueller and shutting down the investigation, but never quite managed to obstruct anything. “The President’s efforts to influence the investigation were mostly unsuccessful, but that is largely because the persons who surrounded the President declined to carry out orders or accede to his requests.” The strongest evidence that Trump never successfully obstructed justice is that Mueller completed his report with no interruptions, impediments, denied resources, or other hindrance from the White House. We’ve never removed a president from office, and an intent to obstruct with no actual obstruction is a thin reed for the first removal of a sitting president of the United States. But many Democrats no doubt believe the behavior and actions described in the Mueller report deserve impeachment. Some Republicans may agree that a president who tries to obstruct justice ought to be impeached, even if he doesn’t succeed. So go for it, Congressional Democrats. Yes, the most likely outcome is two mostly party-line votes in the House and Senate. It would eat up six months or so of the nation’s time and, I suspect, increase the odds of President Trump’s reelection. If it started soon, it would probably conclude at the end of 2019 and then the country would begin the 2020 presidential campaign in earnest with the first primaries. The country would probably be exhausted from the arguments, and probably grow increasingly irritated with a Democratic party that has denied Trump’s legitimacy as president from day one. Some Congressional Democratic leaders will argue that this is a matter better resolved to the 2020 election. Impeachment is an inherently political process, and perhaps it is simpler and easier to just leave this to the voters. But a presidential election is not a trial; the opposing party’s nominee is not a prosecutor and the electorate is not a jury. Our Constitution includes a mechanism for resolving allegations of presidential lawbreaking, and that’s impeachment. Imagine that everything in the Starr report about Bill Clinton’s actions had come out in his first term. Would Republicans in April 1995 have said, “We’ll let the voters decide the appropriate consequence for perjury and suborning perjury in November 1996?” I doubt it. The attitude of Republicans then was that presidential lawbreaking demanded consequence, whether enforcing that consequence is popular or not. Democrats are free to embrace that philosophy today. If Democrats do not pursue impeachment, we will be hearing “Trump could have and should have been impeached over what’s in the Mueller report” for the next 18 months or five-and-a-half years. If you think there’s grounds for impeachment, then do it. If you don’t, then drop the claim. Keep in mind, there’s no statute of limitations on any of this. If Democrats choose to not impeach Trump this year, they can keep it in their back pocket and, at any time during his presidency if he’s elected to a second term, take it up later. It’s unlikely that we’ll ever see 67 Democrats in the Senate, but this represents a stink-bomb that the Democrats can throw at the president at any time, as long as they hold a majority in the House. Politically, impeachment would probably be a disaster for Democrats. All of those newly elected House Democrats, who pledged to work in a bipartisan fashion to focus on the country’s real problems, will have accomplished nothing in their first term. They would face the choice of voting for impeachment and fueling the motivation of the Republicans in their purple districts or voting against impeachment and enraging the progressives in their districts. But the Democratic base needs to experience a hard lesson that a president is not illegitimate because they feel like he ought to be. Many Democrats have convinced themselves that the public will support them. But in electorate that is often displeased with Trump’s behavior, rhetoric and antics does not want him removed from office . On Saturday, the Washington Post reported , “Democratic leaders have been in touch with lawmakers hosting town halls throughout the two-week congressional recess, and voters are rarely expressing a desire to impeach the president, according to one leadership official.” But parties are free to exercise their power in a counterproductive and self-destructive manner. An unsuccessful effort to impeach Trump may be the only way the Democratic party finally comes to terms with the results of the 2016 election. Go ahead, Democrats. Just don’t say no one warned you. An Uncharitable Assessment of the 2020 Democratic Field’s Giving In the first “ Twenty Things ” piece about Bernie Sanders , I noted that shortly after being elected mayor of Burlington, Sanders was invited to give remarks at an event kicking off a United Way fundraising drive, and shocked attendees by declaring, “ I don’t believe in charities .” Sanders went on to argue that government, rather than charity organizations, should take over responsibility for social programs. That is a terrible ethos, but it is a consistent one. If you believe that it is the duty of the government to help the poor, the sick, the disabled, those going through hard times, and that only the government should handle those duties, then you see private charities as competitors and impediments to your vision of society. Consciously or not, you’re rooting against those charities; you would prefer to see the United Way and Habitat for Humanity, the Salvation Army and everything else wither away and go out of business — so that everyone would become dependent upon government for that needed aid. The more those charities thrive and help solve society’s problems, the less people will see a need for the government to step in. This philosophy is morally hideous, of course; most of us would conclude that we should help out how we can and where we can. Most of us also believe there’s room for both government efforts and private charities. The problems are big enough to require the best of both. There is a long and pretty bipartisan tradition of wealthy presidential candidates revealing, via their tax returns, that they make only small charitable donations — at least the ones itemized and listed on their tax returns. Jonah points out that because most aspiring presidents know they will be asked to release their tax returns, and that the amount of charitable contributions is usually the biggest news story to come out of those documents, it’s bewildering that the likes of Sanders and Beto O’Rourke wouldn’t contribute more. O’Rourke offered the lamest explanation last week : “I’ve served in public office since 2005. I do my best to contribute to the success of my community, my state and now, of my country. There are ways that I do this that are measurable. And there are ways that I do this that are immeasurable.” This is the sort of statement that ought to be greeted by audible boos from anyone within earshot. Elected officials love to describe their work as “public service” or describe themselves as “public servant,” but how many servants get all the perks that House members do? That’s $174,000 per year, workplace gym, a $40,000 budget to furnish home state offices, a subsidy covering roughly 70 percent of their health insurance costs, a pension and a separate 401(k), a staff allowance of nearly one million dollars; a separate $250,000 for mail to constituents, and taxpayer-covered travel costs between their district and Washington? O’Rourke and his wife reported $366,455 adjusted gross income in 2017; “they paid $81,019 in federal income tax that year and donated $1,166 to charity — a giving rate of just 0.3%, which is well below the national average.” The O’Rourkes gave 4.3 percent of their income in 2013, but most years from 2008 to 2017 gave .2 percent to .9 percent, on joint income ranging from What Will the Mood Be at This Year’s NRA Convention? Later this week, I’ll be covering the National Rifle Association’s Annual Meeting in Indianapolis. There are years the event is mostly rah-rah triumphalism about victories in the fight to preserve and defend the Second Amendment, and years where there’s a mood of rushing to the ramparts . (There are also plenty of attendees who are interested in the firearms on display and not all that interested in what’s going on in the political realm.) At the 2017 convention , attendees could cheer presidential and vice-presidential addresses and largely pro-gun majorities in the House and Senate, as well as the confirmation of Justice Neil Gorsuch. This year’s annual meeting will be the first meeting since Democrats took over the House, after a midterm-election period where the NRA was less active than usual, and the NRA’s board finds itself in the odd position of suing its major advertising agency over access to documents . Like many political organizations, one of the biggest impediments can be success: If you win some high-profile fights, your members feel like the job is done and they can turn their attention and energy to other endeavors. Complacency is almost inevitable; no organization or movement can operate at 100 percent enthusiasm all the time. But that complacency almost inevitably generates defeats, which generates a sudden fear that ground is being lost. The alarm is sounded, those who tuned out tune back in. The question is, does 2020 have the NRA’s membership stirred again? Or does the next presidential election or Supreme Court nominee fight seem too far off?

The Tax Reform Did Not Discriminate against Blue State Voters | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Robert Verbruggen,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/the-tax-reform-did-not-discriminate-against-blue-state-voters/,"Follow Robert VerBruggen on Twitter April 22, 2019 10:14 AM
There’s a new study from the National Bureau of Economic Research out today called “ Did the 2017 Tax Reform Discriminate against Blue State Voters ? ” It’s a fairly interesting exercise, looking at how much extra money individuals will have to spend and calculating that, if the law is made permanent,
the average percentage increase in remaining lifetime spending under the TCJA is 1.6 percent in red states versus 1.3 percent in blue states. Among the richest 10 percent of households, this differential is larger. Rich households in red states enjoyed a 2.0 percent increase compared to a 1.2 percent increase among the rich in blue-state households. This gap is driven almost entirely by the limitation on the SALT deduction. Excluding the SALT limitation from the TCJA results in a spending gain of 2.6 percent for rich red-state households compared to 2.7 percent for rich blue-state households.
Good to know. But this is not proof of discrimination. Rather, it shines a light on the discrimination that took place in the old system.
The SALT deduction, as you may know, allows taxpayers to deduct their state and local tax payments from their federal returns. So when a state chooses to hikes its own taxes, it also secures its residents a tax break from the federal government, which in turn eventually has to either raise taxes or cut spending nationwide to make up for the lost revenue. This spreads the burden around to states that didn’t choose to hike their own taxes."

Cooke,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/the-democrats-have-hurt-themselves-by-lying-about-the-tax-cuts/,"April 22, 2019 9:59 AM House Speaker Nancy Pelosi leads Democrats in introducing the “For the People Act” legislation, January 4, 2019. (Jonathan Ernst/Reuters)
Pretty much every major outlet has now noted that the Democrats have been successful in their attempt to cast the 2017 Trump-led tax cuts as a tax increase . Here’s the New York Times on the topic :
To a large degree, the gap between perception and reality on the tax cuts appears to flow from a sustained — and misleading — effort by liberal opponents of the law to brand it as a broad middle-class tax increase.
Per the Times ,
The messaging stuck. In December 2017 , polling for The Times by SurveyMonkey showed that nearly two-thirds of Americans — and three-quarters of Democrats — did not believe they would get a tax cut from the new law. In this month’s poll, three-quarters of Democrats again said they did not think they got a tax cut from the law, and the overall share of Americans who said they had benefited rose only slightly from the 2017 expectations.
This, of course, does not comport with reality:
The Tax Policy Center estimates that 65 percent of people paid less under the law and that just 6 percent paid more. (The rest saw little change to their taxes.)
This is a problem for the Democrats.
Electorally, there is perhaps some short-term advantage to be gained from neutralizing — or even reversing — one of Trump’s reelection talking points. But, in the long run, the approach the Democratic party has taken here will be a lot less useful, because, in the long run, the Democratic party’s long-term aim is not to stick it to Donald Trump but to advance its political agenda. By attacking the tax cuts from the right , it has made that aim much, much more difficult to achieve.
In addition to their ever-present complaints about “the rich!” the Democrats’ attack on the 2017 tax cuts had three major prongs: Taxes on the middle class were increased, and this is bad; Some wealthier Americans in higher-taxed states saw tax increases, and this is bad; Some of Trump’s tax cuts will expire in 2027, and this is bad
The first of these attacks is an explicit, deliberate, outright lie. The second and third are essentially correct. What all of them have in common, however, is that they are all anti-tax arguments. This is a big problem for a Democratic party that cannot achieve its vision for America without raising taxes and spending — not just on “the rich,” but on the middle class, too.

Structurally, Trump’s cuts present an obstacle to the Democratic agenda — an obstacle that, eventually, will need to be removed. Quite how the Democrats intend to go about that from their present position is unclear. If, as seems to have happened, Congress can broadly lower taxes and voters can still be convinced that they were raised , there will presumably be hell to pay if Congress actually raises them."

Campus Free Speech or No Higher Ed Act Reauthorization | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Stanley Kurtz,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/fix-free-speech-or-no-higher-ed-act-reauthorization/,"April 22, 2019 10:17 AM (Carlos Barria/Reuters)
Today, the National Association of Scholars released a statement signed by over 100 prominent educators and public figures concerned with higher education. That statement calls on Congress to include protections for campus free speech in the next reauthorization of the Higher Education Act. Only by doing so, says the statement, can Congress “cease subsidizing unlawful behavior by public colleges and universities.” In other words, Congress needs to stop funneling money to colleges and universities that promulgate unconstitutional speech codes and so-called free-speech zones. Advertisement Advertisement
The Higher Education Act (HEA) of 1965 must periodically be reauthorized and updated by Congress. This is important because Title IV of the Act sets the ground rules by which institutions become eligible for federal student loans and grants. You can’t get a Pell Grant or a federal student loan unless you attend a Title IV eligible school. Today, many or most Title IV eligible schools fail to protect, and even flagrantly violate, the free-speech rights of their students. HEA must not be reauthorized without fixing this. Public universities that stifle free speech should lose their eligibility for federal financial assistance, while private colleges must at minimum make their free-speech policies clear and open (with the implication that they will thereby become contractually obligated to stick by them).
The NAS statement calling on Congress to include free-speech protections in its coming reauthorization of the Higher Education Act has been signed by prominent educators and writers such as Emory’s Mark Bauerlein, the University of Chicago’s Rachel Fulton Brown, George Mason’s F. H. Buckley, Chapman Law School’s John Eastman, Claremont McKenna’s Charles Kesler, UT Austin’s Robert Koons, the University of Oklahoma’s Wilfred McClay, Hillsdale’s Paul Rahe, and Ohio University’s Richard Vedder. Figures such as president of the Leadership Institute Morton Blackwell, president of the Intercollegiate Studies Institute Charlie Copeland, president of the Independent Women’s Voice Heather Higgens, and president of the Independent Women’s Forum Carrie Lukas have signed as well. Think-tankers with education expertise such as the Hudson Institute’s John Fonte and the Texas Public Policy Foundation’s Tom Lindsay have also signed on. (I was a signatory as well. And note that organizational affiliations are included for identification purposes only.) Advertisement
But didn’t President Trump already do all this just a month ago? Not quite. The president’s executive order on campus free-speech conditions a different pot of federal money — research grants — on speech protections at public and private universities. Although the research cookie jar is massive, it pales by comparison with the many hundreds of millions of dollars at stake in federal student loans and grants. Federal student loans also reach schools that undertake little or no federally sponsored research. And of course an executive order can be peeled back by a new president, whereas a law has staying power. Advertisement
If you think Congress must already be headed in this direction, you are seriously mistaken. All indications are that Congressional Republicans have decided against including free-speech protections in the coming reauthorization of the Higher Education Act, in significant part because House Democrats are refusing to go along. That has got to change. Congressional Republicans shouldn’t be running from this fight, they ought to be running on it instead. Advertisement
Campus free speech enjoys widespread bipartisan support. A recent McLaughlin & Associates poll showed 73 percent approval for a presidential order to protect campus free speech. So Democrats and Republicans can and should join together to include free speech protections in the new HEA. Sadly, national Democrats now seem so beholden to their radical base that even this sensible step has become impossible for them. If so, the correct response on the part of congressional Republicans isn’t capitulation. Instead, the GOP ought to make protections for campus free speech one of its 2020 campaign promises. If that means HEA has to wait for reauthorization until after the next election, so be it. By then the president’s EO will have road tested the mechanics of such an effort. Advertisement
President Trump understands the importance of this issue, but congressional Republicans still do not. Traditional liberal education is in meltdown. Campus conservatives are under siege; and even many campus liberals are afraid of the mob. Free speech in the academy is fading fast. The condition of our colleges and universities is becoming a serious concern for a great many Americans, certainly including conservatives. Yet GOP politicians have forgotten that Ronald Reagan won and held the governorship of California on this issue, which is every bit as prominent today as it was in the late sixties and early seventies when Reagan ran. The public overwhelmingly favors action to protect free speech on campus, yet congressional Republicans have been AWOL on the issue right through the height of the crisis. Yes, they’ve held hearings, but to no legislative effect.
This reflects a deeper problem in the conservative movement. The Reagan and H.W. Bush administrations energetically fought the campus culture wars, while conservatives remained fully engaged in that battle from about 1987 through 1997. As the radical left’s hold on K-12 and higher education solidified, however, conservative reactions split. Many bowed out of the fight, rolling their eyes at preposterous postmodern jargon and the wildly politicized “studies” programs, yet convinced it was all largely silly and harmless stuff. Let folks graduate, make a living, and start paying taxes and they’ll smarten up, these conservatives thought. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement
The sort of folks who signed today’s NAS statement were thereby reduced to rearguard voices warning that losing the education system to the Howard Zinn-left was bound to undermine the culture as a whole, the principles of constitutional government, and the political position of conservatives as well. With campus-style socialism and identity politics now in the cultural driver’s seat, conservatives under siege both on campus and off, and the country polarized between sixties-descended radicalism and a bunch of stubborn “deplorables,” it’s easy to see that campus political correctness has seeped into society and split the country in two.

NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.
So we’re already two decades late, but the GOP’s congressional leaders are still wearing blinders. Having run away from cultural issues for twenty years, Republican politicians are finding it tough to change their ways, even as the political winds regarding campus speech have shifted heavily in their favor. The mess on campus is so bad that the public has finally woken up. The NAS’s statement today is an attempt to get it through to our representatives in Congress that they had better wake up too. Advertisement
Some conservatives still oppose federal moves to protect campus free speech. I disagree. I’ve argued at length that when it comes to deregulation, the academy is anything but a typical case. Campuses are insulated from market forces by tenure and massive federal subsidies. Abuse of the tenure system has created an unbreakable intellectual monopoly on campus, and this has cemented the speech police in place. In the absence of outside intervention, nothing is going to change.
Some say that federal free-speech protections would be abused by future Democratic administrations to undercut campus conservatives. Unfortunately, President Obama’s wild campus overreach on Title IX shows that the Democrats are going to do that anyway. And what’s the worst that could happen? Would a president Bernie Sanders or Kamala Harris try to turn our college campuses into leftist ideological training camps? Too late! It’s already happened. Democratic presidential abuses on campus would only make the higher ed disaster more obvious, perhaps waking up semi-somnolent conservatives to the need for alternative institutions. In the near-to-medium term, Democratic attacks on campus freedoms would be the surest route to a political and cultural backlash. So go ahead Kamala, make my day.
But we are fast running out of time. In a generation or less, graduates of the ideological training camps once known as universities will end constitutionalism and conservatism in this country. Can you feel it happening already? How can you not? Then will come the weeping, wailing, and gnashing of teeth. “Why oh why didn’t we do more to save the education system when we had the chance? Why did we surrender the culture? Is it really all over? Is it really too late?” Well it will be, and soon."
Bernie Sanders's Fox News Town Hall & Democrat Copy | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Jim Geraghty,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/bernie-sanders-prime-time-town-hall/,"Follow Jim Geraghty on Twitter April 22, 2019 10:08 AM Senator Bernie Sanders (I, Vt.) speaks at a news conference to introduce the “Medicare for All Act of 2019” on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., April 10, 2019. (Aaron P. Bernstein/Reuters)
Over at Fox News Channel’s MediaBuzz , Howard Kurtz notices that Bernie Sanders got big ratings from his town hall on FNC, and now other Democratic presidential candidates are considering doing the same. The broadcast prompted President Trump to complain on Twitter that the Fox News team was “so smiley and nice” with Sanders and wonder why Donna Brazile is joining the network. (Someone has to give the interview subjects the questions ahead of time, right?) Advertisement Advertisement
Five observations . . .
One: The anchors and interviewers of the Fox News team are fairer and better at their jobs than their critics like to admit, and the Democratic National Committee’s ban on Fox News hosting a primary debate looks ridiculous after the fair treatment of Sanders. Despite the strong opinions expressed during Fox’s prime-time hours, the news crew — Bret Baier, Martha McCallum, and the rest of the team — want to ask tough but fair questions and won’t stack the audience with hostile questioners.
Two: Other Democratic candidates might not have the same resonance with the Fox News audience that Sanders did. There’s a lot of overlap between the Vermont senator and Trump’s messages in the vein of “You’ve gotten a raw deal from powerful elites, and the problems in your life are their fault.” A candidate like Kirsten Gillibrand isn’t going to have the same applause lines. Advertisement
Three: President Trump is better known than almost all of his critics, and most of them yearn to be denounced by the president by name — because this elevates the critic. If Trump watches Fox town halls, then a Democratic presidential candidate knows that with enough furious denunciation with the president watching is likely to bring a direct response on Twitter — suddenly putting a little-known candidate into the middle of the news cycle. Right now, for almost any Democratic candidate, doing a town hall with Fox is all upside. Advertisement"

(Alex Gallardo/Reuters)
Veteran reporter Bob Woodward said Monday that the intelligence community’s reliance on the infamous Steele dossier “needs to be investigated” in the wake of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s failure to corroborate many of the document’s key claims.
Woodward told Fox News’s Chris Wallace that he was disturbed to learn that the CIA cited information included in the Clinton-funded dossier in a rough draft of their January 2017 intelligence-community assessment detailing Russian election-interference efforts.
“What I found out recently, which was really quite surprising, the dossier, which really has got a lot of garbage in it and Mueller found that to be the case, early in building the intelligence-community assessment on Russian interference, in an early draft, they actually put the dossier on page two in kind of a breakout box,” Woodward said.
“I think it was the CIA pushing this. Real intelligence experts looked at this and said ‘No, this is not intelligence, this is garbage,’ and they took it out,” he continued. “But in this process, the idea that they would include something like that in one of the great stellar intelligence assessments, as Mueller also found out, is highly questionable. Needs to be investigated.”
Congressional Republicans have long demanded answers from the Department of Justice regarding how heavily the CIA and FBI relied on the Steele dossier when deciding to launch a counter-intelligence investigation into Russian interference in the election and possible collusion with the Trump campaign. Those lawmakers, led by Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, are now focused on determining to what degree information from the dossier was used to justify the FBI’s application for a FISA warrant to surveil former Trump national-security adviser Carter Page.
Republicans have escalated their demands for transparency in the wake of the release of the Mueller report, which disproved a number of key claims included in the dossier, including the allegation that Michael Cohen traveled to Prague to meet with Russian hackers.
Attorney General William Barr told Congress earlier this month that he has formed a team within the Department of Justice to look into the origins of the counter-intelligence investigation, and mentioned the dossier specifically as a point of inquiry.

Game of Thrones Episode Two Review: Speed Things Up | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Jonah Goldberg,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/game-of-thrones-episode-two-pace-problems/,"April 22, 2019 1:30 PM Kit Harington and Emilia Clarke in Game of Thrones (HBO) Spoilers below! I generally agree with much of what David has written about the first two installments of the final season of Game of Thrones. But I want to throw in a criticism I’ve been mulling. For a long time there were rumors that the final episodes of Game of Thrones would be extra long, perhaps even “movie-length.” After watching last night’s episode, I think that would have been better. The pacing of both episodes has been off. In the first, the reunions were almost all way too short. The conversation between Arya and the Hound should have been allowed to breathe, instead it butted-up against the reunion with Gendry which also seemed stunted. All of the interactions we’ve been waiting for were clipped. Sanda and Dany should have done a couple rounds. The romantic stuff between Jon Snow and Dany was visually cool (Dragons!), but felt like box-checking. Gotta show they’re still a couple! There are exceptions. For example, the interaction in episode one between Dany and Sam, as David has written, was really well done. And I did think the teaser shot of Jamie seeing Bran at the end of episode one was great and their conversation last night was just right. But in last night’s episode we had a bit of the reverse problem. I take David’s point about crafting the “deep breath before the plunge” but at times it felt like padding. And some of it came at the expense of some scenes that should have been drawn out. I, for one, would have loved to hear a lot more of Tyrion’s conversation with Bran. I’m of mixed minds about how they handled the most important conversation so far, between Jon and Dany about his real identity. This, after all, is the heart of the coming intrigue. Cutting it short for understandable reasons, while teasing her fearful contemplation of losing her claim to the throne might have been the right call. But there was another problem with last night’s installment. Because viewers have been trained to look for cues and clues who is next to die, much of the episode seemed like an effort for people to get their “Who’s about to buy the farm?” bingo cards filled out. It’s like that scene in Hardhome when the wilding mom tells her daughters she’ll be joining them soon on another boat — you knew she was about to become an ice zombie. The stuff with Grey Worm last night seemed like a textbook example of the how the gods — old, new, many-faced, and fire — laugh when man plans. The Knighting of Brienne, combined with her battle assignment, was indeed poignant. But it also felt like she was getting her metaphorical gold watch before her retirement as a character. I’m particularly worried that all of the talk about the crypt being the safest place is a huge setup for some close-quarter tragic carnage. I think if they had combined these two episodes into a single 90-minute-plus movie, they would have worked out a lot of these issues better, leaving episode two for the Mother of all Battles and the Final Four for the more interesting stuff. Of course, I could be wrong. We won’t know until we see the whole thing play out. But that’s how I felt as they unfolded."

Mexican authorities on Monday detained hundreds of Central American migrants in groups straggling at the end of a caravan of thousands moving towards the U.S. border.
As many as 500 migrants traveling with the caravan of about 3,000 were detained in the town of Pijijiapan in Chiapas, a Mexican state that borders Guatemala, according to the Associated Press.
Federal police and agents in patrol trucks and vans encouraged the groups to rest and later arrested men, women, and children as they paused in patches of shade. The migrants were driven to buses, likely for transport to immigration stations to begin the deportation process.

The crackdown, reportedly the largest single raid on a migrant caravan since the first one started moving last year, comes just after the Trump administration called on Mexico to take more action to stem the flow of migrants heading to the border.
As ports of entry and immigration stations in the U.S. have become more clogged with asylum seekers and other migrants, Trump threatened to shut down the southern border, saying the economic cost of doing so may be worth it."
Sri Lanka Bombings -- Do the Terror Attacks Only Resonate with the Far Right? | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Jim Geraghty,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/do-the-sri-lanka-terror-attacks-only-resonate-with-the-far-right/,"Follow Jim Geraghty on Twitter April 22, 2019 4:14 PM Blood stains appear on a statue of Jesus Christ after a bomb blast inside a church in Negombo, Sri Lanka, April 21, 2019.

I notice how quickly the story of the Sri Lankan church bombings turned into a story about what people were saying about the bombings — whether “Easter worshippers” was some sort of politically correct euphemism to avoid saying Christians, and now the Washington Post tells us that “the attacks, which targeted a religious minority in a predominantly Buddhist country, also resonated abroad — especially in Europe. To some, it was further proof that Christians in many parts of the world are under attack.” The “some” in that vague sentence are apparently “far right” figures around the world.

You know what else is going on in the world today? A general in Libya has turned against the government and is trying to overthrow the current rulers right now. Ukraine just elected a comedian as president. Egypt is voting on a referendum that would allow President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi to stay in office until 2030. This weekend ISIS terrorists attacked the Afghanistan Interior Ministry, and were killed after a three-hour gun battle with soldiers and police.

• Last year, I came to do a piece on a very grim subject: the murder of Mexican journalists (which happens a lot). Mexico City, I was told, was La Burbuja — The Bubble. People here are insulated from the violence that afflicts the rest of Mexico. Of course, this is true only to a degree — bubbles can be pierced.
Anyway, I don’t mind life in La Burbuja , not a bit. Mexico City, in its finer neighborhoods, is very pleasant to be in.

• Thanks to the Oslo Freedom Forum, which is holding a special session in Mexico City — focused mainly, but not exclusively, on Latin America — I meet Griselda Triana. She is the widow of Javier Valdez, one of the many Mexican journalists who have been murdered. I tell her I admire her for being out and about. She says, “There’s no choice.” I say, “Yes, there is: You could always stay in and hide. But you set an example for the rest of us.” Advertisement
She seems a warm, impressive person, Griselda Triana — lovable, too.
• I am very pleased to see Jan-Albert Hootsen, an old friend of mine: a Dutch journalist who is the Mexico representative for CPJ — the Committee to Protect Journalists. His career is two-fold (at least): He does his own reporting, his own journalism; and he works like hell to keep his colleagues alive.
• Hang on, what’s this? A statue of FDR, yes — a good likeness too, capturing the president’s jauntiness. But is he on his feet? At that age? Yes, he is. I don’t think I’ve ever seen a monument to Roosevelt that shows him on his feet. Want to see it?
N.B. FDR was the Democrats’ vice-presidential nominee in 1920, with James M. Cox. In that period, he campaigned on his feet. But not when he began running for president, in 1932.
• The session of the Oslo Freedom Forum will be held in Mexico’s grandest, best museum (or so I understand): the National Museum of Anthropology. I will show you a hunk o’ something historic near the entrance:
• On a busy street, I see a young man with a newspaper rolled up in his hand. Does this still happen? Newspapers rolled up, in the hands of young people? You can still witness this, yes. But probably for not much longer …
• Something else you can see on the streets of Mexico City — something modern, not old-fashioned: men in business suits, going to and from work on Segways.
• I thought this building was attractive — the Edificio Raúl Jorge. (No, I don’t know what goes on in there.) See if you agree:
• Asma Khalifa is an extraordinarily inspiring person. She is a young woman from Libya, who served as a nurse during that country’s civil war. One of her messages is: Hard as it may be, try not to demonize or de-humanize your enemies, or putative enemies. I’ve recorded a podcast with her. Again, an extraordinary person.
She made me think: “I have some shaping up to do my own bad self.” Advertisement Advertisement
• Asma’s husband, Bjørn Ihler, is also an extraordinary person. He is a Norwegian, one who survived that massacre in 2011. To read about him — and to hear him, too — go to a page from the Oslo Freedom Forum: here .
• “Ah, Rubén Darío!” exclaims Edipcia Dubón. We are passing the avenue named after him. Edipcia is a democracy leader from Nicaragua — a former congresswoman who had to flee the country, in the face of a merciless crackdown by the Nicaraguan dictator, Daniel Ortega. Darío was a Nicaraguan poet, who lived from 1867 to 1916. Like others who participate in the Freedom Forum, Edipcia is a joy and an inspiration. I will have a piece on her — and Nicaragua’s current horror — in the next issue of National Review .
Still, I wish you could meet her live and in the flesh. Advertisement
• In her opinion, who is the most famous Nicaraguan in the world? Bianca Jagger, right? (I see this lady pretty much every summer when I work at the Salzburg Festival in Austria.) Edipcia thinks about it: either her or Sergio Ramírez, she says. (He is a literary and political figure.) I vote Bianca. Advertisement

• The session of the Oslo Freedom Forum opens with a press conference. First to speak is my old friend Javier El-Hage, a Bolivian lawyer, an official of OFF, and a champion of liberty. He speaks about the dictatorships of Latin America: Cuba, Venezuela, Nicaragua (with Honduras ever more worrisome). He also speaks of liberal democracy. And he says something fundamental: Supporters of liberal democracy — left, right, or center — are allies. They should be allied with one another against dictatorship and other (less extreme) forms of illiberalism.
Let me give you a memory: Years ago, I was on an AIPAC junket to Israel (one of the most satisfying, and moving, trips I have ever taken). In our group were some left-of-center journalists. They wanted to debate policy: U.S. policy on Israel, Israeli policy on national security. My attitude basically was: You and I support the right of Israel to exist. Therefore, we are on the same side. We believe in the core thing: the right of Israel to exist. All the rest is detail — important detail, maybe, but detail nonetheless. When so many in the world do not support the right of Israel to exist, our shared support trumps all. Advertisement
Do you know what I mean? I should flush this out in a proper essay …
• An affable, urbane democrat at the conference is “Tuto” Quiroga, a one-time president of Bolivia (in the early 2000s). (He must have been a boy wonder, because he looks quite young now.) He cites an old bit of wisdom: If you are neutral between persecutor and victim, you are effectively siding with the persecutor.
• Inside the auditorium in the Museum of Anthropology, before the speeches begin, there is music playing: a jazzy Pachelbel canon. Not bad (and not good). Advertisement
• Thor Halvorssen greets the attendees. He is the president and CEO of the Human Rights Foundation, which is the parent organization of the Oslo Freedom Forum. The human-rights biz, he says, is a politicized one. HRF — and, by extension, OFF — is different. In the view of HRF/OFF, there are not good dictatorships and bad dictatorships. There are simply dictatorships, which stink.
• Giving the keynote address is Enrique Krauze, the Mexican historian, essayist, etc. He is — dread phrase — a public intellectual, and one of the foremost anywhere. In this talk, he emphasizes the importance, and the utility, of understanding all sides. Not agreeing with all sides, of course. But understanding them (as in Venezuela). He also speaks of freedom — which cannot be learned in books, he says, but rather is learned by hard experience.
• Bonil is a delight. He is a cartoonist from Ecuador. (Formal name, Xavier Bonilla.) No offense to him, but he looks sort of like a cartoon: with an animated, lively, extra-expressive face. For years, he tangled with Rafael Correa, the ex-strongman of Ecuador. (Correa has now been succeeded by a man named Lenin: Lenín Moreno.) Correa invited his followers to kill Bonil. None managed to do it, although many threatened it. Sometimes, they would cloak themselves in the mantle of Christ. Which is annoying.
As you would expect, Bonil is a humorous guy — cartoonists are bound to be. “He threatened to break my face. I told him, ‘How can you make it look worse than it already does?’” But his humor does not mask his bravery.
• In the museum’s collection is a big coin — well, not really: It’s a fantastic Aztec sun stone. (See it here .) But it’s on a coin: Mexico’s ten-peso one. Fascinating object, this stone, which, fortunately, a learned young Mexican explains to me.
• Outside the museum, there are the usual protesters — the protesters who always gather outside Freedom Forum events: commies, in short. I snap a picture from the lobby — not a good picture, but you can see the red flags:
I’m all for their right to protest. But, if they took power, would they allow me to protest? (Don’t bet the farm.)
• It is good to see Rosa María Payá — daughter of the heroic Oswaldo Payá, who was killed in an accident in 2012 (a suspicious accident). Oswaldo Payá was a Cuban democracy leader; his daughter is carrying on his work. Two years ago, I did a podcast with her: If you don’t know her, you will like her a lot ( here ). Advertisement
• It is good to see Chito Gascon, too. He is the chairman of the Human Rights Commission of the Philippines. He has a lot of work to do, as you can imagine. Governmental murder is in vogue over there …
• Leyla Hussein is an Anglo-Somalian — who tries to wake the world up about a grisly issue: female genital mutilation. It is not an exotic cultural or religious practice, she says. It is not something done by the Other, which the West should tolerantly accept. It is a brutal practice — an act of violence — with long-term harmful effects. Leyla is a crusader, but a crusader with abundant charm and flair, which aids the crusade, as I see it. I have podcasted with her a couple of times: in 2017, for example .
• At the museum, I podcast with Felix Maradiaga. He is a Nicaraguan political scientist, entrepreneur, and human-rights defender. Like Edipcia Dubón, he has had to flee his country. I talk with him about his life, and his country. A man both good-natured and formidable: Go here .
• It is so easy to take democracy for granted — when you live in a democracy. It’s easy to pick at it too — when you live in a democracy. But those without democracy don’t take it for granted — quite the opposite. And they can’t afford to pick.
• There is a young man behind a hotel desk. He is a keen student of literature, and a keen student of English. He gives me the names of some Mexican writers: Have I ever read them? No, and I haven’t heard of them either, I’m afraid. He wants the names of some American writers to read — writers of fiction. And in fairly straightforward English. I suggest Hemingway. He has never heard of him. Neither has he heard of Fitzgerald. But he is eager to explore Hemingway, and to give The Great Gatsby a shot.
The world is wide, so wide. You can never hear of everyone. What’s a big deal to one person is a blank to another — and something to discover.
• In a park, I happen upon a monument to Paul Harris — the founder of Rotary International. Harris lived from 1868 to 1947; he founded Rotary in 1905. This is one of my favorite organizations. It has done mountains of good in the world. As I recall, a writer in The New Yorker once sneered at John Dos Passos, long ago. Dos Passos had been a brilliant figure on the left — and now, said the writer, Dos Passos had embraced the worldview of a Rotarian. “Rotarian” was a great putdown. Well, they can put me down, too.
Here is that monument:
• I like benches of this type — do you? I would never sit on one — uncomfortable as hell. But nice to look at:
• Behold, Blessing Corset, for all your corset needs:
• Mexico City — and Mexico at large — is famous for color. Have a little color:
• A little more color? Well, an orange Bug never hurts:
• I meet a man who speaks pretty good English. He has traveled in America a bit. He has been to New York, Miami, Chicago, L.A., Montana …
Whoa, Montana? I myself haven’t been to Montana. How did that happen?
Years ago, he studied English, briefly, at Gonzaga University, in Spokane, Wash. His roommate was from Montana. And this roommate took him home for Thanksgiving. The young Mexican had a proper turkey dinner. He also made a Mexican meal for the family — though the ingredients were hard to obtain.
We all love Thanksgiving, of course. I also love the tradition of taking foreign classmates home for it.
• Having lunch with David Luhnow, the Latin America bureau chief for the Wall Street Journal , and José de Córdoba, a correspondent in the same bureau, is at least two things: an education and a ball.
• Here is a tall, tall statue — of Francisco I. Madero, “Apostle of Democracy.” What a difference a letter makes: “Madero” vs. “Maduro.”
• Lots of young mothers in Mexico City — and not of babies either, but of elementary-school kids.
• I hear someone cry out, “Ándale, ándale, ándale!” Makes me smile. Advertisement
• As throughout the world, parks in Mexico City are chiefly for two classes of beings: dogs and lovers (and dog lovers, I guess) …
• I have to adapt from Dr. Johnson: He who is tired of bougainvillea is tired of life."
Elizabeth Warren's Student-Loan Plan: Weighing the Costs | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Jim Geraghty,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/the-morning-jolt/the-cost-of-elizabeth-warrens-student-loan-plan/,"Follow Jim Geraghty on Twitter April 23, 2019 9:42 AM Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) speaks to reporters after announcing an exploratory committee to run for president in 2020 in Cambridge, Mass., December 31, 2018. (Brian Snyder/Reuters) Making the click-through worthwhile: In the aftermath of Elizabeth Warren’s proposal to have the government pay for everyone’s student-loan debt, there’s an even bigger and bolder proposal to cover something else; Joe Biden is still close to jumping in but not quite there and some questions about suburban Democrats and Bernie Sanders. You Think Government Paying Off All Student Loans Is a Big Idea? Try This One . . . My fellow Americans, Yesterday my rival for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, Elizabeth Warren, recently proposed wiping out all of the student-loan debt for 75 percent of borrowers, at cost to taxpayers of $640 billion. As a candidate for the 2020 Democratic nomination, I can only say that Warren is a miserly cheapskate. Because today I am calling for something truly bold: wiping out all mortgage debt for all borrowers. Because what good is a taxpayer-funded college education if you have a hard time affording a home at the end of the day? My plan would cover all $10.3 trillion in mortgage debt that Americans currently owe. The arguments in favor of having the government pay for your student-loan debt are every bit as applicable to having the government pay for your mortgage debt. For example, Warren contends her student-loan debt plan would “provide an enormous middle-class stimulus that will boost economic growth, increase home purchases, and fuel a new wave of small-business formation.” If you think covering student-loan debt would do this, just imagine how much bigger the middle-class stimulus if no one ever had to scramble for funds to pay a mortgage ever again! Warren argues “a public-college education is like a public K-12 education — a basic public good that should be available to everyone for free with zero debt.” Good heavens, how can she say that college education should be a basic public good, but not a home? Perhaps not everyone wants or needs to go to college, but everyone needs a home. How could Warren possibly be so cold and heartless that she is deaf to the cries of millions of Americans who are struggling to pay their mortgages? In many communities, mortgages cost even more than a higher education — and many homeowners spend 30 years paying off this debt! Is it really fair to see so many American families having to scrimp and save and put off other purchases just because they want to live in a home and took out a six-figure sum to purchase a house and signed a contract promising to pay it off, with interest, over a period of three decades? How on earth is it fair to tell people who freely entered agreements to keep their promises and honor their obligations, even if it’s difficult? Warren says her plan would “substantially increase wealth for Black and Latinx families and reduce both the Black-White and Latinx-White wealth gaps.” By having the government pay for everyone’s mortgage, Black, White, and “Latinx” families that purchased homes will instantly all have the same debt: zero. True equality and fairness for all, with the snap of our fingers, as a bold and driven leader once said . If the federal government is going to pay off the student loan debt of 42 million Americans who owe up to $50,000, there’s no reason it shouldn’t also pay off the mortgage debt for everyone. Now, we know this plan will encounter skeptics and haters and wrongthink. As Warren said, “Some people will say we can’t afford this plan. That’s nonsense.” Like her, I’ll echo that used-car-salesman technique of arguing we can’t afford not to spend this money. Some will say, “The entire federal budget including all spending of every kind is $3.8 trillion, and your plan will cost almost three times that.” I say that these people just don’t care about the poor and downtrodden. Warren has proposed an “Ultra Millionaire Tax” on families with more than $50 million in wealth. We know this is a more serious proposal than a mere millionaire’s tax because it has the word “ultra” in it. Even better than Warren, I have proposed a “Super-Duper Millionaire Tax” that will surely only hit people richer than you and could never ever have any bad effects on the economy or unforeseen consequences. If there’s anything history has taught us, it’s that rich people never alter their economic activity or shift their assets in response to changes in tax law. My initial idea was that this tax would only affect the richest man in America, but my staff told me that could cost me the endorsement of the Washington Post . I wanted to hit Jeff Bezos with an income tax, but apparently that lunatic’s base salary at Amazon is about $81,000. So under the “Pillage Like a Viking” provision of the Super-Duper Millionaire’s Tax, the IRS would simply seize everything he has, and that would pay for about $132 billion. Only $8.7 trillion to go! Oh, and I guess we can eliminate the home-mortgage interest deduction from the tax code, since no one will have any mortgages anymore. Like Warren, I decry the fact that states are spending less per-student on public institutions of higher education than before. Unlike Warren, I read a little deeper into the studies and found that the main reason for the decline in higher-education funding is “state Medicaid spending is the single biggest contributor to the decline in higher-education funding at the state and local level” as well as “K–12 education; public welfare (which includes most Medicaid spending, Supplemental Security Income, food stamps, and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families); health and hospitals; police and fire protection; and corrections.” In other words, one of the reasons state universities aren’t getting as much money as they used to is because politicians like me chose to increase spending on all the other stuff we like to promise on the campaign trail. Whoops. Studies like this make it sound like we have to prioritize and compromise, and that taxpayers are not an endless fountain of money that can always be squeezed further. I reject arguments like this, because the foundation of my worldview is that we can always spend more money, and I fear telling anyone, particularly voters, that they cannot have something they want. As a progressive Democrat, I’ve been accused of being hostile to business, but my plan to shift mortgage debt from home purchasers to the federal government has already been endorsed by lots of big companies: Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Chase, Quicken, PennyMac. I figured my reputation for supporting higher taxes and more regulations would scare away big business from this idea, but when I announced my intentions for this plan, the representatives of these big lenders leaped up from the table and started dancing, and started singing about “no more worrying about borrowers defaults on mortgages, ever,” or something. They then suggested that my plan could end foreclosures, forever. This idea is even better than I thought! Then the National Association of Home Builders said they could endorse the plan if it extended to new potential homebuyers, as well as existing ones. See, Americans? I’m a uniter, not a divider. If the mortgage lenders and homebuilders like my plan to pay off the debts, university administrators must have reacted to Warren’s plan like Meg Ryan in the diner in When Harry Met Sally. Like Warren’s student-debt plan, I’m calling my mortgage-debt plan “an investment in our future.” Paying for her investment would cost almost 20 percent of our current tax revenue. But under my plan, a better America, free from worry about affording a home, is within our grasp, and all it will take is . . . between $10 trillion and $11 trillion in the first year. That’s only three times our current federal tax revenue and just half of our current annual gross domestic product ! For What Feels Like the Millionth Time, Here Comes Biden Joe Biden was originally going to announce his presidential campaign tomorrow, but he’s now pushing it back, according to Edward-Isaac Dovere of The Atlantic. Biden vs. Trump would be a fascinating matchup. Because as we’ve seen in recent weeks, Biden by himself is something of a liability. Too old, gaffe-prone, more or less at odds with the loudest corners of the Democratic party’s grassroots . . . and for better and worse, he’s nothing new. On paper he’s “a return to normalcy,” but he’s not all that “normal.” If Biden wins the nomination, he would probably have Barack Obama out on the campaign trail a lot . But you figure Biden would put every state Obama won at least in play, and if you’re a Democrat, that looks pretty good. I’ve been thinking about Bernie Sanders and how the Democratic elites react if he’s the nominee. America’s suburbs are full of soccer moms in households making six figures who are appalled by Trump but who don’t particularly want a socialist revolution. They don’t fume about the big banks, because they have accounts in those banks, and perhaps work there. They’ve got a good health-insurance plan through their employer and would worry about their quality of care under Medicare for All. They’re concerned about climate change but still bought a Lexis LUV (luxury utility vehicle). These voters want something like the Obama status quo — lots of symbolic progressivism, but policies that allow them to continue enjoying the good life — and maybe getting a big tax deduction for buying a Tesla or putting solar panels on their roof. In a Trump-Sanders matchup, do these voters start looking at . . . Howard Schultz? ADDENDA: I’m scheduled to chat with John Phillips of KABC around 10:35 a.m. Eastern this morning — 7:35 a.m. Pacific, if my math is correct — about how every candidate has to get a prime-time town hall from CNN, and now quite a few want one with Fox News channel.

During last night’s CNN town halls, Bernie Sanders endorsed reinstating the voting rights of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the Boston Marathon bomber, and Kamala Harris indicated that she was open to the idea. Anne Carlstein, a junior at Harvard, asked Sanders, “Y ou have said that you believe that people with felony records should be allowed to vote while in prison. Does this mean that you would support enfranchising people like the Boston Marathon bomber, a convicted terrorist and murderer? Do you think that those convicted of sexual assault should have the opportunity to vote for politicians who could have a direct impact on women’s rights? ”
Sanders responded:
SANDERS: So here is — Anne, to answer your question, as it happens, in my own state of Vermont, from the very first days of our state’s history, what our Constitution says is that everybody can vote. That is true. So people in jail can vote. Now, here is my view. If somebody commits a serious crime, sexual assault, murder, they’re going to be punished. They may be in jail for 10 years, 20 years, 50 years, their whole lives. That’s what happens when you commit a serious crime. But I think the right to vote is inherent to our democracy, yes, even for terrible people, because once you start chipping away and you say, well, that guy committed a terrible crime, not going to let him vote. Oh, that person did that, not going to let that person vote. You’re running down a slippery slope. So I believe that people commit crimes, they paid the price. When they get out of jail, I believe they certainly should have the right to vote. But I do believe that even if they are in jail they’re paying their price to society, but that should not take away their inherent American right to participate in our democracy.
Harris said “W e should have that conversation. ”
LEMON: Another issue that I want to talk to you about — this is really important — I’m not sure if you were watching earlier, but Senator Bernie Sanders said that he is in favor of felons being able to vote while serving in prison. He was asked specifically about people like the Boston Marathon bomber, also people who are convicted of sexual assault. And he said, this is a quote, “The right to vote is inherent to our democracy, yes, even for terrible people.” Do you agree with that, Senator?
HARRIS: I agree that the right to vote is one of the very important components of citizenship and it is something that people should not be stripped of needlessly, which is why I have been long an advocate of making sure that the formally incarcerated are not denied a right to vote, which is the case in so many states in our country, in some states permanently deprived of the right to vote.
And these are policies that go back to Jim Crow. These are policies that go back to the heart of policies that have been about disenfranchisement, policies that continue until today, and we need to take it seriously. Advertisement Advertisement

(Brian Snyder/Reuters)
Senator Bernie Sanders (I., Vt.) distanced himself Monday from his past endorsement of government ownership of the means of production, telling the audience at CNN’s town hall in New Hampshire that he’s moderated his views since his time serving as the mayor of Burlington in the 1970’s.
Asked by an audience member whether he plans to implement the kinds of policies that caused her parents to flee the Soviet Union in 1979, Sanders sought to distinguish between “authoritarian communism” and the “democratic socialism” he now promotes. “Is it your assumption that I supported or believe in authoritarian communism that existed in the Soviet Union? I don’t. I never have, and I opposed it. I believe in a vigorous democracy,” he said, before adding that he believes government should play a significant role in reducing wealth inequality and providing health care and education.
CNN’s Chris Cuomo then confronted Sanders with an interview he gave to the Burlington Free Press in 1976, in which he advocated “the public ownership of utilities, banks and major industries.”
Sanders emphasized the date of his remarks and said that he has never moved to nationalize industry during his political career. Stay Updated with NR Daily

“I was a mayor of a city for eight years. Did I nationalize any of the industry in the city of Burlington, Vermont? I don’t think so.

"Kamala Harris, Impeachment & Lowering Voting Age: Conversation Needed | National Review",www.nationalreview.com,John Mccormack,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/kamala-harris-impeachment-voting-age-changes/,"Follow John McCormack on Twitter April 23, 2019 12:27 PM Senator Kamala Harris (D, Calif.) at the North America’s Building Trades Unions (NABTU) 2019 legislative conference in Washington, D.C., April 10, 2019. (Yuri Gripas/Reuters) It’s time for a conversation about the senator’s equivocations.
I f you want to know which way the wind is blowing in the Democratic primary, just watch Kamala Harris.
Asked about impeaching President Trump on Saturday, the California senator and presidential candidate said : “I believe that there is room for that conversation, but right now what I want is, I want Mueller to come before Congress to testify. I want to be able to see the full unredacted report, and specifically also the underlying evidence.” But by the time Harris appeared on CNN Monday night for a town-hall meeting in New Hampshire, she had apparently heard enough of the conversation going on inside the Democratic party to make up her mind. “I believe that Congress should take steps towards impeachment,” Harris said, following the lead of Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren, who had called for impeachment last Friday. Advertisement Advertisement
Harris and Warren were joined by South Bend mayor Pete Buttigieg in pushing the party towards impeachment during Monday night’s CNN town halls. “I think he’s made it pretty clear that he deserves impeachment. I’m also going to leave the House and Senate to figure that out,” Buttigieg said. Of the five Democratic presidential candidates who appeared on CNN Monday night, only two stopped short of calling for impeachment. Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar said she wouldn’t prejudge the matter because, as a senator, she would effectively serve as a juror in any impeachment case against Trump. And Vermont senator Bernie Sanders called for a “thorough investigation” but expressed concern that if the House moves toward impeachment, the political debate will be focused on “Trump, Trump, Trump and Mueller, Mueller, Mueller” — not the progressive/socialist domestic-policy agenda.
Sanders may be lagging behind his colleagues in his enthusiasm for impeachment, but make no mistake: He is driving the conversation inside the Democratic party on matters of policy. When asked about Elizabeth Warren’s proposed federal program to forgive up to $50,000 per person in student-loan debt, Sanders pointed out that he is the intellectual godfather of such plans. Sanders said that four years ago, everybody was saying: “Bernie is a little bit crazy, talking about making public colleges and universities tuition-free.” Advertisement
“Ain’t such a crazy idea today,” Sanders added. Advertisement
Indeed. And on Monday night, Sanders did more to display his power to make previously extreme ideas seem mainstream in his party. When asked specifically if the Boston Marathon bomber and those convicted of sexual assault should be able to vote while they’re incarcerated, he answered in the affirmative. Pete Buttigieg answered the same question with a simple “No.” But Kamala Harris equivocated: “I think we should have that conversation.”
Asked later about lowering the voting age to 16, Harris said: “I’m really interested in having that conversation.” Some Democratic bigwigs now think it’s time to have a conversation about Kamala Harris’s interest in “having that conversation.” Advertisement
“At some point this could end up being a problem,” David Axelrod, a former Obama adviser, said last night on CNN. “She is an incredibly compelling personality; a very bright and accomplished person. But she’s very cautious — and that caution was pretty apparent in a lot of her answers.”"
Few Students Gripe So Duke Cans a Popular Professor After 20 Years | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,George Leef,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/a-few-students-gripe-so-duke-cans-a-popular-professor-after-20-years/,"About George Leef April 23, 2019 11:05 AM
A few years ago, a leftist prof wrote a piece in which he admitted that he was “ terrified “” of his students. I’d say that most professors should feel that way, particularly if they teach at a school with an administration dominated by “ progressives. ” Comments
Today’s Martin Center article provides support for that view. It’s by Evan Charney, who taught at Duke for 20 years and was a very popular professor. But all it took to end his career was complaints from a few hypersensitive leftist students who said his teaching style made them uncomfortable. Even though many students came to Charney’s defense, that meant nothing at a school where “ woke ” students must be appeased."
Kevin McAleenan & Migrant Families -- DHS Secretary Says Separating Families 'Not Worth It' | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Mairead Mcardle,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/news/dhs-secretary-separating-migrant-families-not-worth-it/,"April 23, 2019 3:21 PM Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Kevin McAleenan addresses a news conference in Washington, D.C., October 29, 2018. (Jonathan Ernst/Reuters)
Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Kevin McAleenan said Tuesday that border authorities are not considering resuming the separation of migrant families, a practice that was ended by the Trump administration last year after it drew outrage from both sides of the aisle.
“We’re not pursuing that approach,” McAleenan said . “Prosecuting violations of the law does have a consequence and it does deter behavior but it [does] not work if you lose the public trust.”
The DHS secretary added that the separation policy was “not worth it” from an enforcement perspective.
DHS’s “zero tolerance” immigration-enforcement policy was spearheaded by former Attorney General Jeff Sessions. The family-separation component of the policy continued for at least a year until President Trump signed an executive order last June ending it. Stay Updated with NR Daily

“We’re going to have strong, very strong borders, but we’re going to keep the families together,” Trump said at the time. “I didn’t like the sight or the feeling of families being separated.”
The government never had a concrete plan to reunite separated families, according to documents that emerged as part of a court battle over the policy. And while the precise number of separated families is unknown, it is believed to be in the thousands."

Former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton said Tuesday that President Trump would have been indicted over the actions described in Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report had he not been a sitting president.
“I think there’s enough there that any other person who had engaged in those acts would certainly have been indicted,” Clinton said during her remarks at the Time 100 Summit. “The whole matter of obstruction was very directly sent to the Congress. And if you read that part of the report, it could not be clearer.”
Mueller concluded in the report that Trump and his associates had not engaged in collusion with Russia but declined to weigh in on whether a number of Trump’s actions during the investigation — including his decision to fire FBI director James Comey and his attempts to have Mueller fired — constituted obstruction of justice. The report instead left that determination up to Congress. Stay Updated with NR Daily

Elizabeth Warren's Student-Debt Proposal: 'Broadly Progressive'? | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Robert Verbruggen,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/elizabeth-warrens-student-debt-proposal-broadly-progressive/,"April 24, 2019 10:20 AM Sen. Elizabeth Warren
I had to chuckle at this from Jared Bernstein :
The Warren plan expends resources on student debtors from upper-income families, but it is still broadly progressive. Analysis from experts at Brandeis University, the University of Tennessee, and Arizona State University shows that among low and moderate-income families — those in the bottom 40 percent of the income distribution — close to 90 percent of borrowing households would have their student debt wiped out compared to just under 30 percent of those in the top 10 percent. Similarly, the proposal provides total cancellation for about 90 percent of those with an associate degree or less but provides total cancellation for about only 25 percent of those with a professional degree or doctorate. (Because student debt rises with household income , the plan could be made more progressive and less expensive by lowering the $50K cancellation amount).
It’s funny because this calculates the progressivity of student-loan relief the way conservatives calculate the progressivity of tax cuts.
As I spelled out in this post , there are a lot of different ways to do the math on “progressivity,” and they led to very different conclusions about the 2017 GOP tax law. If you just look at raw dollar amounts, the rich got a lot more (simply because they pay the most in taxes to begin with) — making the policy look ridiculously regressive. If you look at percentage changes to after-tax income, things look quite a bit better. If you look at percentage changes to federal taxes paid, things look better still. And if you ignore payroll taxes and just look at changes to income taxes paid, the policy is actually ridiculously progressive, with some people at the bottom getting a 100 percent tax cut (though they paid very little in income taxes to begin with and saw no change to their much higher payroll-tax burden)."
Donald Trump's 2020 Election Victory Chances are Very Real | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Jim Geraghty,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/the-morning-jolt/realistically-trump-could-win-in-2020/,"April 24, 2019 9:48 AM President Donald Trump declares a national emergency at the U.S.-Mexico border in Washington, D.C., February 15, 2019. (Carlos Barria/REUTERS) Making the click-through worthwhile: A deep dive into how President Trump’s outlook for 2020 is brightening, and how Democrats are giving him an exceptionally easy target; the Florida supreme court backs firing America’s least-favorite sheriff; and the Democratic donor class shifts from Beto O’Rourke to Pete Buttigieg. Sabato Is Right. It Is Easy to See How Trump Can Win in 2020. Larry Sabato greets Washington Post readers with a headline that many of them probably didn’t expect to see or want to see: “It’s easy to see how Trump can win reelection.” Sabato : Credit the powers of incumbency and a strong economy, the state of which may matter more to Trump’s odds than nearly anything else. Incumbency and the economy, among other matters, ended up being more than enough for Nixon, Reagan and Bush. Despite Trump’s unprecedented outlandishness, that same combination might work for him, too. Let’s get our “to be sure” paragraph out of the way. To be sure, Trump’s approval rating in Iowa, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin is in the low to mid-40s, and his disapproval is above 50 percent, which is ominous. ( Apparently Pennsylvania Republicans are particularly nervous about 2020 .) He’s narrowly underwater in Arizona and Florida. His approval rating in Georgia, Indiana, and North Carolina is barely ahead of his disapproval rating. In Minnesota, a state Trump lost by only two percentage points in 2016, Trump’s approval is just 37 percent. If Trump’s share of the vote is equal to the percentage of Americans who currently approve of him, he’s toast. But elections are not just referendum on whether voters approve of the incumbent; they’re a contrast between two or more options. Democrats were completely convinced that not only did Hillary Clinton have the more likable persona in 2016, but that she had the more appealing set of proposals: “comprehensive immigration reform,” a public option for health care, gun control, overturn Citizens United and allow the government to limit spending on political speech and messaging, tax increases on income of more than $5 million and $275 billion on new infrastructure spending. As conservatives, we may disagree with all of that or almost all of that, but we can acknowledge that those are, at least when described generically, reasonably popular proposals — particularly with voters who don’t bother to look at the details. And then . . . she lost, to a guy who kept going on about building a big beautiful wall and making Mexico pay for it. The 2020 crop of Democrats are running on an extremely different set of proposals: Reparations for slavery . Decriminalizing entering the country illegally . Tearing down existing border barriers . Abolishing the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency . Expanding the size of the Supreme Court to change the balance of the current justices . Eliminating the filibuster in the Senate (even though that’s not something the president controls). Eliminate private health insurance entirely . Eliminate the Electoral College . Have the federal government guarantee a job for every citizen . And, as Bernie Sanders suggested earlier this week , restoring the right to vote to everyone, including felons serving life sentences for violent and heinous crimes. Those are much more controversial proposals than Hillary’s agenda in 2016. These are the sorts of ideas that Republican candidates dream of running against, and the sorts of issues that make attack-ad makers giddy with anticipation. We’ve heard a lot about how Donald Trump alienates once-Republican-leaning soccer moms in the suburbs — and he does. There are a bunch of soft Republicans out there who just want their taxes low, their streets safe, and their terrorists dead. They’re not all that worried about illegal immigration, they think health care is too expensive but are wary about any changes to the insurance and doctor they currently have, they’re unnerved by gun violence and mass shootings and they recoil in horror from anything that even vaguely resembles white nationalism. But these kinds of voters are not itching for a socialist revolution, or a complicated scheme of wealth redistribution that studies your genealogy for connections to slavery, or open borders, or rewriting the Constitution. You hear a phrase from Never-Trumpers, the Trump-skeptical, and the Trump-weary with increasing regularity: “All the Democrats have to do is not be crazy, and they can’t even do that.” Some of these folks are looking for a Democrat to support, some want “a return to normalcy,” and some just want to feel the hope that the United States could have a new president on 2021 who is less flawed than the current one. The status quo with Trump has some serious flaws. Only two things really get Trump motivated: the opportunity to boast and repeat praise of himself from other people, and the opportunity to lash out at critics. You see it in his pro forma first tweet of the day about some current event or serious issue, and then the following half-dozen tweets about “PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT!” and “ENEMIES OF THE PEOPLE!” and furious denunciations of something some pundit said on television about him. He can’t recruit good staff, abuses and publicly humiliates the people who are willing to work for him, and has a dysfunctional level of staff turnover. This White House is perpetually disorganized and unprepared; remember how there was supposed to be this formal written response to the Mueller report? Apparently, we’re not going to get one. The president keeps describing dictators in unnervingly kind terms and seems wildly naïve about Kim Jong Un. But . . . we haven’t had a military conflict in North Korea. The Islamic State has been smashed. When Trump’s proposals go beyond what is permitted under U.S. law or the Constitution, the federal judiciary and Supreme Court step in and limit him. Despite the claim that Trump is an authoritarian or an aspiring dictator, his party lost the House of Representatives. The economy is largely thriving and unemployment is low. We’re an energy-exporting powerhouse. The federal judiciary is filling up with originalist judges who will provide a check on government excesses for a generation. Trump signed bipartisan criminal-justice reform into law. “Right to try” has given new hope to thousands facing serious diseases. Iran’s economy is getting hit hard by the reinstated sanctions. The individual mandate in Obamacare is repealed. The Food and Drug Administration is setting records for the number and speed of its generic drug approvals . As a status quo, this is pretty good! Many of Trump’s more emotionally charged critics warned us his presidency would be a dystopia, a combination of The Handmaid’s Tale , The Day After Tomorrow , 1984 , and maybe throw in bit of the ABC miniseries Amerika for the notion of a government controlled by Moscow. Look out your window. You probably don’t see a dystopia; you may not see a country all that dramatically different from 2016.

NRPLUS Conference Call with Rich Lowry and Victor David Hanson | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Philip Devoe,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/nrplus-conference-call-with-rich-lowry-and-victor-david-hanson/,"April 24, 2019 12:34 PM (NRO Illustration: Elijah Smith)
Yesterday morning, NR editor in chief Rich Lowry spoke with author and historian Victor Davis Hanson to members of the NRPLUS group on a private conference call. The pair discussed the Mueller report, Victor’s decision to support Trump, and Victor’s life on a farm in Fresno, Calif.
Rich and Victor started the call by discussing the release of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on President Donald Trump’s alleged collusion with Russia and obstruction of justice. Victor described the report as a reflection of Mueller’s team, who he says were all non-Republicans tasked with the job of finding evidence of collusion regardless of whether collusion was present. Indeed, the first volume didn’t suggest any evidence was found. But by packing everything damning of Trump into Volume II, the team managed to accomplish the job the Left wanted them to accomplish. Advertisement Advertisement
Victor says that impeachment isn’t likely, as long as the economy remains strong and the United States doesn’t enter another war, but the progressive Left will continue to pursue it regardless of the presence of these triggers, which makes stopping the impeachment train harder. Arguing on their terms won’t work, Victor explained, and only a counter-offensive will. This counter-offensive would bring to light improper behavior by those on the Left, including Andrew McCabe or James Comey. For example, how did Comey and the FBI find their contacts if it wasn’t through John Brennan or people talking through Congress? There’s a lot of legal exposure, Victor says. Once the Right begins to pursue that, the push for impeachment will lessen.
Next, Victor explained why he made his decision to support Trump for president, as he wasn’t a supporter until near the end of the campaign. He offered three reasons. First, he was witnessing his neighborhood, which used to be a very safe, multi-ethnic community of farmers, becoming dangerous. Just a quarter of a mile away from his farm, several illegal activities began popping up. Second, he was seeing what happens when progressivism takes over. California was passing new taxes and new laws designed to make the state better, but Victor didn’t see many positive changes. Third, on his trips to Stanford University, he would witness cultural progressivism, in the form of unanimous support for sanctuary cities, safe spaces, trigger warnings, and more. Victor added that he believes many other people in the country grew tired of Marquess of Queensbury Republicans, who would call victory even with a narrow electoral loss and then go out for drinks with their opponent like divorce lawyers after a case.

The hosts then turned to questions from NRPLUS users, who were participating via the Facebook page and the plus@nationalreview.com email. One user asked whether the toxicity in American culture is unprecedented and how we can move forward to unite the country. Victor explained that we have had many eras during which the U.S. was unstable, but the things that people were protesting against was something even the other side had sympathy for. The issues now are issues without consensus. The force multiplier of all of these dissensions have created two cultures: The East and West coasts and middle America. Victor’s colleagues have been all over the world, and yet never to Fresno, Visalia, or Bakersfield, which are between four and five hours away from San Francisco. That’s scary, Victor said. And if Trump gets elected to a second term, Victor says he believes that California is going to ramp up the aggressive defiance of the president’s. Advertisement"
Professor Mark Kleiman of NYU's Critique | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Kevin D. Williamson,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/new-york-university-mark-kleiman-critique/,"April 24, 2019 2:01 PM Professor Mark Kleiman (Wikimedia)
I’m going to pick on Professor Mark Kleiman of NYU’s Marron Institute of Urban Management for a bit, and not just because I’m cheesed about his suggesting, wrongly and dishonestly, that an easily checked fact in a piece of mine is a “flat-out lie.”
(To be clear: Professor Kleiman wrote that the claim was false and then rhetorically asked whether it was a “flat-out lie,” which is a tediously familiar form of passive-aggressive intellectual cowardice .) Advertisement Advertisement
The times being what they are, I am fairly used to misrepresentations of my writing and my views; I am asked on a fairly regular basis about things I’m alleged to have written (and tweeted) that are pure invention—by which I do not mean taken out of context, distorted, etc., but simply made up out of whole cloth, pure fabrication. This is pretty common stuff on social media, usually from anonymous trolls or sad Media Matters types.
But it matters a great deal more when it’s an NYU professor, even on Twitter. If we are to have a functional democratic discourse, then we need functional and reliable institutions. Another way of saying that is that NYU is not the only loser when NYU professors develop a reputation for intellectual dishonesty: The rest of us need NYU professors to be reasonably honest, too. We need the news pages of the New York Times to be more or less non-fiction, irrespective of their point of view. We need public-radio journalists to forgo reporting as fact fictions about “ exploding bullets .” We need conservative commentators who can tell the difference between a Jewish child in Nazi-occupied territory and an agent of the Third Reich .
A lie from a putatively authoritative source such as Professor Kleiman takes on a life of its own. One response to him on Twitter reads:
They [meaning National Review ] don’t care if they publish lies as long as it means they “win”, i.e., means they get their agenda fulfilled. It’s all about winning, not truth, when it comes to these right-wing tools. In short, @NRO doesn’t care that he lied, because his lie fits their agenda.
So there’s a made-up “fact”– that I lied to my readers about teachers’ compensation — and then a morally satisfying story that partisans tell themselves about that fiction. The prestige of an institution such as NYU is an intellectual tool and, like any tool, it can be used in a responsible way or in an irresponsible way. Professors have a particular professional duty to use their tools responsibly. Sometimes, they need a little help in that. Stay Updated with NR Daily

Bias is a problem, but this isn’t really a question about bias. I know what Mother Jones ’s biases are, but if I read a news story in that magazine that says x , y , or z happened, I am reasonably confident that the facts of the case are things that actually happened, however loopy the point of view Mother Jones might bring to those facts. Journalists make errors, of course, as do professors, and the better ones correct them. But they generally do not make things up. Advertisement
The problem for professors such as Mark Kleiman is two-fold. One is the basic structure of social media, especially Twitter, which rewards and encourages outrage and expressions of tribal affiliation. The other (distinct but not entirely unrelated) problem is the hysterical political tenor of our times, which justifies intellectual dishonesty and pig-brained partisanship as expressions of moral urgency and markers of moral seriousness. Hatred is taken as a warrant for dishonesty—and nothing comes more naturally to the inferior kind of mind than hatred and dishonesty. Advertisement
My forthcoming book, The Smallest Minority , is in large part about this kind of thing and the way it undermines our democratic discourse. Advertisement
It’s an unhealthy thing for Republicans and conservatives to hear something unwelcome from an NYU professor or the New York Times and dismiss it out of hand with a sneering admonition to “consider the source.” But it’s an even more unhealthy thing for rage-addled mediocrities such as Professor Kleiman to give them reasons to do so.
For the record, I emailed Professor Kleiman about his error to give him a chance to correct himself. He refuses to do so. He did write to claim that “no reader is going to think salary-plus-benefits.” The piece in question plainly states that the number cited refers to salary and benefits — twice , in fact. I suppose it’s possible that he did not actually read my column. Likely, even, I suppose: He also wanted to know why I’m not more critical of President Trump and military spending, so he’s pretty clearly operating in the dark. Advertisement "

President Trump said Wednesday that he plans to fight all subpoenas issued by congressional Democrats in their investigation of his administration, including requests for his financial records and for the full, unredacted Mueller report.
“We’re fighting all the subpoenas,” the president told reporters outside the White House before heading to a summit on the opioid crisis in Atlanta. “The subpoena is ridiculous. We have been, I have been the most transparent president and administration in the history of our country by far.”
Since retaking the House in January, Democrats in the lower chamber have opened numerous investigations of Trump’s administration and personal finances. They have subpoenaed the president’s financial records, including his tax returns, and have asked former White House counsel Don McGahn to testify to his claims, laid out in the Mueller report, that Trump asked him to have Mueller fired."
Abortion & Washington Post: Editorial Misrepresents Polling & Pro-Life Law | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Alexandra Desanctis,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/washington-post-editorial-misrepresents-abortion-polling/,"April 24, 2019 2:26 PM The Washington Post Company building in Washington, D.C., 2012 (Jonathan Ernst/Reuters)
A Washington Post editorial on abortion regulations published yesterday evening begins with one misdirection, ends with another, and fills its middle with so many obfuscations it would take a great deal of time and space to unpack them all. Let’s focus on just a couple.
The editorial begins with the claim that “public support for abortion rights is at its highest since . . . Roe v. Wade ,” citing just one poll that shows 67 percent of voters believe abortion should be legal in “all” or “most” cases. This cherry-picking of data entirely ignores a variety of studies that show the trend on Americans’ views of abortion moving in precisely the opposite direction. Advertisement Advertisement
A majority of Americans still describe themselves as “pro-choice,” but according to recent Marist polling, more than three-quarters say they support restricting abortion to, at most, the first trimester. That statistic includes a majority of Democrats and a majority of those who call themselves pro-choice, an incredibly under-reported reality. Last summer, meanwhile, Gallup found that fewer than one-third of Americans support allowing abortion after the first trimester — and that just 13 percent of Americans say abortion should be legal in the third trimester.

NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.
That last figure matters, of course, because Democratic lawmakers in New York, and Virginia, and Rhode Island, and Illinois, and New Mexico, and Vermont have spent the first few months of 2019 pushing policies to allow abortion, for any reason whatsoever, until the moment of birth. We witnessed a fight in the U.S. Senate over the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, which would have required doctors to provide medical care to newborn infants who survive attempted abortion procedures. Forty-four Democratic senators voted against that bill, and it failed to pass."
Climate Change & Progressives’ Environment Hypocrisy -- Conservatives Should Step In | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Todd Myers,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/environmental-hypocrites-of-the-left/,"April 24, 2019 2:34 PM (Heinz-Peter Bader/Reuters ) Why progressives refuse to live by their own Earth Day bluster
G eorge Monbiot recently expressed a carefully calibrated environmental message that allows people on the environmental left to feel self-righteous without making any real sacrifice. In a video that was shared widely, including by celebrities such as James Corden, the British writer argues that the only way to help the environment is to change the “big, structural, political economic stuff.” Monbiot concludes that we need to “go straight to the heart of capitalism and overthrow it.” At the same time, he dismisses “pathetic, micro-consumerist bollocks which just isn’t going to get us anywhere.” Advertisement
This is absolution for those who want to feel green but can’t be bothered with going to the effort and expense of actually living their own values. Publicly advocating the “do as I say, not as I do” approach reinforces the reality that conservatives tend to live out the environmental ethic that the Left only preaches.
As a conservative who has worked in environmental policy for two decades, I have been frustrated watching as ideological fellow travelers avoid environmental topics, even as they privately express their commitment to environmental stewardship. As the Left becomes more detached from responsible and effective environmental solutions, conservatives should confidently fill the void.
One reason conservatives do not engage is that environmentalism has become synonymous with horrible government policy. Every Earth Day, we are treated to theatrical images of marches featuring unhinged activists demanding action on a range of environmental issues. Clever hashtags are generated. Alarmist slogans are flaunted. Naked people glue themselves to park benches. And all who disagree with the demands for more government power are denigrated as “deniers.” Advertisement
The other 364 days of the year, however, people on the left do little in their daily lives to justify all that environmental browbeating. A study by researchers at the University of Michigan and Cornell University found that those who are “highly concerned” about climate change are “least likely to report individual-level actions” to reduce their environmental impact. Those who considered themselves “skeptical” of climate change “were most likely to report engaging in individual-level pro-environmental behaviors.” To be sure, not all conservatives are skeptical of climate change, but generally, we aren’t nearly as alarmist about climate change or other environmental issues, even when we recognize the risk. Advertisement
That gap between the Left’s loud talk and their unwillingness to make personal sacrifices is not an accident. It is now part of their dogma. Individual actions are mere “bollocks,” useless gestures. Only the sacrifices made by others will make a difference. Advertisement
This dichotomy is evident in my home state of Washington, where politicians pride themselves on showing “leadership” in the effort to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. This year, our legislature enacted a law requiring the state to meet a 100 percent renewable-energy target by 2045. Environmental activists tweeted their support, saying they “demand action now” and worrying about the climate crisis.
Ironically, though, many who demand action do little of it themselves. For only a few dollars a month, anyone who supports renewable energy can already buy renewable-energy credits (RECs), ensuring that there is enough renewable energy on the grid to cover their personal use. I asked one politician pushing for the 100 percent–renewable requirement if she buys RECs to cover her environmental impact. She admitted that she does not and has no plans to do so. Advertisement
This is consistent with the message of Monbiot and political leaders pushing the Green New Deal. Personal sacrifice is of little consequence, so why even try? Even as they call for an end to air travel, politicians who demand we impose lifestyle change have not curtailed their own carbon-producing travel, despite living in the era of HD video conferencing. Advertisement
The most effective environmental efforts are often small, personal actions in which people have skin in the game. Farmers find ways to conserve water because waste costs money. Aluminum cans are lighter today because it saves resources and they cost less to ship. Homeowners and businesses conserve energy because they pay the price for every kilowatt-hour. When they don’t save, they change course, unlike politicians who fear public embarrassment and throw good money after bad.
This isn’t just a theory. The amount of energy per unit of GDP in the United States has fallen steadily for several decades. There are no sharp drops. Instead, the improvement is gradual and constant, as individuals and businesses find ways to squeeze a bit more out of their energy use. Politicians can lecture all they want, but these are truly the front lines of environmental stewardship."
Christopher DeMuth & American Interest -- From Balanced Budgets to Borrowed Benefits | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Matthew Continetti,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/from-balanced-budgets-to-borrowed-benefits/,"April 24, 2019 2:20 PM (Marcos Brindicci/Reuters)
Christopher DeMuth has written another extraordinary essay. This one appears in The American Interest under the headline “ Welfare and Debt: A Moynihan Assessment . ” His starting point is a speech on public finance delivered by Daniel Patrick Moynihan in the winter of 1986. Moynihan used the occasion to contrast federal budgets before and after the Reagan tax cuts. It was an unfavorable comparison. Reagan, he said, had purposely deprived the federal government of revenue in order to constrain spending. The upshot was an explosion in the national debt. “ The largest debtor nation with a declining defense program, ” Moynihan said, “ is not likely to remain for long the symbol of successful government. ” Advertisement Advertisement
Moynihan wasn’t entirely right in his assessment. The tax cuts, DeMuth observes, were not intended to limit spending. They were meant to promote growth. “ Deficits ballooned in the mid-1980s mainly because Paul Volker’s Federal Reserve reduced inflation faster than anyone had anticipated. ” Reagan’s defense buildup was necessary to deter the Soviet Union. But Moynihan did have a “ big, singular insight. ” The “ political economy of the federal government ” underwent a dramatic change in the last quarter of the twentieth century that has persisted into the 21st. The government once provided public goods. Now it finances private consumption. “ Altogether, through good times and bad, deficit spending and payments for individuals have grown in tandem for nearly fifty years. ”"

The practices under this president, the practices under the last president, where families were broken up . . . we don’t need those internal roundups and deportations and enforcement.”
“We were taking children from their mothers and fathers after having completed a more than 2,000-mile journey fleeing the deadliest places on the planet today, trying to follow our own asylum laws, and I would argue being illegally blocked and rejected and arrested and separated and caged by this president and this administration,” he added."

The redacted version of Mueller’s report, which sent shockwaves through Washington when it was released Thursday, concluded that “the evidence was not sufficient to support criminal charges” related to the Trump campaign’s contacts with Russia but left up to Congress the decision of whether to charge Trump with obstruction of justice.

'The White Crow' Review: Unsentimental Tale of Rudolf Nureyev’s Defection | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Armond White,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/the-white-crow-movie-rudolf-nureyev-unsentimental-tale/,"April 24, 2019 7:36 PM Oleg Ivenko in The White Crow (Sony Pictures Classics) Ralph Fiennes avoids patronizing platitudes about poor immigrants.
I n The White Crow , young Rudolf Nureyev (played by Oleg Ivenko) first arrives in Paris to perform with St. Petersburg’s Mariinsky Theatre ballet troupe, but his immediate desire is to visit the Louvre. “I want The Raft to myself,” he says, referring to Géricault’s 1818 large-scale masterpiece The Raft of the Medusa . Nureyev’s yearning is significant to his character and his striver’s experience in the Soviet working class. Art is the raft that carries Nureyev from strict Russian conformity to the freedom his individual egotistic personality needs and that he finds in the West. Advertisement Advertisement
There is so much patronizing in contemporary immigration film — usually about Africans, as in Grianfranco Rosi’s Fire at Sea , or about Central Americans, as in Cary Joji Fukunaga’s Sin Nombre — that we have lost sight of the most important principles. The White Crow observes immigration experience through the idiosyncrasy of a famous artist rather than in “humanitarian crisis” platitudes, the meanings of which shift according to whoever is mouthing them.
Because Nureyev’s citizen-of-the-world identity is not a political issue, The White Crow avoids the usual sanctimony associated with Western attitudes toward immigration. (Think of those maudlin Statue of Liberty tales that politicians exploit and movies rarely get right – only Jim Sheridan’s In America and the first half of Paul Mazursky’s Moscow on the Hudson came close to justifying “beautiful mosaic” corniness, and it eventually succumbed to piety.) Advertisement
As The White Crow ’s title suggests, its perspective derives from the Russian folk metaphor of “the white crow,” which describes an unusual person, an outsider. The film is clear-eyed about immigration because it focuses on a privileged artist’s selfishness, the part of his humanity that is inseparable from his ambition and probably inherent to his talent.
Ivenko actually resembles Mikhail Baryshnikov, but he can certainly dance the Rudolf role, and he plays it with youthful zest. Nureyev’s first emotional connection in the West comes when he breaches KGB protocol at an official meet-and-greet by daring to approach French dancer Pierre Lacotte (Raphaël Personnaz). Lacotte looks at the brash Russian with intense interest — two pairs of wide eyes flash. Advertisement
In their commiseration on the roof of the Paris Opera, Lacotte tells Nureyev, “Art is to learn from.” This turns out to be the guiding principle of director Ralph Fiennes (who also plays the role of Nureyev’s ballet instructor, Pushkin) and screenwriter David Hare. Key scenes of Nureyev in isolated rehearsal sessions are intercut with scenes of the infatuated dance protégé and tourist enraptured at the Louvre; his close examinations of large, sensual, smooth-muscled sculptures serve almost as fantasy allegories for his sexual privacy. Advertisement
Fiennes and Hare steer clear of banalities — including the subplot of Pushkin’s insistence that Nureyev live with him and his wife, which leads to fairly restrained infidelity and hints of deviance (although some Ken Russell brazenness might have gone deeper). Fiennes and Hare’s discretion emphasize cultural appreciation over politics, which ultimately unbalances the narrative: When Nureyev makes his 1961 defection, the meaning of the event — confirming memories of The Raft — doesn’t have the dramatic impact they should.
Nureyev’s stubbornness is well established in scenes where he haughtily joins the Parisian elite, especially a restaurant scene with socialite Clara Saint (Adèle Exarchopoulos) that raises class fears from his background. It will figure in the famous moment at Le Bourget airport when he is poised between KGB officials and French police and fearfully contemplates his steps toward asylum. Advertisement Advertisement
The individual’s sense of freedom characterized his artistic reputation. “Your technique is clumsy, but your spirit is perfect. You take the stage!” Lacotte says with admiration. Clara Saint, a helpful intimate of André Malraux’s, France’s minister of culture, encourages boldness when insisting that Nureyev fight his fears and ask for what he wants. Either Hare fumbles this decisive incident or Fiennes stages it poorly."
Politics in ‘Game of Thrones’ and ‘The Walking Dead’: A Conservative Interpretation | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Kevin D. Williamson,04-25-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/game-of-thrones-walking-dead-politics-conservative-interpretations/,"April 25, 2019 6:30 AM Game of Thrones (HBO) Both Game of Thrones and The Walking Dead are obliged by the nature of their dramatic structures to consider the fundamental questions of politics, and both invite deeply conservative interpretations.
C onservatives are acutely aware of our pop-cultural deficit, and sometimes argue that we need more conservative stories on film, on television, on stage, in books, etc. But we do not need more stories that are conservative — we need more stories that are true.
The great works of art that appeal to the conservative sensibility rarely if ever are constructed as self-consciously conservative stories — propagandistic literature lends itself more readily to progressive causes, in any case. What Coriolanus tells us about populism and mass politics is not true because it is conservative but conservative because it is true. The relationship between the beautiful and the true helps to explain how it is that so many actual Communists in Hollywood’s golden age produced works that were moving, true, often patriotic, often speaking to religious faith, and in many cases profoundly conservative. They weren’t out to make something right-wing, but something great. Advertisement Advertisement
I doubt very much that either Game of Thrones or The Walking Dead is the product of an overwhelmingly conservative group of storytellers. (From what I can learn of the politics of the writers, that does not seem to be the case.) But both shows are obliged by the nature of their dramatic structures to consider the fundamental questions of politics, and both invite deeply conservative interpretations.
The Walking Dead is, at this point, a show that is only incidentally about zombies. It is mainly a story about the origins of political order, one that has taken several different approaches to Mancur Olson’s idea of the state as a “stationary bandit.” Olson argues that political order has its origins in ordinary rapine and pillaging — at some point, his theory goes, the bandit begins to understand that his own interests are better served not by razing the villages, massacring the farmers, and burning the fields, but by leaving his victims with just enough to survive and to continue producing — so that there is something for him to loot next season. (Murray Rothbard and others made similar arguments describing the origins of the state as organized crime.) As the bandit begins to identify his own long-term well-being with that of his victims, he discovers incentives to stay in one place rather than roam hither and yon in search of new victims — a dangerous undertaking even for the most ruthless of bandits. He takes a proprietary interest in his victims’ property, which he begins to protect from rival bandits. The spoils of pillage become tribute, feudal duties, and, ultimately, taxation. Advertisement
But reality is not much like “Whig history,” in which mankind and its polities move inevitably and invariably in the direction of progress and prosperity. Nations move backward and forward: Part of the shock and horror of the Holocaust is the result of the fact that it was undertaken not by a tribe of illiterate cannibals but by what had been Europe’s most culturally advanced nation. Venezuela has not always been what it is today. Neither has the United States. Advertisement Advertisement
The first part of The Walking Dead ’s broad political arc has to do with the attempts of former sheriff Rick Grimes, a partisan of the law in a totemic lawman’s hat, to establish something like the rule of law in the post-apocalyptic chaos. He tries a bit of democracy and finds that wanting, but he continues to work toward a settlement based on rules and procedure rather than ad hoc savagery. And he fails . Much of the plot is the story of Grimes devolving into just another wasteland warlord, albeit one with some conscience and sense of decency. As the survivors begin to coalesce into semi-permanent settlements, they deputize one of their members to draw up a constitution — but a series of crises turns her into one of the coldest warlords of all. She is not a bad person, but the opposite: loving, loyal, fair-minded, deeply humane. She becomes a kind of left-handed military dictator not because of her vices but because of her virtues. She ends up being a kind of mirror image of the nefarious Negan , another warlord who sought not violence and domination for its own sake but order and security.
Many of the characters from The Walking Dead would quickly understand the facts on the ground in Westeros, the troubled kingdom(s) in which Game of Thrones ’s titular contest takes place. Game of Thrones is, at its core, a Shakespearean succession drama: Something is out of place in the state, and the gears of the social machine must grind until a new stable settlement is reached. ( Game of Thrones ’s opening sequence, which presents Westeros as a series of complex machines, is well-conceived.) To Shakespeare’s political sensibility it adds a Dickensian scope, considering the life of the kingdom from many different vantage points: kings and courtiers, yes, but also slaves and prostitutes, religious leaders, children, common people, and literal outsiders, the “wildlings” who live beyond the wall that demarks the northern limits of civilization. Advertisement
The unhappy reality at the center of the political economy of Game of Thrones is one of particular interest in the Western world just now: that, as the proverb has it, great men seldom are good men, that the characteristics that make one an effective leader — a leader who is genuinely of use to his people — often are the characteristics that make one a god-awful human being. And the converse: that many of the virtues of good men make them poor leaders in difficult times. Jon Snow, who recently (and at the most inconvenient of times) has learned that he is presumably the legal heir to the Iron Throne, is a decent, fair-minded, liberal man — and an almost completely incompetent leader of men. His first real command (of the border patrol, essentially) ends with him being murdered by mutineers. (He is resurrected.) In trying to unite the kingdoms against the same threat that Sheriff Grimes et al. faced – zombies — he ends up getting romantically involved with the conquering Daenerys Targaryen, who believes herself to be entitled to sit on the throne. (She is also his aunt, but he did not know that when he first went to bed with her.) That romantic entanglement leads enemies and allies both to question his motives and calculations — and not without good reason. Advertisement Advertisement
Daenerys, on the other hand, is a power-mad megalomaniac — and, so far, a much more effective leader. She may be traveling the world freeing slaves, handing down rough justice, and building multinational coalitions for her own selfish reasons, but she understands her own reasons. She knows what she wants, and that she has to give the people she rules what they need if she is to achieve her own ambitions. This is not a matter of mere calculation: Like most successful megalomaniacs, she sincerely believes that her own destiny is fundamentally identified with the good of the people she rules and those she means to rule. She can be transactional when necessary, and will take good advice when she recognizes it, but she is a true believer, too: in herself. Advertisement
The Walking Dead offers its survivors a couple of clear choices: They can have peace, trade, security, material prosperity, the rule of law, and cooperation, or they can have slaughter and brigandage. The choice would be obvious to almost everyone — if not for the presence of the external threat and the trauma of social collapse. Game of Thrones offers a less clear choice, but does make an implicit case for things like federalism and the separation of powers, inasmuch as most of the Seven Kingdoms’ domestic troubles come from the fact that whoever sits on the Iron Throne expects not only to reign but to rule, and that the very different peoples of the kingdoms are, corporately, ungovernable — not even by terror, as the assassination of the Mad King makes clear. Again, it is possible to imagine how a modus vivendi might have evolved, if not for the external threat of the White Walkers and the privations of the long winter.
That these stories should resonate so strongly in our own political moment is a little strange. Unlike, say, at the height of the Cold War, there is no existential foreign threat to the United States and our way of life. Unlike, say, 1968 or 1861, there isn’t very much in the way of political violence at home, either. These are reasonably peaceful and prosperous times. Advertisement
But our mood is not the mood of peaceful and prosperous times. That is, I think, the result of a series of earlier crises, minor and major, that were stacked on top of one another in a particularly destructive way: the convulsion of the 2000 presidential election, in which many Democrats believed (with varying degrees of good faith) that they were robbed by the Supreme Court; the events of September 11, 2001, shortly thereafter; the sense of paranoia and crisis on both sides of the political aisle that followed; the confusion about the Iraq War and its casus belli ; the 2008–09 financial crisis; that extraconstitutional abuses of the Obama administration and the criminal misdeeds of the IRS and other agencies during those years; the emergence of procedural maximalism as a congressional political norm. Even with the Soviet menace, Vietnam, stagflation, etc., the majority of Americans spent most of the postwar era feeling relatively safe and secure in a way that no longer really holds. There is a sense that our constitutional order has fallen into disorder, that the system — as figures as different as Donald Trump and Elizabeth Warren insist — is rigged."
Jeff Sessions: Mueller Report Results Should be Accepted | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Jack Crowe,04-25-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/news/jeff-sessions-urges-congress-to-accept-the-results-of-mueller-report-and-move-on/,"April 25, 2019 8:40 AM Former U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions addresses a news conference in Washington, D.C., October 26, 2018. (Jonathan Ernst/REUTERS)
Former attorney general Sessions urged Congress, and the country at large, to “accept the results” of special counsel Robert Mueller’s recently-released report and move on to other matters of governance during a speech at Amherst College on Wednesday. “I think it’s about time to accept the results, and let’s get on with the business of America,” Sessions said during a speech to the college Republicans, according to the New York Times.
While Mueller failed to prove the underlying crime of coordination with the Kremllin, he did detail a number of instances in which Trump tried to curtail or otherwise affect the probe. Sessions cautioned Congress against pursuing their current agenda of further investigating whether the behavior attributed to President Trump in the Mueller report constitutes obstruction of justice. “The process was followed and a decision has now been rendered,” he said, adding that he had “the greatest confidence in the integrity of our system.”
Sessions recused himself from the Mueller probe after it was revealed that he failed to report his meeting with Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak, a decision that soured his relationship with President Trump, who repeatedly castigated him in public and private for failing to “protect” him from the investigation."
Trump Trade Deal with Mexico & Canada: What Congress Should Insist On | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Mattie Duppler,04-25-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/trump-trade-deal-mexico-canada/,"About Mattie Duppler April 25, 2019 6:30 AM President Trump with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto (left) and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau at the USMCA signing ceremony in Buenos Aires, Argentina November 30, 2018. (Kevin Lamarque/Reuters) Consumers and businesses alike want the threshold for taxes and duties on imports to be high, not low.
W ith a divided government and another presidential-election cycle already in full swing, it’s tempting to think that any priorities of the Trump administration are dead on arrival in Congress. However, do-nothing gridlock is not inevitable: The renegotiated NAFTA deal (the U.S.–Mexico–Canada Agreement, or USMCA) offers an opportunity for progress on important trade policies even in a heated and divided political environment. Advertisement Advertisement
The White House has launched a legislative-affairs offensive to get House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and recalcitrant Democrats on board with the agreement. This has raised the suspicions of some Republicans, who are concerned that Democrats will be granted too much latitude in negotiations and that the agreement will be soiled by left-leaning priorities. There are several reasons that Republicans should worry less about Democrats’ public posturing on the trade deal and instead focus their efforts on preserving consequential trade policies that could be affected by the agreement.
First, it is important to remember that the USMCA negotiations are closely governed by the mechanisms set up by Trade Promotion Authority, or TPA. Passed by a Republican-held Congress and signed into law by President Obama in 2015, TPA requires Congress to pass “implementing” legislation for any trade agreement to take effect. This bill may include only language that is “strictly necessary and appropriate” to conform U.S. laws to the agreement. This effectively limits what can be added to the agreement by Congress.
This is perhaps why some Democrats have called for reopening negotiations with Canada and Mexico, acknowledging they will be unable to write far-reaching changes into implementing legislation. The Trump administration has already said that is a non-starter, and, because a new administration has taken the reins in Mexico since the deal was inked, the Democrats’ demands would likely be unacceptable to the other partners to the treaty. Advertisement
TPA also requires the administration to submit to Congress a list of changes that are required to bring U.S. law into accordance with the trade agreement. Unfortunately, changes to tax-free and duty-free treatment of imports under the “de minimis” threshold were included on list the Trump administration sent earlier this year. The de minimis level is the dollar threshold for imports at which duties, taxes, and other import barriers are enacted. Congress in 2016 agreed to raise this threshold from $200 to $800, acknowledging that the reduction of import restrictions on lower-value goods benefits American consumers and businesses. In fact, this position was so widely accepted, the 2016 bill to increase the de minimis threshold passed easily, with overwhelming majorities in both the House and the Senate. Advertisement
While an outright reduction of the threshold would likely be prevented by the restrictions imposed by TPA, it is important that Congress protect the current standard in any implementing legislation to USMCA. Advertisement"

FBI and IRS agents on Thursday raided the home and city hall offices of Baltimore mayor Catherine Pugh as part of an investigation into possible public corruption, the Baltimore Sun reported.
Pugh took a leave of absence from her position earlier this month after it was revealed that she made $500,000 selling copies of her Healthy Holly children’s-health book to the University of Maryland Medical System (UMMS) while sitting on the system’s board.
It was later revealed that health insurance provider Kaiser Permanente paid Pugh $100,000 for 20,000 copies of the book while the company was seeking a lucrative contract to insure the city’s employees.
In total, Pugh made $800,000 selling copies of her book to local entities since 2011, according to the Sun .
Agents also raided the Maryland Center for Adult Education, a local non-profit that Pugh used to run, as well as her attorney’s offices.
Maryland governor Larry Hogan responded to the news of the raids by calling on Pugh to resign in a Thursday morning statement. Stay Updated with NR Daily

“On April 1, I directed the state prosecutor to investigate the disturbing allegations surrounding Mayor Catherine Pugh’s questionable financial dealings with the University of Maryland Medical System…Now more than ever, Baltimore City needs strong and responsible leadership,” the statement read. “Mayor Pugh has lost the public trust. She is clearly not fit to lead. For the good of the city, Mayor Pugh must resign.”
Pugh apologized in March for having “done something to upset the people” and returned $100,000 to the UMMS. She has maintained, however, that she did not exploit her position for personal financial gain."

National Debt: Republican Politicians Borrow from the Future | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,George Will,04-25-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/national-debt-federal-budget-republicans/,"April 25, 2019 6:30 AM (Pixabay) Under a Republican president and, until four months ago, Republican control of both houses of Congress, the nation is about to run trillion-dollar budget deficits.
Washington — Pursed lips and clucked tongues signaled disapproval among the wise and responsible when, at a recent televised event, Senator Bernie Sanders, the “democratic socialist” from Vermont, did not plausibly explain how he would pay for Medicare for All. The remarkable thing, however, is the quaint expectation that any political person should explain how he or she would align proposed expenditures and actual revenues. For decades, the implicit answer has always been the same: They won’t even pretend to align them. Advertisement Advertisement
Under a Republican president and, until four months ago, Republican control of both houses of Congress, the nation is about to run trillion-dollar budget deficits with the economy expanding and employment more than full: The unemployment rate is 3.8 percent and, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there are 7.1 million jobs unfilled. As the birth rate declines, the population ages (approximately 10,000 Baby Boomers turn 65 every day) and the country is told to be alarmed because too many would-be immigrants are trying to enter the country and its workforce.
Yet Sanders is supposed to hew to some archaic standards of fiscal probity? Why should an avowed socialist be held to standards of fiscal candor and prudence that have no discernible adherents in the avowedly conservative party? Advertisement
Congressional Republicans are led on a short leash by a president who, as a candidate, vowed to not touch entitlement programs that are significant drivers of the deficit, and who breezily promised to eliminate the national debt (currently $22 trillion) in eight years. (Today, that would mean eight reductions of $2.75 trillion, a sum equal to 63 percent of the fiscal 2019 budget.) Republicans, now thoroughly disarmed concerning the issue of fiscal probity, struggle to frighten the 2020 electorate with the specter of spendthrift socialists threatening the Republic.
The Manhattan Institute’s Brian Riedl notes that this year, as the national debt, which was $10 trillion in 2008, heads toward $38 trillion in 2029, the federal government will spend $35,148 per household and collect $26,677 per household in taxes. Householders are understandably content with this arithmetic.
For guidance on how to think about what the political class does not think about (and wishes you would not think about), read “Welfare and Debt: A Moynihanian Assessment” by Chris DeMuth of the Hudson Institute. In 1986, when the national debt was a mere stripling, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D., N.Y.) delivered an address titled “The Moral Dimensions of a Two Trillion Dollar Debt,” in which he pondered the virtue, for nations as well as individuals, of self-denial — forgoing present pleasures for future benefits. Even 33 years ago he saw that our public debt is morally “problematic”:
The people who do the borrowing, which is to say elected officials, are not the ones who will do the repaying. The temptation is real to use debt not as a form of investment, but a means of consumption. Far from the denial of gratification, it can, and frequently does, reflect just the opposite.
DeMuth says that in 1986 Moynihan was “stunningly perspicacious” about “one big thing,” which DeMuth calls “a transformation of the political economy of federal government.” From the Founding until the fourth quarter of the 20th century, the political economy — the government’s taxing and spending — had been used primarily to provide “public goods” such as defense, diplomacy, courts, infrastructure, schools, basic research. Suddenly, however, the political economy became “primarily a provider of private consumption by individuals.” Yes, primarily. DeMuth:
In 1960, public goods had accounted for about 75% of federal outlays net of interest payments on the debt, while ‘payments for individuals’ were the other 25%. By 1970, payments for individuals had grown to 35%. In 1986 when Pat spoke, payments for individuals had become dominant at 55%. Today they are 75% and still growing; public goods are now the residual 25% of our national government and shrinking.
What DeMuth calls the new “borrowed-benefits” budget norm is financed to a significant extent by borrowing from nonconsenting future generations. The benefits are current consumption “and are not going to generate returns to pay off the borrowed funds.” This, says DeMuth, is just one facet of “our comprehensive rejection of constraint — not only in public finance but in politics, in constitutional structure, in rhetoric, and in culture.”"
"Relativism, Nihilism Threaten 21st Century West | National Review",www.nationalreview.com,Michael Novak,04-25-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/awakening-from-nihilism/,"April 25, 2019 6:30 AM Michael Novak In Preparation for the 21st Century, Four Lessons from the 20th
Editor’s Note: This essay is adapted from a speech given by Michael Novak at Westminster Abbey upon receiving the Templeton Prize in 1994. It is reprinted with permission of the Novak family.
A s we draw near the close of the 20th century, we owe ourselves a reckoning. This century was history’s bloodiest. At a time they didn’t choose, and in a way they didn’t foresee, more than a hundred million persons in Europe found their lives brutally taken from them. Beyond the war dead, 66 million prisoners perished in the Soviet labor camps. Add the scores of millions dead in Asia, Africa, and the other continents since 1900. Nor is there any guarantee that the 21st century will not be bloodier. Advertisement Advertisement
And yet the world has drawn four painful lessons from the ashes of our century. First, even under conditions of nihilism, better than cowardice is fidelity to truth. From fidelity to truth, inner liberty is wrested.
Second, the boast of Stalin, Mussolini, and Hitler that dictatorship is more vigorous than “decadent democracy” was empty. It led to concentration camps.
Third, the claim that socialism is morally superior to capitalism, and better for the poor, was also empty. It paved the road to serfdom. Advertisement
Fourth, vulgar relativism so undermines the culture of liberty that free institutions may not survive the 21st century. Advertisement
The First Lesson: Truth Matters
For three centuries, modernity has been supremely fruitful in its practical discoveries — in its magnificent institutions of political and economic liberty, for example. But it has been spectacularly wrong in its underlying philosophy of life. An age that is wrong about God is almost certain to be wrong about man.
History, Hegel once remarked, is a butcher’s bench. Homo homini lupus. “Solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.” Many sober inquirers, who saw how prodigally in this century the bodies of individuals have been thrown around like sacks of bones, understandably asserted that God is dead. Since this foul century began, how many terrorized children have spent long nights, uncomprehendingly, in tears?
And yet, in this night of a century, a first fundamental lesson was drawn from the bowels of nihilism itself: Truth matters. Even for those unsure whether there is a God, truth is different from a lie. Torturers can twist your mind, even reduce you to a vegetable, but as long as you retain the ability to say “yes” or “no” as truth alone commands, they cannot own you. Advertisement
Further, as the prison literature of the 20th century (a very large literature, alas) testifies abundantly, truth is not simply a pragmatic compromise, although torturers present it so. “It is such a little thing,” they say. “All you have to do is say ‘yes,’ sign here, and this will all be over. Then you can forget about it. What harm will come of it? We have been in power for seventy years. We will always be in power. It is such a little thing, like swatting a fly. Who will ever know?” Advertisement
Yet millions have known in such circumstances that their identity as free women and free men was at stake; more exactly, their salvation. Irina Ratushinskaya, Raoul Wallenberg, Andrei Sakharov, Maximilian Kolbe, Vladimir Bukovsky, Vaclav Havel, Anatole Scharansky, Pavel Bratinka, Tomas Halik, Mikhailo Mikhailov, Armando Valladares — let us summon up the witnesses, the endless scroll of honor of our century.
To obey truth is to be free, and in extreme circumstances nothing is more clear to the tormented mind, nothing more vital to the survival of self-respect, nothing so important to one’s sense of remaining a worthy human being — of being no one’s cog, part of no one’s machine, and resister to death against the kingdom of lies — nothing is so dear as to hold to truth. In fidelity to truth lies human dignity. Advertisement
There is nothing recondite in this. Simple people have often seen it more clearly than have clerks. This is the plain insight that Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn expressed when he wrote in his Nobel address (1970) that one single truth is more powerful than all the weapons in the world; that, dark as that hour then seemed in the world, with Communism everywhere advancing, truth would prevail against the lie; and that those who clung to truth would overturn tyranny. He was correct in his predictions. Truth did prevail over arms — we are witnesses to history; it is our obligation to teach this to our children.
What those learned who suffered in prison in our time — what Dostoevsky learned in prison in the Tsar’s time — is that we human beings do not own the truth. Truth is not “merely subjective,” not something we make up, or choose, or cut to today’s fashions or the morrow’s pragmatism — we obey the truth. We do not “have” the truth. Truth owns us. Truth is far larger and deeper than we are. Truth leads us where it will. It is not ours for mastering. Advertisement Advertisement
And yet, even in prison, truth is a master before whom a free man stands erect. In obeying the evidence of truth, no human being is humiliated — rather, in that way alone ennobled. In obeying truth, the way of liberty is marked out “as a lamp unto our feet.” In obeying truth, a man becomes aware of his participation in something greater than himself.
Truth is the light of God within us. For us its humble mode is inquiry, seeking, restlessness. Innermost at the core of us, even as children, is an irrepressible drive to ask questions. That unlimited drive is God’s dynamic presence in us, the seed of our dissatisfaction with everything less than infinite. Advertisement
The grand refusal of the modern age to say “yes” to God is a failure both of intellect and of imagination. Modernity’s mistake is to have imagined God as if He were different from truth, alien to ourselves, “out there” like a ghostly object far in space, to serve Whom is to lose our own autonomy. Modernity has imagined God to be a ghostly version of the tyrants we have actually seen in the 20th century.
It took the real tyrants of our time, jackbooted, oily-haired, self-confident, enjoying the torture of innocents, to shatter that false identity. The tyrants may have thought they were like God; it was idiotic to flatter them that God was like them.
In the 20th century, prisons and torture chambers have been better places to encounter God than universities. Many who resisted the tyrants of our era turned nihilism inside out. In the nothingness they found inner light. Many came to call the light they found “God.” The relation some gradually assumed toward this inner light, whose Source, they knew, was not themselves, was that of wordless conversation or communion. They addressed their God in conversation, under the name of Truth.
Two Great Practical Lessons
Until recently, modernity was mistaken in its relation to truth, and thus to God and humankind. But even so modernity has, to its great credit, by grant of Providence, made three great institutional discoveries. Modern thinkers first worked out, as neither the ancients nor the medievals did, the practical principles of the free society: free in its polity, free in its economy, and free in the realm of conscience and inquiry. The great modern achievements in these matters have been supremely practical: how to make free institutions work at least tolerably well, and better in most ways than earlier regimes.
However, despite these happy practical gains, modernity tore down the only philosophical foundations which can sustain the free society. The Enlightenment was supposed to do away with sectarian bickering, but it did not. If you stay within your own school of thought, the foundations of the free society may seem secure. Peek outside, however, and you will hear raucous voices shouting. The age of Enlightenment has failed to secure an intelligent mode of public moral argument that gets beyond the language of the playpen.
Lest we forget: The 20th century was not only the bloodiest, but also the most ideological century. Ideology is the atheist’s substitute for faith; lacking faith, our age did not want for warring ideologies. For nine decades of this century, armies not exactly ignorant clashed by night. Beneath the fearful din, two great practical principles of the free society were mortally contested: first, the political principle; second, the economic principle.
Despite the books and songs of the 1930s — “The End of an Era,” “The Lights are Going Out All Over the World,” “The Decline of the West” — and despite the boast of dictators that “In three weeks England will have her neck wrung like a chicken” — decadent democracies proved they had the will, the audacity, and the stamina to defeat the principle of dictatorship. They defeated it so decisively that today hardly a dictator anywhere in the world, although many (alas) remain, dares to argue that dictatorship is an ideal form of government. Most are left to argue limply that, in the particular case of their own countries, dictatorship is expedient. They lie.
For poor people, the principles of democracy (the rule of law, limited government, checks and balances) are better than dictatorship. Only thus can people enjoy the zone of civil liberty necessary to ensure their dignity and self-command. Political democracy is the world’s first great practical lesson of our time, learned at fearful cost. Advertisement
The second great practical lesson of our century is the futility of socialism as an economic principle. For 150 years, the intellectual battle over fundamental economic principles was conducted asymmetrically. Hundreds of books detailed the wonders of socialism as an ideology, passionately dissected the flaws of capitalist practice, and boastfully mapped out the coming transition from capitalism to socialism. Not one single book existed — when the time finally came — to map out the necessary transition from socialism to capitalism. I doubt whether ever in history so many intellectuals were wrong on a matter to which they themselves assigned highest moment, while considering themselves “scientific.” The story of how this happened must one day be recounted.
As Pope John Paul II recently pointed out in Centesimus Annus, this story is connected to the intellectuals’ devaluation of the human person. No system that devalues the initiative and creativity of every woman and every man, made in the image of their Creator, is fit for human habitation. On the first day that the flag of Russia snapped against the blue sky over the city hall of St. Petersburg, where for seven decades the red flag had flown, a Russian artist told me: “The next time you want to try an experiment like socialism, try it out on animals first — men it hurts too much.”
Indeed, once the Iron Curtain was joyfully torn down, and the great lie thoroughly unmasked, it became clear that in the heartland of “real existing socialism” the poor were living in third-world conditions; that a large majority of the population was in misery; that both the will to work and economic creativity had been suffocated in the crib; that economic intelligence had been blinded by the absurd necessity to set arbitrarily the prices of some 22 million commodities and services; that the omnivorous State had almost wholly swallowed civil society; that the society of “comrades” had in fact driven millions of individuals into thoroughly privatized, untrusting, and alienated inner isolation; that this culture of the lie had been hated by scores of millions; and that the soils of vast stretches of the land and the waters of rivers and lakes had been despoiled.
Three great lessons have been learned from our century, then, even if the cost of learning them was fearful beyond measure. First, truth matters. Second, for all its manifest faults, even absurdities, democracy is better for the protection of individuals and minorities than dictatorship. Third, for all its deficiencies, even gaping inadequacies, capitalism is better for the poor than either of its two great rivals, socialism and the third-world traditional state. Just watch in which direction the poor of the world invariably migrate. The poor — among whom my family in living memory could be counted — know better than the intellectuals. They seek opportunity and liberty. They seek systems that allow them to be economically creative, as God made them to be.
From these three lessons, one might derive reasons for hope: Quite possibly — if along that great plain that runs like an arrow eastward from Germany through Poland, Ukraine, Belarus, and the Russian steppes, the new experiments in democracy and capitalism succeed — the 21st century could be the most prosperous and free in the history of the world.
Perhaps China, too, if it becomes a democracy under the rule of law as it is already becoming capitalist, will bring to its more than 1 billion citizens unprecedented liberty. Throughout Latin America, there is a chance that the fertile soil of liberty will yield new fruits of education, creative energy, and prosperity for all.
The 21st century could be the single most creative century in history, bringing virtually all the peoples of the world under the cool and healthful shade of liberty. It could be lovely.
Far likelier, alas, is the prospect that the 21st century will be like the 20th: tormented, sanguinary, barbarous. For there is still a fourth lesson.

The Ecology of Liberty
During the 20th century, the free society was fighting for its life. The urgent need to secure the free polity and the free economy blinded most to the cultural peril into which liberty has rapidly been falling.
Many sophisticated people love to say that they are cynical, that ours is a cynical age. They flatter themselves. They do not believe nothing; they believe anything. Ours is not an age of unbelief, but of arrogant gullibility. Think how many actually believed the romance of fascism. Think how many plighted their troth to socialism. Think how many, now today, believe in global warming; think how many believe in a coming Ice Age — and think how many believe in both! One thing our intellectual betters never lack is passionate belief.
One principle that many ardent souls of our time most passionately disseminate, for example, is vulgar relativism, “nihilism with a happy face.” For them, it is certain that there is no truth, only opinion: my opinion, your opinion. They abandon the defense of intellect and retreat to the romance of will. There being no purchase of intellect upon reality, nothing else is left but preference, and will becomes everything.
But this is to give to Mussolini and Hitler posthumously, and casually, what they could not vindicate by the most willful force of arms. It is to miss the first great lesson rescued from the ashes of World War II: Those who surrender the domain of intellect make straight the road of fascism. Totalitarianism, as Mussolini defined it, is la feroce volontá. It is the will-to-power, unchecked by any regard for truth. To surrender the claims of truth upon humans is to surrender the earth to thugs. It is to make a mockery of those who endured agonies for truth at the hands of torturers.
This most perilous threat to the free society is neither political nor economic. It is the poisonous, corrupting culture of relativism. Vulgar relativism is an invisible gas, odorless, deadly, that is now polluting every free society on earth. It is a gas that attacks the central nervous system of moral striving. The people know this, while the intellectuals do not. If our intellectual betters knew this, they would be sounding the alarm.
Freedom cannot grow — it cannot even survive — in every atmosphere or clime. In the wearying journey of human history, free societies have been astonishingly rare. The ecology of liberty is more fragile than the biosphere of Earth. Freedom needs clean and healthful habits, sound families, common decencies, and the unafraid respect of one human for another. Freedom needs entire rain forests of little acts of virtue, tangled loyalties, fierce loves, undying commitments. Freedom needs particular institutions and these, in turn, need peoples of particular habits of the heart.
There are two types of liberty: one pre-critical, emotive, whimsical, proper to children; the other critical, sober, deliberate, responsible, and proper to adults. Alexis de Tocqueville called attention to this difference early in Democracy in America, and at Cambridge Lord Acton put it this way: Liberty is not the freedom to do what you wish; it is the freedom to do what you ought. Human beings are the only creatures on earth that do not blindly obey the laws of their nature, by instinct, but are free to choose to obey them with a loving will. Only humans enjoy the liberty to do what we ought to do — or, alas, not to do it.
It is this second kind of liberty — critical, adult liberty — that lies at the living core of the free society. It is the liberty of self-command, a tolerable mastery over one’s own passions, bigotry, ignorance, and self-deceit. It is the liberty of self-government in one’s own personal life. For how, James Madison once asked, can a people incapable of self-government in private life prove capable of it in public? If they cannot practice self-government over their private passions, how will they practice it over the institutions of the republic?
Can there be a free society among citizens who habitually lie, who malinger, who constantly cheat, who do not meet their responsibilities, who cannot be counted on, who shirk difficulties, who flout the law — or who prefer to live as serfs or slaves, content in their dependency, so long as they are fed and entertained?
Freedom requires the exercise of conscience; it requires the practice of those virtues that, as Winston Churchill noted in his wartime speeches to the House of Commons, have long been practiced in the British Isles: dutiful stout arms, ready hearts, courage, courtesy, ingenuity, respect for individual choice, a patient regard for hearing evidence on both sides of the story. Advertisement
During the past 100 years, the question for those who loved liberty was whether, relying on the virtues of our peoples, we could survive the most powerful assaults from without. During the next 100 years, the question for those who love liberty will be whether we can survive the most insidious and duplicitous attacks from within, from those who undermine the virtues of our people, doing in advance the work of the Father of Lies. “There is no such thing as truth,” they teach even the little ones. “Truth is bondage. Believe what seems right to you. There are as many truths as there are individuals. Get in touch with yourself. Do what feels comfortable.”
This is how they speak, those who prepare the jails of the 21st century. Those who undermine the idea of truth do the work of tyrants.
No doubt, you have heard objection to this warning. It goes like this: “To accept the idea of moral truth is to accept authoritarian control.” Pity those who say this! Between moral relativism and political control, there is a third alternative, well known to the common sense of the English-speaking peoples. It is called self-control. We do not want a government that coerces the free consciences of individuals; on the contrary, we want self-governing individuals to restrain immoral government. We want self -government, self -command, self- control.
If a people composed of 100 million citizens is guarded by 100 million inner policemen — that is, by 100 million self-governing consciences — then the number of policemen on its streets may be few. For a society without inner policemen, on the contrary, there aren’t enough policemen in the world to make society civil. Self-control is not authoritarianism; it is the alternative to it.
What Must We Do?
“The Revolution,” Charles Peguy once wrote, “is moral; or not at all.” This is also the law for the free society. It will deepen its moral culture — or it will die. As human lungs need air, so does liberty need virtue. As does this blue-green planet Earth, so has liberty its own ecology. The deepest and most vital struggles of the 21st century will be cultural arguments over the sorts of habits necessary to the preservation of liberty. What are the habits we must teach our young? Which are the habits we must encourage in ourselves, and which discourage? To allow liberty to survive — and, more than that, to make it worth all the blood and tears expended to achieve it –how do we need to live?
With the ample wealth produced by a free economy, with private liberties bestowed abundantly by free polities, are we not now ashamed of the culture we have wrought, of its shocking crimes, its loss of virtue, its loss of courtesy, the decline of common decency?
Can all the sufferings of our ancestors on behalf of liberty have been endured for this — that we might be as we now are? Nihilism builds no cities. Great cultures are built by vaulting aspiration — by the eros of truth and love and justice and realism.
We must learn again how to teach the virtues of the noble Greeks and Romans; the commandments God entrusted to the Hebrews; the virtues that Jesus introduced into the world — even into secular consciences — such as gentleness, kindness, compassion, and the equality of all in our Father’s love. We must celebrate again the heroes, great and humble, who have for centuries exemplified the virtues proper to our individual peoples. We must learn again how to speak of virtue, character, and nobility of soul.
Liberty itself requires unprecedented virtues, rarely seen in simpler and more simply led societies. Special virtues are needed by self-governing peoples: calm, deliberate, dispassionate reflection ; careful, responsible, consequence-accepting choice. In self-government, citizens are sovereigns, and must learn to exercise the virtues of sovereigns.
The free economy, too, demands more virtues than the socialist or third-world traditional economies: It demands active persons, self-starters, women and men of enterprise and risk. It requires the willingness to sacrifice present pleasures for rewards that will be enjoyed primarily by future generations. It requires vision, discovery, invention. Its dynamism is human creativity endowed in us by our Creator, Who made us in His image. Advertisement
And so, too, the pluralist society calls for higher levels of civility, tolerance, and reasoned public argument than citizens in simpler times ever needed."
Mueller Investigation: Pious Hypocrisy | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Victor Davis Hanson,04-25-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/mueller-investigation-pious-hypocrisy/,"April 25, 2019 6:30 AM Robert Mueller on Capitol Hill in 2013. (Larry Downing/Reuters) Mueller’s team went down every blind alley relating to its investigation -- except where Obama-era officials were likely culpable for relevant unethical or illegal behavior.
S pecial counsel Robert Mueller’s two-year, $30 million, 448-page report did not find collusion between Donald Trump and Russia.
Despite compiling private allegations of loud and obnoxious Trump behavior, Mueller also concluded that there was not any actionable case of obstruction of justice by the president. It would have been hard in any case to find that Trump obstructed Mueller’s investigation of an alleged crime. Advertisement Advertisement
One, there was never a crime of collusion. Mueller early on in his endeavors must have realized that truth, but he pressed ahead anyway. It is almost impossible to prove obstruction of nothing.
Two, Trump cooperated with the investigation. He waived executive privilege. He turned over more than 1 million pages of administrative documents. He allowed then–White House counsel Don McGahn to submit to over 30 hours of questioning by Mueller’s lawyers.
Three, anyone targeted by a massive investigation who knows he is innocent of an alleged crime is bound to become frustrated over a seemingly never-ending inquisition. Advertisement
Trump’s reported periodic rages at the Mueller investigation are regrettable but not unnatural, given that Mueller expended a huge amount of government resources to confirm what many knew at the outset: that there was never any collusion with the Russian government to warp the 2016 election.
Yet Mueller’s team went down every blind alley relating to its investigation — except where Obama-era officials were likely culpable for relevant unethical or illegal behavior. Advertisement
The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrants were integral to Mueller’s investigations. But there is no mention of how the FISA court was deceived by not being told that the chief evidence used to obtain the warrants was an unverified dossier paid for in part by the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee.
Some of the collusion narrative Mueller examined was based on FBI informants’ unverified stories. Yet strangely, the Mueller team did not investigate whether it was legal in the first place for the FBI, possibly with CIA help, to use informants to spy on a presidential campaign. Advertisement
Former FBI director James Comey figures into the Mueller report. But there is no curiosity about whether he broke the law in leaking what may well have been four classified memos of private presidential conversations to the press for the purpose of forcing an appointment of a special counsel.
The Christopher Steele dossier likewise makes an appearance in the Mueller report. But for a team investigating the alleged collusion of foreigners in a U.S. election, there is silence about the salient fact that Steele, a foreign national, enlisted other foreign nationals to dig up dirt on Trump to weaken his election chances — with part of the funding for this research provided by the Clinton campaign and the DNC. Advertisement
What bothers many Americans about the collusion hoax is the accompanying sanctimony of the so-called investigators. The Mueller team could have helped itself had it just noted that much of the evidence it looked at was a product of Obama-era officials’ unethical or illegal behavior.
Comey wrote a memoir, A Higher Loyalty . Its eponymous themes are Comey’s own ethics and principles. But Comey may well have misled the FISA court and possibly lied under oath to a House committee. He was not candid with federal investigators and leaked confidential and classified government memos.
Former FBI director Andrew McCabe also wrote a memoir, The Threat . Its argument is that FBI kingpins such as McCabe protect America from dangers such as Donald Trump. But McCabe himself is under criminal referral for lying to federal investigators. His sworn congressional testimony cannot be reconciled with Comey’s. McCabe also likely misled the FISA court. And he apparently contemplated staging a near-coup to remove an elected president through the deliberate misuse of the 25th Amendment. Advertisement
Former CIA director John Brennan is a paid analyst for MSNBC who often railed about Trump’s “treason” and predicted his indictment. Yet Brennan himself has lied under oath to Congress on two occasions. He likely misled Congress about his role in trafficking in the Steele dossiers. And Brennan’s CIA may well have helped the FBI use informants abroad to entrap Trump campaign aides in efforts to find dirt on Trump.
Former director of National Intelligence James Clapper is a CNN analyst who often predicted that a supposedly treasonous Trump would be indicted. Clapper, too, has lied to Congress under oath. He once denied and then admitted to leaking confidential documents.
The problem with the Mueller investigation, and with former intelligence officials such as Brennan, Clapper, Comey, and McCabe, is pious hypocrisy. Those who have lectured America on Trump’s unproven crimes have written books and appeared on TV to publicize their own superior virtue. Yet they themselves have engaged in all sorts of unethical and illegal behavior. Advertisement"
California's State of the Air Report: Regulation Has Limits | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Jim Geraghty,04-25-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/californias-skies-and-the-limits-of-regulation/,"April 25, 2019 10:13 AM Century City and downtown Los Angeles, Calif. (Lucy Nicholson/Reuters)
The American Lung Association’s annual “ State of the Air ” report offers a valuable lesson about the limits of regulation to solve problems.
California has the toughest air-quality regulations of any state in the country. In 1967, the state passed sweeping new regulations in response to Los Angeles’ smog, and under the Clean Air Act, the state was allowed to keep it stricter standards. All of its recent governors considered themselves environmentalists, and no doubt the state’s legislators consider themselves to be defenders of clean air. California New Car Dealers Association says 4.7 percent of the cars sold in the state in the past year are now all-electric and plug-in hybrids are another 3.1 percent. Advertisement Advertisement
Yet the State of the Air report finds that by every measure — ozone, year-round particle pollution, and short-term particle pollution — California cities are at the top of the list and often dominate the top ten. Los Angeles, Visalia, Bakersfield, Fresno, Sacramento, and San Diego are the top six for worst in ozone; Fresno and Bakersfield rank one and two for worst in year-round particle pollution and three California cities in the top six; and the same two are the two worst in short-term particle pollution, with four California cities in the top seven.
This is not some sort of Trump administration-driven change; the report covers air quality from 2015 to 2017. Advertisement
If California has such strict regulation, why is the air quality so bad? Blame it on geography and population density — two factors that are exceptionally difficult to change. The American Lung Association has done 20 State of the Air reports and Los Angeles ranked as the worst in 19 of those years. California’s cities have a lot of people, a lot of cars and traffic, and a lot of sunny days. When you live in a valley surrounded by high mountains, the smog doesn’t disperse easily. And there are other factors that are not easily mitigated through regulations: “Twenty of the 26 most polluted cities had more days on average in the 2019 report. Many of these are due to wildfires.” Advertisement"

It’s usually the Social Justice Warrior students who hound professors for saying politically incorrect things, but sometimes faculty colleagues play that role. In today’s Martin Center article , I write about a really nasty case at the University of Louisville where that occurred.
Dr. Allan Josephson has been in medical practice since 1976 and after two other university medical-school appointments, he was tabbed in 2003 to become chief of Louisville Medical School’s Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Psychology. He performed exceptionally well in that role. Advertisement Advertisement
But Dr. Josephson is not in agreement with the current “ progressive ” thinking about dealing with gender dysphoria and said so on a panel at a Heritage Foundation event in 2017. For his deviationism, the medical school came down on him like a ton of bricks. He was demoted, his budget slashed, and he was assigned as much work as a junior faculty member. His efforts at calming the waters were unavailing. For saying wrong things about gender dysphoria, he’d become persona non grata."

As he threw his hat into the ring for the Democratic presidential nomination Thursday, former vice president Joe Biden was asked whether President Barack Obama, his former running mate, would endorse his candidacy.
“I asked President Obama not to endorse and he doesn’t want to,” Biden explained to reporters in Delaware. “Whoever wins this nomination should win this on their own merits.”
Nevertheless, Obama issued a glowing statement in the wake of Biden’s campaign launch.
“President Obama has long said that selecting Joe Biden as his running mate in 2008 was one of the best decisions he ever made,” said Obama spokeswoman Katie Hill. “He relied on the vice president’s knowledge, insight, and judgment throughout both campaigns and the entire presidency. The two forged a special bond over the last ten years and remain close today.” Stay Updated with NR Daily

Of course, the former vice president has a much less cozy relationship with President Trump, whom he attacked by name in his announcement video.
“If we give Donald Trump eight years in the White House, he will forever and fundamentally alter the character of this nation, who we are. And I cannot stand by and watch that happen,” Biden said. “The core values of this nation, our standing in the world, our very democracy, everything that has made America America’s at stake.”"

Once a thriving regional university with a strong reputation for the liberal arts, the University of Tulsa is in deep trouble these days. Professor Jacob Howland explains the school’s sad decline in this City Journal essay .
Part of the difficulty is the money the university’s previous administration squandered on athletics, but the real malignancy is the new president’s vision, which Howland describes as turning Tulsa “ into a glorified trade school with a social justice agenda. ” Advertisement Advertisement
The liberal arts are being pushed aside in favor of recruiting first-generation students and offering them occupational training programs — but as Howland observes, few such students could possibly afford the tuition. Leftist ideology is seeping into every corner of the university: a Diversity Action Plan, mandatory training to combat “ unconscious bias, ” and other progressive goodies. A revealing instance of the mindset in control of Tulsa is that during the Kavanaugh hearings, President Gerard Clancy felt the need to send around a campus-wide letter to comfort students, telling them that they need not worry about their “ safety and acceptance ” at the university."
Franklin Graham & Lost Evangelical Witness: Transactional Approach to Politics Hurts Church | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,David French,04-25-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/franklin-graham-and-the-high-cost-of-the-lost-evangelical-witness/,"Follow David French on Twitter April 25, 2019 2:25 PM President Trump listens to Franklin Graham during a ceremony for the late Rev. Billy Graham in the U.S. Capitol Rotunda in Washington, D.C., February 28, 2018. (Jonathan Ernst/Reuters) Graham’s willingness to abandon Christian principles when it’s politically expedient has cost the church dearly.
I t’s hard to think of a single prominent American Christian who better illustrates the collapsing Evangelical public witness than Franklin Graham, Billy Graham’s son. His commitment to the Christian character of American public officials seems to depend largely on their partisan political identity.
Let’s look at the record. In 1998, at the height of Bill Clinton’s sex scandals, the younger Graham wrote a powerful op-ed in the Wall Street Journal combating Clinton’s assertion that his affair was a “private” matter. Clinton argued that his misdeeds were “between me, the two people I love the most — my wife and our daughter — and our God.” Graham noted that even the most private of sins can have very public, devastating consequences, and he asked a simple question: “If [Clinton] will lie to or mislead his wife and daughter, those with whom he is most intimate, what will prevent him from doing the same to the American public?” Advertisement Advertisement
Graham was right: Clinton, it turned out, wouldn’t just lie to mislead his family. He’d lie to influence courts, Congress, and the American people.
Fast-forward 20 years. By 2018, Donald Trump was president — and helping to win important policy victories for religious conservatives — and Graham’s tune had changed dramatically. He actively repudiated his condemnations of Clinton , calling the Republican pursuit of the then-president “a great mistake that should never have happened,” and argued that “this thing with Stormy Daniels and so forth is nobody’s business.”
Graham was wrong: Trump, it turns out, doesn’t just lie to mislead his family. He lies all the time to influence courts, Congress, and the American people. Advertisement Advertisement
So is this the “new normal” for Evangelicals? Is politics entirely transactional now? Do we evaluate politicians only on their policies and leave the sex discussions to the privacy of their own bedrooms?
Apparently not, according to . . . Franklin Graham. Now that the Democratic primary is gaining steam and a gay candidate is surging forward, Graham has rediscovered his moral voice. Yesterday he tweeted this: Mayor Buttigieg says he’s a gay Christian. As a Christian I believe the Bible which defines homosexuality as sin, something to be repentant of, not something to be flaunted, praised or politicized. The Bible says marriage is between a man & a woman—not two men, not two women. 2/3
— Franklin Graham (@Franklin_Graham) April 24, 2019
Yes, marriage is the union between a man and a woman, but Trump married a woman, then married his mistress, then married a third woman, then had an affair with a porn star while that third wife was pregnant with his child. Yet Graham says, “God put him” in the presidency and we need to “get behind him and support him.”
The proper Evangelical position toward any president is not hard to articulate, though it is exceedingly difficult to hold to, especially in polarized times when one party seems set on limiting religious liberty and zealously defending abortion: We should pray for presidents, critique them when they’re wrong, praise them when they’re right, and never, ever impose partisan double standards. We can’t ever forget the importance of character, the necessity of our own integrity, and the power of the prophetic witness. Advertisement
In other words, Evangelicals can never take a purely transactional approach to politics. We are never divorced from our transcendent purpose, which always trumps political expediency. In scripture, prophets confronted leaders about their sin. They understood a core truth, one clearly articulated in the Southern Baptist Convention’s 1998 Resolution on Moral Character of Public Officials : “Tolerance of serious wrong by leaders sears the conscience of the culture, spawns unrestrained immorality and lawlessness in the society, and surely results in God’s judgment.” Advertisement
All too many of our nation’s Evangelical leaders haven’t just “tolerated” serious wrongdoing by Trump, they’ve rationalized and minimized it. Some have even given the “thumbs up” in front of a Playboy cover . (What would Nathan, who dramatically confronted David over his infidelity and murder, say?) In so doing, they’ve seared the consciences of the culture and the church, and granted their secular opponents all the ammunition necessary to question our sincerity as believers. Advertisement"
