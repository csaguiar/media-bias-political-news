I had to pledge allegiance to Elizabeth, Queen of New Zealand. Although the Crown of NZ is embodied in the same human being as the Crown of the UK, the nature of the relationship is different. I realised as I was pledging that the Queen of NZ is still our constitutional monarch, represented by our Governor General. However, in the UK, she is merely a citizen of the EU, to all intents and purposes mediatised, with the same status as an Indian maharajah during the days of the Raj. Her mediatisation was very well symbolised by her choice of headwear at the last state opening of the Westminster parliament."

In theory the only real power the Crown holds is that as guardian against a ""Fascist"" or Rogue Parliament, is when as Dicey explains ""the opinion of the House is not the opinion of the electors"" the Crown's sacred duty is to step in and prevent Parliament as Dictator acting in an undemocratic fashion.
When I was taught this in school, my Politics teacher laughed, saying something along the lines ""This would never happen, this is Britain and our Parliament would not give rise to a Hitler""
Yet here we are, a Parliament clearly wishing to dictate to the electors.
Of course the majority of Brits would applaud her taking this action, but it would also lead to Antifa types rioting in the streets, to hardening of Republican voices in Parliament calling for an end to the Monarchy.
At the same time among the majority support for the Monarchy would harden, but it would be polarizing.
The Crown will wait for all legal and political avenues to be exhausted before acting - publicly."

It does not jibe with us kicking such out of North America back in 1776. That being as it may, I have always had great respect for Queen Elizabeth. For a couple of years, while my family lived in Canada, I was technically her subject (or at least under her protection). My first awareness of her was a beautiful portrait in the lobby of the Palliser Hotel in Calgary. Anyone who has been in Calgary knows what a wonderful place the hotel is.
I do get the whole attempt at a ""constitutional monarchy"". Let the people vote for their leaders, rather than have someone running the show, just because they were born in the right castle. But I don't see why, even under this structure, the Monarch has to be stripped of all political powers. Without such, how can she act as the final safeguard for the country.
The Royal powers have been slowly stripped away by the same political class that is now determined to enslave the UK to their traditional enemies on the Continent. The Queen needs to act with the limited power she has and also employ what Theodore Roosevelt called the ""bully pulpit"".
I know there is a never ending debate about whether the Monarchy should be kept. For what the opinion of a Yank counts, I have always thought it needed to be maintained because it helped the British people to remember where they came from and the courage and fortitude it took to built a great civilization. But if the Queen does not act, that debate is over, and the Windsors can figure out how to put food on the table without slopping off the public trough."

Absolutely incorrect.
The fixed Term Parliament Act, a dirty and nasty piece of legislation prompted by the eu, was the product of camoron and clegg.
""The Fixed-Term Parliaments Act 2011 specifically revoked the
Royal Prerogative to dissolve Parliament. It even repealed the Septenniel Act 1715, which empowered the Sovereign to limit the term of any Parliament to a maximum of 7 years (later amended to 5). The Queen now only retains the right of 'prorogation' (i.e. terminating the current session of Parliament, and suspending proceedings until the next session), but even this, by Convention,
is only exercised on the advice of the Prime Minster.
There is no specific Crown Prerogative to demand the resignation of an incumbent Prime Minister without the dissolution of Parliament, which as stated is no longer within the Sovereign's remit. The
Queen could probably suggest resignation under her Conventional right to 'caution and advise', but she has no authority to insist upon it.
Parliament can currently only be dissolved in two ways;
viz:-
1. A resolution of 'No Confidence in Her Majesty's
Government', passed by simple Parliamentary majority (and provided no second resolution expressing confidence in the government is passed within 14 days);
or
2. If two-thirds of the Members of the House of Commons
resolve that there shall be an early general election.

Report on Iran Missile Development AP/Ebrahim Noroozi BREITBART JERUSALEM 3 Apr 2019 (AFP) UNITED NATIONS — Britain, France and Germany accused Iran of developing missile technology in contravention of a UN resolution, and called for a full UN report on recent activities, according to a letter released Tuesday. The European trio cited Iran’s launch of a space vehicle and the unveiling of two new ballistic missiles in February as forming “part of trend of increased activity inconsistent” with the resolution, according to the letter sent to UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres.
UN Security Council Resolution 2231 — adopted just after the 2015 nuclear deal — calls on Iran, but does not require of it, “not to undertake any activity related to ballistic missiles designed to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons.”
Tehran insists that its missile program is defensive and that it has no intention of developing a nuclear capability.
The three countries asked Guterres to “report fully and thoroughly on Iranian ballistic missile activity” in his next report, which is expected in June.
The letter from the European countries, which are signatories to the nuclear deal along with the United States and Russia, came nearly a month after the United States made a similar appeal to the council, saying it was time to bring back tougher international restrictions on Tehran.
US President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of the nuclear accord in May last year and reimposed sanctions on Iran, citing concerns about missile development among its reasons.
At a council meeting in December, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called for tighter restrictions on Iran to curb its missile program but Russia flatly asserted that there was no proof that Iran’s missiles can carry a nuclear payload.
The European countries said the Safir space launch vehicle used for a satellite blastoff on February 6 is based on two other missiles and uses technology closely related to the development of long-range and intercontinental ballistic missiles.
On February 7, the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guards unveiled the Dezful surface-to-surface missile which they claimed had a range of 1,000 kilometers, according to the letter sent on March 25.
During a public display in Tehran on February 4, Iran revealed a variant of the Khorramshahr ballistic missile that the letter said was “potentially an intermediate-range ballistic missile.”
Iran reined in most of its nuclear program under the nuclear deal with major powers but has kept up development of its ballistic missile technology.

I jokingly said that Citizens of Great Britain could not answer a call to Arms because they permitted their government to confiscate them.
I do not believe that anyone in GB will be going to war with a well registered pump action shotgun and a bolt or lever action rifle.
Air guns are even restricted over there as is tear gas and pepper spray. Ammunition is really restricted, you have to really be a genius to understand all the restrictions, certifications and penalties involved in the owning of a gun.
You know there are a lot of gun deaths over here but half of the reported gun deaths are suicides, and of the other half 50 or 60% are just one criminal killing another or a good guy killing a bad guy. A very small percentage are innocent people being shot by armed gunmen.
I say you surrendered your guns to the govt. because you had guns and did not use them to assure that you could keep them. Do you think the govt. here believes that they can ever take our guns? There have been some pretty horrible mass shootings here but we have not allowed our government to use these horrible crimes as a reason to disarm us and we never will.
All my sons received a semiautomatic AR-15 rifle, a pump action Shot gun and a 9mm, 17 shot pistol for their 12 th birthdays and they could already use them proficiently when they received them.
