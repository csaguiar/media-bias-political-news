Anyone can read a book and pass a test, it is applying the knowledge that makes the differance... Considering you completely missed what I said it makes your whole comment just useless babble... ""Those of us who spent three years in law school, did well, passed the bar, then practiced for over three decades have a different definition of criminal conspiracy"" I NEVER called it ""criminal conspiracy"" or conspiracy at all... I called it collusion, and even stated that collusion is not a crime, ""it is a secret agreement / understanding between 2 or more people""... People collude when they plan a surprise party for someone else ""in secret""... Trump's lawyers sent a letter to the special prosecutor in Jan of 2018 where they admitted that Trump lied about ""the meeting"" to keep the ""real truth about dirt a secret""... That makes Trump himself colluding with everyone in that meeting (including the Russian's there were in the meeting) to lie to keep it secret... BUT as I posted that, you seemed to miss / not comprehend... Collusion is not a crime, and since the meeting turned out to be a flop, that could be why Mueller ignored the ""collusion"" issue, or since he din't find grounds for consiracy, he just ignored it altogether... THAT is what I have posted between both my comments, and all over the internet, and have always said collusion is not a crime since all this started... BUT I also always point out that it did happen and was admitted to... Of course that is where ignorance, either natural or ""by choiice"" comes in with all the people who start arguing with me... Collusion with Russian's happened and was admitted to by Senior Trump Campaign personnell and Trump himself, that is what I have constantly said, and even posted several links when asked in the past... But I have also always said ""collusion"" is not a crime... So where / how you can spin that into me supposeddly claiming it is ""criminal conspiracy"" seems to be ""you"" as the one lacking education / comprehension or the one that is pushing for that possibility, not me..."
