But when the frontrunner, Bernie Sanders, says anything that could be described as ...'encapsulating the hopes and dreams of the electorate' or '...evoking themes that prove irresistible to liberals (generational change, a we-can-do-better scolding of a neglectful Republican stewardship, the need for national unity)' he is said to be vague and promising too much without being able to deliver (politispeak for: we like to talk about change, but don't actually want substantial change for the working poor). Perhaps, according to the author, Bernie is not 'vague enough not to alienate moderates who might be fearful of overreach.' So if you are some yound rich kid, you can AND SHOULD bullshit your way to the presidency with platitudes and mixed messaging that sounds good, but doesn't equate to anything real. But,if you are a life-long politician fighting for working class rights and dignity, with policies and agendas that would help those people you are just a 'rumpled-professor.' Nice."
