About as likely as me marrying a supermodel, BEFORE hitting the Powerball for 9 or 10 figures!!!.
Make no mistake, this is just more pandering to those who use bogus excuses for failures within the Black community, or their own failures (compared to other minorities), such as the concept of ""institutional racism"".
I hope the POTUS really starts the pushback on the idea of his failures towards the AA community, which is ludicrous on the face of it.
I would ask these Dem. candidates ""Who has done more for the AA community, and where are your facts to prove it""?"

GENEVA - Iran will take reciprocal action against the United States if Washington designates the elite Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) as terrorists, a majority of Iranian parliamentarians said on Sunday, according to state news agency IRNA.The United States is expected to designate the Revolutionary Guards a foreign terrorist organization, three US officials told Reuters, marking the first time Washington has formally labeled another country’s military a terrorist group. ""We will answer any action taken against this force with a reciprocal action,"" a statement issued by 255 out of the 290 Iranian lawmakers said, according to IRNA.""So the leaders of America, who themselves are the creators and supporters of terrorists in the (Middle East) region, will regret this inappropriate and idiotic action.""The US decision, which critics warn could open US military and intelligence officials to similar actions by unfriendly governments abroad, is expected to be announced by the State Department perhaps as early as Monday, the US officials said last week. The move has been rumored for years.Iran's foreign minister said on Sunday US officials aiming to designate the IRGC as terrorist wanted to ""drag the US into a quagmire"" on behalf of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.""#NetanyahuFirsters who have long agitated for FTO (Foreign Terrorist Organisation) of the IRGC fully understand its consequences for US forces in the region.

Iran denies this.IRGC commander Mohammad Ali Jafari also chimed in on Sunday over the pending US designation, warning the US military would lose all the security it enjoyed in west Asia.""With this stupidity, the American army and security forces will no longer have today's calm in the west Asia region,"" Jafari was quoted as saying by semi-official Fars news agency.Set up after the 1979 Islamic Revolution to protect the Shi'ite clerical ruling system, the IRGC is Iran's most powerful security organization. It controls large sectors of the Iranian economy and has huge influence in its political system.

Amateur Hovland to make history for Norway at the Masters,www.freemalaysiatoday.com,Reuters,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/sports/2019/04/07/amateur-hovland-to-make-history-for-norway-at-the-masters/,"Amateur Hovland to make history for Norway at the Masters By April 7, 2019 9:52 PM (Facebook pic)
NORTH CAROLINA: It speaks to Viktor Hovland’s youth that his first vivid memory of watching the Masters was as recently as 2013, when Adam Scott became the first Australian to win a Green Jacket.
Six years later, the 21-year-old Hovland will be a trailblazer for his country when he becomes the first player from Norway to compete at Augusta National.
He will tee up on Thursday as part of a six-strong amateur contingent that also includes Ernie Els’ nephew South African Jovan Rebula, the British Amateur champion.
Hovland earned a trip to this year’s Masters – and the US and British Open events – by winning the US Amateur championship in dominant fashion at Pebble Beach last year.
He tied the record for the fewest match play holes needed by a champion since the event went to its current format in 1979, and closed out in style with a 6&5 victory in the final.
Hovland is not planning simply to make up the numbers at Augusta, his lofty ambitions fortified by his decent showing against the pros at last month’s Arnold Palmer Invitational, where he tied for 40th.
“Frankly, I didn’t feel like I played that well, yet I was able to finish 40th with a game that was average, or below average,” he said in a telephone interview with Reuters.
“It definitely gave me some confidence I can hang (with the pros but) you still need to play well.”
Hovland comes from a nation whose men’s golf history is almost non-existent.
While Scandinavian neighbour Sweden has had a production line churning out world-class players for the past three decades, the pickings from Norway have been slim, apart from Suzann Pettersen, a 15-times winner on the LPGA Tour.
American connection
Hovland might never have played golf if not for an American family connection. His father Harald, an engineer, took up the game while living in the United States and passed on his love of the sport to his son.
“He lived in St Louis for one year,” said Hovland, a member of the golf team at Oklahoma State University.
By age 11, Hovland was hooked. He decided he wanted to play the game all year round, even if it meant spending the winter at an indoor driving range.
“You can’t play outside (in Norway) for a big chunk of the year (and until then) I would always take a hiatus during those months,” he said.
“I really wasn’t all that good a junior golfer. I had potential but I was never the star growing up. I never really won anything.”
He nevertheless was good enough to play in the European Boys’ Championship, where he came to the attention of American collegiate scouts, which is how he ended up at Oklahoma State.
Hovland makes no secret of his plan to turn pro sooner rather than later, perhaps as early as this summer.
The Norwegian is a man in a hurry but at the same time he knows from conversations with the likes of Justin Rose and Henrik Stenson that a golfer’s body of work is measured over decades rather than months.
“They say this is a game you can do for a long time,” he said. “Even though I’m in a spot where I’ve got a lot of opportunities, it’s not a sprint, it’s a marathon.” "

(AFP pic)
As “Game of Thrones” starts its eighth and final season on April 14, AFP looks back on its record-breaking run.
Massive ratings
First broadcast in 2011 on the US cable channel HBO, “Game of Thrones” – or GoT to its fans – was not an overnight phenomenon. But its audiences have never stopped growing and by 2014 it had overtaken HBO’s flagship hit, “The Sopranos”.
By its seventh season in 2017, viewing figures were stratospheric. Its final episode set an all-time US record for premium cable TV with 16.5 million people watching live or streaming on the day of transmission and 15 million more tuning in later.
Viewing records also tumbled in many of the 186 countries in which it was shown, with Britain’s Sky Atlantic and OCS in France showing episodes in the middle of the night in sync with their US premieres.
But the figures become truly mind-boggling when illegal downloading is taken into account, with more than one billion people watching pirated copies of the seventh season.
Colossal budgets
The eighth run-out for “Game of Thrones” is reportedly the most expensive season of TV ever shot, with a budget of US$15 million (13 million euros) per episode, taking the overall season cost to US$90 million.
Although much of this has gone on lavish locations and special effects, the final two episodes will be one hour 20 minutes long – almost the length of Hollywood movies.
HBO knows there is little danger of them not getting their money back, with the franchise so far earning them more than US$1 billion, according to the New York Times.
The massive investment has also brought the series a record-breaking trove of 47 Emmy Awards from 128 nominations.
Top secret
After the leak of four episodes of season five before it was broadcast, the producers massively overhauled their security.
To throw hackers and pirates off the scent, showrunners David Benioff and DB Weiss have shot several versions of the final episode, a tactic already used for “The Sopranos” and “Breaking Bad”.
Actress Sophie Turner, who plays Sansa Stark, admitted that even she had been fooled into believing a red herring version of the denouement.
To make sure no one was snooping, the producers took measures to stop drones overflying their shoots.
Game of tourists
The series has also been a boon for tourism, particularly in Northern Ireland, where much of the series was shot, with fans flooding in to visit locations in the region which had previously been best known for its violent sectarian past.
Iceland and the Spanish cities of Girona in the Catalan north and Osuna near Seville have seen their visitor numbers rocket from special “Game of Thrones” tours.
But the Croatian coastal city of Dubrovnik, the setting for King’s Landing, discovered you can have too much of a good thing. It has had to put limits on the number of visitors it can receive in its picturesque medieval centre.
Dothraki baby names
Dogs, goldfish and lots of babies have also been named after characters from the series, with Arya – together with its alternative spelling Aria – entering the top 20 most popular names for girls in Britain last year.
Khaleesi, the honorary title in the imaginary Dothraki language given to Daenerys Targaryen, has also become popular, with 466 little girls in the US and 77 in France named after the queen of dragons last year.
The series has been something of a mixed blessing for pets too. Peter Dinklage, who plays “the Imp” Tyrion Lannister, had to appeal to fans to stop buying Siberian husky dogs who look similar to the dire wolves in the show.
Animal rights campaigners had complained that the number of huskies abandoned in Britain has risen seven-fold since the show started.
Presidential fans
While he was still in the White House, Barack Obama admitted to being a big fan of the series. He even asked HBO to bend their strict rules to allow him a sneak preview of the sixth season.
His successor in the Oval Office Donald Trump has made wide use of the “Winter is coming” motto of the House of Stark.
Much to the irritation of the channel and several of its actors, the US president has adopted the line several times in his tweets, including about Iran – “sanctions are coming” – and his border wall with Mexico: “The wall is coming.”
The president, however, does not appear to have learned the lesson of the “Game of Thrones” wall, which has proved utterly ineffective against illegal immigration of Wildlings and zombie White Walkers. "
Compromise? Time ticking down for Britain to come to Brexit agreement,www.freemalaysiatoday.com,Reuters,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/world/2019/04/07/compromise-time-ticking-down-for-britain-to-come-to-brexit-agreement/,"Compromise? Time ticking down for Britain to come to Brexit agreement By - April 7, 2019 9:25 PM Britain’s Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at church, as Brexit turmoil continues, near High Wycombe, Britain on April 7, 2019. (Reuters pic)
LONDON: Britain’s government held out the possibility of compromise on Sunday with the opposition Labour Party to try to win support in parliament for leaving the European Union with a deal, just days before the latest Brexit date.
Prime Minister Theresa May, weaker than ever after her Brexit deal was rejected by parliament three times, has been forced to turn to Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn after giving up on winning over eurosceptics in her Conservative Party, whose opposition has hardened.
With Britain’s departure now set for April 12, May’s government is running out of time to get a deal through Britain’s divided parliament, and must come up with a new plan to secure a new delay from EU leaders at a summit on Wednesday.
Britain’s biggest shift in foreign and trade policy in more than 40 years is mired in uncertainty, with ministers saying Brexit may never happen, businesses worried the country could leave without a deal, and others just wanting to reverse it.
In a last-ditch bid to get her deal through parliament, May opened talks with Corbyn last week to try to strike a deal on Britain’s future ties with the EU in exchange for his support for her divorce deal, the Withdrawal Agreement.
So far those talks have failed to yield any kind of accord, with Labour policy chiefs saying the government has yet to move from its “red lines”, above all over a customs union, which sets tariffs for goods imported into the EU.
“Specifically provided we are leaving the European Union then it is important that we compromise, that’s what this is about and it is through gritted teeth,” said Andrea Leadsom, the Brexit-supporting leader of the House of Commons (lower house of parliament).
“But nevertheless the most important thing is to actually leave the EU,” she told the BBC’s Andrew Marr show, adding that May’s proposal for a customs arrangement after Brexit was not too far from Labour’s desire for a customs union.
But, while describing the talks so far as positive, Labour’s business policy chief Rebecca Long-Bailey said there had as yet been no “real changes” to the deal.
“I think both sides are committed to working quite rigorously to compromise as much as possible so that we can provide that compromise Brexit deal that I think parliament desperately needs at the moment,” she told the BBC.
Shami Chakrabarti, Labour’s legal policy chief, was more blunt. “It’s hard to imagine that we are going to make real progress now without either a general election or a second referendum on any deal she can get over the line in parliament,” she told Sky News.
Running out of time
Britain voted by 52 to 48% in 2016 to leave the EU, and parliament, May’s cabinet and the country at large remain deeply polarised over the terms of Brexit and even whether to depart at all.
Despite the lack of convergence between the two major parties over a deal, there was one thing they did agree on – time is running out for Brexit to be secured.
May, who has been verbally mauled by members of her own party for turning to Labour, herself warned Brexit-supporting lawmakers that “the longer this takes, the greater the risk of the UK never leaving at all”.
In an attempt to avoid falling out of the EU without a deal, she again heads to Brussels this week to ask for a further delay until June 30 – something EU leaders have said requires her setting out an alternative path to getting her deal approved.
Any extension would require unanimous approval from the other EU countries, all weary of Britain’s Brexit indecision, and could come with conditions. EU summit chair Donald Tusk plans to propose an extension of a year, which could be shortened if Britain’s parliament eventually ratifies the deal.
But even the threat of losing Brexit has so far failed to change the minds of hardline eurosceptic Conservative lawmakers, and some are now suggesting that Britain make the EU’s life a misery if Britain is forced to accept a long delay.
“If we are forced to remain in we must be the most difficult member possible,” Jacob Rees-Mogg, leader of the European Research Group, a Conservative eurosceptic group, told Sky News.
“When the multi-annual financial framework comes forward, if we’re still in, this is our one in seven-year opportunity to veto the budget and to be really very difficult.” "
Football League ‘angered’ by alleged racist abuse,www.freemalaysiatoday.com,Reuters,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/sports/2019/04/07/football-league-angered-by-alleged-racist-abuse/,"Football League ‘angered’ by alleged racist abuse By April 7, 2019 9:20 PM (Reuters pic)
LONDON: Angry English Football League chiefs have condemned a fresh outburst of alleged racism in several matches this weekend.
Championship side Brentford confirmed a season-ticket holder was arrested following a claim of abuse by Derby midfielder Duane Holmes in Saturday’s 3-3 draw at Griffin Park.
Wigan, also in the second tier, have reported a sickening message was sent to wing-back Nathan Byrne on social media to the police.
Meanwhile, Northampton have also revealed that several of their players were allegedly abused ahead of their game at Notts County as they went on a pre-match walk from the team hotel before the League Two game at Meadow Lane.
The incidents come hot on the heels of the racist abuse that had already tarnished this season across Europe.
Montenegro fans marred England’s Euro 2020 qualifier recently by abusing Danny Rose, Raheem Sterling and Callum Hudson-Odoi.
Manchester City winger Sterling was also the victim of alleged racist abuse in a Premier League match at Chelsea in December.
Arsenal’s Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang had a banana skin thrown at him by a Tottenham support.
“The EFL was saddened, disappointed and angered to hear of further reports of alleged racism following the conclusion of some matches on Saturday afternoon,” the statement read.
“It was exceptionally disappointing that this happened as clubs up and down the country were raising awareness of such issues as part of Kick it Out’s Week of Action.
“We remain fully committed to continuing to work alongside The FA and Premier League as well as other relevant parties to ensure that football provides a welcoming environment for supporters attending matches and those participating in them.
“We cannot, and will not, accept this type of behaviour inside our stadiums, as we know our clubs won’t.”
Holmes, 24, was substituted in the 74th minute against Brentford, with the incident occurring nine minutes after the Bees’ third equaliser.
A statement on the Brentford website read: “Brentford Football Club can confirm that a season-ticket holder was arrested following today’s game against Derby County.
“The man in question has been accused of committing a racially-aggravated public order offence in the later stages of today’s game. He was identified at the time, removed from the ground and subsequently arrested.” "

Figures published by the Central Bureau of Statistics in late 2018 revealed the extent to which Israel is currently suffering from a serious bout of “brain drain,” or human capital flight.According to the bureau, 33,000 recipients, or 5.8% of those who were awarded degrees in Israel between the academic years 1980-81 through 2010-11 spent at least three years living abroad by 2017, with highly trained individuals primarily emigrating to the United States and Europe. This figure was almost double among doctoral graduates, with 11% of Israeli PhD holders taking their knowledge abroad for at least three years. The phenomenon even led the government to launch a five-year initiative in 2010 to bring Israeli expertise back to the domestic market so it might benefit domestically from Israeli know-how.While Israelis are often attracted by the bright lights of New York City, the innovation of Silicon Valley or the vibes of Berlin, some non-Israelis are equally tempted by the hi-tech story of Tel Aviv and the golden stone of Jerusalem.After US-based software company Pendo acquired Tel Aviv-based mobile engagement start-up Insert Mobile Technologies in 2017, and established a research and development center in Herzliya, Seattle-born chief product officer Brian Crofts jumped at the opportunity to relocate to the “Start-Up Nation.”“From a work standpoint, I had read something about innovation being the leading export of the country, and it was something I wanted to learn more about,” Crofts told The Jerusalem Post.“I wanted to see first-hand what that sort of country would look like. I’ve worked with companies and start-ups all over the world seeking innovation, and here is this country that has more start-ups per capita that, until recently, has discovered no natural resources.”Founded in 2013, Pendo offers a product experience platform that provides user insight, guidance and communication to digital product teams.Enthused by the success of its entry into the Israeli market, the company currently plans to triple its R&D workforce in the country. Headquartered in North Carolina, a location not necessarily known for its innovation ecosystem, Pendo is currently growing at the rate of any Silicon Valley start-up.Pendo’s Israel office is primarily made of up mobile developers, product managers and designers, as well as recruiting and administrative staff.“I’ve learned first-hand that constraints, whether resources or time, do bring out innovation. I’ve always heard about it, but I’ve seen it first-hand here,” said Crofts.“I would teach it whenever we were brainstorming on a particular topic. How do use all the constraints to eke out something more innovative? We can use our chutzpa, brains and resilience to create an amazing culture of innovation.”Crofts also arrived in the country with his wife and four children.“As a father, I want to expose my children to the world, so they see that the world is a much smaller place than they think, and the United States isn’t the center of it all. I want them to see that the world is small and they’re capable of doing anything,” Crofts said.“We’re Christian, so there’s also the religious standpoint, going to the Galilee, Jerusalem, Nazareth and Capernaum. All the Scriptures and stories have come alive.”Having worked remotely outside of company headquarters, in New York, London and Tel Aviv, Crofts has emerged as a strong advocate for taking into account the different needs of teams operating in distant locations.“It’s hard to build trust and empathy when you are 10,000 miles away. We’re a technology company, but we’re always talking about spending time with the teams in person to help morale, understand and connect,” said Crofts.“Despite all the technology, we go to every site to physically connect, hold dinners, one-on-ones and anything we can do to create those relationships. So when we return to video calls, there is that trust and empathy.”

Nicole Mullen and Kathie Lee Gifford were sitting and brainstorming ideas for the music video for their new song, “The God Who Sees.”Mullen and Gifford wrote the song together, and Mullen provided the vocals while Gifford was gearing up to direct the video. The pair discussed what kind of props Mullen might use on stage, and what kind of images might be projected behind her. But then Gifford – the longtime TODAY show co-host – had a different idea in mind: “We’re going to Israel.” So last month the duo and their crew arrived in the Holy Land to film the 13-minute music video, which was released on Friday.“We went, and we had a wonderful time, we had a wonderful film shoot with some great, talented people,” Mullen told The Jerusalem Post in a recent phone interview. “And it was beautiful because we were able to use Israelis, Palestinians, African Americans, Caucasians – to come together to do something that says ‘God sees all of us.’”Mullen said they filmed all around Israel, at the Sea of Galilee, on the Mount of Olives, on Mount Arbel, in the Judean Desert and in the caves of Bethlehem. Against those backdrops, Mullen both recites and sings the songs lyrics, which center on the biblical characters Hagar and Ruth, before transitioning to sing about Jesus.“I would love for people to have their appetites whet to visit Israel,” Mullen said. “And see that it is a land of beauty, even though it is a land of history it is a land of relevance... the film will show the beauty of the land, the beauty of the people.”Gifford ended her 15-year run as a host on the TODAY show – first alongside Regis Philbin and then with Hoda Kotb – just last week. The 65-year-old host, singer and author has said she now wants to get into filmmaking, directing and acting.“It needed the Holy Land,” Gifford said in a behind-the-scenes interview for the short film. “It needed to set this woman – representing all the people in the desert experiences that they’re having... I knew from going to Israel as often as I have, where I wanted her on a ledge, singing certain lyrics.”Gifford and Mullen agreed that they see the film as encouraging Christians to visit Israel themselves.“I’m trying to achieve another tool with this,” Gifford said in the video. “Come to the Holy Land. Visit it. Go to the places where these things actually happened. Learn what the words really mean.”Mullen said Gifford made sure with all her power that the film would be made the way she envisioned.“She got together a great team of people, she reached into her own pocket and she put her money where her mouth is,” Mullen told the Post. “She said ‘If nobody else comes to the table – I’m going to do it. Because I want to see people given hope from the gospel of Christ. I want to see people love the land of Israel and see it and want to come and explore it, and if I have to put my own money into it for that to happen, then I’ll do that,’ so that’s what she did.”Mullen said her own visit – her second to Israel – helped drive home something that she hopes those who watch the video understand.“We, especially here in the West, it’s very foreign for us to remember that the Bible was not written in California. It wasn’t written here in the States, but it was written in the Middle East,” she said. “And the culture and some of the messages that are taught sometimes can escape us. [But in Israel] we can see it and we can feel it and we can experience it.”

De Bruyne says City will struggle to reach quadruple target,www.freemalaysiatoday.com,AFP,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/sports/2019/04/07/de-bruyne-says-city-will-struggle-to-reach-quadruple-target/,"De Bruyne says City will struggle to reach quadruple target By April 7, 2019 9:00 PM Manchester City’s Kevin De Bruyne in action. (Reuters pic)
LONDON: Kevin De Bruyne admits the strain of chasing the quadruple means Manchester City are almost certain to fail in their historic bid.
Pep Guardiola’s side edged closer to an unprecedented clean sweep of all four major trophies as they beat Brighton 1-0 in Saturday’s FA Cup semi-final at Wembley.
Having already won the League Cup, City are through to their second domestic final of the season.
They are also embroiled in the Premier League title race, trailing leaders Liverpool by two points with a game in hand.
On Tuesday, they face Tottenham in the Champions League quarter-final first leg in north London.
Yet Guardiola described the quadruple attempt as “almost impossible” after the Brighton game.
City midfielder De Bruyne agrees that the congested fixture list presents a tough obstacle due to mounting mental and physical strain.
“It is nearly impossible. I don’t think it is impossible to win every game, (looking) game by game, but if you see the fixtures coming up – I think every game we play now we are going to be at a disadvantage physically and mentally,” he said.
“We will have a game before the other teams, the other teams will have a rest. The Champions League is the same. So, it is difficult.”
Cityise now staying in London ahead of their next testing task at Tottenham.
To underline his point, De Bruyne noted that Tottenham, who City also face in the Premier League this month, have had a free weekend ahead of the clash.
“Every game is difficult. We just now have to prepare for Tuesday,” De Bruyne said.
“We know Tottenham played their last game on Wednesday so they will be more fresh than us. We have to prepare ourselves mentally and physically to be ready.”
The game will be Tottenham’s second at their new stadium, but De Bruyne insists City won’t be troubled by the passionate atmosphere.
“The stadium doesn’t matter. They are going to be excited because it is a Champions League quarter-final,” he said.
“Spurs are a very good team. Everybody knows how they play. They will not change.
“It is going to be exciting, it is going to be tough because we play them three times in 10 days.”
While City were involved in FA Cup action over the weekend, title rivals Liverpool returned to the top of the table with a win at Southampton.
City are still favourites because of their game in hand, but De Bruyne does not think the Reds will allow any margin for error.
“Probably they will (win their games). We just have to look at ourselves and try to win game by game. We will see in the end what happens,” he said.
“No matter who is champion or second, we’ve had a great season. What can you say if you get 92 or 95 points and in the end you are second?
“Normally that’s historic in the Premier League, to get these points. Imagine being second with it.” "

(Bernama pic)
SEREMBAN: Pakatan Harapan candidate Dr Streram Sinnasamy has denied allegations that his campaign director had been detained by the police in connection with provocative buntings, photographs of which were widely shared on social media.
Streram said his campaign director, lawyer U Karunesh, was with him when he met reporters while campaigning with PKR president Anwar Ibrahim for the Rantau by-election.
“He was never arrested, he is here with me,” he said, adding that he had lodged a police report and was leaving the matter to the authorities.
Karunesh said the allegations against him were attempts to bring him down as a businessman as well as a politician.
“My friends called asking what’s the problem, I deny the allegations, please don’t make slanderous allegations, practice healthy politics, want to contest, then do it well, if there is evidence, show it,” he said.
Seremban district deputy police chief Mohd Rosli Ishak when contacted by Bernama said no arrest had been made.
Anwar hoped that action will be taken against anyone found guilty regardless of whether he was a member of PH or the opposition.
He said the police should also reopen investigations into questions raised about a bank transfer of RM10 million made by Barisan Nasional candidate Mohamad Hasan in 2008. Mohamad, a three-term menteri besar of Negeri Sembilan, is acting Umno president.
Last night Negeri Sembilan Amanah chairman Zulkefly Mohamad Omar had questioned why no action was taken against Mohamad for transferring such a large sum of money through a money changer.
Mohamad has denied wrongdoing and said that he made the transfer to buy an apartment in London. He said it was up to the police and anti-corruption officers whether they wished to investigate the case.
The Rantau by-election is a four-cornered fight between Streram, Mohamad and two independent candidates, housewife R. Malarvizhi and former lecturer Mohd Nor Yassin. Polling takes place on Saturday (April 13). "

With the 2019 Auto Shanghai less than two weeks away, car manufacturers continue to tease and tantalise by publishing obscure photos of the models expected to debut at the show.
Early this week, automotive companies like Audi, Infiniti, and Nissan began teasing their 2019 Auto Shanghai debuts. As time draws closer to the show, more and more sneak peeks drop from the likes of Karma Automotive, Faraday Future, Mercedes-Benz, and Nio.
Karma Revero
Karma Automotive revealed last month that it is planning on bringing three new cars to Auto Shanghai this year including a new-generation Revero, a project vehicle created in collaboration with Pininfarina, and a fully electric concept model dubbed the Vision Concept.
Since that announcement was made, all models have been teased ahead of their debuts, but on Thursday, Karma offered yet another view of the upcoming Revero.
Faraday Future V9 Concept
Also on Thursday, Faraday Future CEO YT Jia published a teaser image of the brand’s upcoming V9 Concept, a model being developed with Chinese online game operator The9 Limited.
Mercedes Concept GLB
The Mercedes Concept GLB is functioning as a precursor to an eventual production version of the model that will slide in between the GLA- and GLC-Classes. While the image teased appears to be a sketch, we can expect the real deal to be just as luxurious.
Nio ET7 Concept
Motor Authority reported Thursday that Nio released a teaser for the ET7 concept which looks to be a sedan donning a fastback roof. According to the manufacturer, the model will sport Level 4 self-driving capability allowing it to operate with nearly no driver involvement.
These models will be on display at 2019 Auto Shanghai which opens to the public on April 16. "

(Bloomberg pic)
AMMAN: Jordan is talking to the World Bank about a US$1 billion soft loan as it seeks to cut the cost of its debt repayments and revive an economy strained by more than a million Syrian refugees.
The government’s “moving on several fronts to reduce the high debt burden by considering concessional loans and focusing on triggering economic growth,” Prime Minister Omar Razzaz said at a World Economic Forum meeting on Jordan’s Dead Sea shores.
It’s seeking a 30-year facility with the World Bank and an interest rate of 4%, he said.
Jordan, whose public debt of 28.3 billion dinars (US$39.9 billion) nearly equals economic output, has been hurt by the rise in global commodity prices.
The US last year committed to giving Jordan more than US$6 billion in aid over the next five years, up from US$1 billion annually, while Saudi Arabia and two allied Gulf nations pledged an assistance package after a proposed income tax increase sparked some of the biggest protests since the Arab Spring.
Regional wars took a toll on the economy, with unemployment at a two-decade high stirring discontent.
The recent reopening of Jordan’s border with Iraq after Islamic State militants were pushed from the area has fueled an annual 13.6% in increase in Jordanian exports in the first quarter of this year.
“We are working on driving economic growth, increasing exports,” said Razzaz. The two countries also plan to connect their electric grids and build an industrial zone near the border, he said.
Jordan will also start receiving oil from Iraq by tanker “very soon,” according to the premier, under a February deal for 10,000 barrels of crude per day. He said that a planned oil pipeline from Basra in Iraq to Jordan’s Aqaba would “see the light” in three years, without elaborating. "

KOTA KINABALU: Sabah DAP pleaded with opposition MPs in Sabah and Sarawak today to stop playing politics and instead support the Bill to amend Article 1(2) of the Federal Constitution.
Sabah DAP secretary Chan Foong Hin said Sabah MPs such as opposition leader Jeffrey Kitingan (Keningau) and PBRS deputy president Arthur Kurup (Pensiangan) had been playing politics by attending the launch of Sabah PPBM yesterday while also rejecting the bill in Parliament.
“They went and welcomed Prime Minister Dr Mahathir Mohamad – they have shown their political affinity towards the leader of the federal ruling coalition. Therefore they should cease their meaningless attack on the proposed amendment and help their fellow Sabahan, federal minister Liew Vui Keong, to push for the amendment to be passed.
“We need to undo the wrongdoings of the past,” said Chan, who is MP for Kota Kinabalu. “I hope Jeffrey and Arthur (and the rest) come back (to the Dewan Rakyat) to support the second and third reading of the Bill on Tuesday.”
Sabah politicians had described the Bill as inadequate.
Chan said a failure to pass the Bill would have an adverse impact on negotiations on states’ rights under the Malaysia Agreement 1963 (MA63).
The amendment seeks to reverse a previous amendment in 1976 which placed Sabah and Sarawak as one of 13 states in Malaysia.
Politicians in Sabah and Sarawak have sought a return to the pre-1976 clause in which Sabah and Sarawak are listed separately from the States of Malaya.
Chan pleaded for their support. “It is not easy for Liew to successfully convince his colleagues in the Cabinet to agree to this amendment,” he said.
If the proposed amendment failed to pass, it could mean “the end of the MA63 committees”, Chan said.
“The MA63 committee is still doing its work and more amendments are in the pipeline. It is massively difficult to get a consensus on Sabah and Sarawak matters,” he said.
Sabah DAP held the convention of the Wanita wing today, at which state Law and Native Affairs assistant minister Jannie Lasimbang retained her post as Wanita chief, with Tenom MP Noorita Sual as her deputy. "

KHARTOUM: Thousands of Sudanese protesters rallied outside the army’s headquarters in the capital Sunday for a second day calling on the military to back them in demands that President Omar al-Bashir resign as police fired tear gas to disperse them.
Chanting “Sudan is rising, the army is rising,” crowds of men and women massed outside the complex that also houses Bashir’s official residence and the defence ministry, many of them having spent the night there, witnesses said.
“After what we did yesterday, we will not leave this area now until our mission is accomplished,” said protester Osama Ahmed, who spent the night outside the compound.
“We won’t leave this area until he steps down,” he said, referring to Bashir.
Protesters whistled and waved at military vehicles entering the compound, prompting some soldiers to wave back, a day after demonstrators said they were gathering to ask the army to “come join us”.
Riot police deployed near the complex Sunday morning, firing tear gas to disperse the crowds, a witness told AFP.
Protest organisers chose April 6 to begin the rally outside the army headquarters to mark the 1985 uprising that toppled the then regime of president Jaafar Nimeiri.
Ahead of the demonstration, organisers had urged the army to either “take the side of the people or the dictator’s”.
Chanting the movement’s catchcry “freedom, peace, justice”, thousands of men and women marched through the streets of the capital Saturday, reaching the fortified army complex for the first time since anti-government protests first broke out.
The rally was the biggest yet since protests erupted on December 19 in the central town of Atbara, quickly spreading to the capital and towns and cities across the country.
Rally organisers on Sunday urged the demonstrators to continue with their sit-in outside the army complex.
“We call on our people from areas near Khartoum to join those who are at the army headquarters,” the organisers said in a statement.
Since the start of the protests, security agents and riot police have cracked down on demonstrators but the army has not intervened.
‘Losing bet’
Witnesses said groups of women, men and children were walking towards the complex from several parts of the capital.
Some protesters blocked a nearby bridge linking Khartoum with the northern Bahari district with rocks causing huge traffic jams, onlookers said.
Outside the army complex, protesters sang nationalist songs, whistling and clapping as they pressed on with the rally.
Several private companies declared a holiday at their offices, while some arranged to ferry water, snacks and juice to the protesters, according to witnesses.
In a separate demonstration on Saturday a protester was killed in Khartoum’s twin city of Omdurman, police said.
Officials say 32 people have died since protests erupted in the east African country after a government decision to triple the price of bread.
Human Rights Watch has put the death toll to 51 including medics and children.
Rallies over bread prices quickly morphed into protests against Bashir’s government, with demonstrators accusing it of mismanaging the economy, leading to soaring food prices and regular shortages of fuel and foreign currency.
Bashir has acknowledged that the economic concerns raised by protesters are “legitimate”, but he imposed emergency rule on February 22 after an initial crackdown failed to rein in the protests.
The scale and intensity of protests have shrunk since the emergency rule went into effect.
But with Saturday’s rally analysts say the protest movement has gained new momentum.
“The scale of protests on Saturday illustrates that Bashir’s gamble that he can save his regime through repression is proving to be a losing bet,” said Murithi Mutiga of the International Crisis Group.
Bashir, wanted by the Hague-based International Criminal Court for alleged war crimes and genocide in the conflict-wracked region of Darfur, swept to power in an Islamist-backed coup in 1989.
The veteran leader has remained defiant, introducing tough measures that have seen protesters, opposition leaders, activists and journalists arrested. "

LENGGONG: The Mineral and Geoscience Department (JMG) and the National Water Services Commission will conduct a detailed study to identify the sources of pollution in Sungai Rui, Gerik.
Last Thursday, Perak executive councillor Abdul Aziz Bari had said that recent tests by the department had shown a high arsenic content in the river water.
Water, Land and Natural Resources Minister Xavier Jayakumar said the department had set up a task force to identify solutions to the water pollution by regularly sampling water at several locations.
He said in general, Klian Intan, Hulu Perak, had been identified as an area rich in minerals such as tin and sulphide minerals. such as arsenopyrite and pyrite.
Any mining or land-clearing activities could lead to a natural acidic reaction, which in turn could release heavy metals such as arsenic, iron, lead, zinc and nickel into the water, he added.
He said JMG would provide mapping data on mining, logging, agriculture, industrial activities as well as the location of Perak Water Board water treatment plants and JMG’s water wells in Hulu Perak.
Xavier said the river was a raw water source for the Air Ganda treatment plant, which supplied water to 1,000 villagers with a capacity of 0.68 million litres per day.
“We do not want to point fingers at any one party without properly identifying in detail the causes of the pollution.”
Xavier was speaking to reporters after visiting a eucalyptus farm with Peninsular Malaysia Forestry Department director-general Akhirrudin Mahmud and several foreign envoys in Bukit Sapi here today.
Commenting on his visit today, Xavier said eucalyptus trees had good potential to be planted under the Forest Farm Development Programme.
He said this was due to their short yield of seven to eight years, making it a good investment opportunity.
“We will do a study on the cultivation of these eucalyptus trees, which can be used in a variety of products.
“It could become a future source of income for the country, thus reducing our dependence on oil palm,” he added. "

PETALING JAYA: The Sultan of Johor has thanked the federal government for “listening to the people” in withdrawing from the Rome Statute and membership of the International Criminal Court.
Sultan Ibrahim Sultan Iskandar also thanked Putrajaya for respecting and accepting the view of the Conference of Rulers.
He said in a posting on Facebook: “I hope the government will always prioritise the interests of the people ahead of political interests.”
He also said that he would ensure that “the nation’s sovereignty and harmony among the people are always looked after”.
The Rome Statute is an international agreement that created the International Criminal Court for prosecution of those who commit genocide, war crimes and other crimes against humanity.
On Friday, Prime Minister Dr Mahathir Mohamad announced Putrajaya’s decision to withdraw from the treaty, and said smear campaigns had been conducted by “certain quarters” who had politicised the issue.
Yesterday, PKR president Anwar Ibrahim revealed that Mahathir was referring to a particular “personality” from a royal family when stating that opponents to the Rome Statute were trying to pit the Malay rulers against the federal government.
Foreign Minister Saifuddin Abdullah also said Malaysia withdrew from ratifying the statute because there was a possibility of the issue being manipulated to the extent that people would take to the streets. "

The Venice Biennale announced Thursday that Jimmie Durham will be the recipient of this year’s Golden Lion for Lifetime Achievement.
The American artist was nominated by Ralph Rugoff, the curator of the 58th International Art Exhibition, “May You Live in Interesting Times.”
His recommendation was approved by the biennale’s board of directors, chaired by Paolo Baratta.
In a statement, Rugoff praised Durham for “his remarkable accomplishments as an artist over the past six decades, and in particular for making art that is at once critical, humorous and profoundly humanistic.”
Given that Durham participated in five previous editions of the Biennale, “we should probably be giving him two lifetime awards by this point in time,” the curator added.
In addition to the award, Durham’s work will be included in the Biennale.
Best known for his sculptural constructions, the 78-year-old artist also works in drawing, collage, photography and video. His artworks are often accompanied by texts that confront Eurocentric views and racial prejudice.
As a member of the American Indian Movement, Durham has focused on colonialism and Native American identity in his work.
He identifies as a Cherokee – although his claims of Native heritage were disputed by ten Cherokee artists and curators in 2017.
This year’s Golden Lion will be presented in Venice on May 11. Previous winners include Carolee Schneemann in 2017 and El Anatsui in 2015. "

The step will let the Italian carmaker offset carbon dioxide emissions from its cars against Tesla’s, by bringing down its average figure to a permissible level, the FT said.

Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Sunday.
Fiat Chrysler did not directly address the amount that it would pay but added it would “optimise the options for compliance that the regulations offer.”

IPOH: Deputy Prime Minister Dr Wan Azizah Wan Ismail wants overlaps in Technical Vocational Education and Training (TVET) provided by various ministries to be streamlined for the system to be more effective.
She said based on the existing structure, six ministries are involved in implementing TVET.
These are the education ministry, human resources ministry, youth and sports ministry, agriculture and agro-based industry ministry, rural development ministry, and women, family and community development ministry.
“The overlapping of education systems, certification, development funding constraints, and the uncertainty faced by TVET graduates are among the challenges which need to be addressed and resolved,” she said when officiating the golden jubilee celebration of Malaysian polytechnics at Politeknik Ungku Omar here today.
Deputy Education Minister Teo Nie Ching was also present.
Politeknik Ungku Omar was selected as the celebration venue as it is the first polytechnic in the country, set up in 1969.
Wan Azizah hoped the TVET supervisory committee, announced by Education Minister Maszlee Malik in November last year, could help solve the issues.
The committee is expected to coordinate and rationalise training.
The women, family and community development minister said industry players should also be more involved in the process for TVET training to succeed.
“Industries should always communicate with TVET institutions regarding the needs of the work force to avoid a mismatch between the demand and supply in the job market.
“I suggest that polytechnics continue to strengthen collaboration with industries through the ‘teaching factory’ concept by bringing in more industry engagement into polytechnics in the various fields.”
She said the concept would involve apprenticeship, work-based learning and “learn and earn”. "
Megyn Kelly Hoping To Stage A Right-Wing Media Comeback,crooksandliars.com,NewsHound Ellen,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://crooksandliars.com/2019/04/megyn-kelly-hoping-stage-right-wing-media,"Image from: Screengrab
Like a bad penny, Megyn Kelly seems poised to turn up again in the media once Donald Trump goes away, assuming he ever does. But I've got some unsolicited advice for her to do better by doing good.
While she sits at home counting the $69 million she made from her ill-fated and truncated NBC career, The Daily Beast reports that Kelly is plotting a return to right-wing media right around the time Trump may lose re-election:
[“A source close to Kelly” said]: “The urgency to fire it back up for the next day to three months is pretty low. But ever? Like in a year? Much higher. It’s not like she’s sprinting and saying ‘I gotta get there now.’ But she does want to get informed and get to a place where she can make a really good decision. So she’s sort of setting herself up for that now and patiently going about that process. But no doubt, the engines will fire up at some point.”
[…]
Kelly herself predicted—to a TMZ crew that miraculously ran into her one January night on an Upper East Side sidewalk—that she’ll be back on television sometime this year. The encounter was a prelude to what looked to media observers like a planted Feb. 26 Page Six item headlined “Megyn Kelly eyes October return for 2020 race.”
It’s unlikely that Kelly will get a spot on a major network any time soon given that she has managed to antagonize viewers and co-workers at NBC and Fox News . Unless she starts donning a MAGA hat and starts railing about the “deep state,” it’s unlikely she’ll fit in again at Fox right now.
But after 2020? That could be a whole different scenario. Lachlan Murdoch didn’t completely shut the door last November, just before the midterm elections:
""I'm a big fan of Megyn's. I like her a lot. We didn't want her to leave Fox when she did,"" the CEO of New Fox said at The New York Times' annual DealBook Conference. ""Having said that, I'm very happy with our current lineup on Fox, and we won't be making any changes there."" ↓ Story continues below ↓
The Daily Beast suggests that Kelly’s return may be via a lower-profile (and lower-paying) media presence, maybe at Newsmax, Sinclair or even via podcast. But it's easy to see her returning to Fox News, especially if it's a bit less of a Trump PR operation at some point next year. ""Several industry insiders"" told The Daily Beast they also think Fox a logical place for Kelly to reboot.
But I’ve got some unsolicited advice for Kelly: She’s got enough money to keep her and her family more than comfortable for the rest of their lives. Why not use this time to do something for a cause greater than herself? Nothing would rehabilitate her racist image better than putting some serious efforts and money into a mission on behalf of African Americans. Not incidentally, it could actually bring the kind of reward and benefits that neither money nor fame could ever deliver."

Her goal is to “economically empower” 50 million women in developing countries by 2025 at the cost of $100 million. As Ivanka embarks on her plan to help support women in Africa, the Trump administration is simultaneously dismantling women’s health and rights in the very same countries Ivanka will be visiting. Just last week Secretary of State Mike Pompeo Michael (Mike) Richard Pompeo US pulls troops out of Libya amid rise in violence Secrecy behind Saudi nuclear talks infuriates Congress Our First Amendment rights are under assault with the global gag rule MORE took steps to dramatically expand the implementation of the Global Gag Rule — a policy that prohibits foreign nongovernmental organizations who receive U.S. federal aid from performing or providing information on abortion. The rule, enacted by every Republican president since Reagan, has been catastrophic, imperiling women’s health, driving up unwanted pregnancies and unsafe abortions, and contributing to global poverty. The ill effects extend far beyond limiting abortion rights, impacting every facet of reproductive health and constraining NGOs’ ability to lobby for reform. The new move goes beyond any previous interpretation by other administrations, restricting “gagged” organizations from funding groups that provide abortion services and information, even though those organizations don’t get any U.S. aid. It’s not only an outrageous overreach of an onerous policy that forces organizations to either stay true to their mission and turn down funding from the U.S. government, or comply with a policy that compromises their mandate — it underscores the antithetical programs coming out of Trump’s White House in the guise of women’s empowerment and advancing prosperity for marginalized communities. It also shows a breathtaking lack of self-awareness by Ivanka and our government. How can her program empower women economically as clinics in their communities shut down and if they can’t easily access basic items and services like contraceptives and maternal health care? Is gagging abortion advocates meant to empower them? Research shows that without access to basic reproductive health care, women can’t thrive economically. Expanding contraceptive use improves women’s agency, education and labor force participation. Yet across Africa, there is an unmet need for family planning, and low contraceptive use keeps women from achieving their desired family size, limiting women’s economic advancement. While shameful, this is not all that surprising. The White House is dismantling hard-won rights to reproductive health and freedom at home and abroad at a pace unlike any other previous administration. When Trump first reinstated the Global Gag Rule as one of his first executive orders in office in 2017, he applied it to an unprecedented amount of global health assistance funds , resulting in devastating impacts on groups that work on everything from water and sanitation to HIV and AIDS. Two years later, the Trump administration reinstated the “Domestic Gag Rule,” an anti-choice policy that bans providers in the U.S. from receiving government funds from referring patients for abortion services. The rule is set to take effect on May 4. At the Open Society Foundations, we have a long history of fighting for basic human rights, including those to health and equality. We’ve worked to protect and expand reproductive rights across the globe, most recently standing with organizations that overturned Ireland’s abortion ban. In the U.S., we have supported Planned Parenthood’s efforts to stave off the closure of clinics and worked to rebuff legislation aimed at chipping away at Roe v. Wade.
When we talk about women’s empowerment, we mean it. We have battled against the Global Gag Rule and similar attempts to place unconstitutional restrictions on NGOs’ ability to advocate on health issues for years. When Congress sought to place restrictions on federal funding for groups fighting HIV and AIDS that didn’t explicitly oppose prostitution, the foundations challenged the act in court. In 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court found in our favor , ruling that the act violated organizations’ First Amendment rights by mandating that they “pledge allegiance to the government’s policy.” We know the damage the Global Gag Rule has wrought on basic human rights and economic development for communities worldwide, and we are committed to minimizing its harms, and seeing that the policy is permanently repealed. As a funder that champions open democratic values and human rights, we will not be gagged, nor will we stand by as the vibrant movements we support are attacked. If Ivanka wants her program to succeed, she should start by pressuring her own government to repeal the policies that hurt women’s health and advancement the most. Jonathan Cohen is the director of the public health program at Open Society Foundations where he oversees grant making and advocacy to improve social inclusion in public health policy and practice. Cohen previously served as director of the law and health initiative at Open Society Foundations where he oversaw legal aid and litigation in over 15 countries. Kavita N. Ramdas is director of the Women’s Rights Program at Open Society Foundations and a globally recognized advocate for gender equity and justice, previously serving as a president and CEO of the Global Fund for Women and as a senior advisor at Ford Foundation."

He issued orders, and her garments were tightened around her (so that her private parts would not become uncovered) then he stoned her, then he offered the funeral prayer for her."" - Sunan Ibn Majah Book 20 Hadith 2555
There you have it. A woman came to Prophet Muhammed and confessed her sin of fornication. The prophet had the woman stoned. Quite a contrast to our Lord Jesus Christ, who said ""Let him who is without sin cast the first stone"", isn't it?
""[As for] the thief, the male and the female, amputate their hands in recompense for what they committed as a deterrent [punishment] from Allah . And Allah is Exalted in Might and Wise."" - Quran 5:38
By mandating that fornicators, adulterers and homosexuals be stoned to death, and thieves have their hand amputated, the Sultan of Brunei is only trying to follow his beautiful religion of peace. The commands of Islam, as per the Quran and the Hadiths, are very clear. I hope Oxford University haven't become Islamophobic, have they?"
