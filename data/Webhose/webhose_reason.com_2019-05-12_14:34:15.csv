When government is involved, the freedom of speech is indeed an issue, but realistically, schools are going to have to make some restrictions on what their students are allowed to say. This demonstrates perfectly why the entire concept of public school is threatening to civil liberties. All schools should be private and should be allowed to make whatever kind of rules about speech that they want.
I'm nervous though about the ACLU. since when have they ever been on the right side of a court case. The ACLU has a frustrating tendency to ruin legitimate arguments with their overtly liberalism talking points which demand more government solutions instead of fewer."

And here we see why Reason is so frustrating to me. Gillespe has no real reason why the free movement of people should be more important than the free movement of goods and services...he just figures it ought to be.
But indeed, if we really want to maximize impact, we should be talking about goods and services first. Far more people are affected by a container ship traveling over from China than are affected by a shipping container filled with central american refugees.

There are very valid points that increased trade, increased automation and increased high skilled immigration are beneficial. But there seems to be too much belief that the negative trade offs can be ignored. Despite the overwhelming evidence that those trade offs have very real costs.

I don't see why nationalism and free trade need to be in opposition, and I see clearly why libertarians should want to keep politicians as accountable to their local constituencies as possible.
Libertarianism is not about seizing the reigns of powers and inflicting free trade or open borders on the American people against their will by keeping policy makers as unaccountable to the voters as possible through globalism. Those issues, along with the power to declare war and tax, were properly given to our Congress in the Constitution because it is inappropriate for government to inflict wars, taxes, or immigration policies on free people--over their objections and against their will. Rather, libertarian policies are meant to be adopted willingly by free people who want them, and it is the purpose of libertarians to persuade our fellow Americans to demand more freedom from our politicians.
Persuading our fellow Americans that they shouldn't have any say on naturalization, etc. is a surefire way to ensure that our fellow Americans will turn their backs on our arguments for open borders. Why would anybody believe we want them to be free to make choices for themselves when we're trying to undermine their ability to influence policy through the politicians who are accountable to them? Yes, it makes us come across as disingenuous."

Surely Nick sees that putting a bunch of global socialists into power would ultimately reduce our freedoms far more than putting a nationalist free trader in power- even if that meant immigrants couldn't come here more easily.

Democracy has its proper purview--hence the separation of powers.
During the American Revolution, this came across in standards like ""No Taxation without Representation"".
Governments should not be able to force its population to go to war without the approval of the legislature either.
Deciding how one becomes a citizen of a country is also fundamentally within the proper purview of democracy. Our government also shoudln't be able to commit us to international treaties without our consent, hence the need for the Senate to ratify them.
These principles are applicable to all countries. These duties of government are within the proper purview of democracy in all societies. No free people can have these things inflicted on them by the government over their objections and without their consent--which is why they are properly within the purview of democracy.
The idea that our rights don't exist if there's a democracy is absurd. Rights are the obligation to respect the agency of others. Our First Amendment makes does an excellent job of distinguishing between the proper purview of democracy and our rights when it starts, ""Congress shall make now law"". Rights are thoroughly compatible with democracy when democracy is restricted to its proper purview, and immigration and trade agreements are both well within that purview."

That was written about Reagan Democrats in 1980 and 1984, but if you added something to the Democrat leadership's list of concerns about LGBTQI+ and radical environmentalists, it could have been written about Trump Democrats in 2016.
There was a large number of Republicans who would have voted for whomever the Republicans nominated--especially against Hillary Clinton. There was a significant number of white, blue collar voters from the rust belt states of Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin who broke against their unions and voted for Trump because after eight years of being hated on by the progressives who run the Democratic party for being white, blue collar, heterosexual, rednecks, etc. they were finally persuaded that the Democratic party doesn't like them."

Can someone show me why I should believe that the globalists who run Europe want free trade outside of the European Union or free immigration for anyone but other Europeans within it? Sure, they may take in refugees--people who supposedly don't have any choice but to flee to the European Union--but what about the rest of us? If I decide as an American that I want to move to France and look for a job, what are the chances that the EU's ""globalist"" immigration policies mean it will be easy for me to get such a visa? Is it not harder for someone in the U.S. to legally emigrate to the EU than it is for someone in the EU to emigrate to the U.S.? Why should I believe that that so called globalists who run the EU want free trade with countries outside the EU?

False. A democracy is mob rule, there are no rights.
A system in which there are rights excludes the majority from EVER violating them (or they aren't rights). Ergo, a ""democracy"" that actually respects rights cannot tax, prevent people from entering others' property, or decide to murder (war). (Fits nicely with ""life, liberty, and property"".)

You say that you believe the policies of free trade and open borders are good for the country so you ask for it at the national level. I believe that these same policies of free trade and open borders are good for the entire world, and so I think they ought to be put at the global level. If either of us got our way, the affect here at home would not be too different (though I think global free trade would be better for us, than just national free trade). Likewise, if a nationalist government signed on to the Paris Accords because it believed it would help that nation (in addition to the rest of the world), the affect is just the same whether they are nationalists or globalists at heart. Indeed, in the US, we are already a nation mediating between vastly different groups of people from the coasts to the heartland. Choosing what is best for 50.1% of the country isn't terribly different than choosing what is best for 50.1% of the world.
That is why Nick's whole article is so incoherent. Globalism vs Nationalism is a distinction without a difference for libertarians. Whether you are talking about a small town, a small nation, a large nation (like ours) or the entire world, it's just a difference in numbers that are under a given jurisdiction. It is what that jurisdiction does that is so important, and why I think Nick is crazy to think there can be common cause with global socialists."

She was asked by the administrators to do something and didn't. Subsequently asked by the officers to do something and didn't. The fact that she didn't do anything was the issue. The same way that when someone says ""Get off my property."" and you refuse, *you're* the problem."

Even if the police are in the right and up against a legitimate criminal, the use of force should be limited to no more than is necessary to stop any violent actions that may be occurring. Instead, too many police think that the people they accost should be completely docile, obedient, and unresisting, and the police are willing to use excessive force to bring people to that condition. That is not an acceptable use of force, in my opinion.
As a society, we need to seriously re-think the acceptable use of force by law enforcement officers."
