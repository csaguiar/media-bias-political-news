Sophie Lanfear/Silverback/Netflix Our Planet is the kind of nature show where every image could be a screen saver: sweeping, dramatic landscapes are full of colorful animals.
But among the high-definition scenes of lions on the hunt, there are some images you don't often see in these kinds of shows. Tropical reefs bleach into white bone-scapes; glaciers crumble into Arctic seas. In one particularly noteworthy sequence, confused walruses plummet off a cliff to their deaths — a phenomenon that the show links to climate change and the decline of the walrus' preferred habitat of sea ice.
Animals Following The Lives Of Chimpanzees On Screen, With Alastair Fothergill Series producer Alastair Fothergill was responsible for some of the most high-profile nature documentaries of the last decade: Planet Earth , Blue Planet , Frozen Planet . In an interview, he says that it has previously been difficult to include environmental messaging in prime-time, mass-audience programming — and even so, that Our Planet is careful to show where earth is still very healthy, or has bounced back.
But while other nature programs might make passing reference to the impact of humans, that narrative is at the center of Our Planet .
""We decided way back, actually in 2012, that the time had come to try and do a series which would be as entertaining and as accessible as series like Planet Earth — but for the first time deal in depth with the challenges that our planet faces,"" Fothergill says. ""There's no doubt that it is seriously under threat. And we felt that it was a story that urgently needed telling now.""
The eight-part series, narrated by David Attenborough , is now streaming on Netflix.
Interview Highlights On planning a project of this scale and rarity
Enlarge this image Alastair Fothergill is the producer of Our Planet. Silverback/Netflix Silverback/Netflix Alastair Fothergill is the producer of Our Planet.
Silverback/Netflix We spent a whole year planning: talking to scientists, talking to conservationists, deciding on our stories. And then we filmed over three years, and we spend a record 3,500 days in the field. To give you an idea, that means every final minute of the show you watch, we spent 10 days in the field. ...
But we were very specific. Although the animals don't read the script, we have a very, very organized and planned script and we knew exactly the narrative that we wanted to tell. ... What is very important to us is that each individual episode tell a bigger story about each individual habitat. Because what's very interesting is the challenges to the habitats, the threats to the habitats and the solutions to those habitats differ, depending on whether it's the open ocean, the tropical forest or the coniferous forest.
On capturing the Siberian tiger in the wild
I think the Siberian tiger is a wonderful achievement. It's the first intimate images of these amazing cats in the wild. And to give you a sense of how difficult it was, over two winters, three cameramen were literally locked away inside wooden hides. They didn't come out for six weeks. Everything you need to do to survive, they did inside the small box. And they worked for two winters. They got one single shot of a wild Siberian tiger. At the same time, we had in about 40 motion-control cameras — remote cameras that are set off by the moving animal. And again, the first winter we got nothing really. We got lynx going past, other animals of the forest. But over that period we began to see the movements of the tigers, how they were moving in that area. And the second season we got 36 precious, precious images. For me, it's a wonderfully emblematic sequence of a wonderfully rare, wild, iconic species of the boreal forest.

Kieran O'Donovan/Netflix On the images the show missed
You know, failure is my job, and we failed a lot. Often to get the sequence, we'd go one season — as I described the Siberian tiger — back and back and back. And yes, there are things that we still have to do and still have to film — which is great, because I've still got the life in me.
On the forest sequence in Madagascar
The patch of forest where we were filming was destroyed by the end of our filming period, yes. It was desperately, desperately sad. I mean, you know, Madagascar is a poor country. There's a lot of pressure; people need land. But the traditional forest — there's only 3 percent left. It's got so many precious, precious animals there. We really need to help those people to preserve the lemurs and all the wonderful forests that they live in.
On the forest sequence in Chernobyl
Thirty-three years ago, of course, famously the [nuclear] reactor at Chernobyl exploded. It was probably the greatest environmental disaster in living memory. And 30 years later, we ... go back and amazingly, the forest, the resilient forest, has overtaken Chernobyl. It's a green oasis now. And because people can't go there for very long because of the radiation — it's dangerous for us to stay there for a long period — it's been left alone.
And we found that an enormous variety of animals had returned, including the wolf. The wolf is an apex predator. The wolves are only there if beneath it, there's a very, very healthy community. And we now know that there are seven times more wolves in the Chernobyl exclusion zone than anywhere else in Eastern Europe. And the key point — and it's very important in our series to remind people — [is] that nature is resilient. And if we give it space, if we work together to preserve it, it can bounce back. And Chernobyl is a wonderful example of that.

NPR's Ailsa Chang speaks with art historian Caroline Bruzelius about the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris, which caught on fire Monday.
AILSA CHANG, HOST:
We're going to turn now to someone who knows Notre Dame Cathedral inside and out. Art historian Caroline Bruzelius has spent years studying its Gothic architecture. Welcome.
CAROLINE BRUZELIUS: Hello.
CHANG: Now, I understand you actually spent years inside the cathedral. Can you tell us; what is it made of? Are you surprised that it caught on fire like this?
BRUZELIUS: Well, there are several things to talk about there. My work was on the cathedral while they were cleaning the interior. And I was taking advantage of that to go up a scaffolding up the height of the vaults, which are 108 feet above the ground, to try to study how the building is put together - to measure the stones, to record the moldings, to think about process of building what I call a mega-building. The cathedral was...
CHANG: Yeah.
BRUZELIUS: ...The biggest building of its time in Paris especially but in that whole region.
CHANG: And can you tell us what kind of stone it's made out of?
BRUZELIUS: So it's made out of Parisian limestone, which is quarried right there under and around the city. It's a beautiful quality of stone. But when it's exposed to fire, stone is damaged. It doesn't actually burn, but it loses its surface. It becomes friable. It chips, and it's no longer structurally sound.
CHANG: Yeah.
BRUZELIUS: But the fire, however, seems to have started in the roof. And what most people don't understand when they visit a cathedral is that above the vaults, there may be 50 to 60 or even more feet of timber that support the enormous roof above the cathedral vaults. So between the vaults and the roof, there is a forest of timber.
CHANG: Wow.
BRUZELIUS: I wish I could show you a photograph. This timber is old. It's very dry and porous.
CHANG: Very flammable.
BRUZELIUS: Very flammable.
CHANG: Now, a firefighter the scene said earlier that they're directing their efforts towards saving the artwork at the very back of the cathedral. Can you describe for us what kind of artwork is there?
BRUZELIUS: Well, a lot of that artwork was put in in the 18th century - great altar pieces, beautiful sculpture, pews - as part of an 18th century renovation of the cathedral. But there also are many, many works of art that date to the Middle Ages, not the least of which of course is some of the remaining stained glass and sculpture, all of which - because it was Notre Dame in Paris - was of the highest possible quality.
CHANG: Yeah. Now, Notre Dame is more than 850 years old. Has it ever suffered drastic damage on this level before?
BRUZELIUS: Nothing perhaps on this level.
CHANG: Yeah.
BRUZELIUS: Seeing that fire was heart-chilling, and it extended the entire length of the roof structure. The cathedral has been changed and damaged many, many times, especially after the French Revolution, which, as you know, was as much against the church as it was against the state. And a sculpture was torn off the facade. Many portals were damaged, and the stained glass windows had already partially been changed in the 18th century. So yeah, a lot of change has happened at this building, but this is a kind of cataclysmic change way beyond anything we've ever seen.
CHANG: Now, I understand you have dedicated many years to this cathedral. May I ask; what is it like personally for you to watch it burn like this?
BRUZELIUS: I would say heartrending. You know, we tend to take buildings for granted. People like myself who work on them and metaphorically crawl up and down the walls know, however, that even monumental architecture is very vulnerable and that maintenance and restoration is critical. Here, I don't really know what kind of anti-fire provisions they had up above the vaults, but clearly, as I said, this was - in some ways, that kind of wooden roof is an accident waiting to happen.
CHANG: Yeah. That's Caroline Bruzelius. She's a professor emeritus of art history at Duke University. Thank you very much for joining us.
BRUZELIUS: Thank you. Bye-bye. Copyright © 2019 NPR. All rights reserved. Visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.

A fire has broken out in the Notre Dame cathedral in Paris. Flames and smoke were seen billowing high above the cathedral's roof on Monday as the spire collapsed.
AILSA CHANG, HOST:
The Spire of Notre Dame Cathedral has been part of the Parisian skyline for centuries. Today it fell while engulfed in flames. The world stopped to watch the images.
(SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE)
UNIDENTIFIED JOURNALIST #1: At this point, the damage is catastrophic. There is yellow smoke...
UNIDENTIFIED JOURNALIST #2: Know that much of a wooden interior of this 12th century landmark is burning and also likely to be...
UNIDENTIFIED JOURNALIST #3: We're hearing people - Parisians, but also tourists - getting off buses, just standing, staring and crying and weeping and looking at - it went up like a torch.
CHANG: Within sight of the cathedral, people gathered to sing and pray.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
UNIDENTIFIED SINGERS: (Singing in French).
CHANG: We begin our coverage this hour with NPR's Eleanor Beardsley, who's in Paris. Hey, Eleanor.
ELEANOR BEARDSLEY, BYLINE: Hi, Ailsa.
CHANG: So what does the Notre Dame look like right now?
BEARDSLEY: Well, it looks like the fire is out. There's still water shooting up onto the dark church. Now it's nighttime here. And it - the good news is the structure has been saved, the two towers and the facade, says the fire chief. The fire burned for about five hours, and it's still cooling. He says that they're going to be working all night still trying to get artworks out in the smoke and in the falling pieces.
CHANG: Now, this is a cathedral that has been through so much over the centuries. It withstood the French Revolution, two world wars. What are people in Paris saying now as they're taking in what happened today?
BEARDSLEY: Well, it was a surreal scene out there. Thousands of people were on the banks of the Seine River right across from Notre Dame, and that's where I was. People were singing, some were praying, some were kneeling. But everyone was just watching it burn with a stricken look on their face. It was sort of as people were sad and panicked as the flames just would not go out and sometimes appeared to get even bigger. A lot of Parisians were too shaken up to talk to me, but I did speak to 22-year-old Eleanor Mark (ph), and here's what she says.
ELEANOR MARK: (Speaking French).
BEARDSLEY: She says, you know, she's sad. And she says it's a thousand years of history going up in a few hours. She's an architecture student. And she says they studied that cathedral. She knew it very intimately. And she said, it's just terrible to see it go in front of our eyes like this.
CHANG: Now that the fire is under control, what are officials there saying about the scope of the damage and the path forward on how to fix it?
BEARDSLEY: Yeah, exactly. Well, the scope of the damage is massive. The roof is said to be just completely gone. An investigation has been opened by the Paris prosecutor. And, you know, President Macron, he came out to that - to the cathedral tonight. He was supposed to give an important political speech on television. He canceled that. And here he is speaking out in front of Notre Dame.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: (Speaking French).
BEARDSLEY: So he says, you know, Notre Dame is our history, our literature. It's the place where we've lived all of our big moments - our wars, our epidemics, our liberation. He says, it's the epicenter of our life, and together, we're going to rebuild it. He says, that's France's destiny now - to work on Notre Dame together, to come together and rebuild it, and to call on the most talented people to do so.
CHANG: Now, have authorities shared any details so far about how they think this happened, what caused this? Are they investigating? I'm assuming they are.
BEARDSLEY: Yeah. There's an investigation being opened. And I haven't heard officially, but the French media is saying that there is, you know, there was renovation going on near the roof by the ceiling. There was a lot of scaffolding there. And they say that's where the fire broke out. And there was so much, you know, wood and timber in there hundreds of years old. And they say it was, you know, dried and cured and waxed. And it may have been that wood along the ceiling where the fire started. But we'll find out, Ailsa.
CHANG: That's NPR's Eleanor Beardsley. Thank you very much, Eleanor.

‘Razorblades and feathers in my throat’: A fire at a U.S. Steel plant near Pittsburgh made a major polluter even worse,stateimpact.npr.org,Reid Frazier,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://stateimpact.npr.org/pennsylvania/2019/04/15/razorblades-and-feathers-in-my-throat-a-fire-at-a-u-s-steel-plant-near-pittsburgh-made-a-major-polluter-even-worse/,"A reporting project of NPR member stations
U.S. Steel's Clairton Plant, the largest coke works in North America, in Clairton, Pa. Reid R. Frazier / StateImpact Pennsylvania April 15, 2019 | 07:00 AM ‘Razorblades and feathers in my throat’: A fire at a U.S. Steel plant near Pittsburgh made a major polluter even worse The country's largest coke plant was without pollution controls for over three months Reid Frazier Recent Stories Reid R. Frazier is an energy reporter for The Allegheny Front, a Pittsburgh-based public media outlet covering the environment in Pennsylvania. His work has aired on NPR and Marketplace.
The complaint came in on an answering service for the Allegheny County Health Department’s air quality hotline on Dec. 26 at 8:17 p.m.: “SMELL IS VERY BAD CANNOT EVEN LET DOGS OUT”
Another came in later that night, from Squirrel Hill: NEIGHBORHOOD SMELLS OF ROTTEN EGGS
Two days later, a phone call from McKeesport: SMOKE IS FILLING WHOLE VALLEY CLEAR DOWN TO KENNYWOOD. HEAVY AND THICK, SMELLS HORRIBLE.
They kept coming. Over three months, thousands poured in to the health department, by telephone, online, or through a smart phone app.
Complaints obtained from the health department reveal descriptions of an industrial stench wafting over the old milltowns of the Monongahela River valley — “A STRONG ODOR OF SULFUR” or “STRONG BURNING SMELL” — and resulting health effects: “It’s causing coughing for my husband and I,” said one person from Dravosburg on Jan. 3.
The cause was U.S. Steel’s Clairton Plant.
On Christmas Eve , a fire at the plant crippled its air pollution controls. For three months, the Pittsburgh area was blanketed with releases of sulfur dioxide much higher than usual.
For two weeks, the public was largely unaware of the releases. On Jan. 9, after six spikes of pollution above federal air quality standards, the county issued an air alert for the area. Residents criticized the county for the lack of information before the warning.
The county ultimately issued an April 15 deadline to the company to fix its pollution equipment. On April 5, 10 days ahead of schedule, the steelmaker finished its repairs.
But worries about air pollution, and its health impacts, remain.
The Clairton plant is the largest coke works in North America. To make coke, a key component of steelmaking, it bakes coal at high temperatures. The process creates sulfur-rich coke oven gas. The plant normally removes much of that sulfur from its waste stream, but the fire put a temporary halt to that.
To dispose of the gas, before the pollution controls were fixed, the plant flared it at several locations throughout the Mon Valley.
As a result, U.S. Steel emitted more than 70,000 pounds of sulfur dioxide (SO2) a day — five times the amount it’s permitted for, said Jim Kelly, deputy director of environmental health at the Allegheny County Health Department.
“ That’s a lot of pollution. It’s a lot of coke oven gas and so this a large opportunity for excess SO2,” Kelly said. Reid R. Frazier / StateImpact Pennsylvania Doreen Luff, of Jefferson Hills, Pa., with her daughter Katie, 9, and son Jimmy, 6, in their back yard overlooking US Steel’s Clairton Coke Works.
“It’s a pretty acrid smell. The problem with sulfur dioxide is, in the air, in the presence of water, it forms sulfuric acid. So you can just imagine what that does when you breathe it into your lungs.”
What it does is burn the nose and throat , obstruct airway passages, and make it hard to breathe.
From her back yard on top of a hill, Doreen Luff can see the Clairton Plant — and smell it.
“When the wind blows, it blows the sulfur up here pretty good,” she says.
Since moving to her house in the community of Jefferson Hills 12 years ago, Luff could always smell the plant, some days worse than others. But after the fire, things got worse. On warm days, she keeps her windows closed.
Her kids’ schools stopped outdoor recess on bad air days. And in January, her 9-year-old daughter Katie got asthma. Luff blames the plant.
“She’s never been sick like that before, but now she has asthma. She has to use an inhaler,” Luff said. “I get nauseous, I have headaches, constant dizziness.”
She’s not alone. Her neighbor, Reita Derrick, says the air has made her cough: “It feels like I have at the same time razorblades and feathers in my throat.”
Another neighbor, Christa Gaugler, said her kids complained of sore throats and burning eyes. Gaugler said after the fire she experienced a “thickness” in the back of her throat, “a nasty taste that will not go away.”
Jacob Fleming, of Glassport, said he started wheezing after riding his bike. “I’ve never had any issues breathing. I feel like I have asthma now,” he said. Reid R. Frazier / StateImpact Pennsylvania Inside Doreen Luff’s house in Jefferson Hills, Pa.
Environmental groups and angry residents criticized the health department for not doing enough to protect air quality after the fire. But Kelly says the agency did what it could, within the bounds of the law.
Kelly said the department couldn’t just order the plant to close down while it fixed those controls because he didn’t think a judge would allow it. That’s because coke ovens need to stay hot, or else they break down.
“To replace a coke oven is about $500 million,” Kelly said. “That’s something a judge will take into consideration if we order them to cease operation.”
In February, the county tried to order U.S. Steel to put the plant on a hot idle — where the plant stays hot, but produces no coke. The agency backed down when it learned that U.S. Steel said it would have taken longer to put the plant on idle than to just repair its pollution controls. Reid R. Frazier / StateImpact Pennsylvania A flare at US Steel’s Irvin Works overlooks the town of Glassport, Pa.
One of U.S. Steel’s flares overlooks the nearby town of Glassport. Outside the Dollar Tree there where she works, Jennifer Magura said the air was so bad she got bronchitis this winter.
“I have a rescue inhaler and I’ve been using it, like, nonstop,” she said. “I mean, I already emptied two in the last two weeks and it’s just hard to breathe.”
Magura is a smoker, but says the kinds of breathing problems she’s had this winter are different.
“ I’ve smoked all my life, so I know what that’s like and I know when things are worse than usual, because when I go to downtown Pittsburgh I’m not struggling as much to breathe. And that’s like in the same day.”
But some aren’t so bothered by the plant’s air pollution, as long as it is providing jobs. Hilda Lueckert of Clairton said she couldn’t really smell anything different in the air. She’s lived in Clairton all her life, and her son works at the plant.
“Well, everything needs to be cleaned up. They do have to follow (environmental) guidelines. But as long as there’s smoke comin’ out of there, I know the men are going to have their jobs. So…I don’t have any complaints about it.”
The Clairton plant employs 1,200, and supports another 1,800 jobs at two other U.S. Steel mills nearby.
Lueckert remembers the days when the air was so bad in Clairton you couldn’t see your hand in front of your face. The plant is much cleaner than in those days, she said. U.S. Steel said it’s already spent $37 million in pollution controls since 2016, and is spending $65 million more to improve those controls. The company reported profits of $1.15 billion in 2018.

“Give them a chance to work on it,” she said. “Instead of shutting everything down, and having all these men out of a job. Give them a chance to improve it.”
Back at her home in Jefferson Hills, Doreen Luff says she’s thought about moving, but she doesn’t think her family can afford to right now. Her husband Bryan works for Verizon and she’s a stay-at-home mom.
“ I talked about moving, but I think we’re financially unable to,” she said. “So we’re kind of stuck here like a lot of people are.”
Her 9 year old daughter, Katie, said on some days, she has tried to hold her breath when she goes outside to wait for the bus.
“And I’m not really good at holding my breath,” she said. “It kind of smells like sulfur. I don’t, I don’t like that…I don’t like it at all.”
Luff is glad the mill has put the pollution controls back on, but she says some days the air is still unbearable. She hopes her headaches go away, and that her daughter’s breathing gets better, eventually."
The Losers And Winners Of The Trump Administration's Big Tax Cut : NPR,www.npr.org,Jim Zarroli,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/15/713616898/the-losers-and-winners-of-the-trump-administrations-big-tax-cut,"It's tax day and many Americans are finding out whether last year's big tax overhaul really did cut their taxes. Most did, but some people saw their tax bill go up considerably.
AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:
For most Americans, this is the day when federal income taxes are due. 2018 was the first year in which the Trump administration's big tax cut took effect. The bill lowered taxes for most people, but not for everyone. NPR's Jim Zarroli looks at who the winners and losers are.
JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: The 2017 tax cut was President Trump's biggest legislative accomplishment to date. It sharply lowered the corporate tax rate and allowed businesses to bring home the money they made overseas tax-free. But it also cut taxes on people. Here was Trump in his 2018 State of the Union address.
(SOUNDBITE OF 2018 STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS)
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Millions of Americans will have more take-home pay starting next month - a lot more.
ZARROLI: And that was true. Mark Mazur of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center says people at every part of the income spectrum benefited at least a little from Trump's tax cut.
MARK MAZUR: Low-income families with children might see a tax cut of $50 or $100 a year. In the middle-income categories, the tax cuts would be several hundred dollars.
ZARROLI: And he says high-end taxpayers may have saved thousands, or even tens of thousands of dollars. Though Trump initially promised that rich people would be hurt by his tax bill, they weren't, says former Obama administration official David Kamin.
DAVID KAMIN: Those at the top are not paying, on average, more because of this bill. Quite the opposite - they're getting a disproportionate amount of this tax cut.
ZARROLI: Still, most people - some two-thirds of American taxpayers - got a tax cut, says Mark Mazur. But Mazur says there's a problem for Republicans.
MAZUR: I think a lot of Americans don't really seem to feel that tax cut.
ZARROLI: In surveys done over the past year, most Americans say they don't think they benefited from the cut, even when they did. David Kamin says the tax cut kind of got lost.
KAMIN: For middle- to low-income Americans, the tax cut was not all that large. It was then spread out over time as, you know, they would just get a somewhat bigger paycheck immediately.
ZARROLI: As a result, a lot of people didn't even realize they got a tax cut. The bill also created some geographic winners and losers. It sharply cut the amount of money people could deduct for state and local taxes, which hurt millions of people in high-tax states, such as New Jersey and California.
KAMIN: That's not the vast majority of Americans, but there are a relatively small number who do immediately face a tax increase under the bill.
ZARROLI: And it barred taxpayers from deducting business expenses, such as computer software or magazine subscriptions. The Tax Policy Center says about 6 percent of Americans saw their taxes rise as a result of the bill. And Kamin says the bill will have another harmful effect.
KAMIN: When you begin to think through what this tax bill means over the long term, it becomes clear this is likely to leave most Americans worse off.
ZARROLI: He says the tax cut has meant less revenue coming into the government. The federal debt is growing. That will have to be paid eventually, either through higher taxes or cuts in government services. And there's one more unpleasant fact. Under the tax bill, the cuts for individuals are set to expire after 2025. So unless Congress decides to extend them, people will end up paying more once again.

Microplastic Found Even In The Air In France's Pyrenees Mountains : NPR,www.npr.org,Christopher Joyce,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/15/713561484/microplastic-found-even-in-the-air-in-frances-pyrenees-mountains,"Microplastic Found Even In The Air In France's Pyrenees Mountains Microplastic Found Even In The Air In France's Pyrenees Mountains Embed Embed

VW Pics/UIG via Getty Images
Surprisingly high amounts of microplastic are raining down on a remote and seemingly pristine part of France's Pyrenees mountains, according to scientists who say such particles could potentially be floating everywhere.
Microplastic — fragments smaller than a fifth of an inch that have broken down from larger pieces of plastic — has been found in rivers, lakes, the oceans and in agricultural soil. But very few studies of wind-borne microplastic have ever been done. This one found that the air over these mountains has about as much floating plastic pollution as the air over Paris or Dongguan, a large industrial city in China.
Steve Allen, a researcher at the University of Strathclyde in Scotland, was part of the team that dreamed up the Pyrenees experiment.
""I don't know if you've ever seen a plastic bag on a fence flapping away until it disappears,"" he says. ""Well, we thought that maybe it just doesn't disappear, so we started looking for it a bit higher up.""
Higher up meaning 4,500 feet up a mountain. Allen's team set up collectors there for five months to trap plastic particles as they fell to Earth. ""We expected to find some,"" Allen says. ""We didn't expect to find quite as much as we did.""
In fact, they found 365 plastic particles on average every day on a square meter collector. ""We'd kind of expected it in a city getting blown around,"" he says, ""but way up there? The number is astounding.""
Writing in the journal Nature Geoscience , the researchers found several types of microplastic floating on the wind in the Pyrenees: fibers from clothing, and bits from plastic bags, plastic film and packaging material.

And apparently, it isn't local. Only a few small villages lie within 60 miles of the study site.
Scientists know how dust gets blown — say, from the Sahara across the Atlantic – but they ""know basically nothing about how [microplastics] move,"" says Deonie Allen of the French institution EcoLab, who worked with Steve Allen on the research and is married to him.
""We don't have this sort of material in nature,"" Deonie Allen says, noting that microplastics come in different shapes and are of different densities, which might affect how long they remain wind-borne. The researchers suspect that rain or snow carries some particles down to the ground, but they don't need precipitation to fall to earth.
Allen says that if this much microplastic manages to get halfway up the Pyrenees mountains, it could theoretically be everywhere, floating hundreds of miles from its original source.
And some microplastics probably can be inhaled. ""We ...don't know what they do to humans,"" Allen says. ""They're a brand new [type of] pollution, but there's so much of it and it's increasing so fast that it's something we really need to start learning about.""
Chelsea Rochman , a plastics researcher at the University of Toronto, has found microplastic as far away from civilization as the Arctic. She says this new study shows that ""our use of plastic materials and the way we dispose of them has led to global contamination of more than just populated areas.""
In fact, she says, ""plastic pollution may be the marker of our time."" "
Writer Elaina Plott Looks 'Inside Ivanka Trump's Dreamworld' For 'The Atlantic',www.npr.org,,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/15/713616952/writer-elaina-plott-looks-inside-ivanka-trump-s-dreamworld-for-the-atlantic,"NPR's Audie Cornish talks with Elaina Plott of The Atlantic, about Ivanka Trump and how her image and personal brand have come under deep scrutiny during her father's presidency.
AILSA CHANG, HOST:
First daughter and senior adviser to the president Ivanka Trump is in Africa today, pushing her message of women's empowerment. Before she left, Trump reminded people to take advantage of an expanded child tax credit, another Trump administration policy she has supported.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
IVANKA TRUMP: Through tax reform, we fought hard for the American working family. In 2019, as you fill out your taxes and you check the box for the child tax credit, you will have a doubled child tax credit. And...
CHANG: Empowering women and helping working families are a big part of the personal brand Ivanka Trump built for herself before her father entered politics. That personal brand gave rise to what Atlantic writer Elaina Plott describes as the founding myth of Ivanka Trump.
ELAINA PLOTT: I consider the founding myth to be this notion that not only Ivanka Trump but also her husband, Jared Kushner, would come into the White House and be moderating influences of sorts. Throughout the campaign, we saw Trump advocating for things such as a border wall, other controversial immigration policies. And there was always this sense that he would never actually follow through on those things because somebody like Ivanka would ensure that he never did.
AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:
The president did act on those campaign promises, including pulling out of the Paris climate accord, something his daughter lobbied against. That move put to rest the idea that his daughter and her husband would be a moderating influence. And it made it harder for his daughter to find her footing in his administration. Elaina Plott has written about all that in her new piece, ""Inside Ivanka's Dreamworld"" (ph). She and I spoke about this earlier today.
When I think about ""SNL"" making fun of her with their skit - I think it was a perfume company called Complicit...
PLOTT: Yeah.
(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, ""SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE"")
UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As narrator) A scent made just for her. Because she's beautiful. She's powerful. She's Complicit.
CORNISH: But I also think of the fact that, like, my mom sent me a copy of her book, you know, a few years back. Can you talk about the shift in public perception of her more broadly and how she's reacted to that?
PLOTT: Definitely. Back before her father announced that he was running for president, she was somebody who was really well liked by a lot of women across America. I note in the piece that I was one of them. I followed her on Instagram, like many of my girlfriends. We saw her as somebody who was empowering women, who kind of had it all, as it were. She was a mother. She ran this multi-million-dollar company. Because of that, I think that is where the founding myth of a moderating force took place - because a lot of people were so kind of taken aback by Trump's presidency and what it could mean for this country, that because that favorable impression of Ivanka lingered, people were willing to project onto her what maybe they wanted her father to do.
And that's why I think something like the ""SNL"" ad, you know, came to light. It's not necessarily that Ivanka is complicit. It's that that fact was surprising to people, that she might not, in fact, disagree with her father. So I remember in that ""SNL"" skit, at one point - it's Scarlett Johansson - and she said, for the woman who could stop all of this, but won't.
(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, ""SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE"")
UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As narrator) Complicit, the fragrance for the woman who could stop all of this, but won't.
PLOTT: And I think that Americans have to take a critical look at themselves and ask, why did I think she ever would stop it?
CORNISH: Although, your article seems to have the thesis that she can't.
PLOTT: I think that's right. I think that her father treasures her opinion very much. But he's also somebody who is really infatuated with his own opinion on issues. And even though I do think that he takes his daughter's thoughts into consideration in a way that he wouldn't any other senior adviser, ultimately he's going to do precisely what he wants to do.
CORNISH: So now she is here in Washington, working in the White House. And she has not been able to separate her brand, so to speak, from his. Here she is responding to questions about sexual assault allegations against her father. It's in an interview with Peter Alexander. It was on NBC. This was back in February of 2018.
(SOUNDBITE OF NBC BROADCAST)
PETER ALEXANDER: Do you believe your father's accusers?
TRUMP: I think it's a pretty inappropriate question to ask a daughter if she believes the accusers of her father when he's affirmatively stated that there's no truth to it. I don't think that's a question you would ask many other daughters. I believe my father. I know my father. So I - I think I have that right, as a daughter, to believe my father.
CORNISH: Can you talk about how this reflects the difficulty maybe she's had as she's been confronted with questions about her father's either behavior or policy?
PLOTT: I'm so glad you played that clip because, you know, one of the reasons that in the past people were willing to ascribe Ivanka the benefit of the doubt is she was not - she was not working for her father, necessarily. She was in The Trump Organization. But she was most known for her lifestyle brand. But when she started to become a senior adviser to her father in the White House, she was no longer just a daughter. She was somebody who implicitly, by virtue of her employment status, endorsed what was going on in this White House and would necessarily have to confront questions that a senior adviser has to expect to be asked about.
CORNISH: There is a perception of what does this woman do all day - right? - from the general public. Is that something you heard from people in the White House as well? What's the response?
PLOTT: Their impression is that she kind of shows up some days just to be seen. At the same time, I do think that a lot of those perceptions are unfair. Whatever you think about what Ivanka does or doesn't believe, she - she does work during the day. She shows up at senior staff meetings at 7 to 8 a.m. and is usually there throughout the day. She travels often to meet with workers as part of her workforce development initiative. But again, she's not somebody like her husband, even, who, when there is kind of a momentous debate taking place, she is not putting herself in the room and asserting herself anymore.
CORNISH: She is not asserting herself anymore. What do you think has changed? When did that shift happen?
PLOTT: The Paris climate accord - I cannot emphasize enough how pivotal that was for Ivanka Trump in terms of realizing the limits of her influence in these key policy debates. You know, she lobbied so ardently for the United States to stay in that accord.
CORNISH: Directly to the president.
PLOTT: Exactly, and personally encouraged people like Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, to call her father and urge him to stay in because that, to her, was so emblematic of what her crowd back in New York wanted. And when it failed, her response was to kind of look out for No. 1, retreat and say, what are things that I feel I could actually get my hands around and be judged by in a more favorable light.
CORNISH: In the end, why does it matter? Why do you think that this particular figure - there have been lots of White House children, so to speak, right? And they've been kind of off-limits, in a way. What's significant about her and her role?
PLOTT: What I think is significant about Ivanka Trump is that I see her as somebody who will want to be part of the national political conversation well after this White House is over. I see her as somebody who would have her eye on something like the World Bank or the United Nations. She is seen as somebody who doesn't necessarily view her father's presidency as a one-off but could maybe see her father as the catalyst for a Trump political dynasty. And so if she wants that to happen, it's incumbent, I think, on the public to understand as much as we can about who she is and what she stands for.
CORNISH: Elaina Plott, she covers the White House for The Atlantic. Thank you for sharing your reporting with us.
PLOTT: Thank you, Audie.

From big papers to small, famous authors to unknowns, the Pulitzer Prizes cover the map of American writing and music.
AILSA CHANG, HOST:
The 2019 Pulitzer Prizes were announced in New York today. They award achievements in journalism and in the Arts and Letters. As NPR's Andrew Limbong reports this year's awards turn the spotlight on some of the dangers journalists around the world faced.
ANDREW LIMBONG, BYLINE: Dana Canedy, the administrator of the prizes, broke with tradition this year by opening the awards with a special recognition for the Eagle Eye. That's the school newspaper for Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, which submitted the obituaries for 17 people who were killed during the shooting at the school.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
DANA CANEDY: These budding journalists remind us of the media's unwavering commitment to bearing witness, even in the most wrenching of circumstances, in service to a nation whose very existence depends on a free and dedicated press.
LIMBONG: The most wrenching of circumstances affected many of the newsrooms named, including the South Florida Sun-Sentinel, which won a public service award for its coverage of the Parkland shooting. The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette won for its breaking news coverage of the Tree of Life synagogue shooting in that city. And a special citation was given to the staff of the Capital Gazette in Annapolis.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
CANEDY: For their courageous response to the largest killing of journalists in U.S. history in their newsroom on June 28, 2018, and for demonstrating unflagging commitment to covering the news and serving their community at a time of unspeakable grief.
LIMBONG: The New York Times was given an award for explanatory reporting for its work digging into the finances of President Donald Trump and his father, Fred. Here's Times writer David Barstow.
DAVID BARSTOW: Central to Donald Trump's narrative is that I am a self-made billionaire. And I know people have been skeptical about that for a long time. But what we were able to do with this body of work was we were able to document nearly 300 specific revenue streams that Fred Trump created specifically for the benefit of Donald Trump over his lifetime. Our story, in effect, rewrites the financial biography of our 45th president.
LIMBONG: As far as local reporting goes, The Advocate out of Baton Rouge, La., was awarded a Pulitzer for tracing a law back to 1890s during Jim Crow that allows non-unanimous juries to convict, including life sentences.
GORDON RUSSELL: And the idea seems to be that if one or two black people managed to get on a jury, they could still be ignored.
LIMBONG: Gordon Russell is the managing editor for investigations at The Advocate. He says that the law has serious implications for today.
RUSSELL: We found that 40 percent of the verdicts that ended in conviction were non-unanimous.
LIMBONG: Some of the winners in Arts and Letters also spoke to serious subjects. Richard Powers won the Fiction Prize for his novel, ""The Overstory,"" which is about a group of people trying to save trees on the verge of destruction. He told NPR last year that he was looking to foster a reverence for the environment.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)
RICHARD POWERS: What a tree can do to transform the atmosphere to transform the soil is absolutely part of the story of humans trying to give to these huge, ancient, incredibly diverse and incredibly supple creatures the same kind of sanctity that we reserve exclusively for ourselves.
LIMBONG: Forrest Gander was awarded the Poetry Prize for ""Be With,"" a collection grappling with loss and grief. Playwright Jackie Sibblies Drury won the Drama Prize for her play, ""Fairview,"" which on its face is about a black family planning a birthday party, but as she told the Berkeley Repertory Theatre last year, is, in practice, about surveillance.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
JACKIE SIBBLIES DRURY: Thinking about why surveillance feels more dangerous to people of color because of, like, the implicit bias around the people that are actually doing the surveilling.
LIMBONG: But the prizes this year were not just about the tragedies and hardships of the world around us, but giving due to the people who faced them and created joy, as noted by another special citation being given to the late Aretha Franklin. Andrew Limbong, NPR News.

"Without Using Profanity, Supreme Court Justices Discuss Case Centered On Bad Language",www.npr.org,npr.org,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/15/713616864/without-using-profanity-supreme-court-justices-discuss-case-centered-on-bad-lang,"Without Using Profanity, Supreme Court Justices Discuss Case Centered On Bad Language Without Using Profanity, Supreme Court Justices Discuss Case Centered On Bad Language Embed Embed
The Supreme Court heard arguments on a case examining whether the clothing brand F-U-C-T is profane or could be trademarked.
AILSA CHANG, HOST:
At the Supreme Court today, the issue was bad language. Specifically, can the government refuse to grant trademark protection for brand names that include profanity? The immediate problem for the court was how to discuss the issue without using the actual words - how to discuss the F-word, for instance, without actually saying the F-word, which is a challenge that NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg faces in this report.
NINA TOTENBERG, BYLINE: At the center of the case is a casual clothing line marketed under the name F-U-C-T. You can pronounce it yourself. The line, designed by Erik Brunetti, is mainly hoodies, loose pants, shorts and T-shirts all with those letters prominently displayed. Brunetti opened his line in 1990 aimed at 20-somethings. He's been trying since then to get his brand, FUCT, trademarked so that he can go after copycats.
ERIK BRUNETTI: Go to eBay, and you'll see lots of counterfeits. Or go to Amazon. You'll see a lot - lots of counterfeits.
TOTENBERG: In short, he says, the knockoffs are costing him money.
BRUNETTI: If I win, I will pursue the counterfeiters to stop them from making my product.
TOTENBERG: The U.S. government Patent and Trademark Office, however, has consistently turned him down, contending that those letters violate the federal statute that bars trademark protection for immoral, shocking, offensive and scandalous words. Brunetti's case got a boost two years ago when the Supreme Court ruled that an Asian-American band calling itself The Slants could not be denied trademark protection because it used a disparaging term.
Dealing with the brand name FUCT proved a bit more daunting in the Supreme Court chamber today. Deputy Solicitor General Malcolm Stewart referred to it as, quote, ""a profane past-participle form of a well-known word of profanity and perhaps the paradigmatic word of profanity in our language."" The government, he maintained, can deny trademark protection for that word. The justices pointed to a chart showing which terms had been granted trademarks by the government and which had not. Most are not suitable for a general audience. Suffice to say that while FUCT did not win trademark approval, FCUK did, and so did the well-known brand FUBAR. The word crap was registered in a trademark name 70 times, but the S-word was consistently denied.
So, Justice Ginsburg asked, how does the Trademark Office define what is scandalous, shocking or offensive? Do 20-year-olds generally find FUCT to be shocking or scandalous? Probably not, conceded the government's Stewart. But he said the term would still be shocking or offensive to a substantial segment of the population. Justice Gorsuch pointed to the chart, declaring that it was hard to see why certain trademarks with dirty words were approved and others were denied.
Justice Alito asked what would happen when really dirty words were at issue. And how about racial slurs, asked Justice Breyer. Those are more like swear words. They're insults that sting and are remembered by those who were targeted. Stewart replied that because of the court's decision in The Slants' case, most racial slurs are now approved. But as for the most offensive slur, the N-word, for now, it's still out.
Representing FUCT designer Brunetti, lawyer John Sommer didn't have an easy time either. Justice Breyer - why doesn't the government have the right to say you can use this language in your brand name, but the government doesn't want to be associated with it by granting trademark protection? What I'm worried about, he said, is that if a racial slur is trademarked, it will appear as a product name on every bus where it's advertised. It'll be on newsstands where children and others will see it. That's not the audience Mr. Brunetti is appealing to, replied lawyer Sommer. Chief Justice Roberts - but that may not be the only audience he reaches.
Lawyer Sommer returned to the language of the statute, arguing that if offensiveness is the standard for turning down a trademark, Steak 'n Shake can't be registered either because, quote, ""a substantial portion of Americans believe that eating beef is immoral."" A decision in the case is expected by summer.

Bernie Sanders Releases A Decade Of Tax Returns,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/15/712739155/bernie-sanders-releases-a-decade-of-tax-returns,"Enlarge this image Democratic presidential candidate Sen.

Scott Olson/Getty Images Updated at 7:26 p.m. ET
Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders released 10 years' worth of tax returns Monday. The documents underscore how much money the populist presidential candidate has earned in recent years, as his public profile has risen.
In an interview with the New York Times before the returns were made public, Sanders dismissed the idea that his newfound wealth undercut his billionaire-bashing message.
""I wrote a bestselling book,"" he told the paper . ""If you write a bestselling book, you can be a millionaire, too.""
The tax returns show that Sanders earned more than $1 million recently, making $1,131,925 in 2017 between himself and his wife, Jane, and paying a total of $343,882 in taxes at a 30 percent tax rate. Most of the money came in connection with the book Sanders wrote after his 2016 bid, Where We Go From Here . That year, their adjusted gross income was $1,062,626, and they paid a total of $372,368 in taxes at a 35 percent tax rate.
But the royalties from that book have slowed, and in 2018 Sanders and his wife made $561,293. The two paid $145,840 in taxes, or a 26 percent tax rate, and also gave 3.4 percent of their income to charity, donating $18,950.
Politics Democratic Candidates Are Releasing Tax Returns, Answering Big Questions For Voters During the 2016 presidential primary, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton pressured Sanders to release his tax returns. He eventually made his 2014 return public: The document showed he and Jane earned about $206,000 that year, including Social Security benefits.
It's been standard for major-party nominees to release their tax returns, but in 2016, Trump became the first general-election candidate in more than four decades to keep his private. Trump has continued to ignore calls to release them, and House Democrats are now trying to use their majority power to obtain the documents from the Internal Revenue Service.
Politics Treasury Department Misses House Committee Deadline To Turn Over Trump Tax Returns As Democrats continue to hammer Trump on the issue, several presidential candidates have made a point of releasing their own financial information earlier than presidential hopefuls have in past campaigns.
After Sanders put out the past decade of his taxes, former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke did the same on Monday evening, though without his 2018 return — which he hadn't filed yet but said he would make public as soon as he did. In 2017, he and wife Amy's adjusted gross income was $366,455, and they paid a total of $81,019 in taxes for a 22 percent tax rate. They gave $1,166 to charity, meaning they had a 0.3 percent giving rate — the lowest by far of any 2020 hopeful.
Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Kamala Harris of California, as well as Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, have all already made their 2018 tax returns public.
So far, those have shown that Harris and her husband made the most money, paid the most in taxes and were taxed at the highest rate.
Warren was the most generous.

(SOUNDBITE OF BIRD CHIRPING)
ROTT: ...Would not be much to look at or play in. You'd be lucky if you could float a soda can down it. Though looking at its brush-tangled banks in downtown Santa Fe, it looks like a few people have tried. Its springtime runoff is more trickle than torrent. But to folks like Rachel Conn, this is impressive.
RACHEL CONN: This is, like, flow in New Mexico. This is - a lot of creatures depend on something like this.
ROTT: Conn is with Amigos Bravos, New Mexico-based conservation group that focuses on water issues.
CONN: Up to 94 percent of our waters are these smaller types of waters that flow only part of the year. But they all drain into our bigger systems. And it is from these bigger systems that close to 300,000 New Mexicans receive their drinking water.
ROTT: And it's these types of smaller rivers and streams that may soon lose federal protections. The Trump administration's new proposed definition of which waters should fall under the Clean Water Act does not include ephemeral or intermittent streams - waterways that only flow after precipitation like the Santa Fe, or, say, every other year, which isn't all that uncommon in the arid Southwest. That means industry or landowners looking to discharge wastewater into one of those or dam one of those streams would no longer need a federal permit to do so.
HELEN NEVILLE: So it's millions of miles of stream.
ROTT: Helen Neville is the senior scientist for the conservation and sportsmen's group Trout Unlimited, an organization that opposes the new rule. The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that about 18 percent of streams nationwide and half of the country's wetlands would no longer be considered waters of the United States under the president's proposal. Trout Unlimited believes it's far more because ephemeral streams are so hard to map and so easily overlooked.
NEVILLE: You know, it's very similar to how you think about your capillaries feeding your blood vessels.
ROTT: Ephemeral streams may seem insignificant.
NEVILLE: But they're critically important for the health of those downstream waters just like your capillaries are critically important for the health of your blood system.
ROTT: And she says that's especially true in the southwest, where rains can be few and far between. Even the Rio Grande, New Mexico's biggest river, ran dry in parts last year. Chad Smith, CEO of the New Mexico Farm and Livestock Bureau, is less worried about the impact on the state's waterways and doesn't believe that it will lead to a surge in pollution from industries like his, something environmental groups have warned about.
CHAD SMITH: We want to make sure our waterways are clean. We want to make sure we protect our natural resources that we make a living off of.
ROTT: He says industry groups around the country are applauding the proposed change.
SMITH: It couldn't be more welcomed. I think what it does from a very high-level perspective is it provides some more clarity and certainty for farmers and ranchers across the landscape.
ROTT: Clarity and certainty are the reasons the Trump administration is giving, too. The EPA says they want to make it clear for landowners and developers whether federal laws apply to a project or not. Conflicting court decisions have made that muddy in the past. And it's likely that courts will get another say about this change. Nathan Rott, NPR News, Santa Fe, N.M.

toggle caption Johannes Eisele/AFP/Getty Images A nurse prepares the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine at the Rockland County Health Department in Haverstraw, N.Y. Several measles outbreaks in New York state are contributing to this year's unusually high measles rates.
Johannes Eisele/AFP/Getty Images Measles is surging. Last week the U.S. recorded 90 cases, making this year's outbreak the second largest in more than two decades.
So far this year, the U.S. has confirmed 555 measles cases, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced Monday. That's 50 percent higher than the total number recorded last year, even though we're only about a quarter of the way through 2019.
And the virus isn't slowing down.
""The number of cases is accelerating,"" says Dr. Amanda Cohn, a senior adviser for vaccines at the CDC. ""We are on track to have one of the highest numbers of cases of measles reported since we eliminated the disease in the year 2000.""
The majority of the cases are connected to outbreaks in New York, Cohn says.
""This is a very significant outbreak,"" she says. ""These cases were imported from other countries, but because of low vaccination coverage in these communities, measles is spreading widely throughout these communities.""

Last week, New York City declared a public health emergency in an ultra-Orthodox community in the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn. The city's Health Department is mandating that parents vaccinate their children, or they may face a $1,000 fine.
The CDC pointed to four other places with ongoing outbreaks in the U.S.: Clark County, Wash. ; Oakland County, Mich.; two counties in New Jersey ; and a handful of counties across California .
Health officials say there are two main reasons for the virus's surge: more international travel and lower vaccination rates.
Several countries around the world are currently experiencing massive measles outbreaks. Madagascar has recorded more than 100,000 cases since the fall, with more than 1,200 deaths. Ukraine has recorded about 37,000 cases this year. And the European Union is tallying about 1,000 cases a month.
Globally, the World Health Organization reports that measles cases in the first quarter of 2019 nearly quadrupled compared with what was reported at this time last year.
More American families are bringing measles home with them after traveling abroad, Cohn says. And once the disease lands stateside, it has a better chance of gaining a foothold because vaccination rates in some places have dropped below 93 to 95 percent, the threshold required to protect the entire community.
""When you make the decision not to vaccinate your child, please understand you're also making that decision for the people around your child,"" New York City's deputy mayor of health and human services, Herminia Palacio, told NPR on Wednesday .
Measles can be an extremely serious disease. About 25 percent of infected children are hospitalized. About 10 percent of children develop ear infections, which can cause permanent hearing damage. In about 1 in 1,000 cases, the infection becomes life-threatening. In these cases, the virus moves to the brain, causing encephalitis and convulsions. Children can be left deaf, blind or with intellectual disabilities — if they recover.
Before the development of the measles vaccine in the 1960s, the U.S. recorded nearly a half-million cases each year , the CDC says. About 48,000 kids were hospitalized and about 500 people died per year.
""We eliminated measles from this country in 2000, and ... I think we eliminated the memory of that virus,"" Dr. Paul Offit of Children's Hospital of Philadelphia told NPR's Weekend Edition Sunday . ""People don't remember how sick it could make you."""

Oli Scarff/Getty Images
Alan Rusbridger knows a thing or two about high-stakes journalism.
During his 20-year tenure running the British newspaper The Guardian , he collaborated with NSA contractor Edward Snowden and WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange on blockbuster stories drawn from secret government documents. Though Rusbridger left The Guardian in 2015, he remembers the stress vividly.
""We were publishing every minute of the day around the world,"" he says. ""It's a matter of deadlines and never enough information and people trying to sue you and generally harass you."" Full Cache Of Unredacted WikiLeaks Diplomatic Cables Is Now Online
And just as The Guardian was covering these massive stories, Rusbridger was also dealing with serious challenges to the journalism industry itself. While many newspapers at the time were establishing paywalls, under Rusbridger's watch, The Guardian created an economic model in which online users were asked — but not required — to pay for the newspaper's content. It's a model that seems to be working.
""Last week, my successor's editor announced they now had a million readers who are now contributing to The Guardian in order to keep it open to everybody,"" Rusbridger says. ""I think that's rather miraculous. It's called philanthropy, and that people want to be philanthropic about news is amazingly encouraging.""
Rusbridger now serves as chair of the steering committee at the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism. His new book is Breaking News: The Remaking of Journalism and Why it Matters Now. The Remaking of Journalism and Why It Matters Now Author Interview Highlights
On the decision to publish classified information provided by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden
We have the Pentagon Papers case of 1971 to thank for the fact that it established a ruling at the Supreme Court that said that the government can't walk into a newsroom and injunct them and prevent them from publishing. You can certainly hold an editor responsible in retrospect, but you can't stop them from publishing, unless you can show overwhelming cause. Now, in Britain we don't have that, and I always suspected with the Snowden story that there might come a point where the government would walk into the Guardian offices and prevent us from publishing — and that's exactly what they did.
In fact, they demanded that we smashed all the computers on which we were storing this material. But I also knew that, again, [with] a partnership with The New York Times, that the First Amendment and the effect of the Pentagon Papers ruling meant that the American government could never do that, and it was a much more permissive environment to publish out of New York than out of London, sadly.
On the U.K. government's destruction of Guardian computers because of the Snowden story Pentagon Papers Leaker Daniel Ellsberg Praises Snowden, Manning
It turns out that it's remarkably difficult todamage a computer so that it's of no use to anybody else. It involved a very elaborate, dusty, noisy morning in the basement of the Guardia n with drills and angled drivers and ... all kinds of weird equipment destroying specific chips and bits of the keyboard, bits of the hard drive, and bits of the memory board under the watchful eye of GCHQ [the Government Communications Headquarters]. That's the equivalent of the NSA technicians.
It seemed to me a piece of theater, because I had told them that we had a copy in New York with The New York Times and with Pro Publica . And so this was not going to stop our reporting, but it seemed like a piece of theater to be able to say to somebody, ""Look, we've smashed up The Guardian 's computers,"" and somebody would feel better. ...
In the modern world, it is very difficult to prevent good information (and sadly, bad information) ... from being published, because it's like water, and you can't you can't control it in the way that you could even 50 years ago.
On what it was like working with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange WikiLeaks' Assange Arrested In London
Assange and Snowden are often bracketed together as though they're the same; in fact, they're almost opposite. If you think what Edward Snowden did was to hand over his material to journalists, three or four journalists including The Washington Post, and said ""You choose,"" and once he handed it over he played no part in any of the editorial decisions.
Assange is, I think of as an information anarchist. He doesn't really like journalism or journalists, and he doesn't believe in the idea of gatekeepers, of people who are the arbiters on society's behalf, of what they read or not. So his instinct was just to dump all the information out there and people could read it and make their minds up.
They're obviously very different approaches and he was a difficult man to work with for that reason, because we thought we should be redacting and reading for libel and for potential damage, and for many dangers on our horizons. So in the end, I did think we were the only people in the world who have fallen out with Julian Assange, but it became an impossible relationship.
On crowdsourcing criticism
We had a wonderful theater critic called Michael Billington, who had been on the staff since 1972, and we always wanted Michael to be in the stalls on the first night of a big production. But would anybody think that out of 900 people in the audience he was the only person with an interesting opinion? No. Nobody would argue that today. And would it be interesting to hear from some of those 900? Well, of course ... 30 people might want to do that, but you would then have 30 different views. What would happen if Michael then had a dialogue with those 30 people? They could see things that he didn't, and vice-versa.
It is that idea of involving different voices in the act of criticism — is [that] a terrible idea? Is that a good idea? If we don't do it, someone else will. Then you get back into the ethos of the four billion people talking to each other, which has to be a powerful idea. Otherwise, all these people wouldn't be doing it. These were our attempts to fumble towards an idea of what we call ""open journalism.""
On how social media can influence journalism for the better
Journalism has to remake itself if it is to be the answer to the world of information chaos that we're in danger of living in. Alan Rusbridger There's much that is wrong with journalism, and journalism in many ways hasn't come to terms with a new age of the democratizing of news. ... Journalism has to remake itself if it is to be the answer to the world of information chaos that we're in danger of living in. ... You might think that at this time, of all times, people will turn to journalists. ... Whereas in fact, all the polls on trust show that journalists are not generally trusted. So I think you have to say how would we regain trust? And I think it's not enough just to say, ""We're journalists, trust us."" I think social media has some answers.
If you look at the best of social media you have some very good, intelligent, funny, expert people who are talking to each other and listening to each other and responding to each other. They don't say, ""Trust me,"" they say, ""Here's my evidence. Here's my link. Here's my screengrab. This is how I know, but if I'm wrong, tell me."" And it's a different kind of information sharing and a different kind of dialogue from the printing press model, which is, ""Here is the paper and we essentially are not very interested in hearing from you.""

Steven Senne/AP Actress Lori Loughlin and her fashion designer husband, Mossimo Giannulli, entered not guilty pleas Monday in federal court in Boston.
Both waived their right to appear in court for arraignment.
Federal prosecutors announced additional charges last week against Loughlin, Giannulli and 14 other wealthy parents. They face one count of conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud and honest-services mail and wire fraud, as well as one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering.
Loughlin is best known for playing the role of Aunt Becky on Full House . Giannulli's Mossimo brand was a core clothing label at Target until 2017 .
Law Lori Loughlin, 15 Others Indicted On New Charges In College Admissions Scandal Giannulli and Loughlin are accused of paying $500,000 in bribes arranged by college admissions consultant William ""Rick"" Singer to get their daughters admitted to the University of Southern California as recruits for the crew team, despite neither of them being a rower.
According to the Justice Department's superseding indictment , Giannulli and Loughlin made payments in 2016 and 2017 to former USC Associate Athletic Director Donna Heinel and to Key Worldwide Foundation, which was operated by Singer.
The indictment paints a picture of how the Justice Department built its case:
""On or about November 29, 2018, Singer called Loughlin from Boston, Massachusetts. During the call, Singer said, in sum and substance, that [Key Worldwide Foundation] was being audited by the IRS, which was asking about the two payments of $200,000 by the Giannullis. Singer added: 'So I just want to make sure that you know that, one, that you're probably going to get a call and that I have not told them anything about the girls going through the side door, through crew, ever though they didn't do crew to get into USC. So I—that is—all I told them was that you guys made a donation to our foundation to help underserved kids.' Loughlin replied, 'Um-hmm.' ""

Zelda Gardner/Getty Images Zelda Gardner/Getty Images Before the repeal, Arizona was one of at least seven states with curriculum laws around LGBTQ issues.
Zelda Gardner/Getty Images On Thursday, Arizona lawmakers repealed a law that restricted how public school teachers could talk about LGBTQ relationships in health classes.
The Arizona law regulated HIV/AIDS instruction in public schools. Since 1991, it has banned teachers in those courses from promoting ""a homosexual life-style,"" portraying ""homosexuality as a positive alternative life-style"" or suggesting there are safe ways to have homosexual sex.
At least six other states have curriculum laws around LGBTQ issues, according to the advocacy group GLSEN . Like many of the laws that exist in other states, Arizona's was created in the throes of the HIV/AIDS epidemic.
The repeal was the culmination of a lawsuit filed against Arizona education leaders in March , and years of advocacy from Democrats and LGBTQ advocacy groups.
Education Arizona Law Leaves Schools Struggling To Navigate LGBTQ Issues Education 5 Ways To Make Classrooms More Inclusive ""We're so excited and relieved and, I think, in a state of shock, to be honest,"" said Carol Brochin, a plaintiff in the lawsuit with her child, who lawsuit identifies as S.C.
""[S.C.] was so surprised and really taken aback and started crying, actually,"" Brochin said.
S.C., a Mexican-American seventh-grader, uses they/them pronouns and identifies as queer.
""They are the emotional center for their friends,"" Brochin said, adding that she thinks it's because of how much S.C. has been through.
The lawsuit described the bullying and offensive name-calling S.C. experienced in sixth grade while attending a Tucson Unified School District middle school. It said S.C. was ""repeatedly called a 'stupid gay kid' and 'faggot' by other students,"" and S.C. did not feel safe at school and ""frequently went to the school nurse's office because they were so upset from the harassment and bullying.""
The complaint argued that because S.C. would take courses that are subject to the curriculum law in high school, they ""will face further stigma and will be denied equal education opportunities because of the Law.""

It was unclear from the beginning who, if anyone, would defend the law. One of the lawsuit's listed defendants, Arizona Superintendent Kathy Hoffman, had already publicly supported the LGBTQ curriculum restrictions' repeal.
In a 24-hour period between Wednesday and Thursday, the Arizona House and Senate voted on a repeal, and Gov. Doug Ducey signed it into law.
The amendment was brought by Republican Rep. T.J. Shope.

We should probably go ahead and see if we can't get out of this,"" Shope said after the vote. He added that repealing the law would save taxpayer money that would have gone to defending it against the lawsuit.
Democratic Sen. Martín Quezada had tried to repeal the law every year since 2016, but Republican lawmakers blocked his bill from advancing.
""I want us to all be honest with ourselves today about this bill,"" Quezada said in explaining his vote for the repeal. ""We would not be here today if it was not a forced issue.""
Several LGBTQ lawmakers explained how powerful it was to vote yes on the repeal.

""It's puzzling why they would be attracted to a place like this,"" says Dresang.
""The problem with the militias is you don't know who they are and you don't know what they want,"" says Kasulaitis, a local historian whose roots in Arivaca go way back. She grew up on ranchland that has been in her family since 1879. ""I put 'No Trespassing' signs on my fence, not because of the border crossers, but because of the militia. They're a worry to me.""
Poker night
Tuesday night in Arivaca means it's poker night at Joe Farrington's double-wide. Some of the men gathered around the table have been playing poker together for nearly 40 years.

Dominic Valente for NPR Now, the militia groups' presence is putting that harmonious spirit to the test.
""It's made some of the locals more standoffish, a little more defensive,"" says Farrington. ""Everybody used to be pretty open out here, but now you gotta kinda wonder, if you meet a stranger, is he just a nice hunter? Or is he some crazed guy that thinks everybody that lives in town is a criminal?""
He's referring to what happened last year, when militia groups came and spread wild conspiracy theories that the townspeople were in cahoots with Mexican drug cartels and sex traffickers.

Many in town worry that Foley's presence in Arivaca will draw more militias to town.
They remember all too well the brutal crime that happened here 10 years ago, when members of a militia group shot and killed a local man, Raul Flores, and his 9-year-old daughter, Brisenia, in a home invasion. Arivacans' worst fear is that something like that could happen again.
Along the border, support for Trump and the wall
The drive from Arivaca to the Mexico border is a slow, bumpy ride through rugged grassland and up mountains dotted with mesquite trees and saguaro cactus.
Ranchers Jim and Sue Chilton raise cattle on this land , part of the Coronado National Forest, right up to the Mexico border.

The Chiltons say the Mexican cartels run drugs through this land constantly.
Standing by the wire fence, Jim Chilton says: ""I saw a group right over there, a year ago or more. Most of the people coming across our ranch drop their drugs, and they go back to Mexico for another return trip. They know the area. They know every trail.""

For several years now, she and others in Arivaca have been targeted by a local man who has harassed and threatened them with venomous letters, Facebook posts and emails. Mostly, he's incensed about immigration and what he calls ""liberal trash.""
It all started, Randall says, when the man submitted a letter for publication that violated the paper's rules of civility. She says his crusade of harassment began when she asked him to clean up the language.
Eventually, it got so bad that the targets of his abuse went to court and got restraining orders against him.

Opinion: Donald Trump 'Fell In Love' With Kim Jong Un,www.npr.org,,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2018/10/06/654857533/opinion-donald-trump-fell-in-love-with-kim-jong-un,"President Donald Trump walks with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore in June. Evan Vucci/AP hide caption toggle caption President Donald Trump walks with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore in June. Evan Vucci/AP
In the crush of urgent news, some astounding events can almost slip past.
At a rally in West Virginia last Saturday, President Trump told the crowd about feelings he has developed for Kim Jong Un. Remember when the president mocked North Korea's supreme leader as ""Little Rocket Man,"" and Kim ridiculed Trump as a ""mentally deranged U.S. dotard""?
Something else was going on.
Trump said , ""I was really being tough. And so was he. And we'd go back and forth. And then we fell in love. OK? No, really. He wrote me beautiful letters. And they're great letters. We fell in love. But you know what? Now, they'll say 'Donald Trump said they fell in love, how horrible. How horrible is that? So un-presidential.' ""
At least unprecedented.
Winston Churchill and Franklin D. Roosevelt were uncommonly close leaders during the darkest hours of the Second World War. FDR once cabled Churchill , ""It is fun to be in the same decade with you.""
But Kim Jong Un, the leader for whom Donald Trump has declared his devotion, presides over a cruel kingdom of repression , torture , starvation , assassinations , abduction , forced abortion , public executions and slave labor . It isn't fun to even be in the same hemisphere with Kim Jong Un.
It wouldn't be surprising for any president to toss an occasional bouquet toward Kim, if it encourages him to abandon nuclear weapons. When Hitler's Germany invaded the U.S.S.R. in 1941, Winston Churchill, who had long denounced Stalin, welcomed him into alliance, and explained, ""If Hitler invaded hell I would make at least a favorable reference to the devil in the House of Commons.""
But Senator Lindsey Graham, who has recently supported the administration, said this week , ""I'm telling President Trump: Enough with 'I love you.' ... There's nothing to love about Kim Jong Un.""
The letters between President Trump and Kim Jong Un haven't been made public. But don't you wonder what charm and blandishments have made President Trump so besotted with a man who had his own half-brother poisoned, and his uncle executed? Maybe there's just something about a despot in a high-buttoned pinstripe suit."

Noel King talks to Rabbi Jeffrey Myers, who was leading the Tree of Life Synagogue community in prayer when a gunman opened fire, killing 11 people. He says hate will not close his synagogue.
RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:
For the Tree of Life congregation in Pittsburgh, 2019 is going to be a year of rebuilding. In late October, members of that synagogue gathered for Shabbat service. Their prayers were interrupted by gunfire.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #1: Good morning. We're coming on the air right now with breaking news for those...
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)
MARTIN: Eleven Jewish worshippers have been killed at a synagogue in Pittsburgh. A man has been charged with hate crimes and could face the death penalty.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #2: The massacre at a synagogue in Pittsburgh has again revealed the ugly anti-Semitism that still exists in the United States.
MARTIN: In the aftermath, the synagogue's rabbi, Jeffrey Myers, vowed that hate would not close his building's doors. It's now been two months since that tragedy. In a conversation with our co-host Noel King, Rabbi Myers explained what has kept him hopeful.
JEFFREY MYERS: Such a outpouring of love and support from not just around the immediate community or even the United States, but from around the world. I'll give one example. There was a young boy who had his bar mitzvah also on October 27 in another synagogue. And upon his reflection of the horrific events of that day, he felt he needed to do something.
So he took some money that was gifted to him for his bar mitzvah and sent a donation to our synagogue as his way of connecting with us and sharing in his sorrow and at hoping for a brighter future. And I thought, wow. That just took my breath away. And to me, that's so uplifting.
NOEL KING, BYLINE: I wonder, though, over the past couple of months whether or not your perspective has changed at all on anti-Semitism in this country.
MYERS: I don't think my perspective has changed at all. Many felt that this sort of horrific massacre was inevitable at some point in the history of the Jewish community in the United States. It was going to happen. Many were surprised that it didn't happen, I guess, historically sooner than it did, but that it was going to happen at some point.
KING: You know, people will hear you say that there was a sense of inevitability, and they'll say, you know, no one should have to live like that. This is the United States of America. What do you say to people who don't understand what it's like to be in the United States and to know that anti-Semitism does exist?
MYERS: This one has probably the longest-running form of bigotry in existence in humanity because it's been around literally almost as long as the Jewish people have been around. I'd like to think in some, you know, rosy sort of view of the United States that our country was founded because people were escaping bigotry and prejudice in Europe and came to a new place to build a new life. And yet there's some disappointment there in that the hopes that people could escape those forms of bigotry didn't materialize. It still exists. Americans still preach words that wound and hurt fellow citizens.
KING: Rabbi, you've been advocating for political leaders and for people of all parties and all faiths to eliminate the word hate from their vocabulary. Why?
MYERS: When we use words of hate, to use that word only once, we're creating a more dangerous world because those words lead to actions such as the massacre that occurred in Tree of Life on October 27. So if one could just be careful and think about what they say and how they use their words, people may come to realize, wow, my words really have an impact. I can be really more careful about those choices.
KING: Having had time to reflect, I wonder do you have a message for the man who committed these murders?
MYERS: I think that's the first time I've been asked that question. To me, it's such an unconscionable act that it defies answers. I don't think that anything I could ask, I would find a suitable answer that would soothe my soul, ease my pain or burden. So I don't have anything that I would ask at this time. I don't know if I ever would.
KING: Rabbi Jeffrey Myers, thank you so much for being with us.

"Get Paid To Stay In Bed, For Space Science",www.npr.org,npr.org,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/14/713195716/get-paid-to-stay-in-bed-for-space-science?station=KXJZ_FM,"NPR's Sacha Pfeiffer speaks with Jennifer Ngo-Anh of the European Space Agency about their planned study during which subjects will stay in bed for two months.
SACHA PFEIFFER, HOST:
What if sleeping on the job wasn't a firing offense but was actually your job? NASA and the European Space Agency want to pay you almost $20,000 to do just that in Cologne, Germany. You'd be helping them study how the body adapts to weightlessness - catch is you have to stay in bed 24/7 for two months straight. That means no getting up for bathroom breaks, bathing or meals. If you're still interested, you may want to talk to Jennifer Ngo-Anh. She's team leader in human and robotic exploration at the European Space Agency. And she joins us on the line from near Amsterdam.
Jennifer, welcome to the program.
JENNIFER NGO-ANH: What a nice introduction (laughter).
PFEIFFER: (Laughter) So as I understand it, people would eat, they would drink, they would exercise, even use the bathroom lying in bed, much of that time with their head tilted down six degrees. Is that what this looks like for two months?
NGO-ANH: That is correct. When volunteers lie in bed with their heads tilted roughly six degrees below the horizontal, then a lot of the effects of - that spaceflight has on the human body can be simulated or being reproduced. It is not to annoy volunteers, but it is actually to test countermeasures.
PFEIFFER: So basically, lying in bed for a long time kind of mimics weightlessness?
NGO-ANH: Yes. It's a - it's an excellent model for us to study how the human body reacts to being exposed to weightlessness.
PFEIFFER: And what's the goal of the study? What do you hope to learn and then apply?
NGO-ANH: We're testing artificial gravity as a countermeasure. So volunteers will be exposed to artificial gravity a couple of minutes or half an hour in total per day. If this bedrest study shows that - or confirms this, then we may recommend artificial gravity as a potential countermeasure for future spaceflight missions. And they can then look into how to actually implement that onboard a space station be it via a short arm human centrifuge within the spacecraft or be it by designing a spacecraft that rotates.
PFEIFFER: You mentioned a centrifuge. I understand that part of this study involves the study subjects being spun around in a centrifuge. Why does that have to happen?
NGO-ANH: So when the volunteers are spun in the centrifuge, the fluids within the human body are propelled towards the head. And that counteracts some of the effects that we see when astronauts are in weightlessness.
PFEIFFER: So after being up in space for so long, the fluids get distributed incorrectly. Is that what happens?
NGO-ANH: Correct.
PFEIFFER: How do you get exercise while you're bed-bound? And is it even possible to get any cardio activity?
NGO-ANH: It is possible for volunteers to conduct exercise. We have tested everything from jumping in bed to cycling in bed. And that is through the use of - yeah - clever exercise devices that can be mounted onto the beds.
PFEIFFER: You know, the idea of getting paid to rest sounds great at first. But then as you start to learn the details and realize how confined you are, it starts to sound a lot less appealing. So who would want to do this?
NGO-ANH: A lot of people are intrigued about the idea of contributing to advance knowledge that helps us to really have humans live and work in space for extended periods of time.
PFEIFFER: Jennifer Ngo-Anh is with the European Space Agency.
Jennifer, thanks for talking with us.
NGO-ANH: Sure. You're very welcome.

SACHA PFEIFFER, HOST:
This week, Congress and the public await the expected release of the Mueller report - or at least what Attorney General William Barr is willing to let them see. What will it say? How much will it be redacted? What will the president tweet about it? Joining me now to discuss this and other political news of the day is national political correspondent Mara Liasson.
Good morning, Mara.
MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Good morning, Sacha.
PFEIFFER: Mara, when the Mueller report comes out, what are the key elements Congress will be looking for?
LIASSON: Well, Congress has asked for the report and all the underlying investigative materials. It's - I doubt they'll get everything that they want, so there's going to be a big fight about getting as much material as they're calling for. What we're watching for is what in the report explains why Bob Mueller decided not to make a conclusion about obstruction of justice. We'll be looking and Congress will be looking for what he says about Russian contacts with the Trump campaign. He didn't think any of them rose to the legal crime of conspiracy.
But, you know, Congress is very suspicious of Attorney General William Barr's redactions because last week he repeated the unfounded claim of the president that somehow the Justice Department had spied on Trump and his campaign. It was court-approved surveillance, surveillance approved by a judge. But suspicions are now running high. And the president has tweeted - why should the Democrats in Congress have a right to examine the report? - which is a very basic, simple question with a simple answer. Article 1 says that Congress is a separate and equal branch of government and they have a right to oversee the Justice Department.
So he has been now, again, calling the report treasonous and saying that it should not be released after previously he said he was fine with it coming out.
PFEIFFER: Right. And what do you make of that? So why the criticism of it while sort of simultaneously claiming that it largely clears him?
LIASSON: Well, I think originally, he really wanted to establish a narrative based on Barr's summary of the Mueller report - that it completely exonerated him. Then there were a whole bunch of reports that the summary did not accurately reflect what was in the report and the suggestion that there were a lot of negative things in that report about the president. So he went back to attacking the Mueller report - trying to undermine its credibility - so that when it does come out, he can dismiss it as a partisan witch hunt.
PFEIFFER: And is that undermining campaign viewed as working?
LIASSON: Actually not. And what's so interesting about public opinion since Barr's summary was released is that it hasn't really moved at all. Big chunks of the public still believe the president has not been exonerated despite the fact that he's been repeating that he's been totally and completely exonerated. And that's because so much of the American public is so locked in. Seventy percent of Americans are - either strongly disapprove of Donald Trump or strongly approve of him. It's about, you know, 40 who strongly disapprove, about 29 who strongly approve. It shows you that even though he can dominate the media narrative, he can't always win the argument.
PFEIFFER: Different issue, which is WikiLeaks, which was in the news this week - last week, Trump said, I know nothing about WikiLeaks. That's quite different from when he said, I love WikiLeaks, during the 2016 campaign.
LIASSON: He actually said that about 141 times, either on tape - on video - or in tweets. And what that shows you is that - how confident he is that he can sit in the Oval Office and say, I don't know anything about WikiLeaks, knowing that every TV station in the world is going to start playing all the tape of him saying how much he loved WikiLeaks during the campaign. It shows you how confident he is that the norms and rules about how presidents should be accurate and truthful do not apply to him.
PFEIFFER: And presumably, he'll think the same in terms of issues he's expected to run on, like immigration.
LIASSON: Well, immigration is the No. 1 issue the president ran on in 2016. He's going to run on it again in 2020. And of course, he's been very, very frustrated because more and more families are coming to the border to apply for asylum. And he has offered a bunch of different proposals - closing the border, shutting down the asylum system - and nothing seems to be working. The latest thing that he is proposing is to take these asylum-seekers and send them to sanctuary cities, cities that have decided to limit their cooperation with immigration authorities. Here's what he said.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And they want more people in their sanctuary cities. Well, we'll give them more people. We can give them a lot. We can give them an unlimited supply. And let's see if they're so happy.
LIASSON: Yeah. So you can see here, on the one hand, this is a bit of a self-own because immigrants would love to be sent to San Francisco and cities that are welcoming to them. The mayors of those cities have already said, fine, we'll take it. So in his effort to own the libs (ph), he has used policy and families as pawns to punish his political opponents. And that certainly breaks another norm.
PFEIFFER: That's NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson.
Thanks, Mara.
LIASSON: Thank you.

Sarah Walor/Courtesy of the artist In 1986, Bruce Hornsby became famous for his single ""The Way It Is."" But since then, he has embraced the constant evolution of his musical style throughout his career, experimenting with jazz, classical and even country. Never the same kind of musician, Hornsby has jammed on the accordion with the Grateful Dead and composed movie soundtracks for Spike Lee . His latest album, Absolute Zero , out now, is an embodiment of this constant motion, spiraling into whatever creative vision Hornsby has next.
First Listen 'Absolute Zero' Proves That Bruce Hornsby Is Still Up For Adventure Throughout his ambitious exploration of genre and sound, Hornsby says he always follows his own instinct. ""I'm just interested in my older age and trying to make a sound that I haven't quite heard before,"" Hornsby says. ""This record shows different ways that I'm trying to do that.""
The album features skitter-y piano, doleful strings, bubbling percussion, and inspiration drawn from other fields Hornsby admires like science and literature fiction. One track, ""White Noise"" is specifically based on his favorite work by David Foster Wallace , The Pale King . ""It's kind of a book about boredom. It's a book about IRS regional examination centers and the workers there,"" Hornsby explains. ""So this song is about tax return examiners and CPAs is as American heroes.""
Hornsby's latest exploration, Absolute Zero, is out now via Zappo Productions. Hornsby joined NPR's Sacha Pfeiffer to talk about searching for inspiration in unlikely places and how Absolute Zero came together. Hear their conversation in the audio link."
Trio Of Bald Eagles In Illinois Is Caring For Three Eaglets : NPR,www.npr.org,Francesca Paris,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/16/713767032/an-unusual-family-of-bald-eagles-adds-three-eaglets,"Enlarge this image Starr, a female bald eagle, looks over her eaglets in a nest along the Mississippi River in April.

She is raising the three eaglets along with her two male partners, Valor I and Valor II.
Stewards of Upper Mississippi River Refuge via AP You can tell Tolstoy that not every happy family is alike after all.
Along the Mississippi River in Illinois lives an unusual family of six bald eagles. Two males and one female are caring for three eaglets — with the world watching on a livestream .
The two males, Valor I and Valor II, and the female, Starr, have been together since 2017, in the backwaters of the Upper Mississippi River National Wildlife and Fish Refuge.
Earlier that year the males' first partner, Hope, disappeared after a violent attack by other eagles. But the males stayed together and courted Starr, which experts say is a remarkable twist to an already unusual situation — bald eagle trios have been documented before, but rarely, according to the Audubon Society .
The birds saw three eggs hatch this year at the end of March and the beginning of April.
Stewards of the Upper Mississippi River Refuge via YouTube The unnamed eaglets, once tiny bundles covered in soft, gray down with wobbly legs and partially closed eyes, are now getting old enough to hold their heads up for feeding. They are just weeks away from being able to walk and tear up their own food — and eventually fly on their own.
And their parents are always keeping the pantry full, according to the Stewards of the Upper Mississippi River Refuge . On the menu are fish, fowl and the occasional muskrat and turtle.
It's an all-hands-on-deck co-parenting situation, with all three taking a role in maintaining the nest, incubating the eggs and raising the young, according to the stewards.
As the Audubon Society writes, ""Refuge biologists don't know for sure whether Valor I and Valor II have both fathered eaglets in this case, but based on the mating they've observed, the odds are good.""
And the trio is expected to stay together, say the stewards, as eagles mate for life.
Meanwhile in southwest Florida, two longtime bald eagle residents have recovered from nest devastation to hatch two eaglets of their own.
The pine tree that housed "" Vic and Nic "" toppled during Hurricane Irma in 2017, according to Eagle Country , which operates the livestream of their nest. The couple rebuilt in an adjacent tree, but their nest was blown out of the tree late last year. They hustled to rebuild and laid their first eggs just over a month later.
A few months out, eaglets Dandy and Spur appear to be healthy, with voracious appetites and their long, black juvenile feathers growing in.
There's been no such luck for the star eagles of Washington, D.C.
The National Arboretum's popular couple , Mr. President and the First Lady, haven't laid any eggs. Neither have Liberty and Justice , a pair living on the grounds of the D.C. Police Academy. Experts predict no eaglets for the two couples this year, as the brief window for breeding comes to a close, The Washington Post reports .
Mr. President and the First Lady's Twitter page acknowledged the empty nest. ""Who was the wise guy who said 'If you build it, they will come?' "" the account tweeted .
Okay Honey, now I’m starting to get impatient! #americaneaglefoundation #naeaglecam #mrpresident #firstlady #fona #usna #baldeagles #DC pic.twitter.com/lq07KNEiff
— Mr. P & First Lady (@naeaglecam) April 13, 2019 The couple lost one of their eaglets last year. The eaglet, Valor, was born in the spring and grew into a sleek, young bird, under the watchful eye of his parents and the many eyes of online eagle-watchers. But in midsummer he fell from the nesting tree. When he was taken to a bird rescue and research facility, he was found to be severely underweight and tested positive for West Nile Virus. Researchers said it was ""extremely unlikely"" that he would recover, and they euthanized him in August.
Valor I, Valor II and Starr have also known their share of loss. When the trio of bald eagles hatched their first eaglets together last year, one died of unknown causes before it could take its first flight.
While eaglet deaths are a blow to observers, they're a relatively common phenomenon. According to the stewards , as many as 70 to 80 percent of bald eagles in the wild die before they reach adulthood at five years of age.
But fans are undeterred by that fragility. Just like the beloved eagles of Washington, D.C., the Illinois trio has drawn a group of dedicated fans.
""Beautiful family,"" one woman wrote on Facebook . ""I watch every day.""
On another night, when storms blew through northern Illinois, another commenter wrote in with relief that the family had emerged unscathed.
""I was sending out prayers for them last night, when these storms were going through,"" she wrote. ""How scary for them! God Bless them."""

Hulton Archive/Getty Images Monday's fire that ravaged Paris' Notre Dame Cathedral, bringing down its spire and roof, struck during Holy Week. But even outside this key period in the Roman Catholic calendar, the cathedral draws visitors all year, some 12 million of them.
It is the most famous of the French Gothic cathedrals of the Middle Ages and is distinguished by its size, antiquity and architectural interest.

Nearly 100 years later, in 1431, Henry VI of England was crowned as the King of France there.
By the 17th century, the cathedral was in disrepair. But Napoleon saved it from demolition and had himself crowned Emperor there in 1804.
The cathedral is celebrated in Victor Hugo's novel The Hunchback of Notre-Dame published in 1831.

College Students In LA And Boston React With Frustration And Cynicism To Scandal - NPR,www.npr.org,,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/03/13/703162319/college-students-say-theyre-not-surprised-by-admissions-scandal,"Students at UCLA and elsewhere are not surprised at the admissions cheating scandal rocking the higher education world.

Actress Lori Loughlin, from the TV show Full House , turned herself in to the FBI Wednesday, a day after being charged by prosecutors in a massive college admissions cheating and bribery scandal.
Loughlin along with her husband, designer Mossimo Giannulli, were among 33 parents who allegedly paid enormous sums of money to get their kids into the nation's top universities.
Meantime, Loughlin's daughter, a known social media influencer, is one of many students across the country now having their legitimacy as a student questioned. News of the scam is reinforcing many students' worst fears that the college admissions system is rigged in favor of those with money and privilege.
The details are jaw-dropping: the $6,000,000 bribe. The beloved coaches on the take. The parents hoping to impress schools, by having their kids' faces photo-shopped onto the bodies of real athletes.
What you're born into is a lot of what you get in life, as this shows. Rugile Pekinas, UCLA junior
But to many students, the underlying reality that some rich kids are buying their way into school comes as no shock.
""My initial reaction was disgust,"" says UCLA junior Rugile Pekinas. ""[I was] not surprised at all, really.""
Pekinas is one of many who see it as just part of the game. ""What you're born into is a lot of what you get in life, as this shows,"" she sighs.
The bigger surprise, to students like Jacqueline Valadez, is that people are now actually getting busted for doing it.

""We've always known that people with more power and influence are able to get away with things that they shouldn't be able to,"" says Valadez. ""But my first reaction was 'why all of the sudden are they facing repercussions for it?' That's the part that was surprising to me."" Does It Matter Where You Go To College? Some Context For The Admissions Scandal
So far, the students themselves are not among those charged in the scheme, nor, have they been disciplined by schools — at least as far as we know. Olivia Jade Giannulli, the daughter of Loughlin and Giannulli, is among the most high profile students now under a cloud of suspicion. Her parents allegedly paid a half million dollars in bribes to get their two daughters into the University of Southern California. Olivia Jade posted a video last August, just before she started at USC, that makes it clear she was not going to college for the academics:
""I do want the experience of game days and partying,"" she says in the video. ""I don't really care about school ... as you guys all know.""
Giannulli quickly backtracked on her post, calling it ""super ignorant and stupid,"" and insisting that ""education is important.""
Cheating scandal raises questions
The scandal has left many students — especially those who got into school the hard way — wondering who else didn't.
""In general you can tell like when someone bought their way in,"" says UCLA junior Mario Anderson. ""They just have that je ne sais quoi [about] money."" Anderson says he's been rethinking why he got rejected from Columbia. ""If it weren't for the 'moneyed' [students] getting in, I would have had a better chance,"" he says.

Waruguru Ndirangu is a senior at UCLA and says she's heard the same qualms from a friend who was rejected from Stanford.
""At the time she just felt like, OK there's probably better people, more competitive people,"" Ndirangu says. ""But now, knowing that like people could just pay their way in and take her spot, it's really disheartening.""
Ndirangu says it's especially infuriating to her, as a student of color.
""People say that we only get in because of affirmative action, or that we don't deserve to be here,"" she says. ""So it's ironic that the people telling us this actually paid their way into here.""
People say that we only get in because of affirmative action, or that we don't deserve to be here. So it's ironic that the people telling us this actually paid their way into here. Waruguru Ndirangu, UCLA senior
Getting it all on the table now, Ndirangu says, may be something of a silver lining to the scandal. ""Now they can't tell us s*** about how we got in here,"" she says. ""I feel like for us, it kind of takes that chip off of our shoulder from these accusations. To see the script flip like that, it kind of feels good to be honest.""
Students of wealth will always have a better shot
On the other side of the country, on the campus of Boston College, students express similar frustration and cynicism.
Selena Bemak is applying to grad school at Boston College. As she sees it, the news that a few dozen bad apples were busted yesterday is less of a comfort than a reminder of how much she and other less privileged students are up against.
""I will always worry in back of mind,"" Bemak says, that students of greater wealth and privilege will have a better shot than she does. Yesterday's arrests, ""could not have cleaned up [the corruption] entirely. There's no way they could have.""
Bemak is among the many who also worry about the cheating and fraud that happens on a smaller scale every day, by people embellishing their applications, for example, or overstating how many hours they volunteer, or the awards they got.
Hard as it is to verify every detail of every application, senior Caitlin Connor says it's up to schools to do a better job of policing and deterring that. Then, she says, ""students would be more hesitant to lie on their application, when they know that certain schools are doing something like spot checks and things like that.""
I mean the world's not fair. A lot of people are going to be doing crooked things to get into college. That's just how the world works. All you can do is do your best, and hope for the best. David McKenzie, Boston College junior
But ultimately, she says, it will be hard to level the playing field when the reality is that that wealthy and influential parents can also pay to play — without breaking any laws.
""People are still going to say 'I'm going to donate a million dollars for this building and then you can let my son into school',"" she says. ""And obviously its unjust, but of course it will keep happening.""
Junior David McKenzie, who was recruited — legitimately — by the Boston College track team, takes a similarly pessimistic view of it all. ""I mean the world's not fair,"" he says. ""A lot of people are going to be doing crooked things to get into college. That's just how the world works. All you can do is do your best, and hope for the best.""

Julian Assange Is Under Arrest. Will WikiLeaks Continue To Be Relevant? : NPR,www.npr.org,Miles Parks,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/16/712666465/what-does-julian-assanges-arrest-mean-for-wikileaks-and-u-s-elections,"Enlarge this image WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange makes his way into the Westminster Magistrates' Court after being arrested April 11 in London.

toggle caption Alberto Pezzali/NurPhoto/Getty Images WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange makes his way into the Westminster Magistrates' Court after being arrested April 11 in London.
Alberto Pezzali/NurPhoto/Getty Images What does the arrest of Julian Assange mean for the role that WikiLeaks might play in future election interference targeting the United States?
National security officials say they're confident that foreign activity will continue through 2020, but no one knows how familiar it may look, how much it may evolve — or whether a WikiLeaks without Assange could play a similar role.
The answer, cyber-observers say, is probably yes ... but.
""WikiLeaks does have a reputation for credibility,"" said Jake Williams, founder of the cybersecurity firm Rendition Infosec. ""They also have a reputation for being a mouthpiece of the Russian government.""
Politics What Will Mueller's Russia Report Mean For Election Security In 2020? WikiLeaks, by its account, is bigger than Assange, claiming more than 100 staffers around the world. But he is its best-known staffer and public face, and he has been taken out of the loop for now.
Assange has been charged with helping a then-U.S. Army intelligence soldier, Chelsea Manning, access U.S. government systems to download secret material. WikiLeaks then published huge numbers of those documents.
Assange would need to be extradited from the United Kingdom to the U.S. to face the charges. That process, and then his eventual trial, could mean months or years during which he would be absent from the workings of the site he launched.
The Streisand effect
Even so, the degree to which the arrest of Assange renews attention on the legacy organization, rather than on just him, may increase its profile, Williams said. He likened it to the way Barbra Streisand wound up drawing more attention to her beachfront mansion by trying to suppress photos of it.
National Security Julian Assange Arrested, Faces U.S. Charges Related To 2010 WikiLeaks Releases ""Taking him out of play may actually have the Streisand effect , where more people are now aware of [WikiLeaks] than would have been before,"" said Williams.
Even so, more people than ever also may become aware that WikiLeaks served in 2016 as a fence for the Russian military intelligence agency GRU. The agency used cyberattacks to steal data from Americans , which it then gave to WikiLeaks to release based on its reputation as an independent arbiter of secrets.
Politics Abolishing The Electoral College Would Be More Complicated Than It May Seem The operatives used WikiLeaks to release troves of embarrassing emails: a data dump that led to the resignation of Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz and a dramatic shift of media focus for much of the 2016 presidential race.
American intelligence officials have been clear that efforts to affect elections in the U.S. have not stopped.
""We assess that foreign actors will view the 2020 U.S. elections as an opportunity to advance their interests,"" Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats told a Senate committee this year. ""We expect them to refine their capabilities and add new tactics as they learn from each other's experiences and efforts.""
The kind of phishing attacks that led to those data breaches remain among the most popular forms of cybertactics, and there were attempts to use them in 2018 too.
Then-Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., said Russia sent her staff fake emails last summer in an effort to gain access to passwords.
Politics Russian Hackers Targeted The Most Vulnerable Part Of U.S. Elections. Again WikiLeaks has long been seen as the gold standard for releasing secret information. The site has built a broad reach, worked with many legacy media organizations and generally made a strong effort to protect sources, Williams said.
The organization may even use Assange's arrest as a way to raise money, said David Fidler, a cybersecurity expert at the Council on Foreign Relations.
""Those who support what WikiLeaks has done in the past will take [this] as a call to arms, as a rallying cry, that it ought to double down on the mission that Assange and the other founders of WikiLeaks originally created,"" Fidler said. ""I could see them using Assange as a sort of whistleblower or martyr figure to increase the scale of what they're trying to do.""
Parallels Meet The Activist Who Uncovered The Russian Troll Factory Named In The Mueller Probe WikiLeaks still retains a lot of goodwill around the world, based on the revelations that came from those documents, which may motivate fellow travelers into those same kinds of disclosures in the future.
But because of WikiLeaks' real or perceived ties to the Russia government, both Fidler and Williams said that if an adversary wanted to push information into American discourse — and have it taken seriously leading up to the next election — it might use a different route from WikiLeaks.
That could mean creating a new avenue, like Russian operatives tried to do with the website DCLeaks, or using established social media or other websites.
""I probably would avoid WikiLeaks and likely use another distribution method,"" Williams said. ""What that is, is still yet to be determined.""

toggle caption Anna Moneymaker/Bloomberg via Getty Images Analysts say Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg and the company were slow to take responsibility in the crashes of two 737 Max planes within months of each other.
Anna Moneymaker/Bloomberg via Getty Images After a second 737 Max jet crashed in less than five months, it took Boeing weeks to speak openly about the role its flight control software may have played. Then on April 4, CEO Dennis Muilenburg said: ""It's our responsibility to eliminate this risk. We own it.""
Critics say Muilenburg and Boeing waited too long to say it.
Questions about the safety of the 737 Max trace back to Oct. 29, when an Indonesian Lion Air flight plunged into the Java Sea. At the time, Boeing issued a terse statement extending ""our heartfelt sympathies to the families"" of the 189 victims. It said initial investigations showed the downed 737 Max had faulty data from a sensor.
Business Pilots Split Over FAA Chief's Claims On Boeing 737 Max Training But Boeing also said the same plane flew with the same faulty sensor a day before — and a different crew managed to keep control.
Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a professor at the Yale School of Management, says Boeing's response bordered on pointing a finger at pilots overseas. ""There was a question as to whether or not the pilots followed the right routines initially and if they were properly trained,"" he says.
In the wake of the crash, Boeing put out a bulletin to emphasize what pilots should do in case of a faulty sensor. It did not mention that the sensor feeds an automated flight control software feature called MCAS that was suspected of forcing the Lion Air plane into a nosedive. The FAA certified the 737 Max to fly without requiring pilots to train on or even know about MCAS.
Business Boeing Brings 100 Years Of History To Its Fight To Restore Its Reputation After that business as usual resumed, and orders kept pouring in for the 737 Max, the fastest-selling jet in the company's history.
Then on March 10, a 737 Max flown by Ethiopian Airlines crashed, with 157 casualties.
Over the next two days, countries from China to Europe grounded the planes.
But in the U.S., Boeing's CEO announced that the company was developing an update to its MCAS software, and that the FAA did not require any further action. And Muilenburg even called the White House to say there was no data to support grounding the planes.
Africa Preliminary Crash Report Says Ethiopian Airlines Crew Complied With Procedures Erik Bernstein, vice president of Bernstein Crisis Management in Monrovia, Calif., says this reaction may have aimed to protect Boeing legally.

When the vaunted Democratic blue wall stretching across the Upper Midwest crumbled in Republican Donald Trump's 2016 presidential victory, Minnesota stood out on the map as a holdout.
Now President Trump sees the state as a personal challenge heading into the 2020 election, and his campaign is making it an early target.
No Republican presidential candidate has claimed the state's 10 Electoral College votes since Richard Nixon in 1972 — the longest blue streak of a state in the United States (the District of Columbia has voted for the Democratic presidential nominee since it gained three electoral votes in 1964).
Trump acknowledged the Democratic hold on Minnesota during a quick stop there Monday to tout his signature tax law .
""This has been a very special state. It has been a rare victory for Republicans. And we almost won it,"" Trump said during a visit to a trucking company in Burnsville, a suburb of Minneapolis. He said the result would have been different if he had come more often: ""One more speech.""
Trump used the official White House event, which lasted just over an hour, to speak to local concerns. He addressed proposed mining and pipeline projects in the north, farmers' anxieties in the vast agricultural parts of Minnesota and simmering tensions across the state over immigration. He told the friendly audience he would pursue a health care overhaul ""after the election, assuming you elect Republicans.""
If the 2016 race is a baseline, Trump starts his effort to flip Minnesota in better shape than any Republican in memory. Sanders' Presidential Campaign To Visit States That Helped Trump In 2016
Trump won 78 of the state's 87 counties . But he still lost to Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton by just 1.5 percentage points. That's in a state where considerably more third-party votes went to right-of-center alternatives — about 6 percent of the presidential votes cast — than those on the left.
Trump's losing margin was closer than any presidential race in the state since 1984, when home-state Democratic nominee Walter Mondale edged Republican President Ronald Reagan by a few thousand votes. Minnesota and Washington, D.C., were the only places that kept Reagan from a clean sweep.
Minnesota Republican Party Chair Jennifer Carnahan said it all adds up to opportunity for Trump.
""We know that the president has strong support from across Minnesota. I think his support is even stronger today than when he ran in 2016,"" she said. ""The more times we can get him back here, the better.""
As the 2020 race ramps up, Minnesota is getting ready for its turn as a presidential battleground and all the candidate visits, ads and persuasion efforts that come with it.

France's President Vows To Rebuild Notre Dame Cathedral,www.npr.org,,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/16/713809147/frances-president-vows-to-rebuild-notre-dame-cathedral,"France's President Vows To Rebuild Notre Dame Cathedral France's President Vows To Rebuild Notre Dame Cathedral Embed Embed
Notre Dame caught fire Monday and was badly damaged. Officials are expressing hope that they can save a cathedral that's stood at the heart of France's capital for eight centuries.
STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:
One striking thing about the fire at the Cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris is the pictures on social media - not just the pictures of the cathedral in flames, though it was hard to look away. It was people posting their own old images of the cathedral. Maybe they lived in Paris once. Maybe they made the one visit of their lifetimes to France and stood for the camera in front of the stone facade.
Many tourists came from nations, including the United States, that did not even exist when stonemasons began working on that cathedral more than 800 years ago. Nobody was killed in yesterday's fire. But French President Emmanuel Macron spoke of the building as more than wood and stone.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: (Speaking French).
INSKEEP: The president said the cathedral is part of France's history, its literature and its psyche. NPR Paris correspondent Eleanor Beardsley witnessed the fire unfolding yesterday and has lived in Paris for years. Eleanor, hi.
ELEANOR BEARDSLEY, BYLINE: Hi, Steve.
INSKEEP: What has it been like over the years to share this - to be in this city with this cathedral?
BEARDSLEY: This cathedral is really an intimate part of everyone's life, really. You know, it's like your Notre Dame. Everyone has a piece of it, like you were saying. And, you know, every time there's a celebration or something big in Paris - I don't know - Olympic win or games, they ring the bells. And then, you know, the church celebrated its 850th birthday a couple years ago, and everyone came out. And it got new bells, and they all had names. And we knew all the names and the history.
And, you know, the zero point of all French roads - you know, if you're on the road, it says, you know, 800 kilometers to Paris - that's all from one little point in front of Notre Dame, so all roads in France lead to Notre Dame. It's our friend. And I woke up this morning with this feeling like, oh, God, our friend is damaged. It's hurting. And it was a different day today because of that.
INSKEEP: What was it like, then, having that connection, to be standing in the crowds outside of the cathedral as it burned?
BEARDSLEY: It was surreal. I mean, there was just, you know, thousands of people lined up. It was so quiet. I mean, you had to be very quiet. And people were singing hymns. People were saying prayers. Some people were kneeling. And everyone was so deeply sad. No one wanted to talk. I mean, no one wanted - people were crying. And there was also this panic because the flames did not subside. They even seemed to get bigger at one point, and it seemed everyone was just - could barely breathe. They could barely stand the tension. And it was just tragic. It was dramatique, dramatic, as the French would say.
INSKEEP: Well, from outside - let's talk about this - from outside, it looked like everything might be lost but the stone walls. But then images began emerging from the inside, where it seems that some large amount of this giant building has survived.
BEARDSLEY: Yes. I mean, I'm sitting here right now looking at it. And the spire is gone. It collapsed. It weighed 250 tons, and they said that it pierced the nave and went through. But the bell towers are still there. Those iconic, square, you know, Quasimodo, ""The Hunchback Of Notre-Dame"" bell towers are there. And, you know, the stained glass windows are gone, and there's some charred stones, but the structure is there.
And as President Macron said, the structure is here. It's still with us, and we have hope now. The inside has been damaged. I saw footage on TV of smoldering, you know, piles of rubbish, and it's open partly to the sky. So there's been a lot of damage, but Notre Dame is still here.
INSKEEP: You know, it's amazing to think about the fact that you're in that ancient city, Eleanor. And as with many ancient cities, there are landmarks that survive for centuries and centuries. And this is a moment, I suppose, to think about how almost random it is what comes down through the generations to us and what lasts for us to see from some other generation.
BEARDSLEY: It is. And people have told me, you know, I walk by Notre Dame every day, and I just barely notice her, they say. And she's beautiful, and what a precious thing we've lost now. And another person said, I was going to - I haven't been in 15 years. You know, I'm not a practicing Catholic. But I was going to go the other day, and I regret so that I didn't because now I don't know when I'll be able to go back in and see it. So yes, people realize the importance. This is the history of France, the history of Europe, the history of humanity, really.
INSKEEP: Do people give the cathedral a gender when they talk about it?
BEARDSLEY: Yes. They're saying her. Notre Dame de Paris, la dame - the great Notre Dame. Yes, it's a woman.
INSKEEP: Eleanor, thanks so much.
BEARDSLEY: Female. Thank you, Steve.

Health Officials Warn The Measles Outbreak Is Accelerating,www.npr.org,,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/16/713799015/health-officials-warn-the-measles-outbreak-is-accelerating,"Health Officials Warn The Measles Outbreak Is Accelerating Health Officials Warn The Measles Outbreak Is Accelerating Embed Embed
The U.S. has confirmed more than 500 measles cases so far this year. That's 50 percent higher than the total number recorded last year, even though we're only about a quarter of the way through 2019.
DAVID GREENE, HOST:
So back in the year 2000, measles was declared officially eliminated from the United States after a full year of no transmissions. But now the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is seeing a resurgence in the virus. New numbers were released yesterday, and so far 555 cases have been reported this year alone. So what should we understand about this spike? Let's turn to NPR global health correspondent Michaeleen Doucleff, who's been tracking this. Hi, Michaeleen.
MICHAELEEN DOUCLEFF, BYLINE: Good morning, David.
GREENE: So how bad is this outbreak?
DOUCLEFF: Yeah. So 555 cases is actually 50 percent more cases than we saw for the entire year last year. And we're only in April, so it's pretty significant. Another way to look at that is this is the largest - the second-largest outbreak we've seen in more than 20 years. And the CDC says that the numbers are only going to get worse, that it's accelerating.
GREENE: So far, I know we've been reporting that this is largely in New York. But is it popping up elsewhere?
DOUCLEFF: Yeah. So the vast majority of cases are linked to two in New York, one in Brooklyn and - one outbreak in Brooklyn and one in Rockland County, just north of the city. But the CDC also pointed to four other ongoing outbreaks in Washington state, Michigan, New Jersey and a few counties in California.
GREENE: So what happened? I mean, in 2000, it looked like there was no more measles. This was something - like, a virus that we weren't going to have to worry about anymore. What's going on?
DOUCLEFF: Yeah, so two things. Health officials say that two things are kind of coming together to really exacerbate the problem. First of all, measles is actually surging around the world right now. The World Health Organization just said that there have been four times as many cases worldwide this year than there were at this time last year. And several countries have massive outbreaks with tens of thousands of cases. That's like the Ukraine, Madagascar and the Philippines. But there's also significant outbreaks in several countries in the EU, Israel and a lot of parts of Southeast Asia. The CDC thinks that more families are traveling to these countries and bringing the virus back home.
And then, here at home, we have another problem. And that's vaccination rates. In several pockets around the country, communities' vaccination rates have dropped dramatically in the last few years below the level that's required to really protect the whole community. So once the virus comes to the U.S. from another country, it has a better chance of getting a foothold and triggering an outbreak.
GREENE: And this is a very contagious virus we should say - right? - compared to others?
DOUCLEFF: Oh, super, super contagious. So, like, it travels through the air. And if somebody coughs and sneezes on you, and you aren't protected with the vaccine, there's a 90 percent chance you're going to get infected.
GREENE: Which explains why we can see these numbers spike. You have a few people, parents who decide not to vaccinate, then, all of a sudden, I mean, it starts getting passed on in a significant way.
DOUCLEFF: Yeah, that's exactly right. And actually, communities need about 93, 95 percent of everyone vaccinated in order to really stop these outbreaks. And doctors say it's really important to make sure you have two doses of the vaccine, not just one. So parents should check to make sure everyone has two doses, including adults, in order to get full protection.
GREENE: Oh, that sounds like an important clarification. I mean, some people might think they've had a dose. They're vaccinated. But that doesn't do the job.
DOUCLEFF: Yeah. And it's important for adults to be vaccinated too. I know that I needed a booster, like when I was pregnant. So just make sure you check with your doctor that every kid and family member is vaccinated and especially with babies. Some doctors are recommending that if you're in an outbreak that babies get vaccinated early.
GREENE: NPR's global health correspondent Michaeleen Doucleff talking to us about this outbreak of the measles. Michaeleen, thank you.
DOUCLEFF: Thank you, David.

Trump Supports Sending Migrants To Sanctuary Cities,www.npr.org,,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/16/713798998/trump-supports-sending-migrants-to-sanctuary-cities,"Trump Supports Sending Migrants To Sanctuary Cities Trump Supports Sending Migrants To Sanctuary Cities Embed Embed Heard on Morning Edition
Steve Inskeep talks to White House spokesman Adam Kennedy about how the White House is embracing the idea of sending migrants to sanctuary cities. NPR's Domenico Montanaro weighs in.
STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:
What does President Trump intend to do about what he has described as a crisis on the border? Over the weekend, the president promoted an idea that his administration had previously rejected. Days of news coverage have played up the idea that the president would order migrants who were detained at the border to be bused to so-called sanctuary cities across the country. In Minnesota yesterday, the president expressed doubts that asylum-seekers are really asylum-seekers.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And they're saying, we need protection from our country. In the meantime, they're carrying their country's flag thousands, 2,000 miles walking up the journey. It's a big con job. That's what it is.
INSKEEP: Adam Kennedy is the White House deputy director of communications. And he's on the line once again. Welcome back to the program.
ADAM KENNEDY: Thanks for having me on, Steve.
INSKEEP: I want to understand this idea of busing people to sanctuary cities. This is an idea - according to the reporting, which I think the White House has acknowledged - that was knocked down by staff, knocked down by Homeland Security lawyers as possibly illegal. Why did they find it to be possibly illegal?
KENNEDY: Well, first of all, I think there was a very narrow option being looked at originally. When the president heard about this idea, he was very interested. And now there is more expansive options being looked at. And I think the real question is, why should the same four cities along the border face the brunt of illegal immigration day in and day out when we have numerous cities across this country that, through their rhetoric and policies, say they want more illegal immigration?
INSKEEP: Well, let's talk about that. You know that once people are bused at government expense to San Francisco or Chicago or New Orleans or Columbus, Ohio, they can go elsewhere, right?
KENNEDY: Oh, of course. Nobody's going to stop them from going elsewhere. So the question is, why is...
INSKEEP: So what's the point of spending - what's the point of spending money to take them somewhere when they're just going to go somewhere else?
KENNEDY: Because it's a huge burden for charity organizations, government NGOs in the four main cities along the border that receive the brunt of this to be the intake for all of it. Why can't cities throughout this country who have stated through policy and rhetoric that they want illegal immigrants in their towns to accept them into their communities? And if they - if the immigrants choose to move, that's - well, they can move.
INSKEEP: It is true - it is...
KENNEDY: But the cities shouldn't be the ones to say no. They should be accepting this. They should be welcoming this.
INSKEEP: Well, let's talk about that. It is true that a lot of people, lot of leaders in - lot of jurisdictions have said, people who are here illegally are actually part of the community, that they work jobs, that they contribute. That is absolutely true. But I do want to note, also, where these cities are - I mean, when you think about San Francisco - Nancy Pelosi's city, for example. But when I look at this map that we were referring to yesterday from the Center for Immigration Studies, which is a conservative think tank, there are sanctuary jurisdictions all across the country, including swing states that President Trump must win in 2020, like Ohio. Franklin County, Ohio, where Columbus is, is described as a sanctuary jurisdiction. Are you willing to say for sure right now the president wants to send asylum-seekers to Ohio?
KENNEDY: I think the president is looking at all options for how to relieve the pressure on the four primary border cities. But...
INSKEEP: Including asylum-seekers to swing states?
KENNEDY: I think your point is actually very good because I think there's been a lot of false claims that the president is trying to pick and choose political opponents to punish. This isn't about punishing anyone. This is the fact that we're seeing a crisis where four cities face thousands of people a day coming to their communities. They're overwhelmed. And you have other cities that aren't facing this crisis, yet at the same time, say they want more illegal immigrants.
INSKEEP: Wouldn't you actually - but if...
KENNEDY: So there shouldn't be any problem in correcting that disparity.
INSKEEP: But if that is the problem, wouldn't you actually address that problem by sending more federal resources to the border to deal with people, to process their claims, to adjudicate their claims, rather than what the president is now playing up - the idea of using federal resources, taking people away from the border to bus and transport them somewhere else in the country, even though they're just going to leave that place?
KENNEDY: Well, actually, the president's been advocating for more resources on the border for over two years. So absolutely, the president wants more resources on the border.
INSKEEP: But now he's advocating to take them away for this transportation project.
KENNEDY: There's plenty of ways to transport people. We're looking at all the ways. It may not require moving personnel. But the fact is that in terms of wanting more resources at the border, that's what President Trump has been advocating for since before he got into office. It's the Democrats who, time and time again, have stopped him and said, no more resources at the border, who have curtailed DHS requests for what they want. DHS right now is having to do emergency deployments of personnel on the border with the support of President Trump.
INSKEEP: You know, I don't want to get into all the details of legislative arguments. I'm sure there are instances in which Democrats have resisted more resources at the border. There's an abolish ICE movement and so forth. But there are also Democrats in Congress who have voted to double the size of the Border Patrol as part of broader immigration reform. They're - they seem to be having trouble getting cooperation from Republicans - don't they? - in broader immigration reform...
KENNEDY: No, no.
INSKEEP: ...To do some of the things the president says he wants.
KENNEDY: They should be convincing Nancy Pelosi and the leadership of the Democratic Party that we need more resources on the border, including a barrier, including more judges, including more detention beds and more personnel.
INSKEEP: And different and better visa rules? I mean, why wouldn't the president be putting his effort into actually changing some of the laws that he complains about?
KENNEDY: Steve, the president's been advocating this for two years. He's advocating for closing different loopholes that force catch and release to be the policy of this country, which he doesn't like, which he opposes; for changing credible fear standards so that we're not, over and over again, seeing 90 percent of the people rejected by asylum courts. The president's been advocating for changes to stop this catch-and-release policy, really, since the beginning. So the two things you've said - more resources and changes to our laws - are exactly what the president wants.
INSKEEP: Adam Kennedy, thanks for your time. Really appreciate it.
KENNEDY: Thank you for having me.
INSKEEP: He is the White House deputy director of communications. And NPR lead political editor Domenico Montanaro has been listening along with us. Domenico, good morning.
DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Hey there, Steve. Good morning.
INSKEEP: What do you hear there?
MONTANARO: Well, you know, there was an old sports broadcaster named Warner Wolf who used to say, let's go to the videotape. And maybe now we should say, let's go to the tweets (laughter) because when it comes to President Trump, he said on Friday - due to the fact that Democrats are unwilling to change our very dangerous immigration laws, we are indeed, as reported, giving strong considerations to placing illegal immigrants in sanctuary cities. The radical left, he said, always seems happy to have open borders, so this should make them very happy.
That sure sounds a whole lot like political retribution and not a good faith effort to try to get something done on this issue. As you noted, there have been - there were 68 senators who voted for comprehensive immigration reform. And a lot of these measures that we're talking about - in particular, cities trying to take a more active role - is something that you probably would find willing partners for, if this was something that was a real good faith negotiation that was going on behind the scenes. But before this was reported, you didn't hear about any effort from the White House to talk to Democratic leaders to try to get something like this done.
INSKEEP: And I guess we should note the president uses his bully pulpit to talk about immigration a lot, but they're not necessarily detailed policy proposals. They're attention-grabbing things like this proposal about sanctuary cities.
MONTANARO: And there's no comprehensive immigration reform effort underway, either being pushed by the White House or Republicans in Congress.
INSKEEP: Domenico, thanks so much. Really appreciate it.
MONTANARO: You're welcome.
INSKEEP: That's NPR's lead political editor, Domenico Montanaro.

Don't worry! Everything's going to be alright. But if you need more reassurance than that, look no further than ""Set of Stairs,"" from the Amsterdam-based band Pip Blom. It's a burst of frenetic joy to lift you up whenever life deals you a bad hand. Its singular message: You got this!
That's just one of the songs we're featuring on this week's show. We've also got wild and wonderful new music from former Tiny Desk contest winners Tank and the Bangas, gorgeous harmonies and an uplifting message of unity from Jesca Hoop with Lucius, and the singer known as Sevdaliza has a dark and mysterious reflection on love gone bad.
All that plus singer-songwriter Chris Staples announces his new album Holy Moly and shares a tale of young love called ""Everybody Said;"" and singer, multi-instrumentalist and poet Vera Sola pairs with Kenneth Pattengale of The Milk Carton Kids on ""Loving, Loving (Acoustic Reprise)."" Artists And Songs Featured On This Episode Tank And The Bangas Song: Nice Things
It's been two years since Tank and the Bangas won our hearts and our Tiny Desk Contest. Now they're weeks away from their brilliant, major-label debut Green Balloon . This song, ""Nice Things,"" is a window into their poetic, witty, insightful, jazz-infused R&B/hip-hop potpourri. The video version here is a live performance of a song that they newly recorded for Green Balloon which is out May 3 on Verve Forecast. YouTube Jesca Hoop Song: Shoulder Charge
Singer Jesca Hoop first heard the term ""shoulder charge"" in Elbow's song ""Friend of Ours."" It's a reference to the spark you feel when someone brushes against you or you find yourself in close quarters with a bunch of strangers. For Hoop it helped her understand that the personal problems we often hide from others are more universal than we realize. ""Shoulder Charge"" is from her upcoming album, Stonechild, due out July 5 on Memphis Industries. YouTube Sevdaliza Song: Martyr
Sevdaliza, the Iranian-born, Dutch singer has been sharing her poetry and songs since 2012, and on her debut album ISON in 2017. Now she's releasing a series of videos and songs under the title ""Duorum: Lover's Mourn."" ""Martyr"" is the second song in the series and was inspired by a period of personal self-discovery.
"" The Darkest Hour "" was the first installment and dealt with the lack of diversity Sevdaliza sees in the music industry. YouTube Chris Staples Song: Everybody Said
Chris Staples is a gifted storyteller who reveals life's greatest mysteries in humanity's smallest moments. On the surface, ""Everybody Said,"" from his just-announced album Holy Moly, is a short, simple tale of young love. But it speaks volumes about the elusive passing of time and how we often lose track of ourselves in the imperceptible shifts that unfold in each passing day. Holy Moly is out June 28 on Barsuk. YouTube Vera Sola Song: Loving, Loving (Acoustic Reprise)
Vera Sola is an artist with a vision. On her late 2018 debut album Shades , all of the instruments and the singing and writing was her own. On this new song ""Loving, Loving (Acoustic Reprise)"" she is joined by Kenneth Pattengale of The Milk Carton Kids on guitar, sounding more like a dampened piano. In an audio recording, she sent us from a van while on tour in Germany she said, ""my instruction was that he play it as if he were manipulating the sound of a clock as heard through or under water. And since the song was originally written as a sort of sea shanty that's probably where the impulse came from."" ""Loving, Loving (Acoustic Reprise)"" is the b-side to the single ""Crooked Houses."" YouTube Pip Blom Song: Set of Stairs
Pip Blom is a young singer from Amsterdam and the namesake of her band, which also features her brother, Tender Blom, on guitar. Together they make wonderfully idiosyncratic rock with the kind of wry observations you might hear in the music of Courtney Barnett. ""Set of Stairs"" is a three-minute cheer to keep going when life gets you down. Sometimes you get an easy ride on an elevator... and sometimes you get a long, hard climb up a flight of stairs. Pip Blom's debut album, Boat, is due out May 31 on Heavenly Recordings. "
Gary Clark Jr.: Tiny Desk Concert,www.npr.org,,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/11/712350241/gary-clark-jr-tiny-desk-concert,"Don't see the video above? Click here. Gary Clark Jr. had good reason to sweat. The blues-rock singer and guitarist opted to play his first-ever Tiny Desk concert — in front of a huge crowd that warmed the room considerably — while clad in a thick knit cap and heavy jacket. Plus, he'd brought his young son on tour with him and had to contend with a traditional parenting dilemma: How do you bring your kid to the office and still get work done?
But once Clark and his formidable band got done cranking out three songs from this year's blistering This Land , he wasn't the only one in the room who needed to wipe away the sweat. Clark's set leaned toward some of This Land 's softer sentiments — ""When I'm Gone"" is about missing his family on the road, while ""Pearl Cadillac"" exudes gratitude for his mother's sacrifices — leaving its more politically incendiary material for louder live shows. But these songs still roared with the assurance and force of a showman at the top of his game.

Amazon Independent Booksellers Read an excerpt of Late Bloomers
It seems like every week a video shared on social media shows some incredibly early achiever: a 5-year-old playing a piano concerto; an 11-year-old college graduate; the preteen sports prodigy.
But in the new book Late Bloomers: The Power of Patience in a World Obsessed with Early Achievement, Forbes magazine publisher Rich Karlgaard isn't so interested in young achievers. Instead, Karlgaard looks at those for whom success comes later — in their 30s, 40s, 50s and beyond — in a culture obsessed with early achievement. He makes the case that while we can surely celebrate the phenoms, the premise that early blooming is necessary for lifelong success is flawed.
""Some people are naturally gifted, focused prodigies. I have nothing against them — in fact, I applaud them,"" he tells NPR. ""The problem arises when we think that's the path that's appropriate for all kids, teens and young adults.""
Interview Highlights On how human cognitive development informs blooming
If you look at what neuroscience has to say — and there was a great 2015 study , and they looked at: What do we do best during each decade of our life? And sure enough ... our rapid synaptic processing speed and working memory peak in our 20s. But then in our 30s, 40s and 50s we begin to develop a whole range of skills we didn't have before: executive functioning, management skills, compassion, equanimity. ... Wisdom really begins to kick in in our 50s, 60s and 70s.
On the obsession with early success
Music Reviews 100 Years Of Woody Herman: The Early Bloomer Who Kept Blooming Where I live in Silicon Valley, it's kind of ground central for putting pressure on teens and young adults because there are so many examples of young adults who have gone out and done tremendous things — whether it's the two founders of Google, whether it's Mark Zuckerberg at Facebook. The pressure that this is putting on kids, teens and parents is incredible. So this pressure cooker and this idea that we're putting kids on a conveyor belt and they're supposed to trade their youthful curiosity for determined focus is having, on the whole, I believe a very bad outcome — and that's why I wanted to start a national conversation about this.
On how he sees ambition
Movies Meet Marsai Martin, The Youngest Executive Producer In Hollywood Music Interviews On Charles Bradley: Sweaty Hugs And Screams 'From The Center Of The Earth' I think ambition is good. Some people will really respond to ambition. There are people who — and this characterizes most early bloomers, I think — they're naturally ambitious, they're naturally competitive, they like to win, they like to impress people, they like to run up the score. ... Late bloomers tend to be more of the explorer type. I do poorly when I'm under competitive pressure. I do much better when I explore my curiosity. It's the difference between feeling being pushed — which I don't like and I think a lot of people don't like — versus being pulled by some vision and dream and higher purpose.

2019 Pulitzer Prizes Are Announced By Columbia University,www.npr.org,,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/16/713798984/2019-pulitzer-prizes-are-announced-by-columbia-university,"Winners were picked in 14 journalism categories plus 7 in arts, letters and music. Each prize gets $15,000 and the Public Service winner, the South Florida Sun-Sentinel , also received a gold medal.
DAVID GREENE, HOST:
The most prestigious awards in American journalism were announced yesterday. And for some of the winners, the announcement was full of joy.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER: The prize is awarded to Matt Hamilton...
(CHEERING)
GREENE: That was the newsroom of the Los Angeles Times after they learned three of their reporters won the Pulitzer Prize for investigative reporting.
STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:
In other newsrooms that were honored, the mood was somber.
BRITTANY WALLMAN: A lot of us burst right into tears. It was a bittersweet moment. A lot of us can't talk about it without getting emotional because we've been exposed to so much of the sadness.
INSKEEP: The sadness that Brittany Wallman and others covered at the South Florida Sun Sentinel. That paper received the award for public service for covering the Parkland school shooting. Wallman says that one of the victim's fathers texted her after the win.
WALLMAN: When you finish being happy today about your award, please get right back to this story, and don't stop.
GREENE: And the newsroom of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette was also melancholy. They won the award for breaking news coverage for the Tree of Life Synagogue shooting in October. Keith Burris is executive editor of the paper.
KEITH BURRIS: The word everyone is using today is bittersweet. And I think that's an almost ridiculous understatement.
GREENE: He stressed that the paper's reporting on the shooting was a total team effort.
BURRIS: I don't think a single member of the news staff failed to make a contribution.
INSKEEP: Now, the local reporting award went to the staff at The Advocate in Baton Rouge, La., which exposed the effects of a Jim Crow-era law. It allowed courts in the state to send defendants to jail without a unanimous verdict on guilt or innocence. Gordon Russell is the managing editor for investigations at The Advocate.
GORDON RUSSELL: I think the biggest achievement for us out of all this was getting the law changed. And not that we did that by ourselves, but I think that we played a role in that. And that was really what we set out to do, was to shine a light on this.
GREENE: And a special citation went to the staff of The Capital Gazette in Annapolis, Md. In June of last year, a gunman killed five journalists there. Their colleagues still got the paper out the very next day.

What Does It Mean To Be A Normal Person?,www.npr.org,,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/16/713798970/what-does-it-mean-to-be-a-normal-person,"That is the question a the heart of the new book — Normal People — from the acclaimed Irish novelist Sally Rooney. She talks to NPR's Rachel Martin.
STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:
What does it mean to be normal? It's the question at the heart of a new book from the Irish writer Sally Rooney. ""Normal People"" follows the relationship of two young students, Connell and Marianne, who share an intense affection for one another but cannot figure out just how to be together. Sally Rooney tells Rachel Martin that the character's relationship shapes their own identities.
SALLY ROONEY: The opening phase of their relationship, when they're in secondary school, is, for various reasons, kept a secret. And even though that secrecy is in a way a little bit oppressive for both of them, I think it's also in a strange way kind of liberating because it means that their relationship is kept apart from the social world and kept protected from it, in a sense. And they find new ways to express themselves and to kind of carve out an identity or a sense of self just for one other person.
You know, they're at that age where they're really trying to figure out who they are going to be as adults. You know, they're 17, 18, 19. They don't really know themselves very well yet. And so, yeah, I think their intimacy is a really formative part of how they develop an identity in those years.
RACHEL MARTIN, BYLINE: They are each suffering in some way. Is that what continues to draw them to one another over time? Do they recognize that in each other?
ROONEY: Yeah, I mean, it is certainly true that both of them suffer. But then, to what extent do they suffer more than others, you know? I mean, I think it's probably true that everyone around them is suffering too. And maybe they're not attuned to the suffering of other people as much as they are to their own.
And maybe, at that age, for some reason they offer one another a window into each other's lives that, when they look around them at other people in their social lives, in their families, among their friends, they just don't seem to be able to see through other people in the same way that they can see through each other. So maybe it is that they can instinctively recognize that there is a commonality in the kind of suffering that they're experiencing and that they're just not able to recognize that commonality in other people, necessarily.
MARTIN: I guess that's also what struck me, is that they don't seem that self-aware, which is kind of what it means to be an 18-year-old or a 20-year-old, that your own perception of your pain is all-encompassing and perhaps disproportionate to the kind of suffering or pain that other people have.
ROONEY: Yeah. I mean, I definitely think there are moments in the book where their self-awareness fails hugely. And it may be, you know, because they are very young. I mean, they're almost children when we meet them. And then, when we leave them, they're 22.
But it may also just be that that's what people are like - or, I suppose, that's what these people are like. I mean, I don't know, if we met Connell and Marianne down the road 20 years later, that they wouldn't necessarily still be trying to learn some of the same lessons. Like, I don't think that it's necessarily age-limited. It may just be individual-limited, in the sense that that's just the kind of people that they are, I think.
MARTIN: I'd like to ask about two specific pivot points in the plot. Connell and Marianne grow up together in the same community, and they are affected by the social strata that puts them into various groups, locks them there. What happens when they go to college? They end up going to the same place, right?
ROONEY: Right. So Marianne has kind of convinced Connell to apply for the same university that she's going to, which is the university in Dublin. And he does. Then their relationship, in the meantime, has completely fallen apart. So they're not even on speaking terms, but they both end up going to the same university. And of course, inevitably, because Dublin is small and because this college is small, they do run into one another. And when they do, they're meeting each other in a very different social context with, you know, having developed kind of different identities in the meantime.
So Marianne, who was a social pariah in secondary school, has now become a little bit popular, almost celebrated, whereas Connell, who had so many things going for him in school, finds that the particular forms of masculinity - I suppose, specifically working-class masculinity - just isn't really available for exchange in this social environment. It's just not working for him. And he feels, like, very confused and puzzled as to why he can no longer trade on the same kinds of charisma that apparently were so effective when he was in school, and he does feel very lost. So the social positions that they were in seemed to have almost exchanged themselves completely.
MARTIN: And then I wanted to ask about another moment where things change for them. When Marianne goes to Sweden, things seem to shift profoundly again then.
ROONEY: Yeah. So Marianne takes an Erasmus year, which is like a program where you can study abroad for a year. And she goes to Lund in Sweden, and Connell stays behind in Trinity. And during that period, they're both suffering, I think, not simply or not even primarily because they're apart. But it does mean that the kinds of suffering that they encounter, they don't necessarily have the same coping mechanism they might have if they were together because they're so used to sort of having each other on hand to work through all the various crises they encounter, many of which are caused by one another.
MARTIN: (Laughter).
ROONEY: And so when they're apart, I think it is - it's different for them.
MARTIN: You have noted a couple times in the course of our conversation that, for you, writing this story, it's not like you had agency over every development, that you were, in fact, just kind of observing the characters in the tale that was unfolding before you. And I wonder if it's - does it just stop when you finish the last page, or do you find yourself continuing to watch that story unfold? I mean, do you imagine who these people are in middle age, for example?
ROONEY: Yeah. I mean, it's funny. Certainly, when I finished the book, I was still very much with the characters in my mind. And I found these two very hard to let go of, I mean, just because, I suppose, in one sense I spent so much time with them in my brain that I was kind of used to relying on them, in a way. And they - so they did stay with me, definitely. But since then, I've started working on new things. And I guess I spend most of my time now with sort of new imaginary people in my brain.
MARTIN: (Laughter).
ROONEY: And I don't find myself returning to Connell and Marianne in quite the same way or quite so often. But I don't necessarily think it would be impossible for me to return to them substantially later on and sort of find out what they're up to. Like, I do (laughter) like the idea that they're kind of there and that I can check in with them to see what happens in their later lives because I suppose, to me, whether or not I did justice to this in the book - I can't obviously say - but to me, they really did feel like full human beings, as it were.
MARTIN: Yeah.
ROONEY: So I almost believe that they are out there having a life and that it's just - maybe my job, down the line, is to check in and see whatever became of them.
MARTIN: The novel is called ""Normal People,"" written by Sally Rooney. Sally, thank you so much.
ROONEY: Thank you so much for having me. Thank you.

Democratic Presidential Contenders Release Tax Returns,www.npr.org,,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/16/713798954/democratic-presidential-contenders-release-tax-returns,"Democratic Presidential Contenders Release Tax Returns Democratic Presidential Contenders Release Tax Returns Embed Embed
A number of 2020 Democratic presidential candidates are putting out several years of their tax returns — that's much earlier than presidential hopefuls have in past campaigns.
DAVID GREENE, HOST:
During past presidential elections, it's been pretty standard for major party nominees to release tax returns. In 2016, President Trump became the first general election candidate in more than four decades to keep his private. Now, since then Democrats have been pushing for the release of his documents. As that's been happening, a number of 2020 contenders are putting out several years of their returns earlier than hopefuls have in the past. And this includes Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris and, as of last night, Bernie Sanders and Beto O'Rourke.
NPR lead political editor Domenico Montanaro is here. Hi, Domenico.
DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Good morning, David.
GREENE: So what numbers should we be paying attention to?
MONTANARO: Well, when we look at these tax returns, we're really looking at three things as top-line numbers to pay attention to. One, income. Second, tax rates. In other words, how much do people pay in taxes? And three, how much do they give to charity? That charitable giving number. What we found out of these things is Kamala Harris' household has the highest income. She and her husband were taxed at the highest rate, as well. Beto O'Rourke, the former congressman, with his wife, they have pretty significant assets and investments. And according to his 2017 tax return, which is the latest that we have, he didn't give very much to charity of - past financial disclosures have found that he's worth almost $10 million. Elizabeth Warren was the most charitable candidate, gave about $50,000 to charity, or about 6 percent of her total household income.
A notable finding, though, from these returns was what it showed about Bernie Sanders. You know, for years, we've talked about how the Vermont independent senator has been one of the least-wealthy members of Congress. He's railed against millionaires and billionaires. But he seems to have cashed in on his 2016 campaign. He wrote a book that made him lots of money. In fact, he made over a million dollars in the years subsequent to the 2016 campaign, a little less in 2018. And that was something he was asked about during a town hall on Fox News last night. Let's take a listen.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
BERNIE SANDERS: It was a bestseller. It sold all over the world, and we made money. So if anyone thinks that I should apologize for writing a bestselling book, I'm sorry. I'm not going to do it.
GREENE: Bernie Sanders is not saying he's sorry.
MONTANARO: Exactly. He's defending his book that was - that he wrote that helped make all that money for him. And I have to say, for a democratic socialist, that was a pretty capitalistic response.
GREENE: (Laughter). Are we going to start hearing from more of the Democrats?
MONTANARO: We probably are. We haven't heard from some notable candidates, like Pete Buttigieg, the South Bend, Ind., mayor, or Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, but they've pledged to release them soon. And Booker, in the past, has released some 15 years of tax returns.
GREENE: And no tax returns, as I mentioned, from President Trump yet. But we are getting some fundraising numbers for the president.
MONTANARO: That's right. And he's raised $30 million for his campaign, most from political committees - all that joint fundraising - think about - that he does at these rallies for the RNC. He's got about $41 million cash on hand. Just $4 million, though, we have to say, comes from small donors, which stands in pretty stark contrast with Democrats, who are drawing a pretty significant share from the grassroots, and they've made that a real focus.
GREENE: NPR lead political editor Domenico Montanaro. Thanks, Domenico.
MONTANARO: You're so welcome. Copyright © 2019 NPR. All rights reserved. Visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.

Scientists Plan To Start Human Trials Testing CRISPER Soon,www.npr.org,,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/16/713798944/scientists-plan-to-start-human-trials-testing-crisper-soon,"The powerful gene-editing technique is moving out of the lab and into the clinic. Trials will use CRISPR to try to treat a variety of diseases, ranging from cancer and blindness to blood disorders.
STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:
We have news of a new way to attack cancer. NPR has learned that doctors have used a powerful new gene editing technique in cancer treatment in the United States for the first time. That news is just the latest about the technique called CRISPR. Some news has troubled much of the world, as when a Chinese scientist announced last year that he used CRISPR to create genetically modified babies. Now this less controversial news. NPR health correspondent Rob Stein sat down with Rachel Martin.
RACHEL MARTIN, BYLINE: OK. Rob, let's start off big-picture. Remind us all what CRISPR is, exactly.
ROB STEIN, BYLINE: CRISPR, basically, is an entirely new kind of genetic engineering that gives scientists the power to edit DNA, make precise changes in DNA much more easily than ever before. So scientists think CRISPR could revolutionize medicine, the way we prevent and treat many diseases, by doing things like fixing genetic defects or modifying the genes inside cells or basically turning them into drugs.
MARTIN: So is that what that Chinese scientist was doing?
STEIN: He used CRISPR to edit the genes inside human embryos, and that means any change he made could be passed down for generations to come. In this case, for medical treatments, the modifications are only being made in the DNA of individual patients. So it doesn't raise all those ""Brave New World"" scenarios about re-engineering the human race.
MARTIN: OK. So explain what is happening now.
STEIN: Yeah. So what's happening now is we finally reached the moment when CRISPR is moving out of the lab and into the clinic, around the world, for medical treatments. Until now, there's only been a small number of studies where scientists have tried to use CRISPR to treat disease, and they've almost all been in China to treat cancer. Now scientists in Europe, the United States and Canada are launching a wave of studies to try to use CRISPR to treat a variety of diseases. Here's Fyodor Urnov. He's a scientist at the Altius Institute for Biomedical Sciences in Seattle.
FYODOR URNOV: 2019 is the year when the training wheels come off and the world gets to see what CRISPR can really do for the world in the most positive sense.
MARTIN: OK. So what does that mean? What diseases are we talking about here?
STEIN: Yeah. So the first are blood disorders, like sickle cell disease and a similar condition, a genetic condition known as beta thalassemia. And in fact, the first beta thalassemia patient was just recently treated in Germany, and more are about to get their blood cells CRISPR-ed soon at a second hospital in Germany. Then there'll be patients treated in Toronto, in London. And the first sickle cell disease patients could start to get the DNA in their blood cells edited in this country really soon.
And there's yet another noteworthy study, and that's a study that's going to try to treat an inherited form of blindness. And the reason that's noteworthy is because this would be the first time scientists try to use CRISPR to edit the genes inside the human body. The other studies involve removing cells from patients, editing them in the lab and then infusing the modified cells back into patient's body.
MARTIN: Wow. So those are all very important conditions and diseases. What about cancer, though?
STEIN: Well, Rachel, one study involving CRISPR is underway in the United States to treat cancer. It's at the University of Pennsylvania. And I just learned that two patients have been treated there for multiple myeloma and sarcoma. But several other cancer studies may be starting soon involving CRISPR this year in places like Texas and New York.
MARTIN: OK. So all of that is exciting. All of that seems like very positive, good news. But is there a dark underbelly here? I mean, are there concerns about it?
STEIN: Well, sure. You know, whenever you try something completely new and something as powerful as this, people always get a little bit nervous that something could go wrong. Everybody remembers the early days of gene therapy when some patients, you know, even died. Here's Laurie Zoloth. She's a bioethicist at University of Chicago I talked to about this.
LAURIE ZOLOTH: Every human on the planet should hope that this technology works. But it might work. It might not. It's unknown. This is an experiment. So you do need exquisite layers of care, and you need to really think in advance with a careful ethical review how do you do this sort of work.
MARTIN: All right. So do we have any sense of when we will know if these CRISPR treatments are working?
STEIN: Yeah. So all these studies are really early. They're very preliminary. And they're aimed primarily at testing whether these experimental CRISPR treatments are safe. That said, the scientists are looking for clues about whether they might be helping patients. So we could get a glimmer of that sometime later this year or maybe early next year.
MARTIN: NPR health correspondent Rob Stein. Thanks so much, Rob.
STEIN: Thanks, Rachel.

The U.S., North and South Koreas have said they're willing to hold more talks to try to resolve the nuclear crisis. At the same time, the prospects for a diplomatic breakthrough are looking slim.
DAVID GREENE, HOST:
The leaders of the United States, North and South Korea have all said in recent days that they are willing to hold more summits to resolve the ongoing nuclear crisis. At the same time, the prospects for a diplomatic breakthrough are looking increasingly dire. NPR's Anthony Kuhn has more from Seoul.
ANTHONY KUHN, BYLINE: Just back from a meeting with President Trump in Washington, President Moon Jae-in told his aides Monday that it's time to prepare for a fourth summit with his North Korean counterpart Kim Jong Un, which would hopefully lead to a third summit between Kim and Trump. The last one ended in February in Vietnam without an agreement.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
PRESIDENT MOON JAE-IN: (Speaking Korean).
KUHN: ""As soon as North Korea's ready,"" Moon said, ""I hope the two Koreas will be able to sit down together regardless of venue and format and hold detailed and substantive talks."" But Pyongyang insists it doesn't need anyone, especially not Seoul, to broker talks. Andrei Lankov, a Russian expert on North Korea at Kookmin University in Seoul, says this puts Moon in a tough spot. His political fortunes are tied to the North Korean issue, and economic growth at home is weak.
ANDREI LANKOV: I would expect that North Koreans would not welcome another summit because they are not going to save President Moon Jae-in from growing domestic trouble.
KUHN: Meanwhile, in Pyongyang last week, Kim Jong Un said he's willing to meet with Trump again, but not if Trump tries to dictate the terms of a deal like he did in Hanoi. He says he'll give the U.S. until year's end to come up with a better offer. Lankov says Kim could just wait out the Trump administration, but he also realizes that Trump represents a rare opportunity.
LANKOV: He is probably the only American president for the foreseeable future who will be willing to tacitly, implicitly accept North Korea as a nuclear power.
KUHN: Kim is also likely to hold his first summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin soon. It makes sense for him to line up support from allies. But the problem, says Lankov, is that Kim doesn't really have any. He says China has the money to keep Pyongyang afloat, but it's not willing to risk violating sanctions.
LANKOV: In Russia, don't count on more than - I don't know - 10 rubles or maybe 100 rubles, which will buy you a cup of coffee in Moscow coffeeshop.
KUHN: He adds that with little money to spend on conventional military forces, Moscow is particularly reliant on nukes, so it may be even more worried about nuclear proliferation than the U.S. Anthony Kuhn, NPR News, Seoul.

The sound there of Parisians gathering last night on the banks of the Seine river, singing hymns, praying. Across the water, fire and smoke rose from Notre Dame Cathedral.
STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:
This house of worship was begun in the middle ages, took centuries to build. Nobody who began the work could have lived to see it complete. It survived many wars, and it lasted long enough to appear in the photos of giddy tourists who came from nations that did not even exist when the cathedral was started. Though fire collapsed its spire yesterday, the crews who put out the flames discovered parts of the cathedral still standing.

PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: (Speaking French).
INSKEEP: French President Emmanuel Macron there, saying that the cathedral is part of the country's history, its literature and its psyche.
GREENE: And let's turn to NPR's correspondent based in Paris, Eleanor Beardsley, who joins us this morning and watched all of this unfold yesterday. Hi, Eleanor.
ELEANOR BEARDSLEY, BYLINE: Hi.
GREENE: So where exactly are you, and what does it feel like in Paris this morning?
BEARDSLEY: It's very somber. You know, I got up this morning, and I thought, Notre Dame has been ravaged. And it was a weird feeling knowing that. And I came down here, and I'm sitting on a bench beside the river. And I'm looking at the charred stone of a stained glass window. And there's no spire anymore. And there's hundreds of people out, Parisians and tourists, just standing here, solemnly taking pictures and looking at the damage.
GREENE: How bad is the damage in terms of what we know at this point? I mean, can this cathedral be fully rebuilt?
BEARDSLEY: Well, it is very extensive, the damage. Just this morning, they were showing footage of inside the cathedral. And it's shocking. We still see heaps of rubble that are smoking, destroyed art figures. And the roof is said to be two-thirds destroyed, and the cathedral is open to the sky. So it's going to cost hundreds of millions of dollars. And they're estimating it could take more than a decade to rebuild it.
GREENE: I mean, you talk about money. There are just priceless collections of art and relics. I mean, was much of that saved in this fire?
BEARDSLEY: You know, they were able to save a crown of thorns and Saint Louis' tunic, those are two big things they're naming. They've stacked what they've saved next door in the Hotel de Ville. But they're still inside this morning, trying to get artwork out. It's dangerous work because cinders were still falling. You know, beams were still falling inside the church. And they're still trying to secure it. The fire has been pronounced officially out, and - but it's still cooling down. They're still saving things. So we don't know the - you know, exactly what's (inaudible) right now.
GREENE: So you said you're sitting on a bench, looking over at the cathedral, other people along with you taking all this in this morning. I mean, what are people saying in terms of the meaning of what happened yesterday?
BEARDSLEY: You know, people are just so shocked. They're saying a thousand years of history just went up in a couple hours. People are moved - not just French people, but from across the world. I spoke this morning to a South African tourist, Peto Foster (ph) and here's what he told me...
PETO FOSTER: It was quite amazing to be inside on Sunday. And then last night, we came back when it - while it was burning and now for the after effect. We were actually walking around here this morning just saying how somber the mood is. It's almost quiet as you come into the area in comparison to the other areas in Paris.
GREENE: The voice of one Parisian there speaking to NPR's Eleanor Beardsley, who like so many people in Paris are just trying to understand all of this, what happened yesterday at Notre Dame. Eleanor, thank you so much.
BEARDSLEY: Thank you, David.
(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)
GREENE: So during past presidential elections it's been pretty standard for major party nominees to release their tax returns.
INSKEEP: In 2016, candidate Donald Trump became the first general election candidate in more than four decades who did not keep a promise to release them. Democrats in Congress have more recently requested his taxes, citing their authority under the law. Although, the White House is resisting. As it's happening, 2020 presidential contenders are putting out several years of their own returns. They include, among others, Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris and, as of last night, Bernie Sanders and Beto O'Rourke.
GREENE: And one person following all of the numbers, NPR lead political editor Domenico Montanaro, who is with us. Hey, Domenico.
DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Good morning.
GREENE: So anything standing out to you so far?
MONTANARO: Well, look, when we look at these tax returns, we're looking at three things to start off with - one, income, two, tax rate - what they pay in taxes - and three, their charitable giving. So just a few top lines from this so far. Kamala Harris' household was the highest income, and they were taxed at the highest rate. Beto O'Rourke and his wife have significant assets and investments and, according to his 2017 tax return, didn't give a whole lot to charity. And Elizabeth Warren, she was the most charitable. But a notable finding from these tax returns was what it showed about Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent senator. For years and years he's been one of the least wealthy members of Congress. But since his 2016 campaign, he was able to cash in on a book that he wrote, ""Here We Go From Here"" (ph). And he has lambasted millionaires and billionaires, as we know, for years - but guess what? After 2016, he made over a million dollars in some of those years. And that was something he was asked about during a town hall on Fox News last night. Let's take a listen...
(SOUNDBITE OF FOX NEWS BROADCAST)
BERNIE SANDERS: It was a bestseller. It sold all over the world, and we made money. So if anyone thinks that I should apologize for writing a bestselling book, I'm sorry. I'm not going to do it.
GREENE: Wow.
MONTANARO: Well, that's pretty classic Bernie Sanders. And I have to say, for a democratic socialist, that was a pretty capitalistic answer.
GREENE: Should he be worried? I mean, could this come back to bite him if he has a lot of money and still has this populist message?
MONTANARO: Well, he's also raising a ton of money from grassroots and from the base. So he clearly has a huge depth of support still from his base. And this does not look like it's derailing him whatsoever.
GREENE: OK. So who have we not heard from at this point, and is there a reason? Like, are people deciding that they don't want to release these tax returns?
MONTANARO: Well, they're complicated. But we haven't heard from about a dozen others, like Pete Buttigieg, for example, the South Bend, Ind., mayor, Cory Booker of New Jersey. But everyone's pledging to release them soon. Booker, for example, has released previously 15 years of tax returns.
GREENE: And there's this really high-profile person running for president in 2020 who we definitely haven't seen tax returns from. That's the president of the United States.
MONTANARO: Right.
GREENE: Is that going - where does that stand? And have we learned anything? I mean, we are getting some fundraising numbers from him.
MONTANARO: Well, Democrats are certainly trying to push to get his tax returns released. Democrats on Capitol Hill have been filing formal requests trying to get those. There's no sign that the president's going to do so. At this point, he said that he's not inclined to do it. But as far as his campaign fundraising goes, he's raised $30 million, most of that from political committees, just $4 million from small donors, which stands in stark contrast with Democrats who are trying to draw a significant share from the grassroots.
GREENE: Any evidence in this long battle over the president's tax returns that it's hurting him politically to keep them away from people?
MONTANARO: Not with his base, you know, and that's - we've never seen a president who has focused more on his base to try to win re-election.
GREENE: NPR lead political editor Domenico Montanaro. Thanks, Domenico.
MONTANARO: You're so welcome.
(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)
GREENE: Let's look back to the year 2000. Measles was declared officially eliminated from the United States after a full year of no transmissions.
INSKEEP: But now the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is seeing the virus return. New numbers were released yesterday and so far 555 cases - 555 - have been reported this year alone. New York City last week declared a public health emergency. New York's Herminia Palacio, Deputy Mayor of Health and Human Services asked parents to do more.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
HERMINIA PALACIO: When you make the decision not to vaccinate your child, please understand you are also making that decision for the people around your child.
GREENE: OK, so what exactly is causing the spike in cases? NPR global health correspondent Michaeleen Doucleff has been tracking all of this. Hi, Michaeleen.
MICHAELEEN DOUCLEFF, BYLINE: Hello, good morning.
GREENE: So put this outbreak in perspective. How bad is this?
DOUCLEFF: Yeah, so 555 cases is actually about 50 percent more cases than we saw for the entire year last year. It's also the second-biggest outbreak we've had since - in more than two decades.
GREENE: Wow. So that's significant.
DOUCLEFF: Yeah, yeah. It is significant when you - when the CDC also says that it's going to grow, right? This thing is getting worse. They actually - one of the health officials I talked to said that it's accelerating, so...
GREENE: And this has been largely New York City, is that right? Or are there other spots where this is coming up?
DOUCLEFF: Yeah. So about 400 of those cases, the vast majority, are linked to two outbreaks in New York - one in Brooklyn and one in Rockland County, north of the city. As you mentioned before, the city has declared a public health emergency and is actually calling for mandatory vaccinations. So adults and kids have to get vaccinated, else families could be fined. The CDC also points to outbreaks in Washington state, Michigan, New Jersey and several parts of California.
GREENE: OK, so the big question - why. Why the surge now?
DOUCLEFF: Yeah, so health officials say that really two things are working together to amplify the problem. First of all, there's actually a surge of measles around the world right now. The World Health Organization just said this week that there have been four times as many cases reported this year as there were at the same time last year. And several countries have these massive outbreaks right now, with tens of thousands of cases, just to put our 500 cases into a global perspective.
GREENE: Yeah.
DOUCLEFF: Ukraine and Madagascar have, you know, tens of thousands of cases. There are also significant outbreaks in Israel, several countries in the European Union and Indonesia.
GREENE: So we...
DOUCLEFF: So, yeah - go ahead.
GREENE: Go ahead.
DOUCLEFF: So the CDC thinks that more Americans are traveling to these countries and bringing them home. But then there's another problem here back at home, is that some communities here, the vaccination rates have really dropped significantly in the past few years - below the level needed to protect the whole community. And so once the virus lands here, it has more of a chance of getting a foothold and triggering an outbreak.
GREENE: Well, and that's what we heard there from the deputy mayor of New York City, suggesting that parents are not just protecting their children; they're protecting other children by making a decision about vaccinations. What other advice would - are people giving to parents?
DOUCLEFF: Yeah, so check to make sure your kids have two doses of the vaccine. You really need two doses to get the full protection. And also, if you are living in an out - where the outbreak is or around it, there - some health officials are calling for babies to get vaccinated a little bit earlier, around six months instead of the typical 12 months. But really the key is vaccination. Measles is super, super contagious. And everybody needs to be protected in order for the - for an outbreak not to occur.
GREENE: All right, NPR global health correspondent Michaeleen Doucleff for us this morning. Thanks so much.
DOUCLEFF: Thank you.

"New Zealand, Red Cross Argue Over Release Of Hostage Nurse's Name : NPR",www.npr.org,Francesca Paris,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/16/713793549/red-cross-releases-name-of-nurse-taken-hostage-new-zealand-fears-for-her-safety,"April 16, 2019 5:38 AM ET Francesca Paris
New Zealand nurse Louisa Akavi, pictured here in an undated photo, was captured in Syria in 2013. Her name was kept secret until Sunday. International Committee of the Red Cross via AP hide caption toggle caption International Committee of the Red Cross via AP New Zealand nurse Louisa Akavi, pictured here in an undated photo, was captured in Syria in 2013. Her name was kept secret until Sunday. International Committee of the Red Cross via AP
For more than five years, New Zealand kept secret the name of a nurse considered a hostage of the Islamic State.
Now Louisa Akavi's name is public.
The International Committee of the Red Cross hopes that releasing her name will lead to her rescue. But New Zealand's government sees it as a threat to her safety, Foreign Minister Winston Peters made clear on Tuesday.
Following Akavi's kidnapping in 2013 while she was working for the ICRC in Syria, news outlets around the world withheld her name and nationality. That changed on Sunday, after the ICRC published a plea for information on her whereabouts, using her name and sparking a back-and-forth between the humanitarian institution and New Zealand.
On Monday, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said the government would have preferred that ""this case were not in the public domain.""
The ICRC responded that it would not have made its decision without the support of the New Zealand government.
Now Peters says that claim is ""balderdash.""
He told reporters on Tuesday morning local time that the government opposed the public release of her name.
""It's not true,"" he said of the ICRC's response, according to The New Zealand Herald . ""The reality is the media people we have worked with very closely ... all know we have been strenuous about keeping this secret in the interests of trying to preserve a chance to retrieve or save this woman, and that's still our view.""
Peters said the government opposes any steps that might endanger the 62-year-old midwife and nurse or impede her release, The Associated Press reports. New Zealand also fears making her a high profile captive, and therefore increasing the odds that her captors would execute her for propaganda.
But the ICRC argued that naming her would raise the chances of receiving news about her whereabouts, following the collapse of the Islamic State.
Akavi was taken hostage while traveling in northwestern Syria, along with two Syrian nationals, Alaa Rajab and Nabil Bakdounes, according to the ICRC.
""Louisa is a true and compassionate humanitarian,"" said Dominik Stillhart, ICRC's director of operations, in the statement released Sunday. ""Alaa and Nabil were committed colleagues and an integral part of our aid deliveries. We call on anyone with information to please come forward.""
Akavi spent much of her life working across the world for the New Zealand Red Cross and the ICRC. She worked with Vietnamese refugees in Malaysia, promoted health and hygiene among local women in Afghanistan and survived a brush with death in Chechnya, when gunmen entered a hospital where she was sleeping and killed six people, the Herald reports . Her work also took her to Somalia, Ethiopia and Iraq, among other places.
In 2010, she told the community newspaper Kapiti Observer about working in Bosnia in the mid-'90s. She described entering the city of Tuzla and seeing Bosnians fleeing in the opposite direction.
""It's winter, it's snowing, it's cold,"" she said. ""And I see on the road a child's doll, and then I see some shoes, and then I see all of these families, women and children with their heads covered and vests, probably the thickest vests they own, wearing boots and no gloves, their hands are bare, carrying everything they own.""
Of her work, she told the paper: ""I don't know why I still do it. It's something I do well. I know that I can make a difference, a small difference.""
By 2013, Akavi was working in Syria, in a period of considerable military success and territorial expansion for the Islamic State.
That October, she was in a Red Cross convoy delivering supplies to medical facilities in Idlib, according to the ICRC. Gunmen stopped the vehicles and took Akavi, Rajab and Bakdounes — along with four other people who were released the following day.
ISIS demanded ransom from the Red Cross in fluctuating amounts, starting at under $1.1 million and rising at times to over $22 million, according to The New York Times . The ICRC told the Times that Akavi's captors answered proof-of-life questions, convincing the humanitarian institution that they were in fact holding the nurse captive.
According to the Herald , Akavi's captors also emailed her family in New Zealand demanding a ransom and threatening that media coverage would lead to her death.
That led to her name and nationality becoming a closely held secret. The de facto blackout was overseen for some time by then-Foreign Minister Murray McCully, who would speak with inquiring editorial staff and spell out the possible consequences of publication, the Herald reports. When media outside of the country would publish her name, New Zealand's intelligence partners across the world would reach out and seek cooperation.
On Monday, Ardern thanked reporters for keeping Akavi's name under wraps.
""The decisions that have been made over a period of time by various outlets and journalists has not only been responsible, I think it's been exemplary,"" she said, according to the Herald. ""I'm sure I speak on behalf of successive governments when I say 'thank you.' ""
Ardern also said that she hoped the misunderstanding wouldn't affect the ongoing search for Akavi or ""undermine"" the relationship between New Zealand and the Red Cross, the Herald reports .
It's unclear whether Akavi, Rajab and Bakdounes are still alive, though the ICRC said it had received ""credible information"" that Akavi was alive late last year.
""Following the fall of the last territory held by Islamic State group, we fear there is an extra risk of losing track of Louisa, though we remain hopeful this period will instead open new opportunities for us to learn more about her whereabouts and wellbeing,"" the ICRC wrote.
The ICRC said it has never been able to learn more details about Rajab and Bakdounes, and their fate is unknown."
Analysts Say Boeing Slow To 'Own' 737 Max Crashes,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/16/713483867/boeing-slow-to-own-recent-air-disasters-analysts-say?station=KXJZ_FM,"Enlarge this image Analysts say Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg and the company were slow to take responsibility in the crashes of two 737 Max planes within months of each other.

toggle caption Anna Moneymaker/Bloomberg via Getty Images Analysts say Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg and the company were slow to take responsibility in the crashes of two 737 Max planes within months of each other.
Anna Moneymaker/Bloomberg via Getty Images After a second 737 Max jet crashed in less than five months, it took Boeing weeks to speak openly about the role its flight control software may have played. Then on April 4, CEO Dennis Muilenburg said: ""It's our responsibility to eliminate this risk. We own it.""
Critics say Muilenburg and Boeing waited too long to say it.
Questions about the safety of the 737 Max trace back to Oct. 29, when an Indonesian Lion Air flight plunged into the Java Sea. At the time, Boeing issued a terse statement extending ""our heartfelt sympathies to the families"" of the 189 victims. It said initial investigations showed the downed 737 Max had faulty data from a sensor.
Business Pilots Split Over FAA Chief's Claims On Boeing 737 Max Training But Boeing also said the same plane flew with the same faulty sensor a day before — and a different crew managed to keep control.
Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a professor at the Yale School of Management, says Boeing's response bordered on pointing a finger at pilots overseas. ""There was a question as to whether or not the pilots followed the right routines initially and if they were properly trained,"" he says.
In the wake of the crash, Boeing put out a bulletin to emphasize what pilots should do in case of a faulty sensor. It did not mention that the sensor feeds an automated flight control software feature called MCAS that was suspected of forcing the Lion Air plane into a nosedive. The FAA certified the 737 Max to fly without requiring pilots to train on or even know about MCAS.
Business Boeing Brings 100 Years Of History To Its Fight To Restore Its Reputation After that business as usual resumed, and orders kept pouring in for the 737 Max, the fastest-selling jet in the company's history.
Then on March 10, a 737 Max flown by Ethiopian Airlines crashed, with 157 casualties.
Over the next two days, countries from China to Europe grounded the planes.
But in the U.S., Boeing's CEO announced that the company was developing an update to its MCAS software, and that the FAA did not require any further action. And Muilenburg even called the White House to say there was no data to support grounding the planes.
Africa Preliminary Crash Report Says Ethiopian Airlines Crew Complied With Procedures Erik Bernstein, vice president of Bernstein Crisis Management in Monrovia, Calif., says this reaction may have aimed to protect Boeing legally. ""You don't want to say something that is then translated in a court of law as an admission of guilt,"" he says.
He says that, in the short term, the tactic could also have financial benefits.
""I would assume that they were selling those planes up to the day they got grounded, or at least attempting to,"" he says. ""They're keeping business partners and investors from being spooked.""
Boeing says it was not avoiding responsibility, but rather waiting for the facts to emerge.
National Boeing Scrambles To Restore Faith In Its 737 Max Airplane After Crashes ""Airplane accident investigations are a tragic, horrific and sad undertaking, but they must be underpinned by fact and data,"" said Boeing spokesman Gordon Johndroe.
Richard Levick, CEO of the Washington-based communications firm Levick, says Boeing's response did not go over well. ""They weren't personal. They weren't empathetic. They were speaking like engineers and they weren't very visible,"" he says.
Levick says Boeing didn't convince the flying public of the plane's safety. A telling moment was when Kayak.com offered passengers an option to filter out the 737 Max from their flight options.

toggle caption Susan Walsh/AP People gather outside Nuss Truck & Equipment in Burnsville, Minn., on April 15 as President Trump arrives for an event to tout his 2017 tax law.
Susan Walsh/AP When the vaunted Democratic blue wall stretching across the Upper Midwest crumbled in Republican Donald Trump's 2016 presidential victory, Minnesota stood out on the map as a holdout.
Now President Trump sees the state as a personal challenge heading into the 2020 election, and his campaign is making it an early target.
No Republican presidential candidate has claimed the state's 10 Electoral College votes since Richard Nixon in 1972 — the longest blue streak of a state in the United States (the District of Columbia has voted for the Democratic presidential nominee since it gained three electoral votes in 1964).
Trump acknowledged the Democratic hold on Minnesota during a quick stop there Monday to tout his signature tax law .
""This has been a very special state. It has been a rare victory for Republicans. And we almost won it,"" Trump said during a visit to a trucking company in Burnsville, a suburb of Minneapolis. He said the result would have been different if he had come more often: ""One more speech.""
Trump used the official White House event, which lasted just over an hour, to speak to local concerns. He addressed proposed mining and pipeline projects in the north, farmers' anxieties in the vast agricultural parts of Minnesota and simmering tensions across the state over immigration. He told the friendly audience he would pursue a health care overhaul ""after the election, assuming you elect Republicans.""
If the 2016 race is a baseline, Trump starts his effort to flip Minnesota in better shape than any Republican in memory.
Politics Sanders' Presidential Campaign To Visit States That Helped Trump In 2016 Trump won 78 of the state's 87 counties . But he still lost to Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton by just 1.5 percentage points. That's in a state where considerably more third-party votes went to right-of-center alternatives — about 6 percent of the presidential votes cast — than those on the left.
Trump's losing margin was closer than any presidential race in the state since 1984, when home-state Democratic nominee Walter Mondale edged Republican President Ronald Reagan by a few thousand votes. Minnesota and Washington, D.C., were the only places that kept Reagan from a clean sweep.
Minnesota Republican Party Chair Jennifer Carnahan said it all adds up to opportunity for Trump.
""We know that the president has strong support from across Minnesota. I think his support is even stronger today than when he ran in 2016,"" she said. ""The more times we can get him back here, the better.""
As the 2020 race ramps up, Minnesota is getting ready for its turn as a presidential battleground and all the candidate visits, ads and persuasion efforts that come with it.

Notre Dame cathedral in Paris was undergoing extensive renovation when Monday's fire broke out. Steve Inskeep talks to Bertrand Badre with the Friends of Notre Dame, which helped fund the renovations.
DAVID GREENE, HOST:
Construction began on Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris more than 800 years ago. Last night, Parisians gathered near that cathedral, hoping there is enough left to rebuild. They prayed, and they sang.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
UNIDENTIFIED CROWD: (Singing in French).
GREENE: The cathedral took nearly 200 years to build, piece by piece - stone, wood, glass. In just a matter of hours, yesterday's fire ravaged some of that history, but not nearly all of it. The fire is out now. The spire is gone, but the recognizable bell towers remain, and many historic structures and artwork survived. Notre Dame had been undergoing extensive renovations, thanks, in part, to Bertrand Badre. He's a board member of the Friends of Notre Dame, the foundation that was created to raise money for the cathedral's renovations. And he joins us on the line this morning. Thanks so much for taking the time.
BERTRAND BADRE: You're welcome. Good morning, everybody.
GREENE: Where were you yesterday when you learned about the fire at Notre Dame, and what were your first thoughts?
BADRE: I was, and I'm still in Shanghai, China. And because of the jetlag or because of some premonition, I woke up in the middle of the night, could not resist to check my phone. And then I cried when I discovered - and I cried again when I discovered what had happened. And all our efforts - and in particular, my wife and I made the decision to take for us the renovation of the cross and the rooster on top of the spire, which is the first thing that collapsed. So it was a real tragedy, not only personally, but for our country, for Paris, and to a certain extent, for the world.
GREENE: Talk to me about this place for people who don't know it well or haven't visited. Like, what's your favorite memory from there?
BADRE: Well, my favorite memory - I have many, actually. The last one and probably the most moving one was my first visit to the top, actually - exactly the part that has burned - so to the very top - the spires, the roof. And what's called behind the roof's a forest, which is a wooden support of the cathedral - everything which has been put to ashes yesterday. And it's like walking in the famous novel of Victor Hugo, ""Notre-Dame De Paris,"" which has been popular by movies and by Walt Disney in particular.
But it's also weird to remember that it's not the first time that Notre Dame has to be rebuilt, actually. Napoleon I was crowned in Notre Dame. So everybody remembers the famous painting of Napoleon crowning himself, actually, and then crowning his wife. And then the cathedral kind of fall apart. And that's because of Victor Hugo - created some, you know, buzz around the cathedral in the early 19th century with his novel. And it was for that purpose that he wrote this novel that finally some money was put to restore and renovate and, to a certain extent, rebuild the cathedral. It had become a storage place, so that's what gives me hope. It's not the first time that this vessel, which is the center of Paris, was - has - I mean, was - motto is (speaking French). It floats, but it never sinks. So this vessel was already about to sink. And I think we can make it work again. But it's such a shock. I mean, it's such a shock.
GREENE: It's just amazing to think about some of the stories. I mean, like the ""Hunchback Of Notre-Dame"" - I mean, think about some of the people and the pull - thinking Joan of Arc - who've had something to do with this place and the history that this cathedral has witnessed, and generations have gone by. It must be hard to imagine this place ever truly being gone. I mean, there's just a resilience there that is incredible.
BADRE: I think we are so lucky that the firemen - and I want to pay tribute to their work - is that they have been capable of stoking the fire, I would say, in due time before the structure itself collapsed. So we are not a repeat of certain collapse. I was in New York on September 11 - you know, this type of humanity - but there is no connection at all. You're afraid that the whole thing will collapse and fortunately, not this time. And that's why I'm confident that we can rebuild it. It will take time, that's for sure. These things don't happen overnight, but it's so central to Paris, you know? It's funny. When I was a kid, we were living 6 kilometers far from Paris. And I asked my dad, what does it mean - 6 kilometers far from where in Paris? Is it from Notre Dame? Every distance in France is calculated out of the center of Notre Dame.
GREENE: All roads lead to Notre Dame.
BADRE: Really the symbol - yes, exactly. It is a symbol. Every city in France - you have a place where you have the kilometers linking the place to Notre Dame in Paris. So it's really the heart of Paris for those who believe in God and for those who don't believe in God. Something more than special - it's really the - that's where our heart beats, I think.
GREENE: It is sounding like the initial reports are this was all an accident. Is that your understanding so far as you talk to people in Paris?
BADRE: Yes, I think it's - I'm glad we can - that's what I hear - that it's not a criminal, not a terrorist - I mean, the usual things we are afraid of when we have this type of accidents. So I suspect investigation will be pursued, and we'll try to see what exactly happens. And we think it's too early days to draw any conclusion, but that - I could only imagine that some criminal or terrorist could target Notre Dame. So I'm glad it's not the case, apparently.
GREENE: What are the important moments or decisions that will have to be made as this process goes forward that will make you feel optimistic that this place will be fully restored at some point?
BADRE: Well, I think compared to my distress in the middle of the Shanghai night, I feel - I still feel immensely sad, but I'm quite hopeful. First, our president was there with the mayor of Paris, the prime minister - everybody was there in the middle of the night to confirm we will rebuild, and we will make it happen. So it's a kind of national project. I mean, this is - again, when you're touched at your heart, you just cannot, I mean, avoid doing the right thing. And it's great. Yeah, I mean, I'm glad to see that gifts are coming. I mean, I was on the fundraising trip for several years, and it was OK. But I'm so relieved to see that, in particular, two French billionaires have committed together more than 300 million euro.
GREENE: Already.
BADRE: So very difficult to say - we are - before the tragedy of yesterday, we had estimated the cost of renovation to be 150 million euros or probably 170 million dollarish (ph). So I suspect it's going to be three or four times this. I mean, it's very early days to say. So it's great that we get these big gift. I suspect more will come. But it's also - it was very moving because I mean, like, many people, like, posted on social networks. And I received so many people, so many friends all over the world, say that, Bertrand, I want to give something small. Where can I go? But I want to be there. So it was amazing to see that Notre Dame was not only something dear to the heart of French and Parisian people like me, but it had some meaning for people spread all over the world, and in the U.S. in particular.
GREENE: Bertrand Badre...
BADRE: That's really something very special.
GREENE: Bertrand Badre, thanks so much.

Amazon Independent Booksellers Such heaps of praise have piled up for Irish writer Sally Rooney, there's a danger of suffocation from avalanching expectations. At 28, the Trinity College Dublin graduate has published two novels, Conversations with Friends (2017) and Normal People , both to the sort of excitement that more typically greets new hand-held electronic devices.
I'm happy to report that Rooney's novels are exciting hand-held devices — new books that bring a 21st century perspective on insecurity to the coming-of-age narrative. Normal People is a compulsive, psychologically astute will-they-or-won't-they love story involving two of the most sympathetic people you're liable to meet between covers. Although hailed as a voice of millennials, Rooney offers plenty to appeal to readers across genders and generations.
Marianne Sheridan and Connell Waldron meet as teens in County Sligo, Ireland. Both are star students, but Marianne is an outcast raised in material wealth and emotional poverty by her widowed mother, a lawyer who apparently deems aggressive behavior from men — including her abusive late husband and nasty son — acceptable. Lower-middle-class Connell lives way across town with his unwed mother, who had him in her teens and works as a cleaning woman for the Sheridans. Ironically, Connell has been better nurtured by this wonderful woman, whose education was derailed by his birth.
Marianne and Connell fall into an intense, complicated relationship that's repeatedly muddled by secrecy, miscommunications, and anxiety about their place in the social hierarchy. Rooney's novel tracks them closely over four years, between 2011 and 2015. In high school, Connell worries about eroding his social standing if his association with unpopular Marianne becomes known. At Trinity College Dublin, both Marianne and Connell are considered ""culchies"" — hicks — but her social star rises, while he attains ""the status of rich-adjacent"" only through his connection with her.
'Normal People' is a compulsive, psychologically astute will-they-or-won't-they love story involving two of the most sympathetic people you're liable to meet between covers
Normal People shares many similarities with Conversations with Friends , which is narrated by a young woman whose initiation into adulthood involves a troubled adulterous affair that impinges on her closest friendship and is further exacerbated by a painful physical condition (endometriosis). She feels — like Marianne and Connell in Normal People -- that she deserves to suffer. But in her second novel, Rooney demonstrates that she is gender blind when it comes to insecurities. Normal People's third person narrative, which alternates convincingly between Marianne's and Connell's points of view, wryly underscores the gap between their perspectives, even at the best of times.
The novel also deftly yo-yos between periods of deep communion (with beautifully wrought sex) followed by painful misunderstandings that compound her characters' insecurities. ""I don't know why I can't be like normal people ... I don't know why I can't make people love me,"" Marianne says, well into their on-again-off-again relationship, after confessing that she never told Connell about her miserable home life because she was afraid he would think she was ""damaged or something."" Quickly switching perspectives, Rooney writes, ""But he always thought she was damaged, he thought it anyway. He screws his eyes shut with guilt.""
Related NPR Stories Book Reviews Personal Demons And Class Differences Complicate Love In 'Normal People' What Does It Mean To Be A Normal Person? Among Rooney's abiding concerns are the fluctuating power dynamics in relationships. Issues of class, privilege, passivity, submission, emotional and physical pain, kindness, and depression all come into play. Her focus is on young adults as they struggle to navigate the minefields of intimacy against the backdrop of an economically uncertain, post-recession world threatened by climate change, political upheaval, and questions about the morality and viability of capitalism. Rooney's characters may be academically gifted, but they aren't sure how they want to live or what they want to do with their lives. In response to emotional injury, they sometimes seek physical pain. When overwhelmed, they detach. A crippling sense of unworthiness chafes against feelings of intellectual superiority.
Rooney's dialogue, like her descriptive prose, is slyly ironic, alternately evasive and direct, but always articulate. It cuts to the heart. She seems remarkably comfortable writing about sex — even uncomfortable sex — and she seamlessly integrates well-crafted texts, emails, and Facebook posts into her narratives like the digital native she is. Yet while Rooney may write about apparent aimlessness and all the distractions of our age, her novels are laser-focused and word-perfect. They build power by a steady accretion of often simple declarative sentences that track minuscule shifts in feelings.
At one point, Connell reflects on the serendipity of his connection with Marianne: ""At times he has the sensation that he and Marianne are like figure-skaters, improvising their discussions so adeptly and in such perfect synchronisation that it surprises them both. She tosses herself gracefully into the air, and each time, without knowing how he's going to do it, he catches her.""
It's a lovely image that also captures the graceful feat that Rooney pulls off in this novel. Although frequently heartbreaking, Normal People isn't bleak. The brave determination of Rooney's characters to reach out and try to catch each other with no guarantee of success — and to open themselves to ""moments of joy despite everything"" — is ultimately hopeful."

It's springtime again in Washington, D.C., when flowers bloom, birds chirp, and thousands of wonks from all over the world descend on the Spring Meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, Planet Money included. Since World War II, the IMF and World Bank have served as guardians of global capitalism. The IMF, in particular, has a long history of bailing out countries in financial crises and using its power to push a free-market agenda. That's why we were surprised to hear IMF officials suggest capitalism is running amok.
We heard it at the wonkiest part of this wonkfest, the IMF's ""analytical corner."" Throughout the week, IMF economists presented research on a small stage with a giant projector screen and big block letters that spelled ""IMF"" behind them. It looked sort of like a TED Talk, but the speakers weren't wearing those cheesy Backstreet Boy headset microphones.
Wenjie Chen, an economist in the IMF's Research Department, presented the findings of an impressive study that can be found in Chapter 2 of the IMF's World Economic Outlook . Chen gave us the sense that something fundamental in the economy has changed and that capitalism may be going haywire. The reason: companies are getting too powerful.
Why pay more? Chen began her talk with a personal story. In 2016, Chen's six-month-old daughter, Lily, suffered a severe allergic reaction from eating dairy. Lily is okay now, but Chen and her spouse now carry EpiPens in case Lily has another attack. The first time Chen bought the epinephrine device, she was outraged by the cost: more than $600 for a two pack. As has been widely reported , the company had raised their price by 500% since 2009.
Enlarge this image Wenjie Chen speaks at the IMF's ""analytical corner"" during the Spring Meetings. Greg Rosalsky/NPR Greg Rosalsky/NPR Wenjie Chen speaks at the IMF's ""analytical corner"" during the Spring Meetings.
Greg Rosalsky/NPR The EpiPen pricing tale provides an extreme example of what economists call a ""price markup,"" which is when a company charges a price for something that is higher than the cost of producing it. In the fairytale version of capitalism, competition takes away the power of companies to mark up their prices and forces them to sell their products at the price it costs to make them. When companies can markup their prices over this competitive level, economists say they possess ""market power.""
Fairytale Fact Check Chen and colleagues recently studied the price markups of a jaw-dropping number of companies — almost one million! — across 27 countries. They found that market power is growing, especially in advanced countries, where companies increased their markups by an average of 8% between 2000 and 2015. This increase in market power has occurred in a wide range of industries, from tech to pharmaceuticals to energy to finance.
""What is really remarkable here is that we find it's a small fraction of firms within each industry that's really driving this increase in market power,"" Chen said. These top-tier firms increased their markups by over 30% over the last couple decades.
This is about more than just consumers having to pay more at the store. The IMF's economists connect rising market power to a range of worrisome trends in the overall economy: lackluster business investment, sluggish productivity growth, declining innovation and increasing inequality. They estimate that if price markups had remained at their 2000 levels, GDP in the average advanced country would be about one percent higher. ""If market power is not kept in check, these negative impacts might actually worsen,"" Chen warns.
Leading Firms Are Running Away From The Pack As for why we're seeing a rising tide of market power, the IMF doesn't have solid answers. The fact that it's occurring in virtually every industry across the developed world suggests it may be broad technological changes that reward winning. One driver may be ""network effects,"" which makes a service get even better as more people use it, and thus, harder to compete against it. An example is Google. With billions of searches a day, each one making the next work a little better, Google's self-reinforcing popularity has become like a moat filled with sharks for competitors.
There's nothing inherently wrong with a product being provided by a bigger company. If that's the most efficient way it's done, economists usually don't pass judgment. But the IMF says increased concentration is having nasty side effects that are slowing growth. When companies build stable pipelines of profits and don't have to worry about competition, they don't have to invest and innovate as much. Others warn economic power leads to political power, which can lead to another kind of moat that blocks competition.
OK, IMF, Are You Gonna Fix It? The IMF's recommendations are a far cry from saying we need to start breaking up companies. Instead, they say countries should ensure ""a level playing field,"" and they offer some some pretty modest ways to do that, including cutting red tape on startups, opening up trade restrictions, and potentially loosening intellectual property and patent laws. (A growing chorus of American wonks have been calling for more aggressive antitrust enforcement. Give a listen to our recent three-part antitrust series on this for all the gory details).
The story about EpiPens has a (somewhat) happy ending. Following public outcry, congressional hearings and lots of news coverage, generic versions of the device hit the market. In 2017, CVS began selling a generic version of the EpiPen that costs about one-sixth the cost Chen had to pay for hers in 2016. It's an example of competition doing what it's supposed to do. Now we just need to somehow make that happen like a gazillion more times.

"How Notre Dame, 'Vast Symphony In Stone,' Weaves Its Way Through Parisian History",www.npr.org,Andrew Lapin,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/16/713822050/how-notre-dame-vast-symphony-in-stone-weaves-its-way-through-parisian-history," cathedral Notre Dame de Paris, seen in 2013, is over 850 years old. The foundation stone was laid in 1163 by Pope Alexander III. John van Hasselt/Corbis via Getty Images John van Hasselt/Corbis via Getty Images The cathedral Notre Dame de Paris, seen in 2013, is over 850 years old. The foundation stone was laid in 1163 by Pope Alexander III.
John van Hasselt/Corbis via Getty Images The center of Paris is Notre Dame.
This is true both literally and figuratively. The Gothic cathedral is there on Île de la Cité, the island in the Seine in between Paris' Left and Right banks, convenient and inescapable for the estimated 13 million people who visit it every year. Just outside, a Point Zero marker measures the distance to everything else in France. And Notre Dame is there in more than 850 years of French history: in paintings, daguerreotypes, songs, novels, war photos, awed selfies.
On April 15, Notre Dame de Paris caught fire , and its interior was almost entirely destroyed. The wooden roof burned clean through, and the proud spire – actually added between 1845 and 1879 – toppled over like a child's toy set. Outside, thousands of horrified onlookers held up their phones. Some began to sing hymns.

Hubert Hitier/AFP/Getty Images It took a heroic effort by more than 500 firefighters merely to contain the spread, rescue a few of the many artworks inside, and preserve the structure and the cathedral's two towers. But from a cultural perspective, the damage has already been catastrophic. The aerial shots showed the halls of the church, completed in 1345, lit up in a blazing cross. Stained-glass windows, some of them dating back to the building's original construction, were destroyed.
How did it feel to watch this in Paris from behind a police barrier as the flames roared overhead? In 1831, author Victor Hugo published his beloved novel Notre Dame de Paris , known in English as The Hunchback of Notre Dame , in which he describes the cathedral as ""a vast symphony in stone.""

Online, Americans shared their remembrances of visiting the cathedral and climbing the towers. Practicing Catholics, members of non-Christian faiths and nonreligious people all recalled being overcome by a sense of spiritual awe when they stepped inside the structure and returning years later to light candles for loved ones. They talked to Notre Dame staff, who said their favorite part of the job was watching the light change over Paris from the tops of the towers.
One visitor recalled how her then-boyfriend refused to enter the building, afraid the metal detectors would set off the engagement ring he was concealing in his pocket. Another couple did enter and licked the inside of the building (""a tiny, non-damaging lick to cement our bond."")

Remy De La Mauviniere/AP Seeing Notre Dame and its rooftop gargoyles overlooking so many visual representations of Paris over the years, ""you get the sense of the cathedral as this place that is solid and immovable, and kind of watching history unfold underneath it,"" said Catherine Clark, an associate professor of French studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Construction on Notre Dame began in the 12th century to replace a smaller cathedral, on orders from King Louis VII and a series of bishops culminating in Maurice de Sully. Over more than a century, it morphed from a traditional Romanesque architectural style to an innovative Gothic design. Its use of high buttresses and many stained-glass windows allowed more light into the hall than in previous church designs.

Pierre Suu/Getty Images A position right by the city's only hospital at the time, L'Hôtel-Dieu, ensured the church's creation would become an essential element of Paris life, Clark said.
No one had ever seen anything like Notre Dame before, and the grand acoustics of its ribbed interior led to musical pieces, like the 13th-century repertory Magnus Liber Organi , written specifically to be performed inside the cathedral.
""The acoustics of that specific space are, in a pretty literal way, baked into the DNA of classical music,"" said Sophie Benn, a musicologist at Case Western Reserve University.

Georges Gobet/AFP/Getty Images Georges Gobet/AFP/Getty Images Statues that had sat around the spire of Notre Dame were spared because they had already been removed restoration company's Socra workshop.
Georges Gobet/AFP/Getty Images Notre Dame has a conflicted role in French history, as a symbol of both national character and religious significance. The association with Catholicism became a liability during the French Revolution in 1789, as hordes of secularists stormed the structure, pillaging artwork and claiming the cathedral for the atheistic Cult of Reason. And in keeping with the royalty purge of the time, they beheaded every statue of a king inside.
But Notre Dame persisted. Only a few decades later, with the landmark having fallen into neglect and disrepair, it gained a crucial celebrity advocate in Victor Hugo. The author believed strongly in the value of architectural preservation, and wrote Notre Dame de Paris as a restoration campaign.

Thomas Samson/AFP/Getty Images Hugo's wistful, achingly human tragedy of the hunchback named Quasimodo who both lives in and stands for the cathedral itself, ringing its iconic bells and offering sanctuary to a beautiful gypsy named Esmeralda helped spur on public support for the building that led to a major renovation in the 19th century. The gargoyles and the spire were added; the beheaded kings were re-headed.
The novel remains a gateway into the majesty of Notre Dame today.
""I was so fascinated by this idea of Notre Dame de Paris as a kind of Quasimodo itself, an amalgamation of different types of architectural styles accumulated over the centuries and centered by this bright, cyclops eye that was its rose window,"" said Leigh Giangreco, a reporter at The Capitol Forum who studied in Paris in 2012 and recalled reading Hugo's book while viewing the cathedral across the Seine at the Shakespeare & Company bookstore.

Eric Feferberg/AFP/Getty Images ""All I can think of today, watching Notre Dame burn, is the end of Hugo's epic novel,"" Giangreco said. ""After Esmeralda and Frollo die, [Quasimodo] sobs deeply, 'Oh! All that I have ever loved!' ""
The cathedral's role as an onlooker of history continued into the German occupation of France during World War II. In 1944, when the French mounted an uprising against the Nazis, the area in front of Notre Dame became a key location of the fighting, as resistors built barriers and hurled Molotov cocktails at German troops on Île de la Cité. And after victory, American soldiers were present for the ringing of the bells at the cathedral, signifying that France was now free. The French troops hosted a feast of thanksgiving at the cathedral, where some of the final shots of the war were fired, as Nazi snipers took final, desperate aim at the rejoicing crowds.

Philippe Lopez/AFP/Getty Images ""A lot of the photos of the liberation of Paris have Notre Dame in the background,"" Clark said. ""It's this kind of backdrop for this moment of national liberation.""
Notre Dame was not the first cultural institution to see such sudden mass destruction this century, and it won't be the last. In September 2018, the Museu Nacional in Rio de Janeiro was gutted by a blaze that destroyed the building and millions of historical artifacts in a matter of hours. And since 2014, the Islamic State has methodically destroyed dozens of historic mosques, libraries and heritage sites across Syria and Iraq. Physical structures may feel like safe, permanent homes for humanity's history, but they are also fragile, vulnerable to human error and malice alike.

And Notre Dame's legions of admirers the world over, particularly Americans, stand ready to aid in a reconstruction. An American nonprofit, Friends of Notre Dame de Paris, was formed in 2017 to raise funds for the current restoration project at the cathedral. Other groups have already begun fundraising campaigns .

Colorado's Oil And Gas Regulators Must Now Consider Public Health And Safety,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/16/712877704/colorados-oil-and-gas-regulators-must-now-consider-public-health-and-safety,"Enlarge this image A drilling rig at work near a residential neighborhood in Erie, Colo. An overhaul of oil and gas regulations will give localities more control over where drilling can happen. Grace Hood/CPR Grace Hood/CPR A drilling rig at work near a residential neighborhood in Erie, Colo. An overhaul of oil and gas regulations will give localities more control over where drilling can happen.
Grace Hood/CPR After years of tension over expanded oil and gas drilling, including a deadly explosion that galvanized critics, Colorado is moving to tighten regulations on the booming industry. In a sweeping overhaul the governor is expected to sign, regulators will now have to consider public health, safety and the environment in decisions about permitting and local land use.
The state must still hammer out the details of how to implement the new law over the next year. But the impending changes are already fueling hope for some, and fear for others.
""Oil and gas leaves, we're gone""
""We just had our largest order from an oil and gas worker,"" says Matt Smith, owner of Daddy's Goodness BBQ outside Greeley, as the lunch-hour rush crowded around the window of his bright red food truck.
Smith changed careers to start the business two years ago. ""Oil and gas leaves, we're gone,"" he says.
Greeley is the epicenter of Colorado's oil and gas development. Weld County is where 90 percent of Colorado's oil is pumped, and the region hosts oil companies, secondary companies that truck water and supplies to well pads, and companies like Smith's that depend on business from the oil fields. Many who live in Greeley oppose the changes.

Grace Hood/CPR Grace Hood/CPR Matt Smith started Daddy's Goodness BBQ in Weld County two years ago. He worries new oil and gas regulations will slow down production and hurt his business.
Grace Hood/CPR ""There's a lot of anger, but I think beneath that anger is a lot of fear,"" says Barbara Kirkmeyer, Weld County commissioner. ""A lot of people are scared of what can happen here.""
The new law would give cities and counties more control over where oil wells go. It would also shift the state's mandate from fostering oil and gas development to regulating it, with a focus on the environment and people's safety. The Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission will get new members with environmental and public health expertise.
The legislation also launches rule-makings in half a dozen areas, including flow lines, and limiting potent methane leaks from oil and gas infrastructure.
Weld County officials worry those new rules could slow the approval of new drilling permits — already backlogged — and curtail a crucial cash flow. In 2018, oil and gas production contributed $490 million in tax revenue, about 60 percent of the county's overall tax dollars.
Environment Microplastic Found Even In The Air In France's Pyrenees Mountains Jeff Robbins, director of the state's Oil and Gas Conservation Commission, says it will continue to process permits even as it implements the new rules.
Still, companies could see new hurdles, including rising costs for permit applications.
More local control over where drilling can happen
Perhaps the biggest shift will be giving local communities more control in regulating oil and gas development. South of Greeley, residents of Erie, Colo., have been pushing for that as they've watched multiple drilling projects come through their neighborhoods.
""The first time when they were close to us and drilling, you could actually feel the vibration in our house,"" says Robin Goldsmith, as she loads her aging terrier into her SUV.
That first well pad was about 1,000 feet away. That's more than double the distance from homes that the state requires, so there wasn't much she could do to stop it.
""Hopefully [the new law] will make a difference, because in this particular area — in Erie, in Broomfield — there is a ton of activity going on,"" she says.
The push for more restrictions gained traction two years ago. That's when two people died after a home explosion not far away from Erie, in Firestone. An underground line from a well had leaked gas.
Goldsmith does not share concerns that the new law will prompt an economic slowdown for the industry. ""That's the oil and gas companies making sure that their investments are protected, as opposed to the good of the people,"" she says.

Grace Hood/CPR Legal pressures and what comes next
Ultimately it will be up to towns, cities and counties to decide if they want to tackle new rules on oil and gas development. In Erie, town trustee Christiaan van Woudenberg ran for office on a platform against fracking and plans to start the process soon. But he says it will be tricky.
He worries about a last-minute change to the legislation favored by industry. It restricts communities to doing only what's ""necessary and reasonable"" to protect health and safety.
""So lawyers will decide what that means,"" van Woudenberg says. ""And the problem is that these oil and gas companies have access to resources magnitudes of orders beyond a town council like Erie.""
Some worry that imbalance could prevent communities from tackling rule-making altogether. Anne Lee Foster, of the environmental group Colorado Rising, says local officials may be deterred ""for fear of being litigated and not having the resources to properly defend their communities.""
Last fall, Colorado Rising supported a ballot measure that would have imposed a 2,500-foot distance between oil wells and homes, but it failed to pass.
The group says it will watch closely to see how the new law plays out. If community controls are stymied by industry in the courts, Foster says, Colorado Rising will float a statewide ballot issue in 2020, trying yet again to get even more local control.
But first, opponents of the latest restrictions on oil and gas development may have their shot at a redo. They're already campaigning for a ballot measure to repeal the law."

Twitter For more than 30 years, the Inuit welcomed anthropologist Jean Briggs into their lives so she could study how they raise their children. Briggs is pictured during a 1974 visit to Baffin Island. Jean Briggs Collection / American Philosophical Society hide caption
toggle caption Jean Briggs Collection / American Philosophical Society Back in the 1960s, a Harvard graduate student made a landmark discovery about the nature of human anger.
At age 34, Jean Briggs traveled above the Arctic Circle and lived out on the tundra for 17 months. There were no roads, no heating systems, no grocery stores. Winter temperatures could easily dip below minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit.
Briggs persuaded an Inuit family to ""adopt"" her and ""try to keep her alive,"" as the anthropologist wrote in 1970.
This story is part of a series from NPR's Science desk called The Other Side of Anger. There's no question we are in angry times. It's in our politics, our schools and homes. Anger can be a destructive emotion, but it can also be a positive force.
Join NPR in our exploration of anger and what we can learn from this powerful emotion. Read and listen to stories in the series here.
At the time, many Inuit families lived similar to the way their ancestors had for thousands of years. They built igloos in the winter and tents in the summer. ""And we ate only what the animals provided, such as fish, seal and caribou,"" says Myna Ishulutak , a film producer and language teacher who lived a similar lifestyle as a young girl.
Briggs quickly realized something remarkable was going on in these families: The adults had an extraordinary ability to control their anger.
""They never acted in anger toward me, although they were angry with me an awful lot,"" Briggs told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. in an interview.
Myna Ishulutak (upper right, in blue jacket) lived a seminomadic life as a child. Above: photos of the girl and her family in the hunting camp of Qipisa during the summer of 1974. Jean Briggs Collection / American Philosophical Society hide caption
toggle caption Jean Briggs Collection / American Philosophical Society Even just showing a smidgen of frustration or irritation was considered weak and childlike, Briggs observed.
For instance, one time someone knocked a boiling pot of tea across the igloo, damaging the ice floor. No one changed their expression. ""Too bad,"" the offender said calmly and went to refill the teapot.
In another instance, a fishing line — which had taken days to braid — immediately broke on the first use. No one flinched in anger. ""Sew it together,"" someone said quietly.
By contrast, Briggs seemed like a wild child, even though she was trying very hard to control her anger. ""My ways were so much cruder, less considerate and more impulsive,"" she told the CBC. ""[I was] often impulsive in an antisocial sort of way. I would sulk or I would snap or I would do something that they never did.""
Briggs, who died in 2016, wrote up her observations in her first book , Never in Anger . But she was left with a lingering question: How do Inuit parents instill this ability in their children? How do Inuit take tantrum-prone toddlers and turn them into cool-headed adults?
Then in 1971, Briggs found a clue.

In her new song and video called ""Home To You,"" Welsh singer Cate Le Bon uses a luminous wash of avant-pop to explore one community's search for belonging and a sense of place.
Alongside British director Phil Collins, Le Bon explores the Lunik IX neighborhood in the Slovakian city of Košice. The community is home to a large group of Romani people who, at the hands of multigenerational antiziganism, often live in slums and dilapidated estates, lacking access to housing, employment and basic services like electricity and water. Filmed in a variety of locations, including a bustling flea market and the halls of a music conservatory, Collins splendidly captures moments of shared humanity that echo far beyond Košice's boundaries.
In a statement to NPR about the piece, Collins says, ""In an age of discord, in which the politics of division and xenophobia — from Brexit to Trump — tears communities apart across nations and continents, it is crucial to stand in solidarity everywhere with those subjected to routine discrimination and a denied sense of belonging.""
The track is filled with buoyant optimism, balancing sweeping string arrangements and playful xylophone with Le Bon's soaring refrains. For Collins and Le Bon, home isn't a place, it's the warmth of a glance between friends and the beauty of a reciprocated smile — the sublime power of individuals lifting each other into togetherness.

Jin Lee/Bloomberg via Getty Images Obesity. Diabetes. By now, we've all heard of the health risks posed by drinking too much soda.
But over in Appalachia, the region that stretches roughly from southern New York state to Alabama, the fight against soda is targeting an altogether different concern: rotted teeth.
Public health advocates say soft drinks are driving the region's alarmingly high incidence of eroded brown teeth — a phenomenon dubbed ""Mountain Dew mouth,"" after the region's favorite drink. They want to tackle the problem with policies, including restricting soda purchases with food stamps (now called the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, and currently under debate in Congress).
""We are using taxpayer dollars to buy soda for the SNAP program, and we are using taxpayer dollars to rip teeth out of people's heads who can't afford dental care and are on Medicaid,"" says Dana Singer, a research analyst at the Mid-Ohio Valley Health Department in Parkersburg, W.Va., who wants to see stricter regulations on sales of all sugary beverages in the region. ""It makes no sense to be paying for these things twice.""
The beverage industry has repeatedly challenged claims that its products are destroying teeth. But dentists beg to differ.
""I see erosion from the acids in the drinks, and decay from the sugars,"" says Steven Ghareeb , spokesman for the Academy of General Dentistry and a practicing dentist in South Charleston, W.Va. ""They go hand in hand many times, and they're equally bad. I would definitely attribute these problems to drinks."" Both sodas and energy drinks, he says, ""are more damaging than food.""
The Salt 'Soda Mouth' Can Look A Lot Like 'Meth Mouth' Dentists have also found that the effects of soda on teeth are strikingly similar to the effects of methamphetamine or crack on teeth, as I reported in May. Drinking more than a soda a day raises the risk that acids found in many soft and energy drinks will eat away at your tooth enamel and its pearly white color. To get a sense of what that looks like, check out this picture .
Back in 2009, Priscilla Harris, an associate professor at the Appalachian College of Law, issued the first battle cry in the war against Mountain Dew mouth with a legal brief titled "" Undoing the Damage of the Dew ,"" which explores how the drink became ingrained in the region's culture. Since then, she's been leading the charge to come up with policies to tackle the problem.
Harris says that dental problems are especially bad because dental care is harder to get in Appalachia, which includes many of the poorest and most remote communities in the country. Many people don't trust the well water in their homes because of pollution concerns and probably drink more soda because of it, she says. She's received a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation to study the problem.
And there's another reason why soda mouth is so pervasive in Appalachia, Harris says: the region's distinct culture of sipping soda constantly throughout the day. Singer adds, ""Here in West Virginia, you see people carrying around bottles of Mountain Dew all the time — even at a public health conference.""
The drink is also native to the region. Mountain Dew was invented in Tennessee , before PepsiCo bought the brand.
""What Mountain Dew has going for it is that it's high in caffeine and high in sugar,"" Harris says, adding, ""Students tell us it tastes best, and it's a habit.""
While Harris says that there aren't a lot of comprehensive surveys of dental health in Appalachia, signs of a rampant problem are unmistakable: Some 26 percent of preschoolers in the region have tooth decay, and 15 percent of 18- to 24-year-olds have had a tooth extracted because of decay or erosion. That's according to calculations by Singer, who is working with Harris.
The elderly are affected, too. Some 67 percent of West Virginians age 65 or older have lost six or more teeth owing to tooth decay or gum disease, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Singer says one of the best opportunities to curb the problem is targeting programs like SNAP, which allows recipients to buy soda. According to a 2012 study by Yale's Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity, the federal government is spending $1.7 billion to $2.1 billion on soda purchases through SNAP.
Under current guidelines, any kind of soda of any size can be purchased with a SNAP card — even Mountain Dew, which has 170 calories in a single 12-ounce can.
Various states, from Florida to Tennessee, have proposed bills that would restrict the use of SNAP to buy soda, sugary treats or other unhealthful foods. Singer says she would like to see West Virginia and other states in Appalachia try this approach.
Basic education, says Harris, is also needed: ""We also just need to let people know that you can drink these drinks safely, but they can also do harm.""

National Security Robert Mueller's Russia Report Is Coming Thursday. Here's What You Need To Know The move is the latest sign that Democrats will continue to seek information on potential criminal activity by Trump and his business associates well after the expected release Thursday of the redacted report by special counsel Robert Mueller about Russian interference in the 2016 election.
The subpoenas were issued as part of a joint investigation led by the House Financial Services and intelligence committees into foreign influence on the U.S. political process.
Financial Services Committee Chair Maxine Waters, D-Calif., says the use of the financial system for potentially illicit purposes is a serious matter and the investigation is necessary under the committee's oversight authority.
Waters said the committee plans to investigate ""as thoroughly as possible pursuant to its oversight authority and will follow the facts wherever they may lead us.""
Politics Democrats Want To Probe Trump Ties To Deutsche Bank. GOP Says, No Thanks Several institutions were issued subpoenas, but intelligence committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., specifically noted Deutsche Bank's ""continued cooperation and compliance,"" calling theirs a ""friendly subpoena.""
Democrats have been particularly interested in Deutsche Bank and its relationship with the Trump campaign for several years. Waters asked Republicans to open an investigation into Trump's financial ties and potential money laundering at Deutsche Bank back in 2017 but Republicans, who had a majority in the House at the time, refused.
The subpoenas are part of a broader effort by Democrats to establish new information about Trump's financial dealings. A separate probe is underway in the House Ways and Means Committee, where Democrats are demanding that the Treasury Department turn over 10 years of Trump's tax returns .
Politics Treasury Department Misses House Committee Deadline To Turn Over Trump Tax Returns Treasury lawyers have so far refused to comply and many in Trump's inner circle have publicly questioned the legitimacy of that request.

A New Jersey woman pleaded guilty Monday to theft by deception for perpetrating what began as a story of redemption that was revealed to be a ruse.
Katelyn McClure appeared in New Jersey Superior Court, admitting to her role in duping thousands of people out of $400,000 through a fictionalized GoFundMe page purporting to benefit a homeless veteran said to have bought her gas.
McClure, 29, will serve a four-year-term in a New Jersey state prison under the plea, according to the Burlington County Prosecutor's Office . Sentencing is set for June 3. New Jersey Couple's GoFundMe Campaign To Help Homeless Man 'Was Predicated On A Lie'
In March , McClure pleaded guilty in federal court to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, which carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine. Federal sentencing is scheduled for June 19.
The homeless man, Johnny Bobbitt, 36, also pleaded guilty in both federal and state courts to charges related to the hoax. He has been admitted into a state drug treatment program , which could help him avoid some prison time. He has not been sentenced at the federal level. Lawyer For Homeless Man Says $400,000 Raised To Help Him Is Gone
""However,"" the Burlington County Prosecutor's Office said in a statement, ""if Bobbitt fails to adhere to the tightly-structured regimen of treatment and recovery services, which includes frequent testing for drug use, he could be sentenced to five years in state prison.""
A third person, Mark D'Amico, McClure's then-boyfriend, is also charged with theft by deception. His case is set to be presented next month to a Burlington County grand jury for possible indictment.
McClure's lawyer has said D'Amico was the driving force behind the scheme, and prosecutors say that McClure and Bobbitt have agreed to testify against him.
In November 2017, McClure and D'Amico created a GoFundMe Page titled ""Paying It Forward."" It said that McClure was driving home from Philadelphia on Interstate 95 when she ran out of gas and that Bobbitt, a homeless veteran, came to her rescue, spending his last $20 to buy her gas. With a photo of the duo standing by the road, the page solicited donations to help get Bobbitt off the street, with the goal of raising $10,000.
The money came pouring in after the media picked up on the story. Fourteen thousand people donated $400,000 in less than three weeks, according to prosecutors, none the wiser to the fact that McClure had never run out of gas and Bobbitt never spent $20 to help her."

Amazon Independent Booksellers ""Sometime in the last few years,"" American Psycho author Bret Easton Ellis writes in White , his aggrieved new book about political correctness, he began feeling a near-constant sense of ""disgust and frustration that was all due to the foolishness of other people.""
Ellis's log of personal slights include the following: because of his provocations on Twitter, he was disinvited from a GLAAD gala. The movie adaptation of his novel Less Than Zero had ""way too much smiling,"" which detracted from the gritty realness of the original (and, by extension, illustrated the bland and neutered quality of modern art and culture). Molly Ringwald was offended when he asked her questions about sex on his podcast. People don't get his jokes. He is pilloried on Twitter. His boyfriend is a whiny millennial socialist. And a series of expensive dinners were ruined by his companions' insistence on complaining about Donald Trump.
Most of us carry around an invisible rosary of resentments to fiddle with in petty moments; most of us also know to keep these grudges private. So there is a kind of magnificent solipsism involved in printing them in a book and insisting they explain the decline of American culture.
Once fairly liberal, Ellis believes that social media and the sanctification of victimhood have in the last few years transformed liberals, en masse, into fascists, children and, occasionally, fascist children. The left is now the domain of the ""overly sincere, the virtue signaler, the dumb-a--, the literal-minded, the humorless."" He considers extreme liberal rhetoric inflammatory and hysterical: comparisons of Trump to Hitler are ""repugnant,"" he writes.
That seems fair enough — but does he think his constant invocations of fascists and fascism are somehow different? These moments of hypocrisy occur so frequently that the reader begins to suspect Ellis simply has a different set of standards for himself than for anyone else. He has thoughts and opinions; everyone else has biases and agendas. His trolling is fun; anyone else's is a sign of cultural decline. When he is criticized it represents the degenerative power of social media. When opponents don't like his criticism, it is because they are crybabies.
You get the sense that Ellis expects, even wants, to be attacked for this book. It will confirm his view that, as a white man, he is unwelcome in American culture: ""these social media critics wanted to imply my whiteness was an ideological error, that my comfortable unawareness was an indisputable problem, yet I'd argue that living without a direct experience of poverty or state-sponsored violence, growing up without ever being presumed a guaranteed threat in public places and never facing an existence where protection is hard to come by don't equate to a lack of empathy, judgment, or understanding on my part and don't rightly and automatically demand my silence.""
That's all true enough. But it seems Ellis thinks his book will be pilloried because he is white and privileged; I suspect it is his simple cruelty that will do the trick. Take his claim, for instance, that Tyler Clementi, the Rutgers student who killed himself after his roommate recorded him kissing another man, was overly sensitive, the victim of a ""harmless freshman dorm-room prank."" Or his dark hints that women volunteer for their own subjugation: ""[Charlie] Sheen's supposed propensity for violence against women hadn't hurt his popularity with female fans either, and if anyone wants to know what that means, then that's a story for maybe fifty other books."" Moments like these, along with the clumsy provocation of the title, show Ellis' hand.
In White , I had hoped to find a genuine consideration of the left's preoccupation with public shaming, the increasingly repetitive vocabulary of resistance and cancelation, privilege and problematization. It's eminently possible to do this seriously and well: Consider, for instance, Jon Ronson's journalistic treatment of public shaming, So You've Been Publicly Shamed , or the unexpected and perceptive essays of the critic Meghan Daum. The difference is that these writers approach their subjects sincerely and with curiosity. Ellis's work is rooted in personal grievance: He can't escape the backlash cycle long enough to figure out what he actually believes or cares about. All he knows is that you care far too much.
At one point, Ellis admits that he is engaging in the behavior — ad hominem attacks, claims of victimhood, etc. — he criticizes so vehemently on the left. But he suggests that this only proves his point about the decline of discourse. ""I couldn't help it,"" he writes. The culture made him do it. In the end, for a chance of winning an argument against imaginary foes, Ellis is willing to concede that he is no longer capable of thinking for himself.

The left is now the domain of the ""overly sincere, the virtue signaler, the dumb-a--, the literal-minded, the humorless."" He considers extreme liberal rhetoric inflammatory and hysterical: comparisons of Trump to Hitler are ""repugnant,"" he writes.
That seems fair enough — but does he think his constant invocations of fascists and fascism are somehow different? These moments of hypocrisy occur so frequently that the reader begins to suspect Ellis simply has a different set of standards for himself than for anyone else. He has thoughts and opinions; everyone else has biases and agendas. His trolling is fun; anyone else's is a sign of cultural decline. When he is criticized it represents the degenerative power of social media. When opponents don't like his criticism, it is because they are crybabies.
You get the sense that Ellis expects, even wants, to be attacked for this book. It will confirm his view that, as a white man, he is unwelcome in American culture: ""these social media critics wanted to imply my whiteness was an ideological error, that my comfortable unawareness was an indisputable problem, yet I'd argue that living without a direct experience of poverty or state-sponsored violence, growing up without ever being presumed a guaranteed threat in public places and never facing an existence where protection is hard to come by don't equate to a lack of empathy, judgment, or understanding on my part and don't rightly and automatically demand my silence.""
It's true his advantages don't preempt empathy. But he also doesn't seem to offer any. It seems Ellis thinks his book will be pilloried because he is white and privileged, but I suspect it is his simple cruelty that will do the trick. Take his claim, for instance, that Tyler Clementi, the Rutgers student who killed himself after his roommate recorded him kissing another man, was overly sensitive, the victim of a ""harmless freshman dorm-room prank."" Or his dark hints that women volunteer for their own subjugation: ""[Charlie] Sheen's supposed propensity for violence against women hadn't hurt his popularity with female fans either, and if anyone wants to know what that means, then that's a story for maybe fifty other books."" Moments like these, along with the clumsy provocation of the title, show Ellis' hand.
In White , I had hoped to find a genuine consideration of the left's preoccupation with public shaming, the increasingly repetitive vocabulary of resistance and cancelation, privilege and problematization. It's eminently possible to do this seriously and well: Consider, for instance, Jon Ronson's journalistic treatment of public shaming, So You've Been Publicly Shamed , or the unexpected and perceptive essays of the critic Meghan Daum. The difference is that these writers approach their subjects sincerely and with curiosity. Ellis's work is rooted in personal grievance: He can't escape the backlash cycle long enough to figure out what he actually believes or cares about. All he knows is that you care far too much.
At one point, Ellis admits that he is engaging in the behavior — ad hominem attacks, claims of victimhood, etc. — he criticizes so vehemently on the left. But he suggests that this only proves his point about the decline of discourse. ""I couldn't help it,"" he writes. The culture made him do it. In the end, for a chance of winning an argument against imaginary foes, Ellis is willing to concede that he is no longer capable of thinking for himself."

Molekuul/Getty Images/Science Photo Library The powerful gene-editing technique called CRISPR has been in the news a lot. And not all the news has been good: A Chinese scientist stunned the world last year when he announced he had used CRISPR to create genetically modified babies.
But scientists have long hoped CRISPR — a technology that allows scientists to make very precise modifications to DNA — could eventually help cure many diseases. And now scientists are taking tangible first steps to make that dream a reality.
For example, NPR has learned that a U.S. CRISPR study that had been approved for cancer at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia has finally started. A university spokesman on Monday confirmed for the first time that two patients had been treated using CRISPR.

toggle caption Erik Isakson/Getty Images/Tetra images RF A large new study finds mixed results for the effectiveness of programs aimed at motivating healthful behavior — such as more exercise and better nutrition — among employees.
Erik Isakson/Getty Images/Tetra images RF Workplace wellness programs — efforts to get workers to lose weight, eat better, stress less and sleep more — are an $8 billion industry in the U.S.
Most large employers offer some type of wellness program, with growth fueled by incentives in the federal Affordable Care Act.
But no one has been sure they work. Various studies over the years have provided conflicting results, with some showing savings and health improvements while others say the efforts fall short.
Many studies, however, faced a number of limitations, such as failing to have a comparison group, or figuring out whether people who sign up for such wellness programs are somehow healthier or more motivated than those who do not.
Shots - Health News As Insurers Offer Discounts For Fitness Trackers, Wearers Should Step With Caution Researchers from the University of Chicago and Harvard may have overcome some of these obstacles with one of the first large-scale studies to be peer-reviewed and employ a randomized controlled trial design. They published their findings Tuesday in the medical journal JAMA .
The scientists randomly assigned 20 BJ's Wholesale Club outlets to offer a wellness program to all employees, then compared results with 140 stores that did not.
The big-box retailer employed nearly 33,000 workers across all 160 clubs during the test.
The wellness program consisted of asking participating workers to fill out a health risk questionnaire, have some medical tests, such as blood pressure and blood glucose, and take up to eight classes on topics such as nutrition and exercise.
Shots - Health News Workplace Wellness Plans Offer Big Incentives, But May Cost Your Privacy After 18 months, it turned out that, yes, workers participating in the wellness programs self-reported healthier behavior than those not enrolled, such as exercising more or managing their weight better.
But the efforts did not result in differences in health measures, such as improved blood sugar or glucose levels, how much employers spent on health care or how often employees missed work. Their job performance and how long they stuck around in their jobs also seemed unaffected, the researchers say.
""The optimistic interpretation is there is no way we can get improvements in health or more efficient spending if we don't first have changes in health behavior,"" says Katherine Baicker, dean of the Harris School of Public Policy Chicago, and one of the study's authors. (Dr. Zirui Song, an assistant professor of health policy and medicine at Harvard Medical School, was its co-author.)
""But if employers are offering these programs in hopes that health spending and absenteeism will go down, this study should give them pause,"" Baicker says.
The study comes amid widespread interest in wellness programs.
Shots - Health News Athlete-Turned-Trucker Works To Improve Truckers' Health The Kaiser Family Foundation's annual survey of employers found that 53 percent of small firms and 82 percent of large firms offer a program in at least one of these areas: smoking cessation, weight management, and behavioral or lifestyle change. (Kaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the foundation.)
Some programs are simple, offering gift cards or other small incentives to fill out a health risk assessment; take a lunch-and-learn class; or join a gym or walking group. Others are far more invasive, asking employees to report on a variety of health-related questions and roll up their sleeves for blood tests.
A few employers offer financial incentives to workers who actually reduce their risk factors — lowering high blood pressure, for example, or reducing levels of bad cholesterol — or who make concerted efforts to participate in programs that might help them reduce these risk factors over time.
The Affordable Care Act allowed employers to offer financial incentives worth up to 30 percent of the cost of health insurance — that led some employers to entice workers with what could amount to hundreds or even thousands of dollars in discounted insurance premiums or reduced deductibles.
Such large financial incentives led to court challenges about whether those programs are truly voluntary. The result of such cases is still unclear — a judge has asked the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to revise the rules governing the programs, but those revisions are not expected to be published this year.
In the study reported in JAMA, the incentives were modest. Participants got small-dollar gift cards for taking wellness courses on topics such as nutrition, exercise, disease management and stress control. Total potential incentives averaged $250. About 35 percent of eligible employees at the 20 participating sites completed at least one module.
Results from those workers — including attendance and tenure data, their self-reported health assessment and results from lab blood tests — were specifically compared with similar reports from 20 primary comparison sites where workers were not offered the wellness gift cards and classes. Overall employment and health spending data from all worksites were included in the study.
Wellness program vendors say details matter when considering whether efforts will be successful.
Jim Pshock, founder and CEO of Bravo Wellness , says the incentives offered to BJ's workers might not have been large enough to spur the kinds of big changes needed to affect health outcomes.
Amounts ""of less than $400 generally incentivize things people were going to do anyway,"" Pshock says. ""It's simply too small to get them to do things they weren't already excited about.""
An accompanying editorial in JAMA notes that ""traditional, broad-based programs like the one analyzed by Song and Baicker may lack the necessary intensity, duration, and focus on particular employee segments to generate significant effects over a short time horizon.""
In other words, don't give up entirely on wellness efforts, but consider ""more targeted approaches"" that focus on specific workers who have higher risks, or on ""health behaviors [that] may yield larger health and economic benefits,"" the editorial suggests.
It could be, the study acknowledges, that 18 months isn't enough time to track such savings. So, Baicker and Song also plan to publish three-year results once they are finalized.
Still, similar findings were recently reported by the University of Illinois, where individuals were randomly selected to be offered wellness programs. This study, published in 2018 by the National Bureau of Economic Research , concluded that the workplace wellness program did not reduce health care costs or change health behaviors.
In one interesting point, that study found that wellness-program participants were likely already healthier and more motivated, ""thus a primary benefit of these programs to employers may be their potential to attract and retain healthy workers with low medical spending,"" the authors write.
Everyone involved in studying or conducting wellness agrees on one thing: Changing behavior, and getting people motivated to participate at all, can be difficult.
Steven Aldana, CEO of WellSteps , a wellness program vendor, says that for the efforts to be successful, they must cut across many areas — from the food served in company cafeterias to including spouses or significant others in helping people quit smoking, eat better or exercise more.
""Behavior is more complicated than simply taking a few wellness modules,"" Aldana said. ""It's a lifestyle matrix or pattern you have to adopt."""

"Paradise, Calif., Water Is Contaminated But Residents Are Moving Back Anyway",www.npr.org,Kirk Siegler,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/16/713430751/paradise-calif-water-is-contaminated-but-residents-are-moving-back-anyway,"Enlarge this image Pat Zinn's home survived the Camp Fire. She moved back in a few months ago despite warnings that the water supply could be contaminated. She says her goldfish survived the fire and are still thriving in the water coming through the taps. Kirk Siegler/NPR Kirk Siegler/NPR Pat Zinn's home survived the Camp Fire. She moved back in a few months ago despite warnings that the water supply could be contaminated. She says her goldfish survived the fire and are still thriving in the water coming through the taps.
Kirk Siegler/NPR Five months after the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in California history, the town of Paradise remains a disaster zone. Only 6 percent of the debris from last November's Camp Fire has been hauled away. Burned out skeletons of cars, piles of toxic rubble and blackened old-growth pine trees can still be seen everywhere.
Before the wildfire, the population of Paradise was about 26,000. Today, it's in the hundreds.
The extent of the latest crisis unfolding in Paradise is yet unknown: The deadly fire may also have contaminated up to 173 miles of pipeline in the town's water system with cancer-causing benzene and other volatile organic compounds, or VOCs. Preliminary results have shown contamination in about a third of the lines tested, though only about 2 percent of the entire system has been sampled.
Still, the water crisis is just the latest setback that has called into question whether the town was ready to reopen.
And some have had no choice but to move back.
""As soon as the house was cleaned, our insurance company told us that we had to come home,"" says Kyla Awalt.
Awalt's home off Bille Road is the only one still eerily standing in the rubble of what used to be her neighborhood. Her family had planned to move back, eventually. In January, though, they were notified that their ""additional living expenses"" had run out. But there was no potable water in town then, nor is there today.
They considered selling. But how do you put a home on the market if it doesn't have any water?
""You can't,"" Awalt says. ""That's part of the inspection process.""
So they bought a huge water tank, out of pocket, for $6,500. It's sitting beneath the shade of an old walnut tree along the fence line of her property. On the other side of the fence is the rubble of what used to be her neighbor's home. There are piles of debris and a couple of mangled, burnt lawn mowers waiting to be hauled away.
The Awalts spend $250 to fill the water tank every few weeks. It's expensive, but it's peace of mind.
""It's kind of up to the homeowner,"" Awalt says. ""It's on them to figure it out.""
Before the Camp Fire, Paradise was known as a bedroom community as well as an affordable haven for retirees. Much of the population tended to skew lower income, and the idea that they're now being left to fend for themselves is alarming to experts like Andrew Whelton.
""That's not protecting public health,"" says Whelton, a civil engineer who built his career advising the U.S. military on how to restore water infrastructure after disasters. ""That's not what we're supposed to be doing with a population that has gone under trauma like this; we're supposed to help them.""
National PG&E Says Its Equipment Likely Caused Camp Fire, As Investigation Continues National 'Reimagining Paradise' — Making Plans To Rebuild A Town Destroyed By Wildfire Whelton, now at Purdue University, has recently been consulting with the town's primary water supplier, the Paradise Irrigation District. The utility is trying to pinpoint the source of the contamination, whether it's from burnt plastic pipes and meters or from the toxic waste from burnt structures that was flushed into the town's water pipes. Much of the town's housing stock was older and didn't have back-flow protection.
""The scale of the recovery effort and the testing that's needed in my experience here will be unprecedented,"" Whelton says.
It's likely unprecedented, but it's also a warning to other cities in high risk wildfire zones.
The district's manager, Kevin Phillips, says his staff is overwhelmed.
""There is no playbook for a wildfire that destroys a town and you have a depressurization of a system that creates contamination,"" Phillips says.
There are 10,500 service lines in the district's system, which was built in the 1950s and already had a reputation of being outdated and haphazardly designed. Phillips says the plan is to prioritize testing in neighborhoods where homes are still standing and to shut down and isolate the contaminated places.
The system will take years to fix. The testing alone could take more than two years.
""We feel like we are under the microscope of the nation right now, that we are going to be the reason why the town doesn't rebuild. ... If there's no water, there's no town,"" Phillips says.
But Phillips says they won't do anything hastily that would jeopardize public health. As more people try to move back, the utility hopes to buy and deliver tanks with potable water — a program will hopefully begin later this month. But no one knows yet who will pay for that.
Whelton worries that means folks living here will continue to be exposed to yet unknown risks.

Kirk Siegler/NPR Kirk Siegler/NPR Paradise Irrigation District manager Kevin Phillips shows a sample of the town's water pipes, which were frequently woven between underground root systems that were likely burned during the fire.
Kirk Siegler/NPR ""In a disaster of this scale, that is one of the takeaways here,"" he says. ""In the absence of any credible authority providing help to a population, they will do what it takes to survive.""
For now, there are strict warnings that people moving back in should not drink or even boil the water, let alone use it for any household activity unless it has been tested. Whelton says some residents are buying water filtration systems that aren't proven to be safe enough to handle the high VOC readings, or they're relying on a single-point-in-time test for contaminants.
Seventy-nine-year-old Pat Zinn, whose home of four decades was spared, got her water tested three months ago. It showed the all clear.
""They did say it could change so I should have it retested, but it's $100 every time you have it tested, so I guess I'm gambling,"" Zinn says.
Zinn is drinking the free bottled water, but she's using tap water for most everything else.
""Something's going to get me one of these days anyway,"" Zinn says. ""So I'm not really that concerned about it.""
She chuckles as she tries to make light of the latest setback in front of her town's recovery. She's mostly concerned about Paradise's survival, which she says hinges on its water crisis being solved.
""That's the big thing,"" she says. ""If we don't have that taken care of the town is going to die."""

toggle caption John Moore/Getty Images Central American migrants stand at the U.S.-Mexico border fence in El Paso, Texas. The migrants turned themselves in to U.S. Border Patrol agents, seeking political asylum in the United States.
John Moore/Getty Images The language used to describe immigration is one of the most common topics of concern when we hear from NPR listeners and readers. That's no surprise, really, given the rapidly evolving nature of what is happening at the Southwest border and the way some words (""crisis"" and ""illegal"" come to mind) have been marshaled for political ends.
Advocates on both sides of the immigration issue want to paint the situation in stark terms for their own purposes. But, of course, that's not NPR's role. Its reporting should (and does) strive to present the information as factually and fairly as possible, so listeners and readers can make up their own minds about the issues discussed.
Apprehensions The word ""apprehensions"" (and its verb form, ""apprehended"") is one word sparking some recent debate.
When U.S. Customs and Border Protection releases its monthly reports about the number of migrants they are processing at the Southwest border, the official statistic is referred to as ""apprehensions and inadmissibles.""
NPR has used the term ""apprehended,"" rightly, going back many years, when talking about those arrested trying to enter the country illegally. Some readers and listeners have questioned whether it is the best word choice now that the nature of those ""apprehensions"" has so substantially changed in recent months.
Here's an explanation of what NPR is referring to when the word is used, and thoughts on some more precise language.
Webster's New World Fourth College Edition (NPR's dictionary of record) defines ""apprehend"" as ""to take into custody; capture or arrest."" That's what I think an average listener or reader would understand when reading that , say, ""The number of migrants apprehended at the border last month surpassed 103,000 — the highest level in more than a decade."" The ""capture"" part of the dictionary definition conjures up an element of someone trying to escape, to run away. But increasingly, that's not what's happening at the border. Nor does the 103,000-plus number actually reflect only ""apprehensions;"" it also includes what the government describes as ""inadmissibles"" (see below).
According to NPR's reporting team covering the issue, many migrants are crossing the border somewhere other than an official entry point and then presenting themselves, often in large family groups, to border agents and requesting asylum (though the percentage of the total requesting asylum is not included in the monthly report). Is it accurate, then, to describe these people as having been ""apprehended,"" a word that also implies attempting to evade the law?
Brian Lehrer, host of a talk program on WNYC, the NPR-affiliated public radio station in New York City, raised the issue last week in an interview with Washington Post immigration reporter Maria Sacchetti:
LEHRER: By the way, the technical term for being taken into custody at the border is ""apprehended."" That's what's on the official government sites. So when I did those stats and looked all the way back to 2000, that's what they call it: 'apprehensions at the border.' But is that even an accurate word for what's happening today? Aren't so many of these people coming to give themselves up so they can enter the asylum process?
SACCHETTI: Well they are... they are a majority — I mean, most them ... the bulk of them are families, parents and children or aunts and children, grandmothers and children. And they, they are surrendering in large groups — some as large as 300 people. And it's ... it's such a dramatic change. I mean, there are still single people adults sneaking in on their own and trying to avoid immigration authorities. But the border now is set up so well to detect them and to deport them that they're often apprehended also very quickly.
A much smaller number of migrants are presenting themselves at official points of entry and requesting asylum. Those migrants are included in the totals, but as ""inadmissibles."" For the month of March, the figures were 92,607 ""apprehensions"" and 10,885 ""inadmissibles."" The total is the 103,000-plus number.
I'm not sure that most listeners and readers would hear ""apprehended"" and realize what a vast range of actions that encompasses. While shorthand is always tempting to journalists trying to describe the big picture and get to the meat of policy questions, more precision in this case would help NPR's audience better understand the complicated border dynamics.
I like the way this Vox article referred to the broad number: as people who ""tried to enter the US without valid papers.""
As an alternative to ""apprehended"" or ""apprehensions"" alone — at least while the current trend of asylum-seekers turning themselves in to authorities persists — I like the way the digital version of this NPR story puts it, talking about people who were ""apprehended or surrendered."" Another good option would be to say these people had been ""taken into custody.""
Laura Smitherman, an NPR deputy national editor who has been overseeing the border coverage, suggested ""unauthorized border crossings."" And Mark Memmott, NPR's standards and practices editor, suggested that, ""maybe 'detained' is often best because if you are apprehended or you surrender you're going to be detained for at least a while.""
Meanwhile, Memmott last week issued this guidance to the newsroom, explaining more about what the U.S. Customs and Border Protection's data encompasses, and steering staff away from referring to them as ""arrests"":
There's an important footnote with U.S. Customs and Border Protection's data . It states that:
Most of the people CBP counts in its data are listed under the heading ""apprehensions.""
Don't simply say, then, that those who have crossed the southern border and been detained have been ""arrested."" Not everyone has been, or will be, charged with a crime. The best practice is to use ""apprehended"" or ""detained"" as the action words when reporting broadly about what is happening to people. Save ""arrested"" for those times when we drill down into the data.
About that data:
When reporting on the recent surge of migrants, many of whom are seeking asylum, there are two categories. As mentioned, the biggest category is migrants who are apprehended after crossing the border between official ports of entry without authorization. The second category is migrants who presented themselves at ports of entry without documentation and were deemed ""inadmissible.""
When referring to the total (the two categories added together), we should say more than 100,000 were ""taken into custody"" or ""detained,"" and we can refer to the migrants as ""unauthorized.""
""Apprehensions refers to the physical control or temporary detainment of a person who is not lawfully in the U.S. which may or may not result in an arrest.""
But is it a record? Hogan Gidley, White House principal deputy press secretary, was a guest on Sunday's All Things Considered , where he referred to people ""pouring into this country in record-setting numbers — 100,000-plus just last month alone.""
Again, that number he cited actually includes some people who asked to be admitted and were deemed ""inadmissible."" As for it being a record, it is — if you go back just one decade. As NPR has reported , the 103,000-plus number reported for March was ""the biggest monthly total in more than a decade,"" and officials are expecting a much higher total this month. It's also a record number of families.
But go back to 2000 and the number looks quite different in comparison. In fiscal year 2000, more than 1.6 million people were apprehended, NPR has reported ; that works out to a monthly average of more than 130,000. Want to be more confused? The number of border ""apprehensions"" (303,916) in fiscal year 2017 (ending Sept. 30, 2017) was the lowest since 1971 , making the surge of recent months even more striking (another 111,601 ""inadmissibles"" were reported in fiscal 2017).
Does the current number of people seeking to cross the border represent a ""crisis,"" as the Trump administration has said? That's a word many listeners and readers have objected to as taking the administration's side on the issue. Others on the opposite side of the political spectrum also have used the word , and I certainly think it's supportable, given NPR's reporting on how immigration authorities and social service providers at the border have been overwhelmed by the number of families needing help.
How to talk about ""illegal immigration"" As a reminder, here is NPR's language policy about the term ""illegal immigration,"" as laid out by Memmott:
- The debate is still about ""illegal immigration"" and what to do about it. ""Illegal immigration"" remains an acceptable term when we're reporting about the issue.
- When we're reporting about the people at the center of this story, it's still best practice to begin with action words, rather than labels. Two examples: They are ""in the country illegally"" or have ""entered the country illegally.""
- In subsequent references, we now think it's OK to mix in the phrases ""undocumented immigrants"" and ""unauthorized immigrants."" They are now in common usage. And, unlike the label ""illegal immigrants,"" they are not phrases sometimes used to hurt others. (Our approach on this language is similar to what we've said about the debate over health care — it is best practice to first refer to the law Republicans want to replace as the ""Affordable Care Act"". Then it's OK to say ""Obamacare."")
- ""Undocumented"" is also OK in headlines.
The word ""illegal"" always sparks email from listeners. Under both U.S. and international law, migrants who ask for asylum at a port of entry are not committing an illegal act. As the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services website notes , ""You may apply for asylum regardless of your immigration status, whether you are here legally or illegally."" But the act of crossing the border without papers, even if the intent is to ask for asylum, is illegal . Those are two different acts, which are often conflated.
Immigration is one of those issues that has become so heated that people read and hear the same words differently. The border situation is also confusing, so the language should be as clear as possible.

John Moore/Getty Images The language used to describe immigration is one of the most common topics of concern when we hear from NPR listeners and readers. That's no surprise, really, given the rapidly evolving nature of what is happening at the Southwest border and the way some words (""crisis"" and ""illegal"" come to mind) have been marshaled for political ends.
Advocates on both sides of the immigration issue want to paint the situation in stark terms for their own purposes. But, of course, that's not NPR's role. Its reporting should (and does) strive to present the information as factually and fairly as possible, so listeners and readers can make up their own minds about the issues discussed.
Apprehensions The word ""apprehensions"" (and its verb form, ""apprehended"") is one word sparking some recent debate.
When U.S. Customs and Border Protection releases its monthly reports about the number of migrants they are processing at the Southwest border, the official statistic is referred to as ""apprehensions and inadmissibles.""
NPR has used the term ""apprehended,"" rightly, going back many years, when talking about those arrested trying to enter the country illegally. Some readers and listeners have questioned whether it is the best word choice now that the nature of those ""apprehensions"" has so substantially changed in recent months.
Here's an explanation of what NPR is referring to when the word is used, and thoughts on some more precise language.
Webster's New World College Dictionary, Fifth Edition (NPR's dictionary of record) defines ""apprehend"" as ""to take into custody; capture or arrest."" That's what I think an average listener or reader would understand when reading that , say, ""The number of migrants apprehended at the border last month surpassed 103,000 — the highest level in more than a decade."" The ""capture"" part of the dictionary definition conjures up an element of someone trying to escape, to run away. But increasingly, that's not what's happening at the border. Nor does the 103,000-plus number actually reflect only ""apprehensions;"" it also includes what the government describes as ""inadmissibles"" (see below).
According to NPR's reporting team covering the issue, many migrants are crossing the border somewhere other than an official entry point and then presenting themselves, often in large family groups, to border agents and requesting asylum (though the percentage of the total requesting asylum is not included in the monthly report). Is it accurate, then, to describe these people as having been ""apprehended,"" a word that also implies attempting to evade the law?
Brian Lehrer, host of a talk program on WNYC, the NPR-affiliated public radio station in New York City, raised the issue last week in an interview with Washington Post immigration reporter Maria Sacchetti:
LEHRER: By the way, the technical term for being taken into custody at the border is ""apprehended."" That's what's on the official government sites. So when I did those stats and looked all the way back to 2000, that's what they call it: 'apprehensions at the border.' But is that even an accurate word for what's happening today? Aren't so many of these people coming to give themselves up so they can enter the asylum process?
SACCHETTI: Well they are... they are a majority — I mean, most them ... the bulk of them are families, parents and children or aunts and children, grandmothers and children. And they, they are surrendering in large groups — some as large as 300 people. And it's ... it's such a dramatic change. I mean, there are still single people adults sneaking in on their own and trying to avoid immigration authorities. But the border now is set up so well to detect them and to deport them that they're often apprehended also very quickly.
A much smaller number of migrants are presenting themselves at official points of entry and requesting asylum. Those migrants are included in the totals, but as ""inadmissibles."" For the month of March, the figures were 92,607 ""apprehensions"" and 10,885 ""inadmissibles."" The total is the 103,000-plus number.
I'm not sure that most listeners and readers would hear ""apprehended"" and realize what a vast range of actions that encompasses. While shorthand is always tempting to journalists trying to describe the big picture and get to the meat of policy questions, more precision in this case would help NPR's audience better understand the complicated border dynamics.
I like the way this Vox article referred to the broad number: as people who ""tried to enter the US without valid papers.""
As an alternative to ""apprehended"" or ""apprehensions"" alone — at least while the current trend of asylum-seekers turning themselves in to authorities persists — I like the way the digital version of this NPR story puts it, talking about people who were ""apprehended or surrendered."" Another good option would be to say these people had been ""taken into custody.""
Laura Smitherman, an NPR deputy national editor who has been overseeing the border coverage, suggested ""unauthorized border crossings."" And Mark Memmott, NPR's standards and practices editor, suggested that, ""maybe 'detained' is often best because if you are apprehended or you surrender you're going to be detained for at least a while.""
Meanwhile, Memmott last week issued this guidance to the newsroom, explaining more about what the U.S. Customs and Border Protection's data encompasses, and steering staff away from referring to them as ""arrests"":
There's an important footnote with U.S. Customs and Border Protection's data . It states that:
Most of the people CBP counts in its data are listed under the heading ""apprehensions.""
Don't simply say, then, that those who have crossed the southern border and been detained have been ""arrested."" Not everyone has been, or will be, charged with a crime. The best practice is to use ""apprehended"" or ""detained"" as the action words when reporting broadly about what is happening to people.

Kirk Siegler/NPR Five months after the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in California history, the town of Paradise remains a disaster zone. Only 6 percent of the debris from last November's Camp Fire has been hauled away. Burned out skeletons of cars, piles of toxic rubble and blackened old-growth pine trees can still be seen everywhere.
Before the wildfire, the population of Paradise was about 26,000. Today, it's in the hundreds.
The extent of the latest crisis unfolding in Paradise is yet unknown: The deadly fire may also have contaminated up to 173 miles of pipeline in the town's water system with cancer-causing benzene and other volatile organic compounds, or VOCs. Preliminary results have shown contamination in about a third of the lines tested, though only about 2 percent of the entire system has been sampled.
Still, the water crisis is just the latest setback that has called into question whether the town was ready to reopen.
And some have had no choice but to move back.
""As soon as the house was cleaned, our insurance company told us that we had to come home,"" says Kyla Awalt.
Awalt's home off Bille Road is the only one still eerily standing in the rubble of what used to be her neighborhood. Her family had planned to move back, eventually. In January, though, they were notified that their ""additional living expenses"" had run out. But there was no potable water in town then, nor is there today.
They considered selling. But how do you put a home on the market if it doesn't have any water?
""You can't,"" Awalt says. ""That's part of the inspection process.""
So they bought a huge water tank, out of pocket, for $6,500. It's sitting beneath the shade of an old walnut tree along the fence line of her property. On the other side of the fence is the rubble of what used to be her neighbor's home. There are piles of debris and a couple of mangled, burnt lawn mowers waiting to be hauled away.
The Awalts spend $250 to fill the water tank every few weeks. It's expensive, but it's peace of mind.
""It's kind of up to the homeowner,"" Awalt says. ""It's on them to figure it out.""
Before the Camp Fire, Paradise was known as a bedroom community as well as an affordable haven for retirees. Much of the population tended to skew lower income, and the idea that they're now being left to fend for themselves is alarming to experts like Andrew Whelton.
""That's not protecting public health,"" says Whelton, a civil engineer who built his career advising the U.S. military on how to restore water infrastructure after disasters. ""That's not what we're supposed to be doing with a population that has gone under trauma like this; we're supposed to help them.""
National PG&E Says Its Equipment Likely Caused Camp Fire, As Investigation Continues National 'Reimagining Paradise' — Making Plans To Rebuild A Town Destroyed By Wildfire Whelton, now at Purdue University, has recently been consulting with the town's primary water supplier, the Paradise Irrigation District. The utility is trying to pinpoint the source of the contamination, whether it's from burnt plastic pipes and meters or from the toxic waste from burnt structures that was flushed into the town's water pipes. Much of the town's housing stock was older and didn't have back-flow protection.
""The scale of the recovery effort and the testing that's needed in my experience here will be unprecedented,"" Whelton says.
It's likely unprecedented, but it's also a warning to other cities in high risk wildfire zones.
The district's manager, Kevin Phillips, says his staff is overwhelmed.
""There is no playbook for a wildfire that destroys a town and you have a depressurization of a system that creates contamination,"" Phillips says.
There are 10,500 service lines in the district's system, which was built in the 1950s and already had a reputation of being outdated and haphazardly designed. Phillips says the plan is to prioritize testing in neighborhoods where homes are still standing and to shut down and isolate the contaminated places.
The system will take years to fix. The testing alone could take more than two years.
""We feel like we are under the microscope of the nation right now, that we are going to be the reason why the town doesn't rebuild. ... If there's no water, there's no town,"" Phillips says.
But Phillips says they won't do anything hastily that would jeopardize public health. As more people try to move back, the utility hopes to buy and deliver tanks with potable water — a program will hopefully begin later this month. But no one knows yet who will pay for that.
Whelton worries that means folks living here will continue to be exposed to yet unknown risks.

toggle caption Kirk Siegler/NPR Paradise Irrigation District manager Kevin Phillips shows a sample of the town's water pipes, which were frequently woven between underground root systems that were likely burned during the fire.
Kirk Siegler/NPR ""In a disaster of this scale, that is one of the takeaways here,"" he says. ""In the absence of any credible authority providing help to a population, they will do what it takes to survive.""
For now, there are strict warnings that people moving back in should not drink or even boil the water, let alone use it for any household activity unless it has been tested. Whelton says some residents are buying water filtration systems that aren't proven to be safe enough to handle the high VOC readings, or they're relying on a single-point-in-time test for contaminants.
Seventy-nine-year-old Pat Zinn, whose home of four decades was spared, got her water tested three months ago. It showed the all clear.
""They did say it could change so I should have it retested, but it's $100 every time you have it tested, so I guess I'm gambling,"" Zinn says.
Zinn is drinking the free bottled water, but she's using tap water for most everything else.
""Something's going to get me one of these days anyway,"" Zinn says. ""So I'm not really that concerned about it.""
She chuckles as she tries to make light of the latest setback in front of her town's recovery. She's mostly concerned about Paradise's survival, which she says hinges on its water crisis being solved.
""That's the big thing,"" she says. ""If we don't have that taken care of the town is going to die."""

The plea comes with a four-year term in New Jersey state prison, prosecutors say.
Burlington County Prosecutor's Office via AP A New Jersey woman pleaded guilty Monday to theft by deception for perpetrating what began as a story of redemption that was revealed to be a ruse.
Katelyn McClure appeared in New Jersey Superior Court, admitting to her role in duping thousands of people out of $400,000 through a fictionalized GoFundMe page purporting to benefit a homeless veteran said to have bought her gas.
McClure, 29, will serve a four-year-term in a New Jersey state prison under the plea, according to the Burlington County Prosecutor's Office . Sentencing is set for June 3.
National New Jersey Couple's GoFundMe Campaign To Help Homeless Man 'Was Predicated On A Lie' In March , McClure pleaded guilty in federal court to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, which carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine. Federal sentencing is scheduled for June 19.
The homeless man, Johnny Bobbitt, 36, also pleaded guilty in both federal and state courts to charges related to the hoax. He has been admitted into a state drug treatment program , which could help him avoid some prison time. He has not been sentenced at the federal level.
National Lawyer For Homeless Man Says $400,000 Raised To Help Him Is Gone ""However,"" the Burlington County Prosecutor's Office said in a statement, ""if Bobbitt fails to adhere to the tightly-structured regimen of treatment and recovery services, which includes frequent testing for drug use, he could be sentenced to five years in state prison.""
A third person, Mark D'Amico, McClure's then-boyfriend, is also charged with theft by deception. His case is set to be presented next month to a Burlington County grand jury for possible indictment.
McClure's lawyer has said D'Amico was the driving force behind the scheme, and prosecutors say that McClure and Bobbitt have agreed to testify against him.
In November 2017, McClure and D'Amico created a GoFundMe Page titled ""Paying It Forward."" It said that McClure was driving home from Philadelphia on Interstate 95 when she ran out of gas and that Bobbitt, a homeless veteran, came to her rescue, spending his last $20 to buy her gas. With a photo of the duo standing by the road, the page solicited donations to help get Bobbitt off the street, with the goal of raising $10,000.
The money came pouring in after the media picked up on the story. Fourteen thousand people donated $400,000 in less than three weeks, according to prosecutors, none the wiser to the fact that McClure had never run out of gas and Bobbitt never spent $20 to help her.
Shots - Health News Patients Are Turning To GoFundMe To Fill Health Insurance Gaps D'Amico and McClure were quick to spend the money on themselves, prosecutors say, blowing through the bulk of the $400,000 on gambling, a helicopter ride over the Grand Canyon, a BMW, clothing and Louis Vuitton handbags.
But the cover soon began to fall apart.
In December of 2017, the then-couple deposited $25,000 in a bank account they set up for Bobbitt, according to authorities. When Bobbitt realized most of the money had been squandered, he sued them.
Authorities said they found text messages from McClure admitting to the hoax, as NPR's Vanessa Romo reported in November :
""After scouring more than 67,000 texts on the couple's phones, officials discovered a text exchange between McClure and a friend written less than an hour after the GoFundMe page went live that appears to confirm it was all a hoax.
"" 'Ok, so wait. The gas part is completely made up but the guy isn't,' McClure allegedly texted. 'I had to make something up to make people feel bad. So shush about the made up stuff.' ""
Burlington County Prosecutor Scott Coffina said that McClure and Bobbitt had known each other for at least a month before setting up the fundraising page. Coffina noted that Bobbitt had previously posted a tale of a stranded woman with an empty gas tank to whom he gave the last of his money in 2012. ""I don't think that's a coincidence,"" he said.
But federal prosecutors allege it was McClure and D'Amico who concocted the story and only informed Bobbitt about it after donations started pouring in.
In December, GoFundMe announced it was refunding donors who had contributed to the campaign."
Colorado's Oil And Gas Regulators Must Now Consider Public Health And Safety,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/16/712877704/colorados-oil-and-gas-regulators-must-now-consider-public-health-and-safety?station=KXJZ_FM,"Enlarge this image A drilling rig at work near a residential neighborhood in Erie, Colo.

Grace Hood/CPR After years of tension over expanded oil and gas drilling, including a deadly explosion that galvanized critics, Colorado is moving to tighten regulations on the booming industry. In a sweeping overhaul the governor is expected to sign, regulators will now have to consider public health, safety and the environment in decisions about permitting and local land use.
The state must still hammer out the details of how to implement the new law over the next year. But the impending changes are already fueling hope for some, and fear for others.
""Oil and gas leaves, we're gone""
""We just had our largest order from an oil and gas worker,"" says Matt Smith, owner of Daddy's Goodness BBQ outside Greeley, as the lunch-hour rush crowded around the window of his bright red food truck.
Smith changed careers to start the business two years ago. ""Oil and gas leaves, we're gone,"" he says.
Greeley is the epicenter of Colorado's oil and gas development. Weld County is where 90 percent of Colorado's oil is pumped, and the region hosts oil companies, secondary companies that truck water and supplies to well pads, and companies like Smith's that depend on business from the oil fields. Many who live in Greeley oppose the changes.

Grace Hood/CPR ""There's a lot of anger, but I think beneath that anger is a lot of fear,"" says Barbara Kirkmeyer, Weld County commissioner. ""A lot of people are scared of what can happen here.""
The new law would give cities and counties more control over where oil wells go. It would also shift the state's mandate from fostering oil and gas development to regulating it, with a focus on the environment and people's safety. The Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission will get new members with environmental and public health expertise.
The legislation also launches rule-makings in half a dozen areas, including flow lines, and limiting potent methane leaks from oil and gas infrastructure.
Weld County officials worry those new rules could slow the approval of new drilling permits — already backlogged — and curtail a crucial cash flow. In 2018, oil and gas production contributed $490 million in tax revenue, about 60 percent of the county's overall tax dollars.
Environment Microplastic Found Even In The Air In France's Pyrenees Mountains Jeff Robbins, director of the state's Oil and Gas Conservation Commission, says it will continue to process permits even as it implements the new rules.
Still, companies could see new hurdles, including rising costs for permit applications.
More local control over where drilling can happen
Perhaps the biggest shift will be giving local communities more control in regulating oil and gas development. South of Greeley, residents of Erie, Colo., have been pushing for that as they've watched multiple drilling projects come through their neighborhoods.
""The first time when they were close to us and drilling, you could actually feel the vibration in our house,"" says Robin Goldsmith, as she loads her aging terrier into her SUV.
That first well pad was about 1,000 feet away. That's more than double the distance from homes that the state requires, so there wasn't much she could do to stop it.
""Hopefully [the new law] will make a difference, because in this particular area — in Erie, in Broomfield — there is a ton of activity going on,"" she says.
The push for more restrictions gained traction two years ago. That's when two people died after a home explosion not far away from Erie, in Firestone. An underground line from a well had leaked gas.
Goldsmith does not share concerns that the new law will prompt an economic slowdown for the industry. ""That's the oil and gas companies making sure that their investments are protected, as opposed to the good of the people,"" she says.

Grace Hood/CPR Legal pressures and what comes next
Ultimately it will be up to towns, cities and counties to decide if they want to tackle new rules on oil and gas development. In Erie, town trustee Christiaan van Woudenberg ran for office on a platform against fracking and plans to start the process soon. But he says it will be tricky.
He worries about a last-minute change to the legislation favored by industry. It restricts communities to doing only what's ""necessary and reasonable"" to protect health and safety.
""So lawyers will decide what that means,"" van Woudenberg says. ""And the problem is that these oil and gas companies have access to resources magnitudes of orders beyond a town council like Erie.""
Some worry that imbalance could prevent communities from tackling rule-making altogether. Anne Lee Foster, of the environmental group Colorado Rising, says local officials may be deterred ""for fear of being litigated and not having the resources to properly defend their communities.""
Last fall, Colorado Rising supported a ballot measure that would have imposed a 2,500-foot distance between oil wells and homes, but it failed to pass.
The group says it will watch closely to see how the new law plays out. If community controls are stymied by industry in the courts, Foster says, Colorado Rising will float a statewide ballot issue in 2020, trying yet again to get even more local control.
But first, opponents of the latest restrictions on oil and gas development may have their shot at a redo. They're already campaigning for a ballot measure to repeal the law."
Trio Of Bald Eagles In Illinois Is Caring For Three Eaglets,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/16/713767032/an-unusual-family-of-bald-eagles-adds-three-eaglets?station=KXJZ_FM,"Enlarge this image Starr, a female bald eagle, looks over her eaglets in a nest along the Mississippi River in April.

Stewards of Upper Mississippi River Refuge via AP You can tell Tolstoy that not every happy family is alike after all.
Along the Mississippi River in Illinois lives an unusual family of six bald eagles. Two males and one female are caring for three eaglets — with the world watching on a livestream .
The two males, Valor I and Valor II, and the female, Starr, have been together since 2017, in the backwaters of the Upper Mississippi River National Wildlife and Fish Refuge.
Earlier that year the males' first partner, Hope, disappeared after a violent attack by other eagles. But the males stayed together and courted Starr, which experts say is a remarkable twist to an already unusual situation — bald eagle trios have been documented before, but rarely, according to the Audubon Society .
The birds saw three eggs hatch this year at the end of March and the beginning of April.
Stewards of the Upper Mississippi River Refuge via YouTube The unnamed eaglets, once tiny bundles covered in soft, gray down with wobbly legs and partially closed eyes, are now getting old enough to hold their heads up for feeding. They are just weeks away from being able to walk and tear up their own food — and eventually fly on their own.
And their parents are always keeping the pantry full, according to the Stewards of the Upper Mississippi River Refuge . On the menu are fish, fowl and the occasional muskrat and turtle.
It's an all-hands-on-deck co-parenting situation, with all three taking a role in maintaining the nest, incubating the eggs and raising the young, according to the stewards.
As the Audubon Society writes, ""Refuge biologists don't know for sure whether Valor I and Valor II have both fathered eaglets in this case, but based on the mating they've observed, the odds are good.""
And the trio is expected to stay together, say the stewards, as eagles mate for life.
Meanwhile in southwest Florida, two longtime bald eagle residents have recovered from nest devastation to hatch two eaglets of their own.
The pine tree that housed "" Vic and Nic "" toppled during Hurricane Irma in 2017, according to Eagle Country , which operates the livestream of their nest. The couple rebuilt in an adjacent tree, but their nest was blown out of the tree late last year. They hustled to rebuild and laid their first eggs just over a month later.
A few months out, eaglets Dandy and Spur appear to be healthy, with voracious appetites and their long, black juvenile feathers growing in.
There's been no such luck for the star eagles of Washington, D.C.
The National Arboretum's popular couple , Mr. President and the First Lady, haven't laid any eggs. Neither have Liberty and Justice , a pair living on the grounds of the D.C. Police Academy. Experts predict no eaglets for the two couples this year, as the brief window for breeding comes to a close, The Washington Post reports .
Mr. President and the First Lady's Twitter page acknowledged the empty nest. ""Who was the wise guy who said 'If you build it, they will come?' "" the account tweeted .
Okay Honey, now I’m starting to get impatient! #americaneaglefoundation #naeaglecam #mrpresident #firstlady #fona #usna #baldeagles #DC pic.twitter.com/lq07KNEiff
— Mr. P & First Lady (@naeaglecam) April 13, 2019 The couple lost one of their eaglets last year. The eaglet, Valor, was born in the spring and grew into a sleek, young bird, under the watchful eye of his parents and the many eyes of online eagle-watchers. But in midsummer he fell from the nesting tree. When he was taken to a bird rescue and research facility, he was found to be severely underweight and tested positive for West Nile Virus. Researchers said it was ""extremely unlikely"" that he would recover, and they euthanized him in August.
Valor I, Valor II and Starr have also known their share of loss. When the trio of bald eagles hatched their first eaglets together last year, one died of unknown causes before it could take its first flight.
While eaglet deaths are a blow to observers, they're a relatively common phenomenon. According to the stewards , as many as 70 to 80 percent of bald eagles in the wild die before they reach adulthood at five years of age.
But fans are undeterred by that fragility. Just like the beloved eagles of Washington, D.C., the Illinois trio has drawn a group of dedicated fans.
""Beautiful family,"" one woman wrote on Facebook . ""I watch every day.""
On another night, when storms blew through northern Illinois, another commenter wrote in with relief that the family had emerged unscathed.
""I was sending out prayers for them last night, when these storms were going through,"" she wrote. ""How scary for them! God Bless them."""

Workers on an oil rig about 135 miles offshore from southern Thailand noticed something stunning in the water: a dog.
The animal swam toward the rig's platform on Friday and clung to it as team members tried to figure out how to save him, Vitisak Payalaw, an offshore planner for Chevron Thailand Exploration & Production, told NPR.
Video that Payalaw posted on Facebook shows the shivering animal partially submerged in water, staring up at the workers.
Payalaw said he and three members of his team spent 15 minutes working to secure the dog with a rope and pull him up to safety. They were racing against time, he said, because the seas were becoming rougher.

In the first photos Payalaw posted, the dog looks exhausted — ""especially on his eyes"" — and despondent. Workers provided him with water and pieces of meat on the deck of the rig, and they set up a kennel for him indoors.
They named him Boonrod, Payalaw added, a word that means ""he has done good karma and that helps him to survive.""
It's not clear how the dog ended up so many miles offshore. Payalaw declined to speculate, simply saying it is still a mystery. The Bangkok Post said the pup is ""believed to have fallen from a fishing trawler.""
Boonrod appeared to be steadily growing stronger, after eating and napping. After a day and a half, he looked happy and alert — and he was clearly popular with the oil rig team.

The pup has now been transferred to land, arriving in Thailand's Songkhla province on Monday morning to receive veterinary care coordinated by the rescue group Watchdog Thailand. According to The Associated Press, the group has declared him ""in good shape.""
Photos posted by the organization showed a triumphant-looking Boonrod being greeted by rescue group workers and veterinarians. They placed a fetching bright yellow floral wreath around his neck as Boonrod flashed a bright smile.
The dog was later shown receiving a bath, playing with admirers and eating treats.
Boonrod's streak of good luck seems set to continue. Payalaw says he's going to be working on the rig until the end of April, but when he gets back to shore, he plans to adopt the dog."

Paul Hawthorne/Getty Images Updated at 2:17 p.m. ET
Actress Georgia Engel, whose winning role on The Mary Tyler Moore Show led to a long career on-screen, has died at age 70.
From 1972 to 1977, Engel played sweet, artless Georgette, the girlfriend and then wife of arrogant news anchor Ted Baxter. She explained how the role that cemented her career came to be, in a 2007 interview with the Toronto Star .
""It was only going to be one episode,"" Engel said, ""and I was just supposed to have a few lines in a party scene, but they kept giving me more and more to do."" The next Monday, she said, there was a buzz at the door and a giant potted plant with a note welcoming her to the Mary Tyler Moore family.
The role had been written just for her, Engel said.
Paolo Durgan YouTube She died on April 12 in Princeton, N.J., her agent, Jacqueline Stander, confirmed. The cause of death is not known; Engel was a Christian Scientist who did not consult doctors.
""She was a young 70,"" Stander told NPR. ""She was just a wonderful being. ... I will miss her and I know the world will miss her.""
Engel found plenty of television work in the decades that followed The Mary Tyler Moore Show, with recurring roles on Coach, Everybody Loves Raymond and three seasons of TV Land's Hot In Cleveland alongside her former Mary Tyler Moore Show co-star Betty White. She also appeared on The Love Boat, Two and a Half Men and The Office .
The Two-Way She Turned The World On With Her Smile: Mary Tyler Moore Dies At 80 ""She could get a laugh on literally every line you gave her,"" Everybody Loves Raymond creator Philip Rosenthal told The New York Times . ""I've never seen anything like it.""
YouTube Engel also had a career onstage, appearing in the original Broadway productions of Hello, Dolly! in 1964 and The Drowsy Chaperone in 2006. Last year she starred in the musical Half Time, as a member of a senior hip-hop dance team that performs at NBA games. Her role was ""a kindergarten teacher with a gangsta rap alter ego,"" according to Playbill .

The Mekons are first-generation British punk rockers who've moved through an array of genres over the decades. Their most recent album was recorded in a studio just outside Joshua Tree National Park.
DAVE DAVIES, HOST:
This is FRESH AIR.
(SOUNDBITE OF THE MEKONS SONG, ""ANDROMEDA"")
DAVIES: The Mekons are a British band. But to make ""Deserted,"" their first new album in eight years, the group went to a California studio just outside Joshua Tree National Park. The band says the rugged landscape informed the highly diverse collection of songs they wrote for the album. Rock critic Ken Tucker has this review of ""Deserted.""
(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""ANDROMEDA"")
THE MEKONS: (Singing) Lying in this cot, andromeda above this cot. On the ground, creatures creep about. The dirt don't care.
KEN TUCKER, BYLINE: The Mekons are first-generation punk rockers formed in 1977, who have moved through an array of styles and genres over the decades. They've played British-style folk music, American-style country and their own unique, bashed-out variation on rock 'n' roll. They've broken up and reassembled more than once. And nominal leader Jon Langford, at various points, was at least as much of a visual artist as anything else, painting many striking portraits of classic country stars. The band is back together with many of its key members intact, including Sally Timms, who sings the ghostly lead vocal on this track, ""In The Desert.""
(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""IN THE DESERT"")
THE MEKONS: (Singing) In the desert, artillery takes its time. Pounds and recoils, shell after shell. Sunk in the sand, a shattered statue lies. Nothing survives. In the desert, nothing survives.
TUCKER: Although they're a British band, The Mekons have made Chicago, the home of their record label, a base of operations at various points. But most of ""Deserted"" was written in the desert. Jon Langford says that the group had been writing songs in spare moments on the road during a concert tour, but the material didn't feel right. They heard about this studio outside of Joshua Tree National Park. When they arrived, they found the landscape, to quote Langford, ""inspirational to old pirate punk rockers.""
(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""LAWRENCE OF CALIFORNIA"")
THE MEKONS: (Singing) Lawrence of California, get out of the van and disappear. Hello. Teeth flash yellow over your shoulder as the dusty walls move in. And nothing is near. Get out of the van and disappear. Every seed is a weapon here. And soon I'll be the king.
TUCKER: That's ""Lawrence Of California,"" the band's technicolor movie - a big rock tune that equates the 1962 Peter O'Toole desert epic ""Lawrence Of Arabia"" with the harsh landscape the band found in Joshua Tree. The Mekons is an ongoing art project that's always reaching back to illustrate the present. Take, for example, their song ""Weimar Vending Machine."" It's a gleefully elusive yet beautiful composition about a country collapsing into chaotic hostility. It's a history song that sounds right up to the minute.
(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""WEIMAR VENDING MACHINE"")
THE MEKONS: (Singing) Stranger in a strange land. Strange to have no better plan. Iggy pops up in Berlin at a Weimar vending machine. Press S-A-N-D for a sandwich. Out pops a prepacked bag of sand. Ten thousand grains in a kleine packet. He can hide it in his hand.
TUCKER: The Mekons look to history again on ""Harar 1883."" The title is a reference to the city of Harar, Ethiopia. In 1883, the French poet Arthur Rimbaud went there to escape from the European poetry world and gained some new life experiences while still in his mid-20s. The considerably older members of The Mekons tell the story with dramatic flair.
(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""HARAR 1883"")
THE MEKONS: (Singing) I wrap my scarf around my head tight against the desert dread. Wind blown hard across the sand. Bullet marks that scar my hand. Back home, they think I've disappeared. Yes, it's true that I deserted that Dutch army in the east. I was not troubled in the least to give up writing poetry. I traded coffee in Abyssinia. I was the only European, Haile Selassie's father's friend.
TUCKER: ""Deserted"" is an album that, like the best of The Mekons' collections, is intentionally difficult to get a fix on. It leaps around in sound and style, frequently beginning in one genre and ending in another in the space of a single song. Ultimately, it coheres as a series of arguments for the value of restlessness, for ceaseless exploration - which is just what The Mekons have been doing for more than 40 years.
DAVIES: Ken Tucker reviewed the new album ""Deserted"" by The Mekons. On tomorrow's show, actor Christopher Meloni. You may recognize him from his 12 seasons as a detective on ""Law And Order: SVU"" or his turn as a sociopathic inmate in the prison drama ""Oz."" He stars as an ex-cop turned hitman who collaborates with an imaginary unicorn played by Patton Oswalt in the series ""Happy!"" on the SyFy channel. Hope you can join us.

DAVE DAVIES, HOST:
This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies, in for Terry Gross, who's off this week. If you want to hear some alarming facts about climate change, Bill McKibben has them. He writes in his new book that as the Earth warms, we're now seeing lethal heatwaves in some parts of the world and that the largest physical structures on our planet - the ice caps, coral reefs and rainforests - are disappearing before our eyes.
McKibben's been writing about and advocating for action on climate change since the 1980s, but his new book isn't just a warning of impending disaster. And it isn't just about climate change. McKibben says there are also threats to humanity as we know it from human genetic engineering and from the unbridled development of artificial intelligence. Bill McKibben has written 15 books and is the founder of the environmental organization 350.org. His new book, which offers some dark visions of the future and hope for real change, is called ""Falter: Has the Human Game Begun to Play Itself Out?""
Bill McKibben, welcome back to FRESH AIR. You know, you note that climate change is such a familiar term that - you know, like urban sprawl or, you know, gun violence that it's sort of a part of our journalistic lexicon. And there's been a lot of alarming information about climate change. And when I read your book, I found even more alarming information. And I think it's worth dwelling on it just a little bit. One of the things that struck me was heat waves - not heat waves 50 years from now but heat waves today. What are we finding?
BILL MCKIBBEN: Well, we're already finding heat that taxes the ability of the human body to endure it. The highest reliably recorded temperatures on Earth have happened in the last couple of years. They've been in parts of the Mideast and the Asian subcontinent where city temperatures have reached 129 degrees. When they try to factor in the humidity and dew point, people have been describing - feels like temperatures as high as 165 degrees. I mean, 129 degrees Fahrenheit - that's about where my oven begins, you know? And a human being can survive it maybe for a few hours inside, in the shade. But they can't survive it long term. And the scientists are telling us without any hesitation that, on current trends, by the middle or latter part of the century, vast swaths of the planet will be experiencing those temperatures for weeks on end. And there'll be, in essence, no-go zones for human beings, no-go zones in those continental interiors but also, of course, no-go zones along the coasts where the oceans are rising and where storms are getting more powerful. The game board on which we play the game of human beings is shrinking and shrinking dramatically for the first time since humans wandered out of Africa and started expanding their range.
DAVIES: It's shrinking because coastlines are receding but also because there are places where people can only survive by cowering together in air conditioning.
MCKIBBEN: That's right. And there've become severe limits to how long you can make that work. Already, the World Labor Organization (ph) says that human beings are able to do about 10 percent less work in the course of a day outdoors than they used to be able to. It's simply gotten too hot and too humid. By mid-century, that number will be something like 30 percent less work. Really, the ability to be human is starting to vanish in many, many places.
DAVIES: What's happening with food supplies? And what can we expect?
MCKIBBEN: Well, human beings have had a great run of increasing their supply of food since the end of World War II. But as the Green Revolution begins to play itself out, coming the other direction are these vast heatwaves and shortages of water. And so we're already seeing real effects. I mean, the Arab Spring was triggered in large part by the rise of wheat prices that followed epic drought. The hideous civil war in Syria was triggered in part by epic drought, the deepest drought in the history of what we used to call the Fertile Crescent, that drove a million farmers off their land and into the already destabilized cities of the brutal Assad regime. And we see how those things play out not just in those places but around the world. The refugees that streamed out of Syria were enough to undermine the politics of Western Europe. The refugees now fleeing the highlands of Guatemala and Honduras, where drought has made raising crops an ever iffier proposition, they're, you know, showing up on the southern border and being used as scapegoats by the most vicious elements of our political culture.
DAVIES: So climate change-related drought is what's driving the surge of immigrants?
MCKIBBEN: There's a terrific story on the front page of The Sunday Times talking about precisely how destabilizing the drought and heat has been. If you look at a map of Central America, it's one of the few places in the world where there are big oceans close by on either side. As, you know, the oceans are soaking up most of the excess heat that we're producing. And that makes places like that particularly vulnerable to kind of whipsaw changes in temperature.
DAVIES: And fire. I mean, we've focused a lot on the fires in California because they are nearby. And we see them on television. And they've affected and killed a lot of people. But you write that there are really alarming fires in other parts of the world that we don't pay as much attention to.
MCKIBBEN: There are fires in places where there never used to be. I mean, we're seeing routinely now fires 3, 4, 5 degrees of latitude north of where we ever saw them - across Siberia, across much of the Arctic. It's just gotten too hot and too dry. But we shouldn't skip lightly over those California fires, either. I mean, when you look at a place literally called Paradise that literally turned into hell inside half an hour, you begin to understand how the psychological space that we inhabit is beginning to shrink, too.
DAVIES: You know, you also write about - the city of Houston, for example, has taken on so much water through Hurricane Harvey and an earlier storm that the sheer weight of it actually made the city sink a couple of centimeters. And I wonder - you know, some people said don't confuse weather with climate. You can't connect any specific weather event to climate change. Is it clear that we're seeing something different in the weather as a result of what's happening to the planet?
MCKIBBEN: Yeah, absolutely. Scientists have gotten good at what they call attribution studies. They say, for instance, in the case of Hurricane Harvey that the rainfall was about 40 percent heavier than it would've been without the heating that went on. Warm air holds more water vapor than cold. You get more evaporation. That's why in arid areas, you get more drought. But then once that water is up in the atmosphere, it comes down. And it comes down increasingly in deluge. I mean, look. The - Hurricane Harvey's the perfect example. There were parts of Houston that got near onto 5 feet of water. Not long afterwards, we had the biggest rainfall in the history of the East Coast with the hurricane that hit the Carolinas last fall. It dumped the water equivalent of all of Chesapeake Bay on the Carolinas. So these are entirely unprecedented. And they're happening everywhere. The most tragic example at the moment perhaps is what's going on in Mozambique where Cyclone Idai is being called the worst natural disaster in the history of the Southern Hemisphere. It flooded a vast part of Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Malawi.
DAVIES: And before we leave this subject, what is expected in terms of climate refugees in the coming decades? That is to say people who have no choice but to flee either the encroachment of the sea or other changes associated with climate change?
MCKIBBEN: The low end of the U.N. prediction is on the neighborhood of 200 million. The high end is closer to a billion. And as we said before, if you look at the havoc that...
DAVIES: And that's how soon? How soon is that?
MCKIBBEN: In the course of the century, yeah. If you look at the havoc wreaked by a million refugees coming out of the Middle East or Central America, you get some sense of how unprepared as a world we are for that. This is one reason why, whatever else you might want to say about them, the Pentagon has, at least in this respect, been quite reality-based. And while the rest of Trump's Washington is pretending climate change doesn't exist, the Pentagon continues to warn that this is a huge threat to stability, which it is, because people on the move are, by nature, destabilizing.
It's one of the most fraught things we have coming at us. The idea that anybody's going to be immune from this anywhere is untrue because even, if at the moment, your part of the world is not suffering through some catastrophe, it's going to be dealing with the people who are.
DAVIES: Our guest is Bill McKibben. His new book is called ""Falter: Has The Human Game Begun To Play Itself Out?"" We'll talk some more after a short break. This is FRESH AIR.
(SOUNDBITE OF BOBBY PREVITE & THE NEW BUMP SONG, ""SHE HAS INFORMATION"")
DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. Our guest is Bill McKibben. He's been writing about and advocating for action on climate change since the 1980s. He's written 15 books. His latest is called ""Falter: Has The Human Game Begun To Play Itself Out?""
In the book, you talk about what we've known and what we've done about this, going back to the '80s, when scientists began to clearly identify what was happening and the threat that it posed. And somehow, our politicians - even those, you write, who recognize the change - have just engaged in baby steps when serious measures are needed. Why?
MCKIBBEN: Well, the story of why we've done so little is, in some ways, the most painful part of this whole affair, you know? When I wrote ""The End Of Nature,"" I was 27, and so it did not occur to me that our institutions would show themselves to be so timorous and slow. We've come to understand more of how that happened in the last few years.
Great investigative reporting at places like The LA Times and The Columbia Journalism Review and InsideClimate News and elsewhere have documented, beyond any doubt, that the fossil fuel companies knew everything there was to know about climate change in the 1980s. They knew how much it was going to warm and how fast, and they believed it. I mean, Exxon began building all its drilling rigs to compensate for the rise in sea level they knew was coming.
What they didn't do was tell any of the rest of us - just the opposite. Beginning right about 1989 or so, they began to pour huge sums of money into this architecture of deceit and denial and disinformation that kept us locked for 30 years in a sterile debate about whether or not global warming was real, a debate that both sides knew the answer to at the beginning. It's just one of them was completely willing to lie, and that lie turns out to be the most consequential lie in human history, I think. It's the thing, more than anything else, that's kept us from reacting with any speed or vigor to the greatest challenge humans have ever faced.
DAVIES: Right. And I just want to note - since, Bill McKibben, you're an activist on this and have a strong point of view - that there's a very rich documentary history of this on the Internet if anybody wants to look it up and kind of look at what Exxon says, which is that this is a distorted view of what they did. I mean, I did note that a couple of Harvard researchers looked at this and concluded that, yes, there were moments when Exxon placed, you know, advertorials or, you know, paid statements which acknowledged the human nature of climate change and the need to fight it, but that when you look at where most of their communication was, and particularly where they put their money into research and advocacy, it was to question the reality of it all.
MCKIBBEN: Yes. I mean - and it's completely true that I'm an activist, but it's also true that there are hundreds of footnotes in this book. I'm a reporter and writer above all. And this is just part of the story that's, I think, beyond any real doubt. The question now is how to pick up the pieces.
Here's the problem. Thirty years ago - and I suppose I should avoid saying, you know, if only you'd listened to me when - but 30 years ago, there were relatively small things we could've done that would've changed the trajectory of this battle. A small price on carbon back then would've yielded a different trajectory, would've put us in a different - we might not have solved climate change yet 'cause it's a huge problem, but we'd be on the way.
Having wasted 30 years, doing nothing at the behest of the powers that be, we're now left with a set of very uncomfortable and difficult choices. We have to move much more quickly than is convenient, politically, economically, socially. But what choice do we have? I mean, in the end, this isn't a fight between Republicans and Democrats or environmentalists and industry. It's, in the end, a fight between human beings and physics. And physics is poor at compromise, doesn't negotiate easily. We're going to have to do what physics demands.
DAVIES: You know, you write that another element of this is that around the time that this issue was raised by a lot of scientists in the 1980s, you saw inequality in the country, inequality in wealth and income increasing and a lot of players in the political and intellectual world pushing a different vision of the relationship between government and individuals, which really found some purchase. You want to just talk about that a bit?
MCKIBBEN: Sure. Look. The - this was one of these perfect examples of bad timing. Right at the moment that the reigning ideology in America - the most important country on Earth, at least during this period. Right at the crucial moment, its reigning ideology became a kind of laissez faire capitalism - unregulated capitalism. Let markets solve all problems. Government, as Ronald Reagan said, isn't the solution. It's the problem - on and on and on. That meant that there was no appetite for doing the kind of regulation that we needed to do to try to rein in climate change when it was easy to do it. That organized selfishness - that's set us back and set us back hard.
We're beginning to see the reaction to it with things like the Green New Deal and a big, new focus on dealing with inequality and with climate change and figuring out how they mesh together. It's just that we've waited a long time.
The thing never to forget, Dave, about climate change is it's the first timed test that humans have ever had. And the time part is what scares me. It's too bad that this moment of ideological ascension just happened to come in the time and the place when there was enough leverage that, perhaps, it broke the planet in the process.
DAVIES: You know, it also occurs to me that one of the fundamental problems in the past 30 years and ongoing is that, you know, yes, we are one species, and we share the same planet. But our instrument of policy is primarily nation-states who compete with one another and, you know, are unlikely or can be resistant to making change if others don't or can point an accusing finger, you know, like, I'm not as bad as they are. How much of that is the problem? And how do we overcome it?
MCKIBBEN: Well, it is a big problem. And it's one of the reasons that action has been so slow. I fear that the biggest part of that problem may be right here. I mean, you'll remember that the world finally managed to reach, at least, a beginning of an effort to do something about this at the Paris Accords in 2015 - not anywhere near a perfect agreement but certainly a start and the first time that all the countries of the world came together to pledge some kind of action.
And then you'll recall that our president pulled us out of it. You know, the country that has poured more carbon into the atmosphere than any other over the course of human history is also the only country on the planet unwilling to even pay lip service to taking on this problem.
The good news is that some other countries seem to be sort of rising to the occasion. China is putting in renewable energy at a pace like we've never seen on the planet before. Maybe even more importantly, India - which is, in energy terms, probably where China was 15 or 20 years ago - seems like it might be poised to become the first great nation that, at least to some degree, skips over the coal-fired part of development and moves straight to renewable energy.
The engineers have done such a remarkable job over the last decade - the price of a solar panel has fallen 90 percent - that it simply makes no economic sense anymore to keep doing what we're doing. And that's why, at the moment, India, for instance, is building far more renewable energy than they are conventionally powered power plants.
DAVIES: You know, one thing that you write about in the book, which I didn't know, is that the coal industry is promoting itself as the solution for economic poverty or energy poverty in much of the developing world.
MCKIBBEN: This was their big shtick a few years ago as protest and activism began to erode their market share in places like the U.S. They - kind of like Philip Morris before them - turned to the developing world as their salvation, arguing that they were somehow going to solve energy poverty and turn on the lights for places where they hadn't been before. It turns out that they were either insincere or dead wrong about that argument. That's not what's turning on the lights. Ninety percent of the people who are getting power for the first time now are getting it from renewable energy because it's so cheap.
DAVIES: Bill McKibben's new book is ""Falter: Has The Human Game Begun To Play Itself Out?"" After a break, he'll talk about two other developments he says could threaten humanity as we know it - human genetic engineering and artificial intelligence - and why he says there's still hope for meaningful change. Also, rock critic Ken Tucker reviews a new album from the British band The Mekons. I'm Dave Davies, and this is FRESH AIR.
(SOUNDBITE OF ROSWELL RUDD & TOUMANI DIABATE'S ""BAMAKO"")
DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies, in for Terry Gross, who's off this week. We're speaking with writer and environmental activist Bill McKibben. His first book, ""The End Of Nature,"" became a bestseller in 1989 and ignited debate about climate change. He's written 14 books since and founded the environmental organization 350.org. His new book is called ""Falter: Has The Human Game Begun To Play Itself Out?""
The book isn't just about climate change. I mean, you are looking at what you say is the human game - this great endeavor - and whether it is sustainable in the coming years. And you identify a couple of other threats to humanity as we know it. One is genetic engineering. Why?
MCKIBBEN: Genetic engineering of human beings - you probably saw this story on the front of the Times over the weekend about the doctor in China who apparently, with American help, managed to produce the first two designer babies in the world, a pair of twins in China who'd been genetically altered. This feels like where we were decades ago with climate change - right on the cusp of revolutionary shifts. And those shifts are things that we should take very seriously. We overestimated and took for granted the physical stability of the planet, refused to believe that it could change. We take for granted the idea that human meaning is eternal, too.
But think about what happens if we go very far down the road that a lot of scientists and a lot of entrepreneurs have described - a world where you go into a clinic and put your money down and design, to the best of science's ability, the child you want to produce. You may soon be able to figure out how much serotonin, you know, your child produces in an effort to regulate its mood. You may be able to affect, in some way, small or large, its intelligence.
Think about what that means - first, the fact that the minute you turn a person into a product, that product faces the inevitable fate of all products - obsolescence. You've been in the clinic with your first kid, put down your money, made your selections. OK. You come back five years later for kid number two. Technology has marched on. You're able to get better upgrades for this one.
These are changes that we should avoid and that we can avoid without risk to human health. We know other ways to prevent the transmission of genetic disease and things. This is a real challenge to human beings, I think, and one that we haven't taken seriously enough yet - that these two Chinese babies born last fall seem to have sobered up some of the scientific community. And there's been increased talk about regulation within and outside of the scientific community to try and slow things down.
DAVIES: Well, you know, in addition to the issues that you raised, you know, we have a lot of inequality. This - these kinds of treatments would cost money over time. Does it end up with, really, kind of two scales of human beings, one which are - have better mood regulation, who are intellectually brilliant, athletically powerful, and then others who can't afford this? I mean, where does that take us?
MCKIBBEN: The head of one of the gene companies at the moment - a Princeton professor - said some years ago that it was only a matter of time before we bifurcated into two species. He called them the GenRich and the naturals. And he predicted that it wouldn't be long before they wouldn't be able to even breed with each other, much less want to, because they'd be on very different paths. This is a way of taking the shameful inequality that mars our society now and that one hopes we are in the process of rebelling against and figuring out how to start changing - it takes that inequality and etches it into our genes.
DAVIES: Describe the Chinese baby experiment.
MCKIBBEN: A doctor in China, in embryo, altered the genetic makeup of twin girls in order to produce - to make it impossible for them to get HIV. As every doctor and other authority pointed out once this became public, this - even if you wanted to do this kind of work, this was in - a bad place to start because there are a thousand easy ways to make sure you don't get HIV once you're born. This was just an attempt at a kind of proof of concept - to be the first person who produced a designer baby. That's why people reacted strongly to it. Even, I'll say, the Chinese government reacted strongly to it. And this researcher is in a good deal of trouble, as he should be, for proceeding blindly down this path.
DAVIES: The other threat you identify is artificial intelligence, and this is really interesting stuff. Let's just start by defining it because a lot of us think we know what it means and don't. What is artificial intelligence?
MCKIBBEN: (Laughter) Well, the definitional problems are rife in the field. Suffice it to say, there's several different kinds. We already have specific artificial intelligences, right? We have computers that are able to - programs that are able to beat human beings reliably at chess and pretty much every other game. And now we're weaponizing them to do all kinds of things, some of which are really dark.
There was a story in the paper about the fact that the Chinese have developed an AI algorithm that can facially identify Uyghur Muslims anywhere in China and pick them out of crowds in any city. And police departments are deploying this across the People's Republic in order to keep track of this racial minority. That's one of the things we have, I'm afraid, to look forward to in the future.
The deeper fears - the sort of real fears about human meaning come when you posit, as many, many scientists do, what they would call general artificial intelligence - AIs designed not for specific tasks, but for broad intelligence - able to teach themselves and to learn and to quickly become more intelligent, maybe a lot more so than human beings. The scientists who work in this field tell us that this is going to happen soon. The definition of soon ranges from 2025 to 2050 or 2060, but those are the consensus predictions within the field. And we haven't at all begun to think out what that means. We've started to worry that people will lose their jobs to automation, which is something very much to worry about, but we haven't really thought about what it means to replace ourselves with something above us.
DAVIES: You know, I'm struggling to understand kind of what the threat is posed by this kind of artificial intelligence, and part of it's because we just don't...
MCKIBBEN: Well, that's 'cause you need to be...
DAVIES: Right.
MCKIBBEN: ...Upgraded so you'll caughten (ph) on more quickly, Dave.
DAVIES: Right. My grandson will have the chip that can do that. But, I mean, to be specific - I mean, there's the movie ""I, Robot,"" where the robots eventually learn that - they start killing human beings on the street because they've taken over. There are a couple of examples in the book of how you give a robotic intelligence a goal, like making paper clips - right? - or...
MCKIBBEN: This is the classic canonical example in the field. You assign artificial intelligence the task of making paper clips, and it won't be deviated from this task. It gets - it pursues it single-mindedly, as only a machine could, and figures out how to keep you from turning it off 'cause that's not a very hard task for a super intelligent machine. And it figures out how to divert all - in fact, all the powers of the planet to making yet more paper clips until pretty soon, we're reduced to a kind of pile of them. We haven't taken it seriously because it doesn't, at the moment, seem to impinge on our day-to-day life. But one of the things that climate change taught me is that things happen fast - like, really fast. And before you know it, they're out of control. So the time for thinking about them is when there's still some chance at getting a handle on them.
DAVIES: Bill McKibben's new book is called ""Falter: Has The Human Game Begun To Play Itself Out?"" We'll talk some more after a short break. This is FRESH AIR.
(SOUNDBITE OF AMANDA GARDIER SONG, ""FJORD"")
DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. Our guest is Bill McKibben. He's been writing about and advocating for action on climate change since the 1980s. He's the author of 15 books. His latest is called ""Falter: Has The Human Game Begun To Play Itself Out?""
The last section of your book is called ""Outside Chance"" - you know, hope, but just a little bit, maybe. You said you find hope in two new technologies. One is the solar panel, and you say you kind of fully realized its possibilities on a reporting trip to Africa. What did you find?
MCKIBBEN: Look. I'm a good child of the American suburbs, so I grew up taking everything we take for granted for granted. And I got into Ivory Coast and Ghana and Tanzania into remote villages where people have never had electricity. I was sitting around one day with elders in this community in Ghana who had just had their first power from a solar microgrid. It was hot 'cause it's always hot there, and they kept handing me bottles of cold water to drink, for which I was grateful. But it took me a good 15 minutes to figure out why they were so proud of that. It's because there'd never been anything cold in this hot place before until solar panels had allowed them access to electricity.
If you look at it that way, a solar panel is Hogwarts-scale magic, man. You point a sheet of glass at the sun, and out the back comes light and cold and information and all the things of modernity. And it does it without causing the damage that burning fossil fuels does. It's pretty magical stuff.
DAVIES: Right, and it can transform a home or a village in Africa. Can it scale up to meet the energy needs of an industrial society?
MCKIBBEN: We used to wonder about that. Two things have happened in the last little while. One is this dramatic fall in the price of solar panels and wind turbines. The other is a dramatic fall in the price of storage batteries. So now we're at the point where the fact that the sun goes down at night is not a deal-breaker. Increasingly, we're able to take that power and store it. There was a story in Bloomberg a couple of weeks ago saying that solar-plus batteries is now cheaper than natural gas, even in much of the United States. So even without the dire threat posed by climate change, we'd probably be moving in this direction. Because of the dire threat posed by climate change, we should be moving in this direction as fast as it is possible to imagine doing.
DAVIES: Right. You live in Vermont. Do you have solar panels in your house?
MCKIBBEN: I have solar panels all over my roof. And I'm glad for them, but I try not to fool myself that that's how we're going to solve climate change. We're past the point where we can do this one house at a time. That's the other kind of miracle technology that we have to work with now from the 20th century. It's this idea of nonviolent movement building, the idea that individuals can become a little less individual and join together with others to form movements big enough, maybe, to take on even the power and wealth of the fossil fuel industry.
DAVIES: Yeah. Well, you know, it struck me that one of the things that was interesting about what you found in Africa was that these solar panels were being sold by entrepreneurs, right? I mean, there's money to be made in this. What about the big energy companies taking this on and making that their project?
MCKIBBEN: Well, you would've thought they would've 30 years ago. And the reason they didn't is because you can make money off the sun and the wind, but you can't make Exxon kind of money. And the reason is that once the solar panel's up there on your roof, the sun comes for free.
From Exxon's point of view, that's the stupidest business model possible. They've spent a century getting people to write them a check every month for another delivery, but the sun delivers it for free. That's why they've worked so hard to derail this technology. And it's why, if we deploy it and as we deploy it, not only do we do something about climate change, we also may do something about the imbalances of power and wealth in our society, much of which is based on the fact that people just happen to live above or control the small deposits of coal and oil and gas on which we depend. They'll be rich people in a solar world, but they won't be Koch brothers rich. And they won't have that degree of warping influence on our politics.
DAVIES: You've said many times that the question is, can we make change quickly enough? Give us a sense of the - what kind of time pressure we're under.
MCKIBBEN: The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, our collection of scientists around the world, organized - sort of self-organized, put out their most important report to date last autumn. It said that to meet the targets set in Paris, we would need fundamental transformation underway by 2030. That is, in this country, we'd need to be - at least half our power coming from renewable sources. That's a really hard transition to make in 10 years. It requires a level of focus and attention that we've never come close to in the past on this issue. So it's going to take everything we've got to get it done.
DAVIES: If things don't happen in time, one of the things that people are talking about are big bioengineering solutions - I mean, like, you know, towers into the sky to pump gases or extract gases. And I can't even recall all of them. I've read books about them. How do you feel about those ideas?
MCKIBBEN: The most common of these is to say we'll fly a constant fleet of airplanes for the rest of time into the atmosphere, dumping sulfur there. And the sulfur will block some of the incoming solar radiation. The craziness of this is manifold. I mean, look. It would probably change the color of the sky to a nice milky white. We think that this mimics what happens with volcanoes when they put a lot of sulfur into the atmosphere and temporarily cool the planet.
But one of the things that often happens then is that the monsoon rains move off the subcontinent, which is an existential problem for a couple of billion people. More to the point, none of this does anything about the deadly twin of global warming, which is the rapid acidification of the oceans. We're an ocean planet. The fact that we're - have already made the oceans 30 percent more acidic would be, by itself, enough reason to get off fossil fuel, even if it didn't do a thing to the temperature. We don't need to pour sulfur into the atmosphere. We need to build a lot of windmills and solar panels.
DAVIES: One other thing - you know, we live in a time where civility is in short supply. And you've been trolled and harassed for your activism. What kinds of things have you faced?
MCKIBBEN: There was a long time when I didn't talk about any of it. But in the last few years, I've written some about the death threats, which have been a kind of standard-issue part of life for 30 years. We're reaching the point where people on the Internet were, you know, publishing my home address and talking about the specific methods they planned to use and so on and so forth. That kind of incivility - if that seems almost too weak a word for it - is part of our life now. But we can't let it be the thing that keeps us from doing our work.
All of this seems crazy to me, at some level. When I set out on this journey, I was a writer, not an activist. It never occurred to me that I was going to end up in jail or in handcuffs a bunch of times and things. And one shouldn't have to. I mean, in a rational world, when scientists issue a blunt warning that the worst thing in the world is happening, you would expect our leaders to go to work.
But the world in which we live in, apparently, people do have to do these kind of things. And people have to deal with a lot worse than I have to deal with. There's people around the world - environmentalists - who die every year in countries where this sort of thing has become routine.
DAVIES: Well, Bill McKibben, thanks so much for speaking with us again.
MCKIBBEN: Dave, what a pleasure. And thank you not just for this interview but for all your work every day. We really enjoy it.

A day after flames leaped through Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris sparking fears the beloved building could be consumed, Parisians sang and prayed in processions through the streets and held vigils Tuesday evening close to the church constructed more than eight centuries ago.
The cathedral stood blackened with much of its roof gone, its spire collapsed and charred rubble inside, but it remained standing, its main structure and two towers spared.

Construction first began on the Catholic cathedral in 1163. For 850 years, the house of God was a fixture of the Paris skyline and so it also became a house of man, ""part of our French destiny,"" as Macron tweeted Monday.
Notre Dame's destiny was in question through the night as hundreds of firefighters worked to put out the blaze. They managed to contain the flames early Tuesday morning local time.

Christophe Petit Tesson/AP By midmorning, the fire was fully extinguished, and an investigation into the cause began in earnest.
Paris public prosecutor Rémy Heitz told reporters that the fire was discovered in the attic's framework and is believed to have been accidental. Investigators in the early stages of a probe, he said, have detected no signs of arson. But Heitz cautioned the investigation will be ""long"" and ""complex"" as dozens of investigators work to uncover what happened. Part of their job is interviewing workers who were engaged in a multi-million-dollar restoration project of the cathedral before the fire broke out around 6 p.m. local time Monday.
Nobody was killed. Officials said two police officers and one firefighter were slightly injured.

Hundreds of millions of dollars have already been pledged by some of France's wealthiest names, including the Bettencourt Meyers family, Bernard Arnault and François Pinault .
European Council President Donald Tusk called on all 28 members of the European Union to join in on the effort.
President Trump offered condolences to France, reaffirming the alliance between the two countries.
""We remember with grateful hearts the tolling of Notre Dame's bells on September 12, 2001, in solemn recognition of the tragic September 11th attacks on American soil,"" the White House said in a statement. ""Those bells will sound again. We stand with France today and offer our assistance in the rehabilitation of this irreplaceable symbol of Western civilization. Vive la France!""
Macron said in his address Tuesday that the fire can be turned into an opportunity to come together. ""We will act and we will succeed."""
What Personality Tests Tell Us About Ourselves,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/12/712876949/what-can-a-personality-test-tell-us-about-who-we-are,"Enlarge this image Courtesy of Pottermore.com Courtesy of Pottermore.com In one of the most famous scenes from the Harry Potter series, a group of kids, new to the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, line up before an old and crumpled wizard's hat. It is the sorting hat. The hat will tell them which house they'll belong to during their Hogwarts education.
There is something deeply appealing about the sorting hat. It is wise. It seems to know people better than they know themselves.
We humans love this kind of insight. And our drive to better understand ourselves and the people around us has led to the creation of a multi-billion dollar industry built around personality testing.
Probably the most famous of all personality tests is the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, or MBTI. But there are plenty of others, too. These tests categorize people based on personality traits. Are you an introvert or an extrovert? Someone who likes unexpected challenges, or someone who prefers structure and calm? Many of America's most successful companies use personality tests to gain a better understanding of their workers. Many individuals use them to gain a better understanding of themselves.
One Hidden Brain listener, Ally Adler, took the Myers-Briggs test when she was 26 and miserable in her job.
""It really helped me understand myself in a way that I hadn't before so I could work around and manage challenges both in my personal and professional life,"" she says.

Tara Boyle/NPR But other people say tests like these are deeply flawed. Listener Matthew Gale says the Myers-Briggs got him completely wrong.
""My experience with Myers-Briggs played no small part in ruining me emotionally for years,"" he says.
While the effectiveness of these tests can be endlessly debated, one thing is clear. With a few exceptions, most do not stand up to scientific scrutiny. They typically aren't peer reviewed and usually fail basic standards of validity and reliability. Adam Grant , a psychology and management professor at the University of Pennsylvania, has written of his concerns with the Myers-Briggs, particularly when companies use the results to guide hiring and firing decisions.
""It's a great way to weed out diversity,"" Grant says.
Allen Hammer, the former chair of the Myers & Briggs Foundation , disagrees. He believes the Myers-Briggs is as reliable as other personality tests. And he says Grant is wrong when it comes to evidence that the Myers-Briggs cannot predict real world outcomes; for example, he says, ""when people matched roommates on their psychological type they got a 65 percent decrease in request for roommate changes.""
This week, we delve into the world of personality tests, and discover new research that suggests the power of personality assessments may not be in pinpointing the person you are , but the person you have the potential to become.

Harold Shapiro/Yale University/AP David Brion Davis, the celebrated historian whose works challenged the accepted wisdom about slavery, radically repositioning the brutal practice at the very heart of Western development, died Sunday at the age of 92. Yale University, where Davis taught for decades, said Monday that the scholar died of ""natural causes.""
""Over the course of his prodigious and extraordinary career, Professor Davis transformed the study of slavery and abolition and inspired generations of historians beyond his own field,"" university President Peter Salovey said in the statement. ""His willingness to ask new questions and seek larger truths inspires us still.""
Davis wrote or edited 16 books — none more influential than his seminal trilogy, The Problem of Slavery, an opus that took 38 years from the publication of the first volume to the last. All told, the series — which broadly examined slavery's central role and complex legacy in the West — earned Davis a Pulitzer Prize , a National Book Award and a National Book Critics Circle Award , among many others.
By the time Davis concluded the trilogy, with the publication of The Problem of Slavery in the Age of Emancipation in 2014, he had achieved the feat of ""reshaping our understanding of history."" That's according to the citation for the National Humanities Medal, the highest honor awarded by the National Endowment for the Humanities, which Davis received from President Obama the very same year.
""A World War II veteran, Davis has shed light on the contradiction of a free nation built by forced labor,"" the citation explains, ""and his examinations of slavery and abolitionism drive us to keep making moral progress in our time.""

Alex Wong/Getty Images In the first volume, 1966's The Problem of Slavery in Western Culture , Davis traced the evolution of ideas and arguments that have defined the West's perspective on human bondage — from the Bible and Ancient Greece through the tumultuous era that saw the practice, once accepted without question, become reviled and eventually widely abolished.
In the second volume, published roughly a decade later under the title The Problem of Slavery in the Age of Revolution , he linked that intellectual revolution with the industrial one unfolding around the same time. The 19th-century rise of capitalism, Davis asserted in this volume, can't be separated from radical shifts in beliefs about what kinds of labor are acceptable and their unintended consequences.
And in the finale, released as Davis was approaching his 90s, he focused on the role played by the slaves themselves in bringing about their freedom.

What's an artist's obligation to address politics and injustice?
For musician Rosanne Cash, it's a major responsibility.
Between recording and performing, she makes time to speak up about major issues including copyright protection, fair compensation for songwriters, the #MeToo movement and gun control.
She recently wrote an op-ed for Billboard about her experience with sexual misconduct.
Here's some of what she shared:
You can call Human Resources about ""sexual harassment."" But who do you call when the behavior in question isn't only tolerated but expected, encouraged, even applauded as part of a male artistic temperament that frames women as accessories without any regard for their experiences? Women were expected to adopt that temperament while being shamed for doing so.
Her latest album is called ""She Remembers Everything."" It took a look at life, love and womanhood.
We meet Rosanne Cash."

Parisians Say They Are In Great Pain Over Fire Damage To Notre Dame Cathedral : NPR,www.npr.org,Eleanor Beardsley,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/16/714073884/parisians-say-they-are-in-great-pain-over-fire-damage-to-notre-dame-cathedral,"Parisians Say They Are In Great Pain Over Fire Damage To Notre Dame Cathedral Parisians Say They Are In Great Pain Over Fire Damage To Notre Dame Cathedral Embed Embed
Parisians are coming to terms with the extensive damage done to the their beloved Notre Dame cathedral by Monday's fire.
AILSA CHANG, HOST:
The Cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris is disfigured but still standing after it burned for several hours yesterday. The fire is believed to have started accidentally amid scaffolding erected for a major renovation of its roof. Parisians say they are in great pain over the damage to a cathedral that has kept watch over their city for more than eight centuries. NPR's Eleanor Beardsley was at Notre Dame today and sends this report.
ELEANOR BEARDSLEY, BYLINE: Thousands of Parisians and tourists came out this morning to see the fire's damage by daylight. On a stretch of the Seine River just across from Notre Dame, people took pictures and simply stared in disbelief. Parisian Jean Houssain was among them.
JEAN HOUSSAIN: (Speaking French).
BEARDSLEY: ""I got up a little earlier this morning so I could stop by and see the cathedral,"" he says. ""I had a visceral need to come see her.""
Others voiced regret that maybe they had taken their beautiful Notre Dame for granted, like 18-year-old college student Lucie Lemaire, who says she's heartbroken.
LUCIE LEMAIRE: (Through interpreter) I'm super sad. I passed in front of it all the time, but I didn't really pay attention because it was a part of my daily routine. She's so beautiful. And this is an enormous loss. And it'll never be the same now.
BEARDSLEY: But President Emmanuel Macron told the nation that no matter the setback, France had always come back stronger.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: (Through interpreter) Throughout our history, we've built cities and ports and churches. And they've been destroyed by wars and revolutions and fire. But we've always rebuilt them. And the fire at Notre Dame reminds us that our history never stops. And we will always have challenges to overcome.
UNIDENTIFIED CROWD: (Singing in French).
BEARDSLEY: Last night, thousands of Parisians sang hymns and prayed as more than 400 firefighters risked their lives to save the cathedral. The building's structure, its facade and the two iconic bell towers were preserved. But the roof has been destroyed, and damage to the interior has been massive. Still, some relics were saved. And it looks like the cathedral's 16th century organ has survived said, Michel Aupetit, the Archbishop of Paris.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
MICHEL AUPETIT: (Through interpreter) I think it is preserved. Of course, there will be a lot of tuning and repairs to do with the heat it suffered. It'll take some work. But at least it did not go up in smoke.
BEARDSLEY: Although Notre Dame is a Catholic cathedral, Parisians of all faiths and backgrounds embraced it. Taxi driver Bashir Arbouuli brought me to Notre Dame this morning. This Muslim who's, originally from Tunisia, says he can hardly bear to look at Notre Dame today. He says he's always thought of it as more than just a church.
BASHIR ARBOUULI: (Through interpreter) It's not about religion. It's about 800 years of history of France and the whole world, really. It's a symbol that's even stronger than religion.
BEARDSLEY: Deputy Interior Minister Laurent Nunez said firefighters and engineers will spend 48 hours securing the structure before anyone is allowed inside. Nunez said it was an extremely close call.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
LAURENT NUNEZ: (Through interpreter) A handful of firefighters risked their lives to go up the towers and attack the fire from the inside. And this helped save the edifice. We only realized this morning that we came within about half an hour or even 15 minutes of losing it all.
BEARDSLEY: President Macron spoke for many in France when he pledged to rebuild Notre Dame and make it even more beautiful.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
MACRON: (Through interpreter) French citizens and foreigners who love Paris, I want to tell you tonight that I share your pain. But I also share your hope. We have much to do. We will act, and we will succeed. Long live the republic. And long live France.
BEARDSLEY: Restoration experts are already being recruited, and funds are pouring in. The president said France is a nation of builders. And he believes Notre Dame can be fully restored in just five years. Eleanor Beardsley, NPR News, Paris. Copyright © 2019 NPR. All rights reserved.

As presidential hopefuls enter the Democratic primary contest, they have to figure out how to raise the money they need, and the different options available.
AILSA CHANG, HOST:
One way to measure a candidate's credibility and staying power in the early stages of a campaign is to look at fundraising. And so far, according to new Federal Election Commission disclosures, President Trump and Senator Bernie Sanders have the financial edge in the 2020 presidential race. NPR's Peter Overby has more.
PETER OVERBY, BYLINE: The financial reports for the first quarter have all been filed, and 17 Democrats managed to raise at least a million dollars each. Progressive consultant Connor Farrell lists the leaders starting with Bernie Sanders.
CONNOR FARRELL: He's raised 18 million. The next closest is Kamala Harris, who raised around 12 or 13 million, followed by Beto O'Rourke at 9, Pete Buttigieg at 7.
OVERBY: The candidates are especially chasing small donors, the kind of people who give online and do it again and again.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
PETE BUTTIGIEG: I'm going to need your help. If you're ready for a new generation of American leadership, I hope you'll consider joining our grassroots fundraising team.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
ELIZABETH WARREN: I don't take corporate PAC money. Shoot, I don't take PAC money of any kind.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
CORY BOOKER: I said I will not take corporate contributions.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND: And I don't believe we should have individual super PACs. So please give.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
KAMALA HARRIS: Go to kamalaharris.org, and you will find it.
OVERBY: Those are Buttigieg, Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker, Kirsten Gillibrand and Harris. The disclosure reports don't break out how donors give, but they do give a lump sum total for all contributions of $200 or less. That would include most of the online donors. Sanders' small donor total is $15 million. O'Rourke got 5 1/2. And Buttigieg is third with 4 1/2. Farrell said Buttigieg raised more than half his total without doing a big ask.
FARRELL: He has not spent or at least is not reporting any spending on digital advertising which all of the other major candidates are spending heavily on.
OVERBY: Another key number in the reports is cash on hand. Four candidates reported $10 million or more. And two of them are senators - Gillibrand and Warren - who were able to transfer funds from their Senate campaign accounts. There are concerns that some Democratic campaigns are overusing their digital fundraising lists. Tim Lim is a media consultant in Washington.
TIM LIM: This insistence on getting rapid, quick returns from your digital acquisition programs will only burn out the list - the email list quicker.
OVERBY: And another larger concern is whether Democrats are so focused on the primaries that they lose sight of their actual goal. President Trump's campaign reported receipts of $30 million. That includes money raised by the Republican National Committee and two joint fundraising committees. Trump started fundraising right after he took office two years ago. Total receipts for his coordinated campaign since then are a stunning $109 million. Lim said Democrats have to think past the primaries.
LIM: How do we make sure that the nominee has the best opportunity to beat Donald Trump?
OVERBY: Trump, like most of the Democrats, has been pouring money into digital fundraising. Charlie Spies, a Republican campaign lawyer, said building a digital operation has become the defining trait of a successful campaign. Between that and the Trump RNC fundraising network, Spies said things look pretty good.
CHARLIE SPIES: The one thing we know is that President Trump is extraordinarily well-positioned going into the election.
OVERBY: And Connor Farrell, the progressive consultant, said he hopes the Democratic candidates are paying attention to this. But it's also worth noting that the winner of the money race doesn't always win the most votes. Peter Overby, NPR News, Washington. Copyright © 2019 NPR. All rights reserved.
